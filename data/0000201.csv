If you have 3 Dark ""Magician"" and 2 ""Red-Eyes B.

If you're a snake, that is.</span>  <span>Not only are we in the peak of snake season, roughly lasting from early April to late November, it is also past the release of their amphibian friends. And what's a party without friends. (&gt;^^)&gt; 'Cause ain't no party like a friendship party 'cause a friendship party never stops! &lt;(^^&lt;) But before we take a closer look at the deck, let's take a look at our snake's best friend...or in our case, new overlords.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Alien Stealthbuster"">Alien Stealthbuster</a><span>: This Wolverine from another planet can banish itself from the GY to target and destroy any card that has A-Counters on it. Sadly, you cannot use this effect the turn it is sent to the GY. But that's not what we're looking for anyways. Instead, this card places 2 A-Counters on a face-up on the field. This is a trigger effect and harmonizes well with Alien's other newcomer.</span></span></li>  	<li> <div id=""preview"" class=""cardfront unselectable""> <div class=""cardfront_content""><span class=""name_txt selectable""><span><a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a></span>: Okay before I talk about this card. Why Konami, why is this card called ""Slicer""? This nightmarish Mr. Krabs has claws...ALSO CALLED PINCERS! It is also not an Alien by name but I think the design speaks for itself here. Now with the namesake out of the way let's answer the scientific question of ""what this do?"" Ever heard of Mystic Mine? Don't worry, it's not that bad. Your opponent's monsters with an A-Counter are switched to Defense Position and cannot activate their effects. Kind of like Bagooska but better. So it's a walking - or crawling, I can't really tell - floodgate. On Link Summon this card also searched any card that has an effect that places A-Counters. The wording on this card is luckily very broad, allowing you to search a myriad of cards. You can also remove 2 A-Counters from anywhere on the field to Normal Summon a Reptile.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div id=""preview_txt"" class=""textarea scrollpane selectable os-host os-theme-dark os-host-resize-disabled os-host-transition os-host-overflow os-host-overflow-y"" tabindex=""0""> <div class=""os-size-auto-observer""></div> </div></li> </ul> <span>Here's a disclaime</span>r: I know you can achieve this Slicer Lock with relative ease in an Ogdoadic deck and even add up to 11 cards to your hand in the progress with a single starter. But this deck is trying to be competitively viable. The reason you don't see a deck that can draw 11 cards on turn 1 top is because, frankly, it's not that consistent. Any handtrap can stop you and then there's not too much else for you to go into. Besides that you go through all your Ogdoadic cards during your combo and keeping them live in your GY for the following turn, so drawing 8 more of them isn't really all that is seems to be. And even if you end up with your combo, you may have a lock on the board but no negates or protection to keep it live.  Instead, this deck is trying to consistently as possible not only establish the lock, but also set up a Dingirsu or Hope Harbinger to protect your Slicer from card effects. At the same time it aims to make sure you can always access an alternative endboard.  &nbsp;  <span>The Slicer Lock:</span>  Usually you want to end on <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a></span> plus either <span><a data-name=""Alien Kid"">Alien Kid</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""&quot;A&quot; Cell Recombination Device"">""A"" Cell Recombination Device</a></span> or any Alien and <span><a data-name=""Planet Pollutant Virus"">Planet Pollutant Virus</a></span> to prevent your opponent from activating any monster effects. Only their Normal Summon can activate their trigger or quick effect before you can lock your opponent but that's not too worrying.  The problem with this is that this lock requires Slicer and 2 additional cards. However Slicer can only add one of these to your hand. You could open the other one but that's 1 handtrap or extender less in your opening hand.  Instead this deck aims to end on <span><a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a></span> plus <span><a data-name=""Alien Kid"">Alien Kid</a></span> and <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star""><span>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</span> or </a><a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>. This allows their normal summon to activated it's ignition effects and attack your Kid but with Dingirsu or Harbinger on your side of the field you don't have to worry about that.  &nbsp;  <span>The Combo:</span>  All you need is either Snake Rain and a single extender or Nunu and two extenders. Remember how I said this combo was non-linear? Depending on your hand, cards like Nauya can change the line of plays and extenders needed. In the end it's best to to some test hands and get to know which cards can achieve what endboard. Anyways, you're not allowed to embedd DB replays into your deck description so <strong>I'll post the combo replay into the comments</strong> and give you some remarks here. <ul>  	<li>This is possible regardless of the extender.</li>  	<li>If you open <span><a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a></span> you can search <span><a data-name=""Kagetokage"">Kagetokage</a></span> instead. You have to keep him until you summon Alien Kid and then tribute him for Aleirtt. This might require you to send a Reptile for Snake Rain/Zohah, can't remember to be exact.</li>  	<li>Before anyone tries to backseat in the comments. Yes, you can summon <span><a data-name=""Nunu, the Ogdoadic Remnant"">Nunu, the Ogdoadic Remnant</a></span> if you control a non-Ogdoadic as long as you control an Ogdoadic monster, too.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>The Card by Card:</span>  Well not exactly card by card. I'll just explain some of the choices I made. <ul>  	<li>Extenders: <ul>  	<li>I'm playing the Level 4s at 2 copies a piece since 6 in total are enough and both <span>P</span><a data-name=""rimula the Rikka Fairy""><span>rimula the Rikka Fairy</span></a> and <span><a data-name=""Stardust Trail"">Stardust Trail</a></span> do the exact same. Stardust Trail can summon itself from the GY, which is great but 2-2 is definitly better since the two in hand means one card is dead regardless.</li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a></span> is the best in my opinion. This one doesn't help with <span><a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a></span> but instead helps with the r8nks. If you can't make the lock because you didnt draw the right cards or got interrupted this one can also loop a card out of your opponents hand, which is especially funny if you used <span><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a></span> previously this turn.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>All the Called By The Graves: <ul>  	<li>Besides the limited <span><a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a></span> this deck is playing 4 honorary Called By The Graves. There are a lot of steps in which Gamme is live, with Snake Rain for example, turning him into practically 3 more copies of Called By. The Last one is <span><a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a></span>, or rather <span><a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a></span>.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>The Combo Cards: <ul>  	<li>Usually you'll see <span><a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a></span> played at three. It is, however searched through the combo and opening it never feels that good. This deck is not reliant on a second Lily for follow-up plays so I cut it down to one.</li>  	<li>The Alien engine is also reduced to it's minimum. This deck only uses Kid for the Slicer lock so I cut all the other Alien cards. The one Alien Stealthbuster is in there since you might not always be able to use Tsuchinoko to gain A-Counters for Slicer. Also it's a nice follow-up when it's in the GY.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Honorable Mentions: <ul>  	<li>I could've included Accesscode but ED space is tight and I figured the deck isn't too dependent on it with <span><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></span>, yknow.</li>  	<li>You might've noticed that I play <span><a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a></span> instead of <span><a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a></span>. That's because next I don't see the point in running a knockoff Mechaba and forfeit any spot removal. Zoodiac doesn't care about negates, they summon a Zeus without activating a single effect, the meta is crawling with decks that can chainblock and with Swordsoul it'll only get worse. That's why I opted for the card that helps remove threats from the field.</li>  	<li>I guess you could play around with Trade-In, since the 8s are searchable with the Feral King, but I feel like that wouldn't make too much sense in this deck, that's so low on 8s.</li>  	<li>My last honorable mention are the Alien extenders. Both <span><a data-name=""Alien Overlord"">Alien Overlord</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Alien Dog"">Alien Dog</a></span> can extend. Overlord once you sent Stealthbuster and Alien Dog right at the end after summoning Kid off of Slicer. But these extenders extend a tad to late for my taste. I'm content with the numbers of extenders I'm running and they all feel better than these two.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Flexibility:</span>  <span>The reason I find this deck to be more competetively viable than other Ogdoadic Alien or Reptilianne-Add-Eleven-Cards builds is that through these extenders you'll find yourself to easily alternate from establishing the Slicer Lock to summoning a Dragoon of Verte. Since that requires less monsters you might very well have enough ressources to also summon a Teardrop or Harbinger in addition to that Dragoon. Yet there are still plenty of handtraps in this deck to make sure you don't auto-lose going second as well as increasing the strength on the board you end on. Dragoon itself may not do all that much, but add an</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a></span> <span>or</span> <span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></span> <span>into the mix and your might just have enough to turn it around next turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Side deck is full of random Ogdoadic cards as ygoprodeck seems to think I'm playing Aliens and Psy-Frames exclusively.</span> <div class=""cardfront unselectable""> <div class=""cardfront_content""></div> </div>"

Ideally, the strategy here is to swarm the field with the Battlewasps to go into your Synchro monsters and Synchro-climbing since Azusa counts as a Tuner monster as well. Parasite Paranoid is good to trap an opponent's monster and make them unable to attack your insects and then you can Cocoon of Ultra Evolution into a boss monster like Metamorphosed Insect Queen to give blanket protection to the insects. Corrosive Scales is good against other swarm decks as they'll just keep losing attack for every card they activate. Ideally you'd want to attached Scales to Uru to make you be unable to be attacked (as long as you have Spider Web on the field. NOTE: Field Barrier would be a good tech card to sub just in case). To help with the survivability, Scrum Force is used in tandem with Spider Web. Enjoy!"

So I have built a Beetrooper/Inzektor deck with a Dragoon splash. I am somewhat familiar with Inzektors as I came back into Yugioh around the time they were released though I do not know all of the cards or combos so advice is highly welcomed. The basic feel I got looking at these 2 is the Beetroopers supplementing the Inzektors in swarming out Extra Deck monsters as a combo deck. If there is anything that would be suggested to either change and all please do not hesitate to let me know, first deck I've built on my own in a long time. I also threw in Dragoon and components to see if it is viable to run, though if it seems too bricky please let me know."

He is a monster with 10,000 ATK in your turn and cannot be destroyed by battle  This Deck is centralized in Summoning Armityle the Chaos Phantasm through the effect of Armityle the Chaos Phantasm-Phantom of Fury or directly using the fusion magic of the archetype by Banishing from your Hand,Field and/or Graveyard the 3 Sacred beasts:Hamon,Raviel and Uria  <b>&#x26ab;</b>The Combo starters are:Dark Beckoning Beast And Opening of the Spirit Gates.  With Dark beckoning beast you can search for any card of the archtype and gives you an extra normal Summon of a Fiend 0ATK/0DEF Who are Dark Summoning Beast,Chaos Summoning Beast and Chaos core. With this card you mainly want to seek the opening of the spirit gates or if you started with opening you want to search Dark Beckoning beast. If You have the Opening in hand you could Search for Awakening of the Sacred Beasts,It allows you to gain effects according to the number of Sacred Beasts you control  With Opening of the Spirit gates is similar to the effect of Beckoning but you can only search Monsters of the Archtype  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Chaos Summonig Beast its one form to get on the field one Sacred Beast,is a level 1 monster that can be summon with one for one. The efect is he can tribute itself to summon from the hand Hamon,Raviel or Uria. He has other effect in the Gy that he can banish itself to search  Fallen Paradise  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Fallen Paradise,is the field spell that gives protect from targeting and protection from destruction of Spell Traps of the opponent and the other effect that you can draw 2 cards if you control a Sacred beast or Armityle in the field  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Dark Summoning Beast its the other form to get a Beast on the field,is a level 5 monster that you can search with Opening of the spirit gates or Dark Beckoning beast.This card can tribute itself to summon from the deck a Sacred Beast but you cannot attack until the end of this turn. While is on the Gy you can banish it to add a sacred beast from the deck to the hand  The 3 beasts has a support card who helps one or other beast:  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Hamon has Cerulean Skyfire:First you can summon hamon with face down spells.Its a Negate without responding by changing to defence hamon. When one Sacred Beast leaves the field you dont take any damage for the rest of the turn  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Uria has Hyper Blaze:You can summon Uria with face down traps.Whe Uria Attacks or its attacked you can send one continuous trap from the deck to the Gy and Uria will win ATK equal to the field Face traps x1000. The other effect is when you have a level 10 Monster you can discard one card and add from the Gy a Sacred  beast or special summon it ignoring it summon condition  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Raviel Has Shimmering Scraper:You can discard this card to double the ATK of Raviel and he can attack all the opponent monsters  <b>&#x26ab;</b>The Combo starters are:Dark Beckoning Beast And Opening of the Spirit Gates.If you start with one you search the other. <p class=""tw-data-text tw-text-large XcVN5d tw-ta"" dir=""ltr"" data-placeholder=""Traducción""><b>&#x26ab;</b><span>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts:It has 3 Effects depending of the Diferent Sacred Beasts you control_First:You gain life when your oponent summon a monster by its ATK_Second:Your opponent has his activated monsters effect negated_Third:Any monster that is sent to the oponent gy is Banished insted</span></p> (Heres a Basic Combo)If you start with the 2 searchrs you can do this:Start with opening of the spirit gates Search Dark summoning beast,then you normal summon Dark Beckoning Beast then search Chaos summoning beast.  Now in hand you have Dark and Chaos Summoning beast.You use the effect of the extra normal summon of Beckoning and tribute summon Dark Summoning,then use the effect to summmon a Sacred Beast. Now you have 2 fiends 0ATK/0DEF in gy.The next thing you would do is ti use the seccond effect of opening to discard for cost Chaos and summon it. Now you use the effect in gy of Dark summoning to search the other beast you want to summon with chaos summonig beast. You use Chaos summoning beast effect to tribute it and summon the beast you search with dark summoning beast or other in your hand. After you do that you use the second effect of Chaos summoning beast to add Fallen paradise and activate it and draw 2 cards.  N<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">ow the combo is divided into several things because you would have approximately 5 cards still, you can do several things if for example ... You have the third other beast in hand(Now you can do two things to end in Armityle)First:use directly Dimension Fusion Destruccion to end in Armityle and have it indestructible with Fallen paradise and his protection from destruction+the damage negated for the Fusion Card or the Other Armityle to sweap the oponent board by banishing all the cards he controls in the end phase and summon the Armityle ingnoring his summon conditions.Second:If You dont have the Fusion Card you use the 2 beasts you would control to make Verte anaconda and use his effect to send the card and summon one or other armityle.</span>  Other combo to get fast Armityle is With the two starters,search for example with dark beckoning beast opening of the spirit gates,or vice versa its the same but with the other you search you would add Chaos core then normal summon Chaos core with the Extra of Dark Beckoning beast,now you link summon almiraj with Dark Beckoning Beast and use its effect to target Chaos core and use the effect of Chaos core to send the 3 Sacred Beasts to the Gy,now you have the materials in Gy the next thing you should do to get Armityle is two things use the effect of Opening of spirit gates to special summon Dark Beckoning Beast then link summon with the two effect monster Verte Anaconda and use the effect to send Dimension Fusion Destruction and Summon Armityle. The other thing you can do its use Dimension Fusion Destruction from your hand insted of using the effect Verte Anaconda  With the Pot you can Recycle the three materials for Armityle or Chaos summoning beast ,Dark summoning beast  and other monster used for Allure of Darkness  &nbsp;"

Okay, so look, Evil Eyes are actually pretty close. This is for one reason and one reason alone - Serziel equipped with Selene represents a hard to interact with interruption, and potentially doubles as an engine piece depending on how your own deck is constructed. This means Serziel and your field spell both represent one easy interruption, and you can build the rest of the deck, theoretically, not around bad Evil Eye cards, but around another engine that interacts on a one-for-one basis.  Trying to decide on that engine took me a little bit of thought. Since Serziel is our normal summon and we don't end on an extra-deck monster Dogmatika was out, and so were a lot of the engines that might benefit from Serziel on the table. We want it to be a backrow deck if possible, and if possible we want it to benefit from popping our own cards. Eldlich was the obvious choice - it is a little light on the number of interruptions it puts on the table, but it has phenomenal grind game, good board breaking ability, and a fantastic boss monster in Eldlich the Golden Lord, conveniently a level 10 to make Trains (Choo choo!). The idea is to use our normal summon to drop Serziel and back him up with Golden land cards and good generic interruptions. Is this better than Ecclesia or Aleister? Oh almost certainly not. But it's a semi-competitive way to play Serziel, perhaps the most competitive way to play Serziel. And we can hope Fiend monsters get an actual good archetype sometime in the future.  I wanted to keep the Evil Eye package nice and tight. We have the field spell to search Serziel, which in this deck is much better than just seeing Serziel naturally, by virtue of putting an Evil Eye Spell Card on the field. This plus Cursed Eldland means you have Serziel setup + Eldlich right on the board. Very useful. We have Terraforming, our fourth copy of the field spell. We have Serziel, obviously. We have 1 Evil Eye of Selene, and one Evil Eye Retribution. Selene is obligatory, since it turns on Serziel while protecting him. We want something to search when we already have Selene, and a Spell negate is the obvious pick. In some situations game 2 it might be even more important to have the spell negate turn 1 than a repeatable pop anyways, and it is a good card to draw if you have Serziel. It also has some other good traits, like hitting traps and not being negatable, and being a countertrap as well.  The only problem I have with the Eldlich package is you really need to run a lot of cards to make it work. 3 Golden Lord seems essential, since you need to have one of these to turn on your traps and really you want as many as possible for the deck to work. Even semi-limiting this card would seriously reduce its grind game, and we want to take full advantage of having 3 copies. We also have 3 Cursed Eldland, which starts as 3 more copies of Golden Lord, but also adds Golden Land spells and works as a spell on the field for all that text on Eldlich. This plus Evil Eye Domain sets up your whole game. Golden Land Forever is your generic countertrap, it's honestly hard to evaluate this card. Being an Omni-negate counter trap is sometimes very good, but having to tribute a Zombie is really very bad, but it is searchable. 3 Conquistador seems essential, so we can loop our Lich cards long time. 2 Huaquero is fine, it frees up space for a single White Eldlixer. 3 Red is pretty obligatory in these lists, but I still really like the 1 White. It feels like you're leaving a lot of cards on the table when you don't run some of the bad Eldlixers. It's really only 1, but that one interruption is pretty important.  3 Pot of Extravagance, because we're a cheesy control deck that needs card advantage. Yes, Prosperity would help ensure our Evil Eye normal summ0n, but I actually think Eldlich wants the raw card advantage far more than Evil Eye wants the search, and the Eldlich engine is literally and figuratively bigger.  2 Dogmatika Punishment are run as good generic traps. These could be Solemns, or Compulse, or whatever you want to run, but I like the 2 for 1 of Punishment, and being locked out of the extra deck literally doesn't matter for this deck. Really, the fact that this list runs these is a sign I should just play Dogmatika engine over Evil Eyes, but I also can't think of a better shell for Evil Eyes. Like I said, Serziel is close.  Good hand traps are good. Called was such a good staple they limited it, and honestly? Still salty, but I'll run the 1."

I'll leave it here so feel free to check it out.</span>  <span>Everything in this deck is doing something. Between 16 handtraps, 7 backrow, 12 starter cards you only have 5 cards that don't enable some sort of interaction. And two of these - Invokation &amp; Artifact Scythe - still do if you also draw their respective half of the combo! So generally speaking you are running <em>37 interactive cards</em>.</span>  <span>I chose to forgo the HERO combos and instead focused solely on both Invoked and Destroy Phoenix Enforcer. Here are some bulletpoints regarding the cards and techs:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a></span> &amp; <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Disk Commander:""><span>Destiny HERO - Disk Commander</span>:</a> Instead of sending Celestial I opted for Disk Commander. It's hard to consistently empty your hand if you're running so many handtraps and play multiple cards that you can only use once a turn each (like Aleister and Meltdown). Since you'll be Fusion Summoning every turn you can consistently summon Disk Commander, draw 2 and then Link Summon <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></span> and still go plus 1.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a></span><span>: In case you draw both Fusion Destiny and the Sky Striker cards you can summon Dagda, set a Scythe and then pop if with DPE on your opponent's turn.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>The other Artifacts:</span> <span><a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a></span> <span>is not only great to summon off of <a data-name=""Artifact Sanctum"">Artifact Sanctum</a> but doesn't even brick since you can set it and destroy it with DPE.</span> <span><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></span> <span>can tribute itself from the field, just like it would in hand. So depending on the deck you're facing summoning this one might just give you the edge. Also functions as a handtrap if drawn.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a></span> &amp; <span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></span>: <span>Aleister is a Spellcaster and so is Veiler. Cross-Sheep could also summon Aleister from GY if you maange to get one in there (can also summon Veiler of course) to then summon Selene, resummon the Spellcaster of your choice and then push for lethal with Accesscode.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Sky-Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky-Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a></span>: <span>Depending on the gamestate you might want to search this off of Engage. Not only does this provide flexibility, it is also a solid card on it's own.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Mind that this is a decklist, that I can see myself playing with my own cards. Therefore I am only running what's available to me within my financial range. That's why I'm only running one Mechaba, Invokation and one DPE and also Almiraj and Gardna instead of Artemis. Out of all of these I'd recommend a second Mechaba the most and might just get my hands on another one myself, to summon a Mechaba with Mechaba to trigger the Cross-Sheep.</span>  <span>Dasher doesn't really do anything in this deck and can be substituted for literally any Level 6 or higher Destiny HERO. There's not many monster you'd like to summon, you could also play Plasma instead.</span>  Pot of Prosperity might also find it's place in a decklist or two, since there are a lot of situational cards in the ED."

I will still keep this up here on YGOProDeck so you can see what I had done here. Fortunately, if you are still wanting a guide to The Phantom Knights, I have a new one in the works. Keep your eyes peeled out for it! - Zeekou</strong>  &nbsp;  The Phantom Knights is an archetype of DARK Warriors that like to be in the graveyard to activate their effects. Dating all the way back to 2016 (saying that's 5 years ago feels illegal), in the set <em>Wing Raiders</em> along with Raid Raptors. Later in 2019, They got a new link monster in the <em>Legendary Hero Decks</em> box, which just like many other cards, got abused the hell out of in decks that aren't in the archetype itself. Later later, in 2020's set <em>Phantom Rage</em>, they got more support in the form of, most notably, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> along with some other support that tries to mix Phantom Knights and Raid Raptors together, tying back to <em>Winge Raiders </em>where they both debuted in, which is cute i guess. Now with an archetype that's been around for quite a while should have a good number of cards to go through, so let's just get into it in a chronological order. <h2>MONSTERS:</h2> <h3>The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> was originally released in <em>Wing Raiders </em>as an Ultra Rare. The card has two effects, The first one isn't great but it isn't particularly bad per say. The effect states: ""<strong>If this card is in Attack Position: You can target 1 DARK monster on the field; change this card to Defense Position, and if you do, that monster gains 800 ATK/DEF until the end of your opponent's turn.</strong>"" This effect has it's uses, such as buffing up your Bardiche to help protect it. this is actually it's greatest use, if you have a cloak on field during your combo, go ahead and activate it. No one in their right mind would want to negate it. The second effect is what makes this card good, the effect states: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your Deck to your hand, except ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>"".</strong>"" Just reading this effect you can know that this effect is really strong. Now to keep this a little bit less confusing, ""<strong><span>The Phantom Knights</span></strong>"" Cards are your monsters and your traps that can become monsters. Everything else in the archetype is just ""<span><strong>Phantom Knights</strong></span>"". to make this even easier to understand, every ""<span><strong>The Phantom Knights</strong></span>"" will be highlighted in Purple and ""<strong><span>Phantom Knights</span></strong>"" will be highlighted in Blue. Of course, both of these effects are a <strong>Hard Once Per Turn</strong>, so be sure to not activate his effects more than once.  Ratios: 2-3, in most builds, you're going to want at least 2 copies of this card. the utility it offers is just too great to pass up on. most of the time you can get away with 2 copies so for all you max-rarity lovers, don't worry about your bank account too hard here (although i doubt you guys do in the first place.) In some builds when you are just going for a PK engine, 1 of is perfectly fine and sometimes better than 2 <h3>The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</h3> Next up on the list is The <a data-name=""Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>, also releasing in <em>Wing Raiders </em>as a super rare. Like most other PKs, this card has two effects, one is a condition and the other an ignition. The condition effect reads: ""<strong>If you control a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can only Special Summon ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>"" once per turn this way.</strong>"" This is a strong reason to run Silent Boots in your deck already, getting a free body on board just for having another PK on board. It's perfectly fair that this effect is once per turn. The second effect is what makes this card so important to PK decks, the effect reads: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand. You can only use this effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>"" once per turn.</strong>"" Similarly to Ancient Cloak, this is an extremely useful search that opens up to free negates with <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>, but well get to that later.  Ratios 2-3. Even though you can do fine with just 2 copies, the sheer utility of this card makes it hard to not run a full playset. similarly to Ancient Cloak, when you are just going for a PK engine, just 1 copy can work better <h3>The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a> is an interesting card that only seems to have one effect but it actually has two. At the end of the card it reads: ""<strong>You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a>"" once per turn.</strong>"" now with that clause out of the way we can read the first effect: ""<strong>A DARK Xyz Monster that was Summoned using this card on the field as Xyz Material gains this effect. ● If it is Xyz Summoned: It gains 1000 ATK.</strong>"" now this is a hefty attack boost that most people forget about when this can determine whether or not a card lives or dies, although it barely comes up. Now another thing most people don't know about is that this effect is a <strong>Mandatory Effect</strong>. Meaning if you use this card for Xyz Material, <strong>You have to Activate it</strong>. The second effect of this card is the one everyone knows about it. It reads: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; send 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your Deck to the GY. </strong>"" this effect is extremely strong. being able to send any card in the <strong>Entire Archetype</strong> is pretty ridiculous.  Ratios: 1-2. Although the sending effect is extremely powerful, the deck already has the ability to get cards in the graveyard. Not running it is putting yourself in a handicap, but its not great enough card to warrant running 3. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor"">The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor</a> is a good card <em>On Paper</em>, with two effects that have uses the first one reads: ""<strong>If a face-up ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster(s) you control is destroyed by battle or card effect: You can Special Summon this card from your hand.</strong>"" this effect is good for keeping board presence and having an established grind game. The second effect isn't as great but it's also good: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY and send 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your hand to the GY; draw 1 card.</strong>"" this effect is very valuable, being able to set up your graveyard and replace it with a new card in the same effect is pretty strong for grind game. Much like almost every other Phantom Knight card, the text ends with the clause ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor"">The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor</a>"" once per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">""</span>  Ratios: none. even though these effects are strong, the fact that Fragile Armor is a level 4 stops it from being incorporated to more competent builds, and it honestly hurts me to say that because i love this card a lot. If only this card was level 3 it would automatically be a lot more useful to the point of being a 2-3of in every build. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm"">The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm</a> was meant to be the big beater of the deck just from reading the first effect: ""<strong>If a ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card(s) is sent to your GY: This card gains 500 ATK.</strong>"" now since this deck can send at least one card to the grave per turn, this card can get pretty strong pretty fast, the second effect isn't that good but can have a use or two, it reads: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; during the End Phase of this turn, add 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your GY to your hand.</strong>"" the only card this is useful for is recycling Phantom Knights' Fog Blade, but its not that useful. Of course the text ends with ""<strong>You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm"">The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm</a>"" once per turn.</strong>""  Ratios: none. there are a few reasons, the first being that his attack gain is a <strong>Hard Once Per Turn</strong>, the second reason is the graveyard effect only really has one use which requires setup and to put the nail in the ghostly coffin, it's a level 4. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</h3> The most recent support from <em>Phantom Rage</em> is where shit gets real. <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> was released as a secret rare in the set and for good reason. the first effect reads: ""<strong>You can discard 1 card; send 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your Deck to the GY, except ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>"".</strong>"" now this effect automatically gives PK a solid normal summon option, getting up to 2 Phantom Knight cards in the grave with just 1 effect! now the second effect is what seals the deal, it reads: ""<strong>If another ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card in your GY is banished, while this card is in your GY: You can Special Summon this card, but banish it when it leaves the field.</strong>"" this allows PK to have new combo routes just by doing things it would already be doing for combos! now that banish when it leaves the field clause sounds not so good but remember the confusing thing about Xyz Material. when a card is used for Xyz Material, they do not leave the field. This means if you use the effect to bring him back, just put him in an Xy monster for material and you just bypassed the entire downside of this card! now obviously this card has the ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>"" once per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" clause.</span> <div class=""card-arch"">Ratios: 2-3. although you only need 2 copies to do well with PKs, running 3 makes the deck just so much more consistent to pass up, being both a starter and an extender for the deck. But, if you are on a budget, running 2 is perfectly fine.</div> <h3>The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</h3> the other main deck monster added to the card pool from <em>Phantom Rage</em> is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>. with two effects that help combos be more explosive, the first reading: ""<strong>If a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster(s) is Special Summoned to your field (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, then you can increase the Level of this card by 1.</strong>"" allowing another free body one board is undoubtedly strong, along with the option to make it level 4 which is neat. The second effect doesn't tend to come up as often but it's also good, it reads; ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; Special Summon 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster from your hand, except ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>"", then you can increase its Level by</strong> <strong>1.</strong>"" Very similar to the first effect, also allowing the option for a level increase can come in handy for more specific combo routes. Of course this card has the once per turn clause that the rest of the cards do.  Ratios: 0-1. although not required in PK decks, it's handy to have on occasion. having more than 1 could brick your hand, but running none can put you out of a resource when you might need it. <h2>SPELLS:</h2> <h3>Phantom Knights' Spear</h3> <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Spear"">Phantom Knights' Spear</a> is one of 3 spell cards in the archetype, boasting 2 effects (shocker, i know) first one states: ""<strong>Each time your opponent activates a card or effect that targets a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster(s) you control, inflict 500 damage to your opponent immediately after it resolves.</strong>"" this effect is a bit redundant considering it has to be your opponent targeting your PKs, if this just said ""each time a card or effect that targets a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" card you control is activated, inflict 500 damage to your opponent."" this card would be exponentially better. similarly to the other two weapon cards, it has a second effect that reads: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">If a DARK monster you control would be destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, you can banish this card from your GY instead.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" unlike the traps that revive cards from the grave, this one wants to keep stuff on the field, with the additional upside that it's any DARK monster. still doesn't mean the card is good though.</span>  Ratios: don't. just don't, this card has no reason to be played, even for the miniscule burn damage which is just as effective as A B A K I <h3>The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</h3> the other spell from PKs debut is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic-Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic-Launch</a> (what a mouthful) this is the card that gives what extra deck type this would focus on, XYZ. The field effect is quite long, it says: ""<strong>During the Main Phase: Target 1 DARK Xyz Monster you control with no material; Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 DARK Xyz Monster that is 1 Rank higher than that monster you control, by using it as the Xyz Material, and if you do, attach this card to it as additional material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon. Transfer its materials to the Summoned monster.)</strong>"" now this effect is pretty strong considering by how generic it is, but it has the drawback that the monster you want to rank up needs no materials, so it requires setup a bit too long for today's standards. This card has a second effect when it's in the graveyard, it reads: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">During your Main Phase: You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 DARK Xyz Monster you control; attach 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster from your hand to that monster as material.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" this effect is also pretty strong to keep Xyz materials flowing in the main boss monster from then and still today: <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>.</span> <div class=""card-arch"">Ratios: 0-1. Despite the rather powerful effects, you really only want to run this if you want to do the <a data-name=""D/D/D Duo Dawn King Kali Yuga"">D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga</a> lock on your opponent's turn because of the setup it requires to be used in other instances.</div> <h3>Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</h3> the third and final spell in the archetype is also the only one with just one effect, releasing in <em>Phantom Rage</em>, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</a>, This effect is an actual wall so let's just have a look at it: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">During the Main Phase: Banish 1 or more DARK monsters from your GY, then target 1 DARK Xyz Monster you control; Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"", ""Raidraptor"", or ""Xyz Dragon"" Xyz Monster, whose Rank equals that of the targeted monster you control + the number of monsters banished, by using it as material, also for the rest of this turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck, except Xyz Monsters. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon. Transfer its materials to the Summoned monster.) You can only activate 1 ""<a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</a>"" per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">""  this effect is similar to the other RUM, but this card has the advantage that it doesn't require setup and it has extra flexibility.</span>  Ratios: 0-1. Despite the powerful effect, you'll really only use it to get Requiem on board and having more than 1 can brick your hand, unless you decide to play a strictly pure build where 2 if fine, run 1 if you aren't going for the Kali Yuga play. <h2>TRAPS (the longest segment):</h2> <h3>Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</h3> Starting with the most infamous card in the archetype, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> is an easily searchable card with two powerful effects, the first reading: ""<strong>Activate this card by targeting 1 Effect Monster on the field; negate that face-up monster's effects, that face-up monster cannot attack, also monsters cannot target that face-up monster for attacks. When it leaves the field, destroy this card</strong>"" obviously negates are powerful in a game like this, especially when they are easily accessible. the second effect is also fairly strong, it reads: ""<span class=""card-set-desc""><strong>You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster in your GY; Special Summon it, but banish it when it leaves the field. You can only use this effect of ""<a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>"" once per turn.</strong>"" obviously graveyard recursion with any monster in the archetype is pretty damn powerful, going back to the Torn Scales segment, you can completely bypass the banish downside by using the monster as Xyz Material.</span>  Ratios: 2-3. Running 2 gives you the ability to use one for a negate and the other as a combo extension. Running 3 however, gives you an extra PK name for the more grindy matches, but runs the risk of potentially clogging your hand. Use whichever suits your playstyle better. <h3>Phantom Knights' Sword</h3> the last of the weapons in the archetype, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a> was part of the original wave of Phantom Knight cards with two effects, the first reading: ""<strong>Activate this card by targeting 1 face-up monster on the field; it gains 800 ATK, also if that target would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy this card instead. When it leaves the field, destroy this card.</strong>"" This effect isn't all that bad, but that doesn't mean it's good. The 800 ATK boost is nice, along with a one time protection which also sets it up in the grave isn't all too bad, unfortunately in today's climate, it's too slow to reliably use. Speaking of the grave setup, this second effect is what you get: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster in your GY; Special Summon it, but banish it when it leaves the field. You can only use this effect of ""Phantom Knights' Sword"" once per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" that's right, the second effect is completely identical to Fog Blade's, and that's a good thing. Since Fog Blade's recursion effect is once per turn, using this card can allow you to get a second extension for combo routes.</span>  Ratios: 0-1. Despite the rather good effects, you aren't missing out on too much if you don't play it. Not to mention it's a bit of a garnet, the field effect is nice on occasion, but the grave effect is the main reason you would play it. Thankfully now, with Torn Scales, you can set it up in the grave much easier with their effect, i'd recommend running it instead of not at all, but then again, you don't miss out on too much if you don't. <h3 class=""card-arch"">Phantom Knights' Wing</h3> <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a> and <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a> are practically the same in terms of effects, the only differences between the two are literally that Wing gives 300 less ATK, their name (of course), and that Wing is a normal trap as opposed to Sword, a continuous.  Ratios: 0-1. If you were to run sword, run this instead. While it has less ATK gain (oh no, what am I going to do without my 1600 ATK Ancient Cloak?!!?) the fact it's a normal trap gives it the ability to activate it's grave effect almost immediately as opposed to Sword since it stays on field. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</h3> the first of the trap cards that are also monsters is also the most splashable card in the archetype, as it doesn't need any other PK card to function efficiently. Reading the card, you'll find ""<strong>Special Summon this card in Defense Position as a Normal Monster (Warrior/DARK/Level 4/ATK 0/DEF 300). (This card is NOT treated as a Trap.) If you have no Traps in your GY, you can activate this card the turn it was Set. You can only activate 1 ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>"" per turn.</strong>"" free board presence is always nice, especially with such a generic level being 4, as well as being a normal monster which can come into play if you're into those kinds of decks, on top of the fact it can be activated the turn it is set. take THAT <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>.  Ratios: 1. Always just play 1, any more can brick your hand especially because of it's level you can't really use it as a combo starter."

Normally they wouldn't really work together but the mermail and deep sea cards help support them and act as a kind of glue for the multiple archetypes. I hate seen all of the meta decks that do one thing over and over so in response I spent days making a deck myself that focused on making a variety of strong and adaptable plays. Most cards in the deck allow some form of search and removal. To be honest there are so many different combos I can't recall them all off the top of my head but the main ones that come to mind are the otk and the instant trishula combo. If you have nopenguin in your grave and penguin garden in your hand with one other card you can summon trihula from an empty board. Use garden to search emperor and then lower his level by 1 so you can normal summon him, then use his power to summon your second nopenguin and revive the first along with bringing out a copy of champion. Their total level is 11 and champion is a tuner so that's an instant trishula who will banish 3 cards your opponent controls. The other combo is an otk you usually start with having diva and one other water monster in your hand. It goes something like this: deep sea diva into neptabyss use his active to send dragoons to grave, add another water monster to hand with neptabyss and mermail abyssmegalo from dragoons then special summon megalo by sacraficing the 2 water monsters in hand then link summon marincess coral anemone with diva and neptabyss and use her ability to bring neptabyss back from the grave before sending it right back with megalos ability to let him attack twice and revive dragoons then you have a 2000 a 1800 and a 2400 that can attack twice all on field and you will also be able to remove cards from field before attacking if you used atlantean heavy infantry or atlantean marksman to summon megalo and summoning him lets you grab an equip that can cancel a trap card. and gives him 800 more attack for a total of 3200 that can swing twice along with the other monsters. These combos also have other ways to pull them off and are flexible in themselves. There are plenty more options available but you can discover them as you play the deck. In short I made this deck to be adaptable and versatile so you don't see the same thing over and over again but can still make strong plays. I hope people like it and try it out, have fun doing so!"

A Link 4 that can tribute herself on either players' turn to summon 2 Evil Twins or Live Twins from your Graveyard for a nice pop and draw, and then banish herself and pitch an Evil Twin to send a card to the Graveyard <em>without targeting</em>!  &nbsp;  What's best is, this deck can easily make it with one of the Cyberse Live Twins! And a hand consisting of that and a Parallell eXeed can result in a defense position Bagooska and Trouble Sunny! Oh, and if you draw a hand trap in addition to ending on a plus 3 and a Skill Drain on legs? Your opponent might as well just scoop! This deck also does fine going second, because it has 13 hand traps, 2 Cosmic Cyclone, 1 Harpies' Feather Duster!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Updated with new cards.,"Basic Combo:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/hQkvdxp938I"">https://youtu.be/hQkvdxp938I</a>  Archetype Strategy:  Ursarctic are not very good, so you have to be sharp, know your deck and know your opponents deck. Ursarctic have two major weaknesses: any interruption and resource cost. The basic Ursarctic combo can be stopped with any hand-trap, so to mitigate the loss, we are running a going first build with traps. If your Ursarctic combo gets interrupted falling back on a <em>Solemn Judgement</em> can sometimes give you an extra turn. To recover our lost resources we must focus on cards that either give us additional card advantage or remove opponents card advantage. <em>Crystal Girl</em> can give you two searches and two bodies, making it a potential +3. <em>Ice Dragon's Prison</em> can banish a monster from your opponents GY and field, and if timed correctly to a <em>Monster Reborn</em>-like effect can be a potential -3 for the opponent.  Ursarctic specialize in high-level hand-trap monsters, they synergize with cards like <em>Fantastical Dragon, Phantazmay</em>; <em>Nibiru, the Primal Being</em>; or LV7 Kaiju which normally require a specific condition for high reward, but without that condition become dead cards in the hand. Ursarctic work around this by using them as fodder, so even if your opponent is not using Link monsters you can discard the <em>Fantastical Dragon, Phantazmay</em> to summon an Ursarctic instead and use their interruptions.  This build is designed to go first, but they can very easily switch to a going second build by swapping out your traps for high-level hand-trap monsters. I would argue that this archetype is supposed to go second with this strategy, however a last minute <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em> can completely wipe your board, losing you your advantage and the game. This archetype has no out to tower monsters like <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em>; you will have to play smart and make sure you run outs like Kaiju; <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>; or <em>Dark Ruler No More</em>.  This deck has a decent chance of winning against other rogue decks, but almost always loses against the meta. To win against a meta deck you really have to know when and where to strike your opponent, adapt your side deck to counter the current meta and abuse their weaknesses.  With the new support card <em>Ursarctic Radiation,</em> you can stomp out your opponent with seven draws! This card fixes all the decks issues... <strong>if you open with it</strong>. Since Ursarctic do not have an easy way to search this card trying to rely on it is not the best strategy. I believe this card simply replaces <em>Pinpoint Landing</em> as an archetype upgraded version and that's about it. You may think that running three would make the most sense and while yes it does improve your odds of opening with it, drawing two of this card or top decking it in a long game can lose you that game. I think two is a better ratio, but if you really want to try it I might suggest removing <em>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</em> for the third copy.  Hints:  Ursarctic effects lock you out of Xyz and Link monsters for the rest of the turn, however you can walk around this restriction by summoning your Ursarctic on your opponents turn. Just make sure that your opponent doesn't have any destruction on board or else you could lose those bodies.  <em>Crystal Girl</em> is a LV1 that can special summon itself from the GY while you control a water monster, combining with your LV8 Ursartic tuner to make a very easy LV9 synchro engine. <em>Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen</em> effect can constantly recover <em>Crystal Girl</em> from the banished zone for a LV9 synchro every turn.  <em>Ursarctic Septentrion</em> negates any monster effect on the field that does not have a level (Links and Xyz), however monsters like <em>Linkuriboh</em> or <em>Crystron Halqifibrax</em> leave the field as cost so their effects will not be negated by <em>Ursarctic Septentrion</em>.  <em>Ursarctic Quint Charge</em> can summon the fusion. Probably the most underrated card in the archetype, Quint Charge is extremely important for regenerating your resources and enabling <em>Ursarctic Grand Chariot</em> to destroy two cards on your opponents turn.  Ursarctic activate twice, once in hand and once on field, making it easy to fulfil <em>Stellar Wind Wolfrayet</em> five monster effect condition.  <em>Melffy Catty</em> can be used to search any LV7 Ursarctic or <em>Hop Ear Squadron</em> on your opponent's turn.

You want to get at least Serziel equipped with Selene, while you can use Branded cards for little combos or Albion to get some resource/recovery in the GY. You can also summon Albion if you want to use it for Evil Eye Empress but remember to do summon any of non-Fusion monster from the Extra before using Branded Opening that is used to summon Jester and use his effect. The Discard target should be Despian Tragedy to usually get the Branded in Red or Jubilation. Dramaturgia is a good material for Fusion Summoning so that you can summon her again and make Number 38 with Albion or keep it as a monster's effect negation.  If you go second you may have problem against boards with many negates, hope to have Kaiju and Impermanence or change with the Side Deck. However you can get advantage from your opponent having monsters on their board Special Summoning Ecclesia and another level 4 to summon Evilswarm to do some cleaning or go for other combos.  Not much to say for the Evil Eye part... Try to have in hand at least Serziel or Domain/Terraforming so you can have the basic kit. As written before, you want to discard Catoblepas from Deck so you can summon it and protect Selene or keep it as a recovery. Usually you summon him if you can summon the Empress to protect Selene. If your opponent doesn't have an out for spells you can just summon him to make the Ruler and then equip Selene. Remember that Ruler wants only Evil Eye monsters, so use the non-Evil Eye to summon Empress.  P.S. : Someone may think Nibiru is better than Sphere... But I like Balls."

It's for you.,"<em><strong>*Kaiju:</strong></em> Help you for: + Anti-Meta: Tribute their very powerful monsters like Dragoon, Divine Arsenal, or something else that you should Tribute them. + Fusion materials: Kaiju has all of the Attributes (LIGHT, DARK, FIRE, WATER, EARTH, WIND) for Fusion summon any Shaddoll and Invoked monsters. <em><strong>*Invoked:</strong></em> Help you to win. Invoked Mechaba to negate your opponent’s combos. For Fusion Summoned Invoked Purgatrio, you can also use Invocation and banish Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring from your GY. Raidjin can make your opponent out of Synchro, Xyz or Link Summoned by change a monster to face-down Defense Position. Also, you can use Invocation to Summon “Shaddoll” monsters. <em><strong>*Shaddoll:</strong> </em>Winda is very, very powerful. It lock-down almost of currently Meta now. Construct will say goodbye to Borrelsword (your opponent control). Grysta and Shekhinaga are also very good. <em><strong>*Handtraps and Traps:</strong></em> Negate your opponent’s combos. It’s very useful and so important for any Deck. <strong>- About Weaknesses:</strong> + Scared about hand-traps when activated “Shaddoll Fusion” without “Magical Meltdown”. + Extra Deck will be trashed when you cannot Special Summoned or negated their effects. + Low ATK. Although “Aleister the Invoker” makes them gain 1000 ATK, its ATK is also low. AT ALL, this Deck is POWERFUL (I think) xD."

End boards can include the familiar simorgh and Apex Avian/Barrier Statue Lock, a 3 material Apollousa, Naturia Beast, 4 material  AA-zeus, set revolt for shuraig.  This deck is also very capable of OTK'ing with ""Accesscode talker"".  Note: I will sometimes refer to Tri-brigade as TB  <hr />  &nbsp;  Starters:  Tenki/Fraktall --- send kit to GY --- send Nervall --- add any TB but ideally Kerass --- summon Kerass --- effect kerass banish 2 to SS ferrijet --- ""Ferrijet"" effect to summon from hand --- if you summoned a TB from hand you can link summon ""Kerass"" and ""Ferrijet"" to make ""Bearbrumm"" use the TB you summoned from hand to summon any link 2 from Extra deck and then link all of them to make 3 material ""Apollousa"" (She will be your 5th  summon), then Bearbrumm can search ""Revolt"" from the deck and set so you can summon ""Shuraij"" during opponent's turn.  Rescue cat v1 --- Summon rescue cat tribute rescue to summon ""TB Kerass"" and ""TB Kit"" rank both into centaurea and attack --- MP2 summon Downerd then you can make a 4 material Zeus  Rescue cat v2 --- Summon rescue cat tribute rescue to summon ""Valerifawn"" and ""PeroPero"" synchro into Naturia Beast against spell heavy decks  If you don't open any of the above starters, but you open  ""TB Nervall"" and/or ""TB Kit"" you can Normal summon on of them to Link into almiraj and activate their GY effect, this will unbrick your hand to search for ""Kerass"" and make some plays at the cost of your Normal Summon.  Even though this is a pure variant, we don't play any of the Tri-brigade spell and traps except for ""Revolt"" and it is only viable because you can guarantee search it with BearBrumm, the others are not that good and we play more hand traps and staples instead. Also the ratios of all the cards are adjustable, but all of them are viable options that have been tested.  <hr />  NOTES &amp; TIPS  -Since rescue cat is a beast it can be SS from the hand by ""Ferrijet"" and searched by ""Shuraij"" when it leaves the field  -Rescue cat tributes as cost, if they try to negate it by hand trap you can activate PSY-frame Gamma or Called by the grave, this is also useful when activating ""Fraktall"" from hand  -""Forbidden Droplet"" is an excellent card to dodge infinite impermanence  when your TB monsters try activate their effects to SS a link monster  -Take note when you link ""Bearrumm"" away and activate its effect, you can't Special Summon except Tri-brigade monsters.  -Valerifawn and peropero are mainly seen as garnets that you can summon off of rescue cat or discard fodder for ""Kerass"", but both of them have decent effects on their own, ""Valerifawn"" can SS ""Kit""or ""Kerass"" from GY and ""Peropero"" can punish from the GY.  -Sky Cavalry Centaurea can bounce problem cards from the field by attacking into to them and activating its effect, this way you won't be able to make a 4 material zeus, but keep in mind it is Beast-Warrior and you can link it  -You may be tempted to activate Triple Tactic Talents to draw 2 cards, but as a link centered deck, it may be more advantageous to take one of your opponents monster if you have at least 1 monster on boards and link them away for Accesscode or Apollousa or a Knightmare monster.  -This deck is not perfect, but it is very strong going both first and second, the extra deck and side deck can be adjusted to fit your playstyle as this deck is very flexible as seen in its popular usage as an engine in other Beast, Winged Beast, Beast Warrior Decks.  <hr />  &nbsp;"

So I tried to revieve the good old Orcust and here`s a way to play it consistenly.  As long as we havn`t got harp horror back, I decided to add a Phantom Knight engine. The main Problem of drawing Orcust monsters is, that they stay in hand unless you have Orcustrated return. So it`s a good idea to play cards like Forbidden Droplet or Twin Twister in the Side Deck when going second. Then, Torn Scales was released in Phantom Rage. Orcust players often decide to play the Rusty-combo in past, but now the Deck have a new Combo starter. Torn Scales also discards as cost for sending a Phantom Knight to the grave, so it often help to come in the Orcust Combo.  I also run 3 copies of Shade Brigandine, because I made good experiences while playing the deck more Combo-oriented. It makes easier to outplay interruptions, but you can cut it to 1 if you want. Another spice card ist Break Sword. This card can help going second a lot, one Torn Scales is at least a Destroy 1 + 2 link materiels and a discard.  All in all, i found a new way to play a competitve Orcust, while waiting on Harp Horror`s return. Have fun!"

I will explain my card choices below. You can choose whatever hand traps and side deck cards you want.</span>  <span>Main Deck</span>  2x Parallel eXceed - Pretty much just a free Abyss Dweller  <span>3x Prank-Kids Rocksies - One of 4 starters, if you get any of them it's pretty hard to brick. You can use this one to unbrick your hand a bit. Because this one isn't used to make Prank-Kids Battle Butler, usually try to use this one first</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Lampsies - One of 4 starters. The burn doesn't really matter, but it's still a good card and very important to the deck</span>  <span>3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - Just a good hand trap, pretty standard</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Dropsies - One of 4 starters. The life points don't really matter, but it’s still important. It can also be used to make toadally awesome, if that happens to be viable</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Fansies - One of the 4 starters. Use it to dump Prank-Kids Plan. Probably the worst of the bunch, but it's searchable by One for One and Thunder Dragon Fusion</span>  <span>2x Effect Veiler - A good hand trap. Infinite Impermanence is better, fight me</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Pranks - Pretty good for recovery, and a free token if necessary. I'm only playing one because it's searchable and not as good as other cards</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Place - Searches one of your starters, the other effect doesn’t really matter</span>  <span>3x Fusion Sage - Searches Polymerization</span>  <span>1x Instant Fusion - Free Prank-Kids Rocket Ride. If it didn’t summon an engine card, I probably wouldn't play it. Rocket Ride is good tho</span>  <span>1x One for One - Free starter, without even using a normal summon</span>  <span>3x Polymerization - Basically the only way to get 3 Prank-Kids Battle Butlers, which is why I play six. If you draw one, use Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo’s effect to send your starters back to your hand, then use Polymerization, and then summon Predaplant Verte Anaconda and use its effect to send Thunder Dragon Fusion to grave. Boom, three board wipes</span>  <span>1x Terraforming - Searches a card that searches a starter</span>  <span>1x Thunder Dragon Fusion - A Polymerization for cards in your graveyard and field. Usually used with Predaplant Verte Anaconda, but not bad in hand</span>  <span>1x Upstart Goblin - 39 card decks are good</span>  <span>1x Called by the Grave - Can be used as anti hand trap, or as a set interruption</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Pandemonium - A quick effect Polymerization. I only play one because it locks you into prank kids and it's searchable. Not my favorite card, but occasionally useful</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Plan - Just a recycler to dump with Prank-Kids Fansies. Doesn’t do anything on field, so probably just discard with Prank-Kids Place</span>  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence - A good hand trap, better than Effect Veiler in my correct opinion</span>  <span>Extra Deck</span>  <span>2x Prank-Kids Battle Butler - The prioritized endboard card for the deck. Board wipes are pretty insane</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Rocket Ride - Can be used to summon back starters from the grave</span>  1x Abyss Dweller - Basically a walking floodgate, and you can get one for free with Parallel eXceed  <span>1x Toadally Awesome - An extra negate, but make sure you prioritize Prank-Kids Battle Butlers</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Rip-Roarin-Roaster - A Harpie’s Feather Duster/ beater that’s easy to summon</span>  <span>1x Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior - Pretty much just there for Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon or I:P Masquerena’d Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax removal</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo - All effects are really useful here, and it activates your starters. It searches a Prank-Kids spell or trap. It can also add two starters from your grave to your hand</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu - Activates your starters, and also adds another board wipe as long as it’s in grave</span>  <span>1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda - Use it to send Thunder Dragon Fusion to grave to summon a Prank-Kids Battle Butler at the end of your combo</span>  <span>1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess - Some extra negates, just make sure you prioritize Prank-Kids Battle Butlers</span>  <span>I hope you enjoy!</span>"
