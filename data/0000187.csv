","A version of Dragon Link with a more significant emphasis on Dragonmaids.

&nbsp;

Why Should I play this deck?

They hit two of Yu-Gi-Oh's most popular archetype, Dragons and Waifus.

Archetype gimmicks turns battle phase into crazy advantage. Its cards are also all good.

Dragonmaid Tidying is a very good card.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How to play:

Turn 1: Try to make Hieratic Seal. Then look to set up Tidying, and depending on the hand, you can either make Borreload Savage or Dragonmaid Sheou.

Turn 2: Try not to die. If they tried to enter battle phase to force seal, tribute seal in battle phase. Consider whether you need to use Tidying's removal on your turn against multiple backrow or as a extender.

Turn 3+: Don't tried to force a OTK, use the battle phase to bounce the Dragonmaids to hand and make Seal, Sheou, or Tidying, or all of them.

&nbsp;

Card Explanation:

Noctovision Dragon: There are several version of decks where its cut down to 1. Maybe it bricks, but the deck is slow enough that drawing two isn't a death sentence, and it can also be used as fusion material for Dragonmaid Sheou. It is a crazy card that protect your backrow.

Dragonmaid Nudyarl: The other option is Dragonmaid Ernus, which special a Dragonmaid from hand. I don't feel the need for the extra summons, and the slow D.D. Crow can be useful.

Dragonmaid Hospitality: It bricks at 3. :) You can cut it down to one, but I run two because I do use the second one.

Rokket Recharger: Honestly, I haven't think too much about the Rokket card. Its a target for Rokket Tracer that isnt too bad when you draw it.

World Legacy Guardragon: Broken card, I once move Dragonmaid Sheou across the board 2 times. Its a reborn that enables Pisty. Its better than hospitality because it can target Rokket cards.

Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay: Its bad for some matchup, but just use it as a fusion material.

Dragonmaid Sheou/ House Dragonmaid: Sheou needs a House Dragonmaid to negate, and it comes up.

Halqifibrax: Ash is the only target, I haven't really tested other targets, but Rokket Synchron is target to replace with Upstart Goblin.

<strong>Other Strategies:</strong>

Your next strategy after Quintet should be to get DM Dragon Knight along with Eternal Soul and Circle with Apprentice acting as your Honest ATK boost. You can get to DM Dragon Knight using Keeper to search Poly, next using Keeper 2nd effect to sp summon DM from grave, and then using poly on DM + Keeper to get DM Dragon Knight. Keeper can also search Fusion Deploy and Magicalized Fusion should you need that. Aside from that, other ways to summon Dragon Knight are:

Phantazmay + DM with Secrets or Poly

DM + Imduk with Secrets or Poly

DM + enemy Dragon using Super Poly

DM + Eye of Timaeus

<strong>Notes:</strong>

There are other ways to 1-turn turbo Quintet with this deck but they may require 1 more necessary card. The listed combos are the least resource intensive.

Should you be wary of hand traps/negates, I suggest you bait them out with your other starting cards first or use Apprentice next since her effect isn't necessary to pull off the combo anyway."

<ul>
 	<li>If you open with a Trap Card (usually Joker's Wild or Trap Trick) you can make Isolde, send 4 Equip Spells to summon Makyura the Destructor, then Link away Makyura to trigger its effect. Then you can activate Joker's Wild on your first turn (or Trap Trick which searches Joker's Wild and lets you activate it the same turn). Joker's Wild can send Face Card Fusion or Joker's Straight, depending which one you need at that moment. If it sends Joker's Straight you can retrieve both it and Joker's Wild at End Phase.</li>
 	<li>Isolde can search Kaiki the Unity Star to your hand upon its Link Summon.  If you have Face Card Fusion (or if you can activate Joker's Wild due to Makyura the Destructor's effect and resolve Face Card Fusion that way) while you control Jack/Queen/King's Knight, you can send Arcana Triumph Joker from your Deck to the GY and Kaiki the Unity Star from your hand to the GY to summon Idaten the Conqueror Star, which searches Joker's Knight on summon. Afterward if you use Joker's Straight, you can easily revive Arcana Triumph Joker.</li>
 	<li>Isolde can send Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade as one of its 4 Equip Spells required to summon Makyura the Destructor. This can be retrieved easily and used for discard costs for Joker's Straight, Idaten the Conqueror Star, Arcana Triumph Joker (when destroying Spell Cards), or can be used to power up Arcana Triumph Joker by keeping it in your hand. This card plus the three self-retrieving Joker cards give Arcana Triumph Joker a minimum of 2000 ATK.</li>
 	<li>Kaiki the Unity Star can revive on the opponent's turn if you control a Level 5 or higher Warrior whose current ATK is different from its original ATK. This can be achieved by controlling Arcana Triumph Joker with 1 card minimum in either player's hand (since its effect says it gains ATK, its original ATK is 0), or discarding a card using Idaten the Conqueror Star's effect to allow it to gain ATK, or by equipping Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade or Sword of Deep-Seated to a Level 5 or higher Warrior of your choice. Once Kaiki the Unity Star summons itself, it can initiate a Fusion Summon using itself and Idaten the Conqueror Star as materials to make Shura the Combat Star, or Gilti-Gearfriend the Magical Steel Knight using itself and another Warrior with a different attribute. Shura allows you to make all monsters the opponent controls have 0 ATK during the Battle Phase, while Gilti-Gearfried can negate effects that target it and gains ATK equal to its DEF if you banish a Spell while battling an opponent's monster. It can also attack twice if it was summoned using only materials on the field.</li>
 	<li>The rest of the Extra Deck not mentioned so far is currently in testing and may be subject to change. Feel free to use different cards in those slots. Number 39: Utopia Double is a possible inclusion to secure a quick OTK.</li>
 	<li>A common first turn end board consists of Arcana Extra Joker (summoned using Isolde, Makyura and a third card), Arcana Triumph Joker, and Idaten, with the ability to revive Kaiki to summon Shura on the opponent's turn.

(and make your opponent suffer a bit)",A simple rank 4 engine that uses Time Thief redoer as a boss to steal cards when the opponent draws or are on the field with XYZ import. Silent Honor Ark does the same with special summoned monster so you can be double stealing your opponent. Eater of Millions forces some kind of different removal so it is a failsafe of the deck when you need to stall a bit for combo pieces. The dreadnough are optional and only there to make 15 card extra deck in case of needing to banish with Millions

Have Alpha and Zeta in your hand as much as possible to pull of the combo (just search the combo online hahaha), summon Herald of Ultimateness and have 2-4 fairy type monsters in your hand using Eva's effect via Beatrice (if you don't have Eva in your hand), and summon Masquerena to link summon either Apollousa or Unicorn during the opponent's turn. I put Borreload Savage for additional negates and OTK. I'm not really sure on my side deck, forgive me if it sucks. I tested the deck and theoretically, it can make up to 12 negates/interruptions. I'm not really good in making decks though."

Your Amazoness archetype is the meat of the deck, working as your frontline to bait enemy effects and build a wall of offense while you have The A. Forces active. Their 1100-1500 statline makes them easy to search off of Rat, WLotW, and Last Will, giving you constant field presence with the exception of Paladin, who requires a search off of RotA. Paladin and Tiger are your primary battlers especially while you have one or both The A. Forces active. Chain Master is best to employ early in the duel, as her effect allows you to steal an opponent's monster from their hand, potentially denying them of a valuable resource, at the cost of 1500 Life Points. Finally, Swordswoman is a sneaky option to deal consistent damage to your opponent in battle while protecting your life points. They are supported by several other EARTH and staple monsters depending on the situation you find yourself in. Granmarg is the goon of the deck, removing what is hopefully a critical set card and giving you access to a 2400 body, while Injection Fairy Lily is the deck's back-up win condition, and is searchable by almost any option at your disposal for a surprise attack. Legendary Jujitsu Master serves as your primary wall, forcing opposing attackers to bounce back to the top of the deck to give you some breathing room. Giant Rats and Warrior Lady of the Wasteland serve as your recruiters, and although WLotW may seem like a worse fill-in for a third Giant Rat, her Warrior typing allows her to benefit from the A. Forces where Rat does not, giving you the extra ATK boost you might need. Finally, some staples you see in every deck of the era: Breaker, MoF, Mask and Sangan, who need no explanation.

The predominant trap of this deck is Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane, which I find to be a criminally underrated tool for EARTH decks. With the exception of Granmarg and your non-EARTH monsters, Kurogane allows you to pull anything in your GY back to your field at a moment's notice, allowing surprise tag-ins with the resources you've accumulated over the course of the duel, and any of your monsters can be relied on depending on the state of the field. Even better, Kurogane can swap a monster that has already attacked in your battle phase for a fresh monster for an additional attack that might just win you the duel. For the same reason, this deck has a method to summon or swap monsters from any location: Last Will and your recruiters can call from the Deck, Dramatic Rescue enables your Amazonesses to switch with a monster in the hand, and Interdimensional Matter Transporter lets you turn any of your monsters into a one-turn Strike Ninja to evade almost anything your opponent has in store for them, and Kurogane and Call of the Haunted obviously access your Graveyard. Other than the staple Spell/Traps, Amazoness Spellcaster allows you trade ATK values with an opponent's monster to potentially go over something troublesome such as the ever-present Cyber Dragon and Monarchs.

In the Side Deck, Millennium Shield exists specifically to counter Skill Drain decks as that trap card is a hazard to this effect-heavy deck. As an EARTH Warrior monster, it is very searchable and triggers the A. Forces, giving it more utility than something like Labyrinth Wall. D.D. Warrior Lady is only here due to not being EARTH, making her less useful in the main deck. Amazoness Blowpiper and Amazoness Archers are available in case your opponent's attacking monsters are just a little too out of reach of your A. Forces boosts. Scapegoat is also important to be mindful of. It's not in the main deck due to the need for open field spaces in case your opponent is vulnerable to an A. Forces Amazoness beatdown, but as the tokens are EARTH, you can trade them with Kurogane for anything in your GY for free, in case you do decide to side the card in.

I find this deck's strength to be in its ability to tempo out an opponent with your constant tag-ins, switches and self-banishes. By retaining and trading field advantage and forcing your opponent's removal effects to be wasted, you can consistently drain your opponent of their options while chipping away at their life points. There are certainly options to consider adding that I chose not to that could boost this deck's efficiency. I believe EARTH monsters like Berserk Gorilla can be useful to drag out of the GY with Kurogane, and obviously this deck chooses to avoid the two biggest Warrior Toolbox monsters of Marauding Captain and D.D. Assailant for the sake of Amazoness Consistency, but so far this build has worked well as it is, even if it remains a work in progress.

The major weaknesses to look out for: Skill Drain as I mentioned, as this is a very monster effect-reliant deck. Jinzo and other anti-trap cards are also something you need to take into account, as losing your surprise switches and stranding your monsters will deprive you of the field presence you need to keep pressure on your opponent. Similarly if your opponent is invested on banishing your cards, it will cut you off from valuable options to tag into when you need them. While I haven't had cause to add it to the side deck, you should consider a copy of Return to be able to recover from an opponent's deck that features a lot of banishment.

Women that are born from a plant's flowers during the winter. their original form is a single petal, but as they grow past their infancy, they begin to resemble human girls. They also tend to be fashionable and trendy. for their unusual biology they are referred to as Fairies while their leaders are called Queens.

While they often mingle with the outside world, their cultural quirks indicate that they are more comfortable in colder climates, and that they tend to feel drowsy in warmer climes. Scholars speculate that they evolved from sentient fauna that aestivates during the summer. the hypothesis has some evidence as the gardens where the Rikka gather and are born from bloom in the winter.

Furthermore they are also more capable of survival in subzero temperatures than humans are, but aren't completely immune to freezing. In fact there were some incidents where some of them froze solid and stayed frozen even as the temperature reached 30 degrees Celsius.""

A Rikka deck that with some Rose cards as techs. The strategy of the archetype revolves around tributing your mosnters and your opponents mosnters for advantage. As well as access a toolbox of Xyz monsters via the level modification effects of the Rikka Fairies.

<a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop</a> is the best playmaker of the deck as her ability allows you to make every plant monster have the same level as one of them and she can summon herself and another plant form your hand at the cost of not being able to summon non-Plants that turn. <a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula</a> is second as her effect raises the levels of two Plants by two and she can summon herself if a monster if tributed. In between them is <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan</a>, who can add one of the archtype's backrow to your hand form your deck. Note that these monsters are statistically defense-oriented. I run each at 3.

The Fairies come in pairs, with one of them having high DEF and the other having High ATK but more situational effects, as well as an effect to revive themselves under specific circunstances. Of the attack-oriented ones, <a data-name=""Cyclamen the Rikka Fairy"">Cyclamen</a> is the most situational, foe her effect is the opposite of Primulas and it work by tributing her form the hand. <a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica</a> has an effect that works like <a data-name=""Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow"">Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow</a>, boosting the stats of a battling Rikka monster by a set amount by tributing her form the hand or field. <a data-name=""Hellebore the Rikka Fairy"">Hellebore</a> is a handtrap of sorts, stopping opponents effect as long as they target and you have a Rikka onboard. I run 2 of each.

&nbsp;

For each pair of fairies there is a queen. The Queens are Xyz monsters that serve as the bosses of the deck. <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop</a> being their primary boss, allowing you to tribute any monster and do it during the opponent's turn if she has a Plant as an overlay unit and gains ATK with each tribute. <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi</a> is an analogue of sort so to <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. In that they allow you to take an opponents monster. However Kanziashi needs a monster to be tributed first and she affects monsters on the field, also changing them to Plants. Het other effect lets you tribute a plant to take the deathblow an an opponent's effect. Last but not least is <a data-name=""Rikka Queen Strenna"">Strenna</a>. An adorbale little scater that can recover backrow form the GY and if she is tributed while haivng material lets you bring forht a bigger plant with herself as their overlay unit. This means you can get out monsters like <a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a>, and Teardrop without running the right levels. Of course they'll only have one material in that case, but Hyperyton can get more every turn.

The last monster of note is <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a>. She can special summon herself from the GY and also lets you search or mill a Fairy to use their effects. Of course she also plant-locks you, so I can understand if people don't play her as much. I also run 3 <a data-name=""Rikka Glamour"">Rikka Glamour</a> and one each of <a data-name=""Rikka Flurries"">Flurries</a>, <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Sheet</a> and <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Tranquility</a>.

The rose cards I added for the main deck are <a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Witch"">Ruddy Rose Witch</a>, <a data-name=""Witch of the Black Rose"">Witch of the Black Rose</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Fairy"">Rose Fairy</a> and <a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a>. This is a small-ish engine that lets you pull off a <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> or other plays involving <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Garden Rose Flora"">Garden Rose Flora</a>.

Other monsters include <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, <a data-name=""Evil Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a>, <a data-name=""Staysailor Romarin"">Staysailor Romarin</a>, <a data-name=""Tytannial, Princess of Camellias"">Tytannial, Princess of Camellias</a>, and of course Plant Staple <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a>. For the Extra Deck, besides those already mentioned, I run <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Titanic Galaxy</a>, <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the timeless"">Number 60: Dugares</a>, <a data-name=""Number 87: Queen of the Night"">Number 87: Queen of the Night</a>, <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Sunavalon Dryas</a>, <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and <a data-name=""Marincess Coral Anemone"">Marincess Coral Anemone</a>.

The side deck includes additional copies of Flurries, Sheet and Tranquility and 3 copies of <a data-name=""Rose Lover"">Rose Lover</a>. As placeholders I also have 3 <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> and <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> each.

<a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>: It gives all Amazoness-monsters battle-damage-immunity, and it is easy to special summon it to rush with amazoness-cards and to force the opponent to play negate-cards.

-possible special summons:

1. <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a> (you can not link- or synchro-summon in the same turn)

2. <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a> (if <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a>, <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> gets destroyed)

4. <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> (It gets summoned from the Hand, GY or Deck if it gets destroyed.)

5. <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> (It can be summoned when <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> declares an attack, you can attack monsters with higher atk this way because you can't get destroyed when you attack after the effect, but you will get battle-damage from it, and the effect must work, you also have to discard one card from the hand or the field. Good targets to discard are tokens, <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> (because you get one anyway), or <a data-name=""Swords of revealing Light"">Swords of revealing Light</a> (maybe after 1 or 2 rounds if possible)

-<a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> - A good card to play form the start hand because you can get <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a> with it, if you have another Amazoness-monster-card, you could also get <a data-name=""Amazoness Spy"">Amazoness Spy</a> to special summon it.

<a data-name=""Amazoness Spy"">Amazoness Spy</a> - Can be special summoned to get more monsters on the field, can also be fusion summoned with <a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion</a> to get a fast <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a>

<a data-name=""Amazoness Sage"">Amazoness Sage</a> - Strong with <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> to shoot Spells/Traps while having battle-damage-immunity, can be special summoned by <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a>'s effect, the Amazoness-support cards, and searched by <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a>.

<a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> – A good midgame-card when you have <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> or <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> in the graveyard to special summon them as synchro- or link-material. You can also set it in the earlygame to get a token when it gets destroyed, or link summon with it to get the token directly.

<a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a>: a good early-game card that is cyberse like <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> to get <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> and <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a>. The 'opener-combo' it to play it as the first normal summon, get the token and summon splash mage, then get <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> back with it and summon <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> with only one monster used. You can later fusion summon it fast with only 2 other effect-monsters, that you can link-summon to <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a>, to <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> which has then 4500atk (with link-2 material) for one turn of each player, and a 'wall'-effect that works best with <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> or <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>. You can also special summon it with <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a> from the deck, but you must fusion summon it then directly without link-summons, you still trigger the token-effect, so you could use it as 2 free-tributes for <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, The True Dracombantant"">Metaltron XII, The True Dracombantant</a>. You also trigger the token-effect by special summoning it from the Graveyard with <a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a> or <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>.

<a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion</a>: You can use it to get <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a> with one generic Amazoness-monster. You can not use the tribute-effect to summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> because it its not an earth-monster, but this would be not a good play anyway because you wouldn't get the 'fusion-summoned'-effects. You can still use it as substitude for <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> with <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a>.

<a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a>: A fast token-summoning monster that can be special summoned with <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> from the graveyard and that works in the same turn it gets summoned, so it's good for the earlygame and to rush for link-monsters.

<a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>: a level-1-tuner and a good token monster that also can be special summmoned with <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> from the graveyard. It's good for Tokens and for synchro-summoning, you get <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> with 1 <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> (level 6), then you could revive it to summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> (level 7-synchro). With amazoness cards you always have an <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> on the field so it's a good support for amazoness-monsters, you could also use two level-3 monsters if you want.

draw cards, with amazoness call you always get <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> to then get <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a> or <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a> by summoning it, and also get <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> with the attack-effect, but you can also get all other amazoness cards, but you can not use it twice in a turn. <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</a> is the best draw card with tokens that you need for the link-monster-support anyway, you can not use the effect with normal-monsters but you get tokens from <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a>, <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> and you can also set monsters like <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> (flip effect) and amazoness monsters ('battle-damage'-immunity or <a data-name=""Amazoness Spy"">Amazoness Spy</a>'s GY-summon-effect). <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a> is best with <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> (graveyard-summon-effect) or <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> (you can shoot two monsters instead of one , and it also comes back from the graveyard).

<a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a>, <a data-name=""Fusion Deployment"">Fusion Deployment</a>, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>, <a data-name=""One-Time Passcode"">One-Time Passcode</a>,  <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>:

Good defensive cards for tokens and special summons, with Amazoness cards it's good to rush for fast wall-effects, with <a data-name=""Swords of revealing light"">Swords of revealing light</a> the opponent has to decide between it, <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a> and <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a> with negate-cards, so it's also good because it gets 'aggro' and the opponent hast to negate it, you can also discard it with <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a>'s attack-effect. <a data-name=""One-time Passcode"">One-time Passcode</a> can be used for fast Cyberse-link-monsters whenever you have it or as a tribute for <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> or <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant.</a>

&nbsp;

Traps:

<a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a> – With it you get a 'wall' as fast as possible by special summoning <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> with it, this protects the other amazoness-combo's. You can also use it to summon <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant</a> with only one tribute and then get a good 'boss-monster' that negates the opponent cards.

<a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> – good special summon, If you special summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> with it you can search for another Amazoness card from the deck, and if you summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>, your Amazoness-monster-cards get undestroyable, if you summon <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> you get a token.

<a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> - fusion-trap that works good with amazoness cards, amazoness princess's name is in the graveyard also 'amazoness queen, and you cana also use <a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion</a> as material from the graveyard, you can also fusion summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> fast with it<a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">.</a>

<a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a>: Amazoness-support card, special summons one amazoness-monster per battle phase fro the hand with +500atk in that battle phase and opponent monsters get banished everytime they fight amazoness-monsters, so the opponent has to clear it especially if you have 'battle-damage'-immunity, it works more than one time, so with <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a> you could even attack all opponent monsters with <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> and banish them. If it gets destroyed you get one amazoness-monster special summoned from the graveyard.

<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> – good negate that works twice

&nbsp;

Extra-deck:

Fusion:

<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> – the '<a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>'-target, 'eats' one monster and can then be used for <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>

<a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> – you get 4500atk when you used Link 2 - <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> to summon it, for one turn of each player, if you have another link-monster on the field you get a wall-effect that gives target- and attack-immunities to other monsters. You get a spell from the deck if it gets sent to the graveyard by an opponent's card effect (not by battle).

<a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a>, <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a> - High Atk Monsters with good effects that can attack all other monsters with <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a> in the GY. <a data-name=""Amazoness Empress"">Amazoness Empress</a> is only good with <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>, so that both have 'battle-damage'-immunity, then it gets even stronger with more wall-cards. The 'wall'-monsters that you can play are <a data-name=""Amazoness Pet Liger"">Amazoness Pet Liger</a>, <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>, the other monsters can be used to have more negates and 'boss-monsters'.

<a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>: Good 'wall'-monster with Amazoness Cards that can be special summoned with one <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>. The opponent has to attack and to target it first,and it won't get destroyed by battle, so it can defeat any monster in battle that has 3000 or less atk.

&nbsp;

Link:

<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: You can use the tokens from <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a>, <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> and <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> or <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> and <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> as level-1-monsters.

<a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a>: It's only used to get more monsters for link summons on the field. You can get <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> with only one <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a>, but you can also use it to get a fast <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, and summon as much Link-monsters as possible before it to destroy more cards with it. <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> is the only Link-monster that is not Cyberse, so you can not summon it in the same turn after you used the effect, you can also not special summon other monsters after you used it, if they are not cyberse, so you have to special summon amzoness-monsters or token-monsters before you use it if you want to special summon more monsters. With the effect you can special summon <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> in defense position and with effects negated, but you can't summon link monsters because they can't be in defense position, so you have to calculate that if you summon link-4 monsters.

<a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> – Good alternative to <a data-name=""Necro Fusion"">Necro Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion"">The Earth - Hex-sealed Fusion</a>, when you have enough tokens, but it only needs generic effect monsters. It can also use itself as fusion material if you summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a>.

<a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a>: You can summon it with <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> that you can turn to <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> in one turn. It can shoot 2 monsters instead of one if you use <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a> on it, it is a good 'Wall'-Link-Monster to support <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>, because both need a link monster for their 'wall'-effects.

<a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>: The best Link-monster that can also be summoned very fast in the earlygame if you have a token card. You can then special summon <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> if possible to have more Link-monsters in the graveyard and then summon it to destroy a card for every link-monster in the graveyard or on the field. You have to banish them but you can destroy 3-4 cards in one turn, and then have a monster with at least 4300 atk. This can counter most boss-monsters of other deck-combo's if they don't have any negates to stop the summon or destroy-effect. It can also banish itself to destroy another card if you don't need the atk-damage. If you can summon <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> before you get it, you only need another level-1-Token or 1 Monster, and you already have 5300 atk then. This is nearly as strong as <a data-name=""Red-eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-eyes Dark Dragoon</a> was before it got banned, but it does not have the negate power against the otk- and early-lockdown-strategies that are most important to counter somehow if it's possible, it also cannot be summoned with only one spell and it's harder to summon it in the first turn.

<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> – You have to summon with 4 materials to be effective, then you can draw 4 cards and put 3 back into the deck, to then easily play the right amazoness-combo's with also one more card in the hand. It depends if you have enough tokens and other monsters to play, if it's an effective play, then you can also use the special summon effect to summon one monster from the hand, so it can be fast worth it to summon it. It's also Link-4, so if you have it in the graveyard when you have Accesscode Talker you get 6300atk with it.

&nbsp;

Synchro:

<a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>: You can summon it with <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> and <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> (level 6) or for example with two level-3 monsters instead. It can knock-out all extra-monsters by sending them back to the extra-deck without targeting them. It has to be attacked and targeted when you have another link-monster. It is also possible to summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> with another <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>.

<a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> – One of the targets that are good to summon with <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant</a>. It would be normally harder to summon it in one turn, and it has a good monster-effect negate, and it's also hard to defeat it in a battle.

<a data-name=""Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a> – One of the targets that are good to summon with <a data-name=""Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant"">Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant</a>. It would be normally harder to summon it in one turn, and it has a good Spell/trap-negate, you get <a data-name=""Clock Wyvern"">Clock Wyvern</a> as a wind-monster from the deck to the hand if it gets sent to the graveyard by an opponents card."

Like the last two entries, I enjoyed reading the feedback about them. especially the huge majority of people talking about the quantity of Maxx “C” that they were uncomfortable with, and occasional snark remarks about the region as well. Unfortunately, KONAMI has not yet decided Maxx “C” is problematic in the OCG. So my dear TCG readers, I apologize for the distress this may cause you for the next three months.

This article, as per namesake, is about me breaking down the Limit Regulations for the next three months. I will do my best to explain various reasonings behind certain factors with the current metagame in mind.

As a final disclaimer, this is about the OCG July 2021 Ban List. Several cards like Maxx “C” and Sky Striker Mobilize – Engage are not banned, and some cards that “have not been imported” like Decode Talker Heatsoul exist in this metagame."

An attempt at running Aromages as pure as possible, so not just a plant link/synchro deck. Spooky Dogwood as a handtrap can let you gain ridiculous life points against combo decks, and cauldron of the old man is probably the most usable LP gain card.

You want to try and get Link-2 Jasmine pointing to Sweet Marjoram on turn 1 (example of this are in the video), which searched Blessed Winds so that you can heal on demand and search / pop a card at the same time, and then revive Marjoram if she gets destroyed.

(Remade this because the previous version get tagged as ""burn"" and ""rose dragon"" when neither of those tags are relevant, and won't tag it with ""aromage"" for some reason)"

You can absolutely summon the three knights up to 3 times in one single turn with your best hand, and even if you don't, Joker's Straight not only makes you summon the three knights, but also gives you an extra normal summon, which you can use to get another set of knights on the field, or even normal summon an egyptian god. Joker's Straight, Joker's Wild and Joker's Knight are definitely the best of this deck, always recycling at the end of either player's turn. Which allows you to play them every single turn.

With Thunderspeed Summon you can normal summon Slifer (even from the deck) or Ra, at the beginning of your turn, during the battle phase (which would allow for a Ra one turn kill) or even during your opponent's turn. (Ra Sphere Mode is also eligible).

Even if you are not capable of ending things with a God, with so many summons of level 4s and 5s, you have access to a lot xzys and link monsters, from Isolde, to Utopia Lightning, Constellar Pleiades and even Zeus in the right stituation.

Court of Card might be a bad second turn card, but it's absolutely useful if you choose to play slifer, or if you brick, which as in any deck, might happen.

Arcana Knight Joker is just a targer for Pot of Prosperity.

Give it a try and make it your own with any changes you may see fit. It has enough hand traps and support to compete in a tournament."

If you want to put Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in, i recommend to take Red-Eyes Wyvern out and put Dark Magician in.

<strong>Summoning:</strong>

Main way of summoning Monsters is to either have Catalyst Field up and summon your Gemini Monsters without a tribute and activating the Ability on the same Turn. Or use Return of the Red-Eyes and get your Monsters from the Graveyard.

Return of Dragon Lords, Red-Eyes Baby Dragon and Red-Eyes Alterantive Dragon also help getting your Red-Eyes on the Field. The later one can get you a Red-Eyes Black Dragon with 4800 ATK.

Red-Eyes Fusion is the the Red-Eyes version of Fusion, most of the Time you want Red-Eyes Slash Dragon or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.

Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon and Darkness Metal, the Dragon of Dark Steel can also help getting your Dragons out.

<strong>Protection:</strong>

Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact are the Main ways protect your Red-Eyes.

Catalyst Field is the main way of getting rid of Spell/Trap Cards and powerfull  Monsters (that are not protected from destruction).

Red-Eyes Fang with Chain can get rid of (most) Boss-Monsters, since it doesn't destroy them. As long as you can target the Monster and the effect is not canceled you can turn the Monster into equiptment.

Return of the Dragon Lords can also prevent the destruction of one of your Dragons.

(Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon can also stop one effect per Turn and destroy up to 2 Monster if put in)

<strong>Getting Cards:</strong>

Red-Eyes Insight, Black Metal Dragon and Red-Eyes Baby Dragon are the main ways of getting Cards you need. Since you need to send Red-Eyes to the Graveyard for Red-Eyes Insight it supports summoning or helps getting the second Gearfried the Red-Eyes Iron Knight into the Graveyard for Red-Eyes Slash Dragon.

If your Galaxy Satellite Dragon can survive till your Opponents End-Phase you can also get a card on the next turn. But Galaxy Satellite Dragon is mainly in this Deck to help summon Darkness Metal."

The onomat + bancho + Dwarf combo follows the same line but first you need to get ascended sage out on the field. You'll normal summon onomat, activate its effect to ss both dwarf and bancho from hand, xyz into utopic sage, then detaching from utopic sage to ss the ascended sage from deck, from there you overlay the sage and whichever of the Lv 4 you have left following the same line of play as the other combo, this combo does have better perks such as the utopic sage being able to protect one of you utopia monster, and also being able to extend further with the effect of dwarf in grave to ss and bancho on field to ss from grave. there are indeed many more ways to do combos in this deck and to be honest it feels like you'r able to freestyle into whichever combo you want. I hope you try out this deck and it shows a side of something interesting to you."

Flundereezenuts","This deck in my opinion is extremely fun and really reminds me of the play-style of PK Fire. But first things first, this deck ""kinda"" solves the problem with flundereeze instantly having to pass after being ashed or imperm, as the simorgh field spell gives you a second normal in some situation and the baby simorgh birbs can sometimes bait a negate, but as it stands, it's still an extremely hard deck to pick up and learn, as your combos really depend on you going first and not drawing a hand full of monsters that require a 1 to 2 tributes to summon, but if you are willing to learn this deck, you will find that a lot of the recent meta decks can't play through Empen, Surprised Raiza and for some really odd reasons, Dark Simorgh.

<hr />

DUMB SYNERGY FILLER :

First, THE SIMORGH FIELD SPELL IS OP AF, HOLY HELL DOES IT HELPS FLUNDEREEZE.

Second, The simorgh birbs triggers the flundereeze's banish effect. (simple enough)

Third, Darkness Simorgh gives flundereeze the option for a negate, but remember you can't special summon the turn you used any of the flundereeze effect. So the main strat with it is to special summon it during your opponent's turn with the effect of the Flundereeze field spell tribute summoning something like Raiza or Empen or you can normal summon it on your turn. Whatever situations suits you.

<hr />

That's all I got to say, but is this deck is hella fun. Really reminds me of PK Fire and really does live up to it's legacy."

The main strategy is to get lair of darkness onto the field and oppress your opponent's side of the field through tributing there monsters. knightmares help with backrow and special summoned monsters negations(gryphon and phoenix).

diabolos are there for both; lair of darkness synergy and dark world dealings to essentially get a free draw.

Blazing mirror force for millennium seeker special summon and burn damage.

Card advance+ draw of fate for setup.

While I listed this as a Fun/Casual Deck that is mainly because I desire to run of each of the colorful weapons and I know that most of them are too ...subpar to contend with the meta as much (the exceptions being<a data-name=""Artifact Scythe""> Scythe</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Lancea</a> and maybe <a data-name=""Artifact Chakram"">Chakram</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Dagda</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Durandal"">Durandal</a> and<a data-name=""Artifact Moralltach""> Moralltach</a>).

Regardless I do have a idea on where to take this deck and a desire to seek out feedback on what else can be done to improve this deck apart form removing most of the artifacts. Ahem the general gist is to use the Holes and Artifacts in tandem to but advantage and bait the opponent into destroying my backrow, which will in turn set up for Rank 5 plays the next turn. To that end I'm running <a data-name=""Chronomaly Vimana"">Vimana</a> (once Dawn of Majesty releases that is) and <a data-name=""Number 33: Chornomaly Machu Mech"">Machu Mech</a> as a First and Second turn play as well as <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> to pop my own backrow if needed (granted they're there as placeholders until better options come to mind and are better utilized with Vajra or Beagalltach). the rest of the monsters are Traptrixes as well as <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Dagda</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Durendal"">Durendal</a>. I'm planning on a ratio of 3 <a data-name=""Traptrix Sera"">Sera</a>, 3 <a data-name=""Traptrix Allomerus"">Allomerus</a> 1 <a data-name=""Traptrix Cularia"">Cularia</a> and 1 <a data-name=""Traptrix Rafflesia"">Rafflesia</a>.

I seek feedback for this concept with the following questions
<ul>
 	<li>What Trap Holes should be ran besides Gravedigger's. I'm waiting until the inevitable mega-tin reprint to get those. But I also want to know what other holes are ran alongside that card</li>
 	<li>Are there any cards that recover Banished Traps? They might be useful for later.</li>
 	<li>What other ED monster could be ran in this build besides the obvious (Knightmares, Link-4s, Utopia)? this is mainly to replace the Tornado Dragons.</li>

Call Redoer and company! They'll do stuff! (In depth profile),"<h2>Stolen Utopia: Breakdown</h2>
Howdy! Welcome and thank you for checking out my deck profile! If you bother to read this essay on a children's card game, you will obtain a better understanding of why I made specific card choices, other options for the deck, and some of the optimal end boards.
<h3>The Ideal Utopia(?):</h3>
As the majority of the play base is aware of, ""Utopia"" and it's related cards/archetypes have been receiving copious amounts of support within the last two years, whether it be from Lightning Overdrive, Legendary Duelists: Magical Hero, the new Overlay Network: Structure Deck, or King's Court. No matter where you are getting your support from, as long as it's current, it's bound to be playable.
<h5>Legendary Duelist: Magical Hero:</h5>
First off, I'm not main decking any of the support from this set, but I still figured it'd be worth mentioning how it did give the deck some much needed field presence and searching for said field presence. As I have found, ""Time Thief"" has better interactions with the Lightning Overdrive support versus Magical Hero's ""<a data-name=""Zubababancho Gagagacoat"">Zubababancho Gagagacoat</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Dododowarf Gogogoglove"">Dododowarf Gogogoglove</a>"", but I'll elaborate later.
<h5>Lightning Overdrive:</h5>
This set introduced two new Level 4 ""ZS -"" monsters and ""ZW -"" monsters, along with a ""Utopia"" themed R.U.M. and other ""Zexal"" Spell/Trap support. ""<a data-name=""ZS - Ascended Sage"">ZS - Ascended Sage</a>"" has the inherent Summoning ability that's active while you control no cards. A free body? Yes, exactly, but it gets better with ""<a data-name=""ZS - Armed Sage"">ZS - Armed Sage.</a>"" It too has the ability to inherently Special Summon itself, but only if the only monster you control is a Level 4 monster that's not a copy of itself. These two are great cards, they allow you to get to Rank 4 easily and when used as material for the Xyz Summon of a ""Utopia"" monster, they search for a R.U.M. (Ascended Sage) and a ZW - monster (Armed Sage). As an honorable mention, ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Dragonic Utopia Ray"">Ultimate Dragonic Utopia Ray</a>"" the new retrain of ""<a data-name=""Number C39: Utopia Ray"">Number C39: Utopia Ray,</a>"" is the only TCG legal ""Utopia Ray"" that sees play, but as soon as ""<a data-name=""Leo Utopia Ray"">Leo Utopia Ray</a>"" is available, it'll be the less preferred card. ""<a data-name=""ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber"">ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</a>"" is a Level 5 monster with the ability to Special Summon itself if your LP is 2000 or lower than your opponents. Rarely is it going to be used for Xyz Material, more often you'll be equipping it to a ""Utopia"" monster by a card effect. It has a similar effect to ""<a data-name=""ZW - Eagle Claw"">ZW - Eagle Claw</a>,"" but it negates monster effects on the field instead of Traps. ""<a data-name=""ZW - Dragonic Halberd"">ZW - Dragonic Halberd</a>"" is the second ""ZW -"" introduced. Not much else to say other than it can search ""Zexal"" Spell/Trap cards.

The three playable ""Zexal"" backrow released are ""<a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</a>,"" ""<a data-name=""Zexal Construction"">Zexal Construction</a>,"" and ""<a data-name=""Zexal Entrust"">Zexal Entrust</a>."" ""Construction"" allows you to search ""ZW -,"" ""ZS -,"" other ""Zexal"" Spell/Traps, or ""R.U.M.""/""R.D.M.,"" which is why there is only one ""Entrust."" Speaking of it, ""Entrust"" allows you to revive or recover a ""Utopia,"" ""ZW -,"" or ""ZS -"" monster and during the next turn, if your LP is 2000 or lower than your opponents, you can add one ""Zexal"" Spell/Trap in your GY to your hand. Finally, ""R.U.M. Zexal Force."" It works like most ""R.U.M."" Spells, but it requires the player to summon a ""Utopia"" or ""ZW -"" monster, then you place one ""ZW -"" or ""ZS -"" monster from your Deck on the top of the Deck. (Not optional if the Xyz Summon goes through.) Lastly, it's GY effect. It too revolves around 2000 LP difference, and it lets you draw a card by banishing it.
