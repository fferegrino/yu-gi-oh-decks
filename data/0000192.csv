If you stall successfully, during turn 2 you can go into Leo Dancer using Chick as material which turns off all the opponent's effects when banished (Wolf banishes the materials for its fusion effect) securing you the win. You make Leo by ditching Wolf+Panther with Chick, then making Tiger King searching Black Sheep. Black Sheep re-adds Wolf and then you can fusion summon. Notable cards are Whelp + Destruction Sword. Whelp sends Destruction Sword to the GY, which you can use to pitch either Perfume or Serenade Dance. Destruction Sword then acts as discard fodder for either of the 2. Keep in mind that Perfume can trigger the Dangers but the same cannot be said about Serenade Dance.</p>"

Utopic astral hope makes xyz change tactics searchable giving this deck a powerful draw engine , which can easily lead into a +3-+8 in card advantage.

Utopic Future dragon makes the future archetype viable giving a monster eff negate and potential monster steal.

Utopic sage + Gaga guardian gives this deck two useful non number cards to summon future with.

This deck can easily lead into a board with 2-3 monster negates and multiple 4000+ attack point monsters on a first turn hand.

Running ZW's make this deck prone to bricking so keeping this deck staple light. Dark ruler no more/ Called by the grave are important to stop hand and field negations, and solemn judgement and numbers protect give this deck some much needed omni negates. Harpie's feather duster is for backrow."

Now for the ways that my build differs
<ul>
 	<li>Palladium Oracle Mana</li>
</ul>
The reason I'm playing Mana instead of Magician girl is that mana is and extender in case one of your spellcasters is targeted allowing you to go into verte then dragoon if your opponent is greedy
<ul>
 	<li>2 of hand traps</li>
</ul>
I'm playing the two of hand traps because I get more diversity in my hand trap line up of course I'm still playing 3 ash blossom cause I believe that if you play ash blossom you have to play 3 also it's generic every deck in yugioh is effected by ash blossom.

The Dogmatikas. The bane of any extra deck-focused deck, which, when combined with Shaddolls and Invoked, forms a disgustingly powerful control deck. That's not what we're doing today. Today is all about the deck in its purest form.

The Dogmatikas are all about their crusade against the extra deck, so we'll barely ever use ours. I say barely because Dogmatikas cannot go first on their own. The best you can do is normal summon Ecclesia or Adin and set some traps to live until your next turn. Because of this, we're running Instant Fusion to summon out Millennium-Eyes Restrict which can be linked off into Linkuriboh to fulfil the conditions for every single summon except for Nexus and White Knight. However, Instant Fusion is currently sitting at 1, so you're rarely going to draw it in your opening hand. To fix this glaring issue, you can substitute Retort Fusion and use Kamionwizard to summon Magistus Maiden Artemis instead of the Linkuriboh play. You can also use Darkfire Dragon and summon out Striker Dragon to pretend you're doing a dragon link combo. Just be aware that the TCG doesn't exactly have this card yet, so if you get your hands on a playset of Retort Fusion and use it at an official tournament, you're gonna be disqualified.

So now, we come to the extra deck. As with all Dogmatika builds, you need to be careful about which cards you're dumping from your extra deck throughout your turn. N'tss is a non-OPT pop anything on the field so only send this when you have stuff to pop. Fossil Warrior Skull Knight is your extra copies of N'tss, but it comes with an upside. If you've already popped all the troublesome monsters on your opponent's field, he can just sit in grave until you're ready to use him. The goodest of bois. Titaniklad is pretty self-explanatory. He gives you a free summon from deck in the end phase (or a free search if you'd rather have that), but this effect is a hard OPT so you can't just dump 3 Titaniklad and build a board like that. Wind Pemasus @Ignister strikes fear into your opponent's heart as they constantly fear its effect to shuffl one of their monsters into the deck after they destroy one of yours. And finally, Herald of the Arc Light. Unlike every single synchro deck in recent memory, we only care about its ritual spell/monster search effect. This gets you White Knight who can dump Titaniklad using Dogmatikalamity to summon itself from hand.

Now it's time for the main deck. Most of these cards should be familiar. Ecclesia searches your archetype, Maximus sends 2 cards from both extra decks to grave, Fleurdelis boosts attack when your cards declare attacks and negates a monster's effects if you have another Dogmatika on field, Nadir Servant is the single-most busted search card in the game, and Punishment sends a card from your extra deck to the GY to destroy and opponent's monster as long as the attack is greater than that opponent's monster. As for the cards that you might not know, Adin is a free summon from hand that can float into any Dogmatika from deck (except Nexus and White Knight of course). White Knight lets you send a card from both extra decks to the GY when your opponent activates an effect. Ashiyan summons itself when an extra deck summon is sent to the GY and even adds a Dogmatika from grave back to hand as consolation. Nexus is your win condition. Lightning Storm on attack declaration and burns if it killed any extra deck monsters by the effect. Not to mention its amazing summon condition that lets you empty your opponents GY of extra deck monsters to summon itself.

As for spell cards, Called By is for handtrap insurance, Dwimmered Path adds any Dogmatika from GY to hand, Dogmatika Nation provides some protection to your Dogmatikas, and Dogmatikacism gives you some way to lower an opponent's monster's attack and gives you a free extra deck dump when that monster is destroyed. Handtraps are handtraps, and you can sub out the ones I used for whichever fit the scene you're in. Same with the handtraps in the side deck. As for the 3 extra deck monsters in the side deck, you can sub these in if you refuse to give in to the temptation of the extra deck. Omega recurs resources, Link God is the biggest technically-summonable send for Punishment, and the third Fossil Warrior is like the other 2 Fossil Warriors, but he's actually happy to be here.

There's quite a few other options you can run in the deck if you want to. Almiraj helps with that whole ""you have almost zero way to set up a board first turn"" by using Adin as its link material. Mega Zaborg can dump 8 cards from both extra decks on summon, but like all Monarchs, he tends to brick your hands more often than not. Theo is bad. But he's also a Dogmatika if you really want the whole church present. Just don't play more than one. Dogmatika Encounter and Genesis are also quite bad. But if you run into an issue known as ""my opponent refuses to summon from the extra deck"", Encounter can help get your monsters on field. Genesis is still really situational though, so only run that if you know you'll be able to fulfil its activation requirements consistently. Kaijus and their like do what they've always done and eat your opponent's boss monsters before they become an issue. Lightning Storm is Lightning Storm and since you're almost always going second, it can help deal with backrow decks. Forbidden Droplets is even more insurance against your opponent's bunguses. If you lack any integrity, Rivalry of Warlords, Gozen Match, and Secret Village of the Spellcasters can also be played. But in that case, why not just play the Invoked Shaddoll heresy deck instead."

The boss monsters in this deck are as follows:

<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a>
<a data-name=""ARC Rebellion XYZ Dragon"">ARC Rebellion XYZ Dragon</a>
<a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a>
<a data-name=""Number 99: Utopic Dragon"">Number 99: Utopic Dragon</a>
<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>
<a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>

MAIN STRATEGY

First, let's hope you have drawn a <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Regulator"">Time Thief Regulator</a></strong>, and that your opponent is going first.
Let's also hope that your opponent ends their turn with a monster left in attack position that can be effected by your card effects.

First, normal summon your <strong>Time Thief Regulator</strong>, summoning <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Winder"">Time Thief Winder</a></strong> and <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Bezel Ship"">Time Thief Bezel Ship</a></strong> from your deck.

Summoning your <strong>Time Thief Winder</strong> will trigger its effect. Add <strong><a data-name=""Time Thief Adjuster"">Time Thief Adjuster</a></strong> to your hand using this effect.

XYZ summon <strong><a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a></strong>, and then activate it by detaching <strong>Bezel Ship</strong> to add <strong><a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a> </strong>to your hand. Do not set <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong>.

Special summon <strong><a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Beyond"">Number 39: Utopia Beyond</a></strong>, as the final part of <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double</strong>'s effect, using <strong>Utopia Double</strong> as the XYZ material.

This special summon will trigger <strong>Utopia Beyond</strong>'s effect, changing all of your opponent's current face-up monsters' attack to 0.

<strong>Utopia Beyond</strong> will also have 6000 attack permanently, and will not be able to attack directly due to <strong>Utopia Double</strong>'s effect.

Special summon <strong>Bezel Ship</strong> by its own effect, detaching a material from your XYZ monster. Special summoning <strong>Bezel ship</strong> will trigger <strong>Time Thief Adjuster</strong>'s effect, special summoning it as well.

XYZ summon <strong><a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a></strong> in attack position.

Enter your battle phase.

Declare an attack on any monster (You won't be able to attack directly) with <strong>Number 39: Utopia Beyond</strong>, but negate the attack with <strong>Utopia</strong>.

Negating the attack will allow you to activate <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong>. Activate it. This will allow your <strong>Utopia Beyond</strong> to attack again, doubling it's attack during the damage step.

If all goes well, your opponent will have lost all of their life points, taking 12000 damage at that time.

You do not have to play exactly this strategy. It is just as easy to use Raidraptors to achieve this same end goal.

There are many other strategies in this deck that can OTK/FTK as well. Be sure to experiment with this deck to find out which one you enjoy the most.

The side deck is outfitted with cards to be able to handle meta deck such as Virtual Worlds, and even more sinister decks, such as Drytrons or Cubics."

24. Activate codebreaker virus berserker summoning zero day and virus swordsman to Selene's open link points

25. Link codebreaker virus swordsman and selene into another selene (this time in the right extra monster zone)

26. Activate selene removing three spell counters to special summon summoner monk and activate Phoenix blade in grave banishing arboria and spatha to add Phoenix blade to hand

27. Activate summoner monk sending Phoenix blade to grave to summon rescue ferret from deck

28. Activate rescue ferret shuffling it back into the deck to summon witch of the black forest and plaguespreader zombie

35. Activate Phoenix blade in grave banishing Armageddon knight and Isolde to add Phoenix blade to hand

36. Summon exodius from hand by shuffling all monsters in grave into the deck (and place any extra deck monsters back in the extra deck) (it's a summoning condition not an activated effect)

37. Link plaguespreader and exodius into knightmare Phoenix (to knightmare gryphon's left arrow)

38. Activate plaguespreader in grave placing the Phoenix blade on top of your deck to special itself from grave

39. Link halqifibrax and plaguespreader into knightmare unicorn (in the left extra monster zone)

The end result is 5 co-linked monsters in a U-link that can't be destroyed by battle or card effect (and unicorn draws you 4 cards each one of your draw steps because of the 4 co-linked knightmares)

(There is a way to work tri-gate wizard into it but you need a few extra extenders to do it)"

This combo is relatively simple and pretty rewarding overall because it only takes one card (two if you unluckily open rasenryu)

starting off similarly to the crystal wing combo but with a different ending, here’s my ShenShen Windwitch combo

Use ice bell to summon herself and Glass Bell

Have glass bell search freeze bell or snow bell, your pick

Use snow bell or freeze bell to summon herself from your hand

use Rasenryu’s effect from your deck or hand to send ice bell and freeze bell/snow bell to the graveyard to summon itself, fast fact, rasenryu can out dragoon if needed, if possible feel free to out something.

have glass bell tune rasenryu for shenshen, rasenryu searches possessed partnerships

set possessed partnerships.

if shenshen gets destroyed (correction when, this is a little frail) you can use possessed partnerships to summon glass bell (who has 1500 defense) and search blizzard bell, blizzard bell can be normal summoned with no tributes if all you own (if you own anything) are Windwitch’s, if you do that you can tune for cloudcastle and have it revive shenshen.

I’ll Wright down more combos when I have the time."

How original. Hasn't this been done to death by now? Probably so. But that isn't going to stop me. Aside from Summoned Skull, the Harpies are my favorite Yu-Gi-Oh monsters, so naturally, this had to be done. Now I could add some variety to this and mix in another archetype like Mist Valley or Blackwind, but I'm not gonna. This is going to be Pure Harpie. Because reasons.</span>

<span>Most people have probably seen this a million times, and I wouldn't be surprised if this exact same deck has already been created (I made this from scratch in LoTD Link Evolution), so because the effects are so complex, and most people know what to expect, I'll just cover some combos you can do using this setup. The basic theme of the deck is swarming the field with average-sized boobed bird-ladies that summon a baby dragon that can destroy whatever it wants because it can. The only thing this deck lacks is jiggle physics.</span>

<span><span><em>BASIC SWARM/HARPIE'S PET BABY DRAGON:</em></span> Normal Summon <span>Harpie Channeler</span>, use <span>Elegant Egotist</span> to Special Summon either <span>Harpie Lady 1</span>, or <span>Harpie Lady Sisters</span>, then use <span>Harpie Channeler's</span> effect to Special Summon <span>Harpie's Pet Baby Dragon</span> by discarding <span>Harpie Harpist</span>. When a Dragon monster is on the field, <span>Harpie Channeler</span> becomes <span>Level 7</span>. <span>Harpie Oracle</span> can be Special Summoned when there is a <span>Level 5</span> or higher Harpie monster present. You now have at least 3 Harpie monsters on the field, activating all 3 of <span>Harpie's Pet Baby Dragon's</span> effects. During the End Phase, the effects of <span>Harpie Harpist </span>in the GY and <span>Harpie</span> <span>Oracle</span> on the field will activate. Harpist adds a Winged-Beast with 1500 or less ATK from the deck to the hand, and Oracle allows you to retrieve a card from the GY that has ""<span>Harpie Lady Sisters</span>"" in it's text, in this case, <span>Elegant Egotist</span>.</span>

<span><span><em>STAY STOCKED:</em></span> Any turn after activating <span>Hysteric Sign</span>, when it is destroyed, you can add 3 different Harpie cards from your deck to your hand. Once it's successfully activated, use one of these scenarios to quickly destroy it and fill your hand with the important things:</span>
<span>1). <span>Link Summon Harpie Conductor</span>, declare an attack on a monster you can't defeat, then activate her effect to destroy a Spell/Trap you control instead, destroy <span>Hysteric Sign</span>.</span>
<span>2). Play <span>Harpie's Hunting Ground</span>, summon a Harpie monster to trigger it's effect, destroy <span>Hysteric Sign</span>.</span>
<span>Of course, you could just wait for a monster to be targeted for an attack and use <span>Harpie Conductor</span> to activate her effect, but doing it with method #1 is obviously quicker.</span>

<span><span><em>6000 LP OR LESS = 3 TURN WIN:</em></span> If your opponent has 6000 or less Life Points, you can win the match within 3 turns assuming nothing happens to prevent the following setup. Use 3 <span>Level 4</span> WIND monsters to <strong>XYZ Summon Harpie's Pet Phantasmal Dragon</strong>. It's effect not only allows you to attack your opponent directly, but it also protects all of your Harpie monsters from being targeted by effects or attacks, as long as it has material. At the End Phase of each turn, 1 material is detached. <span>Mirror Force</span>, <span>Raigeki</span>, and similar cards, or attack prevention such as <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span> are the only way to stop this dragon's onslaught while it still has material.</span>

<span>Other useful cards:</span>
<span><span><em>Harpie's Pet Dragon</em></span>: This sexy dragon has fantastic ATK/DEF which only climbs higher the more Harpie Ladies you have. With a full field of 5 Harpie Ladies, it's attack can reach 3500. If 3 of the monsters are <span>Harpie Lady 1</span>, it will reach maximum power at 4400.
<span><em><span>Alluring Mirror Split</span></em></span>: When a Harpie Lady is destroyed by battle, Special Summon a replacement.
<span><em>Hysteric Party</em></span>: Did your opponent just activate a <span>Mirror Force</span>? That's cute. Keep 1 card in your hand to use this Trap and get all your Harpie monsters right back after they are slain.
<em><span><span>Three Of A Kind</span></span></em>: After using the BASIC SWARM strategy explained earlier, this card can be activated, which destroys 3 cards your opponent controls. Combined with <span>Harpie's Pet Baby Dragon</span>, you can rid the field of 4 of your opponent's cards during a single Main Phase.
<em><span>Harpie's Feather Storm</span></em>: A Hand-Trap that protects you from monster effects for an entire turn.
<span><em>Cyber Slash Harpie Lady</em></span>: The strongest un-boosted monster in the deck, which doesn't require any outside Tuner monsters due to her awesome transformation effect.</span>

<span>This a versatile archetype with lots of other Harpie cards bearing similar effects. Capable of swarming and destruction, there are other honorable mentions such as <span>Birdface</span>, <span>Harpie Dancer</span>, and <span>Harpie Lady Phoenix Formation</span>, among others. This is just the setup I've found to be the most reliable. You could also incorporate other archetypes that synergize well with Winged Beasts and/or WIND monsters, but as I've said before, I prefer pure Harpie. This deck is so much fun. It's won me lots of duels and is one of my favorites to use. It might not be meta, but it sure packs one heck of a punch.</span>"

</ul>
The ending board is dragner, who can turn the atk of one attacking monster 0, and hoping harbinger, who can negate the effect of a spell card once per turn, and thats not counting the extenders like double summon and recycling battle or handtraps. You can do combos a little bit biggers, but the basic board is this. If you draw thunder sea horse, a level 4 light thunder monster and wonder xyz, you can do this basic board during the opponent turn, because utopia double and utopiadragnereffects are quick effects."

 	<li>Your two normal summons are Tour Guide and Ophrys Scorpio; use whichever is needed in the moment. Targets for Tour Guide are Sangan (searching Relinquished or M-E Illusionist) and Djinn (protecting your Relinquished).</li>

 	<li>Grisaille Prison is a cheeky little side deck option against Synchro and Xyz strategies—it will reliably shut down their entire gameplan. However, you'll want to wait until they've summoned at least one big Extra Deck monster before you activate it. Otherwise your Eyes Restricts will have no targets.</li>
 	<li>If you want to side in the Kaiju package, I recommend siding out the Predaplants, Djinn, Golden-Eyes, and Faceless Illusionist. None of those pieces is necessary to your core gameplan.</li>

Red-eyes fusion is probably the most important card in this deck and with magicalize fusion as well, two copies of Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon are easy to summon.

Most of the monsters from Invincible Fortress are present here and retain their high defenses, they just operate with a different overall play style than before.</span>

<span>The main theme of the deck is utilizing Rock monster Flip-Summoning to place your opponent's monsters back into their hand, paving the way for multiple direct attacks. What makes this much easier, is that the majority of the monsters here all share the same effect of: ""Once per turn: You can change this card to face-down Defense Position"".</span>

<span><span>MAIN DECK</span></span>
<span>Each monster that can be flipped face-down once per turn activate the following effects when they are Flip-Summoned:</span>
<span><span><em><span>Golem Sentry</span></em></span> - Returns 1 of your opponent's monsters to their hand.</span>
<span><span><em><span>Guardian Sphinx</span></em></span> - Returns all of your opponent's monsters to their hand (requires 1 Tribute to summon).</span>
<span><span><em><span>Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx</span></em></span> - Shuffles all monsters your opponent controls back into the deck (requires 2 Tributes to summon).</span>
<span><span><em><span>Medusa Worm</span></em></span> - Destroys 1 monster your opponent controls.
<span><em><span>Des Lacooda</span></em></span> - You draw 1 card.
<span><em><span>Moai Interceptor Cannons</span></em></span> - Can be flipped face down, but does not have a secondary effect.</span>

<span>There are also various ways to protect your monsters. Controlling <span>Hieracosphinx</span> prevents your opponent from attacking your face down monsters, while <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span> prevents all attacks against you for 3 turns. <span>Catapult Zone</span> can be used to protect your important monsters while sending high level monsters to the GY for easy Special Summoning via <span>The Shallow Grave</span>, and <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> (be mindful that <span>The Shallow Grave</span> also works for your opponent). <span>Terraforming</span> and <span>Metaverse</span> provide easy access to <span>Catapult Zone</span>.</span>

<span>Other high level monsters include <span>Criosphinx</span> and <span>Exxod, Master Of The Guard</span>. <span>Criosphinx</span> synergizes well with <span>Golem Sentry</span>, <span>Guardian Sphinx</span>, and <span>Ordeal Of A Traveler</span>. These cards return other cards to the hand, and each time a monster is returned to the opponent's hand, <span>Criosphinx</span> causes your opponent to randomly discard 1 card. This can be done multiple times per turn. <span>Exxod, Master Of The Guard</span> combos effectively with any monster that can be flipped face down. Sporting 4000 DEF, he acts as a wall that burns the opponent for 1000 damage each time an EARTH monster is Flip-Summoned, (which is the entire deck lol) although Tributing a Sphinx monster is required to Special Summon him. The effects of <span>Golem Sentry</span> and/or either Sphinx monster can really hurt the opponent, and leave an opening for them to finish off the remainder of Life Points.</span>

<span>The final monster is <span>Des Lacooda</span>, who can also be flipped face down once per turn. This creepy looking guy is a draw engine and the only monster who can be used to <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> <strong>Soul Of Silvermountain</strong>. <span>Des Lacooda</span> is a Zombie monster however, and cannot be protected by <span>Catapult Zone</span>, but can still trigger the effect of <span>Exxod </span><span>due to it's EARTH attribute.</span></span>

<span><span>Attack The Moon</span> is fantastic when you have at least 1 monster that can be flipped. Once per turn, when a Rock monster changes it's battle position, you destroy one of your opponents Spell/Traps. Flipping a monster face-up is a position change. There are also 2 <span>Dust Tornadoes</span> for a little more coverage.</span>

<span>Lastly, <span>Staunch Defender</span> can be used to force your opponents to attack monsters they cannot defeat, such as any Sphinx monster or <span>Exxod</span>.</span>

<span><span>EXTRA DECK</span></span>
<span>There are 4 different <strong>XYZ</strong> monsters, 3 of which require 2 <span>Level 4</span> monsters, and only 1 that requires 2 <span>Level 3's.</span> <strong>Number 55: Gogogo Goliath</strong> lets you add <span>Level 4</span> or lower EARTH monsters from your GY to your hand, recycling any defeated monsters. <strong>Gallant Granite</strong> is an amazing searcher, as he allows you to either add any Rock monster from your deck to your hand, or Special Summon one in face-down defense position, providing a very simple way to get your hands on <span>Exxod</span> or <span>Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx</span>, as well as summon the latter without having to Tribute Summon. <strong>Number 52: Diamond Crab King's</strong> rather complex effect can be strategically used to either provide a solid defensive wall, or unleash a devastating attack. Lastly, <strong>Soul Of Silvermountain, </strong><span>the only <span>Rank 3</span> monster in the Extra Deck</span> renders 2 of your opponent's set Spell/Traps from being used as long as it exists on the field.</span>

<span>This deck is a lot of fun to use and has won me quite a bit of duels, both in real life, and in the Link Evolution video game. Feel free to share any ideas/strategies that you think might work better and I'll look into them.</span>"

Ojamas and Melffys act as an advantage engine to hard make the links usually by stalling through your opponent's first turn and using Mellfy Catty and Ojama Pajama getting a Red with Cat and searching and immediately discarding an Ojamagic to get your three vanillas. Use Rescue Cat and Obedience Schooled to both make your Melffy XYZ and access your mini Tri-Brigade engine. This deck has been my baby for the past couple months and I now share it with you. I'm sharing this more to see how you all take this decks shape and upgrade it.

&nbsp;

From here on there are a lot of ways to FTK. The most consistent one is with trickstar black catbat as it doesn't need any extra cards in the main deck but it takes forever. A much faster way is to add evigishki gustkraken and gishki aquamirror to the deck for a handloop and end with triple herald of perfection, apollousa and double herald of mirage lights.

This tries to capture the feeling of drawing that blue bricky card and be able to play it like a regular monster just as we all did as kids.

The main strategy of this deck relies on Phul (Ritual From the Deck), Bethor (Blow up opponents cards) and Phaleg to increase the attack of ALL monster you have on your side of the field, *also the effect stacks*

It's another very *VERY* casual deck but really cheap and easy to pilot after reading all the card text feels very intuitive

Have fun and enjoy the main deck links without the arrows!"
