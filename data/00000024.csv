I use those that I think will be the most universal against most of the decks (not only Meta). Here, of course, a lot depends on the archetype of the opponents monsters and their support cards . Of course, Ash is dominant here. Why then I only use two. I use Effect Veiler to have an additional emergency card to pay the cost Galaxy Soldier. Other cards will also be good here such as Ghost Ogre or Nibiru or other powerful light hand traps. Here, of course, all depends on the opponent's deck.  Or maybe more about Pot's. I used 3. They perfectly complement the decks and make it move (together with other engins). The most controversial is Pot of Desires. Someone will say that this is crazy with a deck like this. And I will say: Is it not madness to leave the field blank when you have dead hands ? And if you have a good hand: you add what you have to add, you are using what you are supposed to use, you are doing a combo and finally you use Pot of Desires. Maybe something else can be strengthened hehe GL HF.  Here's a video :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3WH0gtc_lo"

The Activation and Search effect of Forward is HOPT. Meanwhile the 2nd effect of Forward is SOPT, so you can use multiples same turn.  Knuckle + Overdrive = ""Machina Overdrive"" SS effect from deck will RESOLVE WITHOUT EFFECT if the TARGET LEAVE the FIELD BEFORE RESOLUTION, because Overdrive check names at resolution. So cl1 Overdrive cl2 Knuckle SEND ITSELF don't works. But cl1 Overdrive cl2 Knuckle SEND Box for Example works.  Super Dora + Overdrive = cl1 Overdrive cl2 Super Dora tgt itself works because you don't need to destroy the target in order to summon. It will SS the Machina monster but fail destroying Super Dora due to either Dora Quick eff, Goliath's or Dingirsu's Protection.  Ice Dragon's Prison/D. D. Crow vs Knuckle/Overdrive = cl1 IDP/D. D. Crow target Bullet Train cl2 Knuckle target itself and Bullet Train = SOLVE WITHOUT EFFECT cl1 IDP/D. D. Crow target Bullet Train cl2 Overdrive target Bullet Train, Banished Tunneller and Banished Trencher = SOLVE WITHOUT EFFECT  ""Droll&amp;Lock Bird"" vs Overdrive = can play around Droll&amp;Lock Bird using Overdrive GY effect during the DRAW Phase.  ""Machina CITADEL"" effect to Destroy will Resolve without effect if the target leave the field before resolution, because Citadel checks ATK stats at resolution.  ""Machina CITADEL"" 1st effect to destroy will ATTEMPT to Destroy Super Dora and Opponent's Monsters: cl1 CITADEL target Super Dora cl2 Super Dora tgt itself = DESTROY all Opponent's Monsters with 32atk or Less but fail Destroying Dora due to either Dora Quick eff, Goliath's or Dingirsu's Protection.  ""Machina FORTRESS"" 2nd effect its MANDATORY so it Will ALWAYS be Chain Link 1, in the case of crash in battle phase Citadel eff in GY will be cl2.  As long as a XYZ have battled, either Opponent's or yours, during your turn you can attempt to SS Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder For example you can do: Goliath atk opponent's XYZ in Defense position and in M2 use Stormer eff tribute Goliath and Goliath eff Attach to Stormer and AA-ZEUS on top of Stormer.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////Comments:  Bullet Train on the field as soon as possible has you playing around Nibiru with at least adding a follow up in the end phase. You activate your worst cards first and best last after bait interactions. For example if you open with Starter and Redeployment you start playing with Starter and save the Redeployment for later. RANK-9 play is more sensitive to hand traps compared to standard deck play.  What you can do in turn 3: Use Anchor Drill to summon Box and go to a RANK-8 DINGIRSU and use eff to send a card or Attach 1 Infinitrack banished like Trencher for example and go to battle phase to make AA-ZEUS with 4 materials. Other plays: Discard a card to revive Knuckle to tribute for Dozer and summon Tunneller/Trencher and because you already have Stormer in GY you go to LINK-1 Goliath and use Stormer eff in GY and in the resolution use Goliath eff to attach to Stormer and use eff to Search whatever fix your hand like Citadel/Derricrane/Fortress.

Back row traps help for your protection. ","Pretty simple deck mechanic here. Take away opponent's monsters with Kaijus, and use the Yosenjus to get your Kaiju back (Yosenju 1) or beat over it with an extra deck monster. Yosenjus come back to hand after normal summon, so it's a good idea to have back row protection and interruptions. There are a bunch of different cards to use and it's pretty easy to stay on the cheaper side. I have two droplets hence why there are two in there, but you can easily replace those with anything else. You can also interchange the traps (most people wouldn't play SMF, but I like it for the return). Side deck is also very interchangeable of course for whatever the meta is, and I would even have some back row disruptors possibly in there (Harpie's FD, TT, etc)."

""FTK"" more than 9 times out","Add Makyura to your hand with Painful Choice or Pot of Duality (or just draw it), then discard it with Dark World Dealings or Graceful Charity, after that use Painful Choice to thin out the deck (preferably by having another Painful Choice as one of the 5 cards, since the AI seems to always choose Painful Choice when you go with 5 Spell Cards, unless Chicken Game is one of the cards, then the AI seems to choose that instead.)  Also keep a Magical Mallet in hand at all times if you can, so that you can shuffle the Exodia pieces you've likely aquired back into the deck (in case you end up with something that might have you discard an Exodia piece) and draw new cards to likely extend the play unless you get really unlucky. (I am currently testing to swap out one Magical Mallet for a Dark Factory of Mass Production, to render this less of a problem, or to not completely screw you over if the opponent carries an annoying hand trap in their starting hand or something.)  Notes:  I'm not completely sure running 3x Dark World Dealings is the best idea with the discard effect. (Though it is more of a niche ""This could go wrong in very specific situations"" thing and it does help with discarding Makyura the Destructor now that I'm using a RML instead of Armageddon Knight.)  I switched out the Armageddon Knight for Royal Magical Library, as I already have plenty of ways to get Makyura to the graveyard, and RML helps extend plays those few times the ""Heart of the cards"" is not with me, heh.  Im wondering which out of Foolish Burial and Reinforcement of the Army would actually be the most consistent and complimentary. (Probably Foolish Burial considering I went for a RML instead of an Armageddon Knight.)  Also, I'm trying to minimize the amount of Trap cards, while still not rendering Makyuras effect completely moot, and Reckless Greed in this case works really well with Graceful Charity when activated from the hand as a chain, as you'll draw two extra cards before having to discard, which also makes it less likely to have things go kaputt."

The eldlich stuff goes around the brave token restrictions, so I thought it would be a decent strategy to add into it. Some of the synergies here is if you have phoenix enforcer you can pop an eldland to get more advantage or the equip spell while you control a brave token to get it back. Overall I'm a pretty bad deck builder and a better version of this decklist is definitely out there but this has been pretty good."

Yes, you need to draw specifically a starter and an extender, but at least you'll still be able to play through those handtraps with these extender. I'm also using some Sky Striker card as a pseudo called by the grave to dodges handtraps on the activation of Scrap Wyvern or 'Rusty Bardiche'. So the way you do these line is for example: (Scenario) <ol>  	<li>you summon Scrap Recycler and activates it's effect to send a machine monster from your deck to the GY, and let say your opponent ash/imperm your 'Scrap Recycler'. so then you activate Cyberdark Claw searching Cyberdark Realm which then search your additional normal summon Cyberdark Chimera. Then with these 2 you make Scrap Wyvern. With the 'Cyberdark' cards, you will an extender and also a free pop with Scrap Wyvern's effect saving you an important card that normally you got to destroy or if you want to preserve your Scrap Wyvern. and then from there you just go ahead and do the full combo and pray to lord jesus god Cimoooooooo that your opponent doesn't have anymore interaction</li>  	<li>somehow you draw your World Wand/your Machina Citadel alongside Scrap Recycler. These are not considered to be a brick, cuz with Scrap Recycler you will then send your Machina Fortress, which then you can summon by sending either the World Wand/Machina Citadel. and with Machina Citadel in grave, your Scrap Wyvern are basically immune to Ash Blossom cuz you can chainblock it's effect.</li>  	<li>The Girsu line are basically the same as the scrap line, if you draw an extender with girsu, you won't be able to end on an Apoloussa, but you'll at least end on Rusty Bardiche + I:P + 2 Fog Blade + Ding in grave. so it is potentially 5 interruption which is not bad.</li> </ol> Keep in mind, that this build of the deck are not perfect and can still be improved. i just really really hate losing to handtrap that much. oh also, this deck hard loses to spells and traps that interact with your board (example: Lightning Storm and Evenly Match) cuz the end board only deals with monster effect with no spell/trap negation."

Because of this we play a lot of two ofs. This are cards we would like to draw, but don't want to see both copies in the first couple of draws. This deck also has some dead hands, not having Radiation isn't that big of problem as dependent on the hand, you can just do a standard Icejade or Ursarctic line. I might increase the Ursarctic field spell to two, cause they has been a issue sometimes."

The deck really lacked consistency and I had to add couple of pot of desires even though I like using the extra deck as a toolbox and I feel like the pot banishes too much of it. The deck just really wasn't consistent when I tested it without the pots. But I feel like the deck maintains more cards in hand than my edge imp variant of the deck, but edge imp engine is maybe a better at recovery due to edge imp scissor. The biggest problem of the deck is probably that it is very weak to disruption. So going second is usually hard against combo and control decks, and going first requires the use use of crossout designators and caleld by the grave. The other problem is that the recovery is quite weak for non-tuner monsters. Red rising dragon can revive tuners etc but you really have to get another serziel to your hand or chaos ruler the chaotic magical dragon to your graveyard to recover from board wipes. Often this is not needed however since the goal is to just go into a mean disruption board. Overall I really like how this turned out. It is fairly consistent and red super nova dragon is just a boss.</span>  https://youtu.be/w1nHL-Ey6Gw"

I mostly play Fusion decks and I've decided to share my Branded Albaz deck list. I've been play testing and building this deck since it first got released in Dawn of Majesty, from splashing it with Darklords to making it work with Valkyries with <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch</a>, and I think this is by far the best iteration of the deck that I've been building.  <strong><span>A few questions you might have:</span></strong>  <span>• ""Why run <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>?"" - I'm actually surprised as to why not a lot of people run this card, considering the fact that it helps you dodge targeting effects like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>.</span>  <span>• ""Why run 3 <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> unlike most lists?"" - It's a searchable Solemn Warning that also helps you recur your ""Branded"" Spells/Traps from your GY, which are either <a data-name=""Screams of the Branded"">Screams of the Branded</a> or <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> as your main targets. A recyclable and searchable Super Polymerization is always great for a Fusion deck.</span>  <span>• ""4 Destiny HERO monsters and a Dark Magician?"" - Unlike most Fusion decks that run DPE/Dragoon, these five monsters aren't really bricks, since all of them are DARK monsters, and there are hands that you'd be glad that you've drawn at least 1 Destiny HERO monster and/or Dark Magician, since there are combo lines that allows you to bring out both two of either Dragoon, DPE, and/or a Dynatag boosted Dystopia.</span>  <span>• ""No Prosperity/Handtraps/Crossout?"" - Maybe it's just me, but I don't think running Prosperity in a deck with an already tight enough Extra Deck space is a good idea. If you feel like doing it, sure. It just isn't my cup of tea. If you wanna run hand traps, I suggest only those with LIGHT/DARK Attributes, for obvious reasons but then, you'd much rather run Kaijus of said Attributes/<a data-name=""Santa Claws"">Santa Claws<span data-darkreader-inline-color=""""> and cards that immediately address threats than trying to generate card advantage (which this deck already doesn't have much problem doing anyway).</span></a><a data-name=""Santa Claws""> </a></span>  <span><strong>Strengths:</strong></span>  <span>• It's a bit toolbox-y (as per most Fusion decks nowadays), but variety and flexibility is always a welcome trait especially for Fusion decks.</span>  <span>• It breaks monster heavy boards with ease, and with the addition of <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus</a>, breaking an entire Dragon Link board has never been easier.</span>  <span>• Much like other meta Fusion decks in the past, it can grind just as hard as them. It's a resource focused deck, and even with the help of <a data-name=""Lubellion, the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion, the Searing Dragon</a>, you'd still wanna be cautious.</span>  <span>• Can easily play around Droll &amp; Lock bird and most hand traps, and despite being able to swarm easily, getting hit by a Nibiru isn't really as punishing.</span>  <span><strong>Weaknesses: </strong><span>• Does not have an innate answer to back row, although that's what your side deck is for.</span><strong> </strong></span>  <span>• It does brick at certain occasions, though it can easily be remedied by having at least 1 LIGHT/DARK monster in either field, usually.</span>  <span>• Mirror matches can be <strong>REALLY</strong> tough and grindy so as per usual, be mindful of your resources.</span>  <span>• Floodgates, as per usual.</span>  <span><strong>Some other neat Fusion monster/Fusion engine choices for your choosing: <span>•</span></strong><span> You can never go wrong with Invoked in any Fusion strategy.</span></span>  <span>• A <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> engine with ratios of your liking. <a data-name=""Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman"">Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</a> is a crazy card.</span>  <span>• If you're not a fan of <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>, you could always substitute it with either a <a data-name=""Light Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a> for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Dark Cavalry"">Dark Cavalry</a> or <a data-name=""Dark Paladin"">Dark Paladin</a> aren't bad ideas either, considering that you have four Warrior-type monsters (five, if you're also using a <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> engine.) Both are additional negations and are decent beat sticks, one of which pierces.</span>  <span>• More semi-generic Super Polymerization targets like <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a>, <a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Despian Proskenion</a>, <a data-name=""Mysterion the Dragon Crown"">Mysterion the Dragon Crown</a>, etc.</span>  &nbsp;  Closing thoughts:  Invoked Dogmatika and Dragon Link/Dragonmaid are the most fun match ups you can have, and ""Konami pls ban Verte"" <strong>KEKW</strong>"

This time splashing the <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> package in a 60-card deck, pretty hefty but surprisingly consistent. My previous Branded Albaz deck list already have more than enough Dragon hate, it won't hurt for us to add even more. Not much significant change(s) in terms of the Branded Albaz ratios, only in the Extra Deck where I've decided to cut some more generic Fusion monsters to test other possible options (I am actually heavily considering <a data-name=""Mysterion the Dragon Crown"">Mysterion the Dragon Crown</a> just because there are a lot of lines that allows you to make it with ease). <span>Also, one thing I forgot mentioning in my previous deck list is that <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> speeds up the deck significantly, not only because it draws you cards (which actually works well by discarding your <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> or <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>) but it also sends <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> from the deck to the GY. You could always cut <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"">Destiny HERO - Dynatag</a> and other Destiny HERO monster to make some space for it.</span>  <strong>Keeping it short and simple:</strong>  <span><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>, and <a data-name=""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"">Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</a> is a guaranteed <a data-name=""Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman"">Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</a> with Buster lock during your opponent's turn, either <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> (recommended if you opened <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>) or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, and an additional 2 interruptions in the form of <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a>, mainly depending on your discards, which are made even better with drawing the ""bricks"" (<a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>, the Destiny HERO monsters, etc.)</span>  <span>Side deck is always debatable, but I still do highly suggest Kaijus and outs that immediately address the board (<a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, etc.) than hand traps and floodgates.</span>  <span><b>Note:</b> </span><span>I really tried making it as compact as possible, but 47-50 cards is the lowest I could get it to work without sacrificing consistency and options.</span>"

Playing magician pendulum monster and tuning magician lets us go into a halqifibrax combo with one card without using pendulum summons which you can save as a second wave. Harmonizing Magician can summon the other half of a synchro summon or go into a halqifibrax combo. The deck is very consistent being mostly card search effects and plays through most disruption well if you know how to pilot it.

Albion the Shrouded, Fallen of Albaz, and the ""Branded"" set of cards allow us to play that archetype, as well as providing most of our fusion monsters and fusion support.  Dogmatika Punishment is great for both destroying things, and putting reanimation targets into the grave.  Dragon Ravine is great for grave filler, and Waking the Dragon's just for fun as much as anything else.  The Dark -- Hex-Sealed Fusion is also great for fusions.  Galactic Spiral Dragon and Nebula Dragon are both decent fillers, while Keeper of the Shrine is there just in case I ever actually have to properly tribute summon something.  Into the extra deck we have: the Branded friends, Albion, Brigrand, and Titaniklad, which work with Fallen of Albaz, have some not-bad abilities, and are beefy enough reanimation targets.  Starving Venom Fusion Dragon is an alternate for the three above, as Dark's a pretty common attribute at my table, and he's not bad either, despite easy requirements.  Starving Venemy Dragon's a pet card, but it's also decent, and weakens opponents over time if they can't get rid of it and/or have a grave-combo-heavy deck.  Beelze and Beelzeus are strictly grave fodder/reanimation targets. Wouldn't be too hard to build into, I just don't care to. Once they're out they're hard to get rid of anyways."

The dinosaur archetype got a new card in the ocg called Uradora of Fate. What that card does is: Pay 1000 lp to target 1 of your monsters and it (until the end of your opponents next turn) gains 1000 attack and when it destroys a monster by battle, reveal the bottom card of your deck to put either on top or on the bottom of your deck, if the card was a dinosaur, dragon, sea serpent, or wyrm monster, draw 1 card and gain 1000 lp for every 1000 attack the card has.  The reason that this card is so broken, is that Ultimate Conductor Tyranno can attack multiple times per turn and can beat over almost anything that it attacks so it will activate the effect multiple times to potentially draw a ton of cards and gain a ton of lp."

Some of the usual combos I made were:  1- Pollux/Algeidi + any lvl4 = congrats, you have the most repeated R4 Xyz play of this deck  2- Pollux + Sheratan = Normal summon Pollux, then Sheratan. search for Caduceus, special summon it, search start chart with it. end with an R4 Xyz summon + Almiraj using Sheratan + Draw 1 if summoned a constellar Xyz mosnter with Star chart  3- Algeidi/Pollux/Caduceus + Kaus = normal summon Pollux/Algeidi or special summon Caduceus, then bring Kaus to the field. Activate it twice so you get 2 lvl 5 materials for your Pleiades. With Caduceus you can get Star chart an draw 1.  4- Galaxy soldier + discard material = easy CDI  Use Siat and Sombre for recovery/play-starts and that's pretty much it. Twinkle can be used very easely with 1 constellar in GY to make Pleiades, so dont be shy to search it with the Pollux+Sheratan combo.

There are many routes to the boss monster; however, the most practical sequence is <strong>Dark Infant</strong> (search out Ignister AILand) &gt;&gt; <strong>Cyberse Wicckid</strong> (search out Bururu) &gt;&gt; <strong>Splash Mage</strong> (don't use effect for the meantime) &gt;&gt; <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> (summon Splash Mage then use its effect) &gt;&gt; <strong>Dark Templar</strong> (optional, depending on availability of elements required) &gt;&gt; <strong>Arrival</strong> (with ideally at least 5000 ATK). Of course, other cards (@Ignister effect monsters, resurrection spells, searching spells) are omitted in the sequence due to the indeterminate game state.  The logic behind the sequence is that the field spell <strong>Ignister AILand</strong> only allows you to special summon when there are no monsters on your Main Monster zone. These link monsters serve as buffers, which allow you to special summon @Ignister effect monsters from your hand or through spells (<strong>FAIghting Spirit</strong>, <strong>AIdle Reborn</strong>). You have to keep track which @Ignister monsters have activated their effects due to the once per turn restriction.  Also, you must keep track of the elements of your summoned monsters in order to fulfill the requirements for Arrival. If you have <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> (Earth), <strong>Splash Mage</strong> (Water), and <strong>another monster summoned by Splash Mage's effect</strong> while you have <strong>Doshin</strong> (Earth) and/or <strong>Hiyari</strong> (Water) on your hand, you can go for <strong>Dark Templar</strong> (Dark) and use its effect along with resurrection spells (<strong>FAIghting Spirit</strong>, <strong>AIdle Reborn</strong>) or a search spell (<strong>AI Meet You</strong>) in order to bring out 5 different elements from the GY or hand. For emergencies, use <strong>Link Disciple</strong> (Light) to replace a redundant element.  When Link summoning, don't forget to start from the effect monsters all the way to the Link monsters in ascending Link rating; starting from the Link-3 <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> or <strong>Dark Templar</strong> will only allow you to select at most three other materials since <strong>Arrival</strong> is a Link-6 (This is for Dueling Nexus mechanics).  If you feel like you can't bring out 5000 ATK <strong>Arrival</strong> due to the lack of resources, you can choose to go for other @Ignister monsters (<strong>Fire Phoenix</strong>, <strong>Light Dragon</strong>, etc.) or <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> for board cleaning.  If there are other useful cards that were not included here, please leave a comment so that I can broaden my horizons through the spirit of learning, and perhaps grief my opponents with a stronger deck. Thank you for viewing."

Even though Paleo Frog is super nerfed here, it's one of my favorite decks so I decided to pilot it and give it a shot. I wouldn't super recommend it unless you're a massive fanatic of the deck like I am, but here we are.  You should probably play 3 Reasoning and Pot of Desires, was just concerned about SR crafting mats.

This is the deck that I've used to grind in Master Duel, Tenyi ft. <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a>, <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a>. It's absolutely cheap, you only really need two in-archetype UR cards and 3 in-archetype SR cards, and the entire Tenyi core in the main deck is literally made up of Rares and Commons. This deck has only one goal in mind, and that is to set up <a data-name=""Avramax"">Avramax</a> as soon as you can and summon either <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> going 1st or <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a> as soon as you can.</span>  <strong>A few questions you might have:</strong>  <span>• ""Why <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> instead of <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a>?"" - Because the former only requires you to tribute one monster for its Tribute Summon, and that actually matters because it allows you to have enough monsters for a Synchro Summon of a defensive monster like <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> alongside your <a data-name=""Avramax"">Avramax</a>, which is actually a better option than <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> since <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> prevents you from activating the effects of non-""Tenyi"" monsters that are Special Summoned from the Extra Deck upon using its effect to Special Summon a Wyrm monster from the GY (most likely a Mare Mare).</span>  <span>• ""<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> on the main?"" - Yes, there are no side decks (as of now) in Master Duel. These slots could be for any high impact/consistency staples, really, and that includes your hand traps if you're the type of guy who prefers <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> over anything. If you don't have any defensive hand traps yet, you can add more <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a>, <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a>, and <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a> in a ratio of your liking.</span>  I wanna keep it short and sweet since it's a pretty straightforward deck to play, and there's really nothing much else to say about it. Have fun."

An awesome day, a very good day indeed. Sky Striker are rockting in the new and most anticipated MASTER DUEL,So this an all time favorite list that I had the pleasure to build, and everything for free. Do you wanna see?</span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Disclaimers</i></b>  <span>     This game follows an aumagnation of banlist (OCG + TCG), so a lot( and I Say really a lot) are different from the usual cards that you are familiar with. So expect cards like MAX “C” and other abomination.</span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Starters</i></b>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Raye</b><span>: This cute girl or your main starter. She can bring almost every   sky striker monster in your extra deck and makes a good protection for your Links sky striker monsters against destruction, 'cause Raye can bring herself from the GY and link again in another sky striker. </span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x</b> <span>Sky Striker Ace - Roze</span><b> :</b><span> The fearsome antagonist of Raye,  Roze can be another great starter for the sky striker link play. The effect that she can be summoned with another sky striker is good, but the effect that she returns to the field when an opponent's monster is removed from the extra monster zone is beyond insane, additionally can also negate the effect of another opponent's monster. This card is insane. </span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones</b><b>: </b><span> another way to summon the links monster. Furthermore it can be used for other combos utilizing link-2 monsters like  </span><b>Sky Striker Ace - Zeke</b><b>. </b>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Reinforcement of the army</b><b> : </b><span>search Raye of Roze depending on your needs.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>2x </span><b>Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</b> <b>:</b><span> Guess who is at 2? Sky F@#$ing striker Moblize engage! This card is a pot of greed on legs, searching for sky striker cards and with the right set up, makes 1+ in card advantage by drawing another card from the deck. The cherry in the cake is that it is not once per turn, so you can recycle with </span><b>Striker Ace - Kagari</b><b>. This card was banned for a reason and I’m happy to see its back.</b>  <b> </b>  <b>1x Chicken Game:  </b><span>Man.. I love this card , it is so risky yet so  satisfying to use to draw 3 or 4 cards,  almost a prosperity. I wish I could play it on tcg.</span>  &nbsp;  <b><i>Pseudo Starters</i></b>  <span>  They’re considered starter only if certain conditions are fulfilled (combination with other specific cards, luck in a draw, etc.)</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</b><b> + 2x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole</b><b>: </b><span> Area zero can dig more in your deck while finding a copy of the sky striker monster or a sky striker spell. In other cases, you can use  Multirole to pop Area zero and get a free summon of Roze or Raye.</span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Extenders</i></b>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</b><b>: </b><span> You can search some cards by dig 3 card in your deck, but you have to pop one of  your cards. You can use this effect  like explained above  or  to pop any monster of your opponent  in combination with  </span><b>Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</b><b>.</b>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Terraforming</b><b>: </b><span> Search  </span><b>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</b><span> to help in your plays, additionally you can search </span><b>Chicken Game </b><span>.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Upstart Goblin</b><b>: </b><span> Draw a card, nothing to explain.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole</b><b>: </b><span>This card shines with your second effect to use every Sky Striker spell … all over again. Insane and deserve to be limited. Also, make any sky striker magic cards irresponsible by any effect of your opponent. This card, at least for me, worked  better at 2 instead of 3. Maybe in the future I’ll cut to 1.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</b><b>: </b><span>She is amazing and  the perfect monster to stall your opponent with Mystic mine if you decide to side it. She can also send a sky striker spell to late recovery with </span><b>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</b><span>.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</b><b>: </b><span>The effect of adding to your hand any sky striker spell is outrageous. Cycle spell, recover spell that was negated, search cards in conjunction with </span><b>Sky Striker Ace - Hayate</b><span>… this card does so much for one card that deserves the time that was limited. Now you can even recycle </span><b>Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</b><b>... what a time to be alive.</b>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku</b><b>: </b><span>This is your primally way to get the spell  like </span><b>Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</b><span> And every thing that you wanted, too bad it only in you final phase, but She can be a fine protection by lowering the opponent's monster attack by 100 for each spell card in the GY.</span>  <span> </span>  <span> </span>  <span> </span>  <span> </span>  <b><i>Controller/Defenders</i></b>  <span> </span>  <b>2x </b><b>Infinite Impermanence + 2 x effect Veiler</b><b> :</b><span> Handtraps are always welcome to control any kind of play ( or plan) that your opponent may have.

I’ll miss the second one</span>  <span> </span>  <b>3x </b><b>Sky Striker Mecha - Shark Cannon</b><b>: </b><span>Your </span><b>D .D . Crow</b><span> in spell form, can distrusted some plays of your opponent, and also can special summon one of this opponent's monsters  in your side of the field to generate advantage (</span><b>Masked HERO Dark Law</b><span> For example) or to be a  link folder.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>1x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Zeke</b><b> + 1x </b><b>Sky Striker Ace - Kaina</b><b>:</b><span> Both have a similar role that can be exploited in the opponent’s turn. Kaina can be summoned by the effect of Raye in the opponent’s turn and not allowing a monster to attack. Zeke on the other hand, can be used with Roze and Raye to banish a monster in your summon.</span>  <span> </span>  <b>2x Mind Control:  </b><span>Communism in the form of a card.

Salamangreats offer easy Link plays, easy GY recovery and search tools. You can board wi","Your main strategy is to start with Foxy (for +1), Link summon Balelynx (Link 1) and grab Sanctuary (for +1 and protection),  and/or use special summon bodies like Jack Jaguar and Spinny to advance to Sunlight Wolf (Link 2) and special summon another body to his link (for +1), then advance into Heatleo (Link 3) for non-destruction Spell/Trap removal or Pyro Phoenix (Link 4) and activate Sanctuary to summon him on top of itself to full wipe your opponent's board.  After you finish your Link plays you should end up with at least 1 Balelynx and a few Salamangreats in your GY. After this point you can set your counters (Roar, Solemn Judgment and Infinite Impermanence) and prepare yourself for the coming turn. Roar is basically a budget Solemn Judgment that has no cost and only requires you to have 1 Salamangreat Link monster (which you can always have, even Balelynx works) and you can recover it afterwards when you Link summon on top of the same monster with Sanctuary's effect. Make sure you start your plays with Foxy to benefit from pure +1 and use your Circle to pick whatever Salamangreat you are currently missing in your hand. More names = more summons, because each Salamangreat effect monster has a hard once per turn tied to its special summon.  Salamangreats are very versatile and offer easy recovery from GY. Only problem they have is non-target removal and that's why it is a budget deck. Decode Talker, Transcode Talker, Rasterliger and Flame Administrator are simply to offer ATK boost incase you run into a destruction immune boss monster. Firewall Dragon is cumbersome to summon but if you have Will Of The Salamangreat and Sanctuary on the field, you can summon Sunlight Wolf on top of itself to revive the second copy from GY and go into Firewall Dragon easily. It offers non-destruction removal in case you need it."

Plays well through interruptions and has an excellent grind game.,"Crystal Beasts, Tri-Brigades, and Albaz have a myriad of synergies with each other that this deck aims to exploit.  The Crystal Beast engine adds level 4 Beasts to the field and beasts/dragons to the hand, generating a ton of card advantage but lacking a clear way to exploit that advantage.  Tri-Brigades use those beasts on field to advance their plays and use the extra cards added to hand from Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon to pay costs of cards like Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm, Tri-Brigade Ferrijit, and Tri-Brigade Kerass. These are the monsters that create the big plays and provide much of the grind game.  Tri-Brigade Mercourier, when banished, can add one of several cards from your deck to hand. Most often, you will often grab Albion the Shrouded, whose effect sends Branded Blade from Deck to grave in order to draw and add Mercourier back to hand. When in hand, it functions as a monster negate when you have an Albaz on the field  Branded in High Spirit converts a beast/dragon in hand into any of your albaz-related monsters - most often you'll grab Springans Kitt which can then special summon itself and grab Branded in Red or Branded Condemnation. It will send either Brigand or Albion the Branded Dragon from extra deck to grave, which will supply you an additional interruption or follow-up.  Allure of Darkness either converts the Rainbow Dark Dragon into tangible advantage or triggers Tri-Brigade Mercourier (providing a +2 when used to add Albion the Shrouded)  Your typical going first play is to land on Verte + Bearbrumm on field with mercourier in hand, then use Verte to send Branded Fusion to grave, fusing Albaz from deck with the Bearbrumm on field into Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon.  Then Bearbrumm will add Revolt to your hand. If you opened branded in high spirits, this can be further backed up with Branded in Red (for Guardian Chimera) and/or Branded Condemnation, leaving you with a board of 5-6 interruptions all coming from different places and a ton of cards added to your hand on the opponent's turn for turn 3 to guarantee you win the duel."

Not Only that but this deck does run Monk of the Tenyi and Mystery Shell Dragon which combo with the tenyi monster effects from field and graveyard.</li>  	<li>Mystery Shell dragon is a Normal Monster with a solid 2000 attack which can be used for the virus cards and it's also a Wyrm type monster which can be used to summon Shaman of the Tenyi.</li>  	<li>Mask of Darkness was originally a joke since yknow we wear mask during the Pandemic to face off a virus.... but it's effect cycles trap cards which is good for a Trap deck like this.</li>  	<li>Tribe-Infecting Virus, I was originally going to run 3 of these but I only have 1 in the collection lol and 6$ for one is pretty expensive. You could interchange mask of darkness for the other two if you choose too. ( Listen only because you can afford hefty cards and 6$ isn't a lot doesn't mean we lower class don't exist)</li>  	<li>Dust Kaiju is just an overall good card since it tributes one of your opponents monsters so you could get rid of some annoying cards. Plus this can combo with Lair of Darkness and a virus card if you were to summon a kaiju on your opponent field you could use a virus to tribute the same kaiju since lair of darkness allows you to tribute opponent monsters.</li>  	<li>Lilith is a trap card search so you basically guarantee a virus in the hand as long as you have her on the field.</li>  	<li>Eldlich is just a great card since he can summon himself after a long process, not necessarily great but he could some in clutch with the attack stats.</li>  	<li>Recurring Nightmare cycles lilith, mystery shell, and Ahrima which is always great since they all have they're purposes.</li>  	<li>Allure of Darkeness is +1 and this deck is full of dark type monsters so it shouldn't be a big problem.</li>  	<li>The Fang of Critais summons doom virus dragon which has a crush card virus type of effect which is good plus if you so happen too you can use it as material for a virus card.</li>  	<li>I shouldn't have to explain Lair of Darkness this deep in.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Cyclone is one of the few spell and trap negates in the deck which is why I chose the banish effect over MST or Twin Twisters.</li>  	<li>All the virus cards are what run the deck which is why the monsters either have strong attack or strong defense, The weaker virus cards though have more copies since I feel those cards are more accessible in requirements compared to the stronger virus cards like grinning grave and eradicator virus</li>  	<li>Aight so Originally the deck ran Imperial Order, Got absolutely yeeted into the ban list soooo changed it to solemn strike for monster negate but like always you can switch this out for another cosmic cyclone.</li>  	<li>Monk of Tenyi is a Normal Monster to combo with the tenyi, Shaman is a good monster card especially the effect is has with the other wyrm and tenyi monsters which is why she's in here. Berserker legit cause why not lol.</li> </ul> Overall that's it if you made this far, Thank you for taking your time. Made this deck because we are in a pandemic and got inspired to make a virus deck. I know the deck is a joke but the real virus isn't please everyone be safe out there and please wear a mask. If you haven't gotten vaccinated please do, I can't force you to so if you don't want too that's up to you.  -Kish"

They can get out link and xyz monsters really quickly and can gain advantage off of it. The Inzektors have this fun gimmick where they can attach other Inzektor monsters to themself and gain strong effects off of it when they are on the field and sent to the graveyard. This works perfectly in a deck that loves to bring out link monsters which this deck does.  I added the Red eyes Dark Dragoon because the card is absolutely bs and can be brought out on turn 1 rather consistently thanks to Predeplant Verte Anaconda.

Add in some Dogmatika bs and you have a gross control deck. This can otk with the rail cannons which is rather simple. Just xyz summon Gustav Max and use its effect and then rank it up into Juggernaut Libre and attack twice. This is one of the strongest decks in the meta right now and has some amazing matchups.  You can use Skull Mieter instead of DD crow if you would like since they are both dark attribute and can therefore be used to bring out Winda. You can also replace one of the N'tss for an I:P if you would like. You can run Construct instead of Winda but I wouldn't recommend it because Winda is a strong floodgate that fits well in this deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Trap cards can counter most of the combos, if positioned correctly. Barrier Statue can also stop most of the combos from meta decks with types different from the Dark one. Gigantes doll can steal 2 of the opponent's monsters, and you can use those monsters as xyz materials for n. 88. I also added others rank 8 dark monsters to defend number 88 from effects.  This deck was designed only by me, trying to improve n. 88 true potential with lots of counters. Idk if it's a valuable meta deck, but I will test it on Master Duel, since it just came out.  If it's a very strong deck against the current meta, I'll update the category of this deck in ""Meta Deck"". Probably I'll also make some future changes, to make it more balanced and strong. I'll try my best."

I normally wouldn't suggest this deck to anyone at all, including Sky Strikers not because they're bad, but for various reasons I do not wish to state, especially if you already have a deck in mind in which you are confident enough that you can actually pilot competently enough, but the only reason as to why I do is simply because of how easy it is to obtain and pilot, and how it interacts with the low rarity staples in the game. Also, Eldlich is technically a Fusion strategy, except we don't really have the <a data-name=""Seven Cities of the Golden Land"">Seven Cities of the Golden Land</a> to fuse yet (correction, we do already have it, it's just that <a data-name=""Eldlich, the Mad Golden Lord"">Eldlich, the Mad Golden Lord</a> is another UR that you'd have to pull/craft, so unless you're dedicated to Eldlich, I don't recommend building using it), but anyway.  I made this list as free to play as possible, and with the assumption that you've already done the basic free to play routine at this point in the game.  <strong>Addressing the deck list:</strong>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> into x3 <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> = <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, alongside <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, are probably two of the most easily obtainable and most powerful staples in the game, hands down. You can easily unlock it buy either crafting a random UR/SR ""Forbidden"" or ""Darklord"" card to unlock the ""Deceitful Wings of Darkness"" Secret Pack, where you can farm it there by unlocking packs and get crafting materials. What this also allows you to do is to pivot into the Darklord strategy, if that interests you in any way, shape, or form, or just as an investment for future support/archetype releases that might have synergy with it, such as Despia.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Horn of Heaven"">Horn of Heaven</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> into x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> = Pretty self-explanatory. You can easily unlock <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> by either crafting a random UR/SR ""Parshath"" or ""Agent"" card to unlock the ""Guardians of the Sacred Sky"" Secret Pack, where you can farm it there by unlocking packs and get crafting materials. What this also allows you to do is to pivot into the Counter Fairies strategy, a classic control deck that focuses mainly on the small Fairy-type monsters that gain effects upon activating a Counter Trap, which also has great synergy with Eldlich. I have also made a list for that if it interests you in this link: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/counter-fairy-eldlich-master-duel/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/counter-fairy-eldlich-master-duel/</a></span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a> and x3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> = These two, you can actually decide to play together if you want, in any ratio you see fit.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> into x3 <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> = I'm actually on the fence between these two, because they both have their own strengths and weaknesses. The former being not minding getting discarded for <a data-name=""Eldlich"">Eldlich</a> or <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, and the latter essentially being used to either lock down a column from Spells or as a defensive tool going second. I'll leave this one up to your personal preference.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 61: Volcasaurus"">Number 61: Volcasaurus</a> into x1 <a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a> = Good enough boss monster with a non-destruction quick play interruption, while the former is a monster spot removal but worse.</span>  <strong>More budget options:</strong>  <span>• <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> (SR) - This is considered a budget option due to a play set of this being guaranteed to be available in the ""Magician of Pendulum"" Structure Deck. Buy with caution.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a>/<a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> (R) - Both monster interruptions that stay on the field. </span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Dark Core"">Dark Core</a> (R) - Outs monsters that cannot be destroyed by card effects but can still be targeted. Also a discard enabler.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a> (R) - Great against swarm and Pendulum decks, or just non-Link boss monsters that are pretty difficult to out.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Dust Tornado"">Dust Tornado</a> (R) - Back row removal and potential set up.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> (R) - Generic spot removal and discard enabler.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Ballista Squad"">Ballista Squad</a> (R) - Generic spot removal and enables Lightning Storm if you decide to play it.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Magic Jammer"">Magic Jammer</a>/<a data-name=""Magic Drain"">Magic Drain</a>/<a data-name=""Divine Wrath"">Divine Wrath</a> (R) - Generic Counter Traps that are also discard enablers.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Light-Imprisoning Mirror"">Light-Imprisoning Mirror</a>/<a data-name=""Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror"">Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror</a> (R) - Attribute related floodgates.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Trap Jammer"">Trap Jammer</a> (N) - Also a generic Counter Trap, could be nice on mirror matches.</span>  The extra deck is pretty self-explanatory being filled with either <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> targets or <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity </a>fodders. Make use of <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>, <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, and <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> as soon as you get hold of them. <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> can also be a cute tech, in case you run into <a data-name=""Eldlich"">Eldlich</a> mirror matches. That's pretty much everything there is to it."

Anyway, If u replace windwich engine with Enforcer package  also is ok if u have the budget. Both engines are killer. Personally i like the windwich engine because is not expensive and is working very well with both invoked or dogmatika engines.  About Maximus: Everyone using 1 copy of maximus (me also in the past) but that's wrong, Maximus x3 is the best. Normal summon whatever monster (even hand trap), summon almiraj - gardna - sp summon maximus - send in gy apcalone and ash dragon - set schism for winda - sp summon ecclesia in EP by ash dragon and add fleur in your hand. I mention that combo because the most of the people thinks Maximus is brick or bad draw, but is not.  About Windwich engine: Sp summon Windwich ice bell and use eff - sp summon glass bell and use eff - add snow bell and sp summon it from hand - summon wind pegasus using glass bell and ice bell - summon crystal wing using pegasus and snow bell. The same turn u can normal summon Aleister for Raidjin or normal summon ecclesia (search by nadir) to add fleur in hand. Note: if u have both Maximus and Ice Bell in hand then u have to choice between Maximus combo or windwich combo, if your choice is for Maximus then normal summon Ice Bell (or other monster) and summon Almiraj - Gardna - etc... With enforcer package u will not be able to choice between maximus combo or Enforcer except if u don't have other appropriate monster in hand for almiraj, that's why personally i like more windwich engine because i have choice and it doesn't play bricks.

The rest of the deck is just removal, negation, churning through the deck, and getting powerful fusion summons, including Last Warrior From Another Planet, who prevents summons.

As someone remembers, I tried yesterday to focus this deck on defending <strong>Number 88</strong> and winning with its effect, but I couldn't really find a good way to summon always him in the beginning of a duel; I'm not saying that it's a bad card, but it's just not so easy to summon in the first turns (and that's why I put him in the <strong>Side Deck</strong>).  So I decided to give more space to the other Gimmick Puppet numbers, such as <strong>c15</strong> and <strong>c40</strong>, because they can help you out to get rid of most of the opponent's card in the field. And to help them out some defenses are required:  -""<strong>Condolence Puppet</strong>"" grants to c15 and c40 to survive against cards as <em>Raigeki</em> (which is kind of popular in Master Duel);  -""<strong>Heavy Metal Raiders</strong>"" (the Field Spell) can keep in battle every g. puppet monster that you have in the field, which is kind of dope (idk why no one talked about this card already but whatever);  -""<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>"" and ""<strong>Broken Line</strong>"" can block most of the combos (I used those against a <em>Blue Eyes</em> deck and I was laughing my ass off);  -""<strong>Debunk</strong>"" can negate <em>Ash Blossom</em>'s effect, and that's cool;  -""<strong>Network Trap Hole</strong>"" can also block <em>Summon Combos</em>, especially the ones that use the <em>main deck</em> or the <em>GY</em>;  - ""<strong>Mythical Space Typhoon</strong>"" I think it's almost needed in every deck, can destroy a lot of annoying cards (especially <em>Field</em> ones);  -""<strong>Number 23</strong>"" and ""<strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</strong>"" are the best boys in this deck, they can negate effects and prevent the destruction of your cards by opponent card's effects.  I also kept ""<strong>Barrier Statue of the Abyss</strong>"" in this deck, because I find interesting his effect; I honestly discovered his existence some days ago, and for now I couldn't find a duel where this card saved me from enemy combos, so if this card keeps being useless, I'll decide to remove it from this deck, and maybe replace it with an another monster.  And as Rank-Up card, I think that ""<strong>Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force</strong>"" is the best choice among the others, because you can negate <em>all face-up card's effects</em> permanently, which is kind of sick, but at the same time this card could be your doom if you use it incorrectly, so think carefully when you should use it.  With those things said, I'll continue my research on creating the ultimate Gimmick Puppet Meta deck, and if I succed in my goal, I'll put this deck in the ""Meta"" category.

This deck also mainly focuses on it's  archetype ""<strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong>"" aka. ""<strong>Rose</strong>"".  So how do I use this deck?  First of all you have to know that the main engine of this archetype is to <strong>destroy</strong> the whole field of cards via <strong>card effects</strong> (for example: Black Rose Dragon/Ruddy Rose Dragon). To deal damage to your opponent, you have to special summon monsters from your <strong>Extra Deck</strong> or <strong>Graveyard</strong> such as <strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong> to activate it's effects, which allows the user to target one of the opponent's monster and to <strong>change it's atk to 0</strong> ... basicially a mix between <strong>destruction</strong> and <strong>damage dealing</strong>. In this case, the player has to summon <strong>Synchro Monsters</strong> (either from the Graveyard {by the effects of Blue Rose Dragon or Basal Rose Shoot/Black Garden} or from the Extra Deck {via. synchro summon or the effects of monsters such as Ruddyrose Dragon/Crossrose Dragon}).  It does not sound easy, right? Well the thing is, that this deck is kinda<em> outdated</em>, especially with only one way of negating effects (Ruddy Rose Dragon). So instead of showing you a way to play a meta deck, I will show you the probably fastest and easiest way of <em>summoning</em> destructive and fearless <strong>Monsters</strong>  Monster Cards: In this deck we use a mix of main deck monsters and extra deck monsters (especially main deck monsters as tuning materials) <ul>  	<li>Rose Dragons: mainly used as fast <strong>synchro materials</strong> and to <strong>search out</strong> supportive spells and traps (feat. the ""Rose"" archetype)</li>  	<li>Plant Monsters: used as <strong>synchro</strong> or<strong> link materials</strong>, also used as cards to either search out other plant monsters or to <strong>special summon plant tokens</strong> on the field</li> </ul> Spell Cards: <ul>  	<li>Quick-Play Spell Cards: mainly used to <strong>special summon</strong> several <strong>Rose Dragons</strong> (either from the hand or graveyard) or to search out possible <strong>extra deck materials</strong></li>  	<li>Field Spell Cards: mainly used to either <strong>boost up</strong> your <strong>Rose Synchro Dragon</strong> or to special summon it by <strong>tributing plant monsters</strong> on the field (they are in generell plant tokens)</li> </ul> Trap Cards: <ul>  	<li>mainly used to <strong>summon out plant tokens</strong> or to<strong> protect</strong> or your monsters <strong>by banishing them temporarily</strong></li> </ul> I hope that little description did help you to understand the function of this deck. The rest is either to train with or to modificate it."

Using ""Degenerate Circuit"" will prevent your opponent from Special Summoning any ""UA."" monsters by their own effects, since they need to return a ""UA."" monster to the hand, but cannot.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">See how you get on and have fun! this wont win you worlds but it will give you a surprising edge on some of the top meta decks and is great fun to play!</p>"

First and foremost the cards ""<a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>"" are normally available at 3 copies in the TCG, however Konami has taken the OCG's stance on these cards and limited them to 2 copies and 1 copy respectively. The hit to Magical Meltdown just makes seeing ""<a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>"" and thus the entire Invoked half of the deck more annoying and inconsistent, whereas the hit to ""<a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>"" greatly reduces consistency on the Dogmatika half of the deck as well as the deck's ability to break your opponent's board due to not being able to send ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>"" and start your plays.  Secondly, you may have noticed the ""<a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>"" package aiming to summon ""<a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a>"". <strong>This is probably bad, full stop</strong>. HOWEVER, it is very funny and the actually good target ""<a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>"" is currently not in Master Duel. While Dystopia's 1600 burn damage and 3800 ATK after the effect of ""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"" do help assemble lethal both in and out of the battle phase, the reality is that this deck doesn't need it and would much prefer the recurring body of DPE. A more standard Shaddoll package of ""<a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a>"" and cards like ""<a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon</a>"" is assuredly better, but Dystopia is funnier and thats the hill I choose to die on.  Third, the extra deck here is not optimized by any means, there is a strong argument to cut two of the Invoked Fusion Monsters besides ""Invoked Mechaba"" or ""Invoked Purgatrio"" to fit in two more copies of ""Elder Entity N'tss"". I've opted for the two additional Invoked targets ""Invoked Caliga"" and ""Invoked Magellanica"" entirely to take advantage of ""Invocation's"" ability to use opponent's graveyard monsters as material for their summon. For example, you can banish an opponent's one copy of ""<a data-name=""Zoodiac Drident"">Zoodiac Drident</a>"", their ""<a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>"", or even their ""<a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye"">Sky Striker Ace - Raye</a>"" so that if you're not able to end the game right then and their you won't have to deal with them the following turn. Magellanica is also has 3000 ATK for use with ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>"", though I like to think of this as a happy coincidence.  Next up, Hand Trap ratios. Master Duel is a super jank format best-of-one format with a banlist that looks like a pre-pandemic OCG list where someone just forgot about a few cards. Drytron, Adamancipator, Gem-Knight FTK*, Sky Striker, Thunder Dragon, Virtual World, Pendulum, Eldlich and <span><em><strong>so</strong></em></span> many more are better than we ever got to play them in the TCG and people are taking FULL advantage of it. As a result, I've opted for the hand traps you see before you, 3 pieces of main deck spell trap removal and 5 uniquely named hand traps, resulting in 13-16 pieces of generic interaction. The philosophy behind this is basically ""if my opponent opts to simply play through '<a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""'</a>, there has to be a punish for it eventually"", a lot of these decks are so cracked that you might need 2-3 pieces of interaction to even start contesting their board on either turn.  Lastly, some important things to note about weird interactions if you're new to the deck: <ul>  	<li>""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" and 'Maxx ""C""' conflict, you can activate both on the same turn to stop your opponent from adding cards from their deck to hand, but you will not get the draws from Maxx C due to Droll being a symmetric effect.</li>  	<li>The effects of ""Nadir Servant"", ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"" and ""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"" to lock you out of the extra deck only apply if the effects to search actually resolve, they can be used to bait out interaction, though if you're going first or have already cracked their board they should be used as late as possible.</li>  	<li>The Dogmatika extra deck lock prevents summoning from the extra deck, ""<a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>"" prevents special summoning in general, you can't use both parts of the deck on the same turn.</li>  	<li>On a largely empty board Aleister &gt; Almiraj &gt; Secure Gardna &gt; Invocation for Purgatrio represents a 2300-3300+ ATK piercer that can attack every monster (even if its summoned during the battle phase) and the 1k from Secure Gardna. Dystopia adds 1600 burn alongside 3800 if you're able to avoid using the destruction effect.</li>  	<li>There are strong cases to be made for playing ""<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>"" over ""<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>"" over ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>"".

It's a pretty popular and simple strategy with two basic game plans, either overwhelm your opponent with simple card advantage through your constant Invoked plays per turn, or stun your opponent using the Mekk-Knight lock, which this deck can absolutely turbo out with no problem.  The Invoked engine does not need any further introduction, everybody knows it by now due to the countless times people have Normal Summoned <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> in this game since its release. What's great about this strategy is you can easily pivot from one strategy to another, depending on whichever engine your opponent decides to interrupt.

I am 100% free to play and have found that it is extremely versatile and fun. It can go 1st and set up a recursive board with a decent floodgate (El Shaddoll Winda) with some good interruptions (Machaba, Handtraps, Super Poly, Fusion Summoning on their turn, etc). Going 2nd if your handtraps are not enough to stop them from board building you have plenty of options to out their board while setting up your own. The decks biggest weakness is Eldlich and True Draco; usually because they don't care about Winda and they can usually floodgate you out of the game. Both match-ups are still winnable.  Overall the deck is an easier one to pick up for those who are newer to a modern format or are coming from something like Duel Links while still offering plenty of complexity and a good learning curve for those looking for something that isn't just 'Monkey Flip'. If you have any comments or suggestions I would love to read them.  &nbsp;  Card Explanations -  Invoked Package - Best normal summon in the game? If you can, get out Machaba first to protect the rest of your plays. Otherwise, the entire package is usually amazing Ash/negation bate. With such a tight extra deck Purgatrio might seem like an odd choice but it closes out games and clears boards in a deck that often has trouble doing both otherwise. Hence the reason for the Almiraj into Gardna combo. Machaba, importantly, can also be summoned in under 5 summons to avoid <em>The Rock</em>.  Shaddolls: The ratio's can always be played around and tweaked with. I have settled with what you see now with much experimentation. You usually want some in your hand to get more fusion summons and a negate from Shekhinaga/Machaba. Worth noting that the Ariel and Dragon can both be used on the opponents turn to mess up your opponents plays. Incarnation in the grave also turns any of your Shaddoll's flip effects into quick effects. Getting Schism is often a priority because an El Shaddoll Winda and/or an Apkallone on your opponents turn will often either end their turn or severely hinder it.  &nbsp;  Hand Traps: Generally, run what you have and what you like. However, you need some lights for Construct and an Earth for Shekhinaga. The Ash for Purgatrio is also kind of funny.  &nbsp;  Spellbook of Knowledge: Pot of Desires is fine, but I like Knowledge. Feel free to try either. The other pots are probably not an option when you are too likely to banish something important. You can also replace them with Upstart Goblin's."

Though they have other effects, the Main Deck monsters share a common effect of banishing themselves from the Graveyard in order to search each other/their Spell/Trap Cards out or place each other/their Spell/Trap Cards in the Graveyard. Their Spell and Trap Cards also activate from the Graveyard in order to Special Summon more ""The Phantom Knights"", including multiple <a title=""Pseudo-Trap Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Pseudo-Trap_Monster"">Pseudo-Trap Monsters</a>. These plays are meant to set up the <a title=""Xyz Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Xyz_Summon"">Xyz Summon</a> of <a title=""Rank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Rank"">Rank</a> 2-4 <a title=""DARK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/DARK"">DARK</a> <a title=""Xyz Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Xyz_Monster"">Xyz Monsters</a> and Link summon of <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Rusty_Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, supporting them with stat-increasing and protection effects.  In particular, the Level 4 monsters generally support the Level 3 monsters, who are the backbone of the Deck, being used to Summon <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Break_Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a>, an incredibly powerful Rank 3 popular in many Decks for its effect to target and destroy 1 card on each field. <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Ragged_Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a> can give a DARK Xyz Monster Summoned using it 1000 extra ATK (taking Break Sword to 3000). It can also banish itself from your <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard"">GY</a> to send any other Phantom Knights card from your Deck to the GY, setting up your other plays. <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Ancient_Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> can grant any other DARK monster 800 extra ATK/DEF while it is on the field, and acts as the searcher for the other The Phantom Knights cards in the Deck when banished from the GY. Finally, and most importantly, <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Silent_Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> can Special Summon itself from your hand if you control another Phantom Knight, setting up your Xyz Summon, and can search any Phantom Knights Spell/Trap when banished.  In a dedicated Phantom Knights Deck, one of Break Sword's most terrifying effects is triggered when it is destroyed (most often by its own effect), whereupon it revives 2 The Phantom Knights from your GY and raises their Level by 1. While this does not allow you to go back into Break Sword, you can then follow up with <a title=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Rebellion_Xyz_Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a>, a powerful monster for defeating your opponent in battle. More importantly, it detaches both its materials for its effect, allowing you to use Cloak or Boots to search and use <a title=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights%27_Rank-Up-Magic_Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>, a unique <a title=""Rank-Up"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Rank-Up"">Rank-Up</a> card that also attaches itself to the monster you Xyz Summon and can make any DARK Xyz Monster, but the monster you Summon it onto must have no materials. This means The Phantom Knights are the only deck with an easy way to Summon the terrifying <a title=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Requiem_Xyz_Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>, a monster that can permanently steal all the ATK of 1 of your opponent's monsters, and negate their monster effects while reviving Xyz Monsters. The Launch can also banish itself from your GY to give your DARK Xyz Monsters extra materials, so setting up and maintaining Dark Requiem is one of this Deck's core goals.  Another important part of this Deck is its wide variety of on-archetype Trap Cards. As mentioned, many are Pseudo-Trap Monsters, some Summoning in response to a direct attack, others at any time. Two of the most important are <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Lost_Vambrace"">The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace</a>, which provides the only easy means of Summoning <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Cursed_Javelin"">The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin</a>, and <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Shade_Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>, which has proved exceedingly popular for its effect to be activated the turn it is Set if you have no Traps in your GY, suppling a free DARK Warrior to any field. Of the other Traps, <a title=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Knights%27_Fog_Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> can negate the effects of a targeted monster and stop it attacking, but it also prevents you attacking it, <a title=""Phantom Knights' Sword"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Knights%27_Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a> gives any monster 800 ATK as an Equip-like effect, and can destroy itself to protect the monster, while <a title=""Phantom Knights' Wing"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Knights%27_Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a> is a Normal Trap that gives a monster 500 ATK and prevents the monster being destroyed once that turn. All three share a self-banish from GY effect to revive any The Phantom Knight but banishing it when it leaves the field, encouraging you to Xyz Summon with it to pass the rulings (as cards on the field becoming materials for an Xyz monster are not considered leaving the field and when they are detached, they are only considered as being <b>sent</b> to the GY, not <b>leaving the field</b>).  The archetype also works fairly well with <a title=""Link Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Link_Summon"">Link Summoning</a>. With access to powerful monsters like <a title=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Isolde,_Two_Tales_of_the_Noble_Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</a> and the <a title=""Borrel"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Borrel"">Borrel</a> series of Link-4s, Phantom Knights can set up future space for Xyz Summons with ease. With their own <a title=""Link Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Link_Monster"">Link Monster</a>, <a title=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_Knights_of_Rusty_Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, able to the monsters to the GY and Set the Traps from Deck at the same time while destroying an extra card when a DARK Xyz Monster is Summoned, the Deck has some terrifying control and removal power, culminating in, as ever, Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon.  Finally, in competitive play, the archetype is viewed as being too small to form a stand-alone Deck, so is normally paired with another Deck, normally also one that focuses on Rank 3s and DARKs. Both <a title=""Burning Abyss"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Abyss"">Burning Abyss</a> and <a title=""Danger!"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Danger!"">Danger!</a> have shown strong synergy with this strategy in this way, and the so-called ""PK-Fire"" Deck was one of the main meta Decks in 2016. Another popular combination is with <a title=""Artifact"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Artifact"">Artifacts</a>. This is due to their unique effects of setting themselves as spells, thus making the Phantom Knights' effect of destroying their own cards very useful with the Artifacts' play-style of summoning themselves and activating negative effects for the opponent when destroyed by card effects.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <p><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/31uuqUzZyhE"">https://youtu.be/31uuqUzZyhE</a></p>"

For climbing ranked I would recommend the Maxx C deck as many of the combo decks you will verse in latter will be heavy on summons and you get free draw fuel, the Nibiru version of the deck is also good against combo heavy decks but it is less consistent as drawing a nibiru and not activating is basically just a dead card in your hand (the nibiru twister aims to solve that by using twister to pop spell/trap and discard a dead card.) Most decks in latter will choose to go first if they have the option, so playing any of the decks besides the ""Sky Striker going first"" deck will be enough to get you to Plat and consistently win, though even when I was testing the deck in plat lobbies I still won the majority of my duels with the ""going first"" deck. (The deck builds I am referring are <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/3gk4ZLJ"">here</a>)  &nbsp;  Pot of desires is just a free plus 1 and even if it gets ashed or negated it is a free spell in the grave to start our engine (not to mention that if you get the effect off you get a gigantic draw 2 which is made even stronger because of how sky striker plays). metalfoes engine is a very strong cycle through the deck, activate foolish burial goods, dump metalfoes, activate metalfoes, now you get a free draw and a free spell in grave with neutral card advantage. Plus desires and foolish are good for bainting out hand traps (specifically ash blossom). lightning storm is a potential brick card so I don't run it. run space typhoon to pop your own field spell card and get a free special summon of Raye on field, now that you have ray on field you can normal summon an ash or effect veiler and go into your needle fiber, access code talker combo, or save your normal for something else. space typhoon also useful for popping opponents cards if they have something like a skill drain which literally kills the deck. you can also combo space typhoon to destroy the cynet field spell and recycle Kagari (which I don't have to explain to you why that is very strong.) I dont run cosmic because none of the combos mentioned above would be possible because the card banishes instead of destroys. twin twist is a good pick as you can pop 2 of opponent back row or pop 1 and then 1 of your own for the same combos mentioned earlier accept sometimes you don't have a card that you are willing to toss. There are even more crazy interactions the deck can do. The amount of free extenions you get by special summoning off of all the spells and holding your normal summon makes the deck very resilliant and able to recover from a bad start.  Infinite Impermanence is literally one of the strongest cards in the game. The deck is a going second deck, imperm is one of the strongest going second cards, and even if you go first imperm gets an even stronger effect.  &nbsp;"

I'm pretty sure I have never smoked anything but it's something that's been bugging my mind for quite some time now, a deck that strangely enough is actually better when blinding second than going first, Invoked Salamangreat.  ""Why play this deck? What's wrong with you?""  Well you see, there are actually strategies in Yu-Gi-Oh that are perfect when it comes to smokescreening strategies, mostly being the best decks unsurprisingly enough, mainly because they all either are not Normal Summon reliant like Lyrilusc, Tri-Brigade, etc. or they provide other strategies the missing component, be it an easily splashable engine that's small but explosive enough and does not xeno-lock you from making plays and/or a Normal Summon engine that provides a one card combo (usually) to test the waters and snipe potential hand traps. If that sounds familiar with you, then that's exactly what Invoked is meant to do in this list.  ""So, what's this deck's game plan?""  It's no secret that people love wasting their <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>s, and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>s upon <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>'s Normal Summon, but that still does not answer the question ""why mash these two together up?"". The reasoning is simpler than you might be thinking, and that being <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> can be linked off to <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> or can be used as a discard fodder for <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>, perfect for hands where you drew the <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> (in which you run three of for maximum tilter) and that's why we have two normal summons in this deck, the other one being <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a>. There are actually some hands that are so good, that sending Aleister to the GY with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> can be an optimal play. Your main boss monster here is actually not Invoked Mechaba, since he's pretty useless going second, and just stands there going 1st since <a data-name=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a> locks you out of monster effects the turn its effect is activated, except for FIRE monsters, that's why he's actually the weakest link in this deck and would be much better off later in the mid game grind as a defensive tool while you're recycling resources with your Salamangreat monsters.  ""How do you end games with this?""  Four ways. Out-resource your opponent, <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> and/or <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> beatdown, or <a data-name=""Invoked Augoiedes"">Invoked Augoeides</a> control. That's it.  One thing to note is that the only mandatory hand trap here is <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, since your Salamangreats can recycle it easily. The other three can be a flex spot for anything, and the reason why I'm playing <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> is because I decided to use <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> instead of <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>, otherwise I would've used <a data-name=""Invoked Magellanica"">Invoked Magellanica</a> or <a data-name=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a> and two <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>s instead. So yeah, that's pretty much the deck. The only problem with this is that, it can be expensive especially if you haven't invested in either Salamangreat or Invoked yet, since you need four UR cards in here, three being the <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a> and one being the Salamangreat Almiraj. We're not running <a data-name=""Salamangreat Heatleo"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a> in this list because the extra deck is tight enough."

Feel free to use Skill Drain instead or add other cards ,A relatively inexpensive deck that can contend with the meta. For those who want to spend the least amount of CP for Ultra Rare cards (Terraforming is essential in my opinion). You may also add Imperial Order and Vanity's too if you wish to spend 60 more CP for them.

Are you tired of seeing these Lyrilusc/Zoodiac/Tri-Brigades in the ladder? Have you had enough of asking yourself ""what have I done wrong"" after seeing Earth Machines continue doing all these stuff after being Ashed? Do you feel vindicated by the current Master Duel meta game and in a desperate need of absolute form of retaliation so bad, calling it a ""war crime"" would be an understatement? Well my friend, I came here to you to provide you something that not only you might enjoy, but your opponent is guaranteed not to. We are erasing ""fun"" in our vocabularies nowadays, ladies and gentlemen because I am here to present you, Counter Fairy Eldlich.  If that sounds like the most disgusting name of a deck you've heard, then good, because that's what it intends to do. But before everything else, I wanna preface this with a caution that this is NOT a cheap deck list.  <strong>The first ""unfun"" part of the deck list:</strong>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> and x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> -</span> The Solemn brigade, emissaries of unfun are absolutely mandatory for this deck, regardless of your overall ratio. You could make room for a <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> or two if you like.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> -</span> Generic hand trap, but the real power move here is Normal Summon Ash, Synchro with Ash and Conquistador/Huaquero into <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>/<a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Constellar Pleiades"">Constellar Pleiades</a> -</span> Generic Rank 5 with Quick Play spot removal.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a> -</span> Cowboy's bigger brother.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Crimson Knight Vampire Bram"">Crimson Knight Vampire Bram</a> -</span> Great Zombie-type Xyz monster that floats upon destruction and can steal monsters from your opponent's GY by detaching an Xyz material. You can also revive him with your <a data-name=""Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine"">Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine</a>.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Crimson Blader"">Crimson Blader</a> - <span>To lock your opponent down from Special Summoning high Level monsters upon destroying a monster by battle during their next turn. </span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Scrap Dragon"">Scrap Dragon</a> - <span>Generic one for one spot removal. Can be used to turn off your <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> if not needed anymore.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a> - <span>A funny card. Not necessary but nice to have. Decent beater, makes OTKs easy, and offers a bit of protection to your Conquistadors/Huaqueros from battle.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Vylon Disigma"">Vylon Disigma</a> - <span>A classic Rank 4 monster that has two forms of removal, one is a targeting, non-destruction effect, and the other is a non-targeting destruction effect. Great with your Fairies.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Bountiful Artemis"">Bountiful Artemis</a> -</span> Not once per turn draw power. We also have <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a> at three, btw.</span>  <span><span>• x2 <a data-name=""Power Angel Valkyria"">Power Angel Valkyria</a> -</span> Your main searcher.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Guiding Ariadne"">Guiding Ariadne</a> -</span> The main reason you're still alive after all that Solemn negations.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath"">Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath</a> -</span> A fantastic boss monster in this deck. It pierces for damage, it can Special Summon itself, it searches. Standard for Counter Fairies, for one more reason later.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Minerva, Scholar of the Sky"">Minerva, Scholar of the Sky</a> -</span> your secondary beat stick that can also be a conditional searcher.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Meltiel, Sage of the Sky"">Meltiel, Sage of the Sky</a> -</span> your secondary way to recover that can also be a conditional interruption.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""The Sanctum of Parshath"">The Sanctum of Parshath</a> -</span> A mandatory three of card. This is your only way to recover your Solemn traps and Fairy monsters from the GY, and also provides additional protection to your Set Spell/Trap cards, but the most important thing is it turns on the other effects of your Fairy monsters because it also counts as ""<a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a>"". Protect it with your life, literally.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> -</span> Because we're running <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>, <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, and <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> in this build.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> -</span> Sleeper staple in this format. Great against boss monsters that cannot be targeted and/or destroyed on decks that only utilizes one monster type, or for just straight up stealing them.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Ultimate Providence"">Ultimate Providence</a> -</span> Another reason why we're running a lot of Spells despite also using <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>, because pardon my language but fuck them <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> (even though not a lot of people are running them, surprisingly enough), <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>s, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, and <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>s.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Rebirth of Parshath"">Rebirth of Parshath</a> -</span> This is why we're running only one <a data-name=""Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath"">Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath</a>, <a data-name=""Celestial Knightlord Parshath"">Celestial Knightlord Parshath</a>, and <a data-name=""Avenging Airknight Parshath"">Avenging Airknight Parshath</a>. It's a free optional summon upon negation. There's literally no reason not to choose to summon one, unless your field is full.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> -</span> If I see you chaining this to <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>, I swear to God I'm gonna break your fucking kneecaps. No seriously, fantastic Counter Trap.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Divine Punishment"">Divine Punishment</a> -</span> It's a conditional omni-negate Counter Trap that does not require a discard.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> -</span> For Eldlich mirrors and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> -</span> Standard for decks built around making your opponent not have fun as much as possible. There's no better feeling than flipping this up to a Sky Striker player in a best of one format. (RIP btw KEKW)</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> and x3 <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a> -</span> Because we're playing monki flip anyway, who cares about Special Summoning during your turn. The pot can be anything of your choice though.</span>  The second ""unfun"" part of the decklist is just Eldlich, and I think that's pretty understandable and everyone who plays Master Duel can agree to that.  So yeah. That's it. Have fun committing crimes against humanity on the ladder."

Let's get on to it.  The original game plan, as per usual: Protect the floodgates.  <strong>The non-Tenyi cards:</strong>  <span>• <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> - This is not mandatory, but a fantastic option if you can afford it since it sets up your graveyard as well. You don't have to have this card early on, for the mean time, more copies of Tenyi monsters will do, or even <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> if you prioritized obtaining them first.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a> - This is a great one of for your Synchro 7/8/<a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> set ups, or just general Wyrm link plays.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Ryu Okami"">Ryu Okami</a> - This card is a hidden gem among Rares. Had I realized earlier that this was a Wyrm, I would've used it sooner. This card kills the extra deck of combo decks. I actually wanna test this with Dogmatika as soon as I can afford the engine for a full extra deck murder build.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing"">Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</a>/<a data-name=""Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing"">Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing</a> - Great Wyrm Level 7/8 monsters, respectively. Helps you go second.</span>  <strong>Other non-Tenyi techs that might interest you:</strong>  <span>• <a data-name=""Buster Dragon"">Buster Dragon</a> - This card is hilarious. If your opponent is not playing Kaijus and they're using a type centered archetype that aren't Dragons, they're gone. Just sit with this card in Defense Position behind your <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> and you're good.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> - This card is the reason why I've been debating on playing more copies of <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a>. It's a once per turn Spell/Trap negate, and this deck can make use of more protection.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> - This card is busted as fuck. Imagine being able to recycle all of your banished <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a> during your opponent's Standby Phases, while sitting on a <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a>.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> - You're playing three copies of <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>, which are free to obtain. It's also a non-targeting, non-destruction removal.</span>  So there it is, my pure Tenyi build. I've had lots of fun playing this deck casually, sometimes it even makes me wish that I was back at rookie just to have fun climbing with it again. I hope you do find pleasure in playing it as well, if you happen to do so."

Well see, the problem with Monarchs is that you don't exactly have a good turn one play, if you don't have access to either <a data-name=""Thestalos the Mega Monarch"">Thestalos the Mega Monarch</a> or <a data-name=""Erebus the Underworld Monarch"">Erebus the Underworld Monarch</a> to snipe your opponent's hand, <a data-name=""Zaborg the Mega Monarch"">Zaborg the Mega Monarch</a> to mess up your opponent's Extra Deck, or <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> to set up for the next turn, hopefully, and the problem with Eldlich is that it does not have a good turn two play, unless you've established tempo during your turn one set up, provided it doesn't get messed up by your opponent during their turn, which is highly unlikely that they won't, so I thought to myself ""maybe I should try splashing these two together, test it, and maybe find some incidental synergies between the two archetypes"", and so I did, and so I found! It turns out that both <a data-name=""The Prime Monarch"">The Prime Monarch</a>, <a data-name=""Conquistador of the Golden Land"">Conquistador of the Golden Land</a>, and <a data-name=""Huaquero of the Golden Land"">Huaquero of the Golden Land</a> are all treated as Level 5 LIGHT monsters on the field, giving this deck access to a neat Rank 5 toolbox in the Extra Deck, or Rank 8s as follow up considering the fact that all Mega Monarchs are Level 8 monsters, and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> is a Level 3 Tuner, providing access to Level 8 Synchro plays as well. Also if you didn't know, you can Special Summon <a data-name=""Erebus the Underworld Monarch"">Erebus the Underworld Monarch</a> using your Eldlixirs, if you already have an <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> on board because apparently, he's a Zombie type monster. And so, here's the list breakdown.</span>  <strong>The one of Monarchs:</strong>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Granmarg the Mega Monarch"">Granmarg the Mega Monarch</a>/<a data-name=""Mobius the Mega Monarch"">Mobius the Mega Monarch</a></span> - You'll usually set them up with <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> against back row heavy decks, depending on whoever you needs the most or who's available.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Thestalos the Mega Monarch"">Thestalos the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This is one of the greatest turn one set ups you could have, especially if you already have an <a data-name=""Ehther the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther the Heavenly Monarch</a> for the next turn, or an Eldlich setup ready. Not a lot of cards has effects that provide access to hand information, and that's what makes Thestalos important.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Raiza the Mega Monarch"">Raiza the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This card is the first half of your second strongest disruptions (not necessarily weaker), being able to stack a card on the field on top of the deck and recycle a card on either GY to the deck. Sure, it does target, but it does not destroy, and if that card so happened to be an Extra Deck monster, your opponent would have to do all the work to bring out that monster again, but they might not even get another shot in doing so.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Caius the Mega Monarch"">Caius the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This is the other half of your second strongest disruption, the bane of DARK attribute monsters, and the reason as to why this is arguably stronger than Raiza, is because sure it does need to target a card, but it banishes the card and inflicts a 1000 damage to your opponent, and if it so happened to be a DARK monster, you get to banish all copies of that card from anywhere. Also, if you tributed a DARK monster for his summon, in which you have more than plenty of, optimally during your opponent's turn through <a data-name=""Escalation of the Monarchs"">Escalation of the Monarchs</a>, you get to target TWO cards instead. That's six DARK main deck monsters banished maximum. And guess what, DARK attribute is one of if not the most popular attribute in the game, alongside LIGHT.</span>  <span><span>• x1 <a data-name=""Zaborg the Mega Monarch"">Zaborg the Mega Monarch</a></span> - This is, what I would say, your strongest disruption relative to today's meta game in Master Duel for one simple reason, and that is he gets to mess up with your opponent's Extra Deck, and in this current format, we have a lot of meta decks that rely heavily on one of Extra Deck monsters. Sure, his effect requires you to have tributed a LIGHT monster in order for it to be activated, but you've got a lot of in-archetype LIGHT monsters, and guess what, <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> is a LIGHT attribute monster, and so are your Golden Land Trap cards. And you do not have to pop Zaborg himself, if your opponent has a LIGHT monster that can be targeted and destroyed, and so happened to have a higher Level than Zaborg, you can destroy that monster instead, and again, much like in Caius' case, LIGHT attribute is one of the most popular attributes in the game, alongside DARK.</span>  <strong>""Why use Xyz monsters?""</strong>  <span>So, here's the thing. Eldlich is a resource manage focused archetype, and so are Monarchs. <a data-name=""Pantheism of the Monarchs"">Pantheism of the Monarchs</a> being at three significantly makes it faster than back when it had it at 1, and this is where we discuss mirror matches and tempo control. There is only one rule that resource focused control decks follow when it comes to facing each other, and that is ""it's not about who gets to win sooner, it's about who runs out of gas later"", and that's exactly what your Xyz monsters provide. Not only do they provide additional interruptions and bodies on board, but they also act as a way to slow down the pace of your deck while applying enough pressure by holding your Golden Land traps, your <a data-name=""The Prime Monarch"">The Prime Monarch</a>s, and your Monarch monsters themselves as Xyz materials. It's fine if you don't get to activate your Conquistadors and Huaqueros in your GY this turn, you've got an established board while being able to interrupt your opponent through other interactions, and when all else fails, this is why we play <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>. He is the failsafe of this deck. He gets to recover any of your banished resources while he's on the field once during your opponent's Standby Phases, and he gets to recycle himself and another card on either GY back to the deck. I'm almost tempted to run <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> in this deck, if not only for the fact that I have to use my Extra Deck.</span>  <strong>Discussing the other Extra Deck stuff:</strong>  • <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> – <span>Great monster with a non-destruction form of interruption. Can get really out of hand easily.</span>  • <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a> – <span>He’s just here because he’s a Level 8 Zombie Synchro you get for free. He’s a decent beat stick that can attack under <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a>.</span>  • <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> – <span>I’ve discussed this card already in my previous guides, there’s a reason why he’s limited and will most likely gonna stay as such. He recycles your banished Monarch, Eldlixir, and Golden Land Spells/Traps, or even any monster banished by your opponent once during each of your opponent’s Standby Phases. He also can rip a card out of your opponent’s hand at Quick Effect speed.</span>  • <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</a> – <span>Now THIS needs a bit more explaining. I have known but never really looked into this card intensively, until now that I’ve been building decks in Master Duel and have been searching for good Xyz monsters, and I told myself “Why run <a data-name=""Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"">Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon</a>, a once per turn spot removal, not even at Quick Effect speed when you can just run this instead, considering the fact that he can protect your LIGHT monsters, and that includes <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, from targeting effects, and Eldlich himself already has an effect that protects him from being destroyed, which both lasts until the end of your opponent’s next turn?” Also, not to mention the fact that because you’re playing Monarchs, you get access to a neat Rank 8 engine, and that is why we’re running <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, which by the way, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</a> can recycle from the graveyard, if opponent happens to out it.</span>  • <a data-name=""Crimson Knight Vampire Bram"">Crimson Knight Vampire Bram</a> – <span>This card, I just recently discovered and has actually made me update all of my Eldlich lists just to include it because he’s actually crazy good for Eldlich. He’s a Rank 5 Xyz monster that only requires Zombies, which should be pretty easy for you to make, that can float upon being destroyed in general. Also, he can steal monsters on your opponent’s graveyard by just detaching 1 Xyz material. I’d even say he’s a staple in every Extra Deck Eldlich build.</span>  • <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a> – <span>Here is where the jank comes to play. We’re running two Link 2 monsters, including <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, that’s why I decided to go with <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> instead of <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, since he offers more protection. Avramax’ effect states that he can’t be targeted by card effects, and your opponent cannot target other monsters for attacks, except himself if he’s Link Summoned, which Masquerena enables. <a data-name=""Shark Fortress"">Shark Fortress</a>’ effect also states that your opponent cannot target monsters for attacks, except itself. Now what do you get if you have two monsters that practically does the same thing? I don’t know if you’re familiar with this interaction but it’s practically like having two face-up <a data-name=""Command Knight"">Command Knight</a>s or <a data-name=""Solar Flare Dragon"">Solar Flare Dragon</a>s on the field except they both taunt attacks, not diverting it away as the previously stated two does, and also, if you plan on using the Masquerena + Avramax package on a Synchro deck and you can Synchro Summon a Level 7 monster, there is a way to also do this but better, with <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>. It’s absolutely janky and I love it.</span>  This deck is just wonderful. I am a Fusion strategy enjoyer, but I do appreciate decks like Monarchs in particular as well, due to its nature of it requires the pilot to pay close attention to their and their opponent's resources as well, and that's what I loved about most Fusion strategies too. But anyway, I know this isn't a cheap deck to build either, but if you happen to have the resources to build or test it, or even improve it, give it a shot. That's all."

But this deck has a lot of different effects to remember and like many archetypes in the game it doesn't have much to go on, either you play that way or don't even try to use this deck. My goal is to demonstrate that you can use this deck in different ways and take advantage of the different effects of the cards to make the best choices and even surprise your opponent who most likely underestimates @Ignister and the different play lines possible to do as I present next.  Comments on cards and interactions important to remember: (detail: I call <a data-name=""Achichi"">Achichi</a> = Fire, <a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> = Light, <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> = Dark, <a data-name=""Bururu"">Bururu</a> = Wind, <a data-name=""Doshin"">Doshin</a> = Earth, <a data-name=""Hiyari"">Hiyari</a> = Water, <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> = Towers, <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> is a way of saying I'm using the Dark Templar effect, <a data-name=""A. I. Land"">A. I. Land</a> = Field)  Fire you can do in the Damage Step and that way you don't take battle damage. It synergizes you with @Ignister's LINK-3 Fire that you should know because there are strange situations that you can use this to your advantage to destroy your LINK-3 and it triggers eff to destroy an opponent's monster (only if destroyed by card effect and not by battle) not to mention that it will return to the field in the next Standby Phase after being destroyed (here this effect activates even if it is destroyed by battle). That way you can catch someone unaware and take out cards like <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> from field easily.  Using Water @Ignister allows you to play after taking <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> for accessing <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a>. Going second these cards help to kill the opponent with <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a>. But as it is not searchable by <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> for me it is best not to use it. Using Water usually gives you access to <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> when Tributing <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> and he enters the field to go straight and make the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and leave him Unaffected.  The good thing about <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> is that you force <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> early because when you do <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> he is forced to chain Nibiru to Gatchiri, but this same play can be done with <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> and you don't lose your <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> so soon keeping it in Extra Deck. Even because the push you make will be to go to the 3k atk Towers after that would be the result of the combo playing around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> and leaving Dark Templar in the Extra Deck.  Earth @Ignister is searchable and helps Accesscode and play after opponent disruptions.  You can use <a data-name=""Cynet Mine"">Cynet Mine</a> to send <a data-name=""A. I. Land"">A. I. Land</a> to the GY and that way you play around in <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> interaction. <a data-name=""A. I. Contact"">A. I. Contact</a> can be added back to the hand with <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> so you always draw three cards every turn in the Grind Game demonstrating the importance of having this card available.  <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> is for playing after taking <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> but I think <a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a> is much more important in the extra deck than this card. This spot could be the third Dark Infant and Update Jammer spot. A curiosity is that <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> is an excellent out of <a data-name=""Avramax"">Avramax</a> because you negate his effects during the Damage Step and with that you can take him out in battle.  The second <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> is essential in the grind game being indispensable and much more important to have 2 of it in the Extra Deck than 2 <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a>.  Going second you can with the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> after destroying the opponent's monster give <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> in Damage Step and Main Phase 2 go straight to TOWERS playing around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> if the opponent doesn't notice this move in Main Phase 1 or if you can do it the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> being your 4th summon which is not impossible in a simplified gamestate. To play around <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> with Dark Templar you can simply <strong>threaten Battle Phase</strong> and that way it already forces you to use it if you don't guarantee to do <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> on M2.  Xyz <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> allows you to add Light @Ignister to the hand with ROTA. It also helps break field and OTK.  <a data-name=""A. I. dle Reborn"">A. I. dle Reborn</a> effect of adding Spells/Traps in Grind Game is very important to remember because it is the difference between winning and losing. <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> works the same way as <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> to make <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> combo so if you can add and resolve the <a data-name=""A. I. ​​Contact"">A. I. ​​Contact</a> then do that instead of adding A. I. Meet You which is not needed as you already have A. I. Reborn that makes the combo happen anyway.  Techoplay: <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> can be used from the field to Bounce opponent's cards after something of yours is destroyed. Another thing to know is that if it triggers an effect when your monster is destroyed by battle, this effect will be <strong>activated during the Damage Step</strong> which avoids being negated by several cards in the game because in the Damage Step you can only activate cards that negate activation of effects and not the effect of the card so <a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a> for example cannot be used but <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> can be used by negating Activation of effects. <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> with the use of more than one <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> spell allows you to loop him back in backrow matches and destroy cards every turn. Even under <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> you can Reborn him and use the effect and cl2 use <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> to Tribute him and get back on the field and that way you can destroy the backrow. <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> banning itself also destroys <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>. This move is also a good one to make if you want to play around <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a>.  <a data-name=""TA. I. Strike"">TA. I. Strike</a> is a way to take out annoying floodgates from the field with your main deck monsters like <a data-name=""Inspector Boarder"">Inspector Boarder</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> is another way for you to take <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> out of the field because when the opponent declares an ATK you can simply negate the ATK and on your turn with her 2300atk take her out in the Battle Phase. This is relevant to the point that you have to realize that in situations of passing with <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> you bring Dark and use Dark eff to add <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> to the hand just to be able to negate an Atk and it enters the field helping you to survive and take tough monsters on the way back.  Synchro 7 <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum"">Cyberse Quantum</a> allows you to have more chances for TOWERS to survive by passing it from the end board instead of doing Wind Pegasus.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Differences between each Starter is basically in the first half of the combo which I say is how you arrive at the following gamestate: <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> + <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> + <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a>/<a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> = Fire/Light/A. I. Meet You always end up arriving at this part of the combo and from then on it will be the same for everyone what to do next to get to TOWERS.  Place the URL continuation on the duelingbook site after .com/  /////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 1: Fire/Light/A. I. Meet You/Cynet Mine 1 Card Combo (TOWERS 5k ATK - Not Recommended)  Example starting with Light from Starter: replay?id=621416-35837137 Gamestate: Towers (5k ATK) + Field /in Hand: A. I. Meet You /in GY: Wind Pegasus + <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 2: 1 Card Combo (Towers 4k ATK - Most Recommended)  If you do <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> first after <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> you can get <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> very early in the combo which is better in most cases than waiting for the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> effect to wear off to do Wind Pegasus. This is good for having the <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> still in the Extra Deck for turn 3 to do OTK play.  Example starting with Fire from Starter: replay?id=621416-35878853 Gamestate: Towers (4k ATK) + Field /in Hand: A. I. Meet You /in GY: Wind Pegasus + <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 3: How to make TOWERS without going through the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a>? (Towers 3k ATK - SAFE ROUTE)  Example starting with <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> from Starter: replay?id=621416-35879497 Gamestate: Towers (3k ATK) + A. I. Reborn + Field /in Hand: Fire /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card) Opponent's Turn: A. I. Reborn summon Dark and eff Add Fire (Follow Up)  Advantages of this combo: If you take <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>/<a data-name=""Impermanence"">Impermanence</a> at this point in <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> you simply summon another extender and go to play <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and manage to end up with 4k ATK TOWERS the same way. If you take <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> it's good because you already have guaranteed Fire and <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> from Follow Up in your hand which means having guaranteed plays on the way back. This play line happens a lot to do Towers this way because even if your starting hand is 2 Fire + Earth you can do <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> knowing this <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> Route. And if you do <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> to add Wind you can still send Dark to recover Follow Up or Negate to have a better chance of Towers surviving. In summary this is the best move possible to make with the deck without using <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> to play around hand traps in the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> because it doesn't matter if Towers will be 3k ATK or 4k ATK and yes the important thing is to get to your win condition 1 turn and having defenses for Towers to survive and this is very relevant and brings you closer to victory than <strong>losing to an Impermanence/Veiler/Belle/Nibiru in the Dark Templar</strong> effect. I'm not kidding when I say that the number of times @Ignister players play Dark Templar and lose because yes since it's guaranteed that the opponent will stop him. It's <strong>much better to make sure Towers takes the field</strong> than to see you lose without even reaching your win condition, which is all the deck does. I have excellent results when choosing to play safe and make Towers with 3k ATK than waiting for the <strong>Dark Templar to take hand and pass with nothing expecting to lose</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo 4: Wind + <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> (Towers 4k ATK)  replay?id=621416-35882425 Gamestate: TOWERS (4k) + Dark + A. I. Reborn + Field /in Hand: Fire /in GY: Wind Pegasus + 2 <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  Opponent's Turn: Reborn Wind and eff Foolish <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Negate) (When you leave Dark on the field with Reborn set you guarantee to return Reborn to the hand and it's very easy to do Xyz RANK-4 <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> on turn 3)  Interesting to analyze if it's worth starting with <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> in this situation where the monster you are going to bring in the <strong>Dark Templar arrow is Dark</strong> because in that case you <strong>would need to use two Dark Infant on turn 1</strong> to do the Arrival but in the case of doing the <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> with <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> avoids wasting LINK-1 because you use Light to make TOWERS. But remember that doing the <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> ROUTE means you can only do <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> when using Dark Templar's Soul Charge so it's a much more <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru </a>sensitive move than the first one. replay?id=621416-35882571 Gamestate: TOWERS (4k) + A. I. Reborn + Field /in GY: Wind Pegasus + 1 Dark Infant (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  Opponent's Turn: Reborn Wind and eff Foolish <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Negate) Or Opponent's Turn: <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> summon Dark and eff Add Fire (Follow Up)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Combo: Fire + Wind You don't need to do <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> so go straight to Splash Mage and after summoning Dark and add Fire you use <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> Reborn Light and go straight to <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and from then on it's like this: <strong>Wind eff send Fire</strong> and trigger Dark Templar summon Light and Fire and make Wind Pegasus and Reborn Light and make <a data-name=""Arrival Cyberse"">Arrival Cyberse</a> with 4k atk. Playing this way you get the follow-up from both <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> and Fire and all thanks to having opened with <a data-name=""Bururu"">Bururu</a> but you pass without negate if you choose not to use Fire's summon with <a data-name=""A. I. Land"">A. I. Land</a>.  replay?id=621416-35885734 Gamestate: TOWERS (4k) + Field /in Hand: Fire + A. I. Meet You /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card) Following Turn: Towers eff make Token and <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> and NS Fire and add Earth and LINK-1 Add Field and summon Earth = <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> = <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> while Dark add <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> back at hand and Reborn Dark Templar with Transcode Talker and does <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a>.  How do you play with the following gamestate: Light in GY and NS Fire? replay?id=621416-35885586 Gamestate: TOWERS (4k) + Reborn + Field /in GY: Wind Pegasus + <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if have used A. I. Meet You and not summoned the revealed card)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Interesting play you can do is in the simplified gamestate that you know it will take interaction and it won't do the TOWERS you can just use Fire add Earth: Fire + Earth = <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> Turbo pop 3 cards plus the battle phase with 5300 atk. Simple Link summon ladder for Accesscode Turbo: Splage Mage = Transcode Talker = Accesscode Talker can destroy 3 or more cards first.  <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> Reborn 2 monsters = Accesscode Co-Linked with Transcode Talker: replay?id=621416-35880366  In the gamestate of <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> + <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> + Dark/Light going according to the deck's default move is also <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> hitting twice with <a data-name=""Update Jummer"">Update Jummer</a> and Splash Mage as material: Another simple way to OTK is to <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> + <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> and reborn <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> in Battle Phase for game. replay?id=621416-35881725  Simple OTK under <a data-name=""Droll&amp;Lock Bird"">Droll&amp;Lock Bird</a> = Light + <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> NS Light and eff add FIELD and take Droll&amp;Lock Bird LINK-1 Dark Infant and Field summon Dark and Dark eff Add Light LINK-2 <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> and Field summon Light and Splash summon Doyo = Update Jammer = Accesscode cl1 Update Jammer cl2 Accesscode = 8600damage in battle phase  You can <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> with Material Arrival. gaining 6k atk = 83atk. Field summon anything and Arrival eff destroy opponent's monster to make Token = Splash Mage = Reborn <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> and make Accesscode using everything and become Unaffected.  <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> + Light or 2 Cyberse any to get to Splash Mage = Accesscode 53atk and Nibiru 30atk for game.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Disregard the Side Deck because it doesn't exist in Master Duel but the first 6 cards are possible options to use in the deck to make a Turn 1 combo different from Towers Turbo and I demonstrate the following combos. So different from what everyone thinks about @Ignister you do <strong>have other boss monster turn 1 options other than Towers</strong>, being <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> which is basically an omni negate of monster effects and <a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a> which is a <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> on the field with mandatory effect that is not hard once per turn.  Combo 1: Fire/Light/A. I. Meet You/Cynet Mine 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> 2 negates + Hand Trap Level 4)  replay?id=621416-35837731 Gamestate: Darkfluid (<strong>2 monster negates and Unaffected until End Opponent's Turn</strong>) + Field /in Hand: A. I. Meet You + Retaliating ""C"" /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if not summoned the revealed card)  Combo 2: 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> Turbo)  replay?id=621416-35838030 Gamestate: <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> (2 monster negates) + <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> + Field /in Hand: A. I. Reborn /in GY: Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if not summoned the revealed card)  As you will see in the replays you can choose to have the <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> as an End Board Boss Monster which is a LINK-5 capable of <strong>negating the activation of the opponent's monsters effects</strong> and with the detail of not being once per turn. But his problem is that first you will only be able to do it with 2 negates because you will always have at most <strong>1 Synchro and 1 Xyz in the GY gaining 2 counters</strong>. Second it doesn't destroy the monster so it becomes a weak disruption to the investment needed to put it on the field. Third you will need to use <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> in the Extra Deck which is an <strong>excellent strong Xyz</strong> but this deck doesn't have much space in the Extra Deck for you to replace it with. The GOOD level 4 Hand Traps targets in the game are only 3: <a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a>, <a data-name=""Retaliating &quot;C&quot;"">Retaliating ""C""</a> and <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> so using <a data-name=""Darkfluid"">Darkfluid</a> seems to me an engine that depends a lot on the metacall inserted as for example some of these hand traps must be very good in format to consider using Darkfluid combo.  Combo 3: 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a> Double Raigeki)  replay?id=621416-35838685 Gamestate: <a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> + Field + <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> /in Hand: Nothing /in GY: <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> + Wind Pegasus (Don't Forget End Phase -2300damage if not summoned the revealed card) (Remember that Bomber Dragon doesn't let you attack with other monsters on the turn it uses its Raigeki effect)  <a data-name=""Bomber Dragon"">Bomber Dragon</a> Combo is very good and your deck can practically do the same interaction as <strong>Double Raigeki's Prank-kids Battlebutler</strong> but you have much less resilience to interactions than Prank-kids losing to a lot of hand trap so I prefer not to use it in Master Duel but in a better game of 3 I would be using a copy of Bomber Dragon in the Side Deck just to switch in game 2 or 3 of the match <strong>if I am facing a Combo deck because Double Raigeki is excellent against this type of strategy</strong>.  Combo 4: 1 Card Combo (<a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a>) replay?id=621416-35838890 Gamestate: <a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a> + Field + (any BROKEN SPELL/TRAP in the GAME) /in Hand: <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> + 1 DRAW /in GY: Wind Pegasus  <a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a> is the replacement for LINK-3 Fire @Ignister which is used in the deck only because you need a 2300atk LINK Monster of Fire attribute to reveal with <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a>. Heatsoul is <strong>infinitely better option</strong> because it is a good card to give Summon since it basically has a Quick effect <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> every turn at a cost of 1000LP, so you draw 1 card on your turn, 1 card on your opponent's turn, and so on while they are on the field. I don't think this is the best <a data-name=""Heatsoul"">Heatsoul</a> combo possible to do with the deck but as it doesn't exist in the TCG I didn't delve into how the deck abuses this card but for sure when it arrives in the TCG this deck will be better than it currently is .  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ***Board-breaking play: Field Special Fire and Fire eff Add Light NS Light and eff target Fire and become Level 4 RANK-4 <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> (in the Extra Monster Zone) and use eff to force Interactions and keep going after that.  ***Another cool situation to break field in Grind Game: <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> = Summon <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and in Battle Phase use eff to Reborn Towers In M2 you use Towers eff pop 1 Monster to make <strong>Token</strong> and do <strong>Accesscode Co-Linked with Transcode Talker</strong> to clear the rest of the field or force one more interation. And you can even do <a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a> using the Token to bounce a monster you don't want to send to the GY like the Tri-Brigade <a data-name=""Shuraig"">Shuraig</a>. replay?id=621416-35884691  ***In super common gamestate: <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> + <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> + Light/Dark = <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> and eff Reborn Splash Mage Use Splash Mage and Wind Pegasus to make <a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a> and eff Bounce 1 monster and <a data-name=""Make Accesscode"">Make Accesscode</a> to clear the rest of the field.  Turn 3 against Backrow decks: In Main Phase 1 you use Towers eff destroy and summon Token and LINK-1 <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> with the Token and use Light or Dark eff to Add <a data-name=""A. I. Reborn"">A. I. Reborn</a> from Deck or GY to hand and use Reborn to summon <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> from gy to use eff to Destroy Backrow. A point to think about is in the pos-side deck if it's worth doing <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> Turn 1 against trap match or leaving it in the Extra Deck and doing it turn 3 to force backrow. For example: Field + Light (Follow Up Turn 3) = replay?id=621416-35884979  //////////////////////////////////////////////// In the Grind Game that you were stopped by hand traps you can summon <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> and make <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> and <strong>chain block the Dark Infant</strong> with Doyon cl2 granting access to the Field. This is so good that if you open it with Fire + Light + <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> you already start with A. I. Meet You add <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> so that in case the combo doesn't pass you guarantee access to Field on turn 3. Having the <strong>field in circulation as soon as possible is very necessary</strong> so if you open with Light and <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a>/Fire start adding the Field and not Reborn Spell <strong>because if the Dark Infant doesn't solve you lose</strong>. Having <strong>two fields is also good for A. I. Contact</strong> to solve in the Grind Game.  Even if you open with all possible engine cards you use <a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> because it's free to add any name to the hand and it also goes back to the hand with the <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> effect to be the second Follow Up on the turn.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Below is the decklist I currently use in Master Duel, disregard the Side Deck because it doesn't exist in Master Duel. All the tech cards I use are of <strong>Normal (N) and Rare (R) rarity</strong> because it is difficult to craft the <strong>Super Rare (SR) and Ultra Rare (UR)</strong> rarity cards at least at the beginning of the game or without spending money what I refuse to do it because I'm not going to give money to this company called Komoney. If I had enough SR and UR all my staples that I'm presenting in the deck profile <strong>would be hand traps because that's how @Ignister plays: fill the opponent with hand trap until he stops and the game comes back to you</strong>, in yugioh you don't you can say yes to card effects if not you lose easily and for sure using 15 to 18 tech cards is ideal in @Ignister."

Chaos-Monarchs are basically playing the Monarchs you know and love, but with the serenity of a Chaos package that doesn't just work in Thunder Dragons. With the ease of the Light and Dark Squires, Erebus, Zaborg, and Ehther can deploy all kinds of tomfuckery in the OTK department: from popping itself to take a cheeky peeky into your opponents Extra deck; to ruining your opponents Protos *(they didn't use their Maxx-C on)* by shuffling it back to the deck (at a 1 of 5+ chance); to even special summoning another Monarch to use for OTK or later for the usually tranquility and Torment. Before I forget, the chaos package I will be using is the usual copy of Collapserpent and Wyverburster, alongside The Chaos Creator, Chaos Space, and Chaos Daedalus *(A monster that protects light and dark monsters from effects; and banishes up to two cards for every field spell on either players side of the field).* Anchamoufrite is also a widely used staple in Monarchs that could be recycled with Chaos Space to be used again later on. As for the side Deck, I insisted on just a default side deck because of a lack of data for what a side deck for any competitive Monarch builds could look like in this day of age.</p>"

Your standard turn 1 play is to either negate all the Extra Deck with Zoroa or sit on a Vahram and Rilliona in DEF. Anything else is just extra.  If you can't go into the Extra Deck, use the charmers to augment ATK without slowing you down since being level 4 Spellcasters is what Magistus thrive off.  I only run 3 charmers in the main deck because I have access to all of their ED variants thanks to Crowley. The only one missing is Dharc, which will be replacing Aussa in the Extra Deck and Aussa will be take up a Sphere Mode slot. You only want 2 charmers in the ED because on average your opponent will run either Light or Dark Boss monsters. Once they are in the GY, you are free to take them for your own.  In all fairness, I only play Accesscode Talker because there's no way for this deck to get over Monsters with 4000 ATK and protections without struggling"

It's very hard for opponent to deal with 1 or 2 Borrelswords that dont get destroyed by effects or battle. Hence, Immortal FurHire!  We dont counter Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler there's ways to do that but it's not worth putting in deck to counter Ash Blossom or Veiler. Less consistent if we add cards to counter it.  Added 3 copies of I:P Masquerena so you can protect all 3 copies of your Borrelsword Dragon (You need that for clever opponents) from Effects so it won't be destroyed by both Card Effects and Battle. Masquerena also allows you to point a link so you can use World Legacy Succession to SS Borrelsword from GY in case it does get wiped somehow. Added protection.  Added 3 copies of Maxx 'C' because every deck in rank is SS turn 1 or 2. This draws you lots of cards if its in your opening hand.  Updated - Now has a ton more GY recursion + More Summons up to 26 for consistency. There's too much control decks floating around with tons of Board Wipes you need to be able to recover your Borrelsword from GY if this happens or you loose 4 summons.  100% Consistent.

This summon requires both 1 Mirror Force (trap card) and 1 The Fang of Critias (spell card). To search for these cards, you may use Gold Sarcophagus and Different Dimension Capsule.  While waiting for your main fusion, you can still play for some high ATK with the red-eyes portion of the deck. Three Red-Eyes Fusion spell cards can be used to fusion summon Red-Eyes Slash Dragon, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon and Meteor Black Comet Dragon. (OPTIONAL: You can replace one of these fusions, alongside with their respective fusion material from the main deck, with Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and a Dark Magician. Me and my friends banned this monster from our table, so I've built the deck without it).  If you drew really bad, you can still link summon Predaplant Anaconda, pay 2000 LP and activate red-eyes fusion from your deck.  There are a few other Red-Eyes cards that can help you stack your field with high level monsters, setting you up for some XYZ summons. Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon allows you to summon your black dragons from the GY, while burning your opponent's LPs. Dark Armed can be summoned with just one dark dragon monster and destroy opponent cards. Number 11 takes control of your opponent's monster and Number 76 is immune to monsters with the same attribute as her. She can recycle her materials to give her additional attributes.  The rest of the deck is filled with support cards, and you can replace them at your convenience."

First of all, if you're really dedicated on building an Invoked strategy to its maximum potential, you need as much coverage as you can possibly get, that's why you see older Invoked lists running as many powerful hand traps that are either floodgates (like <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> or <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>) or those that can also act as bodies on board (like <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>, <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, or <a data-name=""The Iris Swordsoul"">The Iris Swordsoul</a>, the latter still unavailable in Master Duel as of now), or those that provide different attributes as well for your Fusion summons, and also if you've seen my past guides, this is one of the answers as to why I have been splashing Invoked in every archetype that does not really need a Normal Summon, but can be mutually beneficial as well. Take a look at my Invoked Lyrilusc and Invoked Salamangreat list, if you still haven't. I have tested this deck so many goddamn times, it's not even funny, I've seen and heard lot of people recommend newer players to Master Duel to buy certain blow out staples like Lightning Storm, for example, and I am here to tell you that Lightning Storm is way weaker than Evenly Matched for and against Invoked Shaddolls for the one simple reason of having Trap coverage. I couldn't count how many people I've seen running only one <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a> and one <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> in their Invoked Shaddoll list with their reasoning only being ""if you need to run 3 copies of <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> or more than two Resh then you suck at managing your resources bro"", only to lose post siding to a blinding second strategy with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, it's painful. If you don't have <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> yet, but have already gotten your <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s, that will do for now but I really do suggest playing <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> over it in this format because Eldlich is one of the stronger top tier decks in Master Duel as of today, and with <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> you instantly lose against <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> and even if you do manage to clear their entire back row with <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, their graveyard is already set up for next play, thanks to you destroying them and on that case, the best case scenario left for you would be finding a way to dump <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> to the graveyard to hopefully clear all them Golden Land and Eldlixir traps, which arguably takes more significant effort AND resources than just banishing them face down with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and being patient with your plays. Having either <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> in your deck than Lightning Storm just increases your success and coverage significantly in mirror matches.</span>  <strong>""<a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a>?""</strong>  <span>Yes, THE <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a>. There will be occasions where you will find yourself not being able to continue your resource loop with your <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a> enough, most likely due to interruptions, and this is where <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a> comes to the rescue. Also we're not playing <a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a> in this list either because we're playing <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> instead but either's fine. Most would say that it's an optional pick in this build but I disagree, both in Invoked and Pure Shaddoll builds. You could always make use of an extra ""Shaddoll"" name, might as well use someone that helps you do the thing you're best at, and that is grinding the hell out of your opponent's resources.</span>  <strong>""Invoked Raidjin?""</strong>  <span>Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades are famous for their first turn <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a> set up after gaining access to <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Revolt"">Tri-Brigade Revolt</a>, and that's where <a data-name=""Invoked Raidjin"">Invoked Raidjin</a> comes in crucially. As soon as two <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Recital Starling"">Lyrilusc - Recital Starling</a>s hits the board, just book the one without <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow"">Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow</a> as material with his effect. Since this is a best of one game, you really don't have any way to figure out whether your opponent is playing Lyrilusc Tri-Brigade let's be honest, but then if the time comes where you need that sort of interaction, it does not necessarily mean that it had to be exactly that scenario in particular, it could also be done at the middle of your opponent stacking Zoodiac monsters for <a data-name=""Zoodiac Drident"">Zoodiac Drident</a> or when your opponent summons <a data-name=""Downerd Magician"">Downerd Magician</a> or <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a> for <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a>, it's there. You don't always need destruction effects to interrupt your opponent.</span>  I could talk all day about how many possible interactions and play lines you could choose to do with this deck against the current meta match ups, but I honestly do not have enough time for that, it would be great and I'd love to do it, but I do not have the means yet but I digress. If there's one thing you might consider changing in this deck is substituting one of your other <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Constructs"">El Shaddoll Constructs</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> for a copy of <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> for attribute coverage for the purposes of your <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> since Eldlich runs <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a> which is an EARTH monster, and match up coverage for them weird attributes that some rogue decks like EARTH Machines have. So yeah, that's pretty much it. I look forward into climbing more with this list and if you're a fellow Invoked player, first of all based by the way, and I wish you good luck on the ladder.  &nbsp;"

Of the 12 UR's, 5 are free/guaranteed, 2-3 are optional,  and only 4-5 are really important and need to be made/found. I don't think I'm super amazing at this game, or that this deck is unbeatable or anything, but its easy to pilot and can get you results up to about plat 4 while being very fun. The main goal of this deck is to go from the Psychic type pilot to the Machine type ships, and then back once the ships are destroyed. This can lead to many interresting plays like ladder combos where you combo a Pilot into another Pilot (repeat as available) into a machine finisher or self destroying ships to bring out one more suited for the current situation.  I will start off defining the roles of each card in this deck. I know this is very long, and I do think its worth it to read all of it, but I will be putting tl:dr's for everything right below them so you don't have to do excessive reading if you don't want to.  MAJOR UPDATE 1: I found this deck to be missing draw ability, so I bit the bullet and crafted 3 Pot Of Extravagance's and mill proofed my extra deck by swapping out the filler for more copies of the important stuff. I also dropped 1 Strawman and Bottomless Trap Hole to make room for these PoE's, meaning I'm now at 41 cards. You can choose to keep those in if you like them, since as a pure +1 PoE doesn't really take up deck space in the traditional sense.  MAJOR UPDATE 2: After much deliberation, I have decided to swap out both copies of Fiendish Chain for Lost Wind. This isn't a straight upgrade, as Fiendish Chain's ability to stop attacking is incredibly valuable, but I have decided that the pros of Lost Wind, being its reusability, it not being a continuous trap that will usually become a deadweight row, and ability to make getting over bigger monsters easier, outweigh that one singular advantage for Fiendish Chain. Lost Wind wasn't the only alternative option I considered, as I also looked into Solemn Strike. but due to this deck's budget nature I believe that Lost Wind does an ok enough imitation of Strike to justify passing on the much more expensive Strike (if you have the dust go for Strike though, 1500 life points is basically nothing.)  MAJOR UPDATE 3: Ash is just too good in this format to be only at 1, so I swapped out the last Strawman and one of the Forerunners for two extra copies. Should be pretty obvious why extra copies of Ash are helpful. They were leftovers from another deck I made, but this deck still was able to get to plat without them so if you're really crunched for gems you can survive without them. The other change I made was swapping out one Dogmatika Punishment for the free Lightning Storm. DP is v good and I still love its flexability, but Lightning Storm is one of the best going 2nd cards in the game (which we want to go) and being able to pop front or back row depending on your needs is great, and is a great otk enabler which this deck can do pretty well.  MAJOR UPDATE 4: Rebudgetized the deck, since it was starting to get up there in terms of cost and that was contrary to the stated goal of this deck. The extra deck mostly remade in order to reflect its rarity of use, 2 Ash's were swapped out for Gamma's (which work better in this deck most of the time anyways), and Harpies was swapped back out, leaving Lightning Storm as the primary backrow removal since its given away for free. Adjusted a few other ratios as well.  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a> x1</strong>: Driver is a level 6 normal monster with 2500/0. It is only here because Gamma needs it to work. Despite that, if you can get it on your turn its hardly useless, as a 2500 beatstick on player phase is nice, and you can also take it and Gamma and go into links. If at all possible you want Driver to end up in the graveyard before the end of the turn its summoned, as your 2nd Gamma can use him from there but not the banish zone, so ramming it, sacrificing it, or using it as material should always be the priority if you proc it on player phase. Overall a garnet, but as far as garnets go its not the worst. Some people run 2 of this to make sure both their Gamma's will go off, but games don't last that long so I think thats foolish. Run at 1.  Driver tl,dr: Your Gamma's powercell, try and get it in the grave.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Tincan"">Kozmo Tincan</a> x3</strong>: Tincan is a level 1 monster with 0/0 that in the endphase, can pay 500 lifepoints to search 3 Kozmo cards from your deck w different names and your opponent blindly picks one for you to add to your hand, and like all pilots you can banish them at basically any point into a higher leveled Kozmo from your hand (Im not gonna mention this effect from now on unless theres smth dif about it for the monster). Tincan is one of your two best no trib options along with Farm Girl, and is going to generally be your best turn 1 option due to being able search without needing to attack unlike Farm Girl. This getting Ashed if you dont already have a ship or Wickedwitch in your hand can be disasterous in predictable ways, but even with the risk of that I'd rather go with this over Strawman, Farmgirl, and Goodwitch even if I'm feeling very cautious because the reward is so high. Theres only a ~33% chance of your opponent having Ash in their opening hand  if they're running it at 3 in a 40 card deck, so while it can be anxiety inducing statistically you're probably gonna be fine. Being able to get an untargetable 2800 atk+ beatstick guaranteed with this things effect is really really strong, and if you already have your beatstick ready then going for Kozmotown for banishment returnal, Dark Lady for ladder combos, or Sliprider for backrow removal are nice alternative paths to shoot for. His 0 attack doesn't lend itself to ladder combos nearly as well as Farm Girl's 1500+search does, but being the lowest level pilot means that he will always have something to combo into if you have another Kozmo in your hand which is nice. Can be searched by E Tele, but he should never be the target unless all 5 of your Strawmans and Farmgirls are unavailable somehow. Overall a very strong card that can open up many different routes for you to take.  Tincan tl,dr: Best option for turn 1, usually wanna search Forerunner/Destroyer/Eclipse  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Strawman"">Kozmo Strawman</a> x2 DROPPED TO 1 DROPPED TO 0</strong>: Strawman is a level 2 500/1800 that you can pay 500 lp to return one of your banished Kozmos for a turn with their effect negated before they get thrown back. Honestly in my opinion Strawman is probably the weakest of the no trib Kozmos that I actually use, and with more gems I might swap them out for more copies of Ash or smth, but I wanted more opening board consistency for having something out so its here now and so I'm still gonna go over it. Strawman's return effect isn't super great or useful since Kozmotown does basically the same thing but without effect negation, and the effects are what make these monsters good most of the time. Obviously you're not always gonna have Kozmotown, but this deck already can run generally pretty fine even without Kozmotown so a worse version of that isn't exactly making a great case for it being here. With that being said, a free monster is a free monster, and when you have something that loves clear boards as much as Farm Girl does even a dumb beatstick will be pretty useful at times. Speaking of Farm Girl, being able to ladder into her is another one of his big selling points, and he's the only one with an actual attack stat to be able to do so. 500 chip may not sound like a lot, and it really isnt, but a Straw-Farm-Destroyer combo does 5k which is pretty beefy, and that extra 500 is the difference between being able to kill off of your next from full  Straw-4 star-Dark Lady-Destroyer ladder vs them living on 4 or 500 lp. This situation doesn't happen a whole lot, especially not with a clear board that Strawman would need to start this combo, but its not the most impossible thing to set up, especially with all the monster removal packed in this deck. It can also be searched by E Tele, but most of the time it's better to go for Farmgirl. Overall not great, feel free to replace imo but its hard to make a truly awful pilot.  Strawman tl,dr: Not a great card and can be replaced, but while it's here recycling from banish for 500 is pretty nice  <strong><a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> x2:</strong> Gamma is a level 2 tuner 1000/0 that can't be normal summoned or set, and has the effect that when your opponent activates a monster effect while you control no monsters, you can negate and destroy that and special summon Gamma and Driver to the field, and then at the end of the turn banish them. This should be Kozmo's hand trap of choice. As an enemy phase card this is straight up better than Ash, as trading the ability to hit spell/traps for the ability to negate any effect and destroy the monster while also fortifying your own board is a trade I am extremely comfortable with making. Because this deck combos vertically instead of horizontally, this card is usually better than Ash on player phase too, as our cards get themselves off the field before their effects, which means if your ship gets popped and you're banishing for a search if it gets Ashed you can continue the search with 3500 damage extra now on the board, usually enough to go for game. This card is semi Ash proof as its effect can be negated by Ash but you don't lose any resources and its not a once per turn, so you can just use it again on the next monster effect your opponent procs. Whether its better to use Gamma on enemy phase or player phase is very matchup dependent, as if theyre ending on something like Apollo then thats free advantage for you on your turn, but if theyre something like tri then popping their normal when it goes to use its link effect can be a huge momentum shift. Since this is a going 2nd deck we have the advantage of knowing the situation better than our opponent, so make sure you're really putting thought as to when best to use this given your hand, your opponents deck, and the current situation.  Overall this is an incredible card that feels like it was made for this deck (it can even be searched by E Tele!), def run it at as many copies as are legal.  Gamma tl,dr: Stop plays, get advantage, win games  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Farmgirl"">Kozmo Farmgirl</a> x3</strong>: Farmgirl is a level 3 1500/1000 that if it inflicts battle damage, you can pay 500 life points to add any Kozmo card to your hand. This is the beating heart of the deck. Making clear front rows for her to get a potshot in and start the comboing is the goal of many of the trap cards in the deck. Her being level 3 is an absolute blessing, because that means that its eligible for E Tele, and she will usually be the best target for it in this deck. 1500 atk isn't nothing, but you're usually going to have to rely on traps or a ship to blast open a hole for her to proc her effect, which as I said before isn't super hard to do. Being able to search for ANY Kozmo card from your deck means that it can be easily tailored to fit your current situation, but the most common cards you'll go for are Dark Destroyer for its beefy attack, sometimes its monster removal and recycling effect (that Eclipser doesn't have), Sliprider for when you need a backrow card sniped, Dark Lady for when you already have a beefy ship in the hand and want to ladder, and Kozmotown for when you really just want Kozmotown idk. Now, most combos with this card are very self apparent, since there's really only so much you can do with a single fetch in this deck, but there is one slightly less obvious combo that I wanted to highlight due to its power. The prerequisites for this combo are that you have both Farmgirl and either Tincan/Strawman on the field, no ship in the hand, and a way to get damage with Farmgirl (obviously). This situation can be quite easily set up by either fetching one of these (usually Tincan) with a dying ship's effect on enemy phase and then summoning the other, or just E Tele one and summon the other. After getting the damage with Farmgirl, fetch another Farmgirl and swap her in on top of Straw/Tin, and then potshot with the new Farmgirl and fetch a new ship to go on top of one of the Farmgirls. The strengths of this combo are numerous. First off, its the most damaging combo you can get off of this situation, where you get a minimum of 5100 damage (FG 1 getting over whatever it kills by 100 into making a clear board into Strawman 500 into 2nd FG 1500 into Destroyer 3000) vs 3600 without the extra step. The other very strong result is that you end turn with a Farmgirl on your field. More monsters is always good, and having potential access to her ability again next turn is always good. However there are also 2 things to be weary of with this combo, and those are that you can't activate Farmgirls swapout effect multiple times in one turn, even if there are multiple copies. and also that if you have a ship in the hand just going for a ship search is better. Double ships will be more damaging and leave you with guaranteed swaps on death, which is generally better than what Farmgirl can offer on enemy phase. She's not super amazing for turn 1 since she'll usually be off the board before she has a chance to activate her effect, but she doesn't do it particularly worse than Strawman or Good Witch. If you're really ballsy and the only no trib you draw turn 1 is Farm Girl you could go for the no monster play on t1 to give her the best chance of procing her ability t3 since it absolutely is strong enough to consider, but generally thats not advised for obvious reasons. Overall a very very good card and one of the main ways you will start combos with this deck.  Farmgirl tl,dr: Make an opening for her and she will lead you to victory  <strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> x1 CHANGED TO x3 DROPPED TO x1:</strong> Ash is a level 3 0/1800 tuner that you can discard to stop a card effect that would add to hand from deck, special summon from deck, or send a card from the deck to the graveyard. This card does not have the standard upgrade effect of the other pilots in this deck and can't be fetched by E Tele. I was running this card at 1 because I was too broke to run it at 3, and now with the extra materials I've got from playing the game for an extra month or so I've been able to get another 2. One of the best cards in the game and one of player 2's best defenses against the unchecked tyranny of player 1.  Ash tl,dr: It stops plays from your hand  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Goodwitch"">Kozmo Goodwitch</a> x1: </strong>Goodwitch is a level 4 1800/1000 that you can pay 500 lp to change one face up monster your opponent controls to face down defense. In theory Goodwitch's effect should be pretty good. Being able to interupt a continuous monster effect that may be giving you problems or get over a beatstick with bad defenses obviously give it usecases, but in practice I really havent found a whole lot of use of it. A lot of things that have continuous effects that you'd like to interupt can't be targeted, and the beefy beatsticks usually either also cant be targeted or have good enough defenses that it wouldn't help a lot in the first place to swap them. This would obviously be much stronger as a quick effect, but it isnt, so theres no use complaining. Can't be fetched by E Tele (nothing from here on can), but you almost never would even if you could. The 1800 atk is nice enough so you can get over stuff if your opponent bricked or smth, but its not really doing much otherwise. Its one of the 2 worst no trib Kozmos I use alongside Strawman, which is why its at 1, but this deck has a lot of stuff that clear front rows so 1800 damage into tag out is pretty alright even if its effect isnt super great.  Goodwitch tl,dr: Effect is mid, but 1800 atk from a level 4 is nothing to scoff at ig.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmoll Wickedwitch"">Kozmoll Wickedwitch</a> x3:</strong> Wickedwitch is a level 4 1900/300 that you can pay 1000 lp during either players turn to make it so this card cant be destroyed by battle or card effects for the rest of the turn. I really like this card. Its the deck's 2nd best turn 1 no trib behind Tincan because its effect will almost guarantee it lives to see turn 2 while dampening whatever damage you'd take by 1900 per attack, which isn't an insignificant amount at all. Its effect also lets it live Tor Trib, which I run at 2 and is something the other pilots don't deal with super amazingly. Even beyond turn 1 it provides good damage and can get over  some stuff. Its effect isn't super team focused or synergistic beyond the TT thing, but who can say no to a good old fashioned lv 4 beat stick in a deck about beatsticking your opponent to death. I think common consensus on this monster is generally mixed to negative, but I like it a lot and am never really annoyed when it shows up in my hand turn 1. I did run this at 2 for a while and it wasn't a super huge deal, but I do like making sure I get my no trib out turn 1 so I switched in a 3rd copy. If you have something you really want to add in here wouldn't be a bad place to make a cut.  Wickedwitch tl,dr: Use its effect to tank stuff and make sure your front row is never empty, strong as a turn 1 play  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Sliprider"">Kozmo Sliprider</a> x2: </strong>Sliprider is a level 5 2300/800 that can destroy 1 spell/trap when it's summoned, and has the first of our ship abilities where when it is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect it can banish itself to summon a lower leveled Kozmo from the deck. Sliprider is pretty good and has a clear usecase: there is an annoying backrow card and you want to get rid of it or you want to preemptively get rid of one. This deck is generally light on backrow removal, with Dogmatika Punishment into N'tss and Harpies Feather Duster being the only other 2 options, so this serves a valuable niche. Its also supremely summonable, being able to be fetched by all the ships (outside Eclipse) and summoned by all the pilots (outside Dark Lady), and if you're in a situation where your effects are being limited it only requires 1 tribute as disgusting as that is to even consider in this deck. The tradeoff for its summonability is that its comboability is gerneally weaker than most other stuff in the deck, but even w that said compared to a lot of stuff outside of the deck fetching a free level 4 or lower on death is very comboable. On its destruction effect for both player phase and enemy phase Wickedwitch is generally going to be your best bet due to its beefiness and survivability, but as always context is king so don't treat that as a hard rule and the other no tribs also all have situations where they should be fetched instead. 2300 atk is nice if you need to attack with this, but generally this card isn't gonna be used for laddering since its the weakest of the 3 ships in this deck by a good margin. This is a good card with common usecases, but due to the decks explosive nature you don't really need to run more than 2 imo. You could easily swap out Dark Eclipser or one of your Forerunners for another one of these if you want more utility over beatsticking, or even drop this to 1 in exchange for a Spell/Trap of your choice if its summonability makes it consistent enough for your preference.  Sliprider tl,dr: Backrow removal that goes into other stuff on death  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmoll Dark Lady"">Kozmoll Dark Lady</a> x1 CHANGED TO x2:</strong> Dark Lady is a level 5 2200/1800 that as a quick effect once per turn you can pay 1000 lifepoints to negate the activation of a monster's effect and destroy that monster. Despite being level 5, Dark Lady has the pilot's banish effect rather than the ships. This card is generally pretty niche in its uses, but its very strong in its niches. By default it being level 5 makes it less flexible, but it has the same high amount of summonability as Sliprider so it gets around that quite nicely. Its effect is pretty darn good, obviously being able to neg anything active without a protection effect is very strong, but the problem with this is that most of the effects that give this deck problems are either effect negaters, which are usually either passive or on cards bigger than this. This card has to be used as a an predictive play rather than a reactionary play, because if something that negates effects is going to happen it will be able to negate the pilot's effects that would bring this out, but a 2200 with no protection vs backrow effects doesn't have the greatest shelf life. Despite this bellyaching the effect is still very good, and I have considered even swapping out a Forerunner for another copy of this. This effects is good, but the main draw for this card to me is as the biggest pilot in a ladder combo. Level 5 is a bit of an awkward level to be searching up or down in this deck, but I do think searching up is better for it as it can combo into your untargetable bosses and off itself as the situation demands. As I said before a full ladder of farm-lv 4-lady-destroyer will kill from full, and while this is on the less practical side the shorter farm-lady-bigship combo is incredibly practical and easy to pull off, and deals a fat 6500 minimum. I only ran this at 1 because its easier for this to become a bit of a brick than most other monsters in this deck, but being the difference between a ladder killing from full vs not is  worth making a spot for still and following that logic its generally something I'd like in my hand, so I bumped it up to 2. If I were making cuts I would look elsewhere first.  Dark Lady tl,dr: Good for ladder combos and interrupting combos  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Forerunner"">Kozmo Forerunner</a> x3 DROPPED TO x2:</strong> Forerunner is a level 7 2800/1400 that is untargetable by opponents card effects and heals you 1000 lp during your standby phase. This card has the ship banish effect. This is the first of the boss monsters, and as such its usecase of ""I want a fat unmovable beatstick"" is pretty apparent. Can (and usually will) be comboed into by Dark Destroyer's death effect which makes getting it out plenty easy. 2800 atk is plenty decent and will get it over most non superbosses. The 1000 lp healing is really not super useful unless you're in a crazy stalemate, the lp costs in this deck are very low and almost never come into play. On death I usually go into Dark Lady or Wickedwitch depending on whether it died on player phase or enemy phase. Honestly not a super complicated card, what you see is what you get. I often see this being run at 1 or 2, but I run it at 3 because I value getting out a boss early to punch holes for Farmgirl so for this build in particular I wouldn't suggest going below 2.  Forerunner tl,dr: Untargetable beatstick that can go into other stuff on death  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Dark Destroyer"">Kozmo Dark Destroyer</a> x3:</strong> Dark Destroyer is a level 8 3000/1800 that is untargetable by opponents card effects and can optionally target and destroy 1 monster on entry. This has the ship banish effect. This is the Big Boss of the deck, and is usually what you are going to try and go into. Beyond just being an untargetable 3000 beatstick, its on entry effect makes it one of the most versitile cards in the deck. You can pull interesting plays such as bringing it in during the battle phase and proccing its effect on a teammate ship that already attacked to get more damage out of the new monster summoned by the ships banish effect, you can proc its effect on itself and search out Sliprider if you really need a backrow card gone right now, or you could even destroy an opponents monster with it! Dark Destroyer also has the best banish effect of any monster in this deck, giving you the monster of your choice for free. I usually go with Forerunner since that has very similar board presence, but hopefully these writeups will have given you the situations where all the other cards would be useful so you don't just autopilot into Forerunner no matter the situation.  This ability doesn't just work on other monsters, but it can also proc on itself. ""But Schwa, why would you want to get rid of your own best monster?"" you may ask. And the answer to that is ""For sick plays."" There are two major scenarios where this can be great, beyond the obvious ""I need a backrow popped so lemme go into sliprider rq"".  The first doesn't really pop up in this deck since Strawman was dropped, but if you summon Dark Destroyer, pop itself, and go into Strawman which then revives Dark Destroyer. It's not a super crazy combo, but its free attack and free advantage, so if you're running Strawman keep that one in mind. The other one is much, much stronger. Say you're going second and open Raigeki, Kozmotown, Goodwitch, Forerunner, and Dark Destroyer. A pretty decent hand right? Your first reaction might be to play Town and gamble on recycling Forerunner into Farmgirl, but thats actually completely unnecessary, as if your Raigeki goes off you have a clear path to game. What you would do in this situation is start with Goodwitch and attack as usual, then go into Dark Destroyer as usual, but pop itself and then go into Farmgirl. From there you do the typical ladder combo. As long as you have a level 4, Dark Destroyer, and either a big ship or Dark Lady in your opening hand you can do the full combo. 3000 atk is usually enough to get the job done over most stuff, but if it isnt then thats why we have our xyz's. Endgame often results in multiple of these on the board, which is why the only xyz's I specifically looked for and that arent just ed filler are rank 8's. Zombiestein get you over basically everything with its 4500 atk and Teardrop's effect circumvents ""Cant be destroyed"" effects, but these cards also lose Destroyer's protection effect and you also lose Destroyer's banish effect so don't just go into those willy nilly. Overall this is your Big Boss monster, its incredibly easy to put out on the field, and its incredible effects make it incredibly versatile. If you're not running this at 3 its either because this got semi-limited again or because you're throwing.  Destroyer tl,dr: Your endgoal. Increidbly versatile untargetable beatstick that goes into basically anything else on death. Should prolly read this one imo.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmo Dark Eclipse"">Kozmo Dark Eclipse</a> x1:</strong> Dark Eclipse is a level 9 3000/2600 that is untargetable by opponents card effects, and during either players turn you can banish 1 Kozmo monster from your graveyard to negate and destroy a trap card activation. This has a unique banish effect, where when its destroyed you can add a lower leveled Kozmo to your hand instead of special summoning it like the other ships. Ok so first off, its active effect sounds good! It isn't. You will very rarely have a Kozmo sitting in your graveyard since their effects are all activated by banishing themselves, and passing up opportunities to keep the tempo up just to have fodder for this generally isn't worth it. Its harder to get on the field than basically anything else in the deck, only having the no tribs as its entryway. Its banish effect is also pretty bad compared to everything else, since I don't have to tell you why just adding to hand is worse than special summoning here. Obviously being able to turn this into a free Dark Destroyer might be a bit much, but as is its not very good. Maybe they could have made it search upwards instead of downwards so you could have got a free Dark Planet off of it and that could have made Dark Planet not so awful, but I'm getting into hypotheticals when I should be sticking to the here and now. Anyways, if its active effect sucks, its banish effect sucks, and its comparatively hard to get on the field, whats even the point of this being in the deck? Well, for one its still a 3000 att untargetable beatstick that can be swapped into by any no trib in the deck, which is pretty darn good, if not already covered by multiple other cards in this deck. The other, more interesting case to be made for it is in its interaction with <a data-name=""Kozmo Tincan"">Kozmo Tincan</a>. As you will recall, Tincans effect lets you pick 3 Kozmo cards with different names from you deck and your opponent randomly chooses one of those for you to add to your hand, with the others getting discarded. Generally you will want to try and use this effect to bring out one of your untargetable boss monsters, but without Eclipse you only have 2 of those, making it a 33% chance you get stuck with Sliprider or Dark Lady or Kozmotown or whatever you chose as your third. Add on top the risk of just getting Ashed and you're not looking at a super incredible success rate. However, WITH Eclipse in the deck you have an 100% success rate in being given a boss monster, which is huge for consistency's sake. Even better for Eclipse, you will recall that these non-picked cards are sent to the graveyard, fixing its problem of very rarely having fodder with which to use for its effect. This effect moves those other boss monsters from the generally inaccessible graveyard to the much more easy to retrieve banish zone, making this a win win win situation. Overall, obviously I do have my issues with Eclipse, but its interaction with Tincan and its board presence make it worth running at 1 just for the added consistency it brings there. If you're fine nerfing Tincan pretty harshly you can swap this out for something else.  Eclipse tl,dr: Good off of tincan and an untargetable beatstick, not much else going for it  <strong>Spells</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> x1: </strong>Raigeki is a normal spell that destroys all monsters your opponent controls. Non targeting monster removal is always good and making a clear front row for Farmgirl to start comboing off of is always good. Overall this is a generic staple for a reason, and it fits in well here.  <strong><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> x1 DROPPED: </strong>Feather Duster is a normal spell that destroys all spell and traps that your opponent controls. Originally I had Monster Reborn here when I first made this deck, since its free and obviously great, but it was too reliant on whatever my opponent decided to dump in the graveyard and this deck didn't really have a ton of backrow removal back then so I decided to bite the bullet and craft a HFD. Destroying or forcing premature activations of spells and traps is always good, and being able to attack with a clear heart and mind is reason enough for this to be in the deck. Overall another generic staple that helped patch up a bit of a weak spot with this deck.  <strong>Lightning Storm x1: </strong>This card lets you destroy all attack position monsters your opponent controls or all trap and spells your opponent controls, but only if you control no face up cards. This is basically Raigeki and Harpies in one. Obvs v v good.  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmotown"">Kozmotown</a> x3:</strong> Kozmotown is a field spell that: once per turn lets you return one banished Kozmo monster to your hand at the cost of 100xlv life points, once per turn lets you shuffle any number of Kozmo monsters from your hand back into your deck and then draw that many cards, and when destroyed from the field by a card effect lets you search any Kozmo card from your deck and add to hand. Ok, for starters this is not a lifeblood card, this deck can play and win a duel without ever once seeing this card. It is, however, a really good card that makes the deck more consistent and mobile. Its first effect is going to be its most used one. Making it so that you don't have to rely on drawing new pilots or ships after you offed them in order to keep momentum going is a godsend. If turn 1 you draw a pilot, a ship, and this (not an uncommon scenario at all!) you could much more confidently transition into the ship on player phase instead of waiting until enemy phase because you can recycle the pilot instantly. Making it so banishments don't stick is so obviously and self explanatorily good that I'm not going to go into it, since the answer to ""Is it worth giving up less than 1000 lp to bring back whatever I want from banishment?"" is yes 99% of the time. The second effect isnt going to be used as much as the first, but its still very useful if you're trying to get to a specific non-searchable like Raigeki or if you already have your pilot out and are trying to find a better ship for your hand. If you have this on the field then a lot of the time anything beyond 2 pilots on the field + hand is going to be overkill since you can retrieve them for free, so anything beyond those is a free swap. Only draw pilots? Pick one and swap the rest. Only draw ships? Pick one and swap the rest. Only draw backrow? Set them and pray you live until you can swap LMAO. Another pretty self explanatory effect. The death effect is maybe the strongest, and is usually not known by other players on the ladder who will carelessly pop it often. You can get a free boss or a pilot of your choosing (refer to section 1 to get a good idea of the scenarios where each of those would be useful), or if you feel like you had a good thing going you can just pick up another Kozmotown. Like I said before, Kozmotown isnt a lifeblood card, so honestly I'm usually pretty happy when this effect is popped since it gets me a tailor picked card for the current situation. Overall, despite me emphasizing a few times that you can definitely win without getting this card in a game this is still a very strong card to have, and should always be run at 3. If you like its effect enough you can even throw in Terraforming and Metaverse, but I don't think thats necessary at all and I'd probably sooner run it at 2 than at 4 or 5.  Kozmotown tl,dr: Most of its effects are pretty straighforward and obvious, read the card  <strong><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> x2:</strong> Emergency Teleport (or E Tele as I've been calling it) is a quickplay spell card that special summons one level 3 or lower Psychic monster from your hand or deck and banishes it during this turn's end phase. This card is nuts, like actually insane. 95% of the time we get a level 3 or lower Psychic on the field it's going to be banished before the end of the turn anyways, so this is just a free either turn pilot to either shore up your defenses on enemy phase or lead to huge combos on player phase. The obvious play out of this card is Farmgirl on player phase into ladder combo, which is made much easier because you still have your normal summon for the turn which can then turn itself into a ship to blast a hole in the enemy front row, and from there just go to town. You can also go into Strawman, since returning smth from banishment for some juicy damage is always nice, but that can leave you a bit bare at the end of the turn. As for Tincan I do not know how that card interacts with this one, as I have not tried that combo. If you want to risk it be my guest, but I still think the other two options are better even if it does work because you wont be able to swap Tincan into a ship if you're going for its effect. The two things to be aware of with this card is that all the pilot effects are once per turn tied to the card name, so if you swap out one Farm Girl for a ship then you won't be able to do so with your other Farm Girl that you may have summoned with this, and also that with multiples of the same monster on the field it can become easy to lose track of which one you summoned with this card. Overall this card is insane and you should run as many copies of it as are legal in the current format.  E Tele tl,dr: Go into Farmgirl and go nuts  <strong><a data-name=""Pot Of Extravagance"">Pot Of Extravagance</a> x3 ADDED: </strong>Pot of Extravagance is a normal spell card that at the begining of your main phase 1, you can randomly banish 3 or 6 cards from your extra deck in order to draw 1 or 2 cards respectively, and you can't use any other draw effects the turn this card is used. This card wasn't in the original deck loadout because I was very SR broke, but I believe that was a mistake and that this should definitely be ran. As I play more against stronger meta decks this deck's comparatively weak card gain ability has been highlighted more and more, and this is the best Pot Of for this specific deck, as we don't really use our extra deck for much. Even though we don't really use our extra deck for summoning, this card does require us to prep our extra deck with a bit more care than we originally did, so if you decide that would be too expensive you can either a) drop DP for a different monster or backrow removing card, which has the unfortunate side effect of removing our 2nd best removal card, b) accept that this card will introduce randomness and more uncertainty to DP and keep running it, which has the unfortunate side effect of making rng more prevalent for this deck, or c) run this at 1, drop only one of Strawman/Bottomless Trap Hole, and be conservative with its effect, which has the unfortunate side effect of not really being worth the deck space imo. This works best when you're not scared that you'll turn DP into something not particularly great and are 0k with procing its 6 banish effect, which can be scary if you're only running 1 N'tss, so imo the best solution will be running the 3 N'tss, 3 Wind Pegasus, 3 DMK, and 2 FGD which will cost you a pretty penny. If you're reluctant to spend beyond the 1 N'tss just going for the 3 Wind Pegasus should usually be consistent enough in being able to remove some backrow off of DP, but Wind Peg is obviously worse than N'tss in most situations so that will have to be a decision you make for yourself. Adding the 2 extra Dragon Master Knight's shouldn't be hard at all, its only an R. Overall this card is basically a free +1, with its only side effect being that sometimes DP will be less consistent. With proper extra deck preperation even that side effect drops away, leaving only a free add.  PoE tl,dr: You're gonna have to pony up for a few more Wind Peg's and DMK's at the very least, but a free +1 is going to be worth that every time.  <strong>Traps</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> x2: </strong>Tor Trib is a normal trap card that destroys all monsters on the field when a monster is summoned. Non targeting monster destruction is always good, and the ships obviously weather this effect much better than most other monsters due to their banish effects. Wickedwitch can also tank this effect with her own, which is a nice little bit of synergy. Overall this is a nice little card that is working towards the goal of opening up holes for Farmgirl to take advantage of, and also just destroying opponents monsters is pretty good sometimes. I think it works well here at 2.  Tor Trib tl,dr: Pop this when you have ships and your opponent is building something or when you have no monsters or really whenever it seems like it'd be good.  <strong><a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a><a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole x1"">x1 DROPPED</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Bottomless Trap Hole x1&quot;&gt;x1&lt;/a&gt;:"">:</a> </strong>Bottomless Trap Hole is a normal trap card that when your opponent summons a monster with 1500 or more atk can destroy and banish them. I'm running this because I can't run more than 3 DP's. 1500 atk is obviously an important milestone in terms of this deck, since below that Farmgirl can get over them and start the real comboing so this thing's activation requirement is pretty convenient for that. Banishing rather than sending to gy is also nice, since more stuff likes to play around in the gy vs the banish zone. Overall its a single targeting monster destroyer that operates around a significant milestone for the deck, but we do have 3 DP's which do basically the same thing with more potential utility and less restrictions, so if you think that those cover your bases enough feel free to drop this for smth else.  Bottomless tl,dr: Replaceable card that can drop a monster when its summoned  <strong><a data-name=""Kozmojo"">Kozmojo</a> x2: </strong>Kozmojo is a normal trap card that banishes one card your opponent controls or from the gy at the cost of destroying one of your Kozmo monsters. This is a really good card. Gives you flexibility on when you pop your ships and can smoke front row, back row, or gy which is very useful. The obvious synergy here is with your ships, since when those are destroyed you get the pick of the litter from your deck to replace it. This does not synergize with Wickedwitch, as the destruction is part of the activation requirement. Overall this is a very good, and gives you mobility in addition to removal. Can run this at 3 instead of 2, but I generally keep it at 2 since it doesn't play super nice with the pilots and those are the ones I would usually need the removal to facilitate.  Kozmojo tl,dr: Use this to give yourself mobility out of ships that have already cleared their activation effect, and as a bonus you get a free removal.  <strong><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> x3 DROPPED TO x2 CHANGED TO x3: </strong>DP is a normal trap card that lets you target and destroy one face up monster your opponent controls for the cost of sending a monster with higher attack from your extra deck to the gy. This can only be activated once a turn and you can't special summon from the extra deck until the end of your next turn after this effect resolves. This is the card we build our extra deck around. Outside of Raigeki this is your best monster removal option imo. It does target and it does require you to send a monster with higher atk to the graveyard so you're not getting over a fully decked out Accesscode Talker or anything, but it works on monsters that are already on the board unlike BTH, doesn't require you to sac anything from your board unlike Kozmojo, and with N'tss as your cost you get an extra destruction on either front or back row unlike Destroyer. Overall I think this is one of your best turn 1 cards to get and even beyond that who can say no to free front and potentially back row removal? Definitely run at 3. If you're feeling skittish about untargetables or stuff that can get over this you can swap out one of the copies of this for <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>, which will generally work better as a single removal and also has the use case of you just want a beatstick on your side of the field for free, but its a SR while this is only an R, and in addition I think the versatility of DP will often make it the better choice. Dropping one of these for IDP would also make it so that you can run 2 of all of your extra deck cards based off of this, which could save you dust in the long run and give you more room for niche usecase cards. It's up to you though as to what you value.  DP tl,dr: use N'tss with this for double the removal on anything 2500 and below, use Wind Peg on anything 2300 and below if your opponent only has the one card out, and above 2500 use Dragon Master/ FGD.  <strong><a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> x2 DROPPED: </strong>Fiendish Chain is a continuous trap card that targets 1 effect monster on the field to negate the effects of and make not able to attack, and if that card is destroyed then destroy this card as well. This card usually just feels like a bad Effect Veiler, but Effect Veiler is a UR and this very much isn't so I have to deal with it. Negating effects is good, and preventing attacks as a bonus is even better, but this card is pretty slow and usually the cards that it's negating don't wind up destroyed, which means that you'll have to play the rest of the game down a backrow slot unless you waste an N'tss or Sliprider on it which usually isn't worth it. Overall I sound very down on this card, but still the truth is its a good card that I always use when I get it.  Chain tl,dr: You should prolly swap this out for other similar cards if you can, but its still pretty good itself and self explanatory in terms of usage.  <strong><a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> x2 ADDED: </strong>Lost Wind is a normal trap card that allows you to target one special summoned monster on the field to negate its effects and halve its original attack, and then if its in the graveyard when a monster is special summoned from your opponents extra deck you can set it again at the cost of it banishing itself when it leaves the field. This card was added to take over the slot that was previously occupied by Fiendish Chain, and  will generally fill the same role as that as a problem monster checker. Almost anything that can give this deck trouble as a monster is going to be special summoned, so its activation requirement is basically a non factor, but not being able to stop your opponent's normal summoned combo starters is rough. There are pros and cons for both halving a monster's original attack vs making them unable to attack, where halving things attack will usually make it so that you can easily get over all but the biggest walls, but the monster still being able to attack at all can be an issue if they're swinging for game, and it only halving original attack means that things like Accesscode Talker and Apollousa aren't going to be affected by this part of the effect, but Accesscode was also a problem for Fiendish Chain since it could out it on reaction with its effect while Appolousa is generally easy enough to get over for this deck. The big sell for this card is it's revival effect when something is special summoned from the extra deck, which is self explanatorily good. Overall this is a very strong card that will almost always be used whenever it finds its way into your hand, and sometimes twice.  Lost Wind tl,dr: Use this to stop problematic monster effects and bring the biggest of bads down a bit in size.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  <strong><a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> x3: </strong>N'tss is a level 4 2500/1200 fusion monster whose materials are 1 synchro+ 1 xyz that must be special summoned from the extra deck by banishing the above materials. Its effect is Once per turn: You can Special Summon 1 Level 4 monster from your hand, If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 card on the field; destroy it, you can only Special Summon ""Elder Entity N'tss(s)"" once per turn. We will never, ever summon this card. That doesn't stop this from being a very important part of the deck to the point that I caved in and crafted this UR. Comboing this off of DP takes it from a single target monster remover to a monster + another monster or backrow remover, which is huge especially since DP is something you will be using most games at least once. This is one of our few backrow removers as well which helps it. Overall this card takes DP from a good to a great card all without taking up a single maindeck slot, which is reason enough for it to be here. I actually ran this at only 1 and thats worked out fine so you could do so too, but I think the potential to use it 3 times is very very strong, especially if you go with 3 PoE's.  N'tss tl,dr: Use this to add a second removal to DP  <strong><a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> x1 CHANGED TO x3: </strong>Wind Peg is a 2300/who cares level 7 synchro that when one of your cards is destroyed by battle or opponent card effect you can banish this from the field or grave to shuffle one card on their field into their deck. 999/1000 times you are only going to use these effects, and only use it off of DP, BUT Ash is technically a tuner, so if you're really being oppressed by an opponents spell/trap you can synchro summon this and then proc it's effect of ""During your Main Phase: You can destroy Spells/Traps your opponent controls, up to the number of ""@Ignister"" monsters you control."" to clear that. Is that the best possible use of Ash? Usually not, but if it could win you the game then its a play you should be aware of the possibility of. Overall this is a cheaper, worse version of N'tss that is worth the 3 extra deck slots if you're going for the PoE's.  Wind Peg tl,dr: Use this to add a delayed second removal to DP that is only an SR, and also possibly synchro summon if you're really in a pickle.  <strong><a data-name=""Five Headed Dragon"">Five-Headed Dragon</a> x2: </strong>FGD is a 5000/who cares that must be fusion summoned. This is a UR but you get 2 of them for free from the Dragon Starter which is why its here, if you don't have that one replace it with Dragon Master Knight which is an R and does the same thing. This is here because it's the strongest extra deck monster and it can't be special summoned from the grave, meaning your opponent cant get cheeky with it after you pop it with DP.  FGD tl,dr: Pop this with DP if you're not popping N'tss  <strong><a data-name=""Dragon Master Knight"">Dragon Master Knight</a> x1 CHANGED TO x3 DROPPED TO x2 CHANGED TO x3: </strong>DMK is a 5000/who cares that must be fusion summoned. This is here because it's the strongest extra deck monster and it can't be special summoned from the grave, meaning your opponent cant get cheeky with it after you pop it with DP. It's only an R, really nothing else is a better use of the extra deck space and making sure that even after PoE you're almost guaranteed to have at least 1 uberbeatstick to proc DP off of so it should be at 3.  DMK tl,dr: Pop this with DP if you're not popping N'tss  <strong><a data-name=""Number 22: Zombiestein"">Number 22: Zombiestein</a> x1 DROPPED: </strong>Zombieman is a 4500/1000 rank 8 xyz that needs 2 level 8 dark's to summon that can negate effects of monsters for 1 turn at the cost of 1 material, 1 discard, and changing this to defense position. This should be used to get over uberbeatsticks with immunity to being popped such as Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon. This obviously seems pretty tricky to get out while theres something like that out, but with E Tele and some luck anything is possible. I only stuck this in cuz I pulled it randomly, but its decent enough at its job that Imma mention it by name here. Feel free to replace with whatever you think would work best at getting over uberbeatsticks here.  Zombieman tl,dr: Use this to get over the biggest of the big  <strong><a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a> x1 DROPPED: </strong>Teardrop is a 2800/2800 rank 8 xyz that requires 2 level 8's to summon that you can detach 1 material from and then target 1 monster on the field to tribute. It also gets 200 atk until the end of the turn for every tributed card. This thing's usecase is to deal with very annoying can't be destroyed by effects that are a bit too big atk wise to go over with Destroyer like the Eldlich's. Once again I only stuck this in cuz I pulled it randomly, but its decent enough at its job that Imma mention it by name here. Feel free to replace with whatever you think would work best at getting over those annoying things here.  Teardrop tl,dr: Use this to get rid of the sticky week old gum that just wont go away.  <strong><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> ADDED x1 DROPPED: </strong>Zeus is a 3000/3000 rank 12 XYZ that can special summon itself on top of an XYZ that has attacked this turn, and has the quick effect to detach 2 materials and send everything else on the field to the graveyard and the effect to add a material to itself from hand/deck/gy if another card of yours is destroyed via battle and card effect. Given that our XYZ's are situational last resorts that are only ever used if things have really hit the fan, this card follows to be even more niche. I only added this because I needed it for another one of my decks, so don't go out crafting this just for this deck it's not worth it. With those being said, holy crap is this card nuts. Non targeting, non destruction OMNI-REMOVAL as a quick effect is something I would have made up as a kid when I'm trying to bs my brother with my random japanese card, and even then there's no way he'd buy that its just too strong. It's attack is good enough to act as a replacement for one Dragon Master Knight, and as a monster that we can actually get out it's automatically more impactful than that, and thats before considering that this card is insane strong once you do get it out. Overall this card is nuts, even if it wont be super common to get it out. Optional but should def be added if you have it.  Zeus tl,dr: Were you pushed into a corner and have to use your XYZ's? Well your opponent is in the corner now staring down a 3k beatstick with no field.  &nbsp;  <strong>Everything else in the extra deck: </strong>I just put in there as filler. Feel free to use whatever you have that you think would work best to cover situations this deck could be weak in. This deck generally doesnt use the extra deck much so it doesn't matter how niche it's usecase would be, as long as you think it could be helpful."

They are my first Fusion and Yu-Gi-Oh deck in general in the TCG and I absolutely love how they can grind and control.  <strong>""Why play Pure Shaddolls over Invoked Shaddolls?""</strong>  • x3 <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> - <span>He is the main reason as to why. He's a graveyard set up, baits three of the most popular hand traps in the current meta game of Master Duel being <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, he's an EARTH attribute, which means you get access to <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>, which also means that you don't have to play <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> if you don't want to. The reason why it's a better bait than <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> is because turn one, passing on <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a> is much better than <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, because your opponent's never gonna waste their <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>s, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>s, or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>s to negate Shekhinaga's effects and what that allows you to do is to be able to set up your graveyard and your field to actually summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> in response to your opponent's card effects that would either Special Summon another card or the monsters themselves. He also draws you a card if he so happened to be destroyed by battle. All of those, you cannot do in Invoked Shaddolls and would require you to hard draw <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> and <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> to continue your usual play with security. Now how exactly does <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> play around being <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>ed or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>d? If your opponent activates either of those two in response to your <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>'s effect, you can chain <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a>, or in a mirror match a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> to summon an <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>, effectively dodging the targeting and make the effect still resolve and since you're going second, if your opponent happens to have an on-board response to him, we're playing triple copies of <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> which enables the same play by sending him to the graveyard as cost but can often be better depending on the board state.</span>  • x2 <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> and x1 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> - <span>Now this is the cute part. Due to the presence of triple <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a>, people have been playing a lot of Drytrons lately. Now, picture this:</span>  <span>Your opponent sets up their whole board, with their graveyard already filled with Drytrons and Ritual monsters. Your opponent activates Meteonis Drytron in an attempt to summon <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a>. You chain <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a> in response (not <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, to play around both <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a>) with <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> access, either on board or hand. At this point, you can decide to activate anything else provided that your opponent passes priority. Chain resolves. You will summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a>, which effectively disables their <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a> and Ritual Summoning in general. In a new chain, since you used <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a> instead of <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, your <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> will be in the graveyard, allowing you to trigger its effect to banish said <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimateness"">Herald of Ultimateness</a> (since all Drytron lists only play one of this), <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a>, and one more card of your choice. This list can easily make an <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a> + <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> set up, so let's assume that you still have it and your opponent still has enough monsters on board to make <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, and obviously, your opponent would wanna make him and they did. Upon the resolution of <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>'s effect to gain ATK, Fusion Summon <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> using either your <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> and use its effect to send the said <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> to the GY.</span>  <span>And let me tell you this: This is usually how it plays out against Drytrons going first. <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> going second is actually stronger than <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> in this build. That's just against ONE match up. What it also allows you to do is to have an insurance, if it ever so happens that your opponent banishes both your first <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> because it can actually recur a copy of herself and your <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a>, because losing both of them in itself effectively cripples your grind game. Your two <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a>s, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a>, and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a> are the core of your resource loop, make sure to take good care of them.</span>  • x3 <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Shaddoll Construct"">Shaddoll Construct</a> - <span><a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> hurts this deck a LOT and if people can run it, they WILL run it, and this card enables you to get around that. That's also why we're using <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, because it plays around said <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>, ALSO it terribly hurts Eldlich and other floodgate decks that don't have <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> specifically.</span>  • The Alternative Win Conditions - <span>The choices of Link 4 monsters will be up to your personal preference, and will usually be between either <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> (arguably the weakest of the four, but can still be good situationally), <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> for OTK, or <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> for protection. The reason as to why I chose the latter is because it's harder to out than the former three and would specifically require a Kaiju to get rid of, and if they did have a Kaiju, it's also a non-targeting, non-destruction removal. <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> is also a great option for this deck, arguably better than <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, especially because we're playing <a data-name=""Shaddoll Core"">Shaddoll Core</a>, because there is a play line that allows you to have access to a set up of <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a>, a set <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a>, and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Core"">Shaddoll Core</a>. What it allows you to do is to continuously loop <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> from the graveyard (in which you summoned during your turn previously) to negate a face-up card on the field, be it an effect monster that can be targeted or an annoying Field Spell/Floodgate, and triggering <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a>'s effect to destroy all monsters on the field whenever a monster is Special Summoned to a ANY zone a Link monster points to, maximum four times per turn only enabled by your set spells and traps and if you're playing <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> instead of <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, not yet including your opponent's Special Summons. <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> also allows it so that he is protected against <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>. I used to do this a lot against Dragon Link and Salamangreat and it's absolutely hilarious.</span>  Overall, it's a pretty straightforward build of Shaddolls and if you might have noticed, this is basically just three Shaddoll Showdown Structure decks with Link Monsters and staples. Enjoy!"

You can basically print Links for free with this deck which is why you can pull out Accesscode Talker for a very strong finisher. The main combo you want to get started on your first turn is as follows: Ideally your starting hand has at least 2 Prank-Kids Cards with one of them being a Monster. Summon your Prank-Kids monster and Link it into Meow-Meow, then after you special summon your next Prank-Kids Monster link those two into Dodo-Doodle-Doo so you can either grab Prank-Kids Pranks if you don't already have it or Prank-Kids Place. after you have Prank-Kids Pranks and Dodo-Doodle-Doo, use Prank-Kids Pranks to summon your Prank-Kid Token and Link into Bow-Wow-Bark. If possible on your first turn you want to fusion summon Weather-Washer pointing off of your Bow-Wow-Bark, and this will be your main Board setup. Having Weather-Washer on the Board will give your Prank-Kids Monsters some form of protection during the Battle Phase. After you have your Board set up you can either summon Accesscode Talker if you think you can finish them off that turn, or if you feel less confident about lethal you can pull out some fusion Monsters to buff up your Monsters from the effect of Prank-Kids Place. Whenever you activate Fansies' effect you want to send Prank-Kids Plan to the Graveyard to Cycle back the Monsters in your Graveyard. Whenever you activate Rocksies' effect you should banish an artifact Monster if there are more than you need in your hand, or a Mirror force if it isn't serving any purpose at the moment. You can swap out the Artifact Monsters for Hand Traps like Cherry Blossom, but I personally just like Artifact Monsters."

He who likes the summoning of monsters through Fusion. Back with another Eldlich deck profile but this time, it's not necessarily budget but a more concentrated one. Extra Deck Eldlich, to be more specific.  Before anything else, I wanna make it clear that this is NOT the stun variant of Eldlich that runs three copies of <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, but instead a more reactive and interactive Extra Deck variant so if you're looking for the latter, this is not that type of deck.  The non-standard stuff:  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> - Despite what the category states, three of this one is absolutely mandatory, including your one copy of <a data-name=""Golden Land Forever!"">Golden Land Forever!</a>. I can never stress this enough, you NEED protection against <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> is just, whatever.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> - Not only do you need protection against it, you also need it in case your opponent decides to make you go second. Arguably the best board wipe in the game, even better than the overrated <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> that's a UR, btw.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a> - You need interaction against back row, in addition to your <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. You can't rely on just one form of removal. This can also save your Golden Land and Eldlixir traps from <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> by chaining it and destroying those.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> - The second best form of removal in the game. It does not target, it does not destroy, and it's banishing is optional.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> - This card, alongside <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> is just pure cheat code. It's basically a <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, but better. You can use it as a discard fodder for your <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>, and it'll just reset itself on to the field as soon as your opponent Special Summons an Extra Deck monster.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a> - Better than <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> or even <a data-name=""Karma Cut"">Karma Cut</a>. It does not discard for cost, it's a generic face-up banishing removal, it can also be a body on board. It's wonderful. Also a body on board for purposes that we'll address later.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> - The second boss monster of the deck. This deck is the reason why you'll never run out of <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> and <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a> because during your opponent's Standby Phases, you can return a banished copy of them back to the graveyard. That's insane. You can also just pitch this card to the graveyard for your <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> and it can recycle back one of the cards in the graveyard, including itself, and this is not a once per turn effect.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a> - Just a beat stick in case you locked yourself out of attacking with the <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a>. And he's free.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a> - An even bigger beat stick that can interrupt your opponent by not necessarily negating the effects of your opponent's monsters, but banishes them.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Colossal Fighter&lt;/span&gt;"">Colossal Fighter</a> - This spot is absolutely free. I only chose this because it's a monster that keeps coming back and isn't a once per turn.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Armades, Keeper of Boundaries"">Armades, Keeper of Boundaries</a>, <a data-name=""Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon"">Adreus, Keeper of Armageddon</a>, and <a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a> - Armades makes landing game ending attacks easier, Catastor gets rid of problematic non-DARK monsters without targeting, and Adreus is a generic spot removal and holds your Golden Land monsters as well to slow down the tempo of the game. You don't want Eldlich to speed through your in-archetype Traps. Any of their slots can be flex spots.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Crimson Knight Vampire Bram"">Crimson Knight Vampire Bram</a> - This card is funny. He's a Zombie type monster, which means <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> won't lock you out of attacking with him, he has 2500 ATK which is pretty sizeable. He can steal monsters from your opponent's graveyard, and if your opponent for some reason happens to have some <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a> or any boss monster just chillin' in there like <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> for example, you can just yoink it. He also brings himself back during the next Standby Phases after the turn he was destroyed, and all it takes to make him is your Conquistador and Huaquero, which shouldn't be difficult.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"">Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</a> - He's technically a floodgate, and is a pretty sizeable beat stick at 2200 ATK (can crash with <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, pog), and most importantly, he's a Zombie type monster.</span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Sky Cavalry Centaurea"">Sky Cavalry Centaurea</a> - If this card is good enough to out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, it's good enough for decks that can make it that does not have those incredible boss monsters. This monster is the main reason why I'm running <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a> and <a data-name=""Paleozoic Canadia"">Paleozoic Canadia</a>.</span>  <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Paleozoic Marella"">Paleozoic Marella</a> - This card is just free Eldlich set up. It dumps a trap card from your deck to the GY. ANY trap card. Also a free body for your Synchro and Xyz plays.</span>  Everything else should be pretty obvious. I mean, it's Eldlich. You can cut cards that you don't like or don't have access to yet. Nothing much else to say about it. Enjoy climbing."

By no means do I believe Eldlich is a dead deck despite potentially losing a power 1-of, I think for a returning player or someone wanting to go from being ""casual"" to having a ""locals"" or potentially higher in certain metas level deck, this is an extremely safe deck to play, learn and get used to the game.  While not being Extra Deck reliant, you still definitely have the opportunity to access some real haymakers such as Zeus or Ningirsu and the sheer advantage engine granted by the natural progression of the game through using stuff like your Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine and Conquistador's graveyard effects really keep you going strong without a great deal of worry. However, one must take time with all decks like this to learn when to use their resources and maintain that advantage engine to avoid burning themselves out at the crucial moments of the game.  Edit: It appears Eldlich got even better than before."

Currently Plat II with 52 wins and 10 losses.,"I've tried to adapt my TCG list into Master Duels. By only playing this deck, I've reached Plat II with 52 wins and 10 losses.  One thing that I really dislike is the fact that it seems like you have to play Maxx C in this format. Without it you will have a rough time playing against all the combo decks. I think its also mandatory to play 3x Ash and 2x Called By because of the fact that your opponent could have his own Maxx C in his hand.  My thought process building this deck was to make the deck as consistent as it can be in the BO1 format with a ban list that has Nadir Servant at 1 and Magical Meltdown at 2. This is why I use 3x Pot of Prosperity with only 5 Shaddoll Monsters. You really dont want them to brick you because it can be a really hard game if you start with 2-3 Shaddols in your hand. Also I've cut out the one copy of Ariel because it hasn't seen much use besides being a normal summon to go into Almiraj to get your Maximus going.  The extra deck has some choices that I'm still testing. <ol>  	<li>First things first. I would never cut the 2nd Mechaba or Winda. You will need 2 Mechabas in a lot of duels while having 2 Windas helps you to combo with your 1st Winda to go into your 2nd one on the next turn using Shaddoll Schism.</li>  	<li>Yes I am playing the one copy of Magellanica as a huge Beatstick can be enough to ruin your enemys day in Master Duels. Also it's a good target for Super Polymerization against decks like Tri Brigade. It can also be used with the enemys Maxx C from the grave so you can make this guy really often.</li>  	<li>Starvin Venom Fusion Dragon can come in clutch but wont come out in the most duels.</li>  	<li>Cards that you could cut from the extra deck in my opinion: Pugatrio, Raidjin, Starvin Venom Fusion Dragon, Magellanica</li>  	<li>Cards that you could add to the extra deck in my opinion: 2nd Apkallone, 2nd N'tss, Mudragon of the Swamp</li> </ol> There are still a lot of possibilitys on how you can adapt the deck. <ol>  	<li>Play 2x Dogmatika Maximus becuase Nadir Servant is at 1</li>  	<li>Cut out one Shaddoll Fusion because the Shaddoll package is really small und play a lot vs stuff like Eldlich</li>  	<li>Put in something like Harpyies Feather Duster or LS to have an easier time vs Eldlich, etc. (I think the deck still perfoms really good against Eldlich without those but it will help in the matchup)</li>  	<li>Use Nibiru instead of Maxx C for another Light monster to go into Mechaba or Construct</li> </ol>"

An incredible anti-meta rogue deck, Generaider Windwitch slow","I achieved Platinum 1 rank with Generaider Windwitch 01/24/2022 with a 70%-ish winrate, consistently taking down decks like Shadoll-Invoked, Sky Striker, Tribrigade and Adamancipators!  If you want a detailed explanation how to use this deck, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/generaider-windwitch-july-2021/"">click here.</a>  This deck features incredibly potent anti-meta cards like Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Imperial Order and True King of Calamities. Generaider Windwitch plays comfortably under these floodgates, while the opponent keels over and dies. If you have access to any of these cards, they generally insta-win you the game since they shut off almost every route of play.  While preferring to go first, this deck can still comfortably go second if forced to, since it features 12 hand traps. It can also play past interruption, since it has multiple methods to start off its gameplay.  I found it funny that almost nobody knows what the heck Generaiders and Windwitches do, and they end up underestimating the deck until it's too late. Before long, your opponent may find themself facing down Harr's omni-negate, Crystal Wing's monster negate, Dimension Shifter's banish, and lethal backrow like Judgment and Imperial Order!  Another bonus about this deck is that it functions nicely under Maxx ""C,"" the undisputed king of Master Duel. This deck doesn't summon much, so the opponent doesn't have much incentive to use Maxx ""C."" This deck can even function under Summon Limit or Winda!  The only major problem about this deck is that it bricks HARD, since there are 6 ""hard"" bricks in the deck (5 Generaider bosses + Ice Bell) and 1 ""soft"" brick (Glass Bell).

Main strategy revolves around utilizing Soulpiercer to draw the cards you need to summon Benkei (Flutist if Benkei is in hand, Peacemaker if not). Also using battleball to tribute opponent's monster for your synchros, especially any of their level 10's to summon Steamtrain.</span>  <span>Brute force your way to a win with big damage by utilizing Horns and/or Soulshield on Benkei or any high level synchro. This can be particularly effective with Stealth Ninja's direct attack.</span>  <span>Never be quick to surrender with this deck, if i've learned anything using it in 100's of duels, it's the amount of surprising comeback victories it can achieve, don't be afraid to grind things out, one card can make all the difference.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Key points:</span></strong>  <span>. Gigagloves, Brawler and Swordsman make for great stall tactics.</span>  <span>. Get your Gigagloves, Flutists and Soulpiercers into the GY ASAP for their effects.</span>  <span>. Waraji and Transporter can always be special summoned at any time during main phases, combine this with Trumpeter's special summon or Fist's GY effect for quick synchro summons. Magnet can be also be useful here as your normal summon, depending on your hand.</span>  <span>. Use Peacemaker tribute effect on Gigagloves, Flutist or Soulpiercer preferably.</span>  <span>. Save your equip cards for Benkei or synchros.</span>  <span>. Shutendoji is essential for going second and wiping out your opponent's backrow or field spells.</span>  <span>. Stealth Ninja can direct attack, make use of this to divert flip effects or effects that occur when opponent's monster is battled.</span>  <span>. Sarutobi and Thief can be used in a pinch to destroy opponent's spells/traps, should Shutendoji fail.</span>  <span>. Thief and Susanowo can steal opponent's spells/traps from field/graveyard for your own use, or simply to prevent the opponent from using them or activating their effects in the GY.</span>  <span>. Musashi is generally used only in a combo to retrieve the quick special summon cards from your graveyard (Waraji, Trumpeter etc)  to summon higher level synchros, don't use him for battle unless you need to.</span>  <span>. Flutist can summon Benkei directly from your hand. Peacemaker can summon Benkei from your deck by attaching to and tributing any of your monsters. Waraji can be used as '2 tributes' to summon Benkei.</span>  <span>. Whenever you have a chance to summon Steamtrain, do so.</span>  <span>. Protect your high level monsters from battle or card effect destruction with Soulbeads and Soulfire Suit.</span>  <span>. Remember that Stealth Ninja revives itself from the GY at the start of your turn if it was destroyed by card effect, save cards in your hand for a comeback if you expect this.</span>  <span>. Drum can be used as an offbeat tuner, or to revive a fallen boss monster.</span>  <span>. Scarecrow can be used for an emergency revival of a boss monster, as well as potentially get a Flutist or Gigagloves in your GY simultaneously. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Key weaknesses:</span></strong>  <span>. Skill Drain, Forbidden Chalice, or any effect negation</span>  <span>. Effects which alter battle position and/or prevent position from being altered (Enemy Controller, etc)</span>  <span>. Effects that target defense position monsters (Dark Mirror Force, Ehren Lightsworn Monk, Red Dragon Archfiend, Number 21 etc)</span>  <span>. Mystic Mine can shut this deck down completely.</span>  &nbsp;"

It's very hard for opponent to deal with 1 or 2 Borrelswords that dont get destroyed by effects or battle. Hence, Immortal FurHire!  We dont counter Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler there's ways to do that but it's not worth putting in deck to counter Ash Blossom or Veiler. Less consistent if we add cards to counter it.  Added 3 copies of I:P Masquerena so you can protect all 3 copies of your Borrelsword Dragon (You need that for clever opponents) from Effects so it won't be destroyed by both Card Effects and Battle. Masquerena also allows you to point a link so you can use World Legacy Succession to SS Borrelsword from GY in case it does get wiped somehow. Added protection.  Added 3 copies of Maxx 'C' because every deck in rank is SS turn 1 or 2. This draws you lots of cards if its in your opening hand.  Updated - Now has a ton more GY recursion + More Summons up to 26 for consistency. There's too much control decks floating around with tons of Board Wipes you need to be able to recover your Borrelsword from GY if this happens or you loose 4 summons.  100% Consistent. That's the idea of the wins you'll get. Ez GG's. Since every card in your deck SS to board +1 plus GY recursion."

This and other things have became a passionate hobby to me so in this context the  Paleozoic Frog deck appears to me the most.</span>  <span>The Paleozoic cards are almost an ideal representation of  animals that once lived on Earth( in the  Cambrian Period), so well detailed  which got me in love. So enough about boring stuff and let's get into the deck.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>One to rules them All</span>  <span>The paleozoic  Frog  is a strategy  based in a control type of deck using traps ( and occasionally handtraps) as the main resource of such action. The majority of Paleozoic archetype are trap </span><span>cards</span><span>  with a variety of effects, while having a gimmick to summon themself as a monster (AQUA levEl 2 , 1200 ATK/ 0 DEF) in a CL1 with a trap. Frogs are level 2 AQUA monster which have the ability to swarm the field fast as they can, while aiming to go for the big guy of their archetype Toadally Awesome (what a goof name), a Rank 2 aqua monster with a totally awesome omni negate effect.</span>  <span>Both engines were born to be together, they are so complementary for each other that makes a fearsome rogue strategy.</span>  <span>Who is who on Cruj (a silly brazilian joke)</span>  <span>Frogs everywhere</span>  <span>3x</span> <b>Swap Frog</b><span>: Our silly boy , swap frog is the heart and soul for the frog engine. First of all , the first effect ( a frog's  Foolish burial when it's summoned) is not  once per turn, so you can bounce itself for an additional Gy set up,  like  a </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span> and a  </span><b>Dupe frog</b><span>. You can even use the </span><b>Toadally</b><b> Awesome</b><span> effect to summon Swap frog from the deck  to extend your play to go in a second Toadally Awesome.</span>  <span>3x </span><b>Dupe frog</b><span>: A control's  graduated, this cute little frog is our food for </span><b>Swap frog</b><span> and</span><span>  </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span>  to work well. It has a second major effect  to add a frog monster to your hand from deck which is good also because you can use it to go in a link monster  (</span><b>Marincess Coral Anemone</b><b> or </b><b>Mista boy</b><span>)</span>  <span>2x </span><b>Ronintoadin</b><span> : This wanna-be samurai can be summoned from your  Gy banning  a  frog card and that's not a once per turn effect. The swarm ability  of this card is incredible.</span>  <span>3x </span><b>Toadally Awesome</b><span>: A XYZ monster with so much power. These little bastards can detach  a material to summon a frog from the deck , tribute an Aqua monster to negate ANY effect and  if  they go to Gy , can recover a  water monster( itself or another frog). The scariest part is that none of these effects are ""hard"" once per turn ( in other word, if you have more than one on field you can use  this effect again), making this card a fearsome entity. If  you have(as I have)</span> <b>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</b><span>, this card becomes  even scarier.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Honorary Frogs</span>  <span>2x </span><span>Marincess Coral Anemone</span><span>: An Idol makes an appearance in this deck. She is a brilliant extender, you can  use </span><span> Swap frog </span><span>to send </span><span>Dupe frog</span><span> to GY , bounce itself to send a </span><span>Ronintoadin</span><span>  to Gy, use the </span><span>Ronintoadin</span><span> to summon it  and go into  Marincess Coral Anemone summon again </span><span>Swap frog</span><span> from Gy. using another time it effects sending another  dupe frog to bring Ronintoadin once more to go into </span><span>Toadally Awesome</span><span>... phew... </span><span>Marincess Coral Anemone</span><span> is insane...</span>  <span>1x </span><span>Mista boy</span><span>: one of the elemental links , it can boost </span><span>Toadally Awesome</span><span> and if goes to gy , recover any water monster.</span>  <span>1x </span><span>Cat Shark</span><span> : A rank 2 XYZ cute fellow can boost even more the atk of </span><span>Toadally Awesome</span><span>.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Cambrian period</span>  <span>2x </span><span>Paleozoic Pikaia</span><span> : </span><b><i>Pikaia </i></b><span> is an extinct, primitive  animal known from the Middle Cambrian that looks like an Eel.

This is not as impactful as a  Solemn Strike,however it breaks the  tempo of your opponent and this is the most important thing.</span>  <span>3x </span><span>Paleozoic Dinomischus</span><span> : </span><b><i>Dinomischus</i></b> <span>is a rare fossil animal from the Cambrian period, looking like an  actinia or  a Jellyfish offspring. Our Dinomischus is an insane card that can banish any face-up card of the field and, like  Pikaia,  can set the Gy with any card.

We just got a few of those off of the banlist that just came out (although I'm not a fan of the list overall). Destrudo allows for some synchro 7 plays like dawn dragster going first and black rose going second, and snow is really strong sense you should have a full graveyard at almost all times. Hydralander is one of the centerpieces of the deck, it's a big body that has a quick effect mill 3 and pop, the drawback being that you can't have any monsters with the same name in the graveyard, another reason snow is so good is that it can help manipulate the grave to get out duplicates of those cards. Over the past few banlists BA has also gotten some major unhits in the forms of three tour guide, cir, and graff. Sekka is a crazy draw spell that is pot of greed and upstart goblin in the same card, but with the major drawback of it being the only piece of backrow you can play for the game, it's at one right now so you won't find it always, but it's still very powerful. the dangers provide extra draw power and extension.

Starters for Combos: Pikari @Ignister, AIMeet, any @Ignister level 4 or below monster+AILand. Try to get to your Avramax as fast as possible if going first, if going second get to Darkfluid+Accesscode fast. It's really easy but you need to do it by some knowledge. The deck doesn't require to much skill for ok board, but does require skill for good board. The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister is second best first turn monster, but Avramax is slightly better 'cuz of it's effect."

Main deck is missing Liquid Solider (need to buy), so swap him for Ocean. Playing 2x Solid Soldier to compensate for -1x Fusion Destiny on Feb 2022 banlist. The idea is that you can leverage the Solid Soldier’s ability to double-summon to go straight into Verte, straight into DPE. From there, you’re off and running with normal Hero combos. Depending on the hand going first, it’s not too hard to get around hand traps with back-up options."

Like a whole lot. But its hard and just isn't getting any easier so far, so to make things more fluid for me i added a Halqifibrax combo that end with 2 negates and 1 floodgate.  &nbsp;  2 card combo: <a data-name=""Black Metal Dragon"">Black Metal Dragon</a> + any dragon extender.  Normal summon Black Metal ~Link summon <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> using Black Metal ~Chain link 1 Black Metal and link 2 Striker, adding in sequence <a data-name=""Boot Sector launch"">Boot Sector launch</a> and <a data-name=""Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a> (if you have <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a> in hand special summon it now) ~(if you didn't special summoned Noctovision but have <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> in hand use it now[Boot sector can also be used as a extender]) Link summon <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Romulus"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus</a> using Striker and the dragon extender, Romulus add <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a> (if you used Noctovision for the link summon you can chainblock) ~activate Dragon Ravine, trigger it effect to discard a card and send <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> to the GY ~Romulus already did his job so special summon Darkness Metal by banishing him ~activate Darkness Metal effect to special a Dragon <strong>tuner </strong>from your graveyard ~take a breath ~link Summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> using Darkness Metal and the tuner ~Halqifibrax special summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> from your deck or hand ~Link summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> using you know what ~Auroradon will summon 3 tokens and after that summon 001 from your Graveyard ~synchro summon <a data-name=""Cupid Pitch"">Cupid Pitch</a> Using a token and 001 ~Activate Auroradon and tribute 2 tokens to special summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a> from your deck ~Coltwing will summon 2 tokens and after that summon 001 by the last time ~Synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> using Cupid Pitch and a token ~Chain Savage and Cupid effects. Add <a data-name=""Creation Resonator"">Creation Resonator</a> from your deck to your hand ~special summon said Resonator ~Synchro summon <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> using the Resonator and Coltwing* (Coltwing is now level 7 because there's only one token in the board) ~activate Destrudo in the Graveyard and Target <strong>Deskbot 001* </strong>(if you target the token you won't get Shenshen but <a data-name=""Dawn Dragster"">Dawn Dragster</a>) ~Synchro summon Shenshen using Destrudo and the token.  The result isn't as impressive as it's long, but, to me, is easier to remember than pure dragon link ever-adapting combos. Although that you can play like a normal dragon link deck to some extent if you need to play around something like nibiru or if you draw Coltwing (Coltwing is the only Brick in this deck).  I tested other extenders like Ready Fusion but i decided to preserve the extra deck as it is now.  !Update: added a new line for the combo. Now instead of targeting <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> with <a data-name=""Destrudo"">Destrudo</a> you can target the Auroradon token and make <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> that will send <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow to the GY"">Fairy Tail - Snow to the GY</a>.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome.  GLHF"

Just stop after summoning Gactos, they'll get a draw but you're likely to have Bashelios or a few S/T for protections.</li>  	<li>Make your opponent think they should worry about a card like Meteoragon, so they'll focus on outing it by battle only for you to buff more with Wento</li>  	<li>Another bait is to get your opponent to negate the wrong monster. Fortia and Orpis are the biggest offenders. Everyone knows that Fortia searches, but Orpis' effect to send Bashelios to the GY and then summon can win you a game by ATKing directly for 2900+</li>  	<li>Activate Mountain first when you plan on crashing Fortia/Orpis for a search. If your opponent has an Ash, then they'll use it on Mountain because that the ""Money Card"" and if they don't then that means you get a free Meteoragon in the Battle Phase</li>  	<li>Everyone expects Imperm to be in the middle, place it right of the middle</li>  	<li>If you have 2 traps + Imperm, don't set Imperm. You don't want to risk Harpie'</li> </ul> Turn 2: UNGA BUNGA <ul>  	<li>When ATKing, remember to use your level 4/5's first THEN activate Skylar. She prevents you from ATKing with lv5 or lower monsters once activated</li>  	<li>Yes. Meteoragon is not a hard OPT.</li>  	<li>Yes. Meteoragon does negate a monster's ATK bonus like Accesscode</li>  	<li>Yes. Meteoragon does negate ""Cannot be destroyed by battle or Card effects""</li>  	<li>2x Magnum Shield + Bashelios = 8700 direct ATK</li>  	<li>Save Bashelios to ATK last just in case</li> </ul> Final Remarks: <ul>  	<li>I'd play 3x Solemn Judgement but I just don't for 0 reason.

But playing it, the deck offers a lot of variety. There are plenty of ways to either chainblock or dodge a handtrap. The order in which you summon your birds can be changed up to bait negates. All of that may not sound like the plays differ much from one another and they don't, but you do get a kick out of every first turn hand since the way you'll handle your turn and the decisions you make differ every time.  Journey Preparations (Advent of Adventure) gave this deck both a searcher and a way to play through interaction in one, banishing one to chainblock or chaining it to an Imperm to dogde it.  In current build people usually play 3 Book of Moon and Gold Sarcophagus but Advent achieves both while also boosting consistency.  Dimension Shifter is one heck of a handtrap and Floowandereeze can activate it multiple times as they usually keep their GY empty. Even if they don't, Stri can banish whatever's in there.  Also their design is fantastic. Not only the monsters themselves but the way the entire background is utilizes to create awesome card design is great. The floodgate effect of Empen is also not too strong and designed in a way in which a floodgate is acceptable."

Here's the list of my going second Invoked Dogmatika Shaddolls, Master Duel legal. Your going first choices will be in the main and your going second options will be at the side deck. I wanna keep it as concise as possible so, let's get to it. (Edit: There might've been a small rant somewhere in there so, yeah... oops.)  • ""Where Maximus? modcheck"" - <span>Yeah, we're not playing <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> because Drytrons are annoying as fuck and should get hit whenever a ban list comes in Master Duel. Why you wouldn't wanna do this? They play <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>. Also, Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades, they also have <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager"">Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager</a> which can search upon getting sent to the GY and <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</a> which draws, and both triggers off of Maximus' effect. That's absolutely terrible for you. That's also why I prefer <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> in this build instead of the usual <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> + <a data-name=""Secure Gardna"">Secure Gardna</a>. Not only is it cheaper to build this way and leaves you one Extra Deck slot to work with, but it's one less summon for <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. He would be better in a format where Drytrons and Tri-Brigades are dead, which is why I haven't played Master Duel for a while and went back to the TCG for some breath of fresh air, because his main purpose is to kill your opponent's Extra Deck. This is also why we're not running <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> and <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, because sending it off <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> would be too slow, and you'd much rather send either an <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> or a <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>.</span>  <span><span>• ""Double Resh?"" -</span> Yes. That's standard for my builds. I disagree with playing just one of this card, and in a format where <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is only semi-limited, there's really no reason not to run an extra copy for insurance.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell"">Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</a> -</span> One of the most underrated Counter Traps in the game, like holy shit. You can effectively disable three different Spells for the rest of the DUEL, in a best of one format. If you're playing against Drytrons and you chain this in response to their <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a>, that means they cannot Ritual Summon AT ALL for the rest of that duel. That's <strong>STUPID </strong>and I love it. We're playing 12 Spells to fodder this Trap, and this can also act as a Trap fodder for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> for coverage. BUT if you have access to triple <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>s or <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>s, you can do it. I'll just leave this up to your preference.</span>  <span><span>• x3 <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> -</span> This is a staple for my builds so long as it's still a best of one format, especially on going second decks. This is harder to play around than <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, which is a UR btw. This, <a data-name=""Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell"">Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell</a>, and <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>/<a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> can all share slots, so it really depends on you on how many ratios of them you can or want to play.</span>  <span><span>• <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> -</span> Thunder Dragons are (usually) a Fusion strategy, and I LOVE and respect Fusion strategies due to them being innately -1 or 2 but still keeping up with the meta game from time to time, but I too can make exceptions. Pardon my language, but I FUCKING HATE <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> with a fervent passion comparable to that of Payne96' desire for a Pyro/Volcanic support coming into the TCG/OCG. I am not sorry for these Thunder Dragon players but Colossus should never come back to the TCG and should be banned in Master Duel as well, I'd even say that that card should have never been printed alongside <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and I will literally fight you for it. You can argue the same thing for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> all you want, but she does not have protection like Colossus does and is frail in comparison. Also Prank-Kids, you might've noticed by now how I hate decks that gain so much advantage off of so little resources.</span>  <span><span>• <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> -</span> For Drytrons and Tri-Brigades. They both usually have cards that fits <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>'s requirements. Also, there have been some EARTH Machines and rogue strategies with EARTH and WATER attributes lurking around lately, that's also why I'm playing <a data-name=""Nehshaddoll Genius"">Nehshaddoll Genius</a>. She's an additional negate for the turn, and if you too decide to run her, you have the freedom to either choose x2 Apkallone or one of each Apkallone and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>. Also, both it and Shekhinaga gets better if you decided to use <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> instead, I only chose <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> instead of it or <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> because one, Drytrons would rather be Ashed than Drolled because the latter would mean they would have to use all of the resources they have currently to make a play if they don't have an immediate answer to it, unlike <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> which can be both countered by Ash, <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>, and <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> and two, not a lot of FIRE Attributed decks are around like Infernoble Knights or Salamangreats and three, I've been hunting these Lyrilusc Tri-Brigades in the ladder like Kite Tenjo hunting Number cards. I would run three <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wend"">Reeshaddoll Wendi</a> if <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> were at three as well.</span>  Some additional notes:  • <strong>Match your Extra Deck with your hand traps</strong> - <span>If you do decide to play <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> would be nice to have for additional firepower since this deck has already more than enough control to it. That's also why I don't play <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>, because there are times where I've dragged games way too long with locking my opponent down with it, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>, and <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> on board, but I too find myself having trouble of dealing damage. I have considered several times to play <a data-name=""Invoked Cocytus"">Invoked Cocytus</a>, but he's just not worth it as of now, if you want a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target for WATER Attributes, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> would be better because not only does she cut off Drytron from their gimmick, but she also stops the second part of <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Bird Call"">Lyrilusc - Bird Call</a> and in mirror matches, this turns off Resh Shaddoll Incarnation, so whoever has the more established boards usually would win.</span>  <span>• Most decks in the ladder do not have an out to a <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as Link Material, with the exception of <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</a>, and some rogue strategies like Mekk-Knights because they play <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> and some that run Kaijus but in my opinion, this is the best defensive Link 4 you can have, but if you want more firepower then look for either <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> or <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>. You can also choose to run <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> instead for more disruption.</span>  Overall, it's a pretty standard Invoked Dogmatika Shaddoll deck list with some personal techs. A third copy of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> would definitely be nice but, it is what it is. It's not exactly a cheap deck to build due to Konami deciding to make the three main Shaddoll Fusion monsters all URs for some reason, but I do hope you enjoy playing this deck if you ever decide to do so."

You can use Foolish Burial, One for One, Tuning (Send the top card of you deck the GY), Quickdraw Synchron, or Mathematician to send a Doppelwarrior to the GY for Junk Synchron to special summon.  From there you synchro summon Junk Speeder, into Martial Metal Marcher and Armory Arm.  Then, you can summon Cosmic Blazar Dragon.  If you have non-tuner monsters left or monster reborn I like to go for Stardust Dragon or Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.  There are still some cards I am on the fence about having in the deck and I hope to find more impactful cards as I continue to play and experiment.  That being said here are a few cards I would switch for something else;  -Turbo Booster and Boost Warrior (I like these cards in case you are unable to get a Doppelwarrior to the GY)  -Necroid Synchro (not a great card for opener, but I find it useful to get Shooting Star Dragon out)  -Shard of Greed (two turns is too slow in today's Yu-Gi-Oh I'm learning)  -Martial Metal Marcher (Tatsunoko seems to the popular 3 star synchro tuner, I will test out to see which I prefer),  -Armory Arm ( probably better 4 star synchro monsters out there, my nostalgia for the card  keeps it in the deck for me.  Also, the extra attack it gives helps deal with decks like Blue-Eyes that have high attack monsters)  -Beelzeus of the Diabolic Dragons (I wanted a 10 star synchro in my extra deck and this seemed like the best one.  I have haven't summoned as many times as I'd like to though)  Thanks again for viewing/reading and I would appreciate it if everyone would leave there thoughts or recommendations for this deck.  I am still learning about the cards that have come out since I last play Yu-Gi-Oh and am having a lot of fun duelling again.  I hope you enjoy this deck or are able to get some ideas for your decks from it."

It's basically classic dragon link, taking advantage of the unlimited striker dragon and whit","Due to the best of one format in Master duel you have to play hand traps main.  In order to not loose to much of the insane extending potential of dragon link i feel like only dark/light hand traps can be used. By choosing mostly light ones the deck actually gets quite close to a normal chaos light/dark ratio which makes it consistent in terms of using chaos space, chaos ruler and the black/white dragon.  That's the reason even tho max C is insane I chose to not play it due to it being earth typing.  The one ash main could be replaced with any other handtrap you feel worth playing and nib could be replaced with psyframe"

Build your board with the following combos: <ul>  	<li>Gearframe-unclaspare (super useful for xyz summons, summon gear gigant x and draw what u need. I usually draw resavenger ( the only archetype's handtrap) after setting my board to activate it during the opponent's battlephase.);</li>  	<li>irradiator-megaform (one of the most important combos! sp summon the first discarding the second thx to his effect, use the first's effect to summon the second from gy, tribute the second thx to its effects to sp summon what u need. Careful this cambos has unlimited possibilities use ur immagination to win the game with it!!!

Most of them have 1850ATK or 1500DEF which is specific for being able to search for them in decks and in GYs. Majority of Victories come from swinging wildly with the spellcasters or having your opponent surrender because you hindered them enough.  <strong>STAPLES: -</strong>Raigeki/Lightning Storm/Veiler/AshBlossom/Terraforming/MST/Dimensional Barrier - Pretty self explanatory, feel free to add/remove as you see fit.  <strong>LUNA: </strong>-A simple way of getting spellcaster cards into your hand from your deck with 1850ATK; which is all the Familiar Possessed creatures. Can also be used to disrupt your opponent by forcing them to trash a card or have cards sent back to their hands/ExtraDeck  <strong>DOGMATIKA:</strong> -Ecclesia and Fluerdelis are easy summons in reaction to your opponents summoning from the extra deck, they are also Spellcasters and they are annoying to deal with.  <strong>EDA:</strong> -Helpful for special summoning cards from your Deck; they come in in Facedown defense position, but during your opponents main phase you can flip them to attack.  <strong>NEFARIOUS </strong>-This is a combo piece; if you have a spellcaster in the field, you can special summon this, which then you special summon <strong>Awakened Nefarious </strong>from your deck by sending both the small nefarious and spellcaster card to the GY. Once <strong>Awakened Nefarious</strong> enters the battlefield you can bring back a spellcaster monster from your GY to your field. I run only one because you do not want this in your opening hand.  <strong>ICHIRIN </strong>-I use this field spell if I'm playing against another spellcaster deck, otherwise I prioritize <strong>Secret Village.</strong>  <strong>AWAKENING OF THE POSSESSED </strong>-This is IMO the most important card in the deck which is why I run three. It draws you a card when you play a spellcaster. it powers up all you cards based on the different attributes in play (why I run one copy of every Familiar Possessed). With this in play, your creatures will hit like trucks and since there are many ways to get creatures in play, you can overwhelm your opponent on power alone.  <strong>SPIRIT CHARMER </strong>-I always add a spellcaster to my hand and I always set an <strong>Awakening of the possessed.</strong>  <strong>POSSESSED PARTNERSHIPS </strong>-This card is loaded: Summon a spellcaster from hand or GY, destroy a face-up card, and banish it to recycle a previous spell or trap and play them in face-up position.  <strong>UNPOSSESSED </strong>-Protects your familiar possessed creatures, powers them up on attack, if a creature is destroyed you can special summon a new one. Very useful in this deck.  <strong>THE EXTRA DECK</strong> -Pretty straight forward, used them to get a nice creature from your opponents GY that matches the attribute (there is no dark version yet)  I made this deck cuz I like the archetype, but it has shocked me how well it's doing; to the point where I'm in Platinum in MasterDuel."

While that's still far away the new cards have been announced for quite a while now, giving us plenty of time to deckbuild, test ratios and optimize the new era of Marincess decks</span>.  <span>Marincess</span>  <span>Marincesses are a link climbing deck that aims to create an unaffected boss monster. Like every link archetype it has a Link-1 that searches the Field Spell. The Field Spell -</span> <span><a data-name=""Marincess Battle Ocean"">Marincess Battle Ocean</a></span><span> - gives the boss monster a huge ATK boost (up to 2000) and makes it unaffected if summoned with</span> <span><a data-name=""Marincess Crystal Heart"">Marincess Crystal Heart</a></span><span>. Since Marincess end in a high ATK monster that's equiped with even more monsters players can be caught off guard and don't realise all they have to do is out the field spell to remove the monsters protection and ATK buff.</span> <span><a data-name=""Marincess Wave"">Marincess Wave</a></span> <span>is another means to protect your monsters. It both negates an opponent's monster and makes all your monster unaffected by your opponent's card effects. If you control a Link-3 or higher Marincess it turns into a handtrap. Keep in mind Wave has to actually negate the targeted monster in order for your monster to become unaffected. They have high recursion from the GY and a very good grind game. They are weak to backrow removal and (used to) lack almost any non-generic interaction besides the (used to be) unsearchable Wave. Anemone triggers if it leaves the field so always equip it with Battle Ocean. If your monster gets removed during your opponent's turn Anemone will trigger for extra recursion.</span>  <span>New Support</span>  <span>I'll quickly go over some of the new, relevant cards.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Marincess Sleepy Maiden"">Marincess Sleepy Maiden</a></span>: Specials Summons herself by protecting a Marincess card. Equips a Marincess Link monster from your GY to a Marincess Link monster you control. <strong>--&gt; Extender, niche protection and helps with OTK'ing.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Springirl"">Marincess Springirl</a></span><span>: Banishes a ""Marincess"" monster from GY; Special Summons itself. Mills cards equal to the number of ""Marincess"" monsters if it's linked off for a WATER Link monster and has a little burn effect. <strong>--&gt; Extender and may fill up GY with ressources.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Dive"">Marincess Dive</a></span><span>: Special Summons non-Link ""Marincess"" monster from GY or if you control Battle Ocean Special Summons one ""Marincess"" monster from deck. <strong>--&gt; Extender.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Coral Triangle"">Marincess Coral Triangle</a></span><span>: Link-3 that discards a WATER; searches a ""Marincess"" Trap Wave. Very strong extender past your first turn. <strong>--&gt; Archetypal Trap Searcher and Extender past first turn.</strong></span>  <span><a data-name=""Marincess Aqua Argonaut"">Marincess Aqua Argonaut</a></span><span>: Link-4 that targets a WATER you control and a card your opponent controls; returns them to hand (Ignition Effect).

Good if you have enough in hand already and don't need Tang's mill.</span>  <span>You have many extenders so there's a r4nk engine in here. With one more extender you may be able to use two level 4s to go into Bahamut Shark, summon Toadally Awesome and then use Shark as the extender for the Link-4 while also searching Wave.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Marincess Crystal Heart"">Marincess Crystal Heart</a></span> is not as important anymore but should not be disregarded since it makes your monster unaffected during your turn, too. <span><a data-name=""Marincess Marbled Rock"">Marincess Marbled Rock</a></span> gives extra recursion which is good to have past turn 1 to play through more interaction. <span><a data-name=""Marincess Wonder Heart"">Marincess Wonder Heart</a></span> is a terrible card turn 1 but enables an OTK without having to use Accesscode, which would disable a lot of effect that would otherwise lock you into WATER.</span>  <span>The Side deck is additional handtraps and Crossout targets. Since Battle Ocean is no longer a brick (you can then search Dive instead with Angel) I recommend playing 2. Before I played 1 Battle Ocean - 3 Dive but there's virtually no reason to play that over 2 -2 since opening one of them means searching the other. You could always play 2 Battle Ocean - 3 Dive.</span>  <span>There's plenty of Level 4 extenders. Tenyi Spirit -Shthana, Silent Angler and Abyss Shark (with 1 Silent Angler). Depending on how many you play making r4nks becomes even easier.</span>  <span>Changes to the decklist</span>  <span>Since I last uploaded this list I added a copy of Sleepy Maiden. Now I don't think she's mandatory to include in every decklist. Her biggest downside is her level but what she does she does pretty well. Ideally you end with Aqua Argonaut in your EMZ so once you're going for the OTK you would have to waste a lot of resources setting up a Marincess Wonder Heart in your EMZ to have her equipped with Mariness Link monsters. Milling Maiden off of Blue Tang allows your Wonder Heart in the MMZ to be equipped with a Marincess Link monster, making it easier to OTK through monsters. Her extension is also pretty great, considering the protection persists (or should, haven't checked out any rulings yet) even if she leaves the field. Since she can protect any Marincess <strong>card</strong> she can permanently protect your Field Spell from destruction, which is absolutely insane. Outing the Field Spell is how you out this deck, once the Field Spell gains protection you're in a fantastic spot. All you gotta do now is negate non-destructive effects that could out your Field Spell and you're good to go.</span>  <span>I also updated some handtraps but obviously handtraps will adapt to the meta so at the end of the day they can be whatever.</span>  <span>If you're not on Crossout you could get away with running less handtraps and either play more extenders or some backrow removal if you want. </span>"

This will let you search a Sky Striker Spell at the end of the turn.  Going Second - Open with Hayate and attack directly, then send whatever Sky Striker card you want to your GY (Recommend Widow Anchor, but situations vary). Then Link away into Kagari to retrieve the Sky Striker Spell you need from your GY. Finish with Linking into Shizuku for that extra Search.  Monster Destroyed - Get back Raye and Quick Effect her into Kaina to prevent you opponent's most dangerous Monster from attacking.  Finisher - When you have your opponent at 5300 LP or less, start the Talker Combo with Halqifibrax and Selene. You should have enough different Attribute Link Monsters in your GY to wipe your opponent's whole field of Monsters"

An archetype that does not use a Normal Summon, and is consisted of LIGHT Attributed monsters???","Hey wassup, it’s me, Grayewick the Fusion strategy enjoyer back with uh… another smokescreen strategy. I mean, it still features Invoked so it’s technically still half a Fusion strategy but anyway, presenting Invoked Galaxy-Eyes.  <strong> “So, why play this jank?”</strong>  <span>Galaxy-Eyes, apart from <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> and <a data-name=""Galaxy Wizard"">Galaxy Wizard</a>, does not play any relevant Normal Summon so, you know… I mean, at this point Konami should really consider giving every strategy a dedicated Normal Summon at this point else, people like me are just gonna keep splashing Invoked into it. I mean, that won't stop us but, you know what I mean.</span>  <strong>“What makes this playable or “good” enough?”</strong>  <span>Depending on how good your hand is, this deck can bring out any combinations of either <a data-name=""Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord"">Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</a>, <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>, and/or <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>, all before 5 summons, playing around <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>.</span>  <strong>“How do you win?”</strong>  <span>Controlling your opponent’s Monster and Spell effects, and Mechaba being technically an omni-negator. Also as per usual, we’re running traps which are three copies of <a data-name=""Tachyon Transmigration"">Tachyon Transmigration</a>. This card is funky and is one of the nuttiest Counter Trap cards I've read in my whole life and I love it. If your opponent becomes way too greedy at their chain links, just flip this up while you control any “Galaxy-Eyes” monster, and it negates all cards activated in that chain prior to it and shuffles them all away into the Deck, and this being a Counter Trap means that the only way your opponent could stop this is specifically with another Counter Trap, mainly <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>. Your main source of firepower will be from your Galaxy-Eyes monsters, being <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>. We’re not running <a data-name=""Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> in the deck because the space is too tight for one more room, but due to the prevalence of Zoodiacs, Lyrilusc, <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder</a>, and <a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a>, I’m heavily considering it. Overall, despite having control tools, this deck doesn’t have a problem OTK-ing and getting over big boss monsters with strong protection effects like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon because of <a data-name=""Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon"">Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon</a>.

It's almost like they didn't balance for a best of ones format in the least.,"This is an infinite negate tri-brigade lunalight build for master duel. If you don't know how this works, basically if you can summon the simorgh link and union carrier, you can equip simorgh with mist valley thunderbird and summon apex avian off of simorgh. avian is a non OPT omni negate that requires you to bounce a card and thunderbird summons itself when bound back to the hand (no hard OPT) so basically your opponent can't do anything. The board also ends on CDI for good measure as a backup in case your opponent has something to chain to the combo.  But most of you already knew all that, time for what I'm really here for... to complain about the banlist decisions that made this deck possible.  First off, why in the fresh hell in union carrier legal, this card is so unbelievably broken because not only is this bullshit legal, but so is the buster lock. WHO THE HELL THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA IN A FORMAT OF BEST OF ONES!  Secondly, the simorgh link was just recently banned in the TCG, this card is so broken be it fetching an omni negate or a barrier statue and this is without union carrier.  Thirdly is that Maxx ""c"" is legal in this format... I don't think this card is healthy for a best of one format, activating it wins you the game, and if your opponent doesn't have games 2 and 3 to try to make a comeback it is incredibly unfair.  last is that there are quite a few floodgates that should never be legal that are in this format, not playing them here because I respect my dignity and opponents, but again triple skill drain alongside emptiness being legal is yet again... not okay for a format of best of ones."

As a result, The herald variant is now unplayable due to consistency issues following the Eva ban. Most Drytron pro players will return to this Drytron strategy that I will be showing you today.  Big thank to Youtuber Tatsym for uploading the decklist in March 2021 as it inspired me a lot to build this deck and play it competitively.  Strengths: <ul>  	<li>Nibiru-proof by means of Vendread Battlelord, a card that allows you to prohibit a card type( monster, spell or trap from activating)Be mindful that this card should. be prioritized to summon before the 5th summon by using the Vendread ritual spell Revendread Evolution.</li>  	<li>Great consistency, due to multiple search cards and much more drytron than other variants, this deck is pretty consistent</li>  	<li>Huge endboard: The endboard is really absurd if you can full combo. For example, with drytron Nova+any card that leads to Battlelord is Phul( quick ritual. summon to go into Bethor for a pop 4 or 5 potentially), I:P for apollousa or Underworld Goddess according to your matchup, Abyss Dweller and Lancea with followup from typically 3 to 4 drytrons in your GY.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Weakness:</li>  	<li>Lose to Droll: Not too different from the Herald variant, thís deck loses to Droll really hard. However, I chose to play 3 Gamma for this issue and as people don't usually main deck droll anymore for the fallen of the old Drytron and Bird-ups. If they side Droll against you, you can have crossout designator instead of the appointer of the Red Lotus in the side deck to cover more handtraps and shut down going second cards such as Droplet and Dark ruler no more.</li>  	<li>Hard time going second: If you don't open with great going second cards, you better be ready to go for Zeus. One typical play that i usually use is to Xyz summon Mu-beta Fafnir with no eff and then Downerd straight to Zeus.                                                                                                                                                                                          Combos There are many hands that you can combo with but the main goal is to get Battlelord out ASAP and get to curious. I would say 90% of the hands that lead to Curious can help you full combo.</li> </ul>"

Basically you Normal Summon a Tuner that can revive itself (<span>Jet Synchron</span>, <span>Glow-up Bulb</span>, <span>Plaguespreader Zombie</span>, etc), or a monster that can Special Summon a Tuner from the Deck, and you end with 3 counters <span>Borreload Savage Dragon</span>  + <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span> without a single Extender (if not interrupted)  The Combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span></li>  	<li>Link into <span>Almiraj</span> -&gt; <span>Revive Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span></li>  	<li>Link into <span>Crystron Halqifibrax</span> -&gt; Summon <span>Deskbot 001</span></li>  	<li>Link into <span>Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</span> -&gt; Summon 3 Lvl 3 Tokens -&gt; Trigger <span>Deskbot 001</span> to revive from GY</li>  	<li>Synchro 1 Token + <span>Deskbot 001</span> into <span>Herald of the Arc Light</span></li>  	<li><span>Auroradon</span> Tribute itself and 1 Token to Summon <span>Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</span> from the Deck</li>  	<li>Synchro <span>O-Lion</span> + 1 Token into a <span>Lvl 5 Synchro Tuner</span> -&gt; <span>Trigger O-Lion</span> to Summon a Lvl 3 Token</li>  	<li>Synchro those 2 into <span>Borreload Savage Dragon</span> -&gt; Equip <span>Auroradon</span></li>  	<li>Enjoy your free 2 Omni-Negates</li> </ol> <strong><span>Extra Combos</span></strong>  Just by putting a single Synchro and a single Garnet in your Deck, you can get an extra Omni-Negate Counter Trap with the exact same resources. What is that Synchro? <span>Denglong, the First of the Yang Zing</span>, a currently banned card in the TCG  The Extra Combo is as follows: <ol>  	<li>Same Combo as 1-5, <span>the lvl 5 Synchro Tuner</span> is <span>Denglong</span> -&gt; <span>Denglong</span> add <span>Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing</span></li>  	<li>Synchro into <span>Borreload Savage Dragon</span> -&gt; Equip <span>Auroradon</span> -&gt; <span>Denglong</span> Trigger to Summon a Yang Zing (preferably <span>Chi Wen</span>) from the Deck</li>  	<li>Enjoy your <strong>FREE</strong> Omni-Negate that can negate <span>Dark Ruler</span>, and potentially <span>Droplet</span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Extenders</strong></span>  Does the Combo ends there? NOPE, that's just 1 card combo. What if you have an extra Extender in your hand? The best Extender I could think of is <span>Quick-Lauch</span>. Why <span>Quick Launch</span>? Because <span>Quick Launch</span> can Special Summon <span>Rokket Tracer</span>, and guess what Tracer can do? Pop a Yang Zing to Summon a Lvl 4 Rokket from the Deck. In this case, the Yang Zing doesn't miss timing because <span>Tracer</span> says <strong>and if you do</strong>. This will allow you to make another <span>Lvl 8 Synchro</span> without losing advantage. But keep in mind that <span>Tracer</span> locks you into DARK Extra Deck monsters only, which mean you can't make <span>Dragite</span> from this. If you want to make <span>Dragite</span>, you have to make it early in place of <span>Borreload</span>. Then you can make <span>Borreload</span> later with Tracer  The other good Extender is <span>Nemesis Corridor</span>. Since <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span> is inevitably going to get banished by its own effect. <span>Corridor</span> is pretty much a free <span>Thunder Dragon Colossus</span>  The last Extenders are <span>Destrudo</span> and <span>Instant Fusion</span>. These 2 doesn't extend the Combo itself (Same Combo as having no Extender), instead they support the Combo consistency. If your <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span> Searcher got negated, just use <span>Destrudo</span>/<span>Instant Fusion</span> and you will still Full Combo (if they have no more interruptions)  <span><strong>Things You Should Know</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>You can Summon <span>Jet Synchron</span>/<span>Plaguespreader</span> off <span>Halqifibrax</span> to go into <span>Unicorn</span> into <span>Accesscode</span> instead (Going second)</li>  	<li>Most of the Link Monsters are used for Turn 2 or higher</li>  	<li><span>FA Dawn Dragster</span> and <span>Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</span> can easily be Summoned from <span>Destrudo</span></li>  	<li>You can make 3 Materials <span>Apollousa</span> with 2 Extenders if your <span>Halqifibrax</span> got Negated</li>  	<li>If your <span>Halqifibrax</span> got Negated, you can still end with <span>Borreload</span> via Quick Launch (<span>Tracer</span> pop <span>Halqifibrax</span> -&gt; Synchro into <span>Borreload</span>)</li>  	<li>If you open up <span>Destrudo</span>, Prioritize Normal Summoning your Searcher over the Tuners themself to bait out handtraps</li>  	<li>If <span>Halqifibrax</span> got negated, you can banish it during your opponent's turn to go into <span>Denglong</span> to <em>maybe</em> survive the turn, then you can shuffle back <span>Halqifibrax</span> with Corridor</li>  	<li><span>Pot of Avarice</span> is used to reset your Extra Deck and Combo Pieces so that you can do the <span>Halqifibrax</span> Combo again next turn</li>  	<li><span>Yazi</span> can pop 1 card and itself, which then float into <span>Mare Mare</span>; generating 3 free tokens that can be used for Link plays (<span>Phoenix</span> -&gt; <span>Unicorn</span> -&gt; <span>Halqifibrax</span>/<span>Accesscode</span>)</li> </ul> <span><strong>Summary</strong></span>  Is the Deck good? The main problem with the Deck is the little amount of Extender it has, which mean it usually lose to handtraps. A single <span>Ash Blossom</span> can cost you the game. However, if you successfully do the Combo, you pretty much win the game (most of the time). Without Side Deck, you don't have to worry about things like <span>Kaiju</span> or <span>Sphere Mode</span> as much. This board can easily be broken by a single <span>Droplet</span> (sending monsters and Traps), but you still have <span>Nine</span> <span>Pillars</span>  The other Weakness that the Deck has is Garnets. If you draw <span>Tracer</span>, your <span>Quick Launch</span> is less effective. If you draw <span>O-Lion</span>, can't make <span>Borreload</span>. This issue could be solved by <span>Plaguespreader</span> returning a card back into the Deck  How about consistency? I decided to play a 48 cards Deck because I need some board breaker going 2nd. You may think that it's not consistent because of it, but remember that you have 20 Starters (6 is <span>Destrudo</span>, 1 is <span>Instant Fusion</span>) that leads you into the Combo. That literally means you have more than 90% chance to open at least 1 Starter (80% if you don't count <span>Destrudo</span> and <span>Instant Fusion</span>). So I would say it's pretty consistent (I tried using 5 sample draws and I got at least 1 Starter 10x in a row). Also more Cards mean less chance to draw Garnets  Is the Deck Expensive? Well... It's very Expensive actually. 9N, 7R, 24 SR, 23 UR (Remember that one of the SR is easily replaceable, check Note). But don't worry, the Staples are replaceable, Extra Deck cards that aren't mentioned in the Combo are replaceable... Good Luck getting those SR/UR CPs!!!  <span><strong>Update</strong></span>  <span>Added Cards: <span>1x Mare Mare</span>, <span>3x Forbidden Droplets</span>, <span>3x Dragon Shrine</span></span>  Replaced Cards: <span>2x Ash Blossoms</span> -&gt; <span>3x Infinite Impermanence</span> (Trading <span>Maxx ""C""</span> counter for better board breaker + better synergy with <span>Droplet</span>)  Updated text about consistency and added list on ""Things You Should Know"""

Yes, I blind second. Yes, this isn't a cheap deck to build. Yes, I do not play <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> because everyone's playing <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. Yes, I literally do not care about getting <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>-ed because your opponent won't have another turn to play as soon as either Avramax or Final Sigma hits the board. As per usual, cards on the main are the cards that I would personally play and the tech options will be placed in the side.  <strong>""So, how does this deck exactly work?""</strong>  In summation: One Punch.  <span>First of all, let me address this one thing: If not for literally <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> and even with <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> honestly, this deck would be slow as fuck. I'd be running <a data-name=""Double Summon"">Double Summon</a>s like I'm playing a slower version of Powerload Ogre turbo and yes, it does brick, that's why we blind second to get that extra card, and you'll never know if your opponent is playing a blind second strategy as well, and if they do, they probably run Kaijus, which kills all your boss monsters. So deck strategy, it's pretty straightforward. Make either <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, or the archetypal boss monster <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> and one shot your opponent with big number. That's why we also run <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, because we want to end games as soon as possible, and it would be stupid for your opponent to leave a back row without a monster on the field, unless it's an Eldlich player that hard drew <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>.</span>  So yeah, if you want to be extra annoying, use <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> as well after summoning <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> and trigger your opponent's PTSD from <a data-name=""Apoqliphort Towers"">Apoqliphort Towers</a> turbo because fuck it, it's basically the same thing, except Towers messes up with your opponent's resources and makes them feel violated while Final Sigma messes up with your opponent's LP and pride after getting one shot by a deck that's not even rogue. Have fun in the ladder."

Lesgo? ","Now Drytron don't have a way to make ""unbreakable"" boards ;-;  So since we can't win in one combo now, i made this deck aimed for a better grind game and this board: <a data-name=""Drytron Meteonis Draconids"">Drytron Meteonis Draconids</a> - <a data-name=""Red-eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-eyes Dark Dragoon</a> - <a data-name=""Masquerena"">Masquerena</a> - <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda."">Predaplant Verte Anaconda.</a>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Explaining the engines:</li> </ul> <ol>  	<li>From my short experience using this megalith engine (1x<a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, 1x<a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> and a second <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron</a>) i don't like it, but it's not like it is bad. Is Difficult to explain how im feeling. Anyway it adds another tool for the deck and can be replaced if you found something better.</li>  	<li>The Cyber Angel engine is strong as always and can be used to search <a data-name=""Vanity's Ruler"">Vanity's Ruler</a> that is a insta win against many decks and helps playing against nibiru.</li>  	<li>Dragoon: Dragoon: Sussy.</li> </ol> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Some ideas:</li> </ul> At OCG there's some drytron decks using this Scythe-lock strategy with <a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a>: you search <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> either with <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> or Dagda then link summon Halqifibrax, at the opponent turn you summon T <a data-name="".G. &lt;a data-name=&quot;. Wonder Magician&quot;&gt;Wonder Magician&lt;/a&gt;"">.G. </a><a data-name="". Wonder Magician"">Wonder Magician</a> with Halqifibrax effect and destroy Scythe, Scythe will trigger, special summoning itself while locking your opponent extra deck and then you activate Wonder Magician Quick effect and synchro summon <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>. Its a good combo but since i am already using Vanity's Ruler i think it isn't necessary in this deck.  Other thing that i want to note is that <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> will destroy Drytron like a Meteor now that is difficult to make a early negate or use Herald of Orange Light (tbh you can use Orange Light but it isn't good without eva, maybe 1 copie at maximum since you can search it). Droll is also problematic for the same reason. I might start using 2-3 Crossout Designator and one Orange Light for that reason.  &nbsp;  I hope you have a good day my fellow Drytron enjoyner.  And please correct me if did said something wrong, im still learning after all.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  GLHF"

This is basically just Final Sigma turbo.  The slots for <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> can pretty much be any staple cards you want, but if you do have <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> or <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>, use them for consistency. I only use <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> instead of <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> because this is a F2P build and I can use it in either Battle or Damage Step to pitch my Mathmechs from my hand to the GY and it's the easiest UR to farm. Your usual combo line would be:  • <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, or <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a>, pitching Multiplication to add Diameter • Normal Summon Diameter to Special Summon said Multiplication • Either Special Summon Addition or Subtraction from the hand • Make Final Sigma and trigger Multiplication in the graveyard, targeting Final Sigma, then attack.  Just make sure not to summon Final Sigma while Skill Drain was up, instead activate Skill Drain when Final Sigma is already face-up on the field. So yeah, actual short guide this time. This is not a competitive form by any means, instead just a cheap yet playable version of it."

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.  ""Drytron"" (ドライトロン Doraitoron) is an archetype of LIGHT Machine Special Summon Monsters which debuted in Deck Build Pack: Genesis Impactors. The Main Deck monster's names are based on stars in the constellation of Draco. In addition to that, they feature their corresponding star and the part of the constellation in which it is located in their artwork's background. The full constellation can be seen in ""Meteonis Drytron"". Most of the Spell/Trap card names are based on stellar phenomenon.  ""Invoked"", known as ""Invoked Beast"" (召しょう喚かん獣じゅう Shōkanjū) (aside from ""Augoeides"" and ""Elysium"") represents a different Attribute, with their Fusion Materials being ""Aleister the Invoker"" plus one monster of their specific Attribute, and are named after historical or mythological elements related to said Attribute. They also contain the staff of ""Aleister"" somewhere in their artworks, but much brighter than the original.  Link to use this deck :  https://youtube.com/watch?v=lu6vuYvEKJk"

You can pot 8000+ of damage on your first turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>This toolbox is trying to abuse the Invoked engine, it’s lack of restrictions and the free body aleister leaves in the field with some strong little engines and strategies to create a very varied toolbox with great success. However, this toolbox is, at times, inconsistent, there is enough one card combos, hand traps, super poly targets and troublesome cards your opponent will have to get rid of, and a lot of the times that task is out of his reach.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The latest release of Small World made this deck incredibly consistent. Small world functions like this:</span>  <span>There are 3 monsters involved. Monsters A, B and C.</span>  <span>You banish monster A from your hand, then from your deck you banish Monster B, then you take Monster C to your hand.</span>  <span>And Monster A must have one common characteristic with Monster B, and B with C.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Small World uses the Hand traps in your hand and turns them into Aleisters.</span>  <span>Here’s what’s the characteristic they share with him:</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ash Blossom (And any sister except Ghost reaper) <strong>DEF1800</strong></span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Effect Veiler and Droll &amp; Lock Bird </span> <strong>SPELLCASTER</strong></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong>THIS DECK IS GOING 2ND</strong>. As many cards go to full power when your opponent has a built board for the Mekk Knights to be special summoned and build board presence and card advantage, making them Link-2 material for the subsequent fusions, or making a rank 8 to get rid of a problematic card.</span>  <span>The </span><b>Shaddoll </b><span>engine works the best with your opponent having an extra deck monster on board, making the Shaddoll Construct, giving you a +1 from Beast or Spell/trap removal from Dragon. Making Construct can Mill the other Shaddoll used for it’s fusion, making both available. Also making Winda can be useful to send both monsters to the GY triggering them and giving you an incredible floodgate.</span>  <b>Super Polymerization</b><span> is another Going 2nd card wipe, giving you either an Invoked after normal summoning the aleister or a Starving Vemon basically for free using monsters from your opponent, taking care of the threats before you start going wild.</span>  <span>You can also play Dark Ruler No More for easy board building, but this deck tries to go for the kill ASAP.</span>  <b>Cosmic Cyclone</b><span> is preferred over Twisters, since a lot of cards like Zombie World can be retrieved, but once they are banished they’re gone.</span>  <b>Salamangreat Almiraj</b><span> is to make a free Purgatrio, a free body and gives you some options.</span>  <b>Borreload Dragon</b><span> is the answer to the excess of bodies you sometimes generate, he can get rid of annoying threats. Can steal a monster, non target, can reduce ATK and no one can stop it, can OTk and cannot be targeted.</span>  <b>Number 23: Lancelot</b><span>. Almost never came up, since Dingirsu if more useful most of the time, but can be useful to annoy your opponent.</span>  <b>Dingirsu </b><span>is excellent, gets rid of almost anything and can be made after attacking with both LV8 mekk knights to protect your stuff.</span>  <b>Masked HERO Dark Law</b><span> is a niche but VERY bad ass monster that abuses Aleister’s DARK attribute, sending him to the GY before Invokating the party.</span>  <b>Ultra Polymerization</b><span> is very useful to create a free body. By paying 2000 LP you’ll summon a Mekk Knight, an Aleister to make Mechaba, then summon them back to create the Link 2 and use Invocation to start the combo. In all, it gives you a </span><b>free Mechaba</b><span>.</span>  <b>Aleister The Invoker Of Madness</b><span> is a great extender, it gives you Invocations from your deck or Book Of The Law (not once per turn) AND triggers Shaddolls.</span>  <b>Book Of The Law</b><span> is very fun to use, but when you open it, it hurts so bad. Nothing like Mask Changing your fusions, most of the times into the big bad rock</span>  <b>Neos Fusion</b><span> is a very powerful card to end your board, is a free Rainbow Neos to eliminate your opponent’s GY, Spell/Trap Zone or Monster Zone in one shot, as it is also a 4500 ATK beast that can get almost anything you’ll encounter done.</span>  <b>Destrudo </b><span>is the newest addition to the mix, as he is also one of the strongest cards ever. To get rid of Aleister you have multiple options and he might be one of the coolest and more exploitable of them all. Getting for free an Arcanite Magician to destroy up to 2 cards your opponent controls or giving yourself a free car that negates spell/trap card or effect per turn, or a Cyberse Quantum Dragon to bounce some problematic card up.</span>  <b>All the hand traps</b><span> in this deck can stop your opponent’s growth on his turn, stopping him if possible in a Link 1 or 2 for you to use his column, Shaddoll Fusion or Super Poly, etc. All of these hand traps can search for Aleister the Invoker with Small World, making them useful even after turn 1.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>… All of that without having even started with the Invoked monsters.</span>  <b>Mechaba </b><span>is the main beast, the easier to summon since Effect Veiler, Neos, Rainbow Dragon and all the Mekk Knights are LIGHT attribute. Once he comes you can protect yourself (except from traps) from almost anything with a 2500 ATK he will go for the game.</span>  <b>Augoeides </b><span>is an incredible Control/OTK monster, being able to fuse it using more commonly than not, a Raidjin from the GY you bringed up with Instant Fusion, and can pop stuff passively and when it’s summoned. Neat.</span>  <b>Raidjin </b><span>is free using the soup. It’s capable of coming with the Drolls and quick effect to get rid of something, can be used to bring the Link-2, to attack, to stall, it’s very versatile.</span>  <b>Invoked Purgatrio</b><span> it’s an underrated train. Against the right deck can OTK himself using aleisters to boost him up even more and do crazy damage. Wiping your entire opponent’s board with him it’s a thing of beauty.</span>  <b>Invoked Magellanica</b><span> is an Earth 3K beater that can be useful at times. It's EARTH attribute which can be found in a lot of decks to get rid of your opponent GY. It’s 3K, sometimes using aleister to boost him up a little it’s all you need.</span>  <b>Elysium </b><span>is the most underrated. His potential is very threatening and your opponent WILL respect it. First of all, it’s a Super poly target using a monster from your opponent’s Extra Deck, it’s 4K Defense, 3200 ATK. It’s a Wall. His quick effect is a nuke that could banish all monsters on your opponent board by banishing itself, as he is considered as LIGHT, DARK, EARTH, WATER, FIRE AND WIND. Or you can use your GY to shoot that cannon using dead invoked monsters from that attribute. If it comes, it will make your opponent very uncomfortable.</span>  <span><strong>Invoked Caliga</strong> is a good floodgate, but most of the time you’ll not need it.</span>  <span><strong>Invoked Cocytus</strong> is a WATER attribute, that’s it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>There are a lot of cool things you can do with it:</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Control</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>OTK</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Long games</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Gimmicks</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Board wipes</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Multiple negations</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Non-target, non-destruction removal</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Multiple hand traps</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Synchro plays</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Destructions effects</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Board protection</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Bricks provide material for Invocation</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>WEAKNESSES:</span>  <span>One of the main weaknesses of this deck are the floodgates, especially spells and traps since this deck has no consistent ways to deal with them. Mystic Mine, Skill Drain, unless you hard draw the Cosmic Cyclone you're a dead man.</span>  <span>Other than that, this deck is calle Toolbox because that’s basically it, a toolbox to deal with most meta threats, break boards and go for game in a turn. It’s incredibly explosive and can be further expanded, since Aleister the Invoker will once again, find new ways to abuse more and more cards to come.</span>"

Destroy cards, get out every zoodiac on top of each other, special summon from the gy, manipulate xyz materials, and use Zeus if needed.  Tenki being unlimited and Drident being limited to 1 makes this deck kind of insane. Not to mention the stupid amounts of card draw with Maxx-c and pot of desires and pot of avarice.  Their field spell is underrated to an unfair amount. It grants them protection, destruction, and an attack/defense boost that actually makes a difference a lot of the time.  Pot of Avarice is super useful to get Drident back into the deck. It is also active a lot of the time due to the number of monsters being sent to the gy by the XYZ monsters. The same thing applies to Zoodiac Combo but it is a trap and only draws 1 but has an additional effect so you only run 1 Zoodiac Combo and 2 copies of Pot of Avarice.  you of course have the staple hand traps and destruction which is useful in every game and is just necessary for obvious reasons. you have Red Reboot to stop the solemn cards and some other disruption that can screw with this deck.  You can replace the 2 Called by the Grave for 2 twin twisters, mst, or cosmic cyclone but I wouldn't recommend it since they are useful for stoping handtraps."

Powerful pure deck build synergy featuring Eda the Sun Magician and versatile extra deck tool,"This deck was built to take full advantage of the whole Charmer / Familiar-Possessed archetype including spells and traps introduced in the Structure Deck: Spirit Charmers. After playing with different deck builds for several months it's become clear that the field spell Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin plays a HUGE role to being able to stun and slightly slow down opponents just enough for Charmers/Familiar Possessed to slightly build a board. This Deck is not at all meta nor the next tier 1 YET it becomes really fun after a learning curve. Spells and Traps are the backbone of this deck and Awakening of the Possessed forms are kept in the deck to help search ""Possessed"" Spell/Traps on top of being able to be special summoned from the Deck with their unique effects.  &nbsp;  The purpose of the deck is to be a stun/control deck revolving around Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin and Eda the Sun Magician. Having Grand Spiritual Art -Ichirin up on the field is VERY important to begin stunning and board building because [1] Grand Spiritual Art -Ichirin negates your opponent's first monster effect as long as a Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF is up on the field and [2] Grand Spiritual Art -Ichirin allows you to push back any Charmer / Familiar-Possessed from hand into the deck to help search for a smaller form of the Awakening of the Possessed monsters (This is a HUGE deal because if you control a Spellcaster monster you can special summon any of the smaller forms from the hand). Eda the Sun Magician's role in this build is VERY important because not only does Eda the Sun Magician fulfill Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin's requirement to be able to negates your opponent's first monster effect, when normal summoned or flipped-up, Eda the Sun Magician grants a special summon of 1 Spellcaster from hand or Deck in face-down defense position AND Eda the Sun Magician's quick effect allows for a disruption of opponents board building by being able change 1 face-down Spellcaster from defense to face-up Attack OR Defense Position. This essentially puts 2 negates up on the board if the proper Charmer is flipped face-up to steal an opponent's monster.  &nbsp;  Spirit Charmers is the important to be able to search any of the ""Charmer"" monsters. ""Familiar-Possessed"" monsters, and/or ""Possessed"" Spells/Traps including Unpossessed. 3 copies of this card is without a doubt necessary for any Charmer/Familiar-Possessed pure deck build. Ideally, Spirit Charmers should be used to help set up backrow to synergy the whole board. A synergized Charmer/Familiar-Possessed board of this pure build should have Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin, Awakening of the Possessed, and Unpossessed all active at once with at least 1 Charmer monster face up in defense position.  &nbsp;  Awakening of the Possessed is the main draw engine and helps beef up all monsters you control by 300 ATK for each different attribute you control. This help clear the board with Familiar-Possessed monsters often times having enough ATK to get through most monsters AND Awakening of the Possessed also helps protect Charmers / Familiar-Possessed monsters from being destroyed by card effects.  &nbsp;  Unpossessed is the main protection for Charmers. When Unpossessed is up Charmer monsters you control can not be destroyed by battle. Not only that but Unpossessed helps boost Familiar-Possessed monsters by giving them an additional 800 ATK when attacking an opponent's monster. On top of all of that whenever a monster you control is destroyed by battle or card effect; Unpossessed lets you special summon a 1 Spellcaster with 1500 DEF from your deck in Attack Position or face-down Defense position.  &nbsp;  Possessed Partnerships for this build is a 3 and here is why. Possessed Partnerships allows you to special summon 1 Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF from your hand or GY in attack position or face-down position, then, if you control monsters with 2 or more different attributes you can destroy 1 face-up card on the field. Depending on how the board looks often times this card is used to destroy 1 face-up card on the field primarily backrow or field spell YET the purpose of this card as well is to help keep a Spellcaster with 1500 DEF up on the field to reap full effects of Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin. BUT the main purpose of having Unpossessed at 3 is due to its graveyard effect allowing it to be banished to target a ""Possessed""/""Unpossessed"" continuous Spell/Trap in your GY to then place it face-up on your field. Essentially having Possessed Partnerships in the graveyard helps set up your board  &nbsp;  Magician's Right Hand is here to make opponent spend resources. (This card usually helps force opponent to deal with it)  This card can easily be swapped out depending on opponent's deck build. Solemn Judgment and Magician's Left Hand serve a similar purpose and are usually swapped in when facing Eldlich decks.  &nbsp;  Pinpoint Guard is just there to help bring back a Charmer / Familiar-Possessed. Primarily Charmers to help re-establish board lock on next turn. Fairy Tail - Luna can be swapped in to help bounce opponent's monsters on the field and help synergize with Awakening of the Possessed draw engine. Fairy Tail - Luna also synergizes with Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin's deck searching effect.  &nbsp;  Night's End Sorcerer is new to the build. Night's End Sorcerer was added to gain access to Synchro toolbox of Levels 5, 6, and 7 due to main deck staples running 4 level 3, 4 level 4, and 4 level 5 monsters, not counting Eda the Sun Magician. Nights End Sorcerer is very neat to the build and can really help stun if used to bring out Clear Wing Synchro Dragon (Pretty much a mini Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon).  &nbsp;  Hope you enjoy!!"

I again found some cards that would make it better, and here it is! The deck contains:  Main:  3 Luster Dragon- Here only as a material for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon""  3 Nexus- Banish 4 opponent's monsters from GY to be special summoned, destroys all ATK position extra deck monsters, AND inflicts 800 damage for each destroyed. Ideal if your opponent plays Invoked.  3 Fleurdelis- Very easy to special summon, negates effects of an extra deck monster and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.  3 Ashyan- Easy to summon, adds a monster from the GY to the hand, and makes all Dogmatikas gain 500 ATK.  3 Theo- Easy to summon, cannot be destroyed by battle and transfers 600 ATK from an opponent's monster to itself.  3 Ecclesia- Literally does 70% of support to a whole deck.  3 Adin- Easy to summon, special summons a Dogmatika monster from the deck.  3 Shaddoll Beast- Requires 1 tribute to be set, +1 if flips, and +1 more if destroyed by effect.  3 White Knight- You cannot summon extra deck monsters, but you can destroy an extra deck monster directly from each extra deck.  1 Cyber-Stein- Limited, so only one we get.  3 Dogmatikalamity- Used just to summon White Knight.  1 Nation- Only one because you can add it with ""Terraforming"". All dogmatikas are immune to the extra deck monsters' effects and destroy a battling monster instead of  themself.  1 Terraforming- Limited, so only one we can have.  1 Monster Reborn- Limited, so only one we can have.  3 Encounter- Not the best, but useful.  3 Infinite Impermanence- A cheap version of ""Ash Blossom"".  3 Genesis- Returns your banished Extra deck monster and negates opponent's.  3 Mirror force- if you go first and get this card, just set it and end turn. Then, your opponent will regret when he attacks you.  Extra:  1 Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon- Super broken and surely the best ever fusion monster.  1 Number 39: Utopia- Not really the best, but very easy to summon.  1 Divine Arsenal AA ZEUS- Sky Thunder- Easy to summon, has at least 2 Xyz materials when summoned, and does a ""Black Hole"" effect, saves itself  from it, and all of that with a price of just 2 Xyz materials.  1 Decode Talker- Super generic and very easy to summon, it is one of the cards that can level up every weak deck.  1 Decode Talker Extended- The same as the normal ""Decode Talker"", but stronger.  1 Accesscode Talker- Very generic, and also very strong. The upgraded version of previous two Talkers.  1 Predaplant Verte Anaconda- A very good fusion support for ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"".  Side:  3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- one of the best hand traps ever, screws pretty much everything.  3 Effect Veiler- Simply negates the effects of one monster.  3 Ghost Ogre- Say goodbye to that monster."

Summon either Sangan or Witch Of The Black Forest, use Dark Hole then search for one of the pieces.  Activate Allure Of Darkness at all costs, then banish either Sangan or Witch (you need Battle Fader for stalling).  Use Magical Mallet to get rid of cards you find unnecessary at any specific time during the duel.  Gold Sarcophagus can be used to either slim down the deck so you draw the pieces faster (in this case you banish any other monster that's not an Exodia piece) OR you can banish a piece of Exodia, use Burial From A Different Dimension to send it to your GY (another piece must be face up on the field at this given time), then use Dark Hole or Torrential Tribute to send the face up Exodia piece to the GY. Once this step is complete, you can activate Dark Factory Of Mass Production and retrieve both pieces. ONLY go for second route if you wanna retrieve the piece banished by the Sarcophagus the SAME turn it is banished. I'd do this if only one piece is remaining."

YES! but its fun it can play againtst backrow, and the combo with punks is enabled with:  Ze amin, search Fox lady, foxy tune discard + other send to grave; summon Sharakusai, if you have P U N K in hand fusion in a way you only leave Sharakusai on field (you need him to later synchro 11 on oponents turn with a level 8 myutant). Fusion tributes itsef and you summon form deck Madame spider + (insert any punk lvl3 ot Sharakusai if you used him). Search trap with Madem spider.  Halquifibrax for deskbot, Link 3 Aurorodon and later, 3 tokens, deskbot revives, go into cupid pitch, lower level to form 4 to 3, coral dragon, tribute coral + token with link 3 effect to summon Coltwing, your field should be 4 cards in hand, 2 tokens, Sharakusai, level 10 coltwing + Deskbot 01. (CUPID SEARCH PSYCHIC TRACKER)  with the deskbot you can go into a FA. Dawn dragster, or go for a shooting riser dragon (7*) with the 2 tokens (3+3+1). with shooting star send from deck to grave a level 1 and go to baroness. (for now this part sending a level 1 with nothing to use for it i still dont know what so i would love some help)  if this play started by special summoning Ze Amin with foxy first turn, or teleport, go on to your myutant plays, if you had to normal summon it, hopefully you drew the myutant field spell + a myutant. for now its been very consistent for me to put a the fullboard including a level 8 myutant + fleur + Sharakusai + link 3 and 1-2 facedowns, if you started with normal summon Ze amin but havent used your teleport, use teleport for myutatn combo.  MYUTANT COMBO IS ALWAYS LAST.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I reached plat 1 with it. I'll go over the basic combo + end board. The basic endboard is basically, a 4k Arrival Cyberse + an unaffected Cyberse Quantum Dragon. How to get there through a 1 card combo: Normal summon Achichi --&gt; add Pikari Link achichi for Infant --&gt; Infant adds AI Land Activate AI Land --&gt; summon pikari through AI land Pikari adds AI meet you --&gt; activate ai meet you AI meet you adds Doyon --&gt; Link Pikari and Infant for Cyberse Wicckid Activate AI Land to summon Doyon to a zone Wicckid points to --&gt; CL1 Doyon, CL2 Wicckid. Doyon adds back the monster you've normal summoned, which in our case is Achichi. Wicckid banishes Infant and adds us Bururu. --&gt; Link of Doyon + Wicckid for Transcode Talker --&gt; activate AI land and summon Bururu, you must avoid the zone Transcode Talker points to, since we're using Transcode Talker's effect --&gt; Bururu sends Gatchiri to the GY --&gt; Transcode Talker activates its effect to summon back Wicckid --&gt; Link the 3 units away for Dark Templar --&gt; Activate AI land yet again to summon Achichi --&gt;link away Achichi for Infant, Infant must be summoned to the left most zone of Templar --&gt; activate Templar's effect, CL1 Templar, CL2 Infant --&gt; Change Infant's attribute to Divine and summon three units through Templar's effect --&gt; The three units you will be summoning are: Achichi, Bururu, Pikari, --&gt; Synchro summon, Pikari + Bururu for Cyberse Quantum Dragon --&gt; Activate Bururu's effect to summon back Pikari --&gt; Link Achichi + Pikari for Splash Mage --&gt; Activate Splash mage's effect to summon Gatchiri --&gt; Make Arrival Cyberse with every unit except for Cyberse Quantum Dragon --&gt; Activate Gatchiri effect targetting Cyberse Quantum Dragon to make him unaffected by your opponent's card effects till the end of their turn So, now we have 2 unaffected units, one of them protecting the other. If your opponent attacks Cyberse Quantum Dragon (which they must in order to out Arrival Cyberse) you can activate it's effect to bounce back that monster. This is basically not outable in Master Duel, since the only popular counter are Kaiju's and nobody runs Kaiju's in a 1 game format. I run 1 Crossout Designator as well as 2 Called by the Graves to out possible hadntraps. The limitation on Crossout in Master Duel is super annoying. I've considered running Sauravis as a replacement for atleast Veiler/Imperm, but I do not think it's worth it. </p><p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong> Pros deck: -Very easy to OTK -Good end board -Unexpected, not many people know what @Ignisters do. I had tons of people try and out the unaffected Cyberse Quantum Dragon through stuff like Raigeki, which obviously does not work, but since people don't know what @ignisters do and don't read cards, it's basically a free win. -Genuinely fun to play Cons: -Susceptible to handtraps especially Nibiru, that's why the Crossout's + Called by's are so important. &nbsp;</p>"

This deck was built during the","!WARNING! This deck runs 3 Pot of Desires but because Master Duel runs on this weird banlist I had to replace it with another pot of card. So if you're making it in Master Duel, 3 pot, if you're doing this in Omega or the real OCG, you might have to run another draw card. !WARNING!  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The FTK aspect of this deck can be simplified to this.  You need either 2 dark room of nightmare or dark room and 1 light stage mixed with a continue, in the case of 2 desires that would be a live stage, in the case of light stage, festival and magical lauriel would be the most optimal thing to add to hand, but this option is a bit rough as you have to focus even more on placement of tokens as to optimally squeeze all the effect damage out of holly angel.  Ok, if you have either of these set ups the combo is simple <ol>  	<li>Try to bait out Ash with canadina or one of your other special summons. If you can do this, you can set up the rest of your plays without the fear of interruption in 90% of cases. (If you often get screwed by nibiru you can switch out droll and called by for nibiru and crossout designator.)</li>  	<li>If you make it out alive, you can use your whatever extender you have, whether its Festival, or live stage, or another trick star to start setting up for the combo. Go into Bloom (Link 1) and then into Holly Angel if you know you will be safe. This way if you pull Magical Lauriel you will have a target that can assist you into another link monster.</li>  	<li>Heres where the magic happens. Link summon into everything you possibly can. But if you have a dead trickstar in your hand and feel like gambling, link into crimson heart and see what the luck of the draw gives you. You could get a good card like an extender, or you can get a dead card, like a nibiru or droll and lock.</li>  	<li>When you come to the point where you can make the link 4 you have 1 job. place Bella Madonna ANYWHERE that doesn't point to a monster. By this point Bella will do 1000-1600 damage on her own, which will probably be the FTK, and if not, they'll be really close.</li> </ol> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now know this deck can work through Ash blossom and does not only work as an FTK deck, Festival can protect Trickstars from destruction, Holly Angel gains attack everytime burn damage is inflicted, and you have some good turn 1 effects like Divaridis who if you go up against a heavy special summon deck its like playing with Maxx C but instead of maximum draw power, it's how much health will your enemy have at the end of your combo while Holly Angel is getting 200 attack every summon. So this is a decent Rogue deck with a really fun FTK to try out when the stars align."

Zombie World is a powerful field that changes every monster(s) on the field and the GY into zombies. Some decks face huge problems with this (eg. Tri-brigade).  You need that field ON as soon as possible. This is the heart of the deck.  Now, let's talk about our boss monster: Balerdroch. Very easy to summon, once it's on the field it can negate zombies monsters' effects and banish one monster from play or graveyard. That makes him a difficult monster to deal with. That's why we need Zombie World: as opponent's monsters become zombies you can chain their effects with Balerdroch.  Then, if you manage to draw ""Rivalry of the Warlords"" your victory is getting closer. What does Rivalry? Once on the field each player can control only 1 monster type. So, if Zombie World is ON, your opponent cannot summon from his hand/deck/extra-deck as long as he has a monster on his field that is zombie. A very powerful tool that locks completely your opponent.  <strong>Key cards</strong>  - Uni-Zombie: it's our combo starter. You can foolish a zombie monster from the deck and discard from the hand. Both effect once per turn. Targets: Banshee Necroworld, Mezuki, Gozuki, Glow-Up Bloom, Balerdroch...  - Banshee Necroworld: By banishing it from the graveyard or field you can activate a ""Zombie World"" from your deck or hand.  - Mezuki: by banishing it from the graveyard you can target one of your zombie monsters in the GY and special summon it. The good news here is that effect is not once per turn!  - Solitaire Shiranui: Its role is to increase our chances to get Uni-Zombie in our first hand. By tributing a zombie monster (you can tribute that card) you can special summon a tuner/zombie monster from your deck. Target will usually be Uni-Zombie but you can search Glow-up Bloom as well if you need it.  - Gozuki: Another combo starter but less powerful than Uni-Zombie. It can foolish from the deck too + if sent to the GY you can banish another monster in it and special summon a zombie monster from your hand.  - Glow-Up Bloom: a tuner monster which role is to be sent to the graveyard in order to special summon a level 5 or more zombie monster on your field (if Zombie World is ON - otherwise you only get the card in your hand). Target : Balerdroch.  <strong>Danger ! cards role</strong>  The Danger archetype is here to make the deck more consistent. To make some 8 rank XYZ. To special summon some big monsters. To destroy some of your opponent's cards. To draw cards.  <strong>Why 3 copies of Crossout?</strong>  The deck is very sensitive to handtraps. Especially the most used one: Ash. If your opponent Ashes Uni-Zombie it will become difficult to start your combos. So, Crossout is here to protect you from Ash. Crossout can also prevent your opponent from using ""Called by"". That card is also a strong threat to the deck as it can banish and negate Balerdroch trying to return on the field.  Another possibility is to negate for one turn Rivalry if you need to summon a non-zombie monster from your extradeck.  <strong>What is the main combo of the deck? </strong> The Halqifibrax one.  To make this combo we only need to activate Zombie World and have Uni-Zombie and another monster. Special summon Halqifibrax by sending Uni-Zombie and the second monster to the GY. Once Halqi is on the field activate its effect that allows you to special summon a tuner monster from your deck or hand. The target is: Glow-up bloom. At that point, depending on what you have in your hand, two scenarios:  - If you still have Danger ! monster to play, extradeck monsters to summon that are not zombies, do not send Glow-up bloom to the GY until you didn't finish your other combos. Because Glow-up bloom will not allow you to special summon non-zombie monster for the rest of the turn if you used its effect.  - If you don't have anything to do let's special summon Linkuriboh by using Glow-Up bloom. Once Glow-up Bloom is sent to the GY you can activate its effect and special summon Balerdroch.  Use Balerdroch and your Linkuriboh to make Vampire Sucker. Then, end your turn.  At the opponent's standbyphase you will revive your Balerdroch. That will trigger Vampire Sucker's effect: you draw 1 card.  When your opponent summon a monster, activate Halqifibrax's effect: it will banish itself in order to summon a tuner synchro monster from your extradeck. Target: Formula Synchron. Once Formula Synchron hits the field you can activate its effect and draw 1 card.  Formula Synchron has a second effect that allows you to perform a synchro summon during your opponent's turn. The target is Shiranui Sunsaga. Before doing this, be sure you used the effects of Balerdroch. Once Sunsaga is on the field you can at any moment return synchro zombie monster(s) that are in the GY or banished to your extradeck and destroy the same amount of cards your opponent controls.  This combo if not interrupted by your opponent can lead you to an easy win.  Have fun with this deck!"

Well not anymore!  (The Deck Description is the size of a Steven King novel, so make sure","One of the first things you might notice, this deck has 45 cards. Feel free to remove 5, but I feel like it's better to have 5 extra cards. Utopia is a great deck. While it used to be an OTK tool with Utopia Double and Double or Nothing, it's now able to produce actual negates and good interactions. So lets do the card by card for the deck.  Main Deck.  The Onomat Trio: Utopic Onomatopoeia x2, Zubababancho Gagagacoat, and Dodododwarf Gogogoglove. These 3 cards are the main cards of the deck. If you can get 2 of these on board, you get a rank 4. If you get 2 of these on board and any other lvl 4, you can get 2 rank 4s. Zubababancho Gagagacoat can revive any Gogogo or Dododo in your graveyard, and Dodododwarf Gogogoglove can revive itself if you have another Gogogo/Dododo on your field. This means that you can cycle these level 4s every turn, mid combo, and when trying to rebuild a broken board.  The ZS's: ZS - Ascended Sage x2, ZS Armed Sage x2. These 2 ZS's allow for you to get free special summons and free cards. Ascended sage allows you to summon itself when you have no cards on field, and Armed sage when you have only 1 monster. But be very careful. If you activate a card like Onomatopickup, a continuous spell (I'll get to it in a minute,) You can't special summon Ascended Sage. But you can still normal it. And now take that same situation, you activate Pickup, then summon a lvl 4. Armed sage says ""The only monster you control is a lvl 4 or lower"" So even if you have a spell/trap on the field, it can be summoned.  Astral Cards: Astral Kuriboh x2 and Astraltopia x2 These 2 monsters are also free special summons, but with a few more restrictions. Astral Kuriboh allows you to reveal any Number in the extra deck, and summon it. Then its level is equal to it's rank. But guess what? It can be any level. While in Utopic, the only level you want to have it be is level 4, if you splash it into any other deck that plays numbers, you have a free summon of any level you need. When it is summoned, be careful. Because it Locks you into numbers while it's on the field. As soon it's used for an Xyz though, that lock goes away. In addition to being a free summon of any level, the monster you summon with Astral Kuriboh can't be destroyed by battle or card effect. So you can wall up with this card in a pinch. And Astraltopia, the better card. ""If an Xyz monsters(s) is on the field: You can special summon this card from your hand."" Notice how this is the Field, not your side of the field. In addition of that effect, it can send 1 card from the hand or field (which you have numerus targets to send, and yes, pun intended) to add one Xyz, Onomat, Zexal, or Number S/t from the deck to the hand. This means that if you go 2nd, you can summon this if the opponent has an xyz, possibly bait out a negate, and keep your normal summon. If not, you can still search MANY cards. As I go through the list, I'll point out the cards to search.  Onomat Spells: Onomatopaira x3, Onomatopickup x3. Onomatopaira allows you to discard 1, add any 2 cards from the Dododo/Gogogo/Gagaga/Zubaba archetype to the hand. This is probably one of the best searchers in all of yugioh. Most of the time, if you have a card from the Onomat trio in your hand, you search the other 2 cards in it and go full combo. If you don't you search Utopic Onomatopoeia (since it's treated as all of those cards) and Zubababancho Gagagacoat. You then normal summon the Utopic Onomat, and summon Bancho. If it's negated with a veiler or impermanence, you can use Bancho's effect in hand to summon it. If it's destroyed by a ghost ogre and snow rabbit, then you still summon Bancho, then revive Utopic Onomat. If it's negated AND destroyed, tough luck. And remember what I said about Paira being the best searcher? Onomatopickup is even better. In your starting hand, if you draw Zubababancho Gagagacoat and Dodododward Gogogoglove, but no Utopic Onomat, then you can use Pickup to search just that. No Discards. Side Note: These two cards are great search targets off of Astraltopia if you haven't normal summoned.  Reinforcement of the Army: Add any lvl 4 or lower warrior. It's a great searcher, and the only 2 targets we can't add are Dodododwarf Gogogoglove and Astral Kuriboh.  Zexal Construction x3: This card is amazing as well. (I've said that about 4 cards now I think.) It allows you to shuffle one of your garnets into the deck, or a useless card. Then you can add one of 5 archetypes, even though we aren't playing any Rank-Down-Magic cards. I'll also show you the garnets that you'll want to shuffle back with this.  Zexal Entrust x1: This card is mostly a search target for niche things. It's a great extender allowing you to summon a ZS from the gy, or a ZW if you want to buff your Xyz a little more. Summon a Utopia is only useful for one situation, which can only happen if you misplay in a BIG way. It also has a gy effect! If you're 2000 lp lower than your opponent, you can add another Zexal card from the gy to the hand. Our only target is Construction, but it is really good. Side Note: Great target to search with Construction &amp; Astraltopia.  Hyper Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce x1: Yes, that's the name. This card is searchable off of Construction and ZS Ascended Sage. This allows you to go into a 4 material Dragonar (Which I'll get to in a minute.) And when you summon an Xyz with a Utopia/Utopics effect, you get to attach this card to it as material. One of the best Rank-Up-Magic cards out there.  Numbers Protect x1: It's an Omni negate that is also a counter trap. It's searchable off of Astraltopia, and it has a gy effect to bring itself back. Need I say more?  Xyz Change Tactics x2: Pay 500 every Xyz summon of a Utopia, draw 1. No Once per turn. This card can be searched off of Astraltopia, and is a great way to set up for next turn.  Double or nothing x2: This is only useful for Utopia Double into Utopia for 10k damage, but otherwise, just a search target so Utopia Double can rank itself up.  The ZW's: Tornado Bringer, Lightning Blade, Pegasus Twin Saber x1. These can be searched by Construction, and by Armed Sage.  Tornado bringer allows you to equip it to a Utopia, and it gets 1300 atk with the ability to not be targeted. Lightning Blade gives it 1200 attack, and ZW's can't be destroyed. Pegasus Twin Saber can equip from the Field (keep that in mind) and give it 1000 attack. Pegasus has the additional effect to negate any monster effect that activates on the field. This can ignore chain blocking, and they can't respond to it since it doesn't activate. The only problem with this is that you have to either equip it from deck, or summon it. And it's a level 5 monster. It does have a way to summon itself though! If you're lp are 2000 lower than your opponents, you can summon it for free. This can be done with Xyz Change tactics, summon 4 Utopics. Which is actually really easy with the right hand.  Tech Cards: Called By the grave x1, Feather Duster x1, Monster Reborn x1: Called by the grave is a way to protect yourself from HT, since an ash blossom on a Paira will devastate you, essentially ending the turn. It's also a negate for GY decks. Feather duster for backrow, since the only other card we have is Tornado Dragon, meaning that a mystic mine when you don't have tornado is an FTK. it's also good for generic Backrow decks, like Eldlich (With 3 Skill Drain might I add) and Guru. Lastly, Reborn. The most common level in the game is level 4, and any level 4 and a reborn means you can go off from there. You can reborn one of your cards, one of your opponents, it's great.  Forbidden Droplet x2: This is a tech card, but it needs its own category. Utopia decks have a lot of cards that get used once and that's it. For example, you go full combo with an Xyz Change Tactics, you have Droplet. After going for a full combo, you'll only have a few Utopias left to summon, making Tactics a great target to send. Then you have the ZWs, good cards, but a Tornado Bringer isn't good against a deck that doesn't target. And you still have Onomatopickup, which has an on field effect only good for Tag Duels and if you summon a ZW. And the last card, Double Or Nothing, is useless after full combo. Since we're only playing 1 Number 39: Utopia, and full combo uses it for Dragonar, you can't use the Double or nothing in hand anymore.  HT: Ash Blossom x3, Infinite Impermanence x3: Ash is great, Impermanence is great. You can replace these with the HT of your choice, but my personal choice are these.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck: Number 99: Utopia Dragonar x2. This is insane. Not just for Utopia, but for all number decks. When you do your combo, this has 4 materials. And it can use 2 materials to summon any 1 number that has a number between 1 and 100 in the text (So no, you can't make a iC1000 FTK deck.) as a quick effect. This means you can summon a card during your turn, then on the opponents. Targets for this include: Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon, Number 38 hope Harbinger, Number 23, Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld, Number 100; Numeron Dragon. I'll go over these cards seperately.  Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon. For the millionth time, this card is insane. During the ep, detatch one, banish all cards your opponent controls that have been summoned or set this turn. Including s/t cards. If the opponent can't go through 3 negates, you can use this to kick them while they're down, and banish their floodgates, their traps, their Droplets. And if your opponent has a monster with high attack, and they have low lp, you can crash this into that monster and they take the damage. And on top of that, if it's destroyed by a card effect while it has xyz Material, which will almost never happen, it gets 1000 attack for every card that is banished. And if you're against a Swordsoul deck, or a Gren Maju deck that banished 3x Gren Maju, then you'll have just a few attack points to attack for lethal over the opponents 30k attack Gren Maju.  Number 38: Hope Harbinger. It's a spell negate, it's can attach a spell as Material. Great against Sky Striker decks, or any deck that use a lot of spells. And in a Mirror, you can attach an opponents Hyper Rank up Magic.  Number 23: Lancelot. This is a weird card. The first two effects it has are useless, so forget about those. This card is an omni negate. Nothing else to say about that. But it's a mandatory negate. If you  activate a card while it still has materials, you will be negating yourself. So be extra careful.  Numeron Dragon. This card needs no introduction. Detach one, gain a million atk. When summoning off of a Dragonar, this will have a minimum of 13000 attack. Compare that to Draglubion, making it 9k. Still a lot, but it almost never will OTK when the opponent is at 8k.  Leo Utopia Ray. It can detatch one, equip a ZW from the deck to itself. This allows it to become two negates. The first, by its own effect, being able to target a card on the field and negate and half its attack permanently. The 2nd negate is Pegasus Twin Saber, which we talked about earlier. You will only be getting the Pegasus twin saber, since you'll only have 1 material for it. If you drew the Pegasus twin saber, or are worried about targeted removal, get Tornado bringer.  Utopia Double x2; This card allows us to rank up into any Utopic monster in the extra deck. If we only have 2 level 4s, Utopia double into Leo will be good. For an OTK strategy, you can either go for Utopia Double into a Utopia for the classic 10k, or after the main combo, or if Hyper Rank up Magic is in the gy, you can Utopia double into a Dragonar, summoning a Numeron Dragon for 13k.  Number 39: Utopia. It allows us to go for a Dragonar, and OTK with a 10k beater.  Number S39: Utopia Prime. The Effect miiiggght be used, but almost never. The only other use is Dragonar, giving it another material. You can replace this with C39: Utopia Ray.  Tornado Dragon. This allows us to get 1. a Non-number rank 4 onto the field (you'll see why) and some free s/t removal.  ZS - Utopic Sage. This allows us to summon a ZS to the field, and in extension, add any Rank up magic or ZW to hand It's also the 2nd non number rank 4. Why would we need non number rank 4s?  Utopic Future &amp; Utopic Future Draco. These cards can be built into the main combo. Utopic Future allows us to steal a monster the opponent controls for the battle phase, and Future Draco is a monster negate and it's able to take control of a negated monster effect if it's on the field.  Side Deck: You can do anything for it, but my personal choice is to have a Number 89 in there, along with ht and Mystic Mine hate.  Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker. Its good for decks that rely on one card in their extra deck that they only have one of. Also FTK decks, but that's a niche use.  Nibiru: Going 2nd tool against ss decks.  Gameciel: Good against tower decks, could possibly replace this with Evenly.  Lancea: Good for banish decks like Swordsoul.  Token Collector: Good against Swordsoul and Brave Token decks.  Droll &amp; Lock Birb: Good for decks that search the entire deck.  The Mystic Mine hate: This deck is mostly for casual, but is still good for meta play. And before you ask, Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell is a card I chose to put in there on purpose.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Combos.  Ascended Sage Combo: End board = Leo Utopia Ray, Pegasus twin saber, Dragonar, Lancelot, and a Hear-eartH/Number 38 on the opponents turn.  Starting hand must include: A way to get to any of the 2 Onomat trio + ZS Ascended sage.  Summon Ascended Sage.  Summon the 2 Onomat Trio.  If the two cards are:  Utopic Onomatopoeia &amp; Dodododwarf: Use Dodododwarf + ZS Ascended Sage for a Utopia Double. Use double, add Rank Up Magic Utopiforce, use Double again, detach Dodododwarf, go into a Leo. Use Dwarf effect in the GY, summon it back.  Utopic Onomatopoeia &amp; Zubababancho: Use Onomatopoeia + ZS Ascended Sage for a Utopia Double. Use double, add Rank Up Magic Utopiforce, use Double again,  detach Onomatopoeia, go into a Leo. Use Coat effect, summon the Onomatopoeia back.  Dodododwarf &amp; Zubababancho: Use Dodododwarf + ZS Ascended Sage for a Utopia Double. Use double, add Rank Up Magic Utopiforce, use Double again,  detach Dodododwarf, go into a Leo. Use Coat effect, summon the Dwarf back.  Use the 2 level 4s to go into a Utopia, use Utopia to go into Utopia Prime, then use Utopiforce to go into Dragonar. Before using Dragonar, use Leos effect to equip Pegasus twin saber to it as material. Now use Dragonar, summon the Number 23, Lancelot. Use Utopiforce in gy to attach itself as material. During the opponents turn, wait until they activate something and Lancelot negates to use Dragonar. Summon Number 38, or Heart-eartH dragon during the ep, depending on what deck you think they have.  Main Combo: This one's a doozy. End board: Leo Utopia Ray, Pegasus Twin Saber, Dragonar with 2 materials, and Utopic Draco Future.  Starting hand: A way to get to all 3 of the Onomat Trio.  Summon Utopic Onomat, use the effect, summon Dwarf and coat from your hand.  Use Utopic Onomat &amp; Dwarf to go into ZS - Utopic Sage.  Use Sage effect, summon ZS - Ascended Sage.  Use Coat effect, summon Utopic Onomat.  Use Dwarf effect in gy, ss itself.  Use any of the onomat cards and Ascended Sage, go into Number 39: Utopia.  Use Effect, add Utopiforce.  Go into Utopia Prime.  Use Utopiforce, summon Dragonar.  Use Dragonar, summon Leo.  Use Utopiforce in gy: Attach to Leo.  Use the other 2 level 4s on the field, go into Tornado Dragon.  Use tornado dragon + Utopic Sage. Go into F0 Utopic Future. Then go into F0 Utopic Future Draco.  Use Leo, equip Pegasus Twin Saber.  This gets you 3 monster negates, and then either an Omni Negate, a Spell negate that you can do multiple times during the duel, and then a Heart-eartH dragon at the end phase.  Small Side note for main combo: If you have a way to get all 3 of the Onomat trio + Astraltopia, you can go even further beyond.  You do the main combo, but when you get to the part where you summon Utopic Sage, instead summon Utopia Double.  Then use Double to go into leo, use leo to make sure you still have the two Onomats in the grave.  Then summon them back with Coat and the gy effect of Dwarf, then summon Utopic Sage now.  Use sage, summon Ascended sage, then do the Dragonar line with Utopia, Utopia Prime, and Utopiforce.  Before activating Dragonar though, summon the Astraltopia, and use the effect sending the Double or nothing searched by utopia Double to add Zexal Entrust.  Now use Dragonar, and make sure to detatch ZS - Ascended Sage, and go for a number 38. Activate Entrust, bring back the Ascended Sage, and go for Tornado, and then Utopic Future into Utopic Draco Future.  If you discard a ZS when getting to the 3 Onomat cards, by means of Onomatopaira, you wait to use dragonar, then use entrust to summon the discarded ZS, and  you make Future Draco. Then summon Lancelot off of Dragonar.  Thank you for going through the guide and dedicating a good 2-3 hours into reading, and good luck, have fun!  (Last side note, I swear. This deck is completely legal in Master Duel, so consider using this if you're willing to spend a few hundred more!)  &nbsp;"

The Dogma cards are mainly there to give you some control if you open a bad hand but with this list with a semi decent hand you should be able to end on Shuraig, Dragoon and maybe 1 melffy xyz if you have the extra materials.  If you have any suggestions either for a different Dogma package or want to show me a better decklist pls feel free I love learning more and seeing how other decks play.  Enjoy this list and if you use it a do well let me know.  &nbsp;"

Preferably with Chick banished for no battle phase shenanigans.)  <strong>Core Ratios:</strong>  <span>Main Deck </span>  3)  <em>Tiger</em> because soft One Per Turn clauses are easily subverted by bouncing. Also a<em> Daruma Doll</em> target for backrow popping/revivial  <em>Marten</em> because you can bounce <em>Tiger</em> and get more fusion/link material through its revival(or go into <em>Tiger King</em>)  <em>Kaldeo Chick</em> because 1)dumping for cost means negates don't affect the dumping, 2)you can cheat our your fusions with the name change, 3)battle protection means no 3500 damage to you via <em>Magic Cylinder</em>, and 4)<em>Polymerization</em> recycling. Also level 4 for <em>Tiger King</em>.  <em>Lunalight Fusion</em>, despite being a Hard Once Per Turn, means you can get <em>Leo Dancer</em> out with two Lunalight Monsters in hand and an Extra Deck on the opp's field. Also searchable by <em>Marten</em>.  <em>Luna Light Perfume</em> (which, do note, is NOT searchable by <em>Marten</em> because of that extra space in ""Luna Light"") is archetypal Revival and Deck searching, not Once Per Turn. Need I say more?  2)  <em>White Rabbit</em> is nice revival and backrow bouncing, but having the revival on normal summon is rough due to Chick usually being a better call.  <em>Emerald Bird</em> is nice recovery, helps un-brick hands and get other Lunalights into grave and yet another Tiger King material...but <em>Chick</em> is still a better normal summon, and the discard can be a bit awkward.  <em>Black Sheep</em>...honestly could be at 3, since it pays for itself through both of its effects, but I find that it being in your opening hand with no other lunalights in hand can be rough.  <em>Allure of Darkness</em> because you run a lot of Darks, but you do have the occasional Light monster. I can see this at 3 if you can take the risk.  1)  <em>Tenki</em> honestly could also be at 3 since it is an amazing searcher, but usually 1 does the job enough for me. More room for handtraps.  <em>Foolish Burial Goods</em> could also be at three since it gets <em>Perfume</em> and <em>Serenade Dance</em> into grave, but as one who doesn't run Pots, hand space can be tight.  <em>Purple Butterfly</em> is nice attack boosting and gets Lunalights out of  your hand, but I would rather see it more in grave than in hand.  <em>Blue Cat</em> because you only need one for the atk boost and sadly Mystic Tomato strats in this day and age aren't nearly as viable with all the negates and banishing.  <em>Crimson Fox</em> is nice targeting protection and atk dropping which is good for early setup or baiting, but your Big Boss Fusions all have some protection and you have other ways of boosting attack.  <em>Polymerization/Fusion Substitute</em> since you can recover both via <em>Chick</em>...but you also have<em> Lunalight Fusion</em>.  <em>Serenade Dance</em> is something you want to see in grave far more than in hand for the revival effect, but at least is a target for <em>Martin</em> in a pinch and an extra card for <em>White Rabbit</em> bouncing (remember, Lunalight <strong><em>cards</em></strong>, not just Monsters).  <em>Revolt</em> because it is a nice way to recover your banished monsters...but you probably have your other <em>Tri-Brigade</em> links in the grave barring <em>Shuraig</em>, so having more than one can be dead draws.  &nbsp;  <span>Extra Deck</span>  2)  All fusions but <em>Cat Dancer</em>-Two <em>Leo Dancers</em> are more than enough to OTK, Two <em>Saber Dancers</em> to have one on field and one for the attack boost, Two <em>Panther Dancers</em> in case they banish your first from the grave.  1)  <em>Cat Dancer</em> mostly because you'll be dumping <em>Panther Dancer</em> through <em>Chick</em> instead. Is a nice first turn option if you can't get to <em>Leo Dancer</em>, though.  <em>Tri-Brigade</em> links are pretty much to get a banish off the field or to link climb into your other archetypal boss monsters.  <em>Daruma Doll</em> is nice backrow removal and helps link climb.  &nbsp;  <strong>Optional Staples</strong>  <span>Main Deck</span>  <em>Maxx C</em> gives you a free turn to OTK or helps unbrick a hand.  <em>Called by The Grave</em> makes sure no Ashes ruin your Perfume searches.  <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> since it gets things into grave as well as negates your opp's boss monster  <em>Twin Twisters</em> and <em>Harpies' Feather Duster</em> because, since this is Best of 1, backrow removal is a good bit more important if you don't want <em>Eldlich/Sky Striker</em> to ruin your day.  <em>Raigeki/Lightning Storm</em> because nothing is more funny than blowing up a field that your opponent played Solitaire to get.  <em>Monster Reborn</em> because being a lesser <em>Luna Light Perfume</em> is still pretty nice.  <span>Extra Deck</span>  <em>Accesscode</em> OTK's with a Link 3 material and <em>Leo Dancer</em>, though I can see <em>Borrelsword </em>being here as well.  <em>Masquerena</em> gives your Link-4 Boss monsters some protection  <em>Avramax </em>is more of a first turn option, since it is an annoyance to get off the field with <em>Masquerena</em> protection and can't be beaten over unless they force a negate.  &nbsp;  This is probably not the most optimized build, so modify this at your leisure, but I feel this is a decent skeleton for the Lunalight deck in Master Duel. Have fun dancing your way to OTKs!  &nbsp;"

Also, Lava Golem + Gozen Match/Rivalry of Warlords, is pretty strong and annoying locking your opponent to Fire or Fiend. Against Swordsoul and PK its strong.  &nbsp;  <span>Rivalry won't be as strong next meta because PK and Swordsoul will dominate as DIS (Dogmatika, Invoker, Shadoll) won't be as played as much with the recent small nerf. But with the new brave Engine it will actually mess up a lot of decks that use Brave engine, due to the token being a fairy, as a lot of rouge decks that use brave engine will start to pop up and may become meta like ABC's. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side deck is probably weird, but this is for the next <strong>Meta. </strong></span>  <span>Dark bribe in General is a trash card and you're wondering why not just run the 3rd judgment? After play testing you are using a shit ton of life points from solemn judgement, solemn strike, and the 3 skill drains. you will always be on the edge of life points, and I've had dead cards like strike and skill drain because I've used so much life points especially solemn judgment due to force negate like lightning storm and twin twisters of course I could always use Eldlich to just dump dead cards. In a floodgate/stun deck, it's not a bad card letting your opponent draw one card while skill drained, gozen matched, etc, it isn't going to do much. Letting your opponent Draw one card unless they draw another spell/trap removal it's not a bad card. If I had 5 back row and had some floodgate cards like summon limit or solemn strike, they lightning storm me I would rather dark bribe than solemn judgment. Also, you won't get psy-gamma and can stop cosmic cyclone.</span>  <span>Why Summon limit? A strong going first turn card, shuts down every combo decks. but it's just my personal preference. </span>  Reason why I run 3 twin twisters instead of 3 lightning storm is because after play testing <b>a lot </b>of people have been siding royal degrees. The issue with lighting storm is when u flip a floodgate card like gozen match you can't activate lightning storm of course u have ways like using Eldlich but twin twisters just way more reliable removing royal degree and back row because it's a quick spell.  Artifact lancea &gt; Iron wall, Lancea is strong against evenly match and cosmic cyclone.  The imperial iron wall is extremely strong against in mirror match or decks that banishes a lot more than you but use it wisely as it hurts you as well, but you have the power to pop your own iron wall.  You're going 2nd cards lava, golem, super poly, and Lancea.  &nbsp;  <span>your super poly targets and when to side super poly in.</span>  <span>1.Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord (Eldlich"" monster + 1 Level 5 or higher Zombie monster) Good for Mirror match or for some reason zombie decks.</span>  <span>2. Predaplant Triphyoverutum (3 DARK monsters on the field) This game can win you games it has a really good effect and u can target 3 dark monsters very powerful against Phantom knights </span>  3. Starving Venom Fusion Dragon (2 DARK monsters on the field, except Tokens) Good against Phantom Knights or combine it with Verte and Dragoon  4. Mudragon of the Swamp (2 monsters with the same Attribute but different Types) Another good backup fusion.  5. Prank-Kids Weather Washer - (2 ""Prank-Kids"" monsters) Prank kids.

Fusion Destiny and A Hero Lives both got put to 2, which means HERO decks weren't affected too badly.  &nbsp;  Anyways, this HERO deck uses 2 copies of D - Force instead of Evil HERO Adusted Gold and Dark Calling, to both search Destiny HERO - Plasma and screw over your opponent while you've got Plasma out!

Though OTKs are what most Cyber Dragon decks are known for the purpose of this Cyber Dragon deck build deck is to be a control beatdown deck using Cybernetic Overflow to help control, Cyber Dragon Infinity to help stun, and Cyberload Fusion to help push for OTK. There are various ways to go into Cyber Dragon Nova and Cyber Dragon Infinity YET timing their summons is crucial. Several times going into Cyber Dragon Nova and Cyber Dragon Infinity is not necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck build runs 3 copies of Cybernetic Overflow to help control and 2 copies of Cyberload Fusion to take full advantage of Cybernetic Overflow's banishing costs (Keep in mind that if Cybernetic Overflow is destroyed while on field it becomes an extender by helping add 1 ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from deck to hand). Machine Duplication is a VERY powerful card and is ran at 2, 3 can become bricks. (Helps go into Cyber Dragon Nova which can then go into Cyber Dragon Infinity very quickly). Cyber Repair Plant is ran at 3 to further help deck search especially when needing to search for Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju. (Can easily be ran at 2 or 1 depending on preference). Foolish Burial is primarily used to trigger Cyber Dragon Herz (Can also be used to set up a Cyber Dragon in GY if Cyber Dragon Nachster is in hand for Cyber Dragon Nachster to be normal or special summoned to then target Cyber Dragon in GY and special summon it OR to have more Cyber Dragon variety in GY for Cybernetic Overflow's banishing costs). One for One is primarily used to help set up a board for Machine Duplication though One for One can be used in many different ways depending on resources on field, hand and grave (Can be used to send Cyber Dragon Herz from hand to GY to trigger Herz effect, Can be used to special summon Herz to trigger Herz special summon effect, Can be used to special summon Cyber Dragon Nachster to trigger Cyber Dragon Nachster's effect, Can be used to help set the board for a Cyber Dragon Drei normal summon effect, Can be used to have variance for Cybernetic Overflow). Running 2 Cyber Dragon Sieger, 2 Chimeratech Fortress Dragon and 2 Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon makes this build a bit more competitive and can easily be done by taking out the 3 Cyberdark fusion monsters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Key Takeaways:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Core - Literally the core of this deck. Normal summon to add 1 ""Cyber"" Spell/trap from deck to hand. Can literally search all ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap cards including Cyberdark spells and traps. Cyber Dragon Core can be targeted by Machine Duplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Emergency - Literally the extender of this deck. Adds 1 ""Cyber Dragon"" monster from deck to hand or 1 Light machine monster that cannot be normal summoned/Set (Cyber Eltanin)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Herz - When Special summoned its level becomes 5. When sent to graveyard it allows to to add 1 ""Cyber Dragon"" from Deck or GY to hand. (Keep in mind all monsters in this deck build are considered ""Cyber Dragon"" when on field or graveyard, allowing Cyber Dragon Herz to add any Cyber Dragon monsters from graveyard back to hand). Cyber Dragon Herz can be targeted by Machine Duplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Nachster - When normal or special summoned you can target 1 machine monster with 2100 ATK or DEF in your GY, special summon it. (Ideal combo is to special summon Cyber Dragon Nachster from hand by sending an original Cyber Dragon from hand to GY then targeting that sent Cyber Dragon in GY and special summoning it. Targets that Cyber Dragon Nachster can special summon from graveyard are Cyber Dragon, Cyber Dragon Nova,Cyber Dragon Infinity, Cyberdark Chimera. Cyber Twin Dragon, and Chimeratech Rampage Dragon) Cyber Dragon Nachster can be targeted by Machine Duplication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Drei - When normal summoned you can make all ""Cyber Dragon"" you currently control become level 5. (Ideal combo for Cyber Dragon Drei is activating Cyber Dragon Nachster effect in hand to special summon Cyber Dragon Nachster then following up with normal summoning Cyber Dragon Drei to convert all Cyber Dragon monsters on field to LVL 5 then to go into Cyber Dragon Nova and Cyber Dragon Infinity). Another way to make Cyber Dragon Nova is by having Cyber Dragon Vier in hand when normal summoning Cyber Dragon Drei. (When normal summoned Cyber Dragon Drei's effect can be activated AND Cyber Dragon Vier's special summon effect can be chained to Cyber Dragon Drei's effect to make both Cyber Dragon Drei and Cyber Dragon Vier level 5).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Dragon Vier - Can be Special summoned from hand in DEF position if you normal or special summon ""Cyber Dragon"". Gives each ""Cyber Dragon: you control a 500 ATK and DEF boost. (This is a special summon after summoning any Cyber Dragon monster. Helps have resources for going into Cyber Dragon Sieger AND can be chained to Cyber Dragon Drei's normal summon effect to help make resources for Cyber Dragon Nova).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyber Eltanin - helps clear the board; when summoned, sends all monsters on the field to the GY. Can be searched with Cyber Emergency and Cyber Repair Plant. Cyber Eltanin's special summon requirements also helps push all Cyber Dragon variants from fiedl and GY to the banish pile setting up resources for a Cyberload Fusion OTK.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jizukiru, Kaiju - helps get rid of an opponent's OMNI negate and can be contact fused with any ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field to make Chimeratech Fortress Dragon. Can also be used to make Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon if opponent has a monster in an extra monster zone. Can only be searched with Cyber Repair Plant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyberdark Side Deck&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cyberdark cards can easily be swapped in by cutting down on ""3 ofs"" and ""2 ofs"".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When swapping in Cyberdark cards please keep in mind that this dilutes the Cyber Dragon&nbsp;</p><p>deck build consistency. Having familiarity with how how Cyber Dragon and Cyberdark work individually vastly helps.

Duel Master:</strong> Charmers Deck  <img src=""https://nintendo-power.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1641952974_Yu-ki-oh-Preview-Master-Duel-Nintendo-Switch-Tower.jpg"" alt=""image"" />  The “Charmer”, or known as the “Spirit Charmer” is a standalone archetype of Spellcaster monster themed on controlling monsters with the same Attribute as them which is unfortunately not playable in any way without an exceptional support from another card. Surprisingly the new Archetype called “Magistus” came out soon after the “Spirit Charmer” was released in 2021. The “Magistus” archetype had a perfect synergy for the “Charmers” especially since they only rely on base from Attribute and Types. This deck is strong enough to be used in high Tier level on Master Duel or Tournaments(hopefully).... This build is very easy to obtain/play it and can be used for any newcomer duelist because most of the cards are actually straightforward for the combos which I already listed the key cards for anyone interested to play Charmer Deck.  Start with only using 3 simple Key Cards which is the only best I ever come out with for the Full Charmer's combos.  Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below. ___________________________________________  <strong>[Key Cards]</strong>: 3 Main Engine - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a> - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a> - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  <strong>[Recommend]</strong> to Search/Use - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand) - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden"">Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</a> (Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  ___________________________________________  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” effect to send out “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon “<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both “<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>” and “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back “<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>” from the GY to the field along with “<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>” by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use “<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>” effect to search out “<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>” from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  ___________________________________________  <strong>Tips</strong>: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use Familiar-Possessed - Lyna's Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  ___________________________________________  <strong>[Additional] </strong>for more Consistency You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need. Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include “<a data-name=""Summoner Mon"">Summoner Mon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Summoner Mon&quot;&gt;Summoner Mon&lt;/a&gt;k"">k</a>” from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster.  ___________________________________________  The End Board got changed frequently due to lack of cards since I actually used Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon lately in the actual game which is not my original plan for this deck. So I came up with the new play style by giving you more options to play either ""<a data-name=""Number 106: Giant Hand"">Number 106: Giant Hand</a>"" or summon any link 2 like ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>"" depending on any situation if you have more additional cards on your play to expand it.  I want to try something new in Master Duel with different cards that I have so it got changed especially from the Extra Deck. You can still use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as usual to link summon “<a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magician"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magician</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Selene, Queen of the Master Magician&quot;&gt;Selene, Queen of the Master Magician&lt;/a&gt;s"">s</a>” or ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>"" during your opponent's turn.  <span>There's a ton of cards that can be used for the Charmer deck strategies with different combination cards as we play them. You can still change it and/or make them stronger as you like.

And i swapped an astraltopia for a second astral kuriboh cause in playtesting if you draw too much astraltopia you're kinda dead in the water. aand i also swapped tornado for lightning blade.  banlist: added feather duster to the main deck due to skill drain being unlimited, although i took out xyz tactics for it buut basically the card isn't really needed and more overkill than nessesary, plus i don't really want to be drawing into any of my searchables with it either.  and for the extra deck i basically remade it, due to opening a bunch of space from F0 and the searcher xyz's going away, i added a second U-Double and utopia, and some more dragonar targets with 71, 84, 41, and 4(kragen). i also took out tornado dragon due to skill drain.  &nbsp;  i would replace the effect veilers here for forbidden chalice, but i currently don't have any forbidden chalices"

(I know how daunting it","Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with a more compact version of my previous Extra Deck Eldlich Monarch deck list that I posted a while ago as per request of the user GreenION. I've done most of the explanations there when it comes to my choices and general thought processes there so feel free to take a look at it if you fancy at this link down here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/eldlich-extra-deck-monarchs-master-duel/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/eldlich-extra-deck-monarchs-master-duel/</a>  No significant changes into the deck with the exception of it being the deck size from a 60 card list down to just 45, which isn't that bad, all things considered. One thing that you might consider adjusting the ratios of since this is a significantly smaller deck is <a data-name=""Ehther, the Heavenly Monarch"">Ehther, the Heavenly Monarch</a> and <a data-name=""Erebus, the Underworld Monarch"">Erebus, the Underworld Monarch</a>. I personally prefer having more Ehther than Erebus and drawing them both when going second and especially when going first. Drawing Erebus going second would be stronger, though you can just tinker the ratios to your liking. So, yeah that's pretty much it."

The deck is capable to break board going second. It can also build a decent board going first. However, the main issue with madolche is consistency. Therefore, pot of prosperity is important. If pot of prosperity is too expensive, pot of extravagance can replace however it is way less good since madolche do not need the extra card. They need the key card. The second card is small world. It allows to search mageline, angelly or petite through hand traps which are all key starters of the combo. ex of small world: ash blossom -&gt; hootcake -&gt; and lvl4 madolche, or ghost bell -&gt; veiler -&gt; mageline  Having different hand trap for small world is also in synergy with crossout.  depending on the handtrap that you have there are multiple different ways to search the card through small world. If both previously mentioned cards are too expensive, you can choose to play a more going second version which drops all hand trap, pot, and small world (I admit that they are expensive) and adds cards which break boards such as dark ruler, harpie, kaiju, nibiru, and raigeki (back at 3 with the jan 2022 banlist).  In this deck, there is no side deck because it really depends on the format.  I do suggest cards like dark ruler, dimension shifter, lancea, droll. Regardless of what you choose, I suggest choosing cards that either has a board wipe or influence the entire board effect such as dark ruler or card that apply a rule such as droll, lancea which denie your opponent from one type of effect.  If cards like lightning storm aren't accessible and you need back role removal. Hey Tsunade is a decent choice. Since you do not need multiple turns as madolche player. 1 Turn is often enough.  Personally, the key card that wins me most of my duels is madolche teacher glassoufle. The shuffle-back effect from both gy is a really annoying effect for current format decks. The hard part is to know when to activate it. You have to do it 1 step before your opponent's foolish-like effect. Not 2 steps just 1 in order to trigger glassoufle's effect in the next chainlink.  &nbsp;  Reglardless, Madolche is a deck that have a lot of potential. It is not hard to learn the combo and fun deck."

We can link him off with Almiraj and get to search for any handtrap in the deck or Orange Sunset, which if we have a column setup with Almiraj, we can Special Summon him and link for Verte and so forth.</li> </ul> PS: Lightning Storm is kinda of a double-edge sword and very situational in this deck because it does its job too well.

I was spoon-fed the entire archetype for spending some time in solo mode and then I pulled accescode, almiraj, and abomination.  I was also given link spider for choosing to start off with the cyberse deck, and also unexpected dai for the starting deck.  I pulled the diviners when attempting to make a makeshift megilith deck.  And my favorite part? Almost all of the world chalice link monsters have animations and 10 cards in the extra has animations, it makes it feel alive!  I am really glad and pretty darn lucky.  So here’s my current World Chalice build for master duel"

The Arrival Cyberse having effect immunity gives it unique advantages over certain ,"<span><strong>-Strategy</strong></span>  The main advantage this deck has are the 1-card <span>combos.</span> This gives you a lot of room for the rest of your hand to be dedicated for either countering the opponent's boards or protecting your own plays.  When going first, the goal is to combo into The Arrival Cyberse + Cyberse Quantum Dragon. Most decks can't deal with The Arrival, so as long as you can protect it from getting beaten over you should have control of the game.  When going second, you combo into the 2300 attack Extra Deck @Ignisters and Accesscode Talker to boardwipe the opponent and go for an OTK.  <span><strong>-Decklist</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span><em>Achichi</em>/<em>Pikari</em></span>/<em>Cynet Mining</em>/<em>AI Meet You</em>: These are all essentially your 1-card combo starters. In mid to late game, <em>Pikari</em> gains greater value due to it's ability to search for the in-themed <em>Monster Reborn</em> cards. Do note that <em>AI Meet You</em> is not usually used as a combo starter, so if you use it that way it will produce the weakest board (<em>The Arrival Cyberse</em> without <em>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</em>.)</li>  	<li><em>Ignister AILand</em>/<em>Doyon</em>/<em>Buruburu</em>/<em>Danmari</em>: These are all combo pieces that you get out from the deck to continue your combo. <em>Ignister AILand </em>is used to enable your special summons. <em>Doyon </em>adds @Ignister monsters and spells back to your hand. <em>Buruburu </em>is the Tuner of the deck which can be searched by <em>Cyberse Wicckid</em>. <em>Danmari</em> can be sent from the deck to the grave via <em>Buruburu</em> which allows it to be used as a one time Omni-Negate as long as The Arrival Cyberse on board.</li>  	<li><em>FAIghting Spirit</em>/<em>AIdle Reborn</em>/<em>Monster Reborn: </em>These are all basically <em>Monster Reborn</em> which allows you to recover your plays in case you get interrupted. If you have at least 2 of these, you can recover from <em>Nibiru</em> depending on where in the combo it is activated. <em>FAIghting Spirit </em>has an interesting interaction with <em>Achichi's</em> graveyard effect which results in <em>The Arrival</em> <em>Cyberse</em> from being unable to be destroyed by battle.</li>  	<li><em>Maxx C</em>/<em>Nibiru</em>/<em>Ash Blossom</em>/<em>Ghost</em> <em>Belle</em>/<em>Infinite Impermanence:</em> Due to how compact the combos are, you can afford to play a large variety of hand traps. <em>Maxx C</em> is the only I really consider a must have since it can unbrick your hand or let you draw into <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> or your other handtraps. The rest is up to preference. I only play 1 <em>Ash Blossom</em> and 1 <em>Impermanence</em> for <em>Crossout Designator.</em> <em>Ghost Belle</em> has some interesting application against meta decks like Eldlich and Tri-Brigade, but it is replaceable for something else if you prefer.</li>  	<li><em>Called by the Grave</em>/<em>Crossout Designator</em>: The deck is vulnerable to handtraps so these cards are necessary for protecting your combos.</li>  	<li><em>Forbidden Droplet</em>: Useful whether you are going first or second. When going second, this is your main board breaking card outside of <em>Nibiru</em>. When going first, the attacking reducing effect helps protect <em>The Arrival Cyberse</em> from getting beaten over.</li> </ol> <span><strong>-Extra Deck Combo Routes</strong></span> <ol>  	<li>Dark Infant -&gt; Cyberse Wicckid -&gt; Splash Mage -&gt; Dark Templar (Preferably in the right EMZ) -&gt; Route A or B</li> </ol> A) Summon your second Dark Infant under Dark Templar in the middle column and then combo into Cyberse Quantum Dragon and then The Arrival Cyberse right after.  B) Summon your second Dark Infant under Dark Templar in the middle column and then combo into Wind Pegasus, Light Dragon, and Accesscode Talker for boardwiping and OTK.  2. Accesscode Talker Double Attack OTK  If you can summon Splash Mage + another Cyberse monster, then you can use Splash Mage's effect to revive a monster from the graveyard. From there, you can link the revived monster and your other Cyberse monster on the field for Update Jammer. Link Update Jammer and Splash Mage for Accesscode Talker. Doing this will enable Accesscode Talker to attack twice for an OTK. This is the most resource efficient OTK, but should only be done as a last resort if combo 2B fails or cannot be done.  <span><strong>-Notes</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Space Insulator is used as generic Cyberse Link in order to get rid of things like Nibiru, Nibiru Tokens, and Lost World Tokens off of your field. This is because @Ignister AILand's effect cannot activate as long such cards are in your Main Monster Zone.  </span></li>  	<li>Update Jammer's board effect doesn't reduce The Arrival's attack to 0, so you can use these two together to beat over an unusually high attack power monster. However, this is a really rare scenario.</li> </ol>"

It's a good engine for link summoning since most the time you don't need to search out a Ki-sikil or Lil-la (as they can special summon each other from the deck, aside from Treat and Frost).  The idea for this deck is to get as many materials on the field as possible and have enough to special summon their Evil★Twin link monsters. Both Evil★Twin links summon the other from the graveyard, so if one is taken out, you can immediately special summon the other from the graveyard and get effects based on which was special summoned that way. I will not be covering any staples in the deck (Maxx ""C"", Ash Blossom, Nibiru, Triple Tactics, Effect Veiler, etc.). This deck is a bit tricky to play, you have to bait your opponent out (which you should mostly always be doing) in order to make them use their effects and/or to see what they have (in this case, hand traps). Although it's not the end of the world if you Ki-sikil or Lil-la's searcher effect is negated, it does stop you from having another body on the field.  <strong>Monsters:</strong>  <strong>Live☆Twin Ki-sikil / Lil-La</strong> - These 2 are the main searchers in the deck, you'll always want at least one of these in the hand, as when one is normal or special summoned while you have no monsters on the field, you can special summon their twin counterpart (if you normal summon Lil-la, you'll get Si-sikil and vice versa). Their life burn and gain effects are mostly secondary as you won't really have these on the field most of the time outside of when you need to link summon.  <strong>Live☆Twin Treat / Frost</strong> - If you have a Lil-la or Ki-sikil on the field, you can special summon them based on which of the twins are on the field (Ex: if you have a Ki-sikil, you'll summon a Treat). These are the ideal targets for being sent to the GY as either link material or for a discard (Ex: using Live☆Twin Home), and they both have GY effects. Frost banishes itself when your opponent draws a card, you draw a card. Treat banishes itself when someone takes damage involving a Evil★Twin monster  <strong>Evil★Twins Ki-sikil and Lil-la</strong> - The main boss (aside from Sunny, which is not in at the moment), her main destructive effect can be pretty great at breaking boards (she makes it so your opponent has to send every card they control to the GY, until they have just 2). Although that effect isn't bad, the main point of her is to either be a discard (since she can special summon herself from the GY by using 2 link monsters) and to be a big beatstick (if you have a Ki-sikil or Lil-la in your GY (which you almost always will), she gains 2200 ATK and DEF, making her 4400 ATK/DEF).  <strong>Honest / Dark Honest</strong> - You can swap these out for something else, but for the most part, these cards can win you the game depending on how they're used. Best used if you have a Treat in the GY, so when they swing into you, you can use either Honest, banish Treat, and then decrease the attack of 1 other monster by that amount. You can swap the Dark Honest for Honest, but this deck is primarily dark monsters so that's what I put in.  <strong>Spells:</strong>  <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> - I know this is a staple, but it works extremely well in this deck, especially since neither Evil★Twin or Live☆Twin has any real attack power, outside of Evil★Twin's boss monster. Negating effects and halving the enemies attack power is great, especially if you have a Lil-la Treat in the GY and can swing over enemies (it can also stop spells/traps making it a pretty vital card in a deck with little-to-no negating effects).  <strong>Secret Password</strong> - The 2nd main searcher for the deck, this searches out for either twins spells and traps (or if you have a Ki-sikil and Lil-la on the field, you can add the Evil★Twin boss monster to your hand. This will be your main ""bait"" card, mainly for Ash Blossom, as most of the time you'll have either a Ki-sikil or Lil-la (or more) in hand. Ideally you'll search out a Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch (which I'll explain below).  <strong>Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch</strong> - The main searcher for the deck, it allows you to search for one Live☆Twin monster (you can choose what to add to your hand depending on what you have in-hand. If you want reassurance on the next turn, you can always search out a Lil-la or Ki-sikil, though if you want more link materials on board, you can search out a Frost or Treat (which if you plan on linking, is a good idea).  <strong>Live☆Twin Home</strong> - Home is a decent card for the most part, but it depends on what you have in-hand, I only put it at 1 because it's searchable with 'Secret Password' and because it's usually not needed as most of the time you'll have ways to special summon the twins. This can come in clutch if you really need it to, though, so I'd recommend at least having it. Sending 'Evil★Twins Ki-sikil and Lil-la' to the GY with it's effect is the best case scenario (but don't count on it unless you plan on drawing it or plan on searching it with no interruptions).  <strong>Extra deck:</strong>  <strong>Evil★Twin Ki-sikil</strong> - You'll be seeing this and Lil-la's link monster quite a lot, as with one you get the other. Ideally if you're going first, this is the first card you link into, because whichever of the twins you link into first, will be the one that's last on the field, and whose effect will activate. When she's special summoned and you have a Lil-la monster on the field, you can draw one card (usually that'll be her link counterpart). If you have don't have a Lil-la on the field,  you can special summon one Lil-la from the GY.  <strong>Evil★Twin Lil-la</strong> - Lil-la is the same as 'Evil★Twin Ki-sikil', except for a few things; if you have a Ki-sikil on the field, you can destroy 1 card on the field (this does target), and if you don't have a Ki-sikil on the field, you can special summon one from the GY.  <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> - She's mainly here as support for any link monster, as she has a quick effect that says you can link using materials you control during your opponent's main phase 1, and when she's used as link material, the monster that was link summoned can't be destroyed by card effects.  <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> - A great staple for any link deck, when he's link summoned, you can target 1 link monster in your GY and gain attack equal to that link's rating x 1000. He also has the effect of banishing 1 link from your graveyard to destroy 1 card on the field, which is not once per turn.  <strong>Link Disciple / Link Devotee</strong> - I put these together because they're a great pair and because they're cheap. Link summon Disciple and then Devotee underneath, tribute Devotee, you'll then be able to draw 1 card (in which you'll have to put 1 card on the bottom of the deck), and you'll gain 2 Cyberse link materials. Since you won't be able to link into Link-3 or higher for the rest of the turn, if you have a Lil-la or Ki-sikil on board, you can go into their link monsters. You can also go into I:P Masquerena using the two tokens and then into a link-3+ monster next turn (preferably Excode Talker since your twins can also gain ATK and protection), gaining destruction protection.  <strong>Knightmare Links</strong> - I'm grouping all 3 together just for simplicity, they all have pretty self-explanatory effects. To simplify, Phoenix can pop 1 trap/spell on the field, Unicorn can shuffle 1 card on field back into the deck (this targets), and Gryphon can set 1 spell or trap from your GY. They all have effects based on if they're co-linked or not.  <strong>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</strong> - She has many uses, the main use being able to use 1 monster your opponent controls as materials (bonus points if they're a link monster), she's unaffected by cards, unless they target (so 'Forbidden Droplet', which targets, will not effect her), and she can negate any effect that lets your opponent special summon from the GY, once per turn.  <strong>Transcode Talker </strong>- Transcode is an amazing card in this deck, not only does it provide protection to co-linked monsters and give them a +500 ATK boost, but it can also special summon one Link-3 or lower Cyberse monster from your GY (which most likely would be I:P).  <strong>Side-deck:</strong>  You can tech many things in here if you want, such as 'Royal Decree' (which negates all traps on the field) which would work since this deck doesn't really play any traps (aside from Imperm). These are the main ones for me:  <strong>Parallel eXceed</strong> - This is a great option for really any link deck, you can put in 2 or 3 (3 if you want to draw it more) so you basically have 2 free link materials. When you link summon, and eXceed is in your hands, you can special summon it and another (from hand or deck) to the field where the link monster points to.  <strong>Royal Decree -</strong> Royal Decree is a decent option for this deck, as it runs only 2 traps, though do note that it's pretty easy to get off the field since we don't have much of any protection.  <strong>Tri-Gate Wizard</strong> - This link monster is pretty easy to get on the field (even moreso with 'Parallel eXceed') and gains effects based on how many cards are co-linked with it. It can be pretty easy to get on the field and make annoying to get off (with I:P and 'Transcode Talker')  <strong>Main weaknesses:</strong>  This archetype doesn't have much of any protection by itself, whether that's negation effects or attack power, so it will have to rely heavily on your other link monsters. By itself, the main idea for the links is to take the damage (or if you used the field spell, which you shouldn't, to negate the attack) and use the effects from the destroyed twins to make sure you last. This deck is very weak to things like 'Necrovalley' (but it does have outs, like 'Feather Duster' and 'Knightmare' links), as they rely heavily on their GY. If your opponent knows your deck, then stopping you can become pretty easy early on (you'll still want to bait anyone out using cards how you see fit). This deck also can have trouble with banishment, though it's still a decent engine to link into other monsters.  <strong>Getting Started:</strong>  This deck has many, many combos, and many ways to play, but for the most part, you'll start off with summoning your twins (mainly Ki-sikil and Lil-la, not their Treat or Frost versions) and linking into their links. Whichever link you start with first (unless you have one on the field) you'll end on, so if you link to 'Evil★Twin Ki-sikil', you'll end on 'Evil★Twin Ki-sikil' (which is great for going first, since you get to draw a card).  This deck has a <strong>lot</strong> of drawing power, you can make use of that by baiting some of your opponents with excess cards (or keeping them in hand, up to you), it can make playing a lot smoother. Some of the links (namely 'Devotee' and 'Disciple') make linking that much easier, so you can get out not only your twin links, but a Link-3 (by using I:P next turn) to go into something like 'Tri-Gate Wizard' or 'Transcode Talker' (which can also special summon a Link-3 from the GY). Having access to lots of Link materials means you can also use something like 'Underworld Goddess' to help clear any boss monsters they may have that you can't remove or swing over."

Presenting, Eldlich Shiranui.  First things first, this is not exactly a meta build, but I gotta say that I'm <strong>REALLY</strong> impressed on how budget this deck can be built. Playing through the solo mode and finishing the Shiranui portion of it unlocks an almost finished Shiranui core alongside the Secret Pack ""Fires of This World and The Next"", which allows you to potentially craft the remaining Shiranui monsters and two of the best Zombie support monsters, <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a> and <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>. The only mandatory UR in this build is at least one copy of both <a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a> as your main boss monster, <a data-name=""Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy"">Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy</a>, and <a data-name=""Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi"">Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi</a>, your alternate win condition who's also a semi-floodgate. All of the SR Shiranui monsters are already unlocked for free upon completion, and the Eldlich core can easily be obtainable as well in the Secret Pack ""Immortal Royalty"" which allows you to also potentially pull <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>. <a data-name=""Book of Life"">Book of Life</a> being just a Rare card as well as Plaguespreader Zombie being a Normal card only actually surprised me in a good way. Other Zombie-type monster supports such as <a data-name=""Revived King Ha Des"">Revived King Ha Des</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Archfiend Zombie-Skull"">Archfiend Zombie-Skull</a> are also either Rare or Normal only. <a data-name=""Avendread Savior"">Avendread Savior</a> is not exactly mandatory, but it would also be nice to have as a Link 2 for Zombie decks.  So yeah, a pretty straightforward list this time and not much crazy or spicy techs. Just an almost free deck to play, I'd say that you can mess around and have fun with."

The other powerful monsters and spell/traps like Erebus, Ehther, Kuraz ,Stormforth and Escalation are for controlling the field. Kuraz is also a great draw power.  The draw power's of the deck are : Pantheism (one of the best searchers also), Kuraz and Reload .  And the last but not least are the searchers : Tenacity, Return (pop it with Kuraz for + 2), Pantheism and Goods (when you send pantheism)  This build doesn't play playset Edea and Eidos (they can be easily negated), Anchamoufrite can be very problematic with your strategy, because he can be stucked in Extra and that will nullify your Domain. Proof of Pruflas also can prevent your Ehther to resolve her effect. Your best solutions to play in their places are : 3x Vishuda (synergy with Prime Monarch) or 3x Linkslayer (Twin Twisters on legs). For tribute fathers my scheme is : 1x Edea, 1x Eidos, 3x Mithra , 3x Linkslayer and of course 1x The Prime Monarch. I find it as perfectly balanced.  Foolish Burial is mostly for Erebus and Edea. Erebus is for the Monster Reincarnation effect and Edea is for Monarch spell/trap recovery.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Ohm is a stronger Cannon Soldier in this deck and is probably the most underrated card in the game.  This ftk is disturbingly consistent and almost 100% without removal. From my experience, it has about an 85% rate to ftk when your opponent opens with a handtrap that negates monster effects but it is easy to bait out if you go into xyz monsters with the Dangers!.  I also added only 1 Dark Room of Nightmare in the main and 2 in the side deck because you can get to it very easily but not always but is also kind of a win more card and doesn't always matter  Give this deck a fair chance and you will get a lot of wins."

Nothing will go wrong, right?""               -Ronald Reagan probably","Well, Thunder Dragon Colossus is limited on the banlist, so Thunder Dragons suddenly became more than just a rogue strategy.  Anyways, this is a Thunder Dragon Chaos deck. We're playing to turbo out Colossus and hopefully Titan on your first turn of play (which is surprisingly easy!)  Our Thunder Dragon lineup is 3 of the OG, 3 Dragondark, 3 Dragonmatrix, 2 Dragon Fusion, 2 Dragonroar, 1 Dragonhawk, and 1 Dragonduo. The newest Main Deck Thunder Dragons gain bonus effects when banished or sent from the field to the graveyard, like special summon a TD monster from the deck, tutor for a TD card (not monster, any card. Hooray for TD Fusion tutor!), getting another copy of the same card, etc. This is why we're also running a small Chaos package!  Our Chaos lineup is pretty brief; 3 Chaos Space, 1 Chaos Creator, 1 Wyverburster, 1 Collapserpent, and the Dragonduo from the TD lineup. We run these to banish TD monsters for value, and in the case with Dragonduo and Chaos Creator being Thunder-type monsters that are special summons from banishing, we can tribute them to cheat Colossus from the Extra Deck.  We include 2 monsters that aren't a part of these packages, but they banish so they're damn good. Batteryman Solar is a Thunder monster that allows you to banish a Thunder monster from the deck, and Aloof Lupine serves the same purpose as long as we banish a Thunder monster from our hand. Cheating TD monster effects from straight from the Main Deck is pretty bonkers.  I included 3 different Hand Traps into the deck; 3 Effect Veiler, 3 Maxx ""C"" and 2 Called by the Grave. These can honestly be anything. Just prepare for what you're primarily playing against to tech against that matchup. Drytrons? Droll and Lock Bird fucks with their turn massively.  Our spell lineup now, excluding ones previously mentioned. 1 Feather Duster, 1 Gold Sarc, 1 Instant Fusion, and 3 Allure of Darkness. Feather Duster ruins backrow decks like Eldlich, Generaider, and a good Monarch start. The Gold Sarc is an immediate effect activation for a TD monster of our choice, and the 3 Allure of Darkness is for draw power while fueling effects from our TD monsters with its banish clause.  Now the spicy shit: the Extra Deck! Most of the Extra Deck is generic and you can swap most of it out with your personal preferences.  We got 1 Colossus, 3 Titan, 1 Kaminari Attack, 1 Abyss Dweller, 1 Summer Summoner, 1 Masquerena, 1 Verte, 1 Phoenix, 1 Unicorn, 1 Apollousa, and 1 Accesscode.  Trust me when I say that all you really need in your extra deck is the Colossus, Kaminari Attack, and 2 Titans and not 3. Colossus, if you didn't know, floodgates ONLY your opponent from not being allowed to search cards from their deck. Note that they can still DRAW cards and send cards to the graveyard. Kaminari Attack is our Instant Fusion target, being a Thunder Fusion monster allows it to be tributed for either Colossus and Titan. Titan has a quick effect pop when a Thunder monster activates their effect from your hand. Please note that on nowhere on that card mentions ""Once per turn"". Oh yeah, and they have protection from destruction. With Colossus, you gotta banish a Thunder monster (More effects? Hell yeah!) and Titan allows you to banish and 2 cards from your graveyard, doesn't have to be just a Thunder monster.  And that's Thunder Dragons for ya! Have fun summoning Colossus and Titan turn 1 and your opponent not being able to do anything!  &nbsp;"

Targets for banishing (most of the time): 1 mechaba, purgatrio, augoeidis, predaplant verde, framelord omega, Construct, fossil warrior.  Some of u will wondering why i play 2 ash and 2 droll, the reason is simple, i love these cards and i know they are the best hand traps in the current meta but if i have 2 ash in hand then one becomes brick and can't be used the same turn, same goes for droll, hand traps that can be used once per turn i playing x2 in main and if is devastating against some decks i have the third copy in side.  The side deck is build for the current meta, i didn't put any spell/trap removals, however, going first solemn judgment can respond. If u want u can replace droplet with lightning storm or spell/trap removal or board breaker.  in the main is 12 hand traps, 85% chance to open going first and 92% going second, if u want to change something feel free to do it but make sure to have at least 7-8 monster hand traps that can be appropiate targets for Small World and are compatible for almiraj (because of Maximus combo). The players which want 3 ash blosom feel free to do it but don't remove ghost ogre, u need at least 1.  SMALL WORLD: How small world works in this deck? Some of u maybe never played this card so i will explain. Banish 1 monster from your hand. To add Aleister in hand: reveal from the deck 1 of these: Ash, Veiller, Maximus, Droll, Ghost ogre To add dogmatika in hand: reveal from the deck 1 of these: Ghost ogre, droll, Aleister  About Maximus: Everyone using 1 copy of maximus (me also in the past) but that's wrong, Maximus x3 is the best. Normal summon whatever monster (even hand trap), summon almiraj - gardna - sp summon maximus - send in gy apcalone and ash dragon - set schism for winda - sp summon ecclesia in EP by ash dragon and add fleur in your hand. I mention that combo because the most of the people thinks Maximus is brick or bad draw, but is not. It's both starter and extender.  BUDGET VERSION: Remove 3 pot of prosperity. This is very strong card, going first it can give u access in total of 11 cards in 40 card deck, i consider pot of prosperity both starter and card for consistency, u can't replace it with upstart goblin or pot of desire, absurd, no chance. Add 1-3 mystic mine in the place of pot of prosperity, the reason is simple, if u don't have starter in your hand u can lock and stop your opponent from playing until u draw meltdown, u have 4 meltdown in main so u will be fine, this is your best option if u don't play pot of prosperity in this deck. Remove Droplet also. I don't recommend removing the destiny fusion package because if aleister and dogmatika is negated then u can summon predaplant verte and summon enforcer, basically after 2 negates u still can play, so really i don't recommend removing it, if u want u can replace it with dragoon package, 1 fusion, 1 dark magician and 1 red eyes... total of 3 cards, still is 100 dolars but enforcer or dragoon is worth it, u can target impermanence for replacement, this will save u the money for enforcer or dragoon. if u choice the dragoon package and u have 1-2 card free space, u can add Angel Statue - Azurune, it's good and is combaining well with all your engines."

This deck was a versatile Anti-Meta Beatdown deck, which is described as a Beatdown deck that utilizes different control tools. This deck utilized the monster Elemental HERO Neos Alius in tandem with the card Gemini Spark to act as removal. Combining these with the card Skill Drain, allowed you to play a slower Beatdown strategy by stopping all monster effects on the field. This deck didn't utilize many monster card effects to ensure its win, so it could get away with and play around a floodgate like Skill Drain.  Neos Alius is your primary monster to beat down the opponent with, its 1900 ATK body was very capable of punching over most normal summoned monsters, while this together with Gemini Spark can help clear the opponent's board, the other important factor is that it's an Elemental HERO, meaning that it was capable of being used as fusion material for a generic line of Elemental HERO fusion monsters. With Miracle Fusion, you can use monsters on your field and/or in your grave yard as material for a fusion summon of an Elemental HERO fusion monster.  The Extra Deck acts sort of as a tool box, allowing you to get out monsters that you need for certain situations. In most cases, the deck would use Neos Alius with either Penguin Soldier or Snowman Eater to make Elemental HERO Absolute Zero. Absolute Zero while on top of having a fairly decent ATK of 2500, it also has an effect that destroys all of your opponent's monsters when removed from the field. Because Absolute Zero's effect activates after it leaves the field, it will still work even with Skill Drain active on the field, because Absolute Zero is no longer on the field, it is no longer negated by Skill Drain. Elemental HERO The Shining is a really good card to beat over larger monsters on your opponent's field. By using the Miracle Fusion to summon it, you will have banished at least 1 Elemental HERO monster, so it at the least be summoned out with 2900 ATK. On top of this, it also has an effect when sent from the field to the grave yard that lets you add up to 2 banished Elemental HEROs to your hand, allowing you to recycle the material used to summon it. Elemental HERO Great Tornado is a fairly strong monster, halving the ATK and DEF of all face-up monsters your opponent controls, on top of having 2800 ATK points, it was able to punch over practically any monster. Elemental HERO Nova Master is a decent card, having 2600 ATK on top of also letting you draw a card when it destroyed a monster is a good recovery option for the deck, being able to be made from the Wind-Up Zenmaines and one of your Elemenal HEROs. Elemental HERO Gaia is just another option to go into to beat over large monsters, being able to siphon half the attack out of a monster lets you punch in for a considerable amount of damage. That's as far as it goes with the Elemental HERO line-up for the Extra Deck. The Elemental HERO fusions are essentially your primary tools to use to deal adequate damage and combat stronger monsters. On top of all of this as well, the deck utilizes Super Polymerization, so you're able to use your opponent's monsters to fuse as well, so it makes for a really good removal tool.  From here I'll go over certain key cards in the deck. Elemental HERO Stratos will either act as a tool to remove your opponent's Spells and Traps, or it can be used to search out your Neos Alius to play on the follow-up turn. Stratos on top of E - Emergency Call, as well as 1 Reinforcement of the Army, allows you to effectively play 7 copies of your Neos Alius, which helps keep the deck really consistent.  You Play Pot of Duality for this reason, your deck isn't going to be doing a lot of special summoning all the time. Pot of Duality lets you dig into your deck for your turn. Whether that be drawing a Gemini Spark, a Neos Alius, or even one of your Trap cards, Pot of Duality lets you get the cards that will get your strategy online.  Thunder King Rai-Oh stops the opponent from searching for cards in their deck, and it can also negate a single special summon. This is a pretty decent card to normal summon, as its 1900 ATK points can be hard to hit over in a good amount of circumstances.  Crusader of Endymion is played mostly because it's another Gemini monster with a comparable 1900 ATK points. It doesn't enable your fusions like Neos Alius, but it does give your more consistency in getting your Gemini Spark online.  Beast King Barbaros can be normal summoned, but its attack is changed to 1900, this card works well with Skill Drain, as Skill Drain with negate its effect, and it will return to its original 3000 ATK. This can be utilized in a couple ways. Either by using it as a big monster to clear the opponent's field, or to possibly have your opponent attack into it, and then activate the Skill Drain so Barbaros could potential destroy that monster.  As mentioned above, Gemini Spark acts as a control tool for the deck, allowing you to turn your Neos Alius and your Crusader of Endymion into removal options, and then Gemini Spark lets you draw a card. Combined with the card Hero Blast, Gemini Spark became much more powerful, allowing you tribute the Neos Alius to destroy a card on the field, and then Hero Blast would let you bring back the Neos Alius to your hand and destroy a monster on the field. This is a very power card combination that acts as the primary control tools for the deck, as it can easily remove valuable cards from your opponent's field.  I hope you enjoy this little piece of Yu-Gi-Oh!'s history. This deck is really fun, and I hope you guys will think so too."

You'll still Winning along the road though.,"Dinomorphia had Won almost every games against The Grinding Golden Lord, But in the New Format of Feb 2022, 3 Skill Drains are gonna be helping Eldlich for sure.  Inspired by a tournament top deck and to prepare for the new format, this is a quite competitive version of the Cyber Dinosaur Cosplayers and Robots Legion.  Some points: <ul>  	<li>Less NS, more Traps, more Responses to the opponent's actions. It's amazing that it actually works. Cause all we need is a Trap to start the game.</li>  	<li>Gravedigger Trap Hole and Debunk are for things like Eldlich and Ash.</li>  	<li>Ash was added for more interaction if having to go second first round and...</li>  	<li>Ash tutors RexSturm into Psy End Punisher, is one of very few boss can get over Rex. So We addopted them.</li>  	<li>3 Ferret Flame. These are our Speciality. That can Handle even Those Psy End Punisher- aliked bosses. It makes Player shuffle their monsters into the deck. therefore Effect-immuned Monsters can do nothing but making a good fly.</li>  	<li>3 Brute. For Those who can attack directly, like the little Rank 1 birds. Also it's usually a plus 1 bringing back Theriza.</li>  	<li>2 Torrential Tribute. to Clear field. good against combo decks like @Ignister or Virtual World. Because our monsters all float.</li>  	<li>Imprudent Intrusion.  testing this one. kind of a flexible card, it can kill 1 or bring back 1. base on the different of LP. it can bring back the big ones too.</li>  	<li>I feel safer knowing there are 2 Alert in the deck.</li>  	<li>Same with 2 Sonic and 1 Reversion. Totally Helpful to Dodge an Attack to the LP.</li>  	<li>In Side deck:  I think ablout Floowandereeze, Those Decks can apply Super Poly, and Of Course, Eldlich.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Yuto was still trashtalking a lot while losing his game last time we met. Poor him.  I think I should point this out. Yugioh isn't as noble as Chess, even in Chess there are Hustlers who trashtalking while playing but it's not cool. At all.  So Be Cool.

The game-plan is to essentially draw your whole deck on one turn and win with Exodia. For newer or returning players, I'll lay out the function of the Numeron Engine.  Your Numeron engine includes the cards Numeron Wall, Numeron Network, Numeron Calling, and your Number Gate monsters. You want to use Numeron Wall to activate Numeron Network directly from the deck. You use the Numeron Network effect to activate Numeron Calling, which will summon your 4 Number Gate monsters from the Extra Deck. At this point, if you have Memories of Hope in your hand, you can use it to Draw 4 cards.

Not too long ago, they got legacy support with more spell cards, trap cards, a field spell, and a new set of ""Mega Monarchs"": Level 8 Monarchs that can be tribute summoned using a tribute summoned monster to get an effect stronger than their predecessors.  Lets start with our Normal summons: 3 Edea the Heavenly Squire, 3 Eidos the Underworld Squire, and 2 Proof of Pruflas. Edea is a Level 1 monster that pulls another monster with 800 ATK and 1000 DEF from your deck. Eidos, is a Level 2 monster with 800 ATK/1000 DEF that allows you to immediately tribute summon a monster from hand when its summoned, doesn't matter if you normal or special summoned it. And then their Proof of Pruflas, a Level 3 special summon as long as you don't control a special summoned monster yourself. You can also immediately tribute summon a monster when its summoned, for an easy Monarch or Fiend!  Now our Tribute summons! These are the reason why we play the deck in the first place. We got 3 Erebus the Underworld Monarch, 3 Ehther the Heavenly Monarch, 1 Thestalos the Mega Monarch, 1 Kuraz the Light Monarch, and 2 Majesty's Fiend. Erebus and Ehther both send 2 Monarch Spell/Traps to activate their respective effects. Erebus sends any 1 card your opponent controls back into their deck. Can be from the field or GY. Ehther allows you to special summon a Monarch or Fiend from your deck, but you gotta return it to your hand in the end phase. Thestalos allows you to send a card from your opponent's hand to the GY, and you deal burn damage if the card sent was a monster and its based on its level. Kuraz pops up to any 2 cards on the field and then players draw 1 card for each card they control got popped by this effect. Note that Kuraz is one of the only Monarchs that can activate their effect on a special summon as well, but can't attack the turn its summoned. And then we got Majesty's Fiend, a Level 6 monster that can't be special summoned and prevents both players from activating their monsters' effects. It is without a doubt one of the best single tribute card you can throw in this deck. I previously had Vanity's Fiend in the deck, but Majesty's basically does the same thing.  Our spell and trap lineup now! These are what keeps the deck churning. We got 1 Foolish Burial, 1 Reinforcement of the Army, 1 One for One, 3 Tenacity of the Monarchs, 3 Pantheism of the Monarchs, 3 The Monarchs Stormforth, 3 Domain of the True Monarchs, 2 March of the Monarchs, 2 Return of the Monarchs, 1 Frost Blast of the Monarchs, and 2 The Prime Monarch. Foolish Burial, RotA, and One for One are obviously the generically good one-ofs that literally serve the purpose of either putting a Monarch or Monarch spell/trap into the GY for their GY effect or to Put Edei either on the field or into your hand, therefore starting your chain. Tenacity of the Monarchs is a Monarch spell/trap search as long as you have a Monarch in your hand to reveal. This card is a reason why we aren't running Terraforming for the field spell. Pantheism is a Pot of Greed as long as you have a Monarch spell/trap to discard and has a GY effect to reveal 3 Monarch spell/traps from your hand and your opponent selects one to add to your hand (Woo, another way to grab the field spell!) Monarchs Stormforth is a Quick-Play that allows you to tribute an opponent's monster for your Monarchs. Domain of the True Monarchs is our field spell and big payoff for playing the deck. It allows your Mega Monarchs (the Level 8 ones) to have their level lowered by 2, so they can be tribute summoned with a single monster! Anyways, the main effect we care about is if we are the only ones that control a tribute summoned monster and we don't have an extra deck, our opponent can't summon monsters from the extra deck. That is by far the strongest card in our deck that isn't Majesty's Fiend. March of the Monarchs prevents our tribute summoned monsters from being targeted and destroyed by card effects. Note that it doesn't mention Monarchs, it mentions tribute summoned monsters, so it gives protection to Majesty's as well! Return of the Monarchs is a search for a monster with 2400 ATK/1000 DEF or  2800 ATK/1000 DEF if you tribute summon a monster. Also note that Majesty's Fiend is 2400 ATK/1000 DEF so it can be searched with this card too! Frost Blast of the Monarchs is a pop for a set card on the field if we control any Monarch or Fiend, and has the GY effect to banish itself and another Monarch spell/trap to pop another set card. The Prime Monarch is a continuous trap that allows us to shuffle 2 Monarch spell/traps from the GY back into your deck and draw 1 card after. While its in the GY, you can banish another Monarch spell/trap to summon it as a Level 5 monster. More tribute fodder always helps the deck!  That's it for the deck honestly! You can put in any hand traps you might need or put in other Monarch spell/traps, like the one that allows you to tribute summon once during your opponent's turn. This deck is a little heavy on the SRs and URs, but it makes up for it by not needing to run an extra deck. Have fun not allowing your opponent to play turn 1!"

Today we have a deck focused around 'Fallen of Albaz'.  The deck is a bit clunky, and still needs some kinks hammered out, but the deck does function quite nicely in testing. The entire objective of the deck is to swarm the field with your 'Albaz' fusion monsters, and then swing for big numbers. Many of the cards in the deck do have negate power, and including 'Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon' just ups that amount.  The main cards to focus on in the deck are - Fallen of Albaz, Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous, Branded in White, and Branded Fusion.  The deck can be fixed up and tossed around by splashing a Chaos engine or Swordsouls into it."

History,"HAT, stands for Hand Artifact Traptrix. This deck was a wildly successful deck in the 2014 format and it dominated a lot of the top competition, so much so that the format would later come to be known as HAT Format. The deck, HAT, is broken down into 3 parts.  Hand, Fire Hand, and Ice Hand. Fire Hand is a 1600 ATK monster with an effect that allows you to destroy a face-up monster when its destroyed by your opponent's card, and then it lets you special summon an Ice Hand from the deck. Ice Hand's effect allows you to destroy a face-up Spell or Trap your opponent controls when it is destroyed by your opponent's card, and then it allows you to special summon a Fire Hand from the deck. The Hands in the deck allows the player to have a consistent way to break down the opponent's board, effectively punishing them for controlling a face-up monster on your turn. As neither of these effects have a once per turn restriction, you could use them over and over until you've wiped your opponent's field.  The next section is the Artifact lineup. The Artifacts are a series of monster cards that can be set in the Spell and Trap card zones, and they special summon themselves from the GraveYard when destroyed as well as apply an effect to give you additional advantage. In the case of HAT, the Artifacts that would be ran are Artifact Beagalltach, Artifact Moralltach, and the trap card, Artifact Sanctum. Artifact Beagalltach was used in the more combo oriented version of the deck, the control versions much like this one would just run the Moralltach and the Sanctums. Starting off with Artifact Moralltach, its effect allows you to summon it from your GraveYard when it is destroyed in your Spell and Trap card zone. If Moralltach was summoned on your opponent's turn, it allows you to destroy one face up card they control. Beagalltach's effect allows you to destroy a card in your Spell and Trap card zone when its summoned, this allows you to destroy your Moralltach and get it back as a monster to easily make the Rank 5 XYZ monster, Artifact Durendal. Artifact Sanctum's effect lets you summon an Artifact monster from your deck. Between the 3 copies of Artifact Sanctum, and the 3 copies of Artifact Moralltach, you are effectively playing 6 copies of Moralltach, which allowed the deck to maintain a lot of consistency.  Finally, the Traptrix. Traptrix are a series of cards that have different effects that revolve around the Hole trap cards, such as Trap Hole, Bottomless Trap Hole and so on. HAT would run 2 of the Traptrix, that being Traptrix Dionaea, and Traptrix Myrmeleo. Dionaea when normal summoned allows you to add a Hole trap card from your deck to your hand, but when it's special summoned, it allows you to destroy a Spell or Trap card your opponent controls. Myrmeleo when Normal Summoned allows you to Special Summon a Traptrix monster from the GraveYard in defense position, but when Myrmeleo is Special Summoned, it allows you to set a Hole trap card from your GraveYard, but it banishes it if it's still on the field during the end phase of your next turn. Traptrix monsters themselves are also unaffected by the effect of Hole trap cards, that makes them a pretty reliable Normal Summon, as they also have a decent amount of ATK points."

The deck has a lot of power behind it that allows it to summon out monsters like Evolzar Dolkka and Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, two really powerful monsters that can help secure you games. With the monster Miscellaneousaurus, you can add protection to your dinosaurs that will let you safely make your plays and go into your big boss monsters. Miscellaneousaurus can also be used on your opponent's turn to act as protection from their destruction effects or negations on their turn to ensure your monsters have more staying power. There are a couple of different combo lines in the deck I will go over <br /><br /><em>Summon Souleating Oviraptor &gt; Effect To Search &gt; Search Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus In The GY &gt; Summon Animadorned Archosaur &gt; Animadorned Archosaur Effect Destroy A Dinosaur &gt; Add Double Evolution Pill. Optimally, you want to destroy either Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon with the effect of Animadorned Archosaur so you can get an additional summon out of them. This is your primary Dinosaur combo line that can enable your plays into your Evolzar XYZ monsters, it can also allow you to summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. You also have your Scrap combo lines. Your Scrap combos can let you go into the Synchro monsters in the Extra Deck by using Scrap Raptor as the tuner material. Your average Scrap combo will look like this. Summon Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Raptor Effect Activate &gt; Destroy The Same Scrap Raptor &gt; Add Scrap Chimera From Deck &gt; Summon Scrap Chimera &gt; Revive Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Raptor + Scrap Chimera To Make Scrap Wyvern &gt; Scrap Wyvern Revive Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Wyvern Effect Destroy Scrap Raptor &gt; Summon Scrap Raptor From Deck. </em></p><p>At this point the Scrap Wyvern's effect will resolve by destroying a card on the field. You have a couple options here depending on your established board. If you have a Babycerasaurus or a Petiteranodon you want to destroy those to get another dino on the field with their effect, if you control Lost World while your opponent has a token, you want to target the token for destruction, activate Lost World and then destroy either a Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon from your deck for an additional dino summon. If you have neither of those, you can either decide to just destroy a card your opponent controls or you can destroy your own Scrap Wyvern and use it to equip to Borreload Savage Dragon to provide yourself two negations, additionally, if you decide to play a generic Rank 4 XYZ monster in the Extra Deck, you can use this line to get you into those fairly easily if Scrap Raptor is your only combo piece.</p><p><em>Summon Scrap Raptor &gt; Scrap Raptor Effect Activate Destroy Itself &gt; Add Scrap Chimera &gt; Summon Scrap Chimera &gt; Revive Scrap Raptor. At this point you have your two level 4 monsters you can turn into a Rank 4 XYZ. Keep in mind if you draw into the Scrap Chimera, you just want to use Scrap Raptor's effect to destroy itself on the field, and then this enables you to summon your Scrap Chimera from your hand, from that point you revive your Scrap Raptor from the Grave Yard. The field spell, Lost World puts a lot of the deck online. Here's a typical Lost World combo line Activate Lost World &gt; Summon Souleating Oviraptor &gt; Souleating Oviraptor Effect Add Miscellaneousaurus &gt; Activate Miscellaneousaurus In Hand &gt; Activate Souleating Oviraptor's Second Effect &gt; Target The Token For Destruction &gt; Activate Lost World &gt; Destroy A Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon From The Deck &gt; Summon Dinosaur. </em></p><p>Outside of this, Lost World offers you protection and acts as a mild floodgate, as its effect will make it so the opponent can only target tokens with card effects. You have a couple different ways of activating the destruction replacement effect of Lost World such as the Scrap combo listed above. There's some parts of the deck I haven't really gone over, and I might possibly update this to include more information. I hope this description of this deck was helpful to newer/returning players, or anyone generally interested in this deck.</p>"

This deck excels at shutting your opponent out of spell cards with Secrest Village of Spellcasters, Dragoon, Dark Paladin, and The Dark Magicians. It also stops your opponents from destroying your monsters with Dragon Knight and Dark Cavalry. It has strong removal with Spellbook of Fate, Hieratic of Prophecy, and Number 11: Big Eye, and Dragoon. It also has a ton of ways to search nearly any card in the deck."

GX era. First introduced were the Elemental HEROs and the Destiny HEROs, and the anime later introduced the Evil HEROs. Later on, the manga introduced the Masked and Vision HEROs. HEROs have been played differently over the years in many different decks. This deck combines the power of all of the HEROs together for a very powerful OTK strategy. The modern HERO deck is a non-linear combo deck, that aims to One-Turn-Kill(OTK) the opponent fairly consistently, but it can also set up a couple different powerful floodgates to slow down your opponent.</p><p>Your main starters of the deck are your Elemental HERO Stratos, Vision HERO Faris and your Vision HERO Vyon. In most cases, Stratos will search you Faris, which will allow you to get into your Vision HERO Combo. Vyon will be the last card summoned on your Vision HERO combo but sometimes it will need to be utilized as a starter to dump a HERO into the deck like Shadowmist to get a search to get more of your combo pieces, or Malicious to go into Xtra HERO Cross Crusader in a pinch to get your combo pieces.<br /><br />There are a couple different combo lines in the deck I will attempt to line out as best as possible.</p><p><br /><strong>Stratos + Any HERO</strong></p><hr /><p><br /><em>Stratos &gt; Search Faris &gt; Special Summon Faris &gt; Put Increase In Spell/Trap Zone &gt; Activate Increase Sending Faris To GY &gt; Summon Increase &gt; Summon Vyon &gt; Vyon Effect Send Malicious To GY &gt; Vyon Effect Banish A HERO Other Than Malicious to Add Polymerization.</em> <em>Summon Cross Crusader &gt; Cross Crusader Effect Revive Malicious &gt; Cross Crusader Effect #2 Send Malicious To GY And Search &gt; Add Liquid Soldier To Hand</em> <em>Activate Polymerization &gt; Use Stratos + Liquid Soldier To Make Elemental HERO Sunrise &gt; Liquid Soldier Effect to Draw 2 on Chain Link 1 and Sunrise Effect to Add Miracle Fusion From Deck To Hand on Chain Link 2<br /><br /><br /></em> This is a common series of combos for the deck that you'll be able to do fairly consistently to put a lot of powerful monsters on the field, what you end on will be up to you, with Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, you can also use your Cross Crusader to add Destiny HERO - Denier to your hand and then use the Denier + Malicious to make Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer with the Polymerization There are other combos you can do depending on the different pieces you have in your hand.<br /><br /><strong>Fusion Destiny<br /></strong></p><hr /><p><strong><br /></strong><em>Activate Fusion Destiny &gt; Send Destiny HERO - Malicious + Destiny HERO </em><strong>- </strong><em>Denier &gt; Summon Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer.</em> <br />This line is very straight forward, it allows you to produce a Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer on your field while having 3 summons set up in your GY through Malicious and Denier. <em>Fusion Destiny &gt; Send Shadowmist + Malicious To Summon Destiny HERO - Dangerous &gt; Shadowmist Effect &gt; Search Stratos &gt; Stratos Search Faris.<br /></em>Using Fusion Destiny to make Destiny HERO - Dangerous like this allows you to get a search and summon from Shadowmist and Malicious respectively. You can use this to go into your Vision HERO combo as well as the Malicious in the GY puts the effect of Xtra HERO Cross Crusader online. You have a lot of options for what you can search off Shadowmist but if you're trying to start a combo you're going to want to search either a Faris or a Stratos depending on what other cards are in your hand. From the point that you add the Faris you can proceed to go into your Vision HERO combo. Keep in mind however that Fusion destiny locks you into Dark attribute HEROs for the reamainder of the turn.<br /><br />I'll line out a use for the combo that allows you get still summon Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer even though you've used your Fusion Destiny. <em>Faris Effect Discarding a HERO For Cost&nbsp; &gt; Faris Summon &gt; Faris Effect &gt; Place Vision HERO Increase in your Spell/Trap Zone &gt; Increase Effect, Tribute Faris &gt; Summon Increase &gt; Increase Trigger Effect &gt; Summon Vision HERO Vyon &gt; Vision HERO Vyon Trigger Effect &gt; Send Destiny HERO - Denier From Deck to GY &gt; Vision HERO Vyon Ignition Effect &gt; Banish Elemental HERO Shadowmist &gt; Add Polymerization.<br /><br /></em> This line allows you to put the Denier in your GY to summon it with Malicious, allowing you to make Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer using either your Denier + Malicious or your Denier + Dangerous. Alternatively to this, you could just use Dangerous's effect to send your Destiny HERO - Denier and then summon Malicious from your deck to make Cross Crusader out of Dangerous + Malicious, but in either case you want to use the Vision HERO combo to add the Polymerization to fuse into your Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. The deck's optimum 1st turn board consists of summoning Destiny - HERO Plasma and Masked HERO Dark Law. These 2 cards together put a lot of pressure on the opponent because they are extremely powerful floodgates that will slow down their turn, or even outright stop their plays. Mask Change can be searched by Special Summoning Shadowmist, but keep in mind only 1 Shadowmist effect can activate per turn. Mask Change allows you to not only access your Dark Law, but it can also help the deck OTK, or even add a layer of protection for Stratos against targeting negation. You can use the Mask Change to help Stratos avoid being negated by effect negating cards that target such as Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence. When you summon the Stratos and activate its effect to search, if your opponent activates either Infinite Impermanence or Effect Veiler to target your Stratos and negate it, you can use the Mask Change to turn Stratos into Masked HERO Blast, and because Stratos left the field to summon Masked HERO Blast, the Effect Veiler or Infinite Impermanence would lose their target and you'll still be able to get your search with Stratos.<br /><br /></p><hr /><p><br />I've opted to play Super Polymerization in this deck in order to hit a lot of the bigger monsters the opponent will have out this format, such as playing Elemental HERO The Shining as a target to hit cards such as Swordsoul Grandmaster - Chixiao, Eldlich The Golden Lord or Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder. Elemental HERO Great Tornado allows you to hit cards such as Baronne de Fleur, Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen or Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds. Outside of being able to summon it with Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier, you can also summon Elemental HERO Absolute Zero with Super Polymerization to hit cards such as Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying or Adamancipator Risen - Dragite. Elemental HERO Escuridao will mostly find use as being an extender summoned off the Miracle Fusion but with Super Polymerization you can use it to get rid of some cards like and opponent's Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer or Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. With a Destiny HERO monster you can Normal Summon, Super Poly also allows you to use your opponent's Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer to make your own Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, this is really powerful as because their Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer wasn't destroyed, it doesn't get its effect to special summon. There's still some things in this deck I haven't went over. You'll have to play around with it to really get the feel of the non-linear stuff. I hope the description helps you figure out this very familiar strategy.</p>"

Presenting, Branded Beetroopers. Before anything else, I just wanna say that this is not particularly a competitive version of the list, if anything I doubt the two of these decks could ever work harmoniously together (but that's a problem for another day, or list), so this will be more of a deck analysis and discussion regarding my thoughts upon testing it rather than just a regular deck profile, so don't expect anything short especially if you don't find reading particularly enjoyable.  So the story behind this deck list is that an acquaintance of mine from Duelingbook sent me a message containing a link to a video of a Beetrooper gameplay (if you're here I appreciate the gift of thought), which shows a couple of lines that can set up to bring out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> during your opponent's turn with a card for negation in hand with the help of Fusion Parasite, which I assume also means that it also allows you to bring out any Invoked Fusion monster as well provided that you have the correct materials on board. The philosophy behind the merging however is that the Beetrooper portion of the deck can easily bring out Dragoon no problem, but so can the Branded engine, so why not splash the two of them together?  <strong>Chapter I: The Glaring Weaknesses.</strong>  <span>I play and test the Branded/Despia/Albaz strategy a LOT, since during the day it was released because one of my favorite Fusion Spells being the Fusion strategy enjoyer that I am is Super Polymerization, and Fallen of Albaz is just like a walking budget version of that, so I already have an idea on which cards to cut to make it as compact as possible without sacrificing consistency. But during the deck building process I have noticed that the Beetrooper portion of the deck requires a lot of main deck cards and one ofs in order to work ideally. Despite it only drawing soft bricks, you'd still want to draw the main starters. The main problem with this deck is that, the two engines clash with each other. The Branded portion of the deck xeno locks you into Fusion summoning only during that turn, else it cannot be activated, but the Beetroopers require Link summoning in order to start their turn, while the Beetrooper portion of the deck also xeno locks you into only summoning Insect monsters one way or another. I believe that there could've been a line somewhere that could make this relationship possible if one just wasn't as adamant as the other but, the only real way to somehow make it work is to force it. You gotta choose which one to pick as your main set up going first and your follow up going second. Ideally you'd want to start with the Branded portion of the deck first since it's the lesser restrictive of the two, but since we're playing a smaller package, it has to rely strongly on the luck of the draw.</span>  <strong>Chapter II: Sometimes coincidental synergies just ain't enough.</strong>  <span>Often times in your life you will find yourself on certain days stumbling upon things that you'll likely tell yourself that they could possibly fit together perfectly because of how much similarities they have. But things don't just match because of how much alike they are, it could also be because of how they're still able to find common ground despite how different they are to each other, but on the case of the latter, the risks of failing will be much higher. From what I've seen in testing pretty much just half of what the actual Beetroopers can do, I do admit that I am a beginner at piloting the deck since this day is literally the first day I have ever touched this archetype but I do also believe that this deck has a strong potential to grind. In testing, it even reminded me of the EARTH Machines, based on how much they Link climb, send to the GY, banish resources to extend, and recycle after setting up. And from what I already know about Branded Albaz is that it can DEFINITELY grind games without sacrificing board presence, that's why it's the best deck here in the OCG despite the plague of <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and the Adventurer Token. But apart from the glaring weaknesses of this relationship that I have already discussed, there's more. Branded Albaz needs as much coverage as they can get, and merging it with a strategy that needs their Extra Deck as well for starters means that I would have to sacrifice some of those coverage. Beetroopers also face the same problem, because despite having been able to recycle their resources for the next turn, it really doesn't have any much guaranteed follow up anyway. And with these two problems in mind, you'd have to choose a path: It's either the Beetroopers or the Branded Albaz, one has to be the smaller engine and the other should do the grinding.</span>  <strong>Chapter III: No man can serve two masters.</strong>  <span>We've already discussed their differences, and what makes their relationship tough, but we still haven't discussed what brought them together in the first place: <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. You see, this was a bit of an oversight on my part, I should've seen this problem coming. Sure, there are multiple ways of accessing it in this deck but the problem is, you've already got a tight enough Extra Deck space for one, what more for a more? So basically, both Beetroopers and Branded Albaz to an extent is clashing against each other again but this time on which one should bring <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> out. Branded Albaz can do it no problem with absolute ease, the only issue is that it's much more vulnerable to interruptions since it only plays a small amount of Branded cards in the main. Beetroopers can also do it somewhat decently, but a lot of things has to go right, and after that, it has already served its purpose.</span>  So yeah, that's pretty much everything that I have for the deck so far. I'm gonna be honest, I think these two are much better off without each other, considering how much they conflict and restrict one another from working as optimally as possible. It's sad but, maybe in another life where archetypes aren't as xeno locked as it is anymore they could work, but not in this one. Later."

The Megalith component plays a huge role on the strat, with Phul actually recycling Benten from the grave and allowing rank 4 xyz plays.  This deck doesn't include Diviner of the Herald, which could be seen as an insane choice, but since we do not put our focus on synchro summons but powerful xyz instead Diviner isn't needed. We use Manju (searchable with Benten) instead of Diviner for our normal summon, that can add from the deck whatever is needed for the combo to continue (Manju is used most of the times to access your Megalith engine).  The rank 4 xyz (Manju + Ophiel) will often be tornado dragon to force the scythe lock or can be a Dweller (really impactful against certain decks).  The 2 Mu Beta are mandatory, we abuse both for the full combo.  The deck suffers from heavy backrow decks, I suggest playing Twin Twister, Feather, Cosmic and even Quadrantids in side deck.  <strong>Deck features (in my humble opinion)</strong> <ul>  	<li>Cost: 7/10, since we are not playing Diviner, the deck results less expensive (but still relies on the expensive card F0 Utopic Draco Future)</li>  	<li>Consistency: 8/10, we are playing a lot of generic cards that can lead us to the main combo</li>  	<li>Competitivity: 8/10, the deck can outplay and compete against a lot of decks in the meta. The full combo is still insanely strong.</li>  	<li>Fun: 9/10, this deck, compared to the old herald version, is much more fun and lead to multiple options in terms of combos.</li> </ul> <strong>Full board</strong> <ul>  	<li>1 Alpha + zeta = dagda/scythe (extra deck lock) + F0 Utopic Draco Future (monster negate + steal) + Apollousa  (3 monster negates)</li>  	<li>2 Alpha + zeta = dagda/scythe (extra deck lock) + F0 Utopic Draco Future (monster negate + steal)+ Drytron Meteonis Draconids (huge untargetable beater, quick effect send 2 monsters to the gy)</li> </ul> Before going into Apollousa, it's possible to also go into Bethor (4+ card destroy, possibly a board wipe :D)  Another super cool combo is dagda + i:p, you lock the opponent's extra, summon scythe and then link for apollousa (or unicorn/phoenix/borrelsword if you want to play it)!  If you plan to propose this deck or get ideas from it I would appreciate the credits!  Thank you for reading, I'm open to every kind of suggestion to improve the deck and its strat. I personally think this is a great way to bring on our lovely Drytron deck!"

","The Basic Idea is to rush out armed dragon thunder lvl10 as quickly as possible and keep it alive. So most of the cards in the deck are about either searching for armed dragon cards to start the combo chain, add more cards to your hand in order to utilize his effect, or protect armed dragon from destruction.  Outside of starting with thunder lv3 in your hand, you have a few ways to get the combo started.  Both Tempest and wind channeler will search for lv 3 at a discard cost to help you get started, but be warned that discarding a armed dragon thunder with channeler will NOT activate their graveyard effects as she's not a dragon. However, pairing it with tempest WILL activate their effects which means more searches on top of the search.  Armed Dragon flash will also make this work, as it SS's lvl 3 thunder from the deck. Thus helping you start the level up combo.  Artillery Catapult Turtle is also very useful. By tributing itself for its effect, you can rush out a thunder lvl 5, starting you in the combo from their instead of lvl 3.  &nbsp;  Armed Dragon Lightning is likely to be your prime protection tool, as its searchable with thunder lv7's effect and recyclable with thunderbolt. If you can draw it, the field spell will basically make your thunder lv 10 and white unbeatable while it is in play, as it negates targets and destroys on your lvl 10 monsters.  &nbsp;  Now the original Lv10 is here due to armed dragon blitz, as thunder's name becomes the same as the original, blitz can be used to SS the original lv10 at no cost. Which leads you to a top row nuke at the cost of a discard.  &nbsp;  If you cannot get into thunder lvl 10 for some reason, you have other options. White is a great option as it can be SS'd if you managed to get decently far into the thunder combo but was stopped or if thunder is destroyed. Since it is paired with white veil, you get a backrow nuke and top row destroy on attack, and it negates any back row effects while it attacks which is great. While tempest is here mostly to push along the armed dragon engine and even reset it if needed, it can be used as a reliable attacker in a bind , as you special summon it by banishing armed dragons, even from the grave.  Now I have not put my extra deck largely for master duel reasons. as the star of your show is your main deck, you dont NEED specific extra deck cards in your extra deck to make this deck work. The extra deck just needs to be filled to be used for pot of extravagance. However, if you want to build your extra deck specifically for this deck. rank 10 xyz monsters will be your best bet, as that will be on your field the most with thunder lvl 10, normal lvl 10, and white. i personally recommend looking at the superdreadnought cards for this, but as every one is UR in master duel, they can get quite expensive. other possibilities are rank 7 xyz monsters due to tempest, you could stop at thunder lv 7 to put one of those out, aside from that im not sure what situation you'd use any others aside from link monsters."

Well you're in luck!  This deck is made up of only Normal and Rare trap cards and actually can put up a decent fight if you know when to activate cards.  Your main goal is to get some paleozoics on the field, Pacifics into the field zone to get some tokens on the board, phantasm spiral wave attached to a paleozoic or a token, and keep your opponent held down by the trap effects of each paleozoic, the hand effects of the phantasm trap cards, or lost wind as a card.  The extra deck can be something to go into if you have the proper cards on the field, like going into number 96/catshark and socuteboss and wipe the board or some cross-sheep combo, but your main combo will mostly wrap around your main deck. So good luck and have fun!"

The deck is a bit expensive due to Dinosaurs being expensive, but this deck can play well even in a Maxx C infested meta, so long as you don't come across True King of all Calamities.  It plays much like it did in the TCG, but with the lack of Artifact Lancea running around as of submitting this, this deck is able to thrive and either stop your opponent from playing when couple'd with a Barrier statue on top of 2-3 disruptions, or can break your opponent's board in typical Dino fashion.

If you used Scapeghost, you'll be left with one sheep token - use this to have Linkuriboh trigger Zeroboros' banish effect once your opponent has a full board without negates. Win next turn if you're lucky. Just remember Zeroboros' is NOT a quick effect - it resolves AFTER the current chain.</p>"

Enjoy the 6 more weeks of winter with this deck!,"Welp, this is my first post, more than likely not my last. Someone told me about Rikka and I immediately fell in love with the artwork and theme and pretty much cooked up this list immediately, in no way should this list be considered a final build. I noticed Rikka by themselves orient more towards control, but you can definitely turn them into a monster combo deck that can set you up insane board presence to wipe out your opponent or hold the line with their tribute effects. Also there's plenty of room with their typing, being water AND plants opens up insane options, I wanted to lay more into the plant side of things but there's plenty of water support to be considered as well. I had a ton of fun brewing with these cards and I plan on crafting this deck on Master Duel to see how it fares against the world! This one's for Horohoro and his endless field of butterbur! ... Or Something. Anyways, here's the list.  1x Tytannial, Princess of Camelias: One of the star techs of the deck, I'm a huge fan of the Plant Princesses and even though they aren't in archetype, all of them being Level 8 Plants allows them to synergize well with the main cast with relative ease. Tytannial works as a target negate, and is based after one of my favorite flowers. you can replace this with other cards like any of the other Princesses we don't run or something else like Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light.  1x Talaya, Princess of Cherry Blossoms: My other Princess tech and my favorite of the 4. Provides extra effect destruction protection which I always like to have more of, but feel free to experiment with other options.  1x Hellebore the Rikka Fairy: even though she's my personal favorite main deck monster, multiples will feel cloggy and we already run Camelia anyway. It is nice that she summons herself back for a tribute, I just wish it was a quick effect. You COULD get away with not running her, but just imagine how sad she'd be if you didn't use her at all. :'(  1x Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy: Extends and sets up your xyz plays, you could run more than 1 but it's not entirely necessary.  1x Erica the Rikka Fairy: Rikkas have a battle handtrap! That summons itself back! How cool is that?!  1x Mudan the Rikka Fairy: Adds a Rikka spell or trap to hand when you summon her, probably why she doesn't float back?  3x Cyclamen the Rikka Fairy: Tributes itself to reduce 2 levels, also brings itself back. you could replace this with another water level 4 to make Bahamut Shark but I decided to stick in house for theme-based fun.  3x Primula the Rikka Fairy: Summons itself from hand when another card gets tributed, also increases the levels of your plants by 2, this with evil thorn or lonefire is insane and she's really useful for facilitating other combos as well. arguably the most important Rikka card mechanically so definitely run her at 3  1x Rose Girl: Recyclable Halq target, level 3 for access to level 7 synchro plays.  3x Lonefire Blossom: The ultimate enabler for plants. tributes itself to summon ANY plant from the deck.  1x Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring: feels necessary but not in multiples since Called by hits Maxx C.  1x Spore: Same as Rose Girl but you can make Queen of Thorns with it. also an excellent One for One target.  3x Evil Thorn: Does petty burn damage and pulls 2 from deck making it a free Jasmine most of the time. this is what you;re aiming for with Lonefire and one for one if you don't get a copy in hand.  1x Copy plant: Extra Halq target but can realistically be anything. Go nuts.  1x Rikka Petal: Wittle beebee Rikka! Searches for a Rikka monster and summons itself if you only control plants, not terrible, basically a plant Treeborn Frog.  1x Rikka Flurries: Oh how fickle can they be, amirite? *shot* Forces your opponent to tribute a monster if you tribute a rikka but if you decide to go further into the extra deck it'll destroy itself at the end of your opponent's turn, definitely think before dropping this card, another spell could be reduced for this but I wouldn't try to rely on this one as amazing as the artwork is.  1x Harpies Feather Duster: Wipe up that backrow hate, skill drain is at 3 and vanity's is legal in Master Duel so we definitely want to keep the opponent's reverse cards in check.  1x One for One: One card in hand for a level 1, very fair trade considering 1 level 1 = huge profit. EZ math.  1x Monster Reborn: clutch extender or can revive a Princess  1x Pot of Avarice:Shuffe 5 monsters in grave to the deck or extra to draw 2. Recursion and draw, why be Extravagant?  3x Rikka Glamour: Searches a Rikka and lets you tribute to search any plant. It's really in here more for the second effect than the first to get out a Princess.  2x Called By the Grave: My favorite quick play spell currently since it checks so many things by removing a monster in grave from play AND negating that card's effects. Eldlich and Striker hate this card along with every handtrap amongst other things.  2x Enemy Controller (?!): this can be anything, I just figured it'd be fun to steal my opponents' things mid combo. a better card might be trade-in, ice dragons prison, imperm, but this is for the brave.  2x Twin Twisters: chainable hate for backrow hate.  2x Rikka Sheet: Catch your opponent's monster slippin' and negate its effects, or tribute a plant to make it slide on over to your side of the field for the turn and turn it into a plant.  1x Rikka Tranquility: Rikkursion (see what I did there?). If you tribute a plant you can get another one with the Rikka you summon off this, meaning you can spot dodge amongst other things.  &nbsp;  EXTRA DECK  1x Borrelload Savage Dragon: this can be anything else but since you'll probably send jasemine to make needlefiber why not turn it into 2 monster negates?  1x Perrialis, Empress of Blossoms: Can net you a princess or more fuel to tribute  1x Queen of Thorns: Burn your opponent for playing the game. I might switch Tytannial to Marina to protect this because it makes the other player stop to think for a second, 1000 LP is a lot  1x T. G. Wonder Magician : can be any other tuner synchro, it's just nice to be able to pop things.  1x Sacred Beast Hyperyton: Can detech an xyz to negate a card as the same one attached and can attach something from grave every turn, even more reason to try ouy Marina Princess of sunflowers. We make this by tributing Strenna with an xyz material  1x Teardrop the Rikka Queen: That art. &lt;3 That aside her effect to target and tribute anything on either player's turn is amazing. might drop the bahamut shark gimmick for another one of her and Strenna  1x Kanzashi the Rikka Queen; turns herself into a literal monster reborn if something gets tributed, also protects your board further which is nice  1x Bahamut Shark: makes Toad. that's it.  1x Bagooska the Terribly Tired Taper: make everything take a nap in an emergency.  1x Rikka Queen Strenna: lets you pick up a Rikka monster in grave and if she's tributed makes a bigger xyz with her as material. Hyperyton is her best buddy  1x Toadally Awesome: Shark makes this. this negates things. that's kind of it.  1x Hope harbinger Titanic Galaxy: Negates spells and forces your opponent to target it for attacks. If only he was a plant.  1x Aromaseraphy Jasmine: the link we aim for. lets you tribute a plant for any plant like lonefire.  1x Crystron Halqufibrax: Sets up synchro plays, also summons Wonder magician in emergencies'  1x Saryuja Skull Dread: this can be any link 4 but I have this one, also the 4 monster effect can come in handy in a bind.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ...and that's it! all you really need to know to get started is Evil thorn is your way into jasmine  and just pay attention to what you may need. Happy Dueling!  &nbsp;"

Just getting back into the game, and this was one of my first ideas for a build so I went with it.  Pretty standard cyber dragon build- Get monsters out on the field, go into predaplant for chimera, or galaxy soliders into xyz for infinity. Eternity for protection, Sieger for big damage. pretty typical CyDra OTK strategy.  The Dogmatika engine is interesting to me. Ecclesia seems like a good level 4 and can get into utopia for the double or nothing 10k attack, and fleur/maximus are good level 8's for dingirsu for protection.  Zeus and Relinquished for the ""Oh S***"" moments."

Link below  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=7HcvyKi8_Jo&amp;feature=y"">youtube.com/watch?v=7HcvyKi8_Jo&amp;feature=y</a> )  &nbsp;  The adverse side effects of high expectation includes depression, agony, and something to do with being slightly bipolar (not to say I am or not). Three years after getting new support for this archetype, the adverse technicality still holds up; but with cards like Nibiru, Forbidden Droplet/Chalice, and infinite impermanence being staples, the deck would struggle more than ever. Luckily there is a market to improve this, and hundreds of people would pull stupid shit for fifteen seconds of fame. That being said this is the post mortem of Magical Musketeers.  In reality, the deck wasn't too hard to make nor play by my own virtue. Rather than trying solely to focus on making the deck as pure as a prostitute on a Sunday, I insist to find some strengths and weakness to make use of a card known as ""Crossout Designator"". So by adding cards like Nibiru, Ash Blossom, Imperm, and Forbidden Droplet this would allow the deck to somewhat dodge these as due to negations from some of these most played cards are their weaknesses. Another factor of their issues is the lack of OTK preparations to which ""Magical Musket - Crooked Crown"" and ""Borrelsword Dragon"" has done a good job in doing so. Finally comes card recovery in all forms, which wasn't too big of a deal to solve so I used ""Pot of Avarice"", ""Daigusto Emeral"", and ""Magical Musketeer - Wild"" to allow the recoveries to be slightly easier.

Use some deck manipulation with slash draw to one-shot your opponent for the otk. This deck has a ton of card draw and can FTK but I won't label it as an ""FTK"" because that would be misleading.  Here is the combo: Use top share and place slash draw on top of your deck, set Big Eye, Use book of Taiyou to flip Big eye face up, place slash draw on the space that would be active (I can't describe it so read the card and how it works), set every card in your hand that you can (leave 1 spell/trap space open), and finally activate slash draw for a ton of damage.  The combo can also be done in other ways like just going for the big eye and hoping for a slash draw since it's just a great way to set up the cards that you draw next if you whiff.  This deck is built very similarly to an exodia deck but requires less specific cards in hand for the combo."

However as a long time lover of the Gravekeeper archetype I have toyed  and  fiddled with this deck to try and find a good balance of searching cards (Recruiter/Headman/Commandant)  &amp; ways to counter and clear the opponents field (Descendant/Supernaturalist).

It's used outside of the theme it was made for, but I'm using Necrovalley in it.  I'm returning to the theme I had as my main deck in 2009 and the years following that. This is the first 'proper' deck I completed in Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel.  I have used this deck in a duel video on Youtube: <a href=""https://youtu.be/lbK0HOQ-Q2o"" rel=""nofollow ugc"">https://youtu.be/lbK0HOQ-Q2o</a> It will be used in many videos going forward, so you will be able to see it in action more regularly."

Oh, yeah, it's also a Fabled deck. Well, turns out Fateful Adventure effect to send a card from your hand to the GY, while not triggering your Fabled effects, does set you up to start your combos with Abanc, Krus or Kushano."

Now as CL1 you revive the Genius Locci with Twin's effect and CL2 you'll use Dryas' effect to gain life points (since you took effect damage from Sowing) and summon Sunvine Healer. Remember to use Healer's effect to gain life points by targeting Dryas. Now you use Dryas and any other monster to go into your first Aromaseraphy Jasmine, but remember to leave one monster in a zone she points to. Now use Jasmine's effect to tribute a monster it points to and summon Aromage Laurel. Now link Laurel and the remaining monster in the main monster zone into your second Jasmine. This triggers Laurel's effect to gain life points, thus triggering the soft once per turn search effect of each Jasmine. From then on, it's up to you to decide which two plant monsters you need. I usually search for Snowdrop and Rose Girl to unbrick my hand with the former and have a monster to replace the one tributed for Snowdrop's effect with the latter.  NOTE: The side deck is not really a side deck and more of something to look at to remain humble while I was building this deck."

Traptrix is an archetype that build itself upon the normal ""Hole"" trap cards, cards that somehow negate and/or destroy monsters when they're summoned or their effects are used. We're mixing it with the splashable Eldlich archetype, which you should be very familiar with right now if you know ANYTHING about what's going on in YuGiOh right now, and if you don't, I recommend you read a few of their cards to see what kind of grind game they are capable of.  As stated, I combined 2 trap decks to make this abomination of a control deck, using cards like Void Trap Hole, Floodgate Trap Hole, and Network Trap Hole to keep your opponent off of their main starter monsters. Void's activation requirement is your opponent special summoning a monster with at least 2000 ATK. This can work if your opponent summons other monsters and with lower ATK values. You get to negate the effect of any of the summoned monsters with 2000+ ATK and pop it. Floodgate sets a summoned monster to face-down defense position and it can't change its battle positions by any means. Big thing to note with this Trap Hole: it works when your opponent summons multiple monsters and it'll set ALL of them face-down. That's nuts. Network banishes monsters special summoned from the main deck or GY face down, and Holes that banish are usually better than others, but the summon HAS to be from the main deck or GY. Gravedigger's negates the effect of a monster from the hand, GY, or banished zone, and burns them for 2000 damage if its successfully negated!  With all these ""Hole"" cards, we might as well run the Traptrix archetype, who's monsters are unaffected Hole traps. We have Myrmeleo, which will add a Hole trap to our hand if normal summoned and pop a spell/trap your opponent controls if special summoned. Dionaea reborns a Traptrix monster on its normal summon and sets a Hole from your GY but if its on the field at the end phase of your next turn, so it will most likely be used! Mantis adds a Traptrix monster on its normal summon and allows you to switch a set spell/trap from your field for one in hand once per turn as a quick effect. Vesiculo allows you to special summon it from hand if we send a set trap from our field to the GY, but Eldlich does this and he's bigger, so you'll do this for one of your Link or Xyz monsters most likely.  We got Eldlich the Golden Lord, the ultimate grind monster that allows you to send a spell/trap you control to the GY to summon him and with protection and a stat boost if summoned with his effect. If we have Eldlich, we might as well run the archetype cards to summon and support him. We have Eldlixer of Scarlet Sanguine which will summon Eldlich from the deck of GY, which is good enough to be ran. Our only 2 spells are 2 copies of Cursed Eldland, which can allow you to pay 800 to search Eldlich or a Golden Land trap from our deck. Note that only zombie-type monsters can attack if you activate this effect. Oh yeah, and if its sent from the field to the GY, you can foolish an Eldlich or Golden Land card. Now we have Huaquero of the Golden Land and Conquistador of the Golden Land. These are our only 2 Golden Land spell/traps and they get to act as trap monsters when activated and gain a bonus effect if Eldlich the Golden Lord is in your control. Huaquero banishes a card from either GY and Conquistador pops a face-up card on the field. They both have the effect to banish themselves from the GY in the end phase to set an Eldlixer from our deck to our field, and our only one is Scarlet Sanguine, so we'd get another Eldlich out anyway.  Now we'll go over our 2 non-archetype cards. Parallel eXceed can special summon itself from our hand if we link summoned, and to a zone it points to. If we manage to summon eXceed with its effect, we can pull a copy of it out of our deck. These eXceed are treated as Level 4, so we can use 'em for Link or Xyz plays, depends on the occassion. Skill Drain is for when we're more on the Eldlich plan than the Traptrix plan. Monster's effects are negated. So fun...  And now the Extra Deck, which you can splash anything in, but these are personal preferences. 2 Rafflesia allows you to send a Hole from deck to GY by removing a material to gain that hole's effect on a quick effect. It also gives your OTHER Traptrix monsters destruction protection from battle and card effects. Allomerus allows you to reborn a plant/insect monster from your GY by removing 2 materials and allows you to gain control of an opponent's monster that was sent to the GY or banished zone by one of your card effects at the cost of 1 material. Number 81 is just in case we have 2 Eldlich laying on the field, so we might as well get a slightly larger guy with protection from card effects. This is a monster you can honestly switch out for a GOOD Rank 4 Xyz like Abyss Dweller of Time Thief Redoer. Zeus is quite obvious why we run him: Make Xyz, use an effect of it, attack, summon big guy that has a quick effect board wipe. 3 Traptrix Sera, our Link 1 Traptrix allows us to special summon a unique Traptrix monster from deck if a normal trap card is activated. It doesn't even have to be a Hole trap or YOUR trap. Free special, woo! And vice-versa, it allows you to set a Hole if another Traptrix' effect is activated. 3 Cularia, and the main reason why I wanted to try Eldlich with this, is our Link 2 monster that allows us to set a Hole trap we just used back on the field instead of sending it to the GY and during your end phase, you get to reborn a Traptrix monster to defense position. The amount of possible recursion this single card provides is bonkers provided it sticks on the field, but its pretty good if you activate a Hole, set it, and use that set card to summon Eldlich. And lastly is our generic Link-climbing cards. Phoenix, Unicorn, Accesscode, and Apollousa, which has a quick effect negate once per chain as long as it has 800 ATK to sacrifice. Oh, and it gains 800 ATK for each of its materials, so you'll usually have 2-4 negates.  That's it for the deck list! Honestly, it seems solid, but you can definitely replace the 3 Skill Drain with a copy of Imperial Order since you only have 2 spell cards and 2 other cards that you prefer, but it DEFINITELY gets shit on with a Harpie's Feather Duster, Lightning Storm, and any monster that has protection from Trap cards. Hopefully y'all learned something from this. Have fun making your opponent wanna rip their own hair out by not allowing them to play the game!  &nbsp;"

But will you be the choosen one ?,"Hy there...  Here is my decklist of a pure Mekk-knight deck. For the few people who never seen this archetype, this deck where released in 2018 and the gimmick of mekk-knight is to play with both player's collomn.  In fact, most of them have the effect that let you summon himself from hand as long as there is two cards on the same collomn on the field and you special summon the mekk-knight on this collomn, but you can only speciel summon one copy of each name per turn.  First of all, mekk-knight is meant to mostly goes second, because their sommun doesn't trigger negates, which is nice to break boards, on top of their high Atk and Def point, and their easy summon condition when going second, plus they are super consistent and fastly swarm the board with high stats monster.  This is the reason why I don't play any hand-trap on main except nibiru, because every hadtrap won't be effective 100% of the time while board breaker on going second will be pulled of more often. Plus, our format is mostly going first deck, so playing a going second deck gives an insane advatage because the result of the coin flip will basically never matter as you will go second 90% of the time. Plus, a nibiru on main can be super effective as some deck won't be expecting him on game one.  I play gameciel as a way to settup collomn for ""blue sky"" who can search from one to three mekk from your deck to your hand, and if this resolves, you will certainly otk your opponent.  Girsu is obviously a three of because it is a one-card iblee, which can setup your following up and your collomns easely. On top, I play corruptor Iblee because she will summon on the opponen't side of the field, so great for ""blue sky"" and enabe your opponen't for playing nibiru at all, and might shut down a lot of meta deck, mostly tri-brigade and swordsoul, who will struggles getting rid of her and not focuses on your board. But becareful of anaconda verte predaplant, you might end of giving them a free access to dragoon or DPE (or battle buttler for prank-kids).  This deck is really good and have a lot of good matchups against meta decks, one of the easiest one is Sky Striker, mostly thanks to your mekk-knights being able to swarm the field, and also some card are a huge counter to them, just like iblee, gameciel world legacy's whispers, a trap that negate spells on field that is on the same collomn of a mekk-knight (this is not a trigger effet and can even prevent any dodging).  To be honest, there is no budget option for pot of prosperity, this card is unfortunately mandatory, especially since pot of desire, the only card that where not bad enought to see a little bit played, but now, prosperity is a must-play.  I play gameciel because the bird lock isn't releavant anymore, since simogh got hit, and I don't see any deck running a barrier statue to normal nummon and pass... I would also recommand you to change the evenly matched for lightning storm if you can afford it, but I can't so I have to play some ""budget"" option instead, that doesn't really synergise with the deck and make you loose your deck advantage by making you loose your battle phase.  I know there is a lot of people who want to play ""World Legacy World Armor"" and ""World Legacy succession"", but I found out thatthe WLWA combo is like putting all your eggs on the same basket, and I prefer keeping more board presence to be able to control my opponent easier. Also, by playing the deck a lot, I've found out that succession is an amazing card but isn't needed on mekk-knight, because usually, you will rapidly win or rapidly loose, and I have never used this card. This is the reason why I play a one-of called by, who can prevent an ash on Blue or, more deadly, A droll and lock bird.  For the side deck, there is a lot of heavy backrow trategy, so I had to play tree of twin twister on top of the two cyclone to get rid of the skill drain and ice dragon's prison to banish the two Eldlich, which means game for us. Also, putting a contact ""C"" might proove fatal against sky striker or prank-kids and swordsoul and many other decks. Lancea is great because it make passes turn any flowandereese deck and handicaps phantom knight (in the condition that they haven't they adventurer negate). Red reboot is just another backrow-hate.  This deck might seems like nothing but from now, if you still play two cards on the same collomn, karma will send you a mekk-knight deck and you will learn why you have to NEVER play two cards on the same collomn.  A pretty fun deck with a lot of potential, each duel is for me like a boss fight, where I have to give everything I have to break the opponen't board and setup a little bit of control, who can prove fatal if they don't have enough cards to come bach.  &nbsp;"

Did you ever, at least once in your life, wished to be able to beat the everliving shit out of your opponent? Well, sadly we can't because that'd be classified as Assault but hey, I've got an alternative that can be just as good as that. Presenting, Powerload Ogre Turbo.  <strong>Part I: The game plan.</strong>  <span>It's simple. Going 1st, you either make two <a data-name=""Gouki the Powerload Ogre"">Gouki the Powerload Ogre</a>s or one of it and a <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> protected with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, or if you drew the nuts, two Gouki the Powerload Ogre AND a Masquerena protected Avramax. Going 2nd, you pray that you're able to draw either <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> or <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Gouki Suprex"">Gouki Suprex</a> + another name and proceed as usual. No, we're not using <a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Nights"">Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Nights</a> here because the bricks just aren't worth it, but we're using the Codebreaker package just because it's a generic Link climbing tool for Warrior decks. All gas, no brakes. The only reason why I run <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> in this build instead of <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> is because the only interaction we have with our opponent is the Battle Phase.</span>  <strong>Part II: The hand traps (I guess).</strong>  <span>The only hand trap you need here is <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, really. I only chose <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> because fuck Drytrons, and I deliberately did not craft <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> out of spite to the OCG ban list, and the fact that MD is using that dog shit format is enough proof to me that Konami never learned from their mistakes in the past format but I digress. Basically this could be any staple you want. If you want to play <a data-name=""Photon Thrasher"">Photon Thrasher</a> as a starter as well, fuck it, it's a free Special Summon and a Warrior on board.</span>  <strong>Part III: The staples</strong>  <span>If you want to use a consistency card, either <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> (though counterproductive to the game plan which is OTKing) or <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> (which is also kinda counterproductive since it halves the damage you deal during the turn you use it) could be nice. <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> is bad because you do not have control over which cards you're gonna banish, and there will be games where you need most if not all of your Extra Deck cards. The draw 3 from <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a> could be good, if not only because it just straight up defeats the purpose of your deck by not making you deal damage when it is used. You know what else is funny about this deck? Your <a data-name=""Gouki the Powerload Ogre"">Gouki the Powerload Ogre</a>s can comfortably sit under <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, so if you wanna run that as well, go for it.</span>  Overall, this deck doesn't really need to ""have"" the Masquerena + Avramax package, it's just an additional towers boss monster that I thought would be nice to have since it's not really that hard to make in this deck, so the only mandatory UR in this deck is the triple copies of Gouki Re-Match. It's a pretty straightforward Link climbing deck, it can be just as budget or expensive as you want depending on whether you wanna run <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> with at least 1 copy of <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> as a target or not, it's totally up to you."

Then Special Summon Puddingcess from Deck or Hand. Xyz Summon Glassoufle in Defense Position. Activate Glassoufle effect, sending Petingcessoeur to the GY and targeting anyone. Xyz Summon Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode using Glassoufle. Activate A-la-Mode effect to send Petingcessoeur back to the deck (if Chateau is on the field, don't put it in hand). A-la-Mode triggers and activate it detaching Glassoufle.  From here we have a few options. If Anjelly wasn't used to find Petingcessoeur yet, it can be used to find the follow up cards. Otherwise, choose Hootcake with A-la-Mode effect and onto the field. Banish Glassoufle for Hootcake's effect and Special Summon Messengelato. With Messengelato we can find the 3 main spell cards in the Madolche archetype: <ul>  	<li>Salon: Any Madolche that returns from Field or GY to Hand or Deck allows to search a Madolche Spell/Trap and set it directly to the Field, therefore, it's another way to search the main Spell cards. It also allows a second Normal Summon if one is a Madolche monster, good to use level 4 monster from hand in case there aren't enough on the field to Xyz.</li>  	<li>Ticket: Any Madolche that returns from Field or GY to Hand or Deck allows to search a Madolche monster to the Hand. If a Fairy Madolche is on the Field, it Special Summons it. Anjelly, Petingcessoeur, Puddingcess, Glassoufle, Tiaramisu and A-la-Mode are all Fairies allowing to Special Summon Messengelato when a Beast type is on the field to find any Madolche Spell/Trap.</li>  	<li>Chateau: Besides from the obvious 500 ATK/DEF bonus to any Madolche monster, this spell allows to return any Madolches in GY to Deck, triggering effects like Ticket, Salon and A-la-Mode.</li> </ul> Usually, I go Chateau, Salon, Ticket. Bringing Chateau with Messengelato allows to return Anjelly in GY to Deck, triggering A-la-Mode again, detaching Puddingcess to find another Messengelato. With the second one find Salon if you plan on Xyz Summoning Tiaramisu to return things to the opponent's deck for this will trigger Salon and give you access to a Promenade as a protection. If you don't plan or don't have more ways to trigger Madolche's return ability, search Promenade as the protection it gives is imperative if you don't finish the game that turn.  As it can be understood, having some Madolches in the GY is good as it allows effects like Promenade, Tiaramisu, Lesson and A-la-Mode. One easy way to put monsters on the grave is Link Summoning Fresh Sistart, giving 2 bodies for the effects. Sistart is herself a way to trigger Salon, Ticket or A-la-Mode as it can prevent being destroyed by returning 1 Madolche monster to the Deck.  On other simplier synergies we have Mewfeuille that, when Normal Summoned, Special Summons Messengelato from Hand, searching the Madolche Spells/Traps. Cruffssant can return ANY Madolche card on the field to raise it's level to 4 and gain 300 ATK/DEF, being one of the 2 non-Extra Deck monsters with highest ATK possible (short of Lesson), however careful to not have Sistart pointing to any Madolche as it protects Madolche Spells/Traps even from your own effects (the amount of times I saw myself obligated to return a monster are too many). Lesson serves as a finisher in case you need that extra 800 ATK/DEF to go over your opponent's defenses or another way to return Madolches to the Deck.  Regarding non-Madolche cards, Impermanence is a handtrap for turn 1 effects, Called by the Grave stops other handtraps and Twin Twisters destroys Spells/Traps for the price of putting a Madolche in the GY from Hand. Card of Fate is a personal fan card that may or may not give you Petingcessoeur. Abyss Dweller is a GY hate card, Bagooska is a total lockdown for 2 turns, but I play it cause it looks cute, Phoenix is an easy Spell/Trap removal and Almiraj is protection against removal."

Though you will still have some options available to you.  For monster heavy boards, Book of Moon and Forbidden Chalice work great as single monster negates.  Effect Veiler is a nice cheap handtrap that can still be impactful in stopping some plays, such as hitting a Rusty Bardiche to stop them from setting up Fog Blade.  While you can always cut Harpie's Feather Storm cause it is a bit costly, it is still a great turn ender that requires very little set up.  Side deck is mostly just suggestions. Backrow tends to be difficult to deal with so you run the cosmic + duster package. Anti-Spell + Dark Simorgh shuts down spells entirely. D. D. Crow works great against decks such as Eldlich and Sky Striker and is searchable through Robina. Dimension Barrier works great in hindering Swordsoul or Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika  You can always interchange these cards with board breakers such as Raigeki or Dark Hole. Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched would be great cards here, but they're incredibly expensive."

I'm shedding the Fusionist persona for a bit because I gotta admit to all y'all guys, my mental state have been spiraling out of control ever since I've played the OCG format again through Master Duel, no joke. I mean, I might be insane because, imagine not enjoying a best of one OCG format with <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> being legal and Drytron is at full power. I must really be stupid at Konami's eyes because, what do I know about game balance. If it brings money, it should be a perfectly healthy card, am I right? But I digress. Anyway, here's presenting the embodiment of my descent into the Joker arc, Eldlich Guru.  It's just such a shame that <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> is banned, I would have loved to commit war crimes in this dog shit ass format. This is pretty much just a standard Eldlich and Guru list, mashed together with the addition of some hand traps and floodgates including the staple <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, and <a data-name=""Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric"">Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric</a> because for some reason, <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> is legal, I'd hate to be that guy, but might as well abuse it.  As per usual, the cards on the side will be those that can be nice to have. I'm sorry if there's not much in-depth discussion with this one with in terms of the deck choices because, I'm just really enervated, and I'd rather keep it short and simple, because there's really not much else to say but ""all it takes is one bad format"". Feel free to ask anything down in the comments, though. I'll answer them as soon as I can.  :)"

I only used a maximum of two copies for staples since I have to balance between survival and potential bricking.  If you're going first, you could go into <strong>Firewall Dragon </strong><strong>Darkfluid</strong> with at least two counters and protection (<strong>Gatchiri</strong> or <strong>Light Dragon</strong>). If you have a good hand, you could send <strong>Water Leviathan</strong> into the GY instead of <strong>Gatchiri</strong> with the <strong>Bururu</strong> effect, or use <strong>AI Love Fusion</strong> to bring out <strong>Earth Golem </strong>as Link material to provide more counters. Along with handtraps and/or quick-play spells, you could shut down many decks provided that they don't have <strong>Lava Golem</strong> or <strong>Kaiju</strong>.  My past iteration used <strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong> + <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> instead of <strong>Darkfluid</strong>. However, I was traumatized by <strong>Tri-Brigade Lyrilusc</strong> in the ladder (damn you <strong>Shuraig </strong>and <strong>Draco Future</strong>), so I opted for another boss monster. <strong>Arrival</strong> won't cut it since it is vulnerable to decks that can easily bring out beatsticks like <strong>Utopia </strong>and even <strong>Kaiju </strong>(it is expensive to bring out that you can't afford to lose it).  If you're going second, you could try to circumvent their defenses to bring out <strong>Splash Mage</strong> + <strong>Update Jammer</strong> into <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>. You can use <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> instead of <strong>Splash Mage</strong> at your own risk, but keep in mind that <em>4300*2</em> can win you the game as much as <em>5300*2</em>. Although, if you need more ammunition for <strong>Accesscode</strong>, you could go for <strong>Transcode.</strong>  You need to be careful about the placement of your monsters, especially for <strong>Dark Templar</strong> and <strong>Dark Infant</strong>. Ideally, <strong>Dark Templar</strong> must be in the right EMZ with <strong>Dark Infant</strong> summoned in the leftmost link arrow. The left side of your <strong>Dark Infant</strong> must also be empty since it will move to that zone after chaining with <strong>Dark Templar</strong> in order to make way for the special summoned monsters from the GY.  Using the effects of <strong>Dark Templar</strong> and <strong>Dark Infant</strong>, you can special summon 3 monsters from your GY. It is recommended that you choose <strong>Bururu</strong> + <strong>Pikari </strong>(don't use effect yet since it is negated) + 1 (preferably <strong>Doyon</strong>). Synchro Summon <strong>Wind Pegasus</strong> (use this as material for <strong>Darkfluid</strong> since this is very useful in dealing with most invincible monsters even when it is in your GY) using <strong>Bururu</strong> and <strong>Pikari</strong>. <strong>Pikari</strong> will then come back to the field via <strong>Bururu</strong>'s effect. If needed, you can use <strong>Pikari</strong>'s effect to change the level of the other monster to 4 (unnecessary if you have <strong>Doyon</strong>), then Xyz Summon <strong>Light Dragon</strong>. Use <strong>AI Love Fusion</strong> to Fusion Summon <strong>Earth Golem</strong> using <strong>Dark Infant</strong> (don't expose a 500 ATK Link monster in the open) and another monster.  Note: In another iteration, I would've brought out <strong>Cyberse Quantum Dragon</strong> instead of <strong>Wind Pegasus</strong> and <strong>Dark Templar</strong> + <strong>Dark Infant</strong> into <strong>Avramax</strong>, but it is vulnerable to many plays without the means to counter.  The most common sequence is <strong>Dark Infant</strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Cyberse Wicckid</strong> (search out <strong>Bururu</strong>, but skip this if you already have it) &gt;&gt; <strong>Splash Mage</strong> (don't use its effect if you plan to go into <strong>Transcode</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> (skip this if you used <strong>Kaiju</strong>) &gt;&gt; <strong>Dark Templar</strong>. There are many routes and detours to the combo, however, going into <strong>Dark Templar</strong> while having a monster that can be summoned and <strong>Dark Infant</strong> in your Extra Deck is the most ideal scenario. One thing to note is that you are expected to utilize <strong>Achichi</strong>, <strong>Pikari</strong>, <strong>Bururu</strong>, and <strong>Doyon</strong>. <strong>Doshin</strong> and <strong>Hiyari</strong> are just luxury monsters that can extend your combo or help you in a pinch.  If you find yourself in tough spots, don't ignore the other @Ignister monsters since they have very useful effects.  Use <strong>Fire Phoenix</strong> when you don't have enough cards to continue the combo, since it can float and has a monster destruction effect (during the battle phase, banish <strong>Achichi</strong> from GY if necessary).  Use <strong>Wind Pegasus</strong> to clean backrow as well as provide a ""revenge"" mechanism to your board (even in the GY).  Use <strong>Light Dragon</strong> to clean monster zone and resurrect a link monster as soon as you deal battle damage with other Cyberse monsters (works in the battle phase).  Use <strong>Water Leviathan</strong> to reduce a monster's attack to 0 while returning all your link monsters from the GY to the Extra Deck (the other effect doesn't work against most decks since only monsters with 2300 ATK or less are returned to the hand).  <strong>Earth Golem</strong> is usually just fodder for <strong>Darkfluid</strong> but it could still be useful in some scenarios.  The best thing about them is that you can directly resurrect them with <strong>AIdle Reborn</strong> and <strong>FAIghting Spirit</strong>, or return them to the hand with <strong>Doyon</strong> (you can also retrieve related spells with <strong>Doyon</strong>'s effect in the GY). However, if you plan to make use of <strong>Dark Templar</strong> from the GY, don't resurrect it since it can't be placed in the EMZ this way, instead use <strong>Doyon</strong>, <strong>Water Leviathan</strong>, or <strong>Doshin</strong> (if <strong>AI Love Fusion</strong> is still in the deck).  If you used <strong>Kaiju</strong>, don't go into <strong>Transcode Talker</strong> since it won't activate its effect and you'll end up wasting your combo potential.  You can see this deck in action on Master Duel. IGN: Allemere ID: 855-035-170"

You can all but guarantee that nothing in this deck (or at least nothing important) will be touched by a new Master Duel banlist should one come out in the near future.</li>  	<li>It's unpredictable. Yugioh players have somewhat of a reputation for not reading cards, and even many who do will miss things like <strong>Right-Hand Shark</strong>'s battle protection. Many of the people you will play against wont have seen much of this deck and wont know how to properly play against it.</li> </ol> <b>Card Explanations </b> <ul>  	<li>The Fishes (and <strong>Tin Goldfish) </strong>- You will rarely find a hand in this deck that can't make <strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen</strong> even through getting hand trapped and many of them can also throw out an additional rank 4, usually being your choice of <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> (which actually benefits nicely from it's attack boosting effect) or <strong>Bahamut Shark</strong> into <strong>Toadally Awesome</strong>.  <strong>Right-hand Shark</strong>'s battle protecting will usually either force your opponent to destroy Kragen by a card effect netting you more advantage or will help you survive to OTK your opponent on the crack back. The several two-of's might seem odd but you rarely want or need to see multiples and it's great in combination with <strong>White Mirror.</strong></li>  	<li>The Staples - Play what you have. A huge advantage in playing this deck is that it can comfortably go first when you win the die roll but has plenty of room to play versatile hand traps and ""going second"" staples. <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> into <strong>Mudragon of the Swamp</strong> has extra synergy in this deck since he happens to be a water. <strong>Lava Golem</strong> might seem like a weird include, but many of your hands don't require your normal summon and this deck often steals games by burning your opponent to death. It's also a super rare. If you already have <strong>Forbidden Droplets, </strong><strong>Dark Ruler No More, </strong>or <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, feel free to experiment with those instead.</li>  	<li>The Extra Deck - The only cards you absolutely need here to play the deck is <strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen </strong>and <strong>Stealth Kragen Spawn</strong>, with close runner-ups being <strong>Abyss Dweller </strong>with <strong>Bahamut Shark</strong> with <strong>Toadally Awesome. </strong>The Floating from your Kragen's easily help you go into <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future </strong>into <strong>Number F0:Utopic Draco Future. </strong><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-Zues - Sky Thunder </strong>can even by cheesed out by crashing a Kragen or something else protected by <strong>Right-Hand Shark </strong>into an opponents monster and then overlaying in Main Phase 2. If you have any staple rank 4's like <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double </strong>or <strong>Tornado Dragon</strong>, feel free to run them, but remember that some of your shark engine will lock you into water's for the turn.</li>  	<li>Gozen Match - <strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen </strong>turns all monsters your opponent controls into Water's, so Gozen can lock them out of the game. Very few decks are playing any Water's at all. Even without Kragen, it's a pretty solid floodgate on it's own right and basically doesn't effect you. It's also pretty hilarious giving your opponent a <strong>Lava Golem</strong> going second then flipping Gozen on them on their turn.</li> </ul> As with many decks, feel free to mess around with the ratio's and some spicy techs like <strong>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</strong>, <strong>Xyz Remora</strong>, or <strong>Number 71: Rebarian Shark</strong>. Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding the deck."

Good enough to get into Plat, but not quite good enough to make it to the higher levels.","Do you want a deck with turns that don't take 40 years? Do you want a deck with combos that don't require 13 steps? Do you want a deck with both cute girls and dragons? Do you want easy wins and to rise to plat 1? Well for that last part you may want to look elsewhere, but for the rest Dragonmaids are the deck for you. The basic plan with this deck is to adapt to going first or second, either getting out Sheou turn one if possible and if not hopefully hieratic and maybe a Dragonmaid Tidying. If going second there's enough hand traps/ board clear to hopefully disrupt your opponets turn enough that they can't respond to your Dragonmaids. Feel free to shift the Maxx C/Ash/Infinites out for your personal favorite field traps/board control, I've just found this combo best handles all but the top 4 decks. Parlor and chamber are the most crucial as they can either get you your fusion spell or put the last monster you need in the graveyard, or shift a tidying in there for a handy special summon. The biggest thing I can recommend is to usually wait as long as possible before activating Sheou's negate. While it is a very handy omni-destruction negate it is a hard once per turn. So even if you manage to trick out another Sheou (which is possible) it won't have its negate until next turn. Its also definitely worth getting either Sheou or House out in Main phase 2 as their effects activate during you opponent's standby phase as well as yours. And lastly try really hard not to get too gung ho about popping the higher level dragon maids back into your hand and putting the low level ones on the field, as if your opponent manages to clear the board before the battle phase you are stuck with a dead hand.  This is a very fun deck with a cool theme, but one that won't see as much success as the current big meta decks.

Usually, you want to go with your usual Evil Twins setup to pick apart your opponent's board.  Use Underworld Goddess of the Closed World to get rid of problematic monsters.  If the board allows you to, you can go for a 4-material Zeus with Sky Cavalry Centaurea and Downerd Magician.  &nbsp;  Overall, the deck feels better going second as it allows for more versatility.

It's impossible to run any other Pot card, as Extravagance and Prosperity lock you out of drawing for the turn, and in a list full of Danger! monsters you lose a lot of value. So, instead, I'm maxing out on Eater of Millions, hoping to see it rather consistently in the turns 1 to 4 to combo it with Gren Maju and finish the game right there.  The Danger! engine is quite large, as it takes a hard approach on it, even more since Nessie has been released off the banlist and is now at 3 copies. All the Danger! monsters serve the purpose of digging through your deck, put bodies on the field (especially the level 8 ones, such as Bifgfoot, Thunderbird and Ogopogo) to go into powerful XYZ monsters like Dingirsu, Draglubion (your way to cheat out Numeron Dragon) and Hope Harbinger. Even if the levels don't match, the link monsters in this deck are quite powerful, but I would really consider replacing Zeroboros with Accesscode.  Eater of Millions and Gizmek Orochi are the primary ways to banish cards, obviously including the 1-off Pot of Desires, so it's a 7/40 of cards that banish your deck/extra deck massively. With that in mind, you can't always rely on Gren Maju to OTK, and that's where the XYZ - link monsters enter in the list, as well as huge going-second powerhouses such as Pankratops, Lightning Storm, Feather Duster, Super Poly (with various targets, and specific ones for DIDS and Eldlich) and Nibiru (which is a powerful card even going 1st, don't get me wrong) and even maxing out the going 2nd cards in the side deck, including ones such as Evenly Matched, the 3-off Raigeki, a lone Cosmic Cyclone and Red Reboot.  The deck lacks real consistency, as most of the time the Danger! engine has a RNG component that you sometimes can't play around (and if it fails, you're done) and it can be combined with other cards instead of the ones I chose, such as the Golden Castle of Stromberg package (which not only helps with battle protection and banishing, but also has a LVL8 Special Summon from the deck at the cost of your Normal Summon, and both a MST with legs and field searcher), the full-on banishing cards (adding specifically Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Dim Fissure and the like) and many other variants that I'm still needing to test in order to make sure they still work as they did before.  Any, I mean, ANY change you make to the deck, please, comment it (if possible), so I can test it myself and maybe improve the deck all together."

Aromage Marjoram is just good insurance really and for getting rid of Shaddoll's Fusion cards in the graveyard and other decks combo pieces. Gingerbread House is a pretty odd one for a aromage deck, but it helps control the board quite well by getting rid of their bigger monsters during their standby phase. Blessed Winds is saves this deck a lot by recycling cards like Rikka Petal, Lonefire Blossom, and Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy."

You can easily OTK with one timelord (any), and bringing Eldlich to the field, going into Gustav Max, activate its effect for 2000 burn damage then Super Dora at 6000 atk and going for the kill for a total of 8000 damage in one turn. You can also execute this strategy on another turn with the metal slime.  You can also play it as a classic Timelord burn deck as you have all the cards required to do so, you'd want to first attack with michion to bring down the opponent lp to 4000 then finish with either Sandaion, Raphion or Eldlich. Bear in mind that Eldlich is a level 10 monster that also benefit from the protection of Mound of the bound creator and its burn effect.  The addition of the Eldlich engine also allows you to pop problem cards that plagued traditional Timelord deck such as Skill Drain.  Bear in mind though that activating the graveyard effect of Time Maiden or the field effect of Eldlixir of Black Awakenening locks you from playing your extra deck combos, otherwise you're free to play as you want.

You can easily OTK with one timelord (any), and bringing Eldlich to the field, going into Gustav Max, activate its effect for 2000 burn damage then Super Dora at 6000 atk and going for the kill for a total of 8000 damage in one turn. You can also execute this strategy on another turn with the metal slime.  You can also play it as a classic Timelord burn deck as you have all the cards required to do so, you'd want to first attack with michion to bring down the opponent lp to 4000 then finish with either Sandaion, Raphion or Eldlich. Bear in mind that Eldlich is a level 10 monster that also benefit from the protection of Mound of the bound creator and its burn effect.  The addition of the Eldlich engine also allows you to pop problem cards that plagued traditional Timelord deck such as Skill Drain.  Bear in mind though that activating the graveyard effect of Time Maiden or the field effect of Eldlixir of Black Awakenening locks you from playing your extra deck combos, otherwise you're free to play as you want. You should also play the field effect of Eldlixir of Black Awakening at the end of your combo so it doesn't lock you from summoning other monster types."

Control your opponent, si","https://youtu.be/OfpnygacdOk  When the Charmer Structure Deck arrived in the TCG Fall 2020, duelists around the world were hit with disappointment. Highly sought-after staples like Evenly Matched was replaced by cards like Raigeki. The “Charmer” cards were lacklustre and did not do enough to please it’s fans. The promise of a playable Charmer archetype felt like another classic Komoney move – duelist’s expectations were crushed after showing lots of potential.  Functioning like a deck from 2010 rather than 2020, the deck had a swarmy beatdown playstyle held up with rickety spell/trap support in the backrow. Dismissed as a “casual DM-era waifu nostalgia bait” structure deck, most duelists neglected the charmers, branding it as one of the worst sets to come out in the TCG.  However, several new factors gave indirect support to this ailing archetype! With the new stun/control tools that the 2022 banlist enables, combined with cards from recent sets like Lord of the Heavenly Prison, Incredible Ecclesia, and Zoroa The Magistus Conflagrant Calamity the deck can actually hold its own as a control rogue deck! Functioning a lot like our favourite Golden Boy “Eldlich,” Charming Control stuns out your opponent, sets up multiple interruptions/negates and beats them down with 3000/4000ATK+ monsters!  <span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span>  The <strong>CHARMER</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 12 cards:  <em>1 of each of the Familiar-Possessed Charmers </em><em>(Earth, Water, Fire and Wind</em><em>), 3 Spirit Charmers, 2 Awakening of the Possessed, 2 Possessed Partnerships and 1 Unpossessed. </em>In the Extra Deck there is <em>1 of each of the Familiar-Possessed Charmers (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Light and Dark)</em>. The backrow Charmer Cards serve as the primary core of the deck, serving as its draw engine, recovery, and control. The Extra Deck Charmers give the player a means to link away stolen monsters.  The <strong>DOGMATIKA</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 5 cards:  <em>2 Nadir Servant, 1 Ecclesia, 1 Fleurdelis,</em> and <em>1 Punishment</em>. In the Extra Deck, <em>2 Elder Entity N’tss</em> and <em>1 Titaniklad</em> serve as the dump targets for Nadir Servant. The Dogmatika package serve as a potent form of removal, interruption and as an additional way to get extra free bodies on board.  The <strong>SWORDSOUL</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 5 cards:  <em>3 Incredible Ecclesia</em>, and <em>2 The Iris Swordsoul</em>. Both cards serve as free special summons. Incredible Ecclesia opens up synchro plays like Zoroa and Savage Dragon, while Iris Swordsoul is a strong card in itself with its many beneficial effects that offer control and card advantage.  The <strong>MAGISTUS</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 3 cards:  3 Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame. Magistus cards have much more presence in the Extra deck, consisting of 5 cards: 2 Artemis, 1 Conflagrant Calamity, 1 Vahram and 1 Aiwass. The Magistus archetype offers a toolbox of options for many situations, but Zoroa usually turbos out level 8 synchro monsters that control the board. Zoroa is a one and a half card Borreload Savage!  The <strong>STAPLE</strong> cards in this deck take up the last 15 slots in this deck.  The Staple monsters are <em>3 Lord of the Heavenly Prison</em> and <em>3 Fairy Tail – Luna</em>.  Both cards are extremely potent for the Charming Control strategy, with Lord of the Heavenly Prison searching out any Spell/Trap (usually Spirit Charmers) and protecting backrow.  Luna is low key the MVP of this deck since it fulfills the requirements to trigger Awakening of the Possessed’s +1 draw effect, bounces back opponent’s monsters with it’s quick effect, and searches any 1850ATK spellcaster!  The Staple backrow consist of 9 powerful trap cards, each chosen for their synergy with Charmers.  <em>3 Crackdown</em> and <em>3 Ice Dragon’s Prison</em> interrupt your opponent by stealing their key combo piece monster from their field/GY, which correctly timed, is often enough to end their turn. During your turn, they can be linked away into the appropriate Charmer of choice, then you can again resurrect their monster to your side of the field!  <em>3 Skill Drains</em> are the secret weapon of this deck, and this deck plays perfectly fine with this card on the field! Most interactions/plays that this deck makes is due to backrow support, and once your monsters are supported by Awakening of the Possessed, the game becomes simplified enough where it becomes caveman Yugioh – no effects, no combos, just straight up beatdown!  Cool interactions with this card and the deck include <em>The Iris Swordsoul</em>, where she can summon herself from hand for free if monsters on the field are currently negated – a condition that Skill Drain easily fulfills. <em>Incredible Ecclesia</em> can still tribute herself to summon Iris from deck, since her effect activates in the GY, and not on the field. <em>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</em> triggers and resolves IN HAND and not on the field, so it search for your spell/trap of your choice despite Skill Drain being active! Finally, extra deck cards like <em>N’Tss, Titanklad</em> and <em>Vahram</em> trigger in the GY, so they can function well with Skill Drain on the field.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span>  The cool thing about this deck is that it doesn’t feature any combos, since it’s mostly a “set 4 and normal summon -&gt; pass” style of deck, making it pretty simple to use!  The entire premise of this deck is to control your opponent with backrow, then beat them in a simplified gamestate, where beatdown with strong superior monsters reign supreme.  Depending on your hand, the most ideal turn 1 set-up would be active Charmer Spell/Traps, supported by other generic forms of interruption, like Dogmatika cards, an Borreload Savage, etc.  Awakening of the Possessed is the most important card in this case, since it boosts your monster by 300ATK for every attribute on your field, and gives you a +1 draw every time you summon a 1850 ATK spellcaster. This card STACKS, meaning multiple copies of this card can be activated for an even bigger attack boost, so instead of +300 for every attribute, you get +600 if you have two copies! Before you know it, your opponent may be staring down a 3050 ATK charmer and 5200ATK Borreload Savage Dragon!  In a grindgame this deck does reasonably well since it generates advantage in various ways. Luna gets you another 1850 spellcaster, Zoroa once equipped with Artemis can search for himself, The Iris Swordsoul gives a +2 draw if your opponent summons from deck and Awakening of the Possessed gets you +1 draw everytime you summon a 1850ATK spellcaster, which is something you’ll do often. If your opponent wipes out your entire backrow, Possessed Partnerships can re-activate a Possessed continuous Spell/Trap from the GY. Finally, all the Extra Deck charmers give you extra monsters on board by reviving your opponent’s monster, and they all float into their attribute appropriate monster from deck!  If you anticipate a grindgame, Unpossessed is an ideal card to set-up. ANY monster of yours that would be destroyed will float into a 1500 ATK spellcaster, and that would be any of the Elemental Charmers, Any Ecclesia, and Zoroa!  Speaking of Zoroa, that card is a on2 and a half card Borreload Savage Dragon! Here is the only combo this deck features: <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Zoroa.</li>  	<li>Activate Zoroa’s effect to equip Artemis from Extra Deck to him. His Trigger effect will activate, summoning a level 4 spellcaster from your hand/GY.</li>  	<li>Activate Artemis’ searching effect to get you a Magistus monster from deck. It will be Zoroa, so you will have follow-up for next turn.</li>  	<li>Synchro away Zoroa + the level 4 spellcaster into Borreload Savage Dragon.</li>  	<li>Borreload Savage Dragon equips Artemis from GY, giving you one omni-negate, 1 Zoroa for next turn, and a 3400 ATK monster.</li> </ol> Zoroa can also turn into the Magistus Calamity (Extra Deck-specific floodgate) or Vahram (fieldwipe of opponent’s face up cards).  If you want some immediate damage, you can equip Aiwass to Zoroa instead, giving you a 2500 ATK monster so you can hit over stuff like Winda with a normal summoned monster.  After sufficiently softening up your opponent, this deck can easily generate 8000+ ATK, especially with Awakening of the Possessed on the board. This deck features lots of free special summons with high attack monsters such as Iris Swordsoul, Lord of the Heavenly Prison, and the Extra Deck Charmer’s ability to resurrect your opponent’s monster. When the time is right with your field full of Charmers and charmed monsters, SWING FOR GAME!!!  &nbsp;  <span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span> <ul>  	<li>The side deck options offer an expanded array of choices to control the board. Fairy Tail – Snow was recently unbanned, but using her in this deck is almost impossible, as her summoning effect cannot be fulfilled easily. The Dogmatika package can be expanded to include Shadoll cards like Winda and Schism to add an extra power boost at the cost of extra deck slots. Potent field spells like Secret Village and Ichirin are usable with Terraforming, Metaverse and Set Rotation, offering extra control/floodgate control. Finally Emergency Teleport’s target, Ghost Ogre can synchro with another Level 4 Spellcaster to summon Fortune Lady Every, and very strong boss monster.</li>  	<li>Try to force out a simplified gamestate, where a grindgame is dominant. What this deck lacks in offensive power, it makes up for it in defensive control.</li>  	<li>This deck can OTK in a blink of an eye, since multiple monsters/attributes on board + Awakening of the Possessed usually generates 10000+ ATK on board.</li>  	<li>Force out with other cards your opponent’s interaction before using a particularly lethal trap that REALLY hurts your opponent – like Skill Drain (slaughters combo decks) and Ice Dragon’s Prison (banishes Eldlich to the Shadow Realm).</li>  	<li>This deck obviously prefers to go first. However, trap cards are surprisingly good at breaking apart established boards!</li> </ul> <span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span>  Okay okay I’ll admit it, I’m a big sucker and simp for the Charmers, and no matter what I do to help them out, they’ll always remain a casual deck, barely scratching the surface of becoming rogue. This is my personal strongest rendition of this deck using the tools made recently available, and they can actually hold their own versus even the top meta! Not convinced? Watch my Youtube video where Charmers battle Eldlich and Invoked/Shaddol, the Control Kings of the 2022 banlist! (forgive my lame ass video, I haven’t uploaded to Youtube for literal years. I'm gonna give a shot to Yugi-tubing casually, wish me luck!)  Seriously though, I love boosting up underpowered and overlooked decks to be able to stand their own ground versus meta, and it’s so utterly satisfying watching a magical girl strike down Eldlich with her astronomically high 3050 ATK! I hope you folks enjoy piloting this deck as much as I do! :)  GLHF Duelists!"

I've been tweaking it for a while, but here's what I play right now. The combos are all intuitive and complicated, so it takes lots of practice to be able to consistently play the deck well. One of the best lines is overlaying Copernicus and Gryphon into Caesar, and then linking off Caesar and another monster (usually Lamia) for Cross-Sheep. This will give you lots of material in grave because the pendulums won't get sent to the extra deck, and it will search Swamp King to trigger the Cross-Sheep with. With this deck, it's pretty important to manage your tuners. Most of your best end board cards are synchros, so you don't want to run out of Lamias. The Ghost is usually your Halqifibrax target. Your Gilgamesh targets are almost always Ragnarok and Apocalypse, unless you want a crazy pendulum summon play I guess. The dragon shrines are all for dumping Destrudo, which is a free extender. It can be used to make Dragster, Alexander, or Halq in a pinch, although you do have to be careful not to burn yourself out. I'm choosing to main deck Eternal Darkness, because I think the lock is a bit better than Patent License, but you can side Eternal Darkness out for it if that's better. The side deck and hand traps are flexible of course, but I think these are pretty good for this format. Enjoy!"

I then activate Numeron Network's effect to activate Numeron Calling, allowing me to Special Summon Numbers 1-4 on my field. If Memories of Hope is on my hand, then I activate it allowing me to draw 4 cards since 4 Xyz monsters are on the field. I then Xyz Summon Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya using Number 1 as Xyz material. Sunya's effect banishes all monsters on the field. If Swift Scarecrow is in my hand, then I do not summon any monsters for the rest of the turn, because Swift Scarecrow can be immediately sent to my graveyard if my opponent declares a direct attack. In doing so, the battle phase immediately ends, negating the direct attack. I then Special Summon Sunya during my next Standby Phase with it's effect. Then the opponent takes 1000 LP worth of damage for each of my banished monsters. If I have Foolish Burial Goods, then I use it to send a Numeron Network from my deck to my graveyard. I then activate one of my monster effects from cards such as Exiled Force, Unchained Twins Aruha, etc, to destroy my Chaos Gate Sunya, and send it to my Graveyard. I then activate Numeron Network's effect to send Numeron Chaos Ritual to my graveyard. This allows me to use any 4 Xyz monsters + Numeron Network in my graveyard or banished, to Xyz summon Number C1000 Numeronius. It gains 10,000 ATK if summoned this way.

Generally, you would probably play 2-3 Illusion of Chaos (You can probably go down to 1 or 2 Timaeus), I only pulled 1 and it's still worth running at 1 since it's super easy to search since you can use Soul Servant to top deck it and draw (which you can search for with circle and rod), then immediately activate it and just keep it in your hand forever grabbing whatever DM monster you want.  If you have the cards another Dragoon you can remove Dark Cavalry for it.  I generally side out Magician's Nav, Eye of Timaeus and one of the Timaeus Dragons for the general set of 2-3 cards that I would want depending on matchup."

Make sure to read my notes and watch the combos video. For f,"First, you can make changes to the Extra Deck to match the current Meta since Link Evolution misses cards. You can add Accesscode Talker, Baronne de Fleur and Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden in place of Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Ultimaya Tzolkin and Clara &amp; Rushka, the Ventriloduo.  Some cards in this deck provide means to play through interruptions. Fairy Tail - Snow can banish 7 cards from Hand, Grave and/or Field to Special Summon itself. Let's say your Tornado Dragon or Artifact Scythe is being negated, you can simply banish whichever is being negated and resolve the effect. You can send Fairy Tail - Snow to Grave through Timestar Magician. Fairy Tail - Snow can also be used to interrupt the 1st summon of the opponent.  You can also do the same with Time Pendulumgraph, but you need to have Timestar Magician on the Field. Using Time Pendulumgraph and Timestar Magician, we can play through 2 interruptions. Let's say Tornado Dragon is being negated by Infinite Impermanence (We need a card on your opponent Field for this to work), chain Time Pendulumgraph and activate its effect. Select 1 Pendulum card in your Pendulum Scale and Infinite Impermanence. Timestar Magician will then trigger its effect to protect the Pendulum card by sending 1 card to Grave and that card is Fairy Tail - Snow. Since only 1 card was destroyed, Time Pendulumgraph will activate its effect to send 1 card on the field to Grave, so send Tornado Dragon and that's how you dodge the Infinite Impermanence. Now, Artifact Scythe is on the field since Tornado Dragon's effect resolved. When Artifact Scythe tries to activate, let's say you opponent tries to negate it. Simply, chain Fairy Tail - Snow banishing 7 cards from Hand, Grave and/or Field including Artifact Scythe to dodge the negation once again.  Regarding the combo in Duel 1, instead of summoning a lvl 4 using Harmonizing Magician's effect, summon Oafdragon Magician and Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur instead of Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer. The link 1 is used to send Fairy Tail - Snow to Grave in the off chance she's your only summon, so you can use her as an interruption.  In the gameplay, I once opted to not use Astrograph Sorcerer's effect after I destroyed a card I control thinking I can add it using Oafdragon Magician (It can only add 1 face-up ""Magician"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" Pendulum Monster from your Extra Deck to your hand). The correct way would have been to Pendulum Summon, XYZ Timestar Magician, Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur OR XYZ Tornado Dragon, Link Astrograph Sorcerer with another card into Artifact Dagda and use Timestar Magician's effect to add Astrograph Sorcerer from the Extra Deck. Use Baronne de Fleur OR Tornado Dragon to destroy the scale (Don't protect using Timestar Magician) and Special Summon Astrograph Sorcerer from your hand and add a card from deck. The rest depends on your hand.  Props to Trif Gaming for the combos and the profile.  https://youtu.be/FTiH845roOY"

The P.U.N.K.'s are capable of going into things like Aurorodon lines and Baronne de Fleur, but I can't really afford that to a deck i'm taking to locals maybe once a month. That being said, they've got some fun synergies and I personally feel like VW can do more interesting things with the 2 slots missing from Desires and fill them with Small World lines. Amazing Dragon just cares about Psychics in Grave for it's bounce effect, not specifically P.U.N.K.'s.  First thing i would cut is the Sharakusai/Rising Carp for Halq setup."

Well look no further because Generaider is here (and has been for a while but let's not talk about that). This deck is one of those classic field spell centric decks that has zero way to play when the field spell is somewhere other than on board. But unlike those decks, you're running a huge amount of level 9s that really want to stay in deck for the deck to function. However, Generaiders have some extremely good support to make up for this inherent weak spot that makes them semi-consistent and an absolute king of the mid-game.  There are 9 main deck monsters in the archetype and really only 6 are worth talking about. Harr, Hela, Utgarda, and Nidhogg all have the usual Generaider effects where they tribute monsters for a beneficial effect. Harr is an omni-negate, Hela is a reborn, Utgarda is a targeting banish, and Nidhogg is a summon negate. Mardel and Loptr are a bit unique in the deck as Mardel is your search card when summoned and Loptr tributes any Generaider on board (including itself) for a level 9 Generaider from deck. Loptr is also the only normal summon in the deck, so all you Aleister fanboys can go wild. Naglfar, Frodi, and Dovelgus are all really really bleh compared to the rest, so don't run them unless you feel super confident in your ability to draw like Lithium when he plays Monarchs.  As for ratios of the main deck Generaiders, 3 Mardel and 3 Loptr is standard with one or two of the others depending on what you think you'll need in the deck. Trias Hierarchia is also a really good inclusion in the deck as it can tribute your Generaider tokens to summon itself on your opponent's turn. If you include that, run 2 or 3 copies as it is always online if you have access to the field spell.  Onto the spell cards, Boss Stage is the heart and soul of the deck. It kinda defines the whole playstyle of Generaiders, that being playing during your opponent's turn but in a cooler way than PSY-Frames could ever hope to achieve. It summons tokens during their turn that enable every Generaider to pop off, and it summons one from deck before doing so. Just the coolest field spell in the game in my opinion. Run three because you have to.  To find the field spell we have 7 additional backrow (plus Mardel) to find it. Terraforming is Terraforming and it just does Terraforming things. I'd run three if I could, but you kinda can't and probably never will be able to again. RIP in kill sweet prince. Boss Quest searches two Generaider spells and traps with different names for the low, low cost of putting a brick back in the deck. You run three and only ever three. Boss Fight activates Boss Stage from the deck or GY. It's like Metaverse but better. Run three. Boss Room is a really cool card that changes any activated effect into both players drawing one card. I usually run three, but with Boss Quest it's almost always accessible so you can run one or two instead.  The non-Generaider backrow is pretty self-explanatory. Pot of Avarice keeps you in the game longer than 11 turns which might not ever come up if the people you play against are always on combo decks, but I always end up playing against Dark Magician or Geist 90% of the time so it's nice to have this card in the deck. Kuji-Kiri Curse is an additional unbricking tool that also sets up Hela while drawing two cards. You can run Prosperity instead, but you do want your extra deck to help close out games. World Legacy's Monstrosity is an amazing card in the deck as it can either summon one level 9 from your hand or summon two from deck if you have one on board already. Other than just simply waiting for Boss Stage to activate a few times, this is how you get into the extra deck. Rank-Up Magic Argent Chaos Force is a bit of a sussy include, but I lost a game to geist while being 100 LP from winning, so this enables you to summon this deck's version of ""Cowboy for game"" being Number C9.  The extra deck is just every single good rank 9 you can run with some links to help with using Loptr as material when your deck is running low on cards. Heart-eartH is my favorite xyz monster in the game, and could absolutely be replaced by something better, but it's included here because I really like the card. Tachyon Dragon helps close out games with its skill drain effect. Enterblathnir is just really good answer to a lot of problem cards with its non-targeting banish. Dyson Sphere is good at cleaning up games by attacking directly (and then you can rank it up to really close out a game). Hyperyton brings even more negates to the party in the weirdest way possible. The Cat is another Hela but without the tribute cost. Jormungandr is technically the boss monster of the deck and can steal your opponent's resources to achieve big number.  The Knightmares are standard and don't need explaining. World Gears, however, is probably the worst deckbuilding choice I have ever made. If you summon this card, it clears the board, which sounds super cool. But Generaiders kinda want the board so they can build up advantage turn by turn and exhaust their opponent. Not to mention if you manage to get 3 level 9's on board, you can access the entire extra deck (except the chaos xyz cards) instead of a field nuke towers. It might be better than I make it out to be, but I've never had it work for me.  In the side deck, Lava Golem is a solid choice with how few normal summons the deck has. Kaijus might be better in most cases, but Enterblathnir can usually handle a single boss monster on its own. Raigeki is Raigeki and it's just better lightning storm now that it's unbanned. Cosmic Cyclone is a good answer to other spell reliant decks and Heavy Storm Duster does the same but while dodging Anti-Spell and Imperial Order (Not anymore though, get fucked IO). Imperm is just my favorite handtrap with how effective it is going first or second, but you can use any other hand traps you'd like.  This definitely isn't the best build of the deck out there, but I'm not a huge fan of mixing archetypes together so this is the best I can make while keeping it pure. You can add Girsu, Therizia, or Aleister and their engine cards to give the deck more normal summons and either extension or boss monsters, or use a Guru deck as the base and splash in Generaider if you're a streamer who's beyond high on copium. If you have any questions or suggestions, leave them below so I can try and improve the deck as best as I can."

It excels at playing through your opponent's disruption through the use of chain blocking. Your main starters are Black Metal Dragon, Starliege Seyfert, and Chaos Space. These cards can give you access to additional monsters while chain blocking your most important effects. For instance, if you have Black Metal Dragon and a Rokket monster in hand, you can use Black Metal Dragon to link summon Striker Dragon. Then, since both monsters' effects activate at the same time, you can decide what order they will occur in the chain. Your opponent will only be able to respond to the last card activated in the chain. By making Striker Dragon chain link 1 and Black Metal Dragon chain link 2, your opponent cannot use a card like Ash Blossom to negate your Striker Dragon's effect. Therefore, you can successfully add Boot Sector Launch and use it to summon the Rokket monster from hand. To play through interruption optimally, you will have to decide which effects to chain block based on what cards you have in hand and what situation you are in. Here are a few basic combos you can go through.  <strong>#1 Black Metal Dragon</strong>  Normal Summon Black Metal Dragon &gt; Link Summon Striker Dragon &gt; Activate Both Effects To Search Boot Sector Launch And Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon(RedMD) &gt;

The usual end board is spheres + hot red dragon archfiend abyss, spheres + borreload savage dragon, or sometimes all 3. Spheres functions as both disruption and a way to search levianeer by summoning brotaur off its second effect. By this point you will have already filled your graveyard with the necessary requirements to summon it when your opponent passes turn. It can then be used to help break the board they set up if they managed to play through your disruption.  Some things to keep in mind:  <em>*Rokket Tracer's effect will lock you into summoning dark monsters from the extra deck for the rest of the turn.</em>  <em>*Rokket Synchron's effect will lock you into summoning dark monsters from the extra deck for the rest of the turn.</em>  <em>*Black Metal Dragon is not once per turn.</em>  <em>*Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres can only activate its effect to return a card to hand while in an extra monster zone.</em>  <em>*When tributing itself for cost, Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres can resolve its effect to return a card to hand while under skill drain, because it won't be on the field during resolution.</em>  <em>*Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres does not target. You will choose which face-up card to return to hand when resolving its effect.</em>  <em>*Nibiru will trigger Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres effect to special summon a dragon from deck.</em>  <em>*Rokket Tracer's effect is a quick effect, so you can chain it to the activation of one of your spell cards, and destroy that spell card, to get both effects without having to sacrifice an additional resource.</em>  <em>*White Dragon Wyverburster and Black Dragon Collapserpent's effect to special summon themselves from hand is once per turn, but their effect to add each other is not.</em>"

Many of the games have a grind game of more than 5 turns so much more important than trying to OTK at all costs with this deck is to exchange resources efficiently which is very easy to do thanks to the absurd cards called <a data-name=""Mathmech Superfactorial"">Mathmech Superfactorial</a> and <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> that are a potential -3 to even -4 for the opponent counting the <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> omni negate. Not to mention that archetype XYZ monsters are excellent and even a little stolen when reading for the first time, <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> being a Searcher and Extender and <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> a <a data-name=""Trishula"">Trishula</a> that can be given on the opponent's turn. An interesting point about Mathmech's Extra Deck monsters is that they are generic and can be used in almost any deck. I myself am sure that someday there will be a deck to abuse Alembertian absurd effects when made with 3 materials or 4 materials.  /////////////////////////////////////////                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <strong>Decklist picks:</strong> The Mathmech archetype cards such as Synchro level 8, Equip's spell and Reborn's spell and Trap which is a pop don't do much for the deck and therefore are not part of the decklist. Generic Cyberse support like <a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a> and <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> are cards that take up consistency card slots and hand traps so in the end they don't do much for deck strategy. Cynet Mining <strong>doesn't have good discards</strong> in the deck and you don't need these cards to play Mathmech after all. ///////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Recommended cards:</strong> Mathmech's deck in the TCG enters this February format with a lot more consistency issues because of the <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> limitation and one card that can help the deck is <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talents"">Triple Tactics Talents</a> which is a very versatile card. Another card that I highly recommend using in the deck is <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a> because it's very easy to trigger its effect and clear the opponent's field by going second.  /////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combos: </strong>  This topic is not really a tutorial on how to play each specific hand, but plays I made with a random hand that I opened playing with the deck. It's a nice way to show the deck's proposal from where it wants to go, considering how you would start your moves and the play lines chosen. The important thing is to understand that this is a deck that does not tolerate errors during gameplay, so you should always be aware of the most efficient way to play. These examples that I show you along with the technoplay tips that I talk about after these combos are enough to get you started playing Mathmech.  As you can see these combos are narrations of how I played with a certain hand and how I behaved <strong>after taking interactions</strong> like hand traps and from the opponent's established fields as well. From the End Board you can see that the objective is to pass with the <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> trap along with <strong>3 Mathmech Monsters in the GY</strong> with different names including the <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> which turns the Xyz Mathmech into an <strong>omni negate</strong> as well. For this we use the <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> + <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> combo to access Link-2 <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> that adds the Diameter/Nabla needed to make the <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> that adds the Trap Superfactorial at the same time that it finishes the necessary names in the gy.

You always use the Balancer Lord effect from Extra Normal Summon and save to use only the normal summons of good cards that are the basics of the deck save the Normal Summons for the right cards.  <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> allows your Mathmech boss monsters to be omni negate to interact with the opponent or negate cards like Nibiru on your turn. Whenever you open it with Diameter you want to throw a monster in the gy to take advantage of its Normal Summon. So much so that even if you draw from Balancer Lord + Diameter, you doing this play do very well. However you have to analyze if your hand is too weak for interactions because in that case a negate in the <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> makes your turn end. You have to remember that <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> is guaranteed to search for negate so it is always safe to go straight to it with Diameter.  <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> is a fundamental piece to access the missing monster to make the Superfactorial alive in the opponent's turn, especially the Diameter but it can be <a data-name=""Sigma"">Sigma</a> if you already have access to the Diameter. If you open from Nabla and Diameter but you can't have a monster in the GY, the best thing is to use Nabla from NS and use eff SS Diameter from Deck and keep the Diameter in hand as Follow Up.  If you can use <a data-name=""Multiplication"">Multiplication</a>/Nabla as Xyz material on your next turn if you Tribute Xyz with the effect of Nabla or Alembertian it trigger eff to double ATK/Monster can make two attacks which is cool if the monster you make is <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> for example.  Important to know the right choices of how to start hand summons, see the details to have plays after interactions mainly going second.  When you open with RANK-4 Alembertian play and Extender you can start adding a <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> and then go to play Link Disciple and Devotee and Wicckid combo. But this is not an orthodox play and it might be good to first go to Wicckid turbo play to gain access to Diameter to ensure Alembertian will resolve and add Superfactorial. Primary Follow Up is adding Diameter and secondary is adding Nabla/Sigma.  Cool is that if you already open with <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a>, use Alembertian to add Extenders or Nabla to access Diameter and try to generate an advantage with Link Disciple and Link Devotee moves etc. If you can stop the opponent without having to use the Superfactorial, it's very good to leave it to use it <strong>only on your turn</strong> because in addition to the mini Trishula you get right at the beginning of the Diameter's negate turn to play safe your turn. You only activate on his turn with him doing nothing that threatens you if he sets a trap on the same column as the Superfactorial because it will most likely be an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>. Many times you want to play Accesscode Turbo and even then you don't have a chance to OTK it and so using two Superfactorial and two <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> is essential. It's important to understand that this is not an OTK deck so using the second trap in matches plus grind game is fundamental, looking at the gamestate and predicting the best move is essential in decks that are based on trading resources and for everything I've played with this deck you <strong>always take the game to a simplified gamestate</strong>.  Always try to play around <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> when you have <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> on the field because first you must use I:P Masquerena eff and if he negates with Droplets you will still have the Superfactorial summon Laplacian. If you take <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> in the Superfactorial eff on one of the 3 targets in the gy you will still be able to summon the other two targets and do the <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> at least to add a Follow Up and if you have the Diameter as material have an omni negate also. Only if the opponent banishes at least 2 targets from the Superfactorial that it doesn't resolve.  <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> does not trigger eff if <strong>MASTER DUEL</strong> game <strong>button is Off</strong>. If you are facing a deck that uses <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, summon Parallel eXceed in Attack Position because if your opponent uses Skill Drain the eXceed returns to 2k atk and at least you will have a monster with great attack to try to survive until you take the Skill Drain that can be done with even <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> using effect and banishing itself from the field as cost.  Of the Deck Extenders: <a data-name=""Addition"">Addition</a>, <a data-name=""Subtraction"">Subtraction</a> and <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> you should pay attention to the card details that first all of them <strong>lock you from Special Summoning Cyberse</strong> monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. Second that Sigma is the best extender of the 3 because it is searchable by Wicckid since it is Tuner and being able to come back from GY has the detail of being <strong>banned when leaving the field</strong> so the only way to not have it banned is to use it as xyz material but it doesn't make much difference to have him banned for his turn 1 combo to pass. Addition and Subtraction <strong>cannot declare an attack</strong> in the turn that are Special Summoned by their own effect and they can <strong>target opponent's monsters</strong> whatever better the deck to go second and break the field.  <strong>Against Decks Blind Second</strong> = This deck doesn't care about many of the cards used to break the field. For example <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> on monster doesn't affect the deck at all because of Wicckid and Laplacian and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> at best takes the interaction from I:P Masquerena only. <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> is another card that the deck handles easily. The best blind second card against Mathmech is the <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>.  /////////////////////////////////////////////  <strong>Technoplay cards of Extra Deck:</strong> <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> <strong>doesn't destroy the cards but sends them to the GY</strong> so you can take spells/traps out of the field on the protection of <a data-name=""Heavenly Sky"">Heavenly Sky</a> or the <a data-name=""Golden Lord"">Golden Lord</a> that came back from the GY by its own effect.  <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> on the Following turn is usually to add extenders to kill the opponent whether Sigma or Nabla bring Multiplication from the deck and do FINAL SIGMA or Accesscode Talker Turbo or continue controlling the game with Superfactorial.  *(Don't FORGET that <a data-name=""LINK DEVOTEE"">LINK DEVOTEE</a> has a MANDATORY Eff to ACTIVATE when he ENTERS the FIELD to LOCK you into CANNOT SUMMON LINK-3 or Higher) ***Place the <strong>tokens</strong> in the zones away from the Links arrows.  <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> protects Wicckid from being negated by Trap cards like Infinite Impermanence. Against backrow matchups they are insane too.  LINK-2 <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> is an absurd card that is a fundamental piece for the deck to spin and you access the cards you need to make your turn 1 setup and even generate follow up on your opponent's turn by activating <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> and bringing 1 of the Mathmech from gy in the zone it points to (it doesn't have to be the XYZ in Wicckid's zone to trigger its effect).  COOL INTERACTION: WICCKID + SUPERFACTORIAL = You don't need to bring XYZ to the field in the Wicckid zone, but the Reborn of the GY is one in the Wicckid zone and even then you in the new chain link can use Wicckid cl1 Laplacian cl2. As long as Wicckid is on the field you can generate plus and add Mathmech Tuners to the hand every turn. Wicckid <strong>protecting the Cyberse he points out from Destruction</strong> is also absurd. See what is really <strong>going to banish from gy as cost of Wicckid</strong> because you don't want to banish Mathmech level 4 monsters and if possible you want to also keep the Links in gy so that your Accesscode has multiple pops so if you have XYZ Alembertian and Laplacian at GY banning them is always free. A very interesting play is to use Wicckid's absurd effect in your favor when you open it going second to force interactions because if you do <strong>Wicckid with eXceed</strong> in your hand, you practically get to Accesscode without losing to cards that destroy, that is, guaranteed to force interactions .  It happens a lot to use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> to <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> on the opponent's turn in trap matches already to start your turn by destroying the opponent's backrow with an Accesscode of 4300atk that cannot be destroyed by effects. When opponent uses Dogmatika Maximus effect you always send I:P Masquerena + Unicorn to GY. (remember to keep a card in hand for Knightmare Unicorn - a very simple detail to remember for I:P Masquerena to work)  One cool thing about this deck is the ability to <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> with a lot of extra effects like Attack twice or Doubled ATK which is really good."

Blind 2nd, use handtraps and spell cards to outplay opponents.  &nbsp;  Reasons for <strong>NOT</strong> playing some of commonly played cards:  Infinite impermanence: Too many effect negations already, effect veiler, fobidden chalice, widow anchor.  Raigeki, lightning storm: Most monsters have floating effect or proections nowdays, these cards might sometimes brick you.  Pot of Avarice: This card sometimes brick, you cannot use it turn one.  Ghost belle, Droll &amp; lock bird, Ghost ogre, Gamma: Not generic enough, sometimes brick.  Call by the grave &amp; Shark Cannon &amp; Crossout Designator: Not all decks use monsters in graveyard, sometimes brick.  Upstar goblin: Chicken's game is better, sky strikers have a hard time OTKing opponent with more than 8K LP,  Accesscode &amp; 2 sky striker monsters can only output 8K damage.  Kaiser Colussum &amp; There can only be one: Mostly useless if not going first.  Foolish Brial Goods &amp; Metalfoe Fusion &amp; Toon table of content: Bricks more than it helps.

Harpie feather duster, other S&amp;T removal: If Eldlich didn't open skill drain and imperial order, these are not really needed.  &nbsp;  Reasons for playing some of the cards:  2 Nibiru: Not 3 by reducing chances of bricking, but high enough for opening &amp; maxx c into it.  2 Veiler: Not 3 because it might brick, need at least 2 for accesscode play.  Borrelsword: To beat off some ""unaffected by card effects"" boss monsters.  2 Pot of desires: Not 3 because, A, you don't want desires into desires, B, you can't really use 2 since you only have 40 cards in your deck.  Eagle Booster: Good for preventing OTKed by opponent, use it on accesscode and win next turn.  Imperial iron wall: Hurt most decks and help yourself.  Drytron: cannot use eva to +2. Tri-brigade: no banishing to summon &amp; link-4 removal. Gren-maju: dead. VW: shenshen effect useless. Eldlich: cannot go +1 off of traps in grave. Cyber dragon: cannot fusion summon. Invoked Shadoll: invoked summon play got hindered.  Generic: Stops accesscode, callby the grave and crossout designator, DD crow, Most Pots.

Ideally on turn 1 you want to bring out Bahamut Shark to detach a material and then summon Toadally Awesome. Having Defender of the Ice Barrier with another Ice Barrier monster on field is also great since it stops your opponent from declaring an attack (as long as their monsters have attack greater than 1600). On turn 2 you will want to summon out either Trishula Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier or regular Trishula to remove cards with its' non-targeting banishing effect. Usually, if my opponent has 3 or more cards I will try to summon Zero Dragon, and if they have only one card on the field I will summon out regular Trishula so I can also banish cards from their hand and graveyard too.  If you manage to draw Gozen Match on turn one then this is a great time to summon Number 4: Stealth Kragen from the Extra deck as it changes all monsters to the water Attribute. If your opponent does not play any water monsters this is especially effective, as they will simply be locked into the one monster that you have changed into water with Steatlh Kragen plus the effect of Gozen Match.  *I used a modified version of this deck to climb to Platinum in Master Duel. Since Toadally Awesome is limited to one on Master Duel I substitute the second Toad with Number 47: Nightmare Shark. I also cut 1 Prior of the Ice Barrier, Salvage and Upstart Goblin for 3 Maxx ""C"" since the extra draw power is absolutely incredible in this deck. If you can find other cards that consistently give you draw power I heavily recommend that you use them in this deck as they help it greatly, both in real life and in Master Duel."

It wasn't made with competitive play fully in mind so it will most likely struggle against the top meta decks. It was also done in Master Duel specifically so keep it in mind regarding some cards like Maxx C, you might want to change them depending on how and where you're using this.  That being said, some cards were added in the extra deck to make it more survivable like Isolde, Sunrise and Absolute Zero. One of the best combos is to summon Absolute Zero (preferably with Liquid Soldier as one of its materials to activate its effect too) and then Mask Change it to Masked HERO Acid. This will trigger Absolute Zero's Raigeki effect and Acid's Harpie's Feather Duster effect, wiping the opponent's field (provided you're able to do it without negation, of course).  • Don't be afraid to send Shadow Mist to the graveyard, but do be careful when you activate her effect in there. Do not special summon her from the GY on the same turn because you can only activate one effect per turn.  • If you ever use Liquid Soldier's effect to draw 2 cards and have to discard one, and you end up with both a ""Change"" card and ""Mask Charge"", discard the ""Change"" card, you'll be able to recover it immediately with Mask Charge (provided you also have a HERO in the GY).  • Contrast HERO Chaos is the ace of the Masked Heroes and you'll want it as soon as possible.  Any comments for improvements to it are welcome, but keep in mind the theme of the deck is to have every Masked HERO in it in tribute to Kamen Rider."

The problem, however, is the downside inherent in the Adventure engine:  during the turn you resolve Rite of Aramiser, you can't activate the effects of normal summoned monsters.  This is a big problem, considering so many of the classic Inzektor routes revolve around that first normal summon, not to mention the extra normal summon you get from Beetrooper Armor Horn.  Because of this I thought it was a bit disappointing that such anti-synergy exists, considering how much the deck would love to run the engine.  But then I thought maybe they still can.  Yes, there are some hands where you cannot use the brave engine and thus it's more or less dead.  But thanks to Zektrike, there are a lot of 3 or 4 card hands that could allow you to resolve the engine and play through your turn without relying on your Dragonfly or Centepede to be normal summoned, at least not to get effects from doing so.  Additionally, there are many hands where you draw the soft garnets to act as situational extenders.  Heck, there's no penalty for activating Enchantress, so even if your hand can't resolve the brave engine, perhaps just activating Enchantress is enough to make an antsy player burn their Ash.   The brave engine also makes it so even if your hand is utter crap, with no real way to get the Inzektor flow going, just opening Rite or Enchantress is enough to let you end on <em>something</em>.  I'm no expert in Inzektors or how well this would work out in practice, but I think it's at least worth testing out.  It's certainly a lot more interesting of a concept than simply replacing the 7 Adventure engine cards with 2 Crossout Designator + 1 of stuff I want to hate on, at least, and I think it should be less bricky too.  What are your thoughts on the concept and the deck ratios?"

Your opening plays will ideally start with you using Swirl Slime in the hand with Necro Slime to summon D'Arc, getting at least one other monster on the field (usually by normal summoning a Kepler for a search or a Lamia so you potentially get two uses out of her ideally), using Necro Slime in the gy to bring out Genghis, then linking away D'Arc and your other monster that isn't Genghis to bring out Gilgamesh, set your scales and use Genghis' effect to bring back your D'Arc. After this opening the deck can go in a few directions depending on what you have left in your hand or gy. Brining out Siegfried should be a priority since it's an easy spell/trap negate without an extra cost. Ghost is best used to send back your banished Necro Slimes to the gy by using it for Necro Slime's fusion, he's also a tuner."

Recycles spells and basically has infinite counter supply.  Servant of Endymion - Can bring out your negates by using 3 spell counters.  Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic - can basically wipe a field with it's pendulum effect by removing 6 counters. While it's a monster, it's untargetable, and can negate spell/traps  Beast King Jackal - Able to negate monster effects  Master Cerebus - Can search out Jackal and banish opponents monsters. Cannot be destroyed by card effects with 4 or more counters.  Spring of Mysterune - One of the most important card of the decks allowing you to draw 3 cards every turn and activate quick-play spells from your hand.  Point of Mysterune - Searches your cards and banishes your opponents top deck  Munnin - Searches deceit and can be used for link plays, can be used for health gain too  Geri - Recycles field spell and deceit. Also used for link plays or can be used defensively or to destroy monsters  Deck Goal:  Deck out opponent (agressive)  Build up counters and obliterate opponent(control)  -Always keep 1 quick-play spell in your hand if you already used your field spells effect unless in certain situations. You can then use your field spell to recycle more cards and get more quick-play spells on your opponents turn.  -If you plan on going agressive, you still have to play control. It's best to keep your quick-play spells in your hand if you are going this route. This way you can negate with your monsters on board and use your spells when you need them. Works best if your opponent is low on cards and you wiped their field.  -Will always loose to imperial order and has a very tough time against Flundereeze"

The Monsters  The main monster in the deck is Dinomorphia Therizia which sets any Dinomorphia trap from deck to the field.  In which you would set Dinomorphia Frenzy and if you already have Frenzy or Domain(Another less powerful Frenzy) you can set any trap needed according to the current game state.  The other Main Deck monster, Dinomorphia Diplos which sends a Dinomorphia trap to the grave to be used for their second effects, be able to recycle itself and Therizia, and or be used with Kentregina.  Both cards float upon destruction by banishing a any trap from GY.  Now the supporting cards. <ul>  	<li>Lord of the Heavenly Prison - To protect your traps and to help set up for next turn if SS(Both it and Ultimate Conductor can be used for an xyz monster)</li>  	<li>Miscellaneousaurus - To ensure the activation of your Main Monsters</li>  	<li>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno - A great last resort and Boss Monster if all else goes wrong(Both it and Heavenly Prison can be used for an xyz monster)</li>  	<li>Flowerdino - An extender and a way to recycle traps and get an extra Special Summon</li> </ul> The Spells  There are very few spells and great alternative spells that can be included.  Fossil Dig is a great way to search your Dinomorphia Monsters and if you already have one, to search Misc to ensure they cant be negated.  Pot of Extravagance to draw cards and set up for your opponents turn.  Then Called By the Grave because in a format with loads of Handtraps you need to be able to stop them.  Great alternatives and inclusions are <ul>  	<li>Pot of Prosperity(Other good draw card)</li>  	<li>Pot of Duality(Also a good draw card)</li> </ul> The Traps  Dinomorphia is a heavily Trap reliant deck to be able to control the game.  Cards like Dinomorphia Frenzy and <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Dinomorphia Domain.  Frenzy is to make Rexstrum and Domain to Make Kentregina and then use its effect to make Rexstrum.  Dinomorphia Brute, which is a non-targeting destruction that destroys your Dinomorphia and one card on their field(Which Dinomorphia is the easy winner cause it can float endlessly)  Dinomorphia Shell, which is a way to stop your opponent from attacking a low Atk Kentregina or Rexstrum by having the opponent have to attack it first.  Also it can be used in pair with Brute for a destruction(Though there wont be a floating effect).  Dinomorphia Sonic, which is just a Spell/Trap negate and destruction.  Lastly Dinomorphia Alert, which Special Summons two Dinomorphia monsters from your GY.  As well, all Dinomorphia Traps have a secondary effect to stop a dangerous situation with burn and attack damage.  Shell and Sonic for Battle damage, and Domain, Frenzy, Brute, and Alert for Effect damage.  Other traps include.</span> <ul>  	<li>The Solemn cards, which lessens your life more for more negates</li>  	<li>Hope for Escape, which is a great card for drawing more cards later in the game when your life is extremely low</li>  	<li>Skill Drain, oppressive floodgate that lowers your life by 1000</li>  	<li>Ferret Flames, a great card that bounces all monsters from the field until the combined attack is less then your life point(aka all of them later in the round)</li> </ul> Extra Deck  The Extra Deck is the place everyone will be different because there are so many diverse and good ways to make it, but everyone can agree that three Dinomorphia Rexstrum and Dinomorphia Kentregina is mandatory.  Rexsturm is the best card in the deck and is your main card to get out.  Rexsturm is a walking Skill Drain on legs that hits like a small planet(Hehe Hope for Escape planet joke ahahahahahahaha).  All monsters with less or equal attack to your life points are negated on the field, so DPE and Dragoon are useless and just there.  To help be able to use the effect, it has a second effect to half your life to make the attack of all monsters on the field equal to your life which can be used to otk and or to negate the entire field.  Dinomorphia Kentregina is a monster that halfs your life to imitate a trap in the GY by banishing it.  It has a base attack of 4000, but it never will have 4000 attack.  How it works is that it loses attack up to your life points, so if you have 4000 Life points it has 0 attack, 2000 Life points it has 2000 attack, and so on.  Dinomorphia Stealthbergia, which makes it so if your Life points are under 2000 trap cards that cost life no longer cost life to use, so Solem Strike and Skill Drain can be activated even if you dont have enough Life points to activate it.  Stealthbergia can be at any card limit, but two is the most reasonable in my opinion.  The rest of the Extra deck is heavily customizable.  In my list the Extra Deck monster are. <ul>  	<li>Evolzar  Dolkka, which is a great Monster negate and destruction.</li>  	<li>Evolzar Laggia, which is a great Spell negate and destruction.</li>  	<li>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max, which is a way to get game(EVERYONE WOULD KNOW IT WAS A JOKE.  COWBOY FOR GAME IS FOR THE PAST, WE ALL KNOW STALLING FOR TIME AND GUSTAV FOR GAME IS THE NEW ERA).</li>  	<li>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe, a big monster to put on Gustav Max for otks.</li>  	<li>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, a way to just wipe boards after attacking with any of the xyz monsters</li>  	<li>Knightmare Phoenix, a Spell/Trap removal cause you could never have enough removal cards.</li> </ul> Yet just cause I use these cards doesnt mean you have too.  Other great Extra deck Monsters include <ul>  	<li>Abyss Dweller</li>  	<li>Diagusto Emeral</li>  	<li>Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</li>  	<li>Tornado Dragon</li>  	<li>Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula</li>  	<li>Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</li> </ul> There is probably more but those are the ones I considered the most when deck building.  For all those who did read this Thank you and I hope you have as much fun with this deck as I will.  If you wanna support me I have a Twitch and YouTube and I might start streaming regularly and post Deck profiles and other fun videos."

Sick to the stomach after playing against Eldlich? Then this might be THE zombie deck for you...,"Mayakashi is my favorite archetype, so seeing decks listed as ""Mayakashi"" decks with loads of other non-Mayakashi cards in them drives me up a wall. Mayakashis don't need to be paired up with other archetypes like Shiranui or Eldlich (*vomits*) to be <em>good</em>, they can whoop ass all on their own - and here's my deck to prove that. Pretty much every card in this deck is all about helping you combo into your big Mayakashi boss monsters. Will update this deck over time especially when those Mayakashi support cards come over from the OCG to the TCG.  -Leo  <strong>v2.0 Changes </strong>  I added a side deck! This strays a bit away from pure Mayakashi bc it involves putting some Danger! cards into the deck. Replace the Uni-Zombies and 1 Dakki if you want to slot the dangers in, and swap the Sunsaga for the Skillsaga. Dangers work pretty great with Mayakashi- they aren't held back by the summoning restrictions, and make your opponent send cards to your GY for absolutely free. Also in the side deck are two copies of Solemn Strike, just in case you need extra negates."

Dragonmaids are used as an all around good engine, but also to disguise what the deck is capable of. If the opponent uses their disruption on the Dragonmaids, they are more vulnerable to a Fallen of Albaz.  On a Dragonmaid start, the deck may play like a typical Dragonmaid deck and end the turn on a Sheou. It is also capable of linking up to Accesscode Talker and bringing out a Borreload Savage Dragon later.  On a Windwitch start, the turn ends on a Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon. From here there's a fun detour to take if you have your single copy of Magicalized Fusion, where you can bring out one of the spellcaster link monsters in order to summon Quintet Magician. He's nothing crazy, but the fact that he can't be Kaiju'd or fusioned away makes me happy.  On a start where you have access to Fallen of Albaz, you just feel out how the opponent will try to disrupt you, bait it out if you can, and then fusion their best monster away with Albion the Branded Dragon, Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, or Mudragon of the Swamp. Super Polymerization will also allow you to summon Albaz and then use Sprind the Irondash Dragon on your opponent's turn to use any one of the opponent's effect monsters as fusion material."
