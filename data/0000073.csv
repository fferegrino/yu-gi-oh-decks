Most monsters have rather high attack power and you are capable of doing all summons although pendulum summoning maybe difficult. It has some very unique but powerful card combos and prides itself on its level 8 monsters. It includes odd-eyes dragons and very mainstream magic and trap cards that prove useful in most if not all situations. It's an over all powerful deck that is made to crush your opponent with overwhelming force no matter how low your life points are.

The new supports for Machina making it interesting to play and experiment. This deck focusing on the control aspect of the archetype while having big beaters. Not only Inspector Boarder is a great stun/floodgate (whatever the term is), it also fulfills the requirement of Machina Overdrive to summon other Machina from deck, notably Machina Citadel (or Colonel).

No more explanation needed as it is a backrow heavy control deck with typical set 5 pass, but there is some interaction that you need to pay attention to. You can summon Machina Fortress from hand/GY even if you have Boarder face-up, Machina Overdrive can both use Boarder as fodder or recycle it from GY/banished, Machina Air Raider and Irradiator cant summon monster with higher level than the fodder they used (cant summon Citadel if theyre using themselves as fodder), also both cant be summoned while Boarder is face-up, Machina Reformation best target is Irradiator + Megaform as it can fetch Citadel from deck  (doesnt draw, so it goes well with Extravagance)."

Trickstars great archetype, of course shows its full class with 3 x ""trickstar light stage"" and with 3 x ""terraforming"". But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

","The “Flame Warrior” gemini mish-mash is one of the most versatile decks I have shown so far. The deck has access to link 2’s such as Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights, Crystron Halqifibrax/Needlefibre, and Predaplant Verte Anaconda. As a result with any creative use of warriors, tuners, Dark Law and the accursed “ocg destroyer” (aka Dragun) can make you laugh while your opponent shits and cries. Gemini Abalation can be used to make that good turn one board into a god tier turn 3 board with creative use. Also the equip madmen of Yugioh that still play Vylons will have a grand time with the right build.

A sort of complicated combo toolbox, where the goal is to loop through Saryuja, ending on big board states that differ depending on the matchup.

So for starters, we have some interaction. 2 Ash, 2 Crow, 2 Droll, and 3 Called. I like this split, since there is incidental value in Droll's attribute and Crow's type, and with Saryuja the deck can often pick and keep the right-hand trap for the situation.

For the maindeck engine we have 3 Seyfert as well as Black Dragon and White Dragon. It's basically a one card link 2 on the low end, and they can also serve as extenders in games where Saryuja summon REDM.

For Rokkets we have 3 Tracer, 2 each of Magnarokket and Silverrokket, and a Recharger, which can be an amazing extender in some games, working as a virtual Monster Reborn for an extra REDM effect. Absorouters come with the package, they're free special summons, Sangans, and graveyard effects that search. Very useful card, which makes a lot of the boss monster possible, particularly Borreload Savage.

Black Metal Dragon is a Sangan for Darkness Metal, very useful for being another 1 card link 2 (low-end). Sometimes this can be an extender, when you're summoning REDM off of Saryuja and using Espy to start your Black Dragon/White Dragon loop by finding Seyfert.

Destrudo is obligatory, its a free dragon Special Summon, the only graveyard dragon worth talking about that can be lower than level 4 easily, life points don't matter. This card makes things possible.

Tempest is an interesting one. It searches REDM with Droll, which is relevant. It also helps make rank 8 Xyz Monsters, puts easy damage on the table, and works as a fairly generic link extender too.

Chaos Dragon Levianeer gives us a way to snipe hands, and also make rank 8 Xyz. The deck is mostly dark dragons with some light, so the best 2 effects are on the table here.

Galactic Spiral Dragon makes rank 8s easily, and is another easy cheap extender, particularly good out of the graveyard.

For Spells we have one Boot Sector Launch and one Dragon Ravine. You could run 2 Boot Sector Launch, but it feels bricky to me with all the searching. If you do run a third Striker to search it - you still often need 2 to full combo.

Dragon Shrine and Foolish Burial pitch Dragons into the bin. Super useful cards, my favourite play is to pitch Absorouter Dragon to search, then banish it for White Dragon. But these are super useful for making Titanic Galaxy, or even just pitching Destrudo.

Boot Sector Launch is a clear 3 of. It's a special summon out of the deck, with a lot of relevant targets (mostly Tracer) and very few (no) relevant restrictions. There's also a single Dragon Ravine, basically a searchable Foolish Burial.

Dragon's Mirror, the card I always forget about. This card is a one-card Pankratops that you can play going first, that also works as a combo extender out of the GY, and is bigger and a Dragon. Borreload Furious needs to see way more play IMO.

Lastly, we have 1 Monster Reborn. Low-end this card is worse than the Guardragon spell, but can still be relevant for getting you rolling. But its real place is to extend Darkness Metal combos.

I've already gushed about Borreload Furious Dragon, but it bears repeating - the card is powerful. Sometimes just being that extra special summon + a summon out the GY lets you end on some pretty insane boardstates out of otherwise low-end hands, and its also just a beefier Pankratops on the low end.

Borreload Savage is our Omni-Negate of choice. It's nice making him with two monsters. Remember, in most situations you should be holding onto Tracer to fire him off and make this at the last minute or near to it.

I've swapped Dingirsu out for Draco Berserker. The deck needs a good generic level 8 Synchro for low end plays, and I've found myself A) making Number 38 easily once I learned the loops, and B) making Number 38 more often. Dingirsu is good, space is just tight.

Number 38 looks to be the best Dragon Rank 8 Xyz, which becomes relevant thanks to Pisty and Elpy. It lets us set up boards that are resistant to Super Poly, since you can end on mostly Light Monsters and still feel pretty good about yourself. It's another Omni-Negate, which with tight play (and a couple extenders) can be put up beside Borroload Savage. You can also believably play around Nibiru with this card and others, and negate Evenly and Lightning Storm, meaning we're worried about Dark Ruler explicitly and not a lot else. I added this card just to cover the deck's niche weaknesses, and so far it's easier to summon than I expected.

For Links we have 2 Striker, 1 Romulus, to search field spells. You're often using both of these field spells on the same turn, but you're also surprisingly often shuffling them back into the deck with Saryuja, (basically, given all the searching) to use the increased hand size to find extenders or keep hand traps. Romulus CAN special summon monsters when you link climb Pisty and Elpy under it - while it's usually better to hold back, the ability to link them away after firing off Rokket Tracer (or even use them as Synchro or Xyz material still) does come up. The card is a headache for decision making, but it is very good. Usually, just keep the D.D. Crow or Tracer in your hand.

Saryuja is basically what the deck is built around. Just having that level of card selection makes it easy to put up the right lines of interaction for the right matchup, and you can blindfire him and feel pretty good about hitting a level 4 monster or Quick Launch. Pisty and Elpy are essential to this engine - all of these arrows work really well. You can resurrect this with REDM to make easy Link-4s.

We'd be running Borrelsword anyways, for the OTK potential, but it's worth noting its arrows are well placed for Pisty and Elpy loops out of Romulus and Striker Dragon. That's basically all Striker is here for, he's a good emergency link-3 that's easy to make and helps clear your board up to help make better states, and gives us outs in multiple situations. Also, the negation effect is super good occasionally.

Borreload Dragon is a good way to snipe Monsters with protection, not all protection, but enough, and a beastly boss monster. Being harder to remove than Borrelsword actually makes it the go-to going first, especially since its ability becomes non-targeting sending to the GY with Magnarokket (both do this). This might actually be the cut for Borrelend Dragon when it comes to the TCG, sad to say. But maybe not. The card is good.

Unchained Abomination is more Spell-Speed 2 removal, and is particularly relevant in back-row matchups, but is also notable for just being an easy-to-make advantage engine.

Hieratic Seal is super easy to make, and offers one line of interaction on its own, plus fodder for your Borrel boss monsters to do their thing. It also make Abomination triggers easily (by searching Tracer), alongside non-targeting sending, and stealing, and beating over, and oh-so many destruction effects... If you get lucky you might even have some hand traps, and if you play it right you'll have a field spell when you need one.

I like this deck.

No Apollousa, because she's not dark or a dragon. Every time I try her I find her almost impossible to summon.

I'm trying Upstart Goblin in a flex slot, since I like running 39 cards more than 1 special summon (I think)."

Behemoths, Oh ya.","This is a deck I've been testing that focuses on more the behemoths and bricking less with them.

Your main starts are either Hidden City + Guru or Archer due to their ability to get a big boy to your hand or straight to the field.
A few wild support cards I found to be pretty hand is Burst Rebirth, Trap Trick, and Pot of Forbidden (PoF). Rebirth allows you send a behemoth or pot to the grave and get it back at 2k LP which is steep yes, but the amount of times I had this card face down to revive like Ultra, PoF, or Umaster flipped games for me. Trap trick allows to search almost all the traps in the deck. PoF is a strong flip card that can be sent by Glacier or Succession and revived with Rebirth is a good start to turns or stopping plays if your opponent doesn't plan for it, but it is a major brick in the hand."

One deck was the Advanced Crystal Beasts Deck and the other one was a Sacred Beasts Deck very similar to the one Kagemaru used against Jaden except with additional Sacred Beast Support. This one is based on the Sacred Beast deck she used while controlling Jesse Anderson. Yubel received new support for her Sacred Beasts Anime Deck and i incorporated the new support into this deck.

first of all thank you in advance for your comments and ideas - the development of the deck strategy is still in progress.

With the first release of the Time Thief archetype and them being common I thought I'll collect them anyways. At this moment I had no idea what to do because there wasn't a Lv.3 monster for E-Tele.

About two weeks ago with the IGAS Set release (new Time Thiefs!) another interesting archetype appeared - Plunder Patroll! I like vikings and their artwork is kinda cute so I started collecting them. And with them relying on a permanent trap card I guessed this is pretty balanced and could be the stuff for interesting duels.

The Invoked archetype is something I learned to love while playing Duel Links. So I decided to open some booster and give it a try. Maybe this will change because way back in 2014 I played a Spirit deck with generic Lv.4 support when xyz ""swarming"" was still a thing (which will be again with Master Rule 5 I guess), so the Invoked will make room for some old friends like Kagetokage.

So I have this old Spirit Deck of mine in mind, collected the Lv.4 Time Thief cards (and their spell/trap support) and apparently the Plunder Patroll Main deck monsters are also Lv.4 - it struck me like lightning and the deck idea was born. I brought them all together and spiced them with some modern Lv.4 support like Perfomages (and other stuff you can take a look at in my deck list).

And this is where you guys come in - I would like to thank you in advance for your comments and ideas about this moment of insanity of mine, because I want to cap the card count around 40. Hint: in my oppinion Redoer is still boss of this deck."

Surely, this TeleDad Orcust is not as consistent as Junk Orcust, but it allows for more aggressive plays with DaD. I've decided to use Stardust Dragon as my Synchro monster, which is the classic choice for TeleDad, as it gives you a little more protection. Other viable choices are Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend for a nuke-play and Borreload Savage Dragon if you plan to use emergency teleport in later game states, when you already have linkmonsters in your graveyard. Of course, you could also play multiple synchro monsters, but I've found that Extra Deck space is too sparce for that.

This deck has two perfect starting hands:

1: Dark Grepher; D-HERO Malicious; Emergency Teleport; Dark armed Dragon; Orcust Cymbal Skeleton. This Hand lets you go into a Dingirsu with one XYZ-                    Material, a Stardust Dragon, a Dark Armed Dragon and a D-HERO Malicious on your field in your first turn. So two proctections, three bodies and the Malicious can      be used for a link play in your next turn. Personally, I recommend destroying one or more of your opponents cards with DaD first and then linking the DaD, Stardust      Dragon and Malicious into a BLS - Soldier of Chaos in your second turn.

2: Orcust Brass Bombard; Orcust Cymbal Skeleton; Orcust Knightmare; Dark Grepher; The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch. This Hand lets you set up your      field for a True King of all Calamities summon in your opponents turn, which will lock them out of their Monster effects.

But as is common with Orcust Decks, most hands will let you end your turn on atleast a Dingirsu with one XYZ-material.

Control your opponent like a puppet with this unique archetype, using Spells & Traps in order to g","So Konami have been going on a rather <em>interesting </em>announcement rampage. We have gotten support cards for three different archetypes - all announced in one day - alongside alternate artworks, new sets, etc. And my-oh-my, this is one that will certainly get some heads turning. Eldlich is brand new Spell and Trap-heavy archetype introduced in the Secret Slayers set. It's based on the myth of The Golden City - known famously as El Dorado. However, this isn't your standard Zombie Control-type deck. These new set of cards revolve around keeping card advantage: and getting as many cards as you possibly can to the grave in order to keep on plussing. So with my semi-brief synopsis out of the way - here's the card-by-card;

Now before any of you bat an eye and simply click away, this deck definitely has potential. There are many ways you could play this  - and it's all unique to the person (to some extent). The actual archetype itself can be split into three sub-categories: Eldlixir, Golden land, None of The Above. The thing that makes Eldlich stand out from other decks is its functions. Every card in the archetype besides Cursed El Dorlando can only function if the main monster is on board. This is a simple feat to overcome, as Eldorichie can special summon himself off-of his own effect. As for each category: the only thing you really have to note is each specific effect the cards have. Eldlixir of Red Splatter and Black Awakening both special summon a zombie monster; one from the hand or deck, the other from the graveyard. When they are banished, they can set a Golden Land card directly to your field. This is very dependant on your situation as, again, there are more than one type of Golden Land card. One of them is an archetype-specific Infernity Barrier - that in summary - gives you a free negate. The rest are all continuous trap-monsters. The ideal thing about the Eldlixir cards is they're non-specifications. You can easily end boards such as Vampire Sucker, Jack-O-Bolan, Eldorichie and a Balerdroch in grave for your opponent turn. Many people have started running Pot of Extravagance in the main deck: but I believe Magicians' Souls is simply more optimal in this situation. You a) get a free monster that, in tandem with Zombie World, becomes fodder for Vampire Sucker b) allows you a free draw 2 for the cost of spell/traps c) lets you use said spell/traps for more extending. The aim is always have advantage in hand-size but also board presence. You rarely use the extra deck - so I've sort-of tailored it to my preference. If you wish to change feel free to do so. The only cards I'd recommend keeping are Vampire Sucker at 3, Needlefiber and PSY-Framelord Omega.

Overall: this deck is a 8.1/10 for now. We are <em>very</em> early into its release so it's hard to tell how this deck will face under the format. For now - I can see it doing rather alright. Definitely a considerable opponent in the rogue tier. It introduces a weird, but somehow refreshing way of playing zombies and - at least in my opinion - is the best one out of the Slayer Three so far. The only major downside is El Dorlando and Adelantado being unsearchable. Perhaps if their name was changed, this deck would be more of a honourable foe. Nonetheless, I hope we will get more quirky archetypes like these in the future. I'd like to see the direction Konami will take us..."

Welcome to the only deck that can consistently set up negates without the use of a Normal Summon. Crus,"Servant to 1 - big deal! Electrumite gone - he was holding me back! Master Rule 2020 - who cares?! Pendulum is a deck that will, sadly, never die out. Good luck to all the Trif Gaming haters! With it's incredible power to completely shut off your opponent, and still OTK the next turn, there's no wonder that decks like Endymion make it to PPG feature matches (or even YCS top eights!). That's why I think it would be an appropriate time to show-off my Endymion build and prove to everyone just how powerful this deck can be - provided you read every wall of text that each card has to offer.

Something that first surprised me when making this adapted version of pendulum: is the Spellbook engine. It was always something prominent in the deck, but it has managed to expand now due to the constant need of getting counters on board. I've seen a lot of builds opt. for two Magician of Prophecy - which works just fine! However, since this deck is kind of tight on space, one is all I recommend you play. The reason behind this is that you always want to make Crowley before setting up your final board - this is easily achievable so don't sweat it. What he allows you to do is search out either one of your three Spellbook cards, so pray your opponent misses the Knowledge. If, for some odd reason, you manage to get the knowledge in hand but you don't have any targets - you run an Aleister the Invoker of Madness. He's can be used as a pitch-target, but he's also just a generic link-2 (which comes in handy way more often than you think).

People feared that the deck was dead due to Servant's sorrowful slandering that the banlist brought. But that's simply not the case. There are a plethora of ways to get him into your hand: albeit situational or not. Cards like Abductor, Mythical Institution, Spell Power Mastery and even hard-drawing the card itself are all a way to ensure you open full combo with the card. Speaking of Abductor - pendulum summoning him is no longer something necessarily bad. As we all know, SPYRAL is a deck roaming around the metagame recently, and so people are playing handtrap galore. Notably of course, Droll &amp; Lock bird. As I said my friends - reading the biblical scriptures that are pendulum cards could save you games. Thanks to that little bit of bottom text on the cards effect - you can search your Droll &amp; Lock bird straight from the deck if you have enough Spell Counters. Try Sleeper-ing that Michael State!

Overall: this deck is outstanding! It's interesting to see how a deck morphs due to the conditions it is in. I tried drawing some inspiration from other duelists playstyles, because there's simply so many ways of playing pendulum. In my opinion this deck is a 9.8/10. It can rely on its negates with ease - and never really falls flat when your board is broken. All it takes is drawing that one Chronograph Sorcerer and bam! You have another free negate on board plus a 2000 attack beatstick/fodder. Jackal King outs Nibiru. Secret Village outs spell-heavy decks. Mighty Master negates traps. Reflection spins problematic cards. There's simply so many things you can do with a deck this versatile! I'll definitely be trying it out in real life, and hopefully you take a shot at playing it too! Daddy Trif would be proud..."

Just 2 Drivers and 1 Multi-threader, for more consistency. Pankratops it's just a really good card, 2600 ATK so you can try destroy something in BP and then blow it up to destroy something else and you get the field empty to activate the Frame-gears.

Cardcar D to even more consistency. A good normal summon that gives draw power and leaves the field empty.

Cyberse Gadget, Witch of the Black Forest and Summoner Monk are the Lvl 4 monsters to go to Time Thief Redoer, Psychic monster that can trigger Lambda's effect, it can banish itself for and empty field and use the Frame-gears, and is a good monster in general.

Summoner Monk is viable, the deck has 16 spell cards. Witch of the Black Forest effect can search the Frame-gears, Pankratops, Cyberse Gadget and Cardcar D. Only one Ash Blossom, the deck already has plenty of hand traps.

Lambda's materials to link summon make it perfect to use mind control in the deck. Only 1 Psychic Feel Zone, to not brick with multiple copies. Mystic Mine, a card that some decks still have problems with and it gives you some time.

Because Psy-Frame Overload banish itself from the GY, you can play PK Shane Brigandine as a level 4 monster for Redoer. By playing that Metaverse is no longer an option.

Sky Striker Widow Anchor, good card and with 15 other spell cards sometimes it can use the second effect and you get another material for Lambda."

This version is really versatile and can go first with card like Bagooska and Abyss Dweller but it shines going second with a good R4NK Toolbox and your insect desruptions.

The side deck is still on work as it is a bit expensive but the core of the deck is really budget as you can build it all with 50$ and top locals (someone recently got regional tops with a version of this).

It's good especially for OTKs but it do well in grind games too with resource cycling and Kaijus even in game 2 and 3.

In Master Rule 5 with all the XYZ Spam you'll do in Main Phase 2 it will be even better.

Have fun!"

-That shopkeeper from the Season Zero movie

====================================================

Joey Wheeler might not be the most competent character to ever grace the animated series. Didn't exactly stop me from admiring his odd antics, not to mention getting weirdly interested in his archetype and somehow fitting something around it for this day and age.

Before you lies a Red-Eyes deck featuring a combination of various Red-Eyes monsters, Gemini monsters, arguably the best Red-Eyes Fusion monster aside from the one that's basically an auto-win, and a certain Link monster that's likely inevitably going to cost a fortune upon coming stateside. It's more of a fun and casual sort of deck, though it is fun to take up against certain big boy decks and enact some beatdown there.

&nbsp;
<h2>Monsters</h2>
<a data-name=""Red-Eyes B. Dragon"">Red-Eyes B. Dragon</a>, the one, the only. The much less revered (and reprinted/supported) counterpart to the one Dragon Normal monster Konami just loves to milk dry. I don't necessarily hold it against you for playing either, I personally feel some of the few notable Blue-Eyes cards include Alternative and Chaos MAX. Still, this red guy's one job is pretty much fodder for certain special summons and even a certain other kind of card that we'll get to later. The main one in question is...

A very big part of the deck in one way or another, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Alternative Black Dragon</a>. This card is basically a free summon provided other Red-Eyes monsters are in your hand. Any one will do. Regardless of level or type, so long as ""Red-Eyes"" is in the name, feel free to use it to bring this guy out. More often than not, you'll likely Link or Xyz it away into something better, but on the rare occasion it's destroyed thanks to your opponent's efforts, you get to Special Summon a Red-Eyes monster from the grave. If it just so happens to be Red-Eyes B. Dragon, its ATK doubles to act as a pretty good beatstick to get around certain situations. You'll likely go for some of the more powerful ones instead, however. Speaking of...

Though not really a strong monster on its own, <a data-name=""Black Metal Dragon"">Black Metal Dragon</a> is one of the monsters to help tie the deck together. It can be easily brought out with <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, otherwise you can equip it to a Red-Eyes monster to give it 600 extra ATK. Its second effect is arguably better, though. By sending it from the field to the grave, for example, by the effect of this deck's boss monster or by using it for a Link Summon like <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> (who pretty much solely exists in this deck for this exact purpose) or the other really good Link in this deck, it lets you search any Red-Eyes card from your deck, including a monster or backrow, essentially acting as a Candina or Time Thief Winder for the deck.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Wyvern"">Red-Eyes Wyvern</a> is a monster that's really only good in the grave, which it can easily be sent to by the effect of Insight or Alternative. Once there, if you didn't perform a Normal Summon during your turn, you get to banish it and Special Summon a Red-Eyes monster from the grave. Once again, any monster with the two specific words in its name will do, so no need to be picky.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Retro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Retro Dragon</a> makes for a surprisingly good handtrap in a way. Should any Red-Eyes monster, or monsters, of yours at L7 or below be destroyed your opponent's attack or card effect and hits the grave that way, you Special Summon Retro Dragon in defense from your hand, then revive all the Red-Eyes monsters destroyed by that attack or effect from the grave like nothing happened to them. Can you say, ""Retro Dragon's first effect: Bites the Flame!"" Yeah, erm, I'm going to hell for that Jojoke, aren't I?

Despite being a Fiend, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning"">Red-Eyes Archfiend of Lightning</a> couldn't fit this deck better. It's a beefy monster that normally requires one tribute to bring out at 2500 ATK, but c'mon. This is 2020, do you really see people outside of True Draco or Ancient Gear Tribute summoning anymore? No, no, you're gonna bring this out with any of your Red-Eyes supporting cards or effects! And once you do, you can likely normal summon it to achieve the wonderful effect of essentially unleashing a Raigeki upon your opponent's monsters if their DEF is lower than Archfiend's ATK. It almost feels like stealing, but man is it satisfying to nuke some monsters that would swarm you otherwise.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon</a> is another Gemini, with the exception being it can be used for effects that specifically call for a L7 Red-Eyes in the place of B. Dragon. That's not to say its effect once Gemini'd isn't trash, though. Battling with it period will almost always net you a free 2400 damage against your opponent come the end of the Battle Phase, just enough to chip them off in some cases.

<a data-name=""Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact"">Meteor Dragon Red-Eyes Impact</a>'s effect basically defends all your other Red-Eyes monsters from destruction while on the field, even though it's mostly just fodder for another really good Extra Deck monster you might bring out now and again.

Arguably one of the best Dragons in the deck is none other than the so-good-it's-limited <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>. By banishing a Dragon that's already done its job, it Special Summons to the field and revives a Dragon from your grave once per turn. Geez, this deck can really revive is key components easily, huh? Not much else to say, just a really good card for these kinds of decks to run.

&nbsp;

The next two monsters are primarily used for fusion material of this deck's boss monster, and they can be swapped out with any of the Warriors in the Side Deck to support your tastes. These are just two I personally enjoy for their individual utilities.

&nbsp;

<a data-name=""Phoenix Gearfried"">Phoenix Gearfried</a>, on his own, may just seem like another unnecessary support card for a card that got like, only so many clutch moments in the anime. But believe me when I say after it's been revived and Gemini'd, its ability to revive Geminis in the GY upon activation of an opponent's Spell, and as far as I can tell it's not a once-per-turn thing. It can also come in clutch in tandem with this deck's boss monster while it has cards equipped, letting you counter your opponent's backrow that targets monsters. Surprisingly useful, at least in my eyes.

You might also be wondering, ""Chupi, now why in the heck are you running <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Blazeman"">Elemental HERO Blazeman</a> in this deck if you've already made your own personalized deck profile of HEROes long ago?"", at least initially. Not only does it make for good material, but when it's revived from the grave upon your boss monster's destruction, you get to add <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> to your hand, just in case you need an extra fusion card for stuff you don't necessarily wanna pay LP with or have to wait after setting for the right moment to snipe some of your foe's monsters to make your own. You can forego this and add in another copy of say, Twin Twisters or Lost Wind, but I kinda like the added utility of this monster particularly.

The other Warrior materials you could use, <a data-name=""A/D Changer"">A/D Changer</a>, <a data-name=""Amazoness Swords Woman"">Amazoness Swords Woman</a>, <a data-name=""Fortress Warrior"">Fortress Warrior</a>, <a data-name=""Big Shield Gardna"">Big Shield Gardna</a>, <a data-name=""Guardian of Felgrand"">Guardian of Felgrand</a>, and all of them all have their respective niches, so you can go ahead and swap those in if you'd like.
<h2>Spells/Traps</h2>
<a data-name=""Cards of the Red Stone"">Cards of the Red Stone</a> immediately stands out among the spells of the deck, and is pretty much the reason to run a bunch of L7 Red-Eyes monsters. Using it and subsequently discarding one of these monsters lets you draw twice, then optionally send a second L7 Red-Eyes to the grave. In a way, it's like a <a data-name=""Destiny Draw"">Destiny Draw</a> and <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine</a> rolled into one.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Insight"">Red-Eyes Insight</a> is a must-run-at-three. Not only does it let you send any Red-Eyes card from your hand or deck to the grave, setting up their grave-reliant effects later on, but it also lets you search for any Red-Eyes backrow you want. Any one. Take your pick, aside from the dedicated fusion card if you still want to have your important summons take place and subsequently the boss monster, who I keep foreshadowing and playing the pronoun game with for some reason.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> makes the deck what it is, letting you send cards from your hand, deck, or field to bring out a big nasty Dragon that really tears up the scene. Keep in mind that you can only set if you should choose to activate it from your hand, which I really dunno if you'll be doing all that much. Just let that one special Link I also keep foreshadowing do the job and you'll be good to go.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Spirit"">Red-Eyes Spirit</a> acts as a second and third Monster Reborn for your Red-Eyes monsters, once again any of them. A revival that can be searched with a card that also sets up its respective archetype's grave effects. Now how about that?

<a data-name=""Return of the Red-Eyes"">Return of the Red-Eyes</a> is surprisingly good, where simply if you control a Red-Eyes monster, you can revive any Normal monster, period, from your grave, including the Geminis, which you'll most often be summoning with it. Say hello to Archfiend and Gearfried once more, and you can activate it during either turn! A great way to keep your resources coming back for more. Even if your opponent destroys it, though, its use doesn't end there, as upon destruction it basically becomes a Red-Eyes Spirit, letting you bring back another Red-Eyes monster. You'll only really need to run one, given all the other revival stuff in the deck. Still, it's the gift that keeps on giving.

&nbsp;
<h2>Extra Deck</h2>
Ah yes, finally. I get to bring up that one boss monster. Without further ado...

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> easily makes the deck what it is. Requiring relatively generic material to bring out, its nifty 2800 ATK becomes 3000 once any of your Red-Eyes monsters attack. Heck, as long as you've got warriors in your grave and Red-Eyes left to attack with, you can keep on equipping and powering up with Warriors to bring from the grave to keep the muscle going. But wait, its second effect is even better. If your opponent has the gall to try and target any card you control with their own card or effect, you can send a Warrior or Black Metal Dragon to counter and really show them who's boss. And even if Slash is destroyed, you get to Special summon whatever Warrior was attached to it upon destruction. All around, very good to have on your side.

<a data-name=""Meteor Black Comet Dragon"">Meteor Black Comet Dragon </a>is another fusion brought out by Red-Eyes Fusion, this one packing a mighty high ATK stat and an effect that Foolish Burial's a Red-Eyes and burns for its original ATK afterwards. Furthermore, if it's sent to the grave from the monster zone, you get to revive a Normal monster a la Return of the Red-Eyes just like that.

I don't suppose you'll be bringing out Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon all that much, but it's definitely got its use. Protected from destructive card effects while it has material, it also burns for 500 every time your opponent activates a card or effect. Also during either turn, you can detach a material to revive a Red-Eyes Normal monster. Man, what is it with this deck and revival of Normal monsters?
<p class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a> is another R7 Xyz that's out and about for the effect of bringing about two tokens for free you can either use for this card's destruction effect or for additional Link summons and such. Not really much else to say, just a good niche to fill.</p>
Another useful niche is filled by <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. This one essentially lets you gain control of one of your opponent's monsters without too much a drawback. Only real restriction on this card is that it requires two L7's to bring out, but you can't really complain since Alternative and other revivals for your L7's are things.

The one big Link monster in the deck is <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>. Not only can it make a monster DARK and set up different kinds of Super Poly plays, but by paying 2000 LP, you can send a Polymerization or Fusion card to the grave to copy it. Keep in mind that while sending Red-Eyes Fusion, you can still bring out its monster despite the fact you've already summoned the turn, but after that point you just can't summon again for the rest of the turn.

The other monsters in the deck are mostly your <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> targets, like First of the Dragons, Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, Predaplant Dragostapelia, Mudragon of the Swamp, etc. and etc. Good for getting rid of your opponent's powerful tools and coming back with your own, as the card is known for.

&nbsp;

All in all, I've grown to admire Red-Eyes and this particular build I've put together. Hopefully you find it just as fun to wave around as I did. If you've got any tips on how I can improve the deck, say, in the choice of Gemini monsters or Warrior material for Slash Dragon, do let me know in the comments below and I'll try and take it to heart as best I can. 'Till then, as far as who let you in on this particular thing, fuggedaboudit."

But you can still kick some butts quickly ;) but nowe you must have good hand. It could be easier to win  with Utopia Double OTK mechanic (instant fusion and double or nothing), but I wanted to keep something from original  charm of this archetype.

All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.

Please check my other decks. You will not regret. Something nice for everyone will be found.

My old idea adapted to current ban list and with application new cards. You haven't seen Gouki in this form.

CONTROL{no summon}very consistent,"Hi guys ! With the good ovation if my previous decks, im back with another cool deck
This deck is very easy to play!
The strategy is to not let your opponent
Summon monsters. Also in this deck
That i've build, you must save your 
Normal summon till u get one of
The combo pieces that i will explain
Later
First thing: you can replace <a data-name=""double summon"">double summon</a>
<a data-name=""Lightning storm"">Lightning storm</a>
Thou it depends on how you play it

strategy: we have 3 ace monsters here

3 copies of each that make them 9

The aces are:

<a data-name=""ARCHLORD KRISTYA"">ARCHLORD KRISTYA</a>

<a data-name=""VANITY'S FIEND"">VANITY'S FIEND</a>

<a data-name=""VANITY'S RULER"">VANITY'S RULER</a>

this ace monsters stop player(s) to special summon, and since they attack are mid-high

Its very hard to beat them without special summons.

You must use your danger! Cards to get atleast 2 monsters on the field(for tribute summon)and use them to draw constantly to finally get one of those ace monsters. And then normal summon the ace monster. As i mentioned earlier , save your normal summon til you get a ace monster.

Also if you didnt get any of them, there is a card that might help you ;

<a data-name=""Phantom skyblaster"">Phantom skyblaster</a> --&gt; normal summon this guy only when u got sure u wont get any ace monsters,and if you do this card makes some tokens, then link them away to <a data-name=""SARYUJA"">SARYUJA</a> ,and if you get lucky you will draw archlord kristya [ the good thing about kristya is that it can be special summoned, unlike the vanity guys, so it can be special summoned by saryuja]

Please like and comment on this post if you like it and let me know if you want more deck profile .

LOVE YOU GUYS-meta slayer

<span>This non-meta deck focuses on the past strategy of Clownblade, where you can spam XYZ Rank 4s. However, with the times' progressing signs, there are also options to fusion and link summon while going against Top Tier Meta. Personally, it got me either on or very near the top 100 leaderboards on a popular online simulator website for <span>Yu-Gi-Oh! </span><span>So I know this deck packs a powerful punch if you know what you are doing on certain moves. I'm a firm believer that rogue non-meta decks can not only compete on their own but also destroy meta decks to keep your opponent guessing.</span></span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>It would help if you preferred to go second because:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>1.) Most effect monsters in this deck have the effect of ""If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can special summon this card.""</span></p>
<p><span>2.) You can One-Turn-Kill with the ""Number 39: Utopia Double"" strategy. Minimum: You get a boosted 10,000 ATK or higher ""Number 39: Utopia"") by attacking into an opponent's attack mode monster, if and only if the opponent's monster has 2000 attack points or less (10000 ATK utopia minus 2000 ATK monster equals 8000 damage). It means you won when your opponent has 8000 life points or less. There are some support cards for Utopia in this deck to give other power boosts, protection, and other fun shenanigans. You can power up Utopia as well as getting different variants of him on the field.</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li><span>The Clownblade Performage Engine includes cards such as ""Performage Trick Clown,"" ""Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades,"" ""Performage Damage Juggler,"" and ""Performage Hat Tricker."" The Clownblade engine alone provides Level 4 monsters to spam, block any battle damage from opponent attacks, and block any burn effect damage. </span></li>
 	<li><span>You can even pendulum summon as well.</span></li>
 	<li><span>All other cards are tech and staples.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Side deck punishes spamming or certain game mechanics.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Some cards are in the deck for fun (Such as using the Melodious cards).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span> 1. ) For example, you can use the fusion spell card, ""Ostinato,"" to special summon ""Schuberta the Melodious Maestra."" By the effect of <span>""Ostinato,"" that monster </span><span>gets destroyed by the End Phase. Then you special summon ""Aria the Melodious Diva"" and ""Elegy the Melodious Diva"" from your Deck. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Above is a formidable defensive board lock where your Melodious monsters</span><em> cannot be targeted and cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects</em><span>. There are few options to beat this board lock move. Your opponent can s</span><em>en</em><em>d (without targeting)</em><span> those cards to the graveyard or banish zone, </span><em>not targeting</em><span> with card effects, such as ""Super Polymerization,"" <em>tributing with the Kaiju monsters archetype</em>, or </span><em>negating all card effects on the field</em><span>, such as ""Skill Drain."" </span></span></p>
<p><span>""Ostinato"" uses cards from deck or hand. You can send more fodder Melodious cards to the graveyard to make the entire deck more consistent to make other moves without using Melodious cards.</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li><span>Another fun thing is to run ""Neos Fusion"" to disrupt the field. Rainbow Neos works very well with the Utopia OTK.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Some other cards, such as field spells and other spells/traps, are situational. This deck composes of spellcasters, fairies, and warriors.</span></li>
 	<li><span>I run the Egyptian God cards for fun. Why not since I can spam out monsters fast? </span></li>
 	<li><span>You can link summon.</span></li>
 	<li><span>You can still run it for Master Rule 4 or Master Rule 5.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Remember, if you believe in the heart of the cards, and you need a deck that can fit almost all situations, you should try out the deck. It's fun and competitive!</span>"

<span>
The deck is highly consistent just like before and with added bonuses in form of ""Evenly Matched"", ""Infinite Impermanence"" and ""Psy Framegear Gamma"" which can have itself or Driver sent from deck to grave by Shaddoll Fusion, thus allowing Construct to reach the field.</span>

<span>
Gamma can help in a lot of ways as you may already know, by negating the negation of: ""Lonefire Blossom"", ""Shaddoll Fusion"" and ""Frightfur Patchwork"".</span>

<span>

The deck is highly consistent just like before and with added bonuses in form of ""Evenly Matched"", ""Infinite Impermanence"" and ""Psy Framegear Gamma"" which can have itself or Driver sent from deck to grave by Shaddoll Fusion, thus allowing Construct to reach the field.

Gamma can help in a lot of ways as you may already know, by negating the negation of: ""Lonefire Blossom"", ""Shaddoll Fusion"" and ""Frightfur Patchwork"".

Not sure if optimized but i,"Ok, the main goal is to summon Dark Strike Fighter and Coltwing + 3 tokens then change the levels of all the tokens to 13 and finally activate DSF ability on a level 43 Coltwing dealing 8600 damage in 1 turn.

To do this the deck has a bunch of tools, the easiest way to do it is by special summoning a mon ( hack worm, UDai-&gt;Cyber Falcon and others) and summoning O-Lion. With those 2 make Needlefiber, bring from the deck Warbluran and use O-Lion ability to SS a token. Then you can LinkS Auroradon from NFiber and the token, use SynchroS Dark Strike Fighter with Warbluran and 2 tokens and finally use Auroradon ability, tributing itself and a token to bring Coltwing from the Deck. You end up with 3 level 3 Tokens, Level 13 Coltwing and DSF.

There are other ways to pull it off but honestly I'm unable to precisely recall them all (or analyze the deck, I barely know what I'm doing), but with speedroid shenaningans it's surprisingly more consistent to reach the winning board state than what you may think. The biggest problem of the deck are the spells, ideally you get Galaxy Queen's Light on your hand,but  if you don't, there are some drawing spells to help and if you are lucky, you might even find a Star Light, Star Bright - Resonance Device combo. Those 2 spell cards are the only other way to change the levels of the tokens, if you can't get any of the Level changing spells, then you are dead, because the deck doesn't have a contingency plan.

This is my first deck and it's probably very poorly optimized I invite evryone to try and see if there are better ways to pull it off. I can see it evolving in 2 ways: Increase the consistency of the FTK, find a way to put good use to the tokens and tuners with the FTK as ""Backup""."

This version of the deck varies from the standard variation of the zombie strategy by not just being a control deck but also being good at combos.

The deck has a few decent starters, gozuki, Uni-zombie, sharinui solitaire, and Armageddon knight all help to get your grave yard dumping started.

A high ratio of Danger monsters are used for draw power, combos, and getting cards out of the hand that you want in the grave.

Destiny hero malicious is involved as he is easy to dump into the grave and can help be a nice combo extender.

Droll and lock is replacing ash as it is just better for the new format, with so many decks searching so many times the one search negate of ash blossom is not enough, so instead of stopping one search, let that one be the only search they get.

Now for the big bois, Doomking Balerdroc, and Jack-o-bolan (and a secret third option). These cards can effectively say no to may of your opponents plays by straight up negating the effect, banishing a combo piece, or stealing the combo piece before it can do it's thing. With these card on field it can be almost unfair to go against as many of the deck that can out zombies stop being able to since they can't reach their combos. For those making their own deck there is a third option to consider, Hela generaider boss of doom. She can tribute zombie monsters on your field to special summon a zombie with a different name from your graveyard, her plus Jack-o-bolan can steal your opponents monsters to then tribute them off banishing them in the process while also grabbing combo pieces from your grave or extra deck monsters that were already defeated. I personally do not run her as I had a hard time finding a place in this variant of the deck but she is an option.

Extra deck time

Omega just refreshes all of your combo pieces back to grave or brings back a doomking that probably got called by the graved. With Omega you can just continue using resources as much as you really want.

Vampire sucker is free draws basically and can helped get more cards in hand to get to your hand traps or super poly. She also has a nice effect to tribute your opponents cards to summon a zombie (you don't know how fun it is to tribute a super quantal mech king great magnus to summon a card to your field).

Number 60 really just helps you finish off the game that turn if you need to

Abyss dweller does abyss dweller things

Borrelsword and Red eyes otk

the rest are pretty self explanatory"

Very good for locals. (Tier 2-3),"Hi everybody! I've been testing this deck for a long time now and I thought it would be a good idea to share this build with other people. This is by far the deck list that has given me the best results. It's not a meta deck by any means, but it is definitely a good deck choice for your locals or even to steal a couple of wins at a regional.

&nbsp;

The Main Deck in my opinion is close to perfection. I'll give you the reasoning behind each card choice:

Monsters: 12

3 Commandant: Terraforming with legs. Playing 3 copies is mandatory.

2 Spiritualist: Awesome and needed to fusion summon. I play Duality and Demise, so I don't always want nor need to go for a fusion summon.

2 Spy: Perfect ratio. This card is ridiculously good. I'm suprised some people don't play it anymore. Huge defense, amazing synergy with Headman and it allows you to have extra presence on the board, which is always good in this deck.  I resolve it most of the time.

1 Descendant. Still a very solid card. Good synergy with Headman and Rite of Spirit.

1 Headman. Speak of the devil! Mandatory, at least at 1. I don't like it at 2. It is searchable and I never wanna see it turn 1.

3 Ash: Too good going first or second. Demise is at 1 now, so this handrap helps you more than it affects you.

I don't like Heretic. It is a good card, but I can't stand the fact that it doesn't have good synergy with supernaturalist nor with super polymerization (unless you have it in your hand). I guess you could add one to the deck, but to me it is pointless.

&nbsp;

Spells: 16

3 Necrovalley: Heart and soul of the deck. Needless to talk about it.

3 Throne: Rota or Double Summon for Gravekeepers. Again, nothing left to say here.

3 Royal Tribute: Amazing card! If you go 1st: Activate Necrovalley, activate this card, game 2. This will happen very frequently, unless your opponent plays a heavy backrow deck or you go second. I strongly recommend you playing this in the main deck and not the side deck. With 3 copies plus 7 draw spells, you will see Royal Trubute quite often. There are some instances in which you can still use it going second. Worth playing it in the Main Deck in my opinion.

3 Pot of Desires: Some people hate this card here. I totally love it! Having that plus 1 in hand can be so useful. Rarely I banish key cards when paying the cost. I guess you could just play two if you hate it that much, but it is definitely a good card.

3 Duality: I used to play 2. Now I have to play it at 3 since demise went to 1. It is an excelent card in your first hand. It allows you to quickly access to an additional card that you might be needing. Again, you don't always require to go for the fusion summon, even less XYZ plays. A set Gravekeeper plus a solid backrow and necrovalley is most of the time more than enough.

1 Card of Demise: Still awesome! Play it... please!

These are my 7 draw spells. Of course, if I had money I would play pot of extravagance. It is still way too expensive for me. If you can have access to it, consider making some changes to the ratios. I would go 2 desires. 2 extravagance, 2 duality and 1 demise maybe. It is important to mention that for this deck, 7-8 drawing spells is a reasonable ratio. Remember, it is essential to get Necrovalley in your first hand, and even thought you play ""9 copies"" of the card (commandant and throne), sometimes it can be difficult to get it if you don't have the right drawing spell.

Observation: In case you were wondering about Hidden Temples, it is a great card and it can completely shut down most decks. The problem is the requirements. If you lose Necrovalley or your Gravekeeper, you lose this card. It is searchable by Supernaturalist, but I wouldn't play it at more than 1. Feel free to experiment with it a little bit if you want, but in my case, when I tested it it was quite often a dead card in my hand.

Trap cards: 12

1 Imperial Tombs: Amazing card. I used to play it at 2, but I realized 1 was better. I did it because of the requirements, similar to Hidden Temples. If you lose either Necrovalley or your Gravekeepers, or if you are unable to get either of the 2 in your first hand, this card is totally dead. However, it doesn't leave the field if you set it. Having 1 copy is worth it.

1 Necrovalley Temple: I used to underestimate this card. Really good! It protects your Necrovalley and it surprises your opponent reducing their attack points. Searchable. 1 is totally fine.

1 Rite of spirit: Your monster reborn. Good interaction with Headman.

3 Solemn Strike: Counter trap. Speed 3. Really good!

3 Solemn Judgement: Mandatory! With Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched in the format, you need this!

3 Crackdown: This card is extremely powerful. I don't regret adding this card to the deck. Stealing your opponent's monsters can completely prevent them from going for their combos and at the same time stoping them from attacking you directly. Love the card!

&nbsp;

The Extra Deck, as you can see, includes Super Poly targets mostly. These are in my opinion the best ones. You can always make some changes depending on then players at your locals. (I wish the Trishula Fusion wasn't just a Jump promo). I play a couple of XYZ monsters. Again, this is up to you. Those are the ones I like the most. The reason why I play the Beat cop from the underworld is because I needed a generic link two for my Crackdown targets. You could play the other generic links such us the Knightmares, but I decided not to play them because of the discard cost. All my Gravekeepers are level 4, except Headman (which is meant for fusion summon and in some instances for a Descendant target), so my XYZs are easy to summon.

&nbsp;

The Side Deck, again depends of your local scene. Evenly matched is busted, Twin twister is mandatory in my opinion and Dark bribe for me is amazing in order to stop my opponent's Evenly matched or Lightning Storm. The rest of the cards depend on you. It is worth mentioning that I moved Super Poly to my Side Deck because many guys at my locals are no longer playing dark mosnters or have decided to move to backrow decks. If you still feel like it, you can have it in your main deck and perhaps take out your Ash Blossoms. I don't know. It's up to you.

&nbsp;

The reason why I decided to share this deck with you is because 1) I absolutely love the deck. 2) I have tested it several times with very good results. Of course, feel free to either disagree with some of my choices or maybe recommend other options. I hope this can help some of you Gravekeeper lovers. Enjoy the deck! ;)"

Here's a recipe of mine for a fun and strong deck.

I like Fluffals as they are powerful enough to wipe out enemy LP in one turn, but they usually can't compete in a long duel, nor they can counter.

Adding Heroes will strengthen their forces without changing play style, enhancing the Polymerization search and graveyard playing.

Use basic Toy Vendor combo, recycle Polymerization spells with field spell, fill the graveyard with Monster Gate and Destiny Hero Malicious!

Beware: you will run out of cards quickly!

This deck will fully utilize it's potential with Speedroids to asse,"<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/L0ZiIYA.jpg"" alt=""image"" />

Unpopular strategy of Invoked made viable with Speedroid. A combo deck that can stun with Barrier Statue of Stormwinds while having Invoked toolboxes and recurrence with possible synchro plays for breaking board thanks to Speedroid. <strong>The combo is Aleister + tuner/Parallel Exceed/Terrortop</strong>. The Terrortop route basically summoning itself + Taketomborg and normal summon Aleister and make Simorgh via Harpie link, then Invocation for Raidjin. Parallel Exceed route is just summoning Almiraj and u get free 2 copies Parallel Exceeds which are wind for Harpie link.

The tuner route takes longer and creates more advantage. It is similar to OCG Needlefiber (Halqifibrax in TCG) turbo for Releaser Dragun. Make Needlefiber using Aleister + tuner, ss O-Lion, link off Needlefiber for Linkross, use Linkross summon 2 tokens, tune O-Lion + 1 token for Martial Metal Marcher, use Martial chain O-lion, ss O-Lion ss Mecha Phantom Beast Token, tune Martial + another lv1 token for Speedroid Puzzle (for another Speedroid recovery), link off Puzzle + Mecha Phantom Beast Token for Harpie Conductor, link off Conductor + Linkross for Simorgh, use Invocation, ss Raidjin using GY material (use wind monster that cant be recycled). Any Speedroid extender can help to synchro while establishing the same board.

Also pay attention to cards' restriction on their effect like on the Speedroids and Wynn wind searcher.

Cards to think of: <a data-name=""Old Entity Hastorr"">Old Entity Hastorr</a> (replace Puzzle, can steal monster combined with @Ignister Wind Pegasus), another Invoked fusion monsters (extra deck is tight, you can replace some), Crystal Wing (kinda not easy to make cus only via Charge Warrior + O-Lion), Fast Dragon (the negation only for extra deck monster, can be put in depends on you), Droll &amp; Lock Bird (great wind handtrap but not a tuner)."

During your first turn you should be able to summon True King of All Calamities and Toadally Awesome, which is pretty good against all decks of the format. Mermail Abyssalacia is also a great card, because by discarding 1 water monster, which can be infantry, so you'll destroy a card your opponent controls, makes you have a big mermail monster in your hand for continue playing the next turn. So, the turn 1 combo is Abyssalacia equipped with Mizuchi (searched by Megalo); True King of All Calamities or Bahamut Shark + Toadally Awesome. I play 3 called by the grave just because this deck is weak to ash on Deep Sea Diva. Another useful combo is making Avramax using Masquerena, because I:P makes Avramax indestructible, and you'll have a 3000 ATK monster on the field that can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's card effects, and that gains ATK when it's attacked or it's attacking.

The deck revolves around both the Timelord's stalling potential and Herald's absurd negations.

You should start first and setup your Herald of Perfection/Ultimateness on the board(Ultimateness is more powerfull but leaves you hand emptier so you can't use the effect as much. Be wise)

If you can't, then stall with Time Maiden and Timelords until you have a better play.

There is a specific play that you may be able to use sometimes. You need Time Maiden, 1 Timelord and the Celestial spell(to special summon 1 timelord). You use Time Majden to add Michion to your hand and summon him and the other timelord (mainly Metaion) and attack with both. Using Michions effect to take 4000 LP from your opponent and during main phase 2 you can summon Superdreadnaught Gustav Max and deal an extra 2000 damage for a huge 6000+damage turn.

I think i can't explain this deck with words so you should just try it for yourself

It has a high potential. If you guys are tired with meta deck or some deck you like are too expensive like ,"Before, I played counter fairy, it did worked well. However, gradually, a lot of competitive decks come up, and their recovery are crazy. And because of the new ban list, I have to find another ways.

I found that generaider is a great deck, this deck needs only the field to have the monster. However there are some cards in OCG that haven't come out yet.  Therefore, Generaider has no negation on opponents.

Consequently, I mix the counter fairy with generaider. This deck is 100% fun and crazy af.

Pros: -going first is the best, You don't care nibiru or any hand trap, we have alot counter trap and interupted card.

-We can search counter trap through the parsath monster and this deck is level 9 which means you can make true king of all calamities.

- We have negation, destroy card, banish card,  easy to summon big monster from deck or hand or graveyard, power of search or draw card.

-Your opponent rarely can get through.

Cons: -Going second is not great at all. You dont wanna see any big monster in you hand, especially the parshath monster and dovelgus.

-If your opponent has card that can destroy spell trap like twin twister or cosmic or sleeper( spyral), or salamagreat(trap). we almost lost that game.

-This deck dont have much handtrap and cannot OTK.

-If your opponent kaiju, we fuked up.

-It does brick sometimes.

&nbsp;

Solution: I have side a lot of type card to get through this.

Nibiru, lava golem, evenly match.

Especially, I side unending nightmare to fight against some hard match-up like subterror, altergeist, and other decks that use field spell, or continuous spell/trap

Waking the dragon is essential to fight back some decks that have cards destroy spell trap like twins twister, cosmic and even lightning storm.

Finally, Hope you enjoy this deck while playing. Thank you for take a look.

<span>This deck supplements the full suite of Super Quant monsters with Danger! monsters to extend plays, trigger graveyard effects, and help to make Xyz ranks 3, 4, and 7.</span>

<span>The deck uses levels 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7, with most cards having GY effects and the in-archetype spells being recurrable/recyclable by the effects of Red/Blue respectively, so Reasoning has the potential to make a big impact. The Quant field spell also requires a discard cost to make an easy Xyz monster from a Quant you have on the field, allowing you to trigger Dangers or Trick Clown for bonus value (and the discard cost pays for itself if you have the Quant Link on the field offering a draw 1 for every new Quant Xyz summon). And Phantazmay, on top of being a potent hand trap against any deck relying on Links, can also set up for your Rank 7 Xyz, and activate discard/GY effects.</span>

<span>If you really want to flex on your opponent, you can potentially summon Dugares and Gossip Shadow together, use Gossip Shadow's effect to attach itself and its material to Dugares, use the GY effect of Overlay Booster to boost Dugares with an extra 2500 ATK, then use Dugares' effect to double its own ATK to a hefty 7400. This combo isn't remotely practical, but that's not really the point, is it?</span>
<p><span><b>Getting Familiar with the Super Quant Archetype</b></span></p>
&lt;!--more--&gt;

<span>If you've stumbled across this and are curious but have no experience with the Super Quant series of cards, here's a quick crash course:</span>

<span>The archetype mainly consists of a set of main deck monsters that have a corresponding extra deck monster: the pilots and the mechs (or Rangers and Zords if you prefer). <strong>Blue = 3, Green = 4, Red = 5, White = 7</strong>. Each pilot (the ""Layer"" monsters) have an effect when they hit the field, and another when they hit the graveyard; an easy trick for keeping this effects straight in your head is to remember <strong>Blue = deck, Green = hand, Red = Graveyard</strong>, with White being something of a wildcard.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><span><strong>Blue</strong></span><strong> - </strong><strong> </strong>Field: add Quant from deck to hand | GY: shuffle Quant(s) from GY to deck</span></li>
 	<li><span><strong><span><span>Green</span> -</span></strong><span> Field: summon  Quant from hand | GY: discard Quant to draw</span> </span></li>
 	<li><span><span><strong><span>Red</span></strong></span><strong><span> - </span></strong><span>Field: add Quant from GY to hand | GY: summon Quant from GY</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span>White Layer is a wildcard that can send any Quant monster from your deck to the GY to copy its level and attribute, and when White Layer is sent to the GY, you can add an Alphan to your hand. Alphan is something of a wildcard of its own (it can make all of your monsters, including itself, match the level of one of your Quant monsters for easy Xyz plays), and is often the single most impactful card in the deck with its tribute effect that takes 3 Quant monsters from your deck, summons 1, and puts the other 2 in the GY (letting you activate all corresponding effects in the process).</span>

<span>The Xyz monsters (with ranks that match the levels of the pilots with the corresponding attribute/color) also all act similar to one another. They all require material to attack, they can all add Quant monsters to themselves as material, and their detach abilities become quick effects when they have their corresponding pilot attached as material. Blue destroys back row, Green flips face down (Book of Moon), Red destroys monsters, and White negates monster effects.</span>
<p><span><strong>Getting the most out of your Alphan</strong></span></p>
<span>Alphan is probably the single most impactful card in this entire deck, so understanding how to effectively use Alphan is key. Since the addition of Super Quantum White Layer, you now have an additional means for searching out Alphan, and a choice to make when activating Alphan's tribute effect (as know you get to choose which 3 of the 4 monsters to reveal from your deck, whereas before your 3 choices were the only 3 choices).</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><em>Always</em> choose Red. 1/3: Red gets summoned and you get to Alphan, 1 of the other 2 that just went to the GY, or any other Quants that were in there before to your hand; 2/3 Red goes to the GY meaning you'll get to summon 2 monsters off of Alphan's effect instead of just the 1.</span></li>
 	<li><span>You almost always want to choose White as well. Alphan makes this deck fly, and if White lands in the GY, you get an Alphan in your hand (something you definitely want). If White gets summoned, his effect lets you send <em>another</em> Quant monster from deck to GY, meaning you get to choose 1 of the 2 GY effects that didn't activate as a result of Alphan to go ahead and activate anyway</span></li>
 	<li><span>Whether or not you choose Green generally comes down to what's in your hand.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>If you've got another Quant monster in hand, choosing Green will 1/3: let you summon whatever's in your hand, or 2/3: let you discard that monster to draw a card (and activate its GY effect if you haven't already).</span></li>
 	<li><span>If you've got Quant spells/traps you don't particularly need in your hand, choosing Green will 2/3: let you discard one to draw a new card, but if you don't also have a Quant monster in hand, you run the 1/3 risk of having no target to summon.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><span>If your deck only has 1 copy of any of the Quant monsters left in it, choosing Blue is a good idea. 2/3: Blue will go to the GY allowing you to recycle Quant monsters, allowing you to make sure your deck always has enough to keep Alphan's effect live; 1/3: Blue will let you search for a field spell when summoned, or a White Layer to special summon by sending Blue to the GY (activating the recycle effect you wanted in the first place). Even if there are no White layer's left to search, you can often just make an Xyz and detach blue, or use Blue as link material to trigger the recycle. <em>It's important to always keep a full set of Quants in your deck to keep Alphan live</em>.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Even though Alphan is amazing, you generally shouldn't search for Alphan when summoning Blue. If Alphan is what you want (unless you also want to make a rank 3), its generally better to search for White who can then be special summoned (either by using the Blue you just summoned, or a Quant from your hand); White can then send another copy of White to the GY and <em>then</em> you can search for Alphan off of White's GY effect. On the topic of White's GY effect, you can add an Alphan to hand from deck <em>or GY</em>, and just as its good to always keep 1 of each Quant in your deck to keep Alphan's effect live, its good to leave 1 Alphan in your deck to keep One for One live.</span>"

I prepared for this YTC by playing against Grimm, playing against him a lot. This didn't help me learn the meta, it helped me more as to just learn basic Trinity. In this list I played too much s/t hate cause I was not considering sera summoning myrm, I also didn't play set rotation as I believed I had enough copies of generaid stage, I am still thorn if that was the right call

This deck was so suprisingly good that my only loss was in swiss against Dark Magician just because I had no idea how to fight that deck, later I rematched that deck in finals and with the experience from my swiss match won."

OCG only for this one folks. Sorry. We've got special summoning from the hand. We've got special summoning from the deck. 1 Card XYZ Monsters galore - easy Rank 4s and 5s. Some matchups you want to go first, set up some negates or good disruption. Toadal Abyss was the working name of the deck, we're using Bahamut to cheat out TA, then locking people out of their graveyard with Dweller. We've also got Evenly Matched, for those matchups where you can tear down boards AND set up high quality negates. Some hands like going second, some first. Don't fret over a coin toss, just get the job done with whatever tool you need to do it. 1 spicy Raigeki because it actually seems plausibly good in a deck like this. Impermanence because it can put you over the top, and is good going first and second.

Cutter Shark is the engine the entire deck revolves around. It gives you a free special summon of any of your fishy friends, right out of the deck. 1 card XYZ monster. Its buddy, Lantern Shark, lets you make another special summon from the hand (in a deck that was already running Goldfish) and it also counts as a level 5 monsters for making XYZ summons. These do lock you out of other types of summons on the turn you use them, which is relevant. Then there's the Tuna! Tuna is a level 1 fish support - when its summoned it turns into any of your other fishies! So that's broken. Double Fin Shark is also a powerful card in its own right - he pulls a fish out of the bin when you normal him. On its own, its another 1 card XYZ summon, but it can easily extend further than that. Its effect also turns on White Stingrays tuner ability, meaning its easy to search for the synchro material to make White Aura Whale, a reasonable threat that wipes boards and can help close out games. Did I mention we're wiping the board? Because we're wiping the board. Stingray doubles as a cheap special summon, and a way to fill the bin to get value out of normaling Double Fin. Then there's Silent Angler, which is just Bubbleman on Steroids. Real MVP there, always useful. Plus Royal Fish so tuna can be a tuner!

For traps, it's just the good stuff. ;) There's the obligatory Upstart, a Monster Reborn, which again can easily turn into multiple special summons, as well as Instant Fusion for Restrict Shenanigans and easy level 4s, One for One to find Tuna, and 2 Sea Lord's Amulet, which protects all of our water monster from destruction by card effects for 3 turns. These are amazing, but terrible in numbers generally, so 2 seems about right, 1 might be reasonable. Then there's 3 Pot of Desires. I haven't figured out exactly WHY Pot of Desires is better in some builds than others. Obviously it goes poorly for decks searching for one ofs. But in a deck like this I felt I needed the greed, and none of our singles overlap, and thankfully I think it works.

In the toolbox, I have the aforementioned Bahamut Shark and Abyss Dweller. There's also Silent Honor Ark, more useful here than Castel thanks to the water theme (for example, attack bonuses, protection, ability to link away). Good removal is good. I thought Diagusto Emeral was banned when I first built this deck but he's not. It gives the deck some much needed longevity, and it can actually help in 2 pot games to keep from decking out. Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark is here because it has a cool name. Oh, also it's a backup way to resurrect restrict monsters from the extra deck. And a beater. Oh and it's battle protection too. In a deck like this, where it can easily be gaining 1000 attack and reducing the opponent's attack by 1000... it falls short of commonly used toolbox beaters, but it gets all the fringe benefits of being a water monster. Then we have a couple level 5s, to take advantage of that powerful shark core. Valiant Shark Lancer is extremely good removal - two spell speed 2 pops on any monster, and an effect that gains you value if your other water XYZ monsters get destroyed while it's on the field. Plus, it's another reasonable beater. It does require you to run it beside other water XYZ monsters, but that shouldn't be a problem. A removal magnet that removes 2 things? Not bad. Then we have Artifact Durendal. It lets us set up more ""negates"", and while it can interfere with the Amulets, it can also help fix our hand to maybe get some free special summons and solve some of those problem games.

Sideboard is crap.

Made some changes. Trying Left-Arm/Right Arm fish with more graveyard enablers."

I played Zombies because I told Burrito I would play them if I could not top the previous cup and I couldn't. They were really popular when I first started playing Trinity but lost it's power since. I haven't played them back then because I was trying to be a hipster but I have played against it and also watched some replays so it was fine.

What tech choices did you play? Absorouter and Rokket Synchron. Many people were playing it I think (?). It really feels bad to play but also really rewarding when you can actually use it. I have considered siding them out often but usually did not. There is also Danger Bigfoot which is the best discard fodder :3. Nothing unusual really, the list is very similar to Burrito's and he knows what he is doing.

How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?

All the good S/T Hate and it still is not enough right? Pendulum is also a deck. Zombies are actually pretty refined at this point being an old deck. All the combos, all the gimmicks. What changed is the players in tournaments mostly and they were not ready to out Vampire Fraulein I guess. I don't think I will play this deck again anytime soon so I don't really know how it's going to adapt the meta but it certainly will."

I played DM cause drawing 4 is fun. Also Mahad is a cute boi. The DM deck pretty builds itself. The only real choice in building it is whether you play fusion turbo or control. I preferred control so, I played control. I did not prepare for the meta. I just wanted to see how many cards I could draw in a game and sometimes at the end of drawing, I would win games. Most of my match ups deck-wise were bad but, people not knowing how my deck functioned let me win games I had no business of winning."

Still not perfect, this deck is aimed at those who have already a deep understanding of Synchro decks, DO NOT simply copy it and pretend to know what you're doing, you're going to miss a lot of timings (hence I do not advise this list for newcomers, but feel free to try it of course). Generally speaking, this deck can evolve during the game into several bosses, each of them having specific traits accordingly to what you're facing.

For this reason we play x3 copies of <strong>Relinquished</strong> and x3 copies of  <strong>Black Illusion Ritual</strong> to ritual summon it. <strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong> can search one of these two when summoned and can be immediately tributed after we use its effect to summon <strong>Relinquished</strong>. <strong>Sangan</strong> can also search for one copy of <strong>Relinquished</strong> from the deck when sent to the Graveyard.

We main x2 of  <strong>Tsukuyomi</strong> to flip face-down our <strong>Relinquished</strong> so that the monster stolen in the previous turn is sent to the graveyard and we are able to steal another one. It can also be helpful to remove problematic cards (Jinzo, Monarchs, Blade Knight, Thousand-Eyes Restrict etc.) or to flip face-down one of our flip-effect monsters,  <strong>Morphing Jar</strong> or  <strong>Magician of Faith, </strong>or our own <strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict</strong>, which can be summoned using <strong>Metamoprhosis</strong> on <strong>Relinquished</strong>, <strong>Magician of Faith</strong>, <strong>Sinister Serpent </strong>or one of the <strong>Scapegoat</strong> token. <strong>Book of Moon</strong> serves the same purposes as <strong>Tsukuyomi</strong> but can also be used during the opponent's turn when needed.

Other support cards included in the deck are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Lava Golem</strong>: can be used to remove two monsters from the opponent field and then we can steal it with <strong>Relinquished</strong>, boosting its attack to 3000</li>
 	<li><strong>Swords of Revealing Light</strong>: can help to stall for a few turns</li>
 	<li><strong>Giant Trunade</strong>: can be used to clear the fields from dangerous trap cards, can bring back to the opponent's hand a monster stolen by <strong>Relinquished</strong> (or our <strong>Swords of Revealing Light</strong> when you draw them together)</li>
 	<li><strong>Threatening Roar</strong>: prevents OTK and does not remove monsters on the field, helpful when we are ready to summon <strong>Relinquished</strong> in the next turn, even more helpful if we have <strong>Lava Golem</strong> in hand</li>
 	<li><strong>Spell Shield Type-8</strong>: free negate for when the opponent uses <strong>Book of Moon</strong>, <strong>Nobleman of Crossout</strong>, <strong>Snatch Steal</strong> or <strong>Metamorphosis</strong>. Especially helpful when we have <strong>Relinquished</strong> or <strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict </strong>on the field since people like to use <strong>Book of Moon</strong> on them</li>
</ul>
The rest of the cards in the deck are staples of the format with a <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</strong> since we play a decent number of <span>LIGHT and DARK m</span>onsters.

The most basic combo is with:
