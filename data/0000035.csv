Then you return those monsters to your deck using Exodius and from there you go into your Rank 10.  If you have Ancient City - Rainbow Ruins you can bring out Malific Cyber End Dragon as an alternative Lvl 10.  Sphere mode for a nice non-targeting removal and another level 10 (albeit on delay).  Other then that it's Crystal turbo. Let's make that a thing!  I'm not the best at making decks to any suggestions to improve this idea would be greatly appreciated!

With abusing Black Metal Dragon and World Chalice Guardragon, the deck can make very powerful first turn boards. This iteration of the deck is the one i want tu run on my Region's WCQ.  Besides the main cards there are some cards that can be replaced by more powerful cards, i jusd did not do that, because i do not own those cards irl.  for exampe: Breakthrough Skill can be replaced with Infinite Impermanence.  I'm running 45 cards, because it's easier to test, and with all these things in the main deck, it sadly bricks using less then 43 cards.  Most Bricking Cards are (which can be runned with one less copy in the deck): Dragon Shrine, World Legacy Guardragon, Allure of Darkness, Red-Eyes Spirit.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This is an experiment deck.,Based off getting strong monsters out consistently and punishing players once the Red Dragon Archfiend gets out. This is an experiment deck. One big weakness with it is that it lacks draw power but makes up for it with a lot of searching.

I use Magic Reflector to protect Scout. However, decks with high speed and have monster with destroy-Spell-card effects are serious threats.  Qliphort decks nowadays are not fast enough so they need defensive cards as well as disruption cards like Vanity's Emptiness to work. But in my opinion, a Qliphort deck is easy to use (not many complicated combos), quite strong and annoying to your opponent. While Link summon is claiming its throne, Qliphort deck needs more support cards to survive.  P.S: This is my old deck so there would be no Qliphort Genius or Qlife's End. You could put them into your deck :)))  &nbsp;"

A Deck dedicated to ""Iron Chain"" monsters can be relatively flexible because of this.

Both can be used at once, and can be further devastating when combined with ""<a title=""Cemetary Bomb"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Cemetary_Bomb"">Cemetary Bomb</a>"". The user can also go for a beatdown strategy by taking advantage of how ""<a title=""Iron Chain Coil"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Chain_Coil"">Iron Chain Coil</a>"" can increase the ATK and DEF of an ""Iron Chain"" card permanently, as well as how ""<a title=""Iron Chain Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Chain_Dragon"">Iron Chain Dragon</a>"" can temporarily increase its own ATK.  Most ""Iron Chain"" monsters are not very strong on their own. Without a card that can protect them during battle (e.g. ""<a title=""Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Scrap-Iron_Scarecrow"">Scrap-Iron Scarecrow</a>"") or increase their ATK (e.g. ""<a title=""Gaia Power"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gaia_Power"">Gaia Power</a>""), most cannot survive long - at least, not until ""Iron Chain Coil"" increases their ATK after a few turns. Since the archetype is not fully dedicated to a single method of defeating the opponent, it may not be as easy to control as other Archetypes, unless the user has a very good idea of what these cards are capable of as a group and what external support works well with their intended strategy."

This deck is fairly simple, but it allows you to completely lock-down the opponent thats to the well known and awful (for your opponent) Zombie World + Rivarly of Warlords combo.  The final goal of the deck is to have a field made up by: Balerdroch, ZW, Rivarly (ASAP) and, if possible, Fraulein in the field. If you manage to do this (and, trust me, it is not even remotely hard to do), the game is basically over. The only ""difficult"" part of the combo is to draw Rivarly, but thankfully Vampire Sucker helps that too.  Thanks to the lock-down and Balerdroch in the field, the opponent has basically no way to safely do his combos. A little tip: Balerdroch effect can be activated if, when he comes back, Sucker is in the field, allowing you to instantly pop one of your opponent cards. Pretty neat, isn't it?  Without further ado, here is the deck."

I figured you all would enjoy his deck profile so I decided to post it now! This deck profile is dedicated to those of you who love playing Pendulum Magicians and want a really really good build. I also want to say that I'm really proud of him for getting second place the Jacksonville Regional this past weekend. Jeremy has been Pendulum Magicians ever since they first got released in 2014 and plays them better than anyone I know. If you want to learn more about Jeremy's past go check out my post on his NAWCQ Top 64 Pendulum Magician Deck Profile which I will leave a link below for. I will also leave the link to his deck profile from his win this weekend recorded by Pro-Play Games. Go like the video and support his win and PPG if you enjoy this deck! This deck always wants to go first, the goal of the deck is to make <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> before your pendulum summon by using extenders like <a data-name=""Chronograph Sorcerer"">Chronograph Sorcerer</a>, <a data-name=""Mythical Beast Master Cerberus"">Mythical Beast Master Cerberus</a> and or <a data-name=""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"">Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm</a>. This deck has a low brick rate although it can happen rarely. For those of you who love Pendulum Magicians and know how to play them, with this deck you will be able to end with 2 or 3, most of the time 3 and sometimes even 4 negates on the first turn. This deck does take practice to learn for those of you who are new to Pendulum Magicians and want to try them out, or who have little experience with the deck. I advise you keep practicing and you will get better with the deck over time and then you can crush your opponents!
