I wanted Dark magician for the nostalgia but i wanted something that would be a little different than the average take. Slamming a Dark Magician, Eternal Soul + Dark Magical Circle engine on top of a Witchcrafter deck seemed like a lot of fun, and i was right.  The main problem i suffered from while playing Dark Magician decks seemed to be monster effects, well-Â  Madame Verre takes care of that all on her own, and if you get grass off, her and Haine have ammo for days. You want to be building your dark magician banish engine asap but its ok to focus on cycling your Witchcrafters, they are basically the base of your strategy providing defense and cover for all of your other cards while you dig.  Navigate is a really fun hit tro bring out DM and WH, straight into your XYZ shenanigans, Chocolate for draw/ defense on top of other cycling and draw effects, its really usually just a matter of hitting grass or starting to hit draw cards to hit off combos.  Selene. is definitely a star of the show but i think the added in synchro paired with the Knightmares give a lot of flexibility; the side deck is just complimentary genarics that i think fit multiple satiations.

This deck build doesn't focus on the OTK of Prime Photon dragon. (Deck was made through TCG Banlist I just transfered it to YGO MD so adjustments can be made that suits OCG banlist more which YGO MD uses.)  The deck focuses on summoning Starliege Photon Blast Dragon, Solflare Dragon, and Number 90: Photon lord for turn 1 and you can even add a Number 38: Hope Harbinger summon if you got a very good hand. (Always leave a photon dragon to your hand if possible for Solflare Dragon's Effect or take Photon Dragon through Number 90's effect on your opponent's turn if you already have Photon Dragon you can take Galaxy Trance for backup.)  For turn 2 you can do the first turn combo but summon Prime Photon Dragon instead of Photon lord. OTK is not always possible in the deck because I only took 2 copies of Photon dragon because I think its one of the major issues why dead draws is being frequent. Though I suggest always do combo's that fits the situation and not recklessly always go for Prime Photon Dragon.  &nbsp;  I always summon Starliege Photon Blast Dragon if possible cause of its meat shield effect that protects my important monsters on the field and if you have an extra Photon Orbital you can even equip it to Starliege Photon Blast Dragon for full protection of your monsters on the field.  I removed rank 5 Xyz summons and took only 2 copies of galaxy soldier because I think it barely goes in to play and most of the time I have one galaxy soldier hanging around on the field I use it for Forbidden Droplet tribute or for Solflare Dragon summon for its toolbox effect. I replaced rank 5 Xyz summons with Twin Photon Dragon because of its special summons and it can even save your normal summon to do more combo's.  &nbsp;  And for the extra deck as the usual either play AA-Zeus or Black Luster Soldier Â· Soldier Of Chaos for late game and the rest is just part of combo's or for the late game.  For the side deck you can replace Galaxy Expedition with a 3rd copy of Trade-In or a 2nd copy of Astral Kuriboh and if you have no Forbidden Droplet you can use Hyper Galaxy instead.  &nbsp;  (I got Platinum 3 (S3) with this deck within 1 week got 6-8 win streaks with the deck sadly I can't play more per day because of school stuff and job.)"

Fluffals, they're a Fusion deck, that does not xeno lock you into anything, which is the best kind of Fusion deck, but also means that it can Link climb (to an extent), and make Xyz plays because they're all of the same Level for the most part.</span> <span>Fluffals, a deck that most people say ""will OTK the shit out of you if you do not know where to hit it"" which after various testings, I do agree.</span> <span>Fluffals, a deck that gave me a reason to play the disgusting <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> engine.</span>  <span>That's Fluffals. Also you'll be seeing a lot of ""Toy Vendor"" but anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ The Fluffals (<a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Dog</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Penguin</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Dolphin</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Bear</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Owl</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Octopus</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Cat</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Wings</a>)</strong> - <span>Fluffals, your main deck monsters that you need to uh, you know... play a Fluffal deck. Here's their effects, if you do not know.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Dog - <span>Your main searcher for your Edge Imp Sabres in particular, for some reason, and any Fluffal monster, except itself. It just sucks that it can sometimes miss timing because it's a ""When..: You can"" but so is <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Stratos</a> but, you know... whatever. Clearly a 3 of, as per every main searcher, for understandable reasons.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Penguin - <span>Your main Normal Summon, I think, because having both Penguin and Dog on the field is better than having just Dog. It also lets you draw 2 cards then discard a card upon getting used as a Fusion Material. Both effects are hard once per turns, and also a 3 of.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Dolphin - <span>It recycles your <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and sends an Edge Imp Sabres or any Fluffal monster from your Deck to the GY, which is crazy good. It also recycles any 1 of your Fusion or Polymerization Spells in your GY or is banished if it is sent to the GY as Fusion Material, which is again, crazy good. Two is fine, I think. You could play 3 if you want.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Bear - <span>Your ""searcher"" for <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>, which is the heart and soul (and sometimes the bane) of this deck for reasons I'll discuss later. It also has an effect to Tribute itself to add back a Polymerization from your GY to your hand, although it targets. You can only use one or the other of its effects for some reason, which is I think the worst kind of restriction in game but I digress.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Owl - <span>I used to play 2 or more copies of this because it searches a Polymerization from the Deck and is a walking Polymerization itself at a cost of just paying 500 LP... until I realized that it has the ""one effect or the other"" type of restriction, so I cut it down to just 1 because it's searchable anyway.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Octopus - <span>This is the funniest card I have read for a Fusion archetype. Upon its Normal or Special Summon, it lets you add back any Fluffal or Edge Imp monster from your GY to your hand, which is neat and pretty normal, but if it is sent to the GY as a Fusion Material, it lets you <strong>return back to the GY up to 2 of your banished monsters</strong>. Usually, this only means that you get to recycle <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> + another Fluffal banished for its cost, or better yet, it can bring back a banished <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>. We don't have to worry about this interaction yet but in the TCG/OCG, its effect can be used to return back to the GY, a banished <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Dasher</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Celestial</a> that you used as Fusion Materials for <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, that you used to draw 2 cards for later use.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Cat - <span>The only reason I gave Cat a slot is because I think 1 Wings is manageable enough and also because recycling a Polymerization instantly after using it is just good to have. Feel free to cut it if you don't like it, but I personally do.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Wings - <span>The weirdest card in this list, at least I think so, because it does not immediately do anything since it needs a specific set up first of being in the GY alongside another Fluffal monster, having a live Toy Vendor to fully utilize its effects. It's a hard once per turn, and it's a draw 2 IF it completely resolves, but that's a massive IF.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>â¢ The Edge Imps (<a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Chain</a>, <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Sabres</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Scythe</a>)</strong> - <span>Edge Imps, the other half of your monsters that you need to play this deck. There's really nothing much else to talk about Chain because it's the most well known due to it being used as a search engine for generic Fusion decks. Scythe is one of the newest addition to the archetype, it's a hand trap that lets you Fusion Summon during your opponent's Main Phase, including itself. It also has a replacement effect, in case a ""Frightfur"" Fusion Monster(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect by banishing itself instead, which is always great to have.</span></span>  <span>And x3 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>, because it's a free hand trap, I guess. It could literally be any hand trap you want.</span>  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a></strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> for Fluffals. Combined with <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>, you could completely wipe out your opponent's entire board or it can turn your <a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a> into an absolute war machine if you decided to play it. Searchable one of, don't need more of it I think, at least in this version, idk you decide.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>A Fusion Deck needs a Fusion Spell, understandable. We only play two of because it's searchable and you don't want to open too many of it.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a></strong> - <span>Your main searcher Spell. Hard once per turn but is a mandatory three of, since it searches and Edge Imp monster and a Polymerization.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a></strong> - <span>Triggers your <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> search effect. Also a mandatory three of despite also being a hard once per turn because you could always pitch it for <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>A must have one of for any deck that likes having monsters in the GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> - <span>Reborns a monster, understandable.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a></strong> - <span>It's nice because it helps you recycle your Frightfur Fusion Monsters from the GY and Special Summon 2 monsters from your GY, one being a Fluffal and the other being an Edge Imp monster. It also allows you to summon 1 Fluffal and Edge Imp monster from your hand by banishing itself from your GY. The only acceptable card in this archetype to have the ""only one or the other"" restriction effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a></strong> - <span>Protection. Understandable.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a></strong> - <span>Speaking of the goddamn devil, I have so much stuff to talk about this one because this one's a literal gamble card. Let's start with the pros: It's a draw power at a cost of a discard, which is great if you can manage to pitch specifically either another <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>, <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>, or <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>, because they can either search you a Fluffal or an Edge Imp monster, a Frightfur card, or to just set up Wings to the GY since you can, respectively, and if you draw specifically a Fluffal monster which consists 35% of your main deck since this is a 42 card list, you get to Special Summon any monster from your hand. The problem is that if your drew anything else, you must send it to the GY, which can only be good if you also specifically drew either another Toy Vendor, Edge Imp Chain (or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>), or Fluffal Wings. There's a way to alleviate this, and that is to fix your hand and stack your deck, by using Edge Imp Sabres' effect which thankfully, is a specific Fusion Material needed for <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>. This card... I'm not saying it's bad, in fact I think it's perfectly balanced... perhaps too perfectly balanced, even.</span></span>  <span>We're not playing any traps in this deck btw. If you wanna play <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, go ahead, feel free to do so.</span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ The Frightfurs (<a data-name=""Frightfur Cruel Whale"">Frightfur Cruel Whale</a>, <a data-name=""Frightfur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightfur Sabre-Tooth</a>, <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>)</strong> - <span>You'll most definitely be summoning both Cruel Whale and Tiger during your opponent's turn with Edge Imp Scythe. I'm only playing Sabre-Tooth because there's an extra space and I really can't play the DPE engine so the slot for Verte Anaconda is not really that worth it, I think. I mean, you can still play Super Polymerization and its targets even if it's at 2 if you want.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> + <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a></strong> - <span>Self-explanatory free negate engine. Allows you to recycle a WATER monster in your GY if it gets sent there.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢Â  <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a></strong> - <span>The DPE + Scythe Lock at home, before the DPE + Scythe Lock was cool and when Pendulums were the only one that uses and abuses it. Same principle as its equivalent, but not as better.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a></strong> - <span>No I am not playing <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>. If you want to be <em><strong>THAT GUY</strong></em>, do it, but not me. Actually to be honest, I think this one's better, because if you or your opponent activates any Spell, it allows you to attach a card of the same card type from your GY as Xyz Material, which is most definitely going to be Toy Vendor, and guess what, if your opponent activates a Spell card, you can negate it by detaching the said Toy Vendor, which also triggers its effect since it got sent to the GY so yeah, screw VFD, play this instead.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></strong> - <span>Free monster negates that are protected by <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, understandable.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a></strong> - <span>Helps Fusion decks in general to either Link Climb, make Xyz plays, or just Fusion spam.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>It should not be surprising. I obviously loved this deck, because first of all, it's a Fusion Deck that can be played either pure or as a toolbox deck. That's always a plus for me because it allows room for deck building creativity. Secondly, it's just as toolbox-y as Shaddolls, and I fucking love Shaddolls for the same reason as the first. And third, I don't know what's with the DUEA era Fusion strategies, or just strategies released in that period in general, man but they just have this level of charm and simplicity to them. They're simple, but not foolproof. They're not complex, but they're not pushovers. They're not straightforward, but not to the point where it gives you choice paralysis. I legitimately think I'll be building this deck too in real life except for the Toad engine because that's still pretty expensive for some reason, all while people are still wasting their money in Branded, which I cannot afford because of the goddamn scalpers but I digress. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

First I apologize for the rambling I wish to only share that I am aware of certain things for my deck.  Cyber Dragon deck that I use in Master Duel and made IRL with my Cyber Dragon deck that I've been slowing putting together for years. I own an Accesscode Talker (was lucky to get the gold version) but I don't own Predaplant Verte Anaconda but I do have plans on trading for a copy. I know of Cyber Revsystem but unfortunately mine got lost in the mail and also have plans on getting it again. I also need more back row removal but can't afford Lightning Storm.  My strategies are: To get Chimertech Rampage Dragon out (Preferably on Power Bond) with Cyber Dragon Seiger as well as Cyber Dragon Infinity, basically hit fast and hard before my opponent can do much. If I can't then I can summon Cyber Eternity Dragon till I can clear my opponent's board."

Even if one of your starting effects get ashed there are usually other things you can do and ways to get your boss machinas or orcust out. Even though the orcust cards lock you into dark machine or just dark monsters that is no problem for Machina Ruinforce going into the next turn since he is dark machine or if you even want to go into Accesscode Talker. The strategy has a handful of ways of setting up your board for disruption. For example, you can end on galatea with machina overdrive set, babel on the field with dingirsu and cymbal skeleton in the gy. Of course you will have to activate overdrive first if you decide to and not the orcust cards first to get the overdrive pop and summon citadel from the deck (or citadel in the gy depending on how you set it up) before you get locked into dark machines and when you do, use cymbal skeleton effect to summon dingirsu from the gy to send an opponents card to the gy or attach an banished machine. In my opinion Machina gearframe, unclaspare, and redeployment are the most important machina cards in the deck since gearframe lets you add a machina like unclaspare, then once unclaspare is added, you use it effect to special summon and send a machina to the graveyard. If you have machina ruinforce or citadel in your hand then dump them with fortress. Go into rank 4 with Gear Gigant, use gigant effect to add Girsu, the orcust mekk-knight, summon fortress from the gy by sending a high enough level machine monster from your hand then link of into galatea and go into your orcust effects after sending an orcust (Orcust knightmare most of the time) to the gy and on your next turn you possibly have enough machine monsters in your gy to go into ruinforce for added otk on your battle phase. Another thing you can do is use the scrap combo which works well if have citadel in the gy. Summon Scrap recycler and send citadel to the gy, send orcust knightmare to the gy by fortress effect, link into Scrap wyvern and use effect to summon back recycler then destroy recycler triggering citadel to summon it, summon scrap golem from the deck then destroy wyvern then use golem effect to summon recycler then send rosenix to the gy, rosenix eff to ss a token, link off into I:P Masquerena (include the token) then intoÂ  Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess. This would however of course with apollousa would be better with a machine monster and overdrive on the field and/or Orcust knightmare in the gy (In which you would have to still have machine monsters in your hand to summon fortress again then link off fortress and knightmare into galatea) to go off into your orcust combos.  Any suggestions and recommendations are welcomed. If there any changes I would make next, I am strongly considering putting in urgent schedule, Heavy freight train derricrane or Express bullet train to make the scrap combo into apollousa more consistent."

This deck can deal with most decks you will find in ranked, as long as they let you go second. Sangan is the second best normal summon that this deck has, most of the time you will search Mekk-knight orange or World legacy chalice, but Maxx c or Ash are great targets when you have enough Mekk-knights already.  Without this deck I wouldn't of been able to get to plat 1 last month, I was playing dinosaur at that time which doesn't match up well against Maxx c or backrow decks and is kind of inconsistent. This deck doesn't really care that the opponent has Summon-limit, Gozen or Skill drain, when you can just hit them with a couple of Mekk-knights each turn and Pot of prosperity for 6 into Lightning storm is always an option. Against good Tri players or Drytron you will need a good hand with specific counters like for Tri (Lightning storm to bait out Revolt and called by for the handtraps they will have drawn), for Drytron (A Kaiju and Lightning storm or Forbidden droplet and Lightning storm)."

Righty Driver Synchro Combo 1</strong> - NS Righty -&gt; SS Lefty (Activate effect to bait Impermance/Veiler) -&gt; LS Halqifibrax -&gt; SS Deskbot 001 -&gt; LS Auroradon -&gt; SS 3 Tokens + Deskbot -&gt; SS Beast-o-Lion (Tribute Auroradon+Token) -&gt; SyS Borreload (Equip Auroradon) + SS Token (Beast-o-Lion effect) -&gt; SyS Herald of the Arc Light End board: Borreload w/ 3 Omni-negate (4050 ATK) + Herald of the Arc Light (Omni-negate + floating effect for Relinquished Ritual Card/Monster)  <strong>2. Righty Driver Synchro Combo 2 (in the case of Beast-o-Lion is in hand since preferably you must never hard draw it)</strong> - NS Righty -&gt; SS Lefty (Activate effect to bait Impermance/Veiler) -&gt; LS Halqifibrax -&gt; SS Deskbot 001 -&gt; LS Auroradon -&gt; SS 3 Tokens + Deskbot -&gt; SyS Baronne de Fleur (3 Token + Deskbot) End board: Baronne de Fleur (1 Targeting Destruction + 1 Omni-negate) + Auroradon (Can be Linked into Accesscode if it survive the opponents turn)  <strong>3. Interrupted Kaiju Combo 1 (Tuner on hand except for Righty Driver)</strong> - Activate Interrupted Kaiju Slumber -&gt; SS Radian on Opponent side, Machine Kaiju on your side -&gt; NS Tuner -&gt; Either go into Baronne/Borreload depending on starting draw Endboard: Borreload+Herald/Auroradon+Baronne  <strong>4. Interrupted Kaiju Combo 2 (No Tuner on hand)</strong> - Activate Interrupted Kaiju Slumber -&gt; SS Radian on Opponent side, any Kaiju on your side -&gt; NS Monster -&gt; LS Verte -&gt; Verte Effect FS Starving Venom Endboard: Starving Fusion Venom Dragon (Non-targeting Destruction for SS'd monsters if destroyed on the field)  <strong>5. Relinquished Bait Combo (If we can Ritual Summon Relinquished with Relinquished fusion in hand)</strong> - RS Relinquished -&gt; Absorb one 1 targetable opponent monster -&gt; Attack or go into MP2 -&gt; Set Relinquished Fusion -&gt; Opponents Standby Phase/Main Phase, Activate Relinquished Fusion -&gt; FS Millennium-Eyes -&gt; if opponent activates monster effect, activate Millennium-Eyes effects to negate and absorb the card (Better to absorb their starter or any problematic cards) Endboard: Millenium-Eyes Restrict (1 Monster Negate)  As stated above, there are a lot of combo lines possible, and you can even combine some of them for a decent end board with 3 negates (<em>Borreload+Herald+Millenium-Eyes</em>) or even OTKs in some cases. Union Driver can bring out Illusionist Faceless as an insurance to allow Relinquished/Millennium-Eyes to bounce back from GY or even equip a <em>Buster Dragon Destruction</em> to any of your boss monster to lock opponents off the Extra Deck.  The deck is <em>very</em> susceptible to <em>Nibiru</em> (as with other combo decks) as we summon a lot of monsters during our turn, though enemies top decking <em>Nibiru</em> if they have only 1 copy is rare, nonetheless the threat is still there. In this case, we can always summon Relinquished last to absorb <em>Nibiru</em>, ending with a big stat stick token, and a 3000 ATK Relinquished.  <em>Ash</em> and <em>Maxx C</em> can be manageable, if we draw into Called by the Grave.  We can also reduce some Kaijus and Tuners to include a few copies of Ash Blossom or add a few more going second cards like <em>Lightning Storm</em> or <em>Evenly Matched</em>.  &nbsp;"

Wind Pegasus: Clears backrow, also has a bounce effect  Light Dragon: Protection for links, SS a link from grave if another cyberse monster deals damage to your opponent  Monster Reborn: I feel like it  Eagle Booster: Good protection  2 Hiyari vs. 1: I love drawing the card and it is a nice extender.

As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>  <span>Edit: I've cut <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> to make room for <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>, because this deck can actually repeatedly Scythe lock your opponent, provided that you have enough LP to do so every turn through <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>.</span>  <span>Another Edit: I've brought back Ukoback because I got a nightmare last night that made me remember that all Barrier Statues not only have different Attributes but also Types, and what do you know, <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Heavens"">Barrier Statue of the Heavens</a> is a LIGHT Fairy. I've also cut Magicians' Souls for testing purposes.</span>"

For the Kali Yuga lock, all you need is Kepler, Swirl Slime, and any other D/D monster in hand, which is pretty easy to get because of the amount of searches this deck (and D/D as an archetype) has.  Kali Yuga lock combo: <ul>  	<li>Summon Kepler, search Dark Contract with the Gate, use that to search a fourth monster. Or, if you already have a fourth via something like drawing with Allure of Darkness, or already have Gate in hand, search Dark Contract with the Swamp King.</li>  	<li>Use Swirl Slime and 1 monster to Fusion Summon Genghis.</li>  	<li>Banish Swirl Slime to summon the fourth monster from hand.</li>  	<li>Genghis procs, summon the monster from GY.</li>  	<li>Summon Dagda, then Gilgamesh.</li>  	<li>Using Gilgamesh, place Orthros and Thomas in pend scales.</li>  	<li>Use Thomas to add Kepler back to hand.</li>  	<li>Use Orthros to pop Thomas and any other card.</li>  	<li>Put Kepler into Pend Scale.</li>  	<li>Pend Summon Thomas, and use Thomas to summon Abyss Ragnarok.</li>  	<li>Using Ragnarok and Thomas, go into Kali Yuga.</li>  	<li>Wait for opponents Draw Phase, pop Scythe, and now you've scythe-locked your opponent with D/D/D.</li> </ul> Pretty big combo but its really easy to do, just a bunch of steps not too much thinking. This also sets up future plays with Kali Yuga to grab Swamp King back from the GY, then use it to Fusion Summon something like Caesar Ragnarok. On turn 3 I've had huge boards set up with this, my best being Caesar Ragnarok, Purple Armageddon, Kali Yuga, Siegfried, High King Genghis, and Abyss Ragnarok. Traded the Purple Armageddon for a second Gilgamesh though, just to be able to get monsters from Field to Grave easier in case anything gets messed up."

Chain block Lubellion's fusion summon effect with Despian Tragedy to bring out Mirrorjade. Use Mirrorjade to banish a monster and send Albion to set Branded in Red in the end phase. In draw phase of the next turn, activate Branded in Red to summon Masquerade using Mirrorjade and Ad Libitum and then re-summon Mirrorjade using the effect of Ad Libitum. 1 banish and a bunch of burn damage if it works out.  Three Kitt in this deck because I'm poor and can't afford Aluber but she essentially serves the same purpose of searching any of the branded spell/traps that you need, also helps cycle some of the garnets back into the deck. Keeper of Dragon Magic does the same except sucks more.  Dogmatika Package helps send the Shaddoll stuff to the grave and adds bodies to the field. Helps send N'tss if needing a pop.  Only one Ash Blossom because I'm poor. The other hand traps help survive. This deck is deathly allergic to spell and trap removal. Monster negates are all up in here though  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I'm probably dead wrong with this list. &nbsp; There are inherent non-synergies within the list. Obviously, Rivalry + Zombie World locks you out of your non-zombies too. The idea is that this should hurt your opponent much more than you. This deck can go first or second. It's a little awkward when you have your going second pieces going first and vice-versa but this deck was made to both be good at clearing boards and also meant to have fairly strong starts / be able to set up locks. Like I said, this is my take on it. Feel free to criticize and suggest changes.</p>"

It can special summon itself to make for Tribute material, you can Tribute summon it for Domain's effect or combo it with Stormforth to get rid of an opponent's card, its discard effect is good backrow removal and a way to get Pantheism or Prime into the GY, and it can act as a serviceable body if you brick and just want to have something on the field.  2 copies of Majesty's Fiend because its 2400/1000 stats allows it to use Tenacity of the Monarchs and Return of the Monarchs, and 3 Vanity's Fiend because its effect is incredibly powerful even though it doesn't have the Monarch stats.  Seleglare can be searched by Ehther, and its effect can be useful for getting a low-atk card away from your opponent for a turn. It can also use Tenacity and Return.  I choose Proof of Pruflas over Squires or Vassals because Ash Blossom can't stop Proof like it can Edea, and I often found myself bricking because I'd draw multiple Squires or cards that search Edea (like RotA or One For One) but no tribute monsters.  Change of Heart was unbanned, and I can see that being great for getting tribute fodder."

Being one of the one of the win conditions for this deck, these cards can create <em>Zeus</em> and <em>Number F0 â Utopic Draco Future</em> with just two level 3 monsters. Ghostrick Shot is recyclable with Alucard, giving you a monster reborn for Ghostricks every turn so they can serve as materials to make your Extra Deck bosses. Ghostrick Shot also turns into a 3 material Zeus, as explained later in the combo section. <ul>  	<li>The <strong>Staple</strong> cards in the maindeck consists of 10 cards:</li> </ul> <em>3 Crossout Designator</em> and its targets; <em>1 Impermanence, 1 Nibiru, 1 Droll and Lockbird, 1 Artifact Lancea, 1 Effect Veiler, 1 Called by the Grave and 1 Forbidden Droplet</em>. Designator can also negate the commonly used Adventurer cards, if your opponent happens to use it.  This deck is 52 cards so that there is the least possible chance to draw into this deckâs 7 bricks: Ghostrick Shot, P.U.N.K Dangerous Gabu, Wandering Gryphon Rider, Fateful Adventure, Dracoback, D-Hero Celestial and D-Hero Dasher. If you draw Ghostrick Shot, the Utopic Draco Future combo is dead. While drawing most bricks wouldnât be catastrophic, it is less than ideal â hence the 52 card deck.  I intentionally didnât include Auroradon/Deskbot 001 combo in here, since I anticipate it will be on the future banlist. I also think that Anaconda and the Adventurer Engine will get affected by the future banlist, but these two synergize with the deck so much I had to use it.  A card to add for consideration in R3NK Adventurer is <em>Small World</em>, since it easily searches <em>Aquamancer of the Sanctuary</em> with any level 3 in the deck. Another engine to add can be Illusion of Chaos + Magician Souls for extra draw power and another free body on board.  &nbsp; <p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p> The gameplan with this deck is to spam the board with as much level 3s as possible, then proceed to turbo out boss monsters from the Extra Deck. Any two level 3s monsters make Utopic Draco Future, Accesscode, Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, and Zeus.  Ideally, this deck likes to go first so it can make a board, interrupt the opponent, then OTK the turn afterwards. Going second this deck can easily turbo out a 4 material Zeus or play through interruption to OTK with Accesscode.  <strong>GOING FIRST,</strong> the R3NK duelist can make a board consisting of Utopic Draco Future, DPE, with perhaps some handtraps in the hand. If a hand is amazing, the end board can also consist of Baronne or an intact Adventurer Token + Gryphon Rider combo.  Everybody and their mom already know the Adventurer, DPE and Halq/Accesscode combo, so Iâll only be explaining the combos to make Utopic Draco Future and Baronne.  <strong>2 level 3 monsters -&gt; Utopic Draco Future:</strong> <ol>  	<li>XYZ summon Ghostrick Alucard using the two level 3 monsters.</li>  	<li>Overlay Ghostrick Angel of Mischief on Alucard.</li>  	<li>Detach Ghostrick Alucard from Angel of Mischief to search Ghostrick Shot from deck.</li>  	<li>Activate Ghostrick Shot to resurrect Alucard from GY.</li>  	<li>Overlay Ghostrick Angel of Mischief on Alucard.</li>  	<li>XYZ Summon Number F0: Utopic Future. Alucard will activate once sent to the GY, and retrieve Ghostrick Shot from GY (follow-up for next turn).</li>  	<li>Overlay Number F0: Utopic Draco Future on Utopic Future. (With leftover material on board, you can make Baronne, Anaconda-&gt;DPE, or if going second, go for Zeus/Accesscode).</li> </ol> <strong>Adventurer Engine + Level 3 Tuner -&gt; Baronne: </strong>  Creating <strong>Baronne</strong> is hand/situation dependent, but this deck can still make her fairly regularly. There are two ways to create Baronne, and both involve using up leftovers of the Adventurer Engine: <ol>  	<li>Any level 3 tuner + Gryphon Rider creates Baronne. If Baronne uses up her negate, she can tag back into Gryphon Rider during standby phase for another omni-negate!</li>  	<li>Alternatively, the level 4 Adventurer token + level 3 tuner + level 3 non-tuner can make Baronne.</li> </ol> <strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, the R3NK duelist can slow down the opposing player with handtraps then break the board with Zeus. The battling monster of choice here is Fortune Tune since it has protection. After the battle phase it can be overlayed by our favourite Zeus pilot Downerd Magician for an extra Zeus activation. Once the board is reset, you have a choice of building your board as if youâre going first.  <strong>Ghostrick Shot is a 1 card 3 material Zeus</strong> if Alucard is already in the GY. This set-up (Alucard in GY and Shot in hand) is usually accomplished the turn after you create Utopic Draco Future. The combo is as follows: Shot resurrects Alucard -&gt; Banish Shot to attach a Ghostrick card from GY to Alucard. Overlay Alucard -&gt;Downerd-&gt;Attack -&gt; Zeus. This turns Ghostrick Shot into a 1 card fieldwipe!  If you feel confident you can OTK, this deck can play through interruptions, generate 8000+ ATK and easily clear the board with Gryphon Riderâs bounce, Baronneâs destruction effect and Accesscodeâs multiple destructions so you can swing for game!  &nbsp; <p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li>Before you start off with your opening plays, try to bait out your opponentâs handtraps/interruption by using the Adventurer cards first.</li>  	<li>Donât forget that Crossout Designator can negate other staple cards as long as the same cards are present in your deck â notable examples being Called by the Grave, Rite of Aramesia and Destiny Hero Celestial.</li>  	<li>If all your plays are stopped, try to at least get two monsters on field so you can make Anaconda -&gt; DPE. If you survive until next turn, you can potentially make a comeback with the +2 draw and special summon that Celestial and Dasher provide in the GY.</li>  	<li>Once you complete making your Utopic Draco Future, you can use your Adventurer Token + Gryphon Rider to make Anaconda-&gt;DPE. If your opponent tries to stop Anaconda, Utopic Draco Future will negate their handtrap!</li>  	<li>A Baronne with a spent negate can tag back into Gryphon Rider during Standby Phase for another omni-negate, given that the Adventurer Token is still on the field. Also, if you want to play offensively, she can tag back into a tuner you can make Halq -&gt; Accesscode!</li>  	<li>Unfortunately, this deck is ridiculously expensive ($1200USD as of this writing) and there are stronger ways to use the boss monsters in R3NK Adventurer in other decks (Swordsoul or B.A.S.E.D for example).</li>  	<li>This deck loses hard to floodgates like Gozen Match and Skill Drain. This deckâs answer to these floodgates is Dracoback. If facing a floodgate-based opponent, be sure to side in backrow removal.</li> </ul> <p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p> After watching MBTâs Youtube Ghostrick video on Youtube (check him out, heâs hilarious), it has motivated me to create my own rank 3 spam creation. After MBT issued a challenge for another duelist to put the Ghostrick -&gt; Utopic Draco Future combo in another deck, so I took it!  Also, Iâve been playing too much JRPGs, and the I wanted to create a deck based on the stereotypical questing party â with R3NK Adventurer being the result! I strongly believe in projecting my imagination in my duels with the things I like since it greatly enhances my love of the game, so I imagine every duel with R3NK Adventurer as an exciting journey to defeat the villains (nerdy I know lol)! Baronne, DPE, Utopic Draco Future, Accesscode and Zeus are all members of your questing party, ready to destroy your enemies in your mission to win duels!  I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online and IRL. And with that, Iâm taking this deck to Locals this week, wish me luck! Thatâll be all for now, GLHF Duelists!  &nbsp;"

Well the saints on the day of our lord had came to me to give some reprieve on that solution, and they told me to try it on HEROs. Now while this archetype has a long track record of having some of the most laughably bad monsters, spells, and overall track records out of any anime based archetype that came out of the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise; it is needless to say that most of the archetypes that came out of the original Yu-Gi-Oh animes (DM, GX, 5Ds, and Zexal) were all either lackluster or straight up bad up until after their initial airings. However HEROs tend to be more of a tragedy of their own, mainly because of how archaic the fusion summoning was up until this point; the fact that it took many years for HEROs to get solid support it needs to speed itself up; and the fact that it had multiple banlist hits from <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> to even the grand jewel of all fusion cards, <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>.  Now to note on where and why I think that HERO will be one of the few fusion decks to survive against the banning of <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a>is quite simple: it's because this deck doesn't simply run need to run it at all. Arguably, I can say that the reason it was in HERO builds to begin with was to further increase versatility and speed at board building. Truthfully however even without it the speed has taken a slight dip, but doesn't mean that the versatility from the snek has left them. Especially now with Despia and Branded builds running around, the opportunity for HEROs to approach the situations at its pace has come; hence why I have with two silver bullets that can be used for Super Polymerization: <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> (as one can wipe boards ASAP, and the other can snipe potential threats from any Dark monsters a quick pace). Next part involves what changes I added for the maindeck as a whole (to which there isn't too many, the ones I made are quite decent nontheless). First off instead of Celestial and Dasher, comes Malicious and Denier; simply because I find this to be a lot more consistent than to wait and pray for an empty hand. Next comes the introduction of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Drawhand"">Destiny HERO - Drawhand</a>: one of the newer Destiny HERO monsters (released in 2020) that if special summoned by an effect of a HERO monster (which is a lot likely), you and your opponent can draw a card; but if this triggers with <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> on the field, he banishes one random card from your opponents hand. Then comes the addition of <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> because I'm not playing a lot of handtraps. Finally, there is nothing really serious that changed about this deck at all, and until it happens that either branded expands into opening itself more than the Dark/Light attribute, or there is someone that can make HEROs into a defensive deck; this might be where they be stuck being for a very long time..."

I made this deck purely just for fun and testing the flexible summoning potential. Every monster card can fuse with or into one another  Only downside I seem to have with this playstyle is while you can easily get out 2-4 monsters and/or fusions on any given turn, you can sometimes end up having an empty hand (which hinders Paladins negate effect unable to be activated)  I've tried adding draw power cards like Maxx C and other various options, but I found that bringing out ""The Dark magicians"" fusion is more consistent for getting cards to hand.  I enjoy playing with this deck and I'm always open to feedback and suggestions to make this even better  Enjoy!"

With <strong>Prediction Princess</strong> being relatively low-profile to most players, especially the players who've been introduced to the game through Master Duel, nobody truly understands how to play against it effectively until they start using their brain and actually read your cards. Because <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong> doesn't have an Effect that triggers upon it being flipped face-up, despite it being a Flip Monster, your opponents, who have never seen the card before, will usually not realize that it is basically a one-sided <strong>Skill Drain</strong>. Due to this, you can cheese a lot of games strictly because your opponent refused to read. <strong>Prediction Princess</strong> is a really fun Ritual Deck which revolves around <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> and you aim to utilize <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>, <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong>, and an assortment of Rank 9 Monsters to run your opponent out of resources and plays.</span>  <span>We run 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> because she is the centerpoint of the Deck. During the End Phase, she Summons a Flip Monster from your hand or GY and as HOPT and only 1 Effect per turn, you can flip a monster on the field face-down or flip one face-up. Not only does this activate the Effects of your Flip Monsters, but it can also prevent some of your opponent's Extra Deck Summons by flipping a key monster face-down. 3 <strong>Impcantation Chalislime</strong>. This card basically Summons an <strong>Impcantation</strong> from Deck at the cost of pitching 1 card (which can be itself), and you usually do not have to worry about the 2500 burn during the End Phase since you are most likely Ritual Summoning right after anyways. It gives you greater access to your <strong>Impcantations</strong> for Ritual Monsters and Spells and it can be searched off of<strong> Preparation of Rites</strong> which is great. 1 <strong>Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</strong>. If your opponent targets a monster you control with an Effect, you can discard this to negate that. <strong>Tarotrei</strong> is a prime target for removal and negation because she enables all of your plays. <strong>Sauravis</strong> can protect her from <strong>Effect Veiler</strong>, <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, <strong>Paleozoic Dinomischus</strong>, or basically anything relevant that targets. It can easily be cut for gem reasons, but if you have it, it is just another layer of protection. 3 <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> of course as a staple. 3 <strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong>.<strong> Tarotrei</strong> needs at least 1 Flip Monster in rotation for her to do her magic and because you usually never Normal Summon in this Deck, <strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong> is a good choice for those reasons as it searches Flip Monsters upon Normal Summon. 3 <strong>Impcantation Talismandra</strong> and 2 <strong>Impcantation Candoll</strong>. <strong>Talismandra</strong> searches Ritual Monsters and <strong>Candoll</strong> searches Spells and because<strong> Impcantations</strong> can Summon each other from Deck, because we are running more Ritual Monsters, running more <strong>Talismandra</strong> means more access to <strong>Candoll</strong> and Ritual Spells. 2 <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong> and 2 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>. <strong>Deus X</strong> is a one-sided <strong>Skill Drain</strong> as long as it remains face-up after being flipped and it can search<strong> Tarotrei</strong> if it is destroyed. <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> is a HOPT <strong>Pot of Greed</strong>,<strong> Giant Trunade</strong>, <strong>Raigeki</strong>, or <strong>The Forceful Sentry</strong>. Usually, you are using the <strong>Giant Trunade</strong> Effect to go for game or the <strong>Raigeki</strong> Effect to board wipe. The <strong>Pot of Greed</strong> Effect rarely does come up, but <strong>The Forceful Sentry</strong> Effect is good for preventing your opponent from potentially gaining advantage while you are in a winning board state. More often, you would like to see <strong>Deus X</strong> more than <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> since<strong> Deus X</strong>'s one-sided<strong> Skill Drain</strong> is much stronger than something like a <strong>Raigeki</strong> from <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>, but they are the 2 best Level 9 Flip Monsters so it's fine.</span>  <span>For the Spells/Traps, 3 <strong>Pre-preparation of Rites</strong> and 2 <strong>Preparation of Rites</strong>. <strong>Pre-prep</strong> searches out <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> so 3 is most optimal. As for <strong>Prep</strong>, it searches either <strong>Chalislime</strong> or <strong>Sauravis</strong> and it can recycle a Ritual Spell if need be, but as it doesn't get you immediate access to <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, 3 can be bricky. 3 <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> which Summons <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. Also, on the turn that it wasn't sent to the GY, it can banish itself to add a <strong>Tarotrei</strong> to hand. This reduces the need to constantly see <strong>Impcantations</strong> and <strong>Pre-preps</strong>, so that is pretty nice. 1 <strong>Impcantation Inception</strong>. This card basically is a 4th copy of <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> if the situation ever comes up. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> as it is just an all-round great searcher card. 3 <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which Summons 2 Level 9's (<strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> and <strong>Deus X</strong>) from Deck if you target <strong>Tarotrei</strong> with it. This can give immediate access to a Rank 9 or it can be used to put Flip Monsters into rotation for <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. Also something to keep in mind is that you can Book 1 monster Summoned by <strong>Monstrosity</strong> to prevent it from being destroyed during the End Phase. <span>However, despite the destruction during the End Phase being mandatory, in Master Duel, it actually happens after the window in which you are allowed to activate <span><strong>Tarotrei</strong></span>'s End Phase Effect, so you will not be able to Summon the other monster back which is really unfortunate</span>. However, the destruction will trigger <strong>Deus X</strong> which allows him to search a <strong>Tarotrei</strong> for next Turn. Lastly, we have 3 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.<strong> Imperm</strong> cannot be banished by <strong>Called by the Grave</strong> in the same way <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> can be, so it is a better card for disruption.</span>  <span>The Extra Deck has 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future</strong>, and 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</strong>. These are great cards to go with Xyz Decks, but you can definitely only choose to play the 1 <strong>Zeus</strong> for budget reasons. 3 <strong>Number 92; Heart-eartH Dragon</strong>. This card is usually fodder for <strong>Prosperity</strong>, but it is pretty hard to out if you do ever make it unless your opponent is actively running removal. 2 <strong>Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir</strong>. This card is removal, and just like <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>'s <strong>The Forceful Sentry Effect</strong>, it can be used to hinder your opponent further while you are in a winning game state. 3 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>. This card is absolutely insane for removal. 3 <strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>. This is mainly just for budget purposes, but its revival Effects can come in handy. 1 <strong>True King of All Calamities</strong> which is absolutely insane because it was banned in the TCG and OCG for a reason. I would advise against playing <strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> because it doesn't accomplish much in this Deck other than being a beefy body. Another potential Rank 9 you can play is <strong>Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</strong>, but you would rather make that early in the game which this Deck usually falls to Xyz later on in the game.</span>  <span>More cards I would recommend playing would be <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> since this Deck isn't the greatest trying to break a massive negation board without help. <strong>Called by the Grave</strong> is good against <strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Veiler</strong>, and <strong>Droll</strong>. <strong>Maxx ""C""</strong> is great for draw power which is very useful in a Ritual Deck. <strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> is a free Level 9 monster on board if there is a monster in the EMZ and it can act as removal for your opponent's monster in the EMZ. It gives good Rank 9 access and is pretty good removal. <strong>Kaijus</strong> are another great choice for this Deck. <strong>Thunder King</strong> and <strong>Mecha-Thunder-King</strong> are the only Level 9 Kaijus and both are Summonable off of <strong>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> and both give Rank 9 access. <strong>Mecha-Thunder-King</strong> can also bring itself back during the End Phase as a OPD and it can act as another body on the field or Rank 9 access for next turn. <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> is great because you can get back a <strong>Tarotrei</strong> your opponent destroyed. <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong> and<strong> Lightning Storm</strong> are good against backrow and so is <strong>Red Reboot</strong>. This Deck only has access to backrow removal in the Extra Deck, so having some options in the Main Deck is good if you can afford it. <strong>Whirlwind Weasel</strong> and <strong>Guard Dog</strong> are <strong>Imperial Order</strong>/<strong>Royal Decree</strong> and <strong>Vanity's Emptiness</strong> respectively, but they are not that optimal to run as it hurts consistency massively and they can be seen as more of a hinderance than an asset.</span>"

It's pretty obvious that the ban list is quite different in Master Duel than it was in the TCG or OCG at this point in comparable metas, and in many ways it is quite favourable to the deck. Drytron is literally full power, and the archetype already has a lot going for it - Heralds are obviously really strong, Benten abuse is insane, Eva is nuts, and it can toolbox the extra deck to really play to what you like, or already own. There are a couple of big downsides to the deck, namely Skill Drain monke Eldlich, but much more importantly, the strong presence of Maxx ""C"", as well as Gamma's increased presence despite a semi-limit (BO1 means you have to main the tech). So, it's a struggle - you literally can't run enough outs for Skill Drain and Maxx ""C"" at the same time, particularly with the pretty close to required number of consistency cards and combo pieces. However, there's a really strong reward if you could solve those problems. This version is a compromise leaning on the ""dodge Lich"" side, which loses hard to Droll but has pretty solid game against Maxx ""C"". You could consider different ratios, depending on what you see, where you are on the ladder, and your own playstyle. I will be making suggestions for alternatives, budget options, and cards to consider.  Drytron, for the uninitiated, is a combo deck based on abusing Drytron monsters and generic Fairy ritual support from a variety of archetypes. Your basic goal is to use Drys to tribute Benten as many times as possible to get as many searches as possible, and you're trying to ritual summon a Herald as early in the combo as feasible to protect the combo while holding up interruptions. Your final goal is to fill your hand using Eva, which can be sent from the deck in a variety of ways.  So, I want to talk about interruptions. Obviously, beating Maxx ""C"" is important to me. I usually rely on around 5-7 cards to beat Maxx ""C"". This list is quite in the middle, on 6. Herald of the Orange Light is like Gamma without the restrictions or the brick... For a cost, which is pitching a Fairy. You search these throughout the combo, as a back-up in case Herald gets Kaiju'd or something. But they're also really here to be your anti-handtrap cards. In order to facilitate these, we are also running 14 Fairies, 3 Heralds and 11 other cards. You could run Called By, which would give you some game against random Drolls, and it would be good - I decided it conflicted too much with the 1 of Extra-Foolish, and that I'd rather run Ash on the basis of being an actual hand trap, wheras the other interaction spots are filled by Spell/Trap removal to answer floodgates. Maybe I get Ordered, but at least I can out the Skill Drain. I'm also on 2 Lancea, high impact in some matchups, at least useful in most, and it helps meet the criteria for having random Fairies in my hand for Orange Light. You could maybe get away with running Called By over Lancea, but I'd suggest running 1, because it can be game sometimes, and you can just search it. I think when you're deciding what hand traps to run, you have to be really worried about being able to out most floodgates, and have game against Maxx ""C"", and I don't think there's space for a ton of interaction in the deck. Gamma is another great option in this deck, especially if you're hurt for Ultys.  So, for Dry names I'm on 2 Alpha, 2 Zeta, 1 Gamma, and 1 Delta. Alpha Zeta is full combo, and it is insane, but you have so many consistency cards, both in the main and in the Extra deck. You're going to full combo with a ROTA + either Alpha or Zeta, whereas 2 Alphas are just sad Alphas. In total we have 10 consistency cards that search out your missing Dry name - 3 Cyber Emergency, best ROTA, 1 Foolish Burial, cause Drys are insane, 2 Nova and 2 Fafnir, with the basis being seeing either of these in multiple are bad, but they're slightly better as a pair, and each is better in different situations even though they're both effectively copies of your HOPT Nova, and 2 Mathematician, the decks main NS starter. Mathman is run over Scrap Recycler here because it can send Eva in addition to Drys, but recycler has applications if you want to use Scrap Wyvern into Nightmare Unicorn going second, so if you have Wyvern there are upsides to running Recycler. I do think access to Eva is way more important. Also, Recycler is a fine budget option - 90% of the time corporate can't tell the difference. There may be hands where you don't want to start with Mathman - your basic combo can search out Diviner of the Heralds for great value, which also helps make Beatrice, and in addition if you don't need Mathman to get plays started, holding onto it to send Eva or play through an interuption is probably correct anyways. Diviner is a fine combo starter in its own right, if you have Zeta you send Arc Light to search Benten, if you have Alpha you send Arc Light for the Ritual Spell. We're running 2 of the Ritual spell, because A) you do need this to do your combo and do want to just see it sometimes, and B) you can search out and use multiple copies of the ritual spell, or even hold a copy for follow-ups.  The next part of the deck is just 5 copies of Benten. You want to hard see Benten, and in the absence of Benten you want ways to search Benten. If you don't have Benten it is optimal so search Benten. If you're searching with Benten, Benten searches for Benten, and it is sometimes correct to just chain Benten. We're running a 1/1 mix of Prep and Extra-Foolish. Prep is great, and you could consider 2, but I've found often you can't pick up 2 Ritual spells when you see both copies of Prep anyways, and when you can you can rarely use the spell for much anyways. Plus, the first copy of Extra-Foolish may put us off Called By and occasionally gimp Cosmic, but it is also access to the Ritual spell, which really is the secret key to unlocking this deck, how do I get the ritual spell, as well as high-level rituals, such as Herald of Ultimateness, and occasionally the Drytron 12s (its a ritual you can search that you can tribute to ritual summon, then ritual summon from the GY...)  There's a small Cyber Angel package here. Idaten is crazy, you can abuse Idaten to ritual summon so many times and just Link climb and make Xyz monsters. Natasha is for the grind game, a tool to link climb into Accesscode for a big finish, but also weirdly fine as this sort of passive value engine. It's way better in a world with 3 Benten, and people swear by it with 1. Ultimateness could be Perfection if you're looking for a budget option - it is effectively doing the same thing. While it is worse in many ways that actually literally do really matter, it's also just so busted despite that that in most games you won't notice. Its also searchable with Prep, if you're on 2 or 3 Prep (it's still fine, it's not a HOPT). Likewise for the Drytron ritual - the Ulty is way better as a card, but the Secret is fine and has fringe utility, and 90% of the time corporate can't tell the difference. Its literally just searchable tribute fodder. For Ultys in the main you literally only need 1 Diviner, and 1 of the Ritual spell, if you're looking to start out in Master Duel - in the Extra deck you'll want to build a good collection of pretty generic extra-deck cards most likely, but in a pinch I'd say you only really need 1 Beatrice, 1 Herald of the Arc Light, 1 Mu Beta Fafnir, and 1 Linkuriboh - if you have to choose 1 choose Beatrice, not because it is that good in any other deck (BA? more like BO) but because it is core here. After that, you can fill the deck with whatever generic Link monsters you have - the real goal is just Ultimateness negates, as long as you can Link Idaten away after searching a bunch with Benten and making Ultimateness/Perfection you're doing it right ;)  I think the deck has some meta-game challenges that make it exciting to deck build, but a lot harder to play than in the TCG. But in terms of pure unadulterated power it is hard to get better than Drytron, and I do think the format has the tools for Drytron to be a contender within it. I also think that while it is a slightly complicated deck at first, it is actually pretty quick to pick up and very rewarding to play. I'd also call it a good budget entry option to Master Duel for experienced Yu-Gi-Oh! players interested in Master Duel, but not looking to spend a lot of money."

That said; however, the deck's still all kinds of fun to pilot and use to navigate gamestates that most other decks would have issues with. You play an answer to every situation in the Extra Deck with this build and if it's missing, it can probably just be teched in over something else!  <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Easy Starts</span>: Buzzsaw Shark or a combination of any two cards that summon themselves out gets you rolling. Your opening play should always consist of making a Rank 4 either disrupt or defend going first.</li>  	<li><span>Interaction</span>: Since the deck's lines all just primarily feature ways to turbo Rank 4s, a good chunk of the deck's dedicated to simple interaction in the form of staples and handtraps.</li>  	<li><span>7 Colored Fish?</span>: It's a Normal Monster- which helps with getting around the summon limit in a lot of instances! Due to this status, it's also synergistic with some alternative choices in deck building that we'll cover by the end.</li> </ul> <strong>Cons:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Rank 4 Chunkiness</span>: If you fail to open Buzzsaw Shark (or it gets disrupted) or fail to find an extender in addition to a normal summon, you'll be behind by quite a bit. While this isn't a super common occurrence, it can set you back in a duel pretty far. Fortunately, the toolbox options in the Extra Deck help with comebacks.</li>  	<li><span>Specific Extenders</span>:Â  To improve the ability to turbo out Rank 4s more consistently by turn 1, some cards like Ice Knight, Goblindberg, Kagetokage, and ZS Armed Sage were added and while they absolutely do their job perfectly, a good portion of the deck tends to conflict with some of their effects. It's important to keep these in mind when determining the starter for each line, especially if you happen to have Silent Sea Nettle or Silent Angler in hand!</li>  	<li><span>Prone to Disruption</span>: Most decks will want to interact with you by your second summon, before the Xyz touches down. Sometimes they'll interact with you on the Xyz Summon itself. Either way, when this happens and you don't have follow-up in the form of an extender, it can be quite rough. It's one of the caveats of playing a pseudo-traditional Xyz strategy in a format with capped summons.</li> </ul> Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.  <hr />  <strong>OPENERS</strong>  The hand quality and/or number of extenders in the hand will always make the permuations of the gamestates more or less challenging to emulate; though, this much was obvious. That being said, in the 1st turns of the duel, you ideally just want to have a conga line of Xyzs rolling out. This can be enabled by the following: <ul>  	<li><strong>Defensive Line: Having Hope:Â </strong>Leading with Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark isn't the worst thing you can do, especially if it's made using Buzzsaw Shark. Being able to threaten a 1k drop across the board on top of resurrecting your one card starter makes it exert some pressure while also doubling as a decent attacker. It shines best alongside others or backrow.</li>  	<li><strong>Exosister Avatar:</strong> The introduction of Exosisters left much to be desired for their status in Trinity; however, their Xyz Monsters are great if you have the space. With Traptrix Rafflesia gone and this list not featuring Bagooska, if you're aiming to prevent a specific aspect of your opponent's gameplan, then turboing Mikailis is up your alley. Pick up the Exosister Arment and set it. During your opponent's turn you can either tag into Usophiel who prevents GY effects (and if she survives, is just a compulse) or Jibrine who is more of a supportive card to help you push for early lethal if your opponent's off to a slow start. If you happen to open Arment, simply make Jibrine instead and open up the option of tagging into Mikailis for her Quick Effect banish! Kaspitell's also great, but is more specific to certain match-ups.</li>  	<li><strong>Post-Siding Negation Snowball:</strong> The other two options are really solid and should cover most of your average experiences with the deck; however, post-siding, if you notice that your opponent's list is extremely reliant on Monster Effects to resolve to get their engines rolling, you can opt to side in The Iris Swordsoul, Giant Hand, Ice Barrier, and the Ice-Bound God. These cards all serve as very easy ways to prevent those effects from going off while also generating a lot of pressure and recurring advantage in some way (besides Giant Hand). Paleozoic Marrella and Swordsoul Emergence help get to each of these side strategies faster.</li> </ul> As you can tell, the openers and lines can be pretty linear. Most of the advanced tactics comes from summon management using the non-Effect Monsters and choosing the right Xyz for the job. Rarely will your opponent be generous enough to give you a second or third chance at answering their board.  <strong>MIDGAME &amp; CLOSERS </strong>  There's only a few real setups to aim for if you find yourself in the midgame grind or aim to end the game outright. <ul>  	<li><strong>Drill Driver Vespenato: </strong>This card's basically another copy of Number 37; however, it's also a piercer! Its utility usually comes up whenever you unfortunately cannot find Whitefish Salvage nor Avarice.</li>  	<li><strong>Valiant Shark Lancer: </strong>This card when paired with Abyss Dweller or Number 37 can easily close out games pretty quickly. Unfortunately, due to its Rank being 5, the setups for it are mostly specific to Buzzsaw Shark, Lantern Shark, and Penguin Squire. However, if achieved successfully, you have now earned yourself a Quick-Effect monster pop. Usually an opponent should aim to take out your Dweller or Number 37 because it turns of Valiant from being a Quick-Effect and removes both forms of pressure at once. When this happens, you'll be able to stack your deck with any sacky option of your choice. I recommend White Mirror, Whitefish Salvage, Pot of Avarice, Instant Fusion, and Monster Reborn.</li>  	<li><strong>Graydle Dragon:</strong> This isn't super consistent to pull off but can be a bit easier if you side in the Ice Barrier engine to find Squire more often. When Graydle Dragon resolves in this deck, you should almost always be using it to clear two cards. Don't settle for just one, Tornado Dragon or Light Dragon @Ignister can do that instead. Graydle Dragon also being able to float is massive as well- although the monster will just be a generic material more than anything else.</li> </ul> Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame. The grind game in this deck isn't the best per se.  <hr />  While simple in nature, the deck's playstyle favors decision-making and proper risk assessment for problem solving. There's no Numeron Dragon OTK for you to get out of situations easily. Things will have to take patience and proper identification of win conditions to achieve consistent victories with this deck. Here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:  <em>Tenyi Core, Piercing the Darkness, Dogmatika, Dinosaur, Traptrix Myrmeleo, Super Team Buddy Force Unite!!, Performage Core, Sea Monster of Theseus w/ a Synchro 9, Legacy of the Duelist, Number 101 &amp; C101, ZEXAL, and a whole roster of Rank 4s to slot in instead like Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon! </em>  Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! It's a lot of fun to innovate on and revisit a modern classic like this in today's Trinity. I hope you have a fin-tastic time trying it out!"

You can also use any card effects (such as <a data-name=""Hand Destruction"">Hand Destruction</a> and <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a>) to discard <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> parts and send them directly to your GY allowing you to summon <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a>, it isn't optimal because you don't benefit from the effects activated when you send monsters from the field to the GY, but it helps if you're in a tight spot. Then it's just a matter of banishing everything your opponent tries to set or summon so you can keep summoning other <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> (by either discarding the parts with <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a>&nbsp;effect or summoning them on your field) and other link monsters such as <a data-name=""Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow"">Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow</a> or <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a> to attack your opponent directly, and also remember to use some of the traps to protect yourself and negate monster, spell and trap cards (if you didn't managed to ban all of them while they're face-down). (P.S.: I know some cards aren't really the best options for this kind of deck... but it's what I have available, so I'll have to work with that by now. I hope to keep updating this deck in the future with new cards)</p>"

I only placed 1 card for each to make room,Â <strong>below this I will have the recommended copy counts that you can get away with.</strong> But first, some ground rules for the list.  Actually, there is only one. To qualify, <strong>a card has to see major use across many different kinds of decks. </strong>With that said, it would be easy for any experienced player to list off, for example; all of the best Rank 4 XYZ monsters, or all of the best floodgates. So, I hope you understand that I couldn't include all of that!  Welp, below is the card copy count. I will have a rating from 1 to 3 for each card. 3 being for the most necessary staples and 1 for the least relevant.

They make a lot of summons per turn, so they can pretty easily make verte for Mirrorjade. I included the Brave/Adventure enginge because I could really, adds some extra power to the deck.  Combos:  The Tri-Brigade classic: Activate Fraktall, send Kitt, send Nervall, Search Keras, and either special it from hand, pr just hard summon. If special summoned, you can banish 4 for Shuraig, banish one, then either sit on it or link Keras with the Shuraig and make Bearbrumm for revolt, or Ferijit, then special a Lyrilusc and combo from there. If Keras is normal summoned, you can just make Ferijit and Lyrilusc combo from there.  Lyrilusc goodstuff: You have one Lyrilusc in hand and bird call. Add Turquoise Warbler, special it and the Lyrilusc in hand, for example, Cobalt Sparrow. Sparrow effect triggers, search Sapphire Swallow. Special Swallow from hand with a Nervall or something, then lyrilusc combo from there.  Common Questions: No Beryl Canary? I had quite a few issues with being bad at the game, and accidentally triggering it, and locking out Verte and Mirrorjade.  Judgement of the Branded? I put it in because you can send Albion, and end phase search Judgement. So you can banish one monster, end phase set judgement, then wipe the rest of their monsters next turn.  No mercourier? I couldn't be asked to read lmao, you could probably cut the Brave/Adventure engine and put it in + some handtraps.  Do your parents love you? I'm not playing mystic mine, so yes. <h4 class=""engine-dark-box""></h4>"

I just got into master duel and I decided I liked the Twins. from my minor understanding of the decks basic strategy. (definitely need some help and improvement) the strategy that I find doing the most is simple enough:  Normal summon one of the classic twins  then Special Summon her counter part  bring out one of the Evil twins based on the situation  use its quick effect to bring back the opposite (Evil twin Ki-sikil summons Lil-la and vice versa)  link out its opposite evil twin then revive the first link twin you summoned. you get to use its effect now because you control its counterpart.  this is a split here. you can either go into the Master duel twin boss monster if you have it in your hand or a way to search it.  or you can go into abomination.  &nbsp;  that is quite literally the extent of my knowledge for the main leading strategy. I know how to comeback sometimes but that is it. currently this deck has carried me to gold 2, I have not played past it because I am here to ask for potential improvements. I am here to ask for general card suggestions and information/ideas on other strategies.  &nbsp;  thank you for reading"

The deck does a good job in controlling and to setup powerful negates on the board, pretty str8 forward to use, evenly is for mirror matches against eldlich. I don't main Dramaturge, personally i prefer adlibitum (free fusion summon) but you can change them as you wish. Solemn is good going 1st maybe i'd side deck it for super poly or smt (personal preference) You can use kaiju's instead of nibiru (personal preference). When the new trap card will come in may its gonna be nuts."

Is the ""Mister No"" of pendulum decks, so the strategy is pretty simple: just negate what ever key-play your opponent gonna make.  To archive this goal the deck have 3 ways to say NO to whatever the opponent gonna play:  -With 15 hand traps (ofc): no need to explain those, right?  -the Counter traps: is the easiest way this deck gonna say NO to everything, other than the stable search at the summon of Zefraniu (<a data-name=""Nine pillars of yang zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a>/ <a data-name=""Zefra divine strike"">Zefra Divine Strike</a>), the 3x of <a data-name=""Guiding Ariadne"">Guiding Ariadne</a> allow you to goes +3 in combo with <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>: by activate his effect of destroying a card on your field to add a face up pendulum monster from your extra deck to your hand, trying to have always Ariadne as target in the pendulum zone, you gonna activate Ariadne searching effect, which will force your opponent to add to your hand one of the Counter Traps you have in your deck, + in late game the other copies of Ariadne let you activate the remaining Solemn Cards free from life point cost as the pendulum effect allow you to activate counter traps without any activation cost.  -Extra Deck monster: this gonna take little bit more to explain it since the deck have different way to brings powerful synchro,fusion and link omni negate monsters on the field, so let's see it one by one and how this deck is able to bring them on the field:  <span> <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></span>: Special summon from our pendulum zone by his own effect Abyss Actor-Curtain Raiser ( or <a data-name=""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"">Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm</a> by his own effect by sending it to the Graveyard with the 3x of <a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine </a>or Foolish burial), then normal summon <a data-name=""Performapal Skullcrobat Joker"">Performapal Skullcrobat Joker</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Performapal Skullcrobat Joker&quot;&gt;Performapal Skullcrobat Joker&lt;/a&gt;,"">,</a> with his effect we gonna search one of the two copies of <a data-name=""Harmonizing Magician"">Harmonizing Magician</a>and if we are able to pendulum summon it we gonna special summon with his effect from our deck <a data-name=""Dragonpulse Magician"">Dragonpulse Magician</a> , after that we gonna summon Electrumite using Skullcrobat and Curtain Raiser (or Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm) as link materials, on the first Electrumite effect at the summon we gonna send to extra deck face up <a data-name=""Chronograph Sorcerer"">Chronograph Sorcerer</a> or <a data-name=""Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver"">Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver </a>(doesn't matter which, wont change the combo we just need to have both in the hand), now we gonna use Harmonizing Magician and Dragonpulse as XYZ meterials to summonÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â <a data-name=""Timestar Magician"">Timestar Magician </a>and use his effect to add from our deck the remaining copy of Chronograph Sorcerer orÂ  Â  Â  Â  <a data-name=""Performapal Odd Eyes Dissolver"">Performapal Odd-Eyes Di</a><a data-name=""Performapal Odd Eyes Dissolver"">ssolver</a>Â to our hand; now we gonna activate the second effect of targeting and destroy (hopefully Aridane as target) of Electrumite on our field to add to our hand the extra deck copy of Chronograph Sorcerer or Performapal Odd Eyes Dissolver, at this point we will have Chronograph wand Dissolver in our hand and Chronograph will activate his self summon effect and gonna summon Dissolver from our hand, then we gonna use Dissolver fusion effect and use Chronograph as material and BOOM! Vortex is on the field ready to say NO to everything.  <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleaur"">Baronne De Fleaur</a> : So this is gonna be easier; we need to normal summon any monster on the field then special summon <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> from our hand or Graveyard (by using Dragon Shrine or Foolish burial) by paying half of our life point, use both monsters on the field to summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> ,with his effect we gonna summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> , now we gonna use both of our monsters to special summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a>, which will summon 3 level 3 machine wind token and will trigger the self summon effect from our graveyard of Deskbot001 allowing us to summon Baronne De Fleaur. We can also summon Baronne with <a data-name=""Zefraxi, the tresure of yang zing"">Zefraxi, the tresure of yang zing</a>'s effect that will turn in to a tuner another Zefra monster on the field (Zefraniu) allowing us to do a 6+4 summon with any lvl 4 monster we have on the field .  <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>: Just Harmonizing and Dragonpulse magician if you have an Odd Eyes Dissolver or Chronograph in you starting hand an you don't need to search one of them with <a data-name=""Timestar Magician"">Timestar Magician</a>.  <a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">F.A. Dawn Dragster</a>: Basically we just need Destrudo in our hand or GY and target a lvl 4 or 6 as target to be able to summon it.  <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of The Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of The Goddess</a><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of Godness:"">:</a> Is a pendulum deck, is really easy to have multiple monsters on the field but is more like a situational monster to summon.  Well those are the main combos of this deck, you can also remove some hand traps to bring in it an Endymion engine to have a little bit more main deck power if you like, well see ya!"

This is made for Master Duel. Shout outs to Steven, who thinks that Magic is better than Yu-Gi-Oh.  The appeal of Fur Hires is that they have monsters that can special summon other Fur Hires, and both activate special effects when they're summoned. This deck attempts to load a good amount of ""summoners"" while also having a few contingency plans in case you don't draw a summoner and a summonee. Fraktall can be cycled to get Rugal or Shuraig out, the Tri-Brigade spells and One for One can search out cards you need, and Card Destruction and Pot of Desires help to make your opening hand better.  The end state of the board is probably Shuraig and Rafale or Folgo. The Knightmares and Apollousa are there in case you need 'em, they're not completely necessary."

Is it very good, not really. Is it pretty fun, kinda. Is it funny to beat an opponent running","Ok, so the crux of this deck is understanding how to summon your big boss monsters. This is a going first deck but it also has things like Forbidden Droplet, Nibiru and Maxx C in order to be able to go second. Honestly depending on your hand you might be thankful that you went second instead of first.  For your link and XYZ monsters, Five Star Twilight and Multiply are your BEST friends.  In order for Five Star Twilight to function you need to tribute a 5 star monster, hence why Linkslayer and Red Hared Hasty Horse are in the deck. Both of their effects are ok but they are mostly for Five Star Twilight.  Weirdly, your strongest attacking main deck monster is Kuribabylon but its also not going to be super strong unless it's late game or after a bunch of link summoning after Five Star Twilight was activated.  Zeus + Downerd + Nightingale are in this deck mainly as a back up in case everything goes bad and you can only summon two level 1 monsters. If that is the case, just summon Nightingale, attack directly, summon Downerd and summon Zeus on top of that. That should be a two material Zeus that can clear the field twice."

Use to retrieve Mokey Mokey Smackdown.  Mokey Mokey Smackdown- Set up on the field when you're ready for the OTK.  Mokey Mokey King- Special summon with summoner of Illusions. Then crash the king to special summon the up to 5 Mokey Mokeys. If a special summon on the opponent's turn it will be destroyed no matter what and it will set up your field for your next turn.

Crash summoner if still on your field before Mokey Mokey King.  Honest- Hand trap. Can be pulled with Nova Summoner or Shining Angel, but make sure if you are on your opponent's turn that they have no more attacks. Then activate its effect and bring it to your hand.  Nova Summoner- Crash to Special Summon another copy, Shining Angel, Mokey Mokey, Marshmacaron, or Marshmallon. Do this to thin the deck. Also, this tactic is used as a defense wall.  Shining Angel- Crash to get Nova Summoner or Mokey Mokey. Marshmacaron, or Marshmallon. Do this to thin the deck. Also, this tactic is used as a defense wall.  Marsh monsters- Defensive wall.  Destruction cards- toss away Mokey Mokeys.  Supply Squad- Usefully draw cards due to how this deck wants to crash its monsters.  Pot of Duality/Sales Pitch- Draw a card that helps with various situations.  Spirit Barrier- Let's use crash with no downside. Also a good defensive wall.

The amount of plays are as endless as the amount of times you will misplay the deck which in my opinion is all the reason I love it. This is the first deck where the more I played the more I wanted to play it just so I could perfect my plays with it. There is something about playing a deck that has so many options that is just so enticing, then piecing together strategies to ultimately make your opponent succumb to your enormous brain is just the CrÃ¨me de la CrÃ¨me.  Enjoy the deck and the video!"

I play mine like 3 cards differently than him. I took this to being a TCG deck only, and being able to turbo out some of the greatest heckin fusion monsters Konami has introduced to us and let certain decks abuse, well actually all decks because Verte. The beauty of this deck, there is no need....you know what, I'll let you guys read below.  <strong>""Why play this deck?"", you may ask yourself:</strong>  â¢ It can turbo outÂ <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>Â without Verte or REF. Do I need to say more? â¢ It can make DPE without Verte. Do I need to say even more? â¢ It abusesÂ <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. â¢ It can survive without the Brave Token engine.  Here's the list and some strats:  <strong>The Main Deck:</strong>  Monsters <ul>  	<li><strong>The Despians (<a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>,Â <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a>,Â <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a>,Â <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a>, &amp;Â <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Comedy</a>)</strong>Â - Can't play the deck without them. Stuff they do:</li> </ul> <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li>Dramaturge - Main deck boss monster. Can recycle himself when sent to GY or is banished as Fusion material. Has a targeting negation effect when an Extra Deck monster is special summoned (not just from the Extra Deck). You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky.</li>  	<li>Ad Libitum - One of the reasons you can grind and recycle. This can bring back a banishedÂ <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>Â orÂ <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>Â or in your GY upon getting sent to the GY or is banished as Fusion material. Also has an ok ATK boosting effect that can be relevant occasionally. You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky. You can recycle him with your Albaz Fusions anyway.</li>  	<li>Aluber - He's your main Normal Summon in the deck and THE REASON WHY YOU DO NOT PLAY THE GODDAMN BRAVE TOKENS IN THIS DECK BECAUSE IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO HIM. He also has a targeting negation effect in the GY when a Fusion monster you control is either destroyed by battle or leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect. I only play 2 because I already know how the deck plays but you can most certainly play 3 by cutting anything but the 1 ofs, except forÂ <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a>Â &amp;Â <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>.</li>  	<li>Tragedy - Playing 3 of this enables you to play draw cards like Allure of Darkness. I do not understand why people only play 1 of this considering how this is your main searcher. I don't recommend cutting this.</li>  	<li>Comedy - Utility 1 of. Archetypal hand trap to protect your Despia monsters from targeting effects, also allows your Fusion monsters to dodge your opponent's targeting effects while it's in the GY. Feel free to cut this.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></strong> - Your other relevant Normal Summon in the game. Super Polymerization on legs but can be responded. Regardless, weaker Super Poly is still Super Poly. You can set this against Dragon decks and contact fuse for a lot of the dragon targets in the extra deck. Hell, it can become a free Tyrant Dragon if playing against a Blue Eyes deck.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a></strong>Â - Can special summon herself. Brings out Fallen of Albaz from the Deck. Also a LIGHT target forÂ <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>Â +Â <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a></strong>Â - The main reason why you can bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon faster than Verte turbo decks. Also a greatÂ <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a>Â bait.</li>  	<li><strong>The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion - </strong>It is a light target for any other play while in the graveyard, and then helps cheat out Tyrant Dragon to give a 3400 beat stick that can take out almost anything and can recycle some of the traps in the graveyard</li>  	<li><strong>Artifact Scythe -Â </strong>Scythe lock when you have First Darklord on the field, and it's funny to watch your opponent squirm not being able to touch their extra deck, lmao</li>  	<li><strong>Jizukiru -Â </strong>Just a kaiju to help out some monsters that can't be targeted for destruction, or effects, which also gives a light target on your opponent's field for any of the super poly plays with the boy Albaz</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Spells <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></strong>Â - Banishing DARK monsters face-up is not a problem, your Fusion monsters can recycle them anyway. Also pair this withÂ <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a>Â for a +1.</p> <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></strong>Â - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.</p> <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong>Â - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.</p> <p><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - You're almost always dumping Tragedy</p> <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a></strong>Â - The reason why I prefer playing less copies of Aluber, because I can summon him off of this anyway. Also, if you pitch Tragedy with its effect, or if you play a Branded Shaddolls variant, you can chain block Aluber from gettingÂ <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>ed.</p> <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>Â - You literally have no reason to not play this card. All of your Fusion monsters are Super Poly targets.</p> <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong>Â - Your main search target for Aluber. One of the three reasons why you can summonÂ <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>Â in this deck, and also the main reason why it is so worth it to play in this deck, because it can bring him or any Level 8 or higher Fusion monster back from the GY when a non-Fusion Fairy monster you control is either destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent's card effect. Feel free to cut it to 1, but it's always good to have insurance in case it gets banished.</p> Traps <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Banishment -Â </a></strong><a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Recycles any Despia or lvl 8 or higher fusion monsters in the grave, which then leads to you being able to have another super poly effect, non-target banishment</a></p> <p><strong>â¢Â <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Retribution</a></strong>Â - SearchableÂ <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>Â that can also be used to recycle your Branded Spells/Traps by banishing itself. Feel free to bump it up to 3 or cut it down to 1 if you prefer.</p> <strong>The Extra Deck:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong>Â - Honorary boss monster. Gives all your Fairies effect targeting protection, can also bring any Fairy monster in your GY OPT. A cute interaction you can do is summon him usingÂ <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">as much of your Despians</a> as Fusion Material and Special Summon Scythe during your opponent's Main Phase and lock them from the extra deck</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Despian Proskenion</a></strong>Â - Despia boss monster, supposedly. Has a neat effect of either stealing or banishing an opponent's Extra Deck monster in the GY, also burns your opponent equal to the original ATK or DEF of a monster it destroys by battle, whichever was higher. Great Super Poly target.</li>  	<li>Â <strong>Despian Quaeritis -Â </strong>Fun Despian fusion that drops attack points of non-Lvl 8 or higher fusion monsters, and can stall a battle phase or help you deal damage.</li>  	<li><strong>Â <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong>Â - This deck has absolutely NO REASON not to play Dragoon in this deck. It's a Towers boss monster that you can bring out without using Verte Anaconda or Red-Eyes Fusion, which are both the problematic parts of summoning him, has the same omni negate the racist tokens provide, except it's also a Level 8 Fusion monster that has FULL SYNERGY WITH YOUR DECK, UNLIKE THEM EXPENSIVE ASS TOKEN ENGINE, can opt pop a monster your opponent controls and burn it, and can be brought back with eitherÂ <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad LibitumÂ </a>orÂ <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Theater</a>. This is the main reason why I am compelled to make this list even when I've already made like five or more iterations of this deck, all of which have Dragoon and I have tested against post-DIFO decks and survived well enough.</li>  	<li><strong>The Branded Dragons (<a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade</a>,Â <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion</a>, <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade</a>,Â <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad</a>, Alba-Lentus &amp; <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion</a>)</strong>Â - The stars of the show, all Super Poly targets with the following effects:</li> </ul> <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li>Mirrorjade - Your most forgiving Super Poly target. Can once per every other turn, banish a monster on the field without targeting at a cost of sending a Fusion monster that lists ""Fallen of Albaz"" in its text from your Extra Deck to the GY. Also destroys all monsters your opponent controls during the End Phase of the turn it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Lubellion - One of the main reasons this deck can recycle. It Fusion Summons at a cost of a discard by shuffling the materials of that Fusion monster from your GY or banished to the deck. The second reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck.</li>  	<li>Masquerade - The bane of combo decks. Makes your opponent pay taxes in LP for each time they attempt to activate a card or effect. This effect is not a once per copy, so having two of him stacks, bumping it up from 600 to 1200 LP per card or effect activation.</li>  	<li>Titaniklad - Your main fodder for Mirrorjade, except this time, you won't be searching for a Dogmatika monster, but Special Summoning Fallen of Albaz instead as an interruption.</li>  	<li>Albion - Ideally you'll be summoning him first before Lubellion, but he's the third reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck. It Fusion Summons without a cost by banishing the materials of that Fusion monster from your hand, field, and/or GY. It also sets you a Branded Spell/Trap from your Deck if it is sent to the GY this turn, ideally eitherÂ <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a>Â for additional interruption orÂ <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a>Â for protection.</li>  	<li>Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon - Punish any Dragon deck, Fuse using Albaz's effect OR, contact fusion using both fields for summoning. The second it touches the graveyard, you can search for any normal ""Fusion"" or ""Polymerization"" card, guess what that is, ding ding ding free DPE</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <ul>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon</a>Â &amp;Â <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a></strong> - Generic Super Poly targets, one of which has a pretty relevant interruption/floodgate effect, another that can use monsters on either field to negate effects with a predator counter on it.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Eyes Tyrant Dragon -Â </strong>Hex-Sealed target for 3400 beat stick monster that can attack all monsters your opponent controls, and can reset any trap in your graveyard</li> </ul> <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>  #1. Don't play it with them Brave Tokens. Not because you can, doesn't mean you should. #2. This deck needs LIGHT targets, not overpriced engine that does nothing more for the deck. You'd be much better off running Kaijus instead. Speaking of which, if you want a free omni negate but also want a LIGHT target, just play Invoked in this deck, simple. #3. If your deck can abuse Super Poly, there's no reason not to do it while it's still at 3. #4. If your deck can abuse BOTH Dragoon and DPE, there's no reason not to do it while they're still both legal in the TCG  Overall, because there are some powerful monsters that can handle so many negates and play through so many damn effects and deal with some larger plays people may throw at you. Since people hate Verte, they hate fusions because of the free fusion summon. Again, thanks to Grayewick for the inspiration and his original list, I tweaked and played it differently, with my side deck being more intuned with copying him exactly."

You want to go second and hopefully you've drawn a Kaiju to remove the opponent's boss monster. Then you can use your Danger! beasts to remove cards or summon for XYZ into an OTK. Gren Maju and Gizmek is in the deck for easy summoning, but also gives you a strong normal monster when your opponent doesn't allow special summoning or their boss monster isn't affected by card effects. Normally you'll only ever use Number 38, 97, and 100 from the extra deck. Use Number 97 to setup an OTK with Number 100 once you've cleared the board or go into Number 38 for defense after your Battle Phase."

Personally I play saffira because you tribute a monster to get it out, so if a hieratic is tributed you can summon labradorite dragon and either summon ultimaya or king of atum. Saffira also has the effect if a light monster (all hieratics are light) was tributed for it's ritual summon, during the end phase you can either, draw 2 cards and discard 1, discard one random card from your opponents hand, or add 1 light monster from your gy to your hand. The ritual spell also helps you protect saffira, if it would be destroyed by a battle or card effect, you can banish it instead. To get both saffira and the ritual spell in your hand you can use pre-preparation of rites, to add 1 ritual spell from the deck, then add 1 ritual monster from the deck or gy which name is listed on the ritual spell. Dragard can summon a normal monster from the gy when normal summon, then you can tribute any dragon-type, then target one card on the field and make it's level 8, so if you summon hieratic seal of the sun dragon overload with it's effect, then tribute a hieratic monster and make itself level 8 and get labradorite dragon on the field because you tributed, now you can xyz summon a rank 8 with dragard and sun dragon overload. Artillary catapult turtle can tribute any monster one the field to summon a level 5 dragon from hand or deck. If a hieratic is tributed you both get hieratic dragon of eset and a normal monster of your choice on the field. Hieratic dragon of eset has the effect that your can target a face-up dragon-type normal monster and make all your hieatic monsters the same level as the normal monster, so after you get both your eset and your level 6 or 8 normal monster on the field with the effect of artillary catapult turtle, you can use esets effect so you either have 2 level 6 or 8 monsters on the field. Piercing the darkness lets you draw a card once per turn when you summon a normal monster, since it's a continuous spell and you more or less summon a normal monster every turn, your can draw 2 cards every turn. Celestial observatory let you return a level 6 monster to the button of the deck to draw 2 cards, so you send saffira (which is a level 6) if it's in your hand without the ritual spell, or if you have 2 Tefnuit in the hand since you only can use it's effect once per turn.</p>"

Oh no she has airpods in. Oh god oh fu-","(This used to be a deck breakdown of my Master Duel Lyrilusc deck, but that version sucks so bad with how few UR points I spent on it. Hereâs my TCG version instead which is better than that bricky mess of a deck)  Lyrilusc is a solid xyz-focused deck that unfortunately had to take a hit for Tri-Brigadeâs sins. The deck isnât dead yet though and can still put up some impressive endboards when played pure. Just be warned that running Tri-Brigades in this deck instead of playing the pure version does make the deck more resilient overall. I just personally love playing decks as pure as I can.  <strong>Deck Breakdown:</strong>  Main Deck Monsters: <ol>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Turquoise Warbler"">Lyrilusc - Turquoise Warbler</a>: The best starter in the deck. Summons straight from hand on an empty field, and if it's special summoned from hand you can special another Lyrilusc from hand or grave for free. Always run three.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow"">Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow</a>: The best extender in the deck. Summons from hand if you control a winged-beast, and then summons another level 1 winged-beast from hand. As a bonus, it evens grabs an extra material from grave if you use it to summon a Wind xyz. Run three of this as well</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Beryl Canary"">Lyrilusc - Beryl Canary</a>: The second-best extender in the deck. It summons itself from hand and grabs another Lyrilusc from grave as well for the low price of being locked into xyz monsters for the rest of the turn. Really sucks in some other builds that focus on links, but for an xyz focused build it's extremely useful for extending combos. Run three unless you really wanna use links.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow"">Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow</a>: On special summon, it searches any level 1 winged-beast. If you didn't notice, that's the entire archetype's main deck monster lineup. By far your best special summon off Sapphire Swallow, and one of their spell cards. And it protects any Wind xyz summoned with it from being targeted. Its search effect is a hard OPT but running three doesnât hurt the deck at all.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Celeste Wagtail"">Lyrilusc - Celeste Wagtail</a>: This one searches the other half of your archetype's main deck cards. On special summon, it grabs a Lyrilusc spell/trap from deck. The spell/trap lineup of this deck is busted as hell, so finding one for free during a combo is extremely useful. It also attaches itself from GY for free to any Lyrilusc xyz on board. Run two since itâs also a hard OPT and itâs not as flexible as Cobalt Sparrow.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Slower Swallow"">Slower Swallow</a>: The only non-Lyrilusc involved in the combos. Summons from hand for free if 2 or more monsters with the same level are on field. That includes your opponent's field if they ever happen to make that kind of gamestate. And it can even tribute itself to double your draw next turn. You can get two or three searches of level 1 winged-beasts during the combo so you really only need one, but running two or three really wouldn't hurt the deck at all.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a>: By discarding this card and another wind monster you can search any of the monsters listed above. Just an all-around amazing card in this deck and you should run three no matter what build you play. Just be mindful of the discard cost as it can sometimes be a brick.</li>  	<li>Handtraps: Anywhere between 6 and 12 works well in the deck without killing consistency. I use <a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Springs"">Ash Blossom and Joyous Springs</a> since itâs the more generically useful handtrap in the game as well as <a data-name=""Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion</a> since itâs super effective against all the decks of the people I play with. Thereâs also Infinite Impermanence but weâll get into that card later.</li> </ol> Main Deck Spells/Traps: <ol>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Bird Call"">Lyrilusc - Bird Call</a>: This deck gets an archetypal search card that can also be a foolish burial, and it even summons one Lyrilusc from hand when it resolves. I don't know this got through the R&amp;D department at Konami but this card is busted. Run three until they limit/ban it.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Bird Sanctuary"">Lyrilusc - Bird Sanctuary</a>: The archetype's second-best spell/trap. If you control an xyz monster, you get a free draw. And if you control two xyz monsters, you can attach one to the other to make a huge xyz monster. Run one because it's searchable.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc â Bird Strike"">Lyrilusc â Bird Strike</a>: A searchable archetypal Dark Ruler No More. And it doesnât even have the drawback of not being able to damage the opponent. Just a crazy card. Run one since itâs searchable, but I run the other two in the side deck since you sometimes canât search it through negation depending on your matchup.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Wonders of Nature"">Wonders of Nature</a>: This card is just insanely good in this deck. If you open it and any of the Lyriluscâs with effects that activate on special summon, you can use this to proc those effects and then search a Poly in the end phase. I always run three since it has basically zero drawbacks., but if you play TCG or Master Duel you can run <a data-name=""Summon Storm"">Summon Storm</a> instead in this slot.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>: Summons a level 1 straight from deck. Just make sure you're only summoning Celeste Wagtail or Cobalt Sparrow with this since the others won't get their effects. Run one because it's limited and probably always will be.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Wing Requital"">Wing Requital</a>: Pot of greed for a 600 LP cost if you control 2 or more winged beasts. You're gonna control a lot of winged-beasts. Run three because going +1 is super cool. Just be aware itâs not always online past turn one with how many non-winged-beast options you tend to end on.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>: Honestly, you probably shouldn't run Poly at all in this deck. Beryl Canary locks you into xyz monsters the turn you activate its effect, so most of the time this is a dead draw. However, I think Independent Nightingale is a cool card and I love summoning it. If you don't share that opinion, there are plenty of better cards to run instead that we'll get into later.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>: Not as great as <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> for dealing with handtraps, but Crossout has a bit much of a deck cost for me to run it. Run one because you canât run any more than that, but if you donât mind losing deck space to Crossout targets, run three of that instead.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>: Unironically my favorite handtrap in the game and I run a playset in every deck that I can. Itâs like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> on steroids. You can swap this out for another handtrap though.</li> </ol> Extra Deck: <ol>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Recital Starling"">Lyrilusc - Recital Starling</a>: Searches any level 1 winged-beast by detaching a material. This is only a soft OPT, so every Recital Starling you summon can use this search effect if you can somehow manage to summon this more than once in a turn. It also has an attack increasing effect that has never come up ever. Run one because itâs limited, but bump this up to two or three if it ever comes off the list. If you play OCG or Master Duel, run two or three instead.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale"">Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</a>: The old win condition of the deck. If you stack a bunch of materials on her, she can attack once for each material, and gains 200 attack for each material, AND can attack directly. This card can OTK with 7 materials and can become a huge Zeus with any less. It can also provide destruction and battle protection to your whole archetype while also preventing battle damage. Run one or two since you only need that many to win a game</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin"">Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin</a>: The archetype's new ""win condition"". Can bounce any monster special summoned by your opponent without an OPT on the card. This deck also excels at making huge xyz monsters, so you might be able to completely stop your opponent for a turn. Run one or two since you tend to kill your opponent before a third one would even be needed.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Promenade Thrush"">Lyrilusc - Promenade Thrush</a>: The weakest of all the Lyrilusc xyz monsters, but it still has some utility. It can clear one spell/trap by bouncing it and can increase the attack of one of your monsters to help close out a game. By detaching just two materials from this card, you can buff up a 5 material Assembled Nightingale to be in OTK range. Run one because it doesnât come up all the time, but when it does, youâre about to win the game.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale"">Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale</a>: The fusion boss monster of an xyz deck without any archetypal fusion spell. This card is so bad in its own archetype, but I love it so much and just have toplay it here. This card is prime kaiju bait though and might cost you a game instead of winning it. It could also be used as an Instant Fusion target if you want to run that card. Just be mindful of its limited status. Run one at most.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Downerd Magician"">Downerd Magician</a>: Acts as a bridge between your xyz monsters and Zeus for an extra material. Run one because you only need one Zeus.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a>: The best generic xyz monster in the game. Can get some insane numbers of materials after you perform your full combo. Run one because you only need one to close out a game.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: The best way to set up your GY in this deck. It also has a super handy battle phase effect that can save your ass in a pinch. Run one because it self-recurs and only really needs to be summoned once.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: Just to link off a Nibiru token if you get hit with the rock. Run one because if you're getting Nibiru-ed twice in one game, you already lost it.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant"">Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant</a>: Not super necessary, but can help against other wind decks by grabbing one of their monsters from grave or even searching one of your monsters after it dies. Run one because it barely ever comes up.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a>: A great generic link that can give you your opponentâs boss monster with just three monsters as an investment. It doesnât come up in every game, and it conflicts with Wynn and Beryl Canary, but if you manage to resolve its effect you can win a game on the spot. Run one because you only need one to turn the game around.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>: Iâm sure everyoneâs seen this card before. If youâre like me and want to summon Independent Nightingale, run this card as a way to avoid needing Poly searchers in an xyz deck. If youâre in the OCG or just want to avoid that card entirely, you can drop this for a different card. Just run one Verte since we arenât using Prosperity or Extrav in the deck.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: Another good turn 1 option. If you summon this before Beryl Canary, you can have 3-4 monster negates basically for free. Run one because you only ever need one.</li> </ol> Side Deck: <ol>  	<li>Other Handtraps: I personally run three <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a> and three <a data-name=""Droll and Lock Bird"">Droll and Lock Bird</a> in my side deck, but you can run whichever handtraps work the best for you.</li>  	<li>Kaijus: Your best options in this deck are <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, and <a data-name=""Gadarla the Mystery Dust Kaiju"">Gadarla the Mystery Dust Kaiju</a>. You rarely ever normal summon so Sphere Mode and Lava Golem donât conflict with the deck all that much, and Gadarla is the best Kaiju for this deck since itâs a wind-attribute card. Wynn needs more winds after all, so itâs decent discard fodder if you draw it turn one.</li>  	<li>Anti-Backrow Cards: Every deck needs at least three of these in the side deck to be able to combat backrow heavy decks. I play a <a data-name=""Harpieâs Feather Duster"">Harpieâs Feather Duster</a> and three <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> in my side decks since the Duster can clear all the backrow at once and Cyclone banishes instead of destroying.</li> </ol> Other Options: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Performapal Trump Witch"">Performapal Trump Witch</a>: If you really want to go deep on the Independent Nightingale route, you can use Trump Witch as extra copies of Poly that can also fusion summon while set in scales. If you don't ever want to fusion summon though, just ignore this one.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Jester Confit"">Jester Confit</a>: This card is the best level 1 extender in the game. I just personally don't like looking at him. He's also a dark-type spellcaster so he's completely unsearchable in the deck and can clash with Wynn. He's not a bad choice for the deck at all though</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> and <a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>: The best instant fusion targets for this deck. Both can yoink a monster and then be used to extend link or xyz plays.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"">Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</a>: This deck summons a lot of xyz monsters per turn, and none of them are Numbers, so you can make UDF super easily to add some negation to your end board. This package does require two extra deck slots to work, and for those with a keen eye, you might have noticed two extra deck cards that sorta work together in Independent Nightingale and Verte Anaconda. Theyâre the best two cards you can swap out for this package.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Kikinagashi Fucho"">Kikinagashi Fucho</a>: Not that great of a card, but if you brick badly enough summoning this can keep you alive for another turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen</a>: Non-targeting banish on summon and when another tri-type is summoned to your field. Really good when you're going second, but not as free as he is in a dedicated Tri-Brigade build.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a>: One of the best generic links in the game, and with how easy this deck can spam the board, you can summon it decently consistently. If youâre in the OCG and still want to run Independent Nightingale, replace Verte with this card.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Where Arf Thou?"">Where Arf Thou?</a>: Another search card to add consistency to the deck. It's a bit wonkier to use though since you can't search until you have a level 1 on board (thanks Exodia...) so I never really run it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>: Just a way to get another level 1 on board for xyz spamming. I use Ready Fusion in all my decks that could run both, but the level 1 pool of fusion monsters doesnât have any non-effect monsters.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a>: Acts like a Skill Drain for one turn. Just a bit of an eh include with it being a trap in a very fast deck.</li> </ul> All in all, I really love this deck and I think it's a great option as a potential rogue deck. Just be warned that this exact version is a bit pricey with the cards I included. Swapping out the handtrap lineup I chose for a cheaper one and tweaking the extra deck by removing the Verte, Apollousa, and Zeus package can make this an extremely affordable deck to play without too much of a hit to how well the deck can perform. Just be warned that Bird Call is like 3 dollars a copy."

(Not meta FYI, but it is pretty consistent.)","The go to play is an FTK. Use various Tactics to get a low scale Abyss Actor into one scale, and Abyss Actor - Twinkle Little Star into your other scale. Then fusion summon Despian Quaeritis and change everyone's ATK to 0. Next Pendulum Summon Abyss Actor - Evil heel, And use Twinkle Little Stars effect so Evil Heel can attack 3 times. If your opponent has 3 or more monsters, the take 9000 damage resulting in defeat. The big problem with this deck is so far it doesn't have much of a backup plan other than use Evilswarm Exciton Knight/ Zeus to send everything to the GY if you can't FTK, and it has little backrow removal.  One other thing it can do though, You Won't always draw a hand that lets you fusion summon. So I added Artifact Scythe. If Abyss Playhouse and a pendulum summoned Abyss Actor are on the field, you can change one of your opponents monster effects into ""destroy 1 set spell/trap your opponent controls."", making them waste an effect to destroy Scythe, also locking them out of their extra deck.  Any feedback is appreciated, and have fun!"

And for everyone, Sand Stone is to be sent to graveyard and used on first turn with Fossil Fusion to summon Fossil Warrior Skull Knight first turn, then with Time Stream summon Fossil Warrior Skull King. Adamancipators make this deck a little bit faster, and with Halqifibrax you can get to Formula Synchron and get a free draw and access to Baronne since if you got to 1 Adamancipator, you will alredy have Dragite on the field."

Theater Kids and Waifus, pretty much just an anime deck.","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with another Fusion list (surprise, surprise), Branded Dragonmaids.</span>  <span><strong>""B-but Grayewick, Dragonmaids have a lot of irrelevant Attributes, didn't you tell people to not play engines with irrelevant Attributes with Branded? Reeeee!!!""</strong></span>  <span>Yes, Dragonmaids do have non-LIGHT and non-DARK monsters, but you're forgetting the most important part. They're all Dragon-types. Not only is Albaz a heavy counter against Dragon-type centered decks, but he also is a Dragon and is also synergistic with them. There's always room for reasonable exceptions.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>Well it's simple, really. Branded is a Fusion heavy deck, and Dragonmaids at its core is also a Fusion deck, technically speaking, so... yeah. Oh, also Dragonmaid Sheou and House Dragonmaid are LIGHT Fusions, so it's really good for the reasons that I'll discuss later further on the list. I'm honestly tempted to make a Dragonmaid Shaddolls list now that I think about it but anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span>Before everything else, at this point I gotta explain first that my ratios for a standard splashable Branded engine for all of my lists, unless exceptions have to be made which I would most definitely state, are going to be:</span> <span>â¢ x2 <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia</a>, <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a> for the monsters.</span> <span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> with/without x1 <a data-name=""Branded In Red"">Branded In Red</a> for the Spells, depending on whether you want to use <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> or not.</span> <span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> with/without x2 <a data-name=""Branded Retribution"">Branded Retribution</a> for the Traps.</span>  <span>If you wanna know what they do, just hover over their names and take a short read, so after this all I'm going to be explaining are only my non-Branded card ratios.</span>  <span>â¢ The Dragon waifus (<a data-name=""Dragonmaid Lorpar"">Dragonmaid Lorpar</a>, <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Ernus"">Dragonmaid Ernus</a>, <a data-name=""Chamber Dragonmaid"">Chamber Dragonmaid</a>, <a data-name=""Kitchen Dragonmaid"">Kitchen Dragonmaid</a>, <a data-name=""Parlor Dragonmaid"">Parlor Dragonmaid</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Nurse Dragonmaid"">Nurse Dragonmaid</a>) - <span>The other half of this strategy. Their effects are, if you're not aware:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Lorpar - <span>It's an Infinite Impermanence at a cost of just discarding itself. It also has an on-field card destruction protection while you control ANY Fusion monster.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Ernus - <span>Has a Quick Effect to Special Summon any Level 4 or lower Dragonmaid monster from your hand. Shares the same protection as Lorpar, as per every Dragonmaids' Dragon forms.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Chamber - <span>Searches any Dragonmaid Spell/Trap, most likely either <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Changeover"">Changeover</a> or <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Tidying"">Tidying</a>.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Kitchen - <span>Searches any Dragonmaid monster, but also makes you discard a Dragonmaid monster. Just a one of because of her Attribute.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Parlor - <span>Sends any Dragonmaid card from your Deck to the GY. Just a one of for the same reasons as Kitchen's.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Nurse - <span>Special Summons a Level 4 or lower Dragonmaid monster in your GY, except a copy herself although it targets so, bummer. Also just a one of for obvious reasons.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Changeover"">Dragonmaid Changeover</a></strong> - <span>A searchable Fusion Spell is always great, I'm actually considering bumping this up to two, just for insurance against banishing effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Hospitality"">Dragonmaid Hospitality</a></strong> - <span>Allows you to not only Special Summon a Dragonmaid monster from your hand, saving your Normal Summon, but also lets you send another Dragonmaid monster from your Deck to the GY for set up.</span></span>  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Tidying"">Dragonmaid Tidying</a></strong> - <span>A searchable targeting but non-destruction removal, albeit a bit slow. It also gives you recovery for the grind games.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Downtime"">Dragonmaid Downtime</a></strong> - <span>A searchable half-search card and half-Spell/Trap ""removal"". It's a Continuous Trap, so be mindful when using it.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ x2 <a data-name=""Dragonmaid Sheou"">Dragonmaid Sheou</a> &amp; <a data-name=""House Dragonmaid"">House Dragonmaid</a></strong> - <span>Your Dragonmaid boss monsters. If I had two more Extra Deck slots, I would definitely play one more copy of each of them.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong> - <span>Staple for Branded at this point, also because of <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>, since he doesn't negate their effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a></strong> - <span>Because I'm also playing <a data-name=""Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> - <span>Understandable. I'm not debating with this one.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>Honestly, I don't really have anything much else to say but, this deck works, possibly even better than I expected before testing. Also, the The First Darklord + Artifact Scythe interaction, I just realized it while making this list because I forgot for a second that Scythe was an Artifact card, and so is Artifact Lancea, so if I can do it with Lancea, surely I could also do it with Scythe, and I was right. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

What can go wrong?,"The deck works really simple, it focuses a lot on bringing different negates throughout different stages of the combo, providing several immunity against hand traps/interruptions in general throughout completing the combo. The deck was inspired from Triff Gaming, but updated it to fit Master Duel rules and to fit the ocg rules. note this is a common miss consiption: Pend cards are considered spell cards meaning that it can be negated by an effect of a imperial order.  Your aim is to summon Endymion, Jackal king, apollousa/I:P and Odd-eyes vortex dragon. Each card function: Cerebrus: usually to bait an ash while searching for jackal king, it makes sure your opponent to waste it or waste a negate. Otherwise, its a free special if you can pull jackal king and activate its effect of summoning cerebrus. This provides another sort of bait, in case you have 4 spell counters on the field, you can activate cerebrus effect to banish a monster that provides a threat for you, which of course reduces the amount of negates your opponent have in case going second. Endymion the mighty master: This is pretty much one of your boss monsters, its great going first or going second especially with this build. For going first, usually you want to keep this card in your hand so you can discard it or pend summon it. but if you're stuck and you need 1 spell counter, usually you can place this card in your pend zone if you have a free slot. otherwise its bricky, that's why you want to discard it in the gy or extra deck. if its in the gy, you can bring it out with selene later one, if its in the extra deck you can Pend summon. Going second this card is really good to board wipe your opponent especially if you have left over spell counters. having 6 of them on the field you can destroy a lot of your opponent cards, and it can't be negated by skill drain, since its considered a spell card while bringing it out using this effect, meaning that it can't be negated using monster negates. Astrograph: good card to search for cards in your extra deck if you search it using electrumite, or if you have it in your hand. Plus its a free summon (and a great lvl 7 card to bring out Odd-eyes absolute dragon). Empress endymion: good card to collect spell counters, and a great card for low scale pend. Besides it's a great card to remove cards without destroying them (but it still targets them) this card is really situational, but overall really good. Since as a cost to remove a card by returning it to hand, you have to remove a card with a spell counter from your field. Which gives you another card to set in your pend scale or to collect more spell counters. Jackal King: A really good monster negate, which blocks nibirus and ash blossom while its on the field. It's not a hard once per turn, meaning if you activated one during your main phase, and then summoned it another time, you can activate its affect one more time. Having multiples of this card in your field is very welcoming. Chronograph Sorcerer: A really good card to summon monsters from your hand, or to collect spell counters. In the pend zone its a high scale that allows you to summon a decent amount of your monsters, while also it allows you to bring out Time Gazer, which either helps you add one more spell counter or a free summon to get into heavy metal foes or starving venom. it works in a similar way to astrograph with its summoning mechanic, also its special summon effect is not a once per turn, meaning you can keep on summoning it multiple times. Magical Abductor: A really really good card, it keeps on collecting spell counters, searches for your cards, low scale pend zone card, and provides a free destruction for electrumite. Unlike most endymion cards, once you activate magical abductor effect it won't be removed from the pend zone, meaning that you can keep ons tacking spell counters, or destroy it using electrumite. Sky Striker Raye: A good card and engine for this deck thanks to the amount of special summons it provide. the reason this card is used because of hornets. Since hornet is not a once per turn, which allows you to use it twice, giving you more spell counters, or a recovery in case of your board being wiped. Magister of Endymion: High pend scale, and great to take monsters from your extra deck. It uses spell counters and can provide you with an endymion from your extra deck, which helps in going into your combos overall, or a free negate. Servant of Endymion: This card is one of the best cards in this deck due to how useful it is. It allows you to search and summon a monster from your deck, similar to Magister of Endymion. At the same time its usually your go to whenever you want to search for magical abductor (usually, not all the time). It also helps in giving your endymion a free negate and a spell counter on him, making him untargettable by card effects. Spellbook magician: A good monster to search for more spells to stack spell counters/draw cards. Note he has to be normal/flip summoned to activate his affect, pend summoning him is useless, and usually he's the target of your special summons. Mythical beast Jackal: a good combo starter if you don't have big monsters, it allows you to remove 3 spell cards from your field, tribute it, and special summon a pend monster from your deck. Magician's soul: A really good card to draw more cards, free summon for your link summons, and most importantly a great card to sending your endymion/astrograph to the gy, so it can be summoned using Selene later on. SpellBook of knowledge: A good draw 2 card, and good for sending monsters to the gy. Note that if you activate this card to send a pend spellcaster to the gy, it will send it to the extra deck, meaning that you won't get to draw the 2 cards. so you have to use this card on an effect monster that's not pend to get use of its draw 2. Pot of desires: a good draw 2 card, adding more spell counters to your field too. Spell Power Control: a good card to add a lot of spell counters to your field, and helps in searching for monsters based on the situation you're in. Engage!: helps in starting your sky striker combo (usually you want to search for hornet using this card), and its a great card going first/second and you have no monsters in your main zone. this card comes in action when you link summon and you want to extend your combo. Where you use Engage! search Hornet, use hornet. go into kagari, take hornet, and use hornet again to go into zeke. Or keep them so you can go into a selene once you have a spellcaster on the field. Note that this is perfect if you have Abductor/Servant in your pend zones to stack free 3 spell counters. The rest of the cards are pretty much fillers and situational draws/negates/sending cards to the gy. Magical citadel is a great card overall, but it's important to know when to use it. Usually you want to activate this card after activating Servant/Abductor, and you are sure that you can activate 2 other spell cards after it to activate Servant/Abductor. Activating it first occurs when you don't have enough spell cards to activate Servant/Abductor, so you activate it first try to get 3 spell counters to activate servant/abductors effect. Extra deck monsters: Starving Venom: Usually you want to copy the effect of Electrumite to get another card draw and a destruction of your pend cards so you can activate chronograph/astrograph again. Plus its a free monster for your link summon if you bring I:P. Vortex dragon: Generally a good recycle type of negate, you want to bring this card out using the effect of Absolute dragon. Absolute dragon: Usually you want to summon this card, then link summon/destroy using your Electrumite to bring out vortex dragon. all you need to do basically is send this card to the gy to activate its affect. Accesscode Talker/Knightmare Phoenix/Unicorn/Apollousa: Your I:p summon target based on the type of situation you're in. Accesscode is your going second solution for a beatstick destruction, Knightmare for interrupting a combo. Apollousa is your target against monsters affects. Selene: A core card that helps you get a load of free spell counters, summon monsters from your gy, and allows you to pend summon a lot of monsters to your side of the field without worrying much, since you can pend into up to 3 cards from your extra deck based on her free link zones. Electrumite: Its effect is really clear especially with how many times it have been mentioned on the list, meaning its combo piece is pretty much simple, you summon it add chronograph/astrograph, destroy a pend card, draw 1, get chronograph/astrograph, summon them and activate their effects. Sky striker extra deck monsters: They are just there, you want to mainly summon kagari most of the time, and at the end phase if you have raye you can summon Shizuku. Crowley: A good card to collect a lot of spell counters if you summon it, since you'll be able to pick the 3 spell book cards you have in your deck. Regardless of what your opponent picks, they are all good. You want to summon this card only when you didnt use your normal summon, and you don't have any of the spellbook cards in your hand.  This is the deck in general, it might have been a bit of rushed, and if so i advice you to watch the Pend god tutorial himself, However his deck might be a bit outdated with the new banlists.

I'm personally not a fan of pile decks. Every powerful staple and engine packed together abusing the lack of xenophobia with the single goal of trying to break the game with what konami has to offer. Halq combos have reached linkross levels of bullcrap again and a competent deck may cost you 4 digits. You might have a different opinion on pile decks, and it's okay to be in the wrong, but I think we can all agree that the past format was too expensive.</span>  <span>Enter, Albaz Strike. A promising new engine, a new playstyle and all that in the form of a structure deck. For only 30 bucks you too can play competitive Yu-Gi-Oh. Branded Despia, the probably strongest way to play this deck according to the OCG, still costs a lot until <span><a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a></span> has it's reprint in GFTP 2nd Haunting but that doesn't mean that there are plenty of cheap and affordable version of this deck out there. Branded Tri-Brigade is up and coming, I'm sure the Invoked Shadoll Dogmatika Destiny HERO algamation has a way of integrating Branded, too and mark my words, Branded Melffy is gonna be a crazy deck once the support arrives.</span>  <span>For now, the version I chose to built doesn't have any of that...because it doesn't have anything else really. Introducing: <span>Branded Control</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Branded Fusion</span>  <span>If you don't know how Branded Fusion works this deck and any Branded deck for that matter might seem a little weird. I'm assuming most of you know how this works but I'll sum it up quickly. You use <span><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></span> to send <span><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></span> and either a LIGHT or DARK monster from your deck to the GY and use that Fusion Monster's effect to fuse itself with Albaz into <span class=""name_txt selectable""><span><a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</a></span><span>. Alternatively some decks use Albaz and the sent card to go for other, powerful Fusion Monsters like Dragoon or Winda. This deck sticks to Mirrorjade.</span></span></span>  <span>So here are the interactions with Branded Fusion and Mirrorjade.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong>Branded Fusion Targets</strong>:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""A&lt;a data-name=&quot;Absolute King Back Jack&quot;&gt;bsolute King &lt;/a&gt;Back Jack"">A</a><a data-name=""Absolute King Back Jack"">bsolute King </a><a data-name=""A&lt;a data-name=&quot;Absolute King Back Jack&quot;&gt;bsolute King &lt;/a&gt;Back Jack"">Back Jack</a></span><span>: A cool card with a cooler name. It gives you a chance to access another trap card on your opponent's turn and if you don't fear your</span> <span><a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a></span> <span>getting Belle'd you can even stack the top three cards of your deck.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Albion the Shrouded Dragon"">Albion the Shrouded Dragon</a></span><span>: In hand it functions like an</span> <span><a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a></span> <span>and if you opened</span> <span><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a></span> <span>you can send this instead of Back Jack. It's name becomes Fallen of Albaz while in the GY so if you use it's effect to mill</span> <span><a data-name=""Screams of the Branded"">Screams of the Branded</a></span> <span>the trap will trigger in the EP because it was sent by a card who's name was Fallen of Albaz. If you use Mirrorjade's effect you can then activate Torrential to destroy all monsters and then use Screams to summon your Mirrorjade again. Since it's considered a new copy and has only a ""soft"" once per turn clause you can then use Mirrorjade's effect again, meaning Screams translates into a non-targeted banish.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a></span> <span>&amp;</span> <span><a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a></span><span>:</span>Â <span><a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon </a></span><span>doesn't require a discard so if your hand is all traps it's better to keep them instead of discarding one only for Back Jack to <em>maybe</em> excavate another one. Also if you open</span> <span><a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a></span> <span>you can add the target back from the GY instead of discarding one for Lubellion and then adding the Dogmatika from deck. Branded is very punishing if you mismanage your card advantage so having LIGHT monster to fall back to is very nice. If you don't wanna play Dogmatika you can play</span> <span><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></span> <span>and/or</span> <span><a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a></span> <span>instead.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span><strong>Mirrorjade Targets </strong>(all this also applies for</span> <span><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a></span><span>):</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a></span><span>: Adds you Branded Fusion to your hand during the EP. The worst of the bunch since you don't really need it for anything but summoning Mirrorjade but that makes it a good Punishment target if you don't need N'tss' effect. Keep in mind that you cannot Fusion Summon until the end of the turn after using Punishment.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a></span><span>: Adds your or Special Summons Ecclesia who then searches you Fleurdelis. Attacking with Mirrorjade and both Dogmatika's also equals 8000 damage. Great way to threaten lethal and also good follow-up.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Brigrand the Glory Dragon"">Brigrand the Glory Dragon</a></span><span>: Accesses you</span> <span><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Mercourier"">Tri-Brigade Mercourier</a></span><span>. Starting your turn with an extra monster effect negate in hand is crazy strong and helps with keeping up the pressure so your opponent won't be able to outgrind you.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span>Control Cards</span>  <span>Almost half your deck is backrow.</span> <span><a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a></span> <span>(IDP) is great for the mirror match. Steal their Albaz and keep it so they won't be able to fuse it away. Back Jack can only set Normal Traps so even if you have Veiler I highly recommend playing</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a></span><span>. Solemn cards are insanely powerful and</span> <span><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a></span> <span>plus IDP or Torrential can even wipe a fully established board even when going second.</span> <span><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a></span> <span>is a really strong floodgate that you can side in game 2 or 3 when you know you're going first. It's pretty bad against an established board and does next to nothing against Adventurer Prank-Kids, one of the strongest decks atm, so don't put this one in your Main Deck. It's a perfect fit for the Side Deck. Since you are lacking any other engine you're Extra Deck isn't too tight so</span> <span><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a></span> <span>can help you out a great deal. You have 3 Mirrorjade and 4 monsters that can summon Mirrorjade. 4 targets for Mirrorjade and 2 additional targets for Punishment. 2</span> <span><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></span> <span>targets that only matter game 2 and/or 3 and Poly can be fired before the Main Phase, allowing your to still use Pot without the risk of banishing your targets for Super Poly. So while there will be rare instances of banishing all 3 Mirrorjade you play enough targets for your individual effects that you don't need to be afraid of using Extrav. Worst case it's Dogmatika beatdown with a bunch of traps at your disposal.</span>  <span>Budget Options</span>  <span>As I said, Aluber is way to expensive so feel free to play <span><a data-name=""Springans Kitt"">Springans Kitt</a></span> instead. It's a little more punishing on card advantage but searches Branded Fusion just as well. <span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></span> will always be relevant and I can't recommend buying a playset enough but if you want you can play Ogre/Veiler instead. If you don't want to play IDP you could play other trap cards as long as they are Normal Traps. It's a lot worse going second but cards like <span><a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a></span> can also deal with your opponent's Albaz if you don't wanna lose the edge on your opponent in the mirror match. The Dogmatika package doesn't cost mutch but if you don't want to spend more money on cards and have a DPE lying around you could play <span><a data-name=""Destiny Fusion"">Destiny Fusion</a></span> instead. If you do that do be prepared to have Prosperity and Destiny Fusion clash if you draw both. If you wanna be a little safer there's <span><a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a></span>. Six normal summons isn't too many. Playing either allows you to cut Titaniklad to increase the ratio of your other ED monsters to decrease the chances of having all copies of one banished by Extrav. Still, I highly recommend the Dogmatika engine over any of those two options in this deck.Â </span>  &nbsp;  <span>// Not enough Branded cards to be labelled correctly. Guess I'll sacrifice the deckprofile's Side Deck.</span>"

That limits special summons and graveyard plays. However, there are enough fusion cards and diverse monsters to go into what the situation requires. First Darklord is a big body that prevents effects that target dark fairies (IE Main-deck Despia and Scythe and Dark Honest). Mysterion is good for superpoly, can out dragons and spellcasters, as are both Predaplant fusion monsters, who not only out fusion and dark monsters using super poly, but have good negation effects. Levianeer is a good free summon that can thin hands, and Shaddoll Dragon is for making Winda and for using as material since it lets you pop a backrow. Because I'm running so many spells, Engage and Widow Anchor. Two Crossouts and a suite of handtraps to both use or negate with Crossout.  &nbsp;  (Note: Ignore the boss monster bar, it doesn't represent the deck. There is no way to edit them.)"

(Looking at your Dragonmaids)- well then, Gladiator Beasts may be the deck for you","Maybe I've been enjoying too much Edison lately, but man does this deck feel great to play- when you can play it. They're back from their 2010s glory with a fresh coat of ""wait, Andal's actually bad"" paint and a theme park sheen that'll probably convince opponents that this thing's actually pretty competitive. The spell and trap line-up should definitely change with each iteration of the format and any future releases; however, the core that's presented here is probably long-standing enough to supplement future variants. Let's get into the list.  <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Safety Nets</span>: The sheer amount of disruption and answer cards we're running in this list make it so that our plays are usually insulated in some way. We should never, ever really be in any remote danger during a game as long as we have a Gladiator Beast and a backline to back them up.</li>  	<li><span>Amazement Engine</span>: This engine isn't the best, but it's definitely non-intrusive and cycles through enough psuedo-disruption and removal that's relevant enough to run parallel to our gameplan here. Honestly, this archetype goes hand-in-hand with Gladiator Beasts as a whole. Just mind your normal summon.</li>  	<li><span>No Andal!</span>: Rescue Rabbit openers and lines are great for getting into Panther or Dragases or setting up a three material fusion but boy did it suck drawing into that card and not having it be able to tag out like the others. Well, there's none of that anymore. We've compromised the Andal combos and random chance of drawing into Rescue Rabbit before it in the interest of having more playable hands overall. Just protect your guy(s) and run over the opponents. There's no need for any fancy business.</li> </ul> <strong>Cons:</strong> <ul>  	<li><span>They're all Garnets. All of them</span>: Opening a Gladiator Beast will probably have you saying ""man, I wish this one stayed in the deck or was another Gladiator Beast."" That's basically this deck's entire experience and why we're only playing the ones that matter. Sadly, that little dilemma will always remain in this deck and there isn't much to be done about it outside of Contact Fusing or bringing out Augustus. It feels even worse that a Trinity is being spent on Proving Ground just to increase the odds of finding a Glad, especially in a pinch. Pick a Glad and pray.</li>  	<li><span>Extra Deck</span>:Â  The Extra Deck will usually be useless sometimes if you find yourself in a situation where you need to break down a board before you start committing to anything flashy. It's for this reason that we're not on any Extra Deck Trinities here and I'd personally advise against it. Fortunately, this does also mean that we're pretty insulated against cards like Titanocider which is pretty popular this format.</li>  	<li><span>Forehead Girl is an FTK</span>: Ash solos. Godspeed.</li> </ul> Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.  <hr />  <strong>OPENERS</strong>  This list isn't about finding gas, it's about opening defenses and protecting your Gladiator. You'll ideally be wanting to always go first. If you're going with no backup, I'd strongly encourage just combat tricking out the opponent. There isn't any specific opener you'll want to look for since Gladiator Beasts take on a midrange playstyle here (without Andal anyway), so your opening hands determine your line of play. Here's a few pointers though if you're inexperienced with them or the Amazement engine: <ul>  	<li><strong>Phalanx: </strong>Control a Gladiator Beast and protect them with backrow. If there's something you can use to either change a monster's battle position to make them vulnerable on your turn or modify combat stats so your monster will survive the attack, that's ideal.</li>  	<li><strong>The Blender:</strong> The Amazement engine does well to shake up the usual flow of some games. If you happen upon a Ticket and you're not sure what to do with it entirely, going for Comica and setting Horror House is perfectly fine. If you know you'll be able to beat the monster you book, then you can resolve it on the opponent's monster. If you're confident you can get a lot more mileage out of Comica, use Horror House during the Draw Phase and equip it directly to her. This will enable her to act as a monster negate or book of moon on the dime. I recommend trying to be greedy with Comica when possible, especially if you have back row to back her up. Cashing in for the set effect from Horror House is great too, but the monster effect negation is basically infinite for as long as you can maintain it. Grabbing Coaster or Arlekino are fine as well. Arlekino should primarily be used as a means of removal more than just being a body. You don't really need those in this deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Ob-Noxious:</strong> If you've opened Noxious and backrow, feel free to set those cards and outright pass. Usually people will just attack you outright, so you punish with Noxious. Bin either something you want to bring back with Darius (who Noxious will tag out into after) or bin something you don't want to draw, like Augustus. Tag as appropriate.</li> </ul> The openers aren't always ideal and will vary from game-to-game, especially post-siding. The main thing to do is plan ahead. Measure your options and weigh your forms of interaction well. Everything in your deck is an extremely limited resource and this deck lacks card draw.  <strong>MIDGAME </strong>  This is where Gladiator Beasts shine really. You'll be doing your best Unchained-meets-Dragonmaid impression here... despite preceding both of those archetypes. Hmm. <ul>  	<li><strong>Bestiari: </strong>Your Spell/Trap removal. This card's also really important for making Gyzarus who is your Icarus Attack on-summon. S/T hate's pretty restricted across the board in Trinity format and most decks only rely on generics to get it done. Since Glad Beasts tag out often, you have this form of removal going for you on top of the generic removal you're already running here. It's worth noting that this card's effect to destroy is mandatory, so don't summon it willy-nilly otherwise you might end up having to pop your own backline.</li>  	<li><strong>Murmillo: </strong>Your Monster removal. This card's your go-to for checking the board and clearing potential threats. Its combat stats leave much to be desired, but it doesn't have to partake in combat if it's already won now has it? Use it for fusion material when you can, or take an open attack. Don't get greedy with the fish.</li>  	<li><strong>The Tag Team:Â </strong>Gladiator Beast War Chariot's an amazing Counter Trap and since most win conditions in Trinity format revolve around Monster effects, having access to this is nothing to scoff at. Samnite grabs this for you and Equeste loops this for you. Loop these two as necessary to keep up the War Chariot pressure and you'll have your opponent on the ropes.</li> </ul> Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame due to all of the removal, but Gladiator Beasts can definitely go into a late or grind game.  <strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS </strong>  The killing blow. Leave absolutely no room for a comeback. This is the Gladiator's Proving Ground. <ul>  	<li><strong>Secutor: </strong>Resolving Secutor once basically wins the game on the spot. Resolving it during the opponent's turn? Well, that's probably traumatizing to say the least. Ideally you'll be wanting to bring out those that are all-stars in the midgame (as listed above); however, if you're ready to go in for the kill, summon out Laquari or Vespasius instead for fusion setups we'll cover just below.</li>  	<li><strong>Domitianus: </strong>Monster effect activation negation with no cost whatsoever and dictates who attacks who during your opponent's turn? Make this when you know it's a valid win condition. Just keep in mind that it only tags out into only 1 other Gladiator Beast. This card is really bad to use mid game as a result since, if it would fall, you would be put severely behind for the contact fusion play. Don't be greedy with Domitianus.</li>  	<li><strong>Heraklinos: </strong>Your Spell/Trap activation negation station. This card ain't even once per turn. As long as you have cards to discard, you can keep up the suffocation against your opponent. Unfortunately, this card doesn't have a tag out nor a float, so it should be used exclusively as a finisher where you're confident it will win. If it happens to get removed, you'll be set back pretty far.</li> </ul>  <hr />  The most important thing to note about this list is that any and all Spell/Traps selected here can and should be experimented with and swapped out to fit your playstyle with the deck in a given format. This is not a one size fits all situation and due to the variance concerning the hands, the learning curve with deciphering the best way to spend one's opening turns is definitely pretty steep. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:  <em>Melffy engine with Andal, Traptrix/Gokipole engine, Trinities on Gladiator Beast's Comeback, Geartown engine, Loop of Destruction, Ancient Warriors - Ambitious Cao De, Amazement Ambassador Bufo, Amazement Precious Park, Archfiend's Staff of Despair, Gladiator Beast's Battle Manica, Burden of the Mighty </em>  Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! This deck's a classic in Yu-Gi-Oh! history and it's honestly incredible to see it in a playable state in modern Trinity's climate. But don't just take my word for it- step on up into the Colosseum to Disarm, Parry, and Lash out against any and all who oppose your bestial fury!"

Epigonen, the Impersonation Invader is still part of the deck given the sheer power of the card in ABC.  While you're looking to end on Therions' ""King"" Regulus, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, DESTINY Hero - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, ABC Dragon Buster, and I:P Masquerena - be sure to destroy Verte with DPE before reviving DPE during the standby phase so that you have enough monster zones to utilize Dragon Buster's tag out effect. Nevertheless, you'll have four forms of disruption with Masquerena leading into the summon of an Appolousa with four negates or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, which can be summoned with an opponent's monster, when paired with the pieces summoned through Dragon Buster's ability to tag out.  If you open optimally, you can also end, if you soÂ  wish, on Regulus, Verte, DPE, Dragon Buster, and an Appolousa with three negates and with an immunity to destruction effects via Masquerena's effect. You'll still want to clear Verte from the field for the aforementioned reason. I wish I didn't have to remove the PSY-Frame engine from the main deck but it's still present in the side.  I've updated the deck to utilize Artifact Dagda and Artifact Scythe. Whether you choose to rely on the Scythe lock, potentially to the detriment of bearing additional forms of disruption, is up to your preference and the matchup at hand. Although, if you open optimally, you can end on I:P + Verte + Regulus + ABC Dragon Buster (+ Dagda?) with a set Artifact Scythe. Whether Dagda is to be used as material for Verte or be left on the field is dependent on your opening but be sure to ensure there is enough space for Dragon Buster to tag out by destroying Verte and Dagda if necessary via DPE's effect on your own turn. All in all, it is rather easy to set up the DPE and Scythe combo, with there being paths to which enable the combo depending on your opening, in this build for the sake of abusing the Scythe lock."

Additionally I opted for El Shaddol Fusion over Super Poly because it can be recovered using the Shaddoll fusion monsters.  For a more true budget friendly build: Ecclesia and Prosperity in the main can be swapped for golden swordwoul and a third copy of extravagance, and Selene/Accesscode in the extra deck can be swapped for a second copy of Brigand and a copy of Triple Burst Dragon."

Quickly get out Mirrorjade and have a few other fusions to back him up. I am still fairly new to the Despia deck so I can't make some crazy amount of combos and stuff you can do with the deck like I have done with my other deck lists on this site so feel free to look and change whatever you feel is necessary for your playstyle and what you are looking for. I am just using cards I think are underrated in the deck and are actually way better than they seem. I am also playing some of the newer cards like Albaz the Ashen because I think the card will be really good when it comes out and also because it has the main deck Albion effect of having its name be treated as Fallen of Albaz.  &nbsp;  That is al for the summery. I hope you enjoy the deck and remember- ALBAZ AND BRANDED/DESPIA DESERVED THE MANGA TREATMENT AND NOT SKY STRIKER UGH!!!

Surely it's a ""Lightsworn"" and ""Chaos"" Deck, but those are just the engines used to turbo out Scythe Lock.  As someone who dislikes and wishes that Scythe is banned forever and ever because of how annoying and toxic it is, I'm very ashamed to say that I got to Plat 1 this season with 9 winstreaks using Scythe Lock Turbo. Probably my most successful Deck so far, even beating my Adamancipator Deck. And all it takes is just ONE. BAD. DAY. I was playing Dragon Link a while ago (because I have like 80% of the cards), and drop from Plat 2 to Plat 4 in just an hour or so. So I just decided to ruin people day with Scythe Lock the next day, and I got to Plat 1 along the way.  There are multiple variants of Scythe Lock Turbo, and I chose Chaos Danger! Lightsworn because it's my favorite Deck. And now I have tainted it... <h1>Objective</h1> This is a Combo Deck, but I'm not gonna show a 1-2 card Combo because the Combo varies and have many different lines. However, all of the Combo really are trying to accomplish one thing: Scythe Locking your opponent.  Ok, I haven't explained what a ""Scythe Lock"" is. For people who lived under a rock and never heard of it, Scythe Lock is basically a floodgate caused by the effect of <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>. If Artifact Scythe is popped during your opponent's turn, it will Special itself from GY and if it's Special Summoned during your opponent's turn, your opponent cannot use their Extra Deck for the rest of the turn, and this is a Lingering effect, meaning that after it resolves, it can no longer be negated. So basically Dimensional Barrier but stronger. Scythe Lock was never been consistent in the past, that is until <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a> came into the game (They happened to came out from the same Set. Oh Konami, maybe you planned this?) Crystron Halqifibrax can banish itself to Synchro into <a data-name=""T.G. Wonder Magician"">T.G. Wonder Magician</a> (yes this is treated as a Synchro Summon) whose on Summon can pop 1 Spell/Trap (in this case pop your own Scythe). Artifact Dagda can Set an Artifact directly from your Deck when a card or effect on the field is activated. And after that, you can Quick Synchro Scythe and Wonder Magician into Baronne. And boi, those two Link Monsters are SO GENERIC. And it got way worse when DPE came out. Literally any 4 monsters = Scythe Lock while also giving you a broken Boss Monster that pop things and come back every single turn.  Ok now let's actually go into the Deck's objective: <h3>Starter</h3> You will start your play with either <a data-name=""Charge of the Light Brigade"">Charge of the Light Brigade</a> or <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> into Psi-Reflector. Psi-Reflector is a 1 card Halqifibrax/<a data-name=""Chaos Ruler"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>. Psi-Reflector can search <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> on Summon and Assault Beast can discard itself to search <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a>. Psi-Reflector can then reveal the Assault Mode Activate to Summon Assault Beast from GY and increases Assault Beast's Level by 1-4.  Charge of Light Brigade can mill 3 cards as <strong>COST</strong> and search <a data-name=""Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"">Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn</a>. Raiden can mill 2 cards for free (and bait a handtrap if your opponent isn't smart) and just happened to be a Level 4 Tuner, which is an important factor. Then you can Summon a Level 4 monster, either through Raiden's mill (<a data-name=""Wulf, Lightsworn Beast"">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a> or <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>) or from your hand (<a data-name=""Danger! Mothman"">Danger! Mothman</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Danger! Mothman&quot;&gt;Danger! Mothman&lt;/a&gt;!"">!</a>/<a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a>, <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverbuster"">White Dragon Wyverbuster</a>/<a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>, or <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>). Black/White Dragon can be searched through <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>. With those 2 monsters, you can then Synchro into Chaos Ruler which can excavate 5 cards, add 1 LIGHT or DARK monster from it, and send the rest to the GY. You can easily chain block Chaos Ruler with Black/White Dragon to avoid getting ashed.  There's also an alternative line where you have neither Charge/Raiden or E-Tele/Psi-Reflector. In this case, you can just spam DARK monsters in order to Link into <a data-name=""Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion"">Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion</a>. This is easily achievable thanks to the Danger! archetype. All the Danger! used in this Deck has different Types while also being DARK. This is enough to fulfill Curious's materials. Not only that, these Danger! also happened to have different Types with your other DARK monsters (Dragon, Zombie, Psychic). <h3>Goal</h3> Chaos Ruler was just an Extender to get a ton of card advantages before actually setting up your Scythe Lock. All you have to do to set up the Scythe Lock is Link into Halqifibrax using any resources you have and Summon <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> from Deck, then you can Link Jet Synchron into <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and Jet Synchron can revive itself from GY so you can make Dagda. You don't need to Trigger Dagda on your own turn as it will Trigger from Halqifibrax 2nd Effect on your opponent's turn. Additionally, if you have Chaos Ruler on the field already, instead of Linking into Linkuriboh, you can Synchro Jet Synchron and Chaos Ruler into <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>. Then you can revive Chaos Ruler and Jet Synchron with their own respective Effects to make Dagda. <h3>Extra Objective</h3> This part is optional and only happens when you're lucky enough to have the resources to do so.  If you happen to have <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, you can make <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> with it and Chaos Ruler. It can protect your monsters from battle (once) while also being a Spell Negate. Curious can then used to make 2 material <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>. It's not much, but it can at least protect you from Nibiru. You can easily caught your opponent off guard on this 6th Summon because your opponent probably won't Nibiru 2 monsters, including Curious (which can add <strong>ANY</strong> card from GY if it gets Nibiru'd).  If you have some Extra Level 4 monsters, you can make <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>. Dweller can completely prevents your opponent from activating GY Effects for an entire turn (or 2 turns even, since it has 2 materials), and this is yet another Lingering Effect just like Scythe. Dweller might win you games on its own against certain matchups like Drytron or Tri-Brigade who relies on GY Effect to make plays. Dweller is also a go-to card to make when you get Maxx ""C""-ed and don't want to give your opponent too many advantages while also making a decent board to not die.  After Dagda does its job and Set Scythe, you can use it as Link Fodder for Apollousa. <h1>Deck Breakdown</h1> <h3>Main Deck</h3> <p>3x <a data-name=""Charge of the Light Brigade"">Charge of the Light Brigade</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"">Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Wulf, Lightsworn Beast"">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a></p> <p>This is the Lightsworn Engine. This is not exactly a Lightsworn Deck, that's why I only play 3 different Main Deck Lightsworn cards. So basically, the way the Engine works is very simple. <strong>Charge of Light Brigade</strong> mill 3 cards and search a Lightsworn. The mill is a cost and the actual Effect is the search, so if it got negated (by <strong>Ash</strong> or something), you still mill 3 cards regardless. Then you can Normal Summon <strong>Raiden</strong> (searched by <strong>Charge</strong>) which can mill 2 cards which is funny because a lot of people decided to Ash, Veiler, or Imperm it despite having such a mediocre Effect. <strong>Raiden</strong> is also a Tuner, so its perfect for <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> and <strong>Halqifibrax</strong>. Lastly we have <strong>Wulf</strong>, a Level 4 monster that Special itself when sent from Deck to the GY. Its a dead card if you draw it, otherwise Free Summon. I only play 2 copies because I cut the 3rd one for <strong>Trick Clown</strong> which is basically <strong>Wulf</strong>, but Special itself when sent to the GY regardless from where (<strong>Wulf</strong> isn't once per turn though).</p> <p>3x <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>; 1x <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverbuster"">White Dragon Wyverbuster</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a></p> <p>This is the Chaos part of the Deck. Not too many Chaos monsters, but I picked the best ones out there. <strong>Chaos Space</strong> search any LIGHT or DARK Level 4-8 monster that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set by sending a monster with the opposite Attribute from hand to GY. This pretty much searches all your Chaos monsters. It also has a neat GY Effect to recycle your banished LIGHT or DARK monster that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set to the bottom of your Deck and draw 1. Your best target for <strong>Chaos Space</strong> is <strong>Black/White Dragon</strong>. But if you already have them or milled them, you can search <strong>Levianeer</strong> (DARK) or <strong>Valkyria</strong> (LIGHT) instead.</p> <p><strong>Levianeer</strong> is pretty much the best Extender you can ever ask for. Easy to Summon, great Effects with great versatility. You can either shuffle 1 card from your opponent's hand into the Deck or Special ANY monster from GY in Defense, or even pop 2 cards without targeting if you go 2nd. <strong>Seyfert</strong> can banish itself from GY to add back <strong>Levianeer</strong> from GY and Levianeer inherent Summon is not once per turn. I only play 2 copies of <strong>Levianeer</strong> though, because I don't want to see it in my opening hand without any GY setup.</p> <p><strong>Black/White Dragon</strong> is a Free Summon from hand and searches each other when sent from the field to the GY. Since you will be searching them with <strong>Chaos Space</strong> 90% of the time, you can actually use <strong>Chaos Space</strong> 2nd Effect to recycle your banished <strong>Black/White Dragon</strong> so you can get 2 searches instead of 1. <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> serves the same purpose, except she doesn't replace herself with another monster like <strong>Black/White Dragon</strong> does. But since all of their Special Summon Effect are once per turn, its better to play <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> than a 2nd Copy of the dragons. Also, <strong>Chaos Valkyria</strong> can send ANY LIGHT or DARK monster from Deck to GY when banished. Although, just like <strong>Shooting Riser Dragon</strong>, you can't use their Effects this turn. Best target for this is <strong>Snow</strong>. If you already milled <strong>Snow</strong>, <strong>Seyfert</strong> and <strong>Levianeer</strong> is the best target for follow-up.</p> <p>3x <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a></p> <p>This is the <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> Engine. As I mentioned earlier, <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> can search up <strong>Assault Beast</strong> on Summon and <strong>Assault Beast</strong> can search <strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong> by discarding itself. Then, <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> can reveal <strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong> to Summon <strong>Assault Beast</strong> from GY, modifying its Level to 5-8 allowing you to Synchro into a Level 6-9 Synchro. And guess what? <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> just happened to be a Psychic, meaning that <strong>E-Tele</strong> can Special it from Deck. So you can go into <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> without your Normal Summon. If you milled <strong>Assault Beast</strong>, that's no problem because <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> can also search <strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong> itself. But if you milled<strong> Assault Mode Activate</strong>, your engine is dead.</p> <p>3x <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Danger! Chupacabra!</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Danger!? Jackalope?"">Danger!? Jackalope?</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a></p> <p>The Danger! archetype just happened to synergize very well with Lightsworn, because if you draw a garnet, you can use the Danger! in order to put them to the GY while going pluses. Being able to freely Summon themselves while discarding a card at random, then draw 1. When they discard themself, they have some good Effects too. They also happened to have different Types, so you can go into <strong>Curious</strong> easier than ever.</p> <p>You want to prioritize <strong>Mothman</strong> and <strong>Chupacabra</strong> because they're Level 4 and try avoiding using a Danger! that you have 2 ofs in your hand, because the chances of discarding themselves are doubled (unless you want their discarded Effect).</p> <p>2x <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon Frisson</a>; 2x <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a></p> <p>These are the Tuners that can Special Themselves from GY. <strong>Destrudo</strong> pretty much Special almost for Free by paying half your LP, <strong>Plague</strong> by returning a card from hand to topdeck, and <strong>Jet</strong> by sending a card from hand to GY. <strong>Destrudo</strong> and <strong>Jet</strong> are once per turn while <strong>Plague</strong> isn't. <strong>Jet</strong> will be your main target for Halqifibrax, and if you already milled <strong>Jet</strong>, Summon <strong>Plague</strong> instead. You can make <strong>Destrudo</strong> Level 4 by targeting <strong>Jackalope</strong> or <strong>Tsuchinoko</strong>. I only play 1 <strong>Jet</strong> because it's searchable with <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> and only once per turn.</p> <p>1x <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow"">Fairy Tail - Snow</a>; 1x <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a></p> <p>I already explained everything with <strong>Scythe</strong> so I'm gonna skip it. <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> is just a good card to play in a GY Deck, you shouldn't use the card immediately, Set it first and use it last to send an Important combo piece that you're missing. <strong>Trick Clown</strong> is basically <strong>Wulf</strong> but better. <strong>Snow</strong> is an amazing card that serves as both an Extender and a disruption, just don't overuse its GY Effect since we don't play <strong>Grass</strong>. <strong>Gokipole</strong> is a Free +1, it's basically <strong>Shaddoll Beast</strong> but better because it searches <strong>Mothman</strong> when sent to the GY.</p> <p>3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>; 3x <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a>; 2x <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a>; 1x <a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a></p> <p>These are your handtraps. Not much I can say about them, except for the fact that <strong>Gamma</strong> is a +2. When you <strong>Charge</strong>, <strong>Chaos Space</strong>, or <strong>E-Tele</strong> and got <strong>Ash</strong>-ed or <strong>Maxx ""C""</strong>-ed on your Danger! Just Click <strong>Gamma</strong> and boom, your opponent loses a card for no reason and you just got 2 monsters for Free (1 from hand, 1 from Deck), and <strong>Gamma</strong> just happened to be a Tuner and their combined Levels are 8, which is <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong>. There's a reason why <strong>Gamma</strong> is at 2 (at 1 in OCG right now) while other handtraps are unlimited, even though you must play a garnet (<strong>Driver</strong>) for <strong>Gamma</strong>.</p> &nbsp; <h3>Extra Deck</h3> 1x <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>:Â That one generic Level 10 Synchro that Negates things. You don't usually Synchro into Baronne on your own turn, except for going 2nd. That's because you can just do it during your opponent's turn with Wonder Magician and Scythe. Baronne also have a once per turn pop for some reason. And the 3rd Effect does come up, if you accidentally milled Scythe, don't worry because Baronne can bring Scythe back on Standby Phase (Scythe doesn't need to be popped to Lock your opponent, just Special Summoned).  1x <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>:Â Since you're playing Chaos Ruler and Jet Synchron, why not make this guy? This guy has a unique Negation Effect because it targets. Since you're summoning Baronne on your opponent's turn, Abyss is the Omni-Negate that you want to Summon on your own turn. Sadly it can't Negate hand and/or GY effects (can't be chain blocked though). It has a 2nd Effect, to revive a Tuner from GY when it inflicts damage.  1x <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>:Â Very balanced card I guess, mill 4 add 1. AND it revives itself from GY with some little cost that is by banishing 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK from hand or GY. Also, mandatory for Abyss's Synchro material.  1x <a data-name=""T.G. Wonder Magician"">T.G. Wonder Magician</a>:Â Halqifibrax target, can pop Scythe, and Quick Synchro into Baronne.  1x <a data-name=""Number 38"">Number 38</a>:Â I'm not saying its full name because that would be 2 colons (:) which is confusing to read. Anyway, good card because it can protect your monsters from battle once per turn by directing the attack into itself. If your opponent doesn't read, good for you. Also it can Negate Spell once per turn. You need to use Levianeer to Summon it because there's no other Level 8 monster in the Deck (Omega is Level 8 but I'm not wasting that for Xyz).  1x <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a> (previously <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>): Ok, I didn't take into consideration about going 2nd, that's why I thought Minerva wasn't that good since I'm only playing 5 Lightsworn Main Deck monsters and thought, why not just go Dweller if you have the materials? Turns out Minerva is very good at baiting negation. If your opponent let your Minerva resolves, you have the ""potential"" to draw 3 cards. Even if they Negate and destroy it, they have to Negate the GY Effect too, or they ""might"" lose 1-3 cards for no reason. Omega is the one I replaced, because it was the least useful EX monster.  1x <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>:Â Literally the best Rank 4 I can think of. Forget Minerva and Dugares, if you have 2 Level 4s, just make Dweller. Can win you games on its own against certain matchup as it disables your opponent GY Effect for potentially 2 full turns.  1x <a data-name=""Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion"">Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion</a>:Â Foolish Burial + 3 mills. Actually its not just Foolish Burial because it can send Spell/Trap too. You will most likely mill Plague, or Destrudo, or maybe Snow. Also, it floats into adding any card from GY to hand.  1x <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>:Â The big boy himself, as long as you can spam monsters, Accesscode will always be in your EX.  1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>:Â It's mandatory at this point to play Unicorn if you play Accesscode, there's no other good generic Link-3.  1x <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>:Â I'm genuinely too lazy to write anything about this card.  1x <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a>:Â Set Scythe from Deck, that's it. Wait, it has a 2nd Effect? No one told me that!  1x <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>:Â <span>Ok, how many times do I have to talk about this card? Hopefully next Combo Deck won't play Halq so I can finally stop explaining the same Effect over and over again. So basically, Halq Summon a Level 3 or lower Tuner from Deck, ""but it cannot activate its effects this turn"" and still get abused anyway. It can also Summon a Tuner Synchro from Extra for some reason. If 1 broken Effect is not enough, why not give it another?</span>  1x <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>:Â You need Linkuriboh to convert Jet Synchron into 2 monsters for Dagda. It doesn't happen very often in this Deck, but still happen occasionally  1x <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>:Â Just a monster Negate that you can Summon if you have too many extra monsters that you don't need  (I'm just gonna leave Halq blank like that, don't ask why) <h1>Conclusions</h1> First and most importantly, is the Deck consistent? Surely you're playing plenty of garnets, but I gotta say, this Deck is very consistent. All you need is just 2 monsters, including a Tuner and you have Full Combo. And to answer the reason why I don't play Grass, that's because there's not that many GY Effects really in this Deck, so Grass is not really needed.  This Deck can play through multiple handtraps due to the number of Extenders it has, the choke point is pretty much Chaos Ruler or Halqifibrax. Unfortunately, this variant of CDL cannot play through Nibiru as good as the other variants can, because you don't turbo out Baronne like usual.  For handtraps, we have 11 handtraps which is around 60% chance to open 1 of them on your opening hand. Can this Deck play through Maxx ""C""? Bro. Just. Draw. The. Gamma. Jokes aside, yes you can play through Maxx ""C"". It definitely can't Deck them out, but just Scythe Lock your opponent and their 20+ cards means nothing (If they draw an equalizer or Called By, you're screwed). Just Dweller pass them if you got Maxx ""C""-ed.  I don't play Called By because I don't have the space for it. Looks like 60-card is just not enough because there's just too many good cards to play. I can't just replace handtraps for it because I'm telling you, you're gonna need those handtraps going 2nd.  The weakness of the Deck is... It loses to Control Deck. There's nothing you can do about it, unless you want to play Lightning Storm/Twin Twister which is sure, go ahead. But Combo/Midrange Decks are just more common in the Ladder compared to Control. Also, playing both Danger! and hantraps SUCKS. Sometimes you just have to sacrifice your handtrap for extending and there's nothing that you can do about it.  If you have any question about the Deck, or any suggestion to make, feel free to tell me in the comments, I'll try answering them as much as possible.  As someone who hates Scythe Lock with PASSION, I have learned something important from this Deck: <em>""If you can't beat them, join them :)""</em>  (This is the non-optimized Decklist that I used that got me to Plat 1)  <img class="""" src=""https://i.imgur.com/J9LSWC5.png"" alt="""" width=""764"" height=""430"" />  <strong>23 Apr 2022</strong>: Replaced <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a> with <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a>"

Then Rank climb until you get Seven materials attached to your monster. Use Shien's spy on that monster to give it to your opponent. Xyz summon Mischief and use the spell Overlay Capture to raise Mischief to 10 materials and enjoy your opponent's confusion.

Control the board, then OTK! Expecting your opponent to f","An updated, more competitive version of my Charmer Control deck I previously featured back in February. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/charming-control-2022/"">For a more detailed explanation of this deck, click here.</a> This decklist is just so I can do test-hands on my phone so I can practice for locals.  The idea is to go first, control the board, then OTK. OTKs are easily enabled by ""Awakening of the Possessed"" boosting up your monster's attack to ridiculous levels for each attribute on your field. The Adventurer and Dogmatika Engine provide free special summons/attributes for the OTK, as well as interactions that hinder your opponent. Lord of the Heavenly Prison also greatly enhances the deck, since it is a massive free body on board, and searches out any of your important spells like Rite of Aramesia, Spirit Charmers, or Nadir's Servant. Ice Dragon's Prison and Crackdown are the normal traps of choice for this deck, since they eviscerate current meta decks and also provide link material so you can link your opponent's monster away for your Extra Deck charmers.  When you're expecting your opponent to force you to go second, you side in the Kaijus and going second cards by replacing the trap cards + Lord of the Heavenly Prison. Kaijus pick apart your opponent's board then the Kaijus are bounced back to your hand by Luna and Dracoback.  This deck has surprisingly won me many games online in Yugioh OMEGA and Masterduel vs. competitive decks as they are usually caught off guard by it. This deck is also very consistent and can shrug off many of the negates/interaction present in Yugioh nowadays, since it's a backrow control/beatdown deck. However, this deck relies on you to win the die roll and predict your opponent to force you to go second. If that happens you usually win with these charming spellcasters!  Enjoy and GLHF Duelists!"

The <strong>core idea</strong> of the deck is to summon some good troublemakers as <em>Fossil Dyna</em> and/or <em>Rai-Oh</em> whose effects will start blocking the opponent's moves. You want to do everything you can to defend the one which stops your opponent as much as possible and you have plenty of choices to do so.  The <em>Doomcaliber</em> is quite predictable, but a nice attacking monster which also creates some troubles. Also the <em>Grand Mole</em> is useful to push back the Synchros from where they come from. The <em>Veiler</em> is for emergencies and the <em>Banisher of the Radiance</em> is good if the opponent uses the graveyard (which is quite common)  Cards will go away very quickly from your hand and field since you will activate lots of traps and spells, that's why we have the <em>Morphing JarÂ </em>for a quick reload (might as well disrupt the opponent's plans) and the <em>Pots of Duality</em> do no interfere with our plans since we do not special summon a lot.  The <strong>extra deck</strong> is not relevant to our purposes except for what we could summon in the very rare occasion we use the <em>Veiler</em> as a tuner or when we activate the <em>Starlight Road</em>.  In the <strong>side deck</strong> we can keep cards based on the meta, but a strong suggestion is <a data-name=""King Tiger Wanghu"">King Tiger Wanghu</a>, which might literally ruin the day of an opponent and could easily be swapped in instead of the Banishers or any of the monsters we play according to the deck we are facing.  <em>Please feel free to explore my uploaded decks to find the evolution of my favourite one through the years in a way that reflects a little the story of the game itself! Leave your comments and like if I brought you back some sweet memories!</em>"

It also wouldn't allow me to add Maxx ""C"" to the side deck so that's what's currently missing. Glad my Ice Barriers got some love at some point after I stopped playing and I can now potentially make my IRL deck better, if I get back into playing! I don't know link monsters well enough yet to know what can be used but there is room to shorten your Extra deck, I'd suggest keeping 2 Gungnir though since he is the easiest to summon, with the best effect."

Yeah it's bascially that except it has waifus and can fusion summon from the gy. ,"This deck is excatly what you expect, you ns a Tearalament, mill some cards, activate some gy effects, fusion summon a bunch of times and end on winda + some other stuff.  Here is the stuff which makes it different to shaddoll invoked:  It can make Winda in the opponents turn without using schism. How? Simple you use Haufenis to summon herself and mill 3 cards or If you went first end made your board with Kitkalos and Salic, you negate an opponents monster eff with salic and send Kitkalos to the gy to mill 5 cards. Then If you milled an Shaddoll and a Tearalament you can use those to summon Winda. It sounds pretty rng based at first, but in the end it comes up more often than you would expect, especially if you used Kitkalos to mill 5.  It has access to Bahamut Shark, so it can make Toadally Awesome! The basic combo would be Rainoheart + any other Tearalament: Ns Rainoheart, Send a Tearalament monster to the gy, fusion summon Kitkalos, eff Kitkalos to Send Rainoheart, eff Kitkalos to ss Rainoheart, Overlay both Rainohearts for Bahamut Shark while also getting a mill 5 off of Kitkalos.  You always have some fuel for your schism, since you mill your entire deck in a couple of turns.  And the last point is that you basically have infinite Windas since you can just use a tearlament to recycle the Winda, so 2 Windas are a infinite loop (Hey That's the dante/cir loop, but in better). Btw I play 3 Windas, just because.. ehm... actaully idk it either. You can probably replace it with something else like a 2nd Gravity Controller, Abyss Dweller or a link monster like Underworld Godess or Knigmare Unicorn.  &nbsp;  Is it better than Shaddoll Invoked and Shaddoll Invoked Dogmatika?  Maybe, only time will tell, but there's definetley some potential here. It could definetley be better depending on the support we will get in Darkwing Blast, I personally think that it's either a Link-1 or another Fusion. And no matter what it is, if it's on the same level as the scareclaw link-1 then it could definetley be a meta contender.  &nbsp;  So yeah that's for the Shaddoll varient, next up is tearalaments despia/branded, Oh man that's gonna be fun..., until then!"

In place of those we're running pretty generic Fairies that can get us into cards other than Fusions and pretty easily swarm the field.Â </span>  <span>Getting VFD out is a 1-card combo using Diviner of the Herald. Summon Diviner, and send Trias Hierarchia with her effect. Use Hierarchia in the grave, and tribute Diviner to summon her. Diviner will proc, use her effect to summon Valkyrie Sechste. Sechste will proc, use her to summon Sigrun. Then just XYZ Sigrun and Hierarchia into VFD. You can use any other monsters you have after this too, such as an Aluber to grab Theater and use him and Sechste for Quaeritis, or using any other effect combination you have in hand.</span>  <span>Archlord Kristya is a floodgate than can be summoned by First Darklords effect should you get the opportunity to, for example by sending it with Diviner or Foolish Burial.Â </span>  <span>Everything else is relatively the same as a normal Despia Darklord deck. Draglubion + Numeron Dragon OTK combo, Starving Venom as a generic fusion, Condemned in case you actually want to summon Morningstar, and Apollousa as a generic negate (who, fun fact, is protected by First Darklord as it's a Fairy monster).Â </span>"

Over the years however, several cards have been released which unintentionally make it slightly easier to activate.  Ideally, you'd like to succeed in this combo during your first or second turn before your opponent can set up their board of negates. I've included some options in the side deck to help with stalling or going second.  Ideally your turn goes something like this, summon Dark Doriado which you can alternatively achieve through Summoner Monk. Excavate your cards, then activate Enchanting Fitting room which will special summon each of your necessary monsters for Huge Revolution to be activated. Set trap trick or huge revolution. The main issue with Huge Revolution is that it must be activated during YOUR main phase. So all three of your monsters must survive your opponents turn in order for you to activate Huge Revolution on your next turn. In case they don't, Tri-Wight and Monster Reborn are key cards to bring your monsters back after they've been destroyed. If you manage to complete the combo in your first turn, Temple of the Kings will allow you to activate Huge Revolution immediately.  &nbsp;  Another way to accomplish this combo is with Rescue Ferret and Saryuja Skull dread. If you have the furry emancipator in your hand and manage to get four monsters on the field to link summon Saryuja, you can special summon Rescue Ferret from your hand and activate its effect to special summon your three key monster cards from your deck.

You want to start with either Venus or a combo of dragonfly+hornet/gigamantis/ladybug.  If you start with venus, get 3 shineballs on the field in Def and XYZ into gantatsu.  Ideally with the inzektors, you want gigamantis attatched to dragonfly to give it some beatstick protection.  Gorz, torrential tribute, mirror force, etc. are generic support/defensive cards to use.  If you're able to use Tualatin against an opponent, you can lock them down.Â  Same with archlord Krystia.  Hyperion and BLS both are good at clearing the field.  I've recently added Trishula as the inzectors are very good at level manipulation, combined with Venus's ability to get multiple low-level monsters on the field.Â  Wish I would have thought of this years ago."

Thanks to Extra-Deck consistency tools like Tearalaments Kitkalos, the deck is quite consistent and capable of easily cycling through a variety of different Fusions to suit your needs. Ideally you will go first, summon Kitkalos, search out Tearalaments Salic and summon some number of Tearalaments and other Fusion monsters, but thanks to plentiful room for tech cards, handtraps and the archetypal handtrap of Tearalaments Haufenis, the deck is reasonably competent when going second. My ratios and reasoning are as follows:  Main Deck: <strong>3x Tearalaments RainoheartÂ </strong>- the main character of the deck and your most reliable starter. On summon he mills any Tearalaments monster to instantly make a fusion, usually Kitkalos, and he can be sent from the hand or deck off of a variety of cards to trigger his effect to special summon from the GY. Absolutely mandatory at 3, as he is the best normal summon and discard fodder in the deck, and most of the time you will either want to open him or search him out using Kitkalos or the Field Spell.  <strong>3x Tearalaments Shaylen</strong> - the archetypal extender. Shaylen is fantastic as she can be used to pitch any cloggy monsters in hand to trigger their effects while also milling 3 more cards from your deck, which will typically enable a fusion play. As this deck has a good amount of RNG involved in its plays, you want as many Tearalaments names as possible in the deck to ensure that Fusing is always available, so as of now I would argue every Tearalaments Monster should be played at 3.  <strong>3x Tearalaments Haufenis</strong> - an archetypal handtrap/extender. Haufenis relies on your opponent to trigger her hand effect, but in exchange enables some nasty Fusion combos on your opponents turn, including on turn 1 when you're going second. Depending on the cards you mill off of her, you can make a variety of powerful interruptions on your opponents turn such as Millennium-Eyes Restrict (if <strong>King of the Swamp</strong> is milled- more on this later), Predaplant Dragostapelia (after making Kitkalos and using her to mill a different Tearalaments monster), and even El Shaddoll Winda (if <strong>Shaddoll Beast </strong>is milled).  <strong>3x Tearalaments Mieru</strong>- arguably the worst of the bunch as she can clash with Rainoheart for your normal summon, Mieru gives you an additional option for milling cards to continue your combos and set up your GY. A common play is to summon her off of the effect of Kitkalos to mill 8 cards from your deck and almost always enable 1-2 Fusions.  <strong>3x King of the Swamp</strong>- King of the Swamp fulfills multiple roles in this deck, allowing you to search out Polymerization to allow for alternative methods of Fusing without relying on milling Tearalaments and also can serve as any specifically-named fusion material. King of the Swamp allows you to make far more than the otherwise limited pool of Fusions Tearalaments would be capable of making, most notably cards like Millennium-Eyes Restrict (who requires Relinquished as material) and Lubellion the Searing Dragon (who requires Fallen of Albaz as material). King of the Swamp is also an Aqua-type Monster, meaning it can serve as one of the generic materials for Kaleidoheart and Kitkalos, and it can also be used in place of Rainoheart in order to make Kaleidoheart. As you will be Fusing using materials in your GY, discarding it to search Polymerization essentially gives you free GY setup while searching you a potential extender. While you could theoretically play less than 3, the card gives you enough value and versatility that I currently max out on it.  <strong>2x Shaddoll Beast</strong>- a Shaddoll played to enable summons of El Shaddoll Winda. You could play any of the Shaddolls for this purpose, but I've found that Beast is generally the best as it gives you a Draw when sent off any of your card effects, such as any mill effect or if sent from the hand for Shaylen. I currently play 2 to ensure I see it frequently enough without bricking on them, but you could easily run more/less Shaddoll names by preference.  <strong>3x Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju / Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring / Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit / Infinite Impermanence</strong>- the going-second cards. These 12 flex spots could be anything you feel like playing to suit your particular meta, but I like these particular handtraps due to their versatility. I play 3x Gameciel as it is not only a powerful removal option (and this is somewhat lacking in non-targeting removal effects), but also because its Aqua typing allows it to be used as Fusion material for the Tearalaments Fusions if milled.  <strong>3x Perlayno, the Primal Parallel Ruined Realm / 1x Terraforming</strong>- the Field Spell(s). Perlayno searches for any Tearalaments Monster on activation, allowing more access to your combo pieces. Furthermore, Perlayno can pop a card onÂ <em>either field</em> whenever you use one of your Tearalaments' Fusion effects (once per turn), allowing you to break boards, have an additional interaction when Fusing on your opponent's turn, and trigger your cards that activate upon being sent to the GY (such as Kitkalos' effect to mill 5). I max out on the Field Spell as it isn't currently searchable and can grab any Tearalaments Monster you want, but you could drop Terraforming if you find it cloggy.  <strong>2x Polymerization / 1x Instant Fusion</strong>- Polymerization is here as a free card off of King of the Swamp and to enable alternative routes for Fusion Summoning, while Instant Fusion can be used to instantly make Kitkalos, who in turn searches for any Tearalaments card in your deck. Instant Fusion can also be used to make Time Wizard of Tomorrow to break boards, or Millennium-Eyes Restrict to counter some common handtraps and interactions. You could cut these cards if you find yourself wanting more room, but I've found this to be a comfortable ratio.  <strong>3x Tearalaments Salic</strong>- Salic serves as a reliable interruption, a consistency enabler and a method of Fusing during your opponent's turn. If milled or sent by any effect it searches for any Tearalaments monster, and utilizing the on-field negation effect allows you to trigger any of your Tearalaments effects at will. I run 3 as you want to both have one copy in hand and at least one to mill for the searching effect.  <strong>1x Tearalaments Metanoise</strong>- Metanoise gives you a Book of Moon-like interruption while also milling a Tearalaments monster in the process, allowing you an additional method of Fusing as a quick-effect. However, the GY effect of Metanoise is surprisingly niche as you'll rarely end up in a position with monsters to add back from your GY to your hand as they all shuffle themselves back into your deck when Fusing. As a result, I only run the 1 copy as it is very searchable and you'd rather not hit this with your mills early-on, but you could easily play more copies.  Extra Deck: <strong>3x Tearalaments Kitkalos</strong>- the main fusion of the deck, Kitkalos allows you to have a high degree of consistency while enabling large chains of effects. She is easily summoned, giving you the ability to search or send any of your Tearalaments cards at will from almost any position. Most commonly, you'll use Kitkalos' effect on herself to summon a Tearalaments Monster from hand/GY while triggering her effect to mill 5. While she can technically be recycled infinitely, I run 3 copies to ensure that I always have access to Kitkalos even if one gets banished or if you play a bit fast and loose with your Fusing, but you could just as easily run 2 copies if you find yourself wanting more room.  <strong>2x Tearalaments Kaleidoheart</strong>- the main boss of the deck. Kaleidoheart is a quick-effect shuffle into deck on summonÂ <em>and</em> whenever an Aqua Monster is sent to the GY by card effect, allowing you to easily spin cards on either player's turn. He also can special summon himself from the GY for free whenever he is sent there by a card effect, and mills a Tearalaments card in the process. This frequently comes in handy both for making him difficult to out and also allowing him to serve as an extender by milling a Tearalaments Monster for their Fusion effects, or by milling Salic/Metanoise for their GY effects. I run 2 copies as he is the biggest monster you can summon off of Tearalaments Monsters in order to push for damage, as well as to have one as a backup in case the first is banished, but you can technically recycle him off of the reborn effect of Kitkalos and could thus get away with only playing 1 if you so desire.  <strong>2x Predaplant Dragostapelia</strong>- one of your main forms of interaction, Dragostapelia can be made with surprising ease in this deck and gives you access to a simple negation effect on a soft once-per-turn. I play 2 as you can frequently make 2, and one can be recycled by fusing into a new copy using the one in your GY. Furthermore, the materials of Dragostapelia allow you to recycle any of your other Fusions, giving Tearalaments a strong grind game.  <strong>1x Lubellion the Searing Dragon</strong>- made using King of the Swamp as material, Lubellion allows you to put an additional body on the field while Fusing, or to recycle Monsters from your GY/Banished zone. Lubellion also satisfies the requirement to use the effect of Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon.  <strong> 1x Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong>- a strong non-targeting quick-effect banish that can be made using King of the Swamp and any Extra Deck monster, with an additional boardwipe effect if it gets removed. Mirrorjade can be a bit difficult to summon reliably due to its awkward material requirements, but its effects are certainly strong enough to make up for it.  <strong> 1x El Shaddoll Winda</strong>- made using a milled Shaddoll Beast, Winda gives you a devastating floodgate that can be extremely difficult for some decks to play around/out. Tearalaments play quite nicely around her effect as well, as you rarely need more than one Special Summon per turn after establishing a field and you can easily get rid of her by using her for a Fusion if need be.  <strong> 1x Time Wizard of Tomorrow</strong>- made using King of the Swamp in place of Time Wizard, Time Wizard of Tomorrow is a bit of a niche board clear typically used when trying to power through tough fields or as a last-ditch nuclear option. I don't often make it, and as such could easily be replaced by anything else should you desire to do so.  <strong> 1x Millennium-Eyes Restrict</strong>- made using King of the Swamp in place of Relinquished, Millennium-Eyes Restrict allows you to counter all manner of handtraps and disruptions while removing cards from your opponent's field/GY. As Millennium-Eyes Restrict isn't a hard once-per-turn, you could easily play and potentially summon more than 1 should you choose to run more.  <strong> 1x Number 39: Utopia / 1x Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</strong>- I run Utopia the Lightning as an Extra Deck out to get rid of things this deck otherwise has a hard time clearing. Untargetable/indestructible Monsters like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and unaffected Monsters like The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister can be a problem for this deck as nearly everything in this deck either targets or destroys, but luckily there are no restrictions anywhere on your effects that prevent you from running toolbox monsters in your Extra Deck to deal with said problems. While this is the option I currently run due to its low material investment, you could also play other removal options such as Borrelsword Dragon, Accesscode Talker (with a Link-3+ in your Extra Deck) or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, though they can be difficult to summon under fire.  <strong> 1x Time Thief Redoer</strong>- Redoer has an interesting place in this deck, as he is a relatively strong generic Xyz Monster that happens to detach his materials as part of his effect, rather than for cost. This means that Redoer can be used to trigger the effects of the Tearalaments Monsters you use to Summon him, those being the Fusion effect of Shaylen and the revive and subsequent mill effect of Rainoheart, and as a quick-effect no less.  The Side Deck in this list is currently comprised of some other options you could run. -Mare of the Shore is a decent normal summon who fulfills the same role as Rainoheart while also being an Aqua Monster for your Tearalaments Fusions. -Invoked Caliga is a powerful floodgate Fusion you can make using King of the Swamp in place of Aleister the Invoker. -Mudragon of the Swamp can technically be made in this deck to recycle any non-Aqua Dark Monster and give your Monsters targeting protection. -Knightmare Phoenix, Cerberus and Unicorn are decent generic Link Monsters that can be somewhat easily made, though their roles are covered by various Tearalaments cards anyway. -Super Polymerization can be used to great effect in this deck as it naturally plays a myriad of generic and semi-generic Fusion Monsters, and King of the Swamp can be Set to allow you to Fuse away any monster using Super Polymerization for something like Millennium-Eyes Restrict (who can be made using any Effect Monster). -Tearalaments Crime is the archetypal omni-negate Counter Trap, and while it is indeed a powerful effect, I found it to be too costly to be set up reliably. The GY effect isn't particularly useful either, and with no current in-archetype way of recovering milled spells/traps, I feel it best to ignore Tearalaments Crime for now. -Foolish Burial Goods can be used to send Tearalaments Salic/Metanoise to trigger their GY effects, allowing you to search or recover a Tearalaments Monster at will. However, I found it to be somewhat redundant as the deck already has many ways of doing this, not to mention that Foolish Burial Goods can be bricky and does nothing for you if milled. I would play at most 1-2 copies if you do decide to play it. -Foolish Burial falls into the many of the same problems as Foolish Burial Goods. It can potentially allow you to extend and mill a Tearalaments Monster to trigger their effects, but it felt redundant and unncesessary to me. -Reinforcement of the Army can be used to search Rainoheart as he happens to be a Warrior Type Monster, but I generally felt that the deck has enough ways of getting to him without it."

This deck aimed at being something of a hybrid strategy where fast-paced powerful attacks could be used or long-term burn damage can win the game. This deck is unoptimized, so some unnecessary and useless cards are included which could provide a benefit with some tweaking or removed for increased consistency.  11th deck made in a progression series after drawing 48 of every set through Ancient Sanctuary, but using post-errata cards and the April 2004 ban list."

The idea is to thin out the deck while at the very least, make a solid play. Also on your following turn, you can clear your monsters with dpe so you can get more twin plays through, I tried to fit the adventure token engine in here, but I feel the hand traps will be more useful. The hand trap line up is flexible, but I highly recommend gamma as it can be a really solid combo extender if you get ash'd early"

At this time:</strong>  <strong>- Germany and France sold weapons to Russia.</strong> <strong>This weapon is killing ukrainians now - check it out.</strong> <strong>- Germany was building more pipes and pumping billions of euros into Russia.</strong> <strong>The previous pipelines ran through Ukraine, which secured them a bit, as the safety of these pipelines was of interest to Russia.</strong>  <strong>What is happening now, while thousands of Ukrainians are killed, starved and is buried under the rubble:</strong>  <strong>- Germany, Â is against the real sanction. Germany introduces illusory sanctions on Russian banks.</strong> <strong>Sanctions on Russian banks except 2 largest Russian banks and the rest of the Russian banks make transactions through them.</strong> <strong>- The european union pays â¬ 800 million Russian for energy resources every day.</strong> <strong>Â Germany, France and Netherlands is against sanction on these raw materials.</strong>  <strong>I appeals to common sense, leaders of many countries, because I have no reason to appeal to their decency.</strong> <strong>An attack on another country or maybe blowing up a few nuclear power plants in Ukraine,</strong> <strong>or maybe some other step and we are one step away from an even greater tragedy.</strong>  <strong>Will you enjoy your fortune, luxury houses and yachts when the world turns into a nuclear deserts ?!</strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>Thank also to all users yugiohpro for understanding.</strong> <strong>I know that this message is not easy, but I also know that over 90% of my deck users are adult people</strong> <strong>(maybe each of us separately and together we can also change something).</strong>"

src=""https://ygoprodeck.com/pics_small/6853254.jpg"" alt=""Return of the Dragon Lords"" /></a> <blockquote><div>&nbsp;</div></blockquote> The reason why <strong>one for one</strong> is here is due to since we are playing lots brick we can discard them to summon out our lvl 1 tuners really easily to make needlefiber and also if you have any extenders like the legacy or reborn they can help you extend the combo even further.  The reason why I only play 2 <strong>return of the dragons lord</strong> because the third one really never comes up for me during my play testing.  The reason why I play<strong> dragon shrine</strong> is because of its secondary effect for example: sending blue-eyes+ stone of legend or eitherÂ  blue-eyes+ wyvern.  The reason why I play the <strong>eclipse wyvern </strong>and <strong>RedMD(Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon)</strong>Â is because your able to to send it off with the <strong>dragon shrine</strong> and with the<strong> galaxy eyes dark matter dragon.</strong> The main banish dragon monster off of Wyvern is the <strong>RedMD(Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon)</strong>. If you have like an extender like pisty you uses its effect to sp the redmd from the banish pile or having chaos dragon levianner in hand you can be able to banish the wyvern and any kind monster like the guardragons.  If your that type of person thats like a pure 40 deck. I would cut off RedMD,Wyvern,Dragon Shrine. And everything would be the same still.  &nbsp;"

Heroes deck focused on generating hand advantage and summoning a variety of Extra Deck monsters to break through opposing boards for an O,"Mostly pure Elemental Heroes focused deck. Aim to go second, hopefully opening with a hand trap or two to disrupt the worst of your opponent's setup, then go for an OTK on your turn. The monster effects of the combination of Liquid Soldier, Shadow Mist, Blazeman, and Stratos let you summon a variety of fusion monsters while still maintaining hand advantage. The deck provides a solid toolbox for getting around most forms of protection. Captain Gold can be discarded by its own effect, providing material for Miracle Fusion, and Skyscraper is either an easy discard candidate itself (for something like Liquid Soldier's draw effect) or can allow you to win combat if you're locked out of the Extra Deck. The best choices for Shadow Mist's search are either Stratos, or Honest Neos. Stratos is best for when you fuse Shadow Mist and Liquid Soldier together, structure the chain so that you search Stratos first, then discard Stratos for Liquid Soldier's effect. Then, you can either use Stratos to summon E. Hero Tornado with Miracle Fusion, or special summon it with Liquid Soldier on a later turn to destroy at least one spell/trap on the opponent's field and then follow up with a Rank 4 Xyz or a Link-2 as an extending play. Remember that the hand traps like Ash Blossom, Ghost Mourner, and Effect Veiler can also be used as fusion materials in a pinch as well.  If you have to go first, or you're unable to OTK this turn, the deck has just a few options for closers. Masked Hero Dark Law shuts down many meta strategies by itself. A combination of Absolute Zero plus a set Mask Change allows you to activate a one-sided board wipe at any time, and is generally easier to setup than transforming Honor Ark into Zeus for a similar effect. Rivalry of Warlords is also a useful stun tool since a majority of the Deck are Warrior type monsters.  The Side Deck contains two alternative strategies. One is a Vision Hero package that allows for more swarming ability for maintaining card advantage on the field. You can substitute in the extra Rank 4 Xyz monsters for additional removal tools. The other strategy is a discount Kaiju strategy revolving around Super Polymerization to remove threats from your opponent's field when they are capable of putting up multiple layers of protection for their boss monsters. Adjust the Side Deck to fit your target meta. The Main Deck is already balanced around the Master Duel meta and performs well up into Gold Rank.  Consider substituting out Blazeman and the regular Polymerizations for the Vision Hero package (replace one Emergency Call with Reinforcement of the Army), and substitute out some of the fusion monsters in the Extra Deck for more generic Xyz and Link monsters. This will reduce the likelihood of bricking on a handful of fusion spells, and provide even more flexibility against other stun or control decks."

In the end, I can see that using three was beneficial because of siding these cards off for my techs on the side deck.Â </span>  <span>Now every other card is just the same strategy that everyone hates about altergeist: Say No to everything that the opponent does.Â </span>  <span>The Highlights that I am going to do is:</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>â<a data-name=""The Warning Pointâ"">The Warning Pointâ</a>, This trap took a lot of my opponent off guard, because it shut down effects and cannot be used for anything until the next turn.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Using <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> instead of <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>, Card advantage is everything on this deck, even more than get a combo piece. This card helped me a lot.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>More <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> than <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, a lot of monsters that summon themselves by effects. That 's the reason.Â </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Waking the dragon and the â Trio Parada duraâ, just a spice for the second game.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> is a beautiful card.Â </span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Finally, I can guarantee that (even though I did not do well in the local tournament), I did not make any friends. This deck is only for your amusement. </span>"

You are welcome to change those monsters in any way you like if you have a better idea. I advise you to play a few games with this deck and I'm sure you will have a great time with it, surely even reach plat with it. I assure you it is a very strong deck in Master Duel and probably the best variation of it. Worth mentioning that it can be beaten only by Shadoll deck, Herald of Ultimateness deck and you carelessness :)  Good luck and have fun!"

He makes the end board I respect most in current yugioh: <strong>distributed interactions</strong> whether field monster effect, spell/trap and hand traps. This type of combo is <strong>much better than decks that go to a table full of negates and lose to blind second cards</strong>. That's why I consider this a deck with immense potential for excellence in distributing interactions and this will be clear to everyone when <a data-name=""Mathmech Circular"">Mathmech Circular</a> support is released, which in my initial tests <strong>solves all of the deck's shortcomings</strong>. I tested Mathmech a lot in the current Tcg format and the deck performed very well, even with the powercreep of Token and DPE engines. This is due to a lot to understand that even with a lot of 1 Card Combo absurdities in the format the use of a lot of <strong>hand trap is still the best way to face everything unfair in the game</strong>, even if it doesn't completely stop the opponent it sure makes your end board breakable. With that in mind, I'll show you what I learned about the Mathmech archetype:  - Like every Cyberse deck it has a tight Extra Deck but it <strong>makes one of the best end boards among Cyberse decks in terms of interactions</strong> since <a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a> is an absurd card that is <strong>guaranteed at least -3 to the opponent</strong> since when it enters field it has an effect similar to <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> sending a card from the hand, a monster and a spell/trap to the GY in addition to the <strong>Omni Negate that gains</strong> from the <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> to deal with another card. - And if the hand is very good, you will have the interaction of <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> who turns <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> to deal with another opponent's card, not to mention the interactions in the form of <strong>hand traps and the OTK facility of Mathmech</strong>. - The deck ceiling is not very high so you have to make the most of every interaction you do which requires a lot of training and knowledge of competitive matchups.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //////////////////////////<strong>Combos</strong>: So as you can see your turn 1 has the objective of setting up <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> by making <a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a> on the opponent's turn using <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> as material to have an Omni Negate as well. For this you use an engine that became popular recently in the so-called ""<strong>Eldlich Cyberse</strong>"" but which has always been used in Mathmech: <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> + <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a>. Here you use this engine exclusively to access combos involving <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> which is a card that is only missing by ""Mathmech"" in the name because it <strong>connects several parts of the engine by adding one of its 3 Tuners</strong> from the deck to the hand: <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a>, <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> or <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a>. And to complement the archetype we have two <strong>great generic Cyberse support</strong> options in the Main Deck: <a data-name=""Balancer Lord"">Balancer Lord</a> and <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>. These cards make the deck's consistency much better as they <strong>increase the amount of 2 combo cards possible</strong> and even help when you need to build a field going second while dealing with opponent interactions. Finally, I demonstrate this whole theory below:  /////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Balancer Lord + Diameter</strong>  NS Balancer Lord and eff pay1000LP and Link Disciple NS Diameter and eff Reborn Balancer Lord and RANK-4 Alembertian and eff Add Superfactorial *Alembertian eff tribute itself Reborn Diameter and Link Devotee and Mandatory eff *(if you have any extenders in your hand like Subtraction/Addition you don't need to tax the Alembertian and he stays on the field as a negate of Nibiru if the opponent has it)  Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter Hand adn Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Wicckid and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Wicckid eff banish Balancer Lord Add Nabla Balancer Lord eff Special Nabla and Nabla eff tribute Linguriboh SS Sigma from Deck LINK-2 I:P Masquerena and Set Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wickid + I:P Masquerena + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Sigma  /////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Sigma + Subtraction/Addition</strong>  Sigma eff SS from Hand and Subtraction/Addition eff SS from Hand Link Disciple and Link Devotee and Mandatory eff and Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter Hand adn Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Wicckid and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Wicckid eff banish Devotee Add Nabla NS Nabla and eff tribute Linguriboh SS Diameter from Deck RANK-4 Alembertian and eff Add Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wicckid + Alembertian + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Subtraction/Addition  /////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Subtraction + Parallel eXceed (basically any Normal Summon from the deck + eXceed)</strong>  NS Subtraction and Link Disciple and eXceed eff Link Devotee and Mandatory eff and Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter hand and Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Splash Mage and eff Reborn Subtraction and LINK-2 Wicckid RANK-4 Alembertian and eff cl1 Add Superfactorial and Wicckid eff cl2 Add Nabla and Alembertian eff tribute itself SS Nabla and eff tribute SS Diameter from Deck and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Set Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wicckid + Linguriboh + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Subtraction  ///////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Balancer Lord + Sigma (basically any other Mathmech Monster other than Diameter + Balancer Lord)</strong>  NS Balancer Lord and eff pay1000LP and NS Sigma Link Disciple and Link Devotee and Mandatory eff and Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter Hand adn Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Wicckid and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Wicckid eff banish Balancer Lord Add Nabla Balancer Lord eff Special Nabla and Nabla eff tribute Linguriboh SS Diameter from Deck RANK-4 Alembertian and eff Add Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wicckid + Alembertian + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Sigma  /////////////////////////////////////////////////  Put the continuation of the link on the <strong>duelingbook</strong> website after <strong>.com/</strong>  replay?id=813757-38220625 Test Hands Before Support Mathmech TCG Apr22 - In general you will always be able to setup <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> + <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> but sometimes you <strong>won't have 3 Mathmech Monsters in the GY</strong> for Superfactorial because the hand didn't come out good, but otherwise the test hands presented help you a lot to understand how to use Mathmech.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Technoplay:</strong>  <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> omni negate allows you to be <strong>guaranteed access to</strong> <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> when using <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> eff because you <strong>negate the Hand Trap</strong> he chained to his effect. That's why you <strong>always try to make</strong> <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> on your 1st turn using <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> as material. And on the opponent's turn the <strong>Diameter omni negate</strong> given to the <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> has to be used with caution given the hand traps you have in your hand, sometimes <strong>you can spare the hand trap</strong> like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> if it is clear that negating with <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> the opponent already there will be no more ways to continue playing.  In the case of starting with a <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> draw, many of the combos can be done in order <strong>to guarantee having 3 Mathmech Monster in the GY</strong> including the <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> over 5 summons, avoiding instantly finding yourself in a <strong>bad position in the game if you take Nibiru</strong>. For this <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> is essential to access the third name of Mathmech in the first summons. Even if you take <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> or any other card that takes one of the 3 targets from the GY's with <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> eff, you can Summon the other 2 Mathmech Monsters and RANK-4 <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> in place of Laplacian.  <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> is one of the best hand traps against this deck because <strong>currently the hands played around it require 3-card combos</strong>. In other cases you are <strong>very dependent on the search</strong> effect of <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> passing to continue your plays which makes the <strong>deck not very resilient</strong> to common hand traps of the format. But I say that for sure these <strong>shortcomings will put an end to Mathmech Circular in the game</strong>.  <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> is your biggest blind second card nightmare when playing Mathmech so in cases of passing with <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> and <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> interaction always use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> interaction <strong>first even if you have to use Wicckid</strong> to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> and miss its Follow Up.  All Special Summoned Main Deck Mathmech Monsters <strong>have restrictions</strong> - <a data-name=""Mathmech Addition"">Mathmech Addition</a>, <a data-name=""Mathmech Subtraction"">Mathmech Subtraction</a>, <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a>: - Everyone restricts you from <strong>Special Summoning Cyberse monsters from the Extra Deck</strong>. - <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> will be <strong>banned when leaving the field</strong> unless used as an Xyz Material. - <a data-name=""Addition"">Addition</a> and <a data-name=""Subtraction"">Subtraction</a> <strong>can't attack for the rest of the turn</strong> and that's why I always Special Summon them in <strong>Defense Position</strong> as they won't be able to attack anyway. - <a data-name=""Mathmech Addition"">Mathmech Addition</a> and <a data-name=""Mathmech Subtraction"">Mathmech Subtraction</a> are even better <strong>going second</strong> as they can <strong>target opponent's monsters</strong> without you having to spend your Normal Summon early. And there's still the detail that the monster they target <strong>doesn't need to lose or gain 1000atk</strong> for them to be Special Summoned.  <strong>Additional Effects</strong> You Should Consider: <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> allows a monster made in the Extra Monster Zone to <strong>attack Monsters twice</strong> during the Battle Phase. <a data-name=""Mathmech Multiplication"">Mathmech Multiplication</a> <strong>doubles the atk</strong> of a monster you control in the Extra Monster Zone which synergizes very well with <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> for <strong>inflicting double battle damage</strong> on the opponent so you pretty much OTK attack any opponent's <strong>monster that has 2k atk or less</strong>. which is easy since Subtraction can decrease ATK by 1000. And finally, we have the detail that <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> can be <strong>used as a non-tuner for a Synchro</strong> Summon of Mathmech monsters.  <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> has a <strong>Mandatory effect</strong> that is not once per turn when it is Link Summoned from you <strong>lock in doing only LINK-2 or less</strong>. I use two Link Devotees in this format because the Token engine made <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre"">Ghost Ogre</a> popular again which means if I'm facing a player who knows how to correctly use Ghost Ogre against Mathmech he <strong>will use the mandatory Link Devotee effect</strong> then the second copy is needed to allow you to combo <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> if you take Ghost Ogre.  Against trap decks, don't think twice about <strong>starting your turn by doing</strong> <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> in scare to avoid losing to floodgates.  <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> is the only <strong>way to follow up on Mathmech's deck</strong> because even on the opponent's turn you can <strong>trigger search eff</strong> by Special Summoning a monster in the zone he points to using <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> eff or <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a>. It <strong>protects your monsters from being destroyed by card effects</strong> so makes your end board even better against blind second cards like <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>.  Many times you will make <strong>more Link Monsters</strong> which at first point of view are unnecessary summons but <strong>in the end give you more pops</strong> to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. For example in <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> + 2 <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> you can do: Linguriboh then <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> reborn from GY and do <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> and do <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> bringing I:P Masquerena back and finally <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a>.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Important interactions to know against metagame decks:</strong>  When you have to take <a data-name=""Mirrorjade"">Mirrorjade</a> out of the field with <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> <strong>without protection</strong> from <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> then the best thing is to use Accesscode eff <strong>banish itself to destroy Mirrorjade</strong> just to prevent the opponent from being able to Reborn Accesscode with <a data-name=""Dark Charmer"">Dark Charmer</a>. Speaking of <a data-name=""Dark Charmer"">Dark Charmer</a>, this card is so good that I almost <strong>always banish I:P Masquerena as Wicckid's activation cost</strong> when I do <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> to prevent him from giving Reborn.  Chain <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> not on <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>Â <strong>activation but on</strong> <a data-name=""Lubellion"">Lubellion</a>Â effect because you take <a data-name=""Mirrorjade"">Mirrorjade</a> off the field and already <strong>forces it to use the effect of banishing a monster</strong> from the field as soon as it enters.  <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> vs <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> Unlike cards like <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Revolt"">Tri-Brigade Revolt</a>, even if you use <strong>Superfactorial as cl2 to the opponent's DPE effect</strong>, what will happen is to bring the <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> to the field and even if it's not in the zone that <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> points out, there's no problem because you <strong>protect him of destruction with its own continuous effect</strong> so you are always <strong>guaranteed that its effect when it is Xyz Summoned</strong> will activate and take up to two cards from the opponent in this case in addition to having the <strong>Diameter Omni Negate</strong> to negate the effect of the Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer on the GY.  <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> is absurd against <a data-name=""Floowandereeze"">Floowandereeze</a>, it only has <strong>Continuous Spell</strong> <a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds"">Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds</a> out or Tribute Summon <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and if you leave any of the <strong>small birds on the field</strong> like <a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Robina"">Floowandereeze &amp; Robina</a> it automatically <strong>increases the chance of losing the game</strong> with an ATK.  Another cool thing about <strong>Mathmech versus Floowandereeze</strong> is that even with <a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Empen</a> on the field you <strong>have ways to clear his field</strong> thanks to <a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a> so always try to see plays of <strong>making Laplacian to force his interactions</strong>.  Make <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> under <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> = Always remember that on the field effects denied <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> <strong>returns to 2000atk/def and is level 8</strong> so you can for example make <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> and <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> eff and use eXceed and <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a>/<a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a>/<a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> to make <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> and go to Beat Down and buy time until you have out for <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> not to mention that if Final Sigma leaves the field you <strong>add a Mathmech card</strong> to your hand as <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a>. Another tip for dealing with <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> is to use <a data-name=""Subtraction"">Subtraction</a> and <a data-name=""Addition"">Addition</a> effects to decrease the ATK of an opponent's monster or increase your monsters ATK and take it out in battle as <a data-name=""Golden Lord"">Golden Lord</a> etc since they are effects that activate in the hand and are <strong>not affected by Skill Drain</strong>. But of course the only out in monster form for Skill Drain after being activated is <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> banishing itself from the field as a cost. <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> vs <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>: If <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> <strong>was already activated before</strong> <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> entered the field, it comes with the <strong>effects negated</strong> so it's no use doing it in the Extra Monster Zone, but if Final Sigma was on the field in the Extra Monster Zone <strong>before of Skill Drain is activated</strong> then it will <strong>continue to be Unaffected</strong> by Card Effects.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Missplays you must avitate to win games:</strong>  Analyze if the Combo you are going to make <strong>loses to a hand trap</strong> because if so it is better to use <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> at the <strong>beginning of the combo to see if the hand becomes more resilient</strong> to interactions.  Trying to keep <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> in the GY when his combo is weak for an interaction with <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> and couldn't do <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> which made his end board much worse.  You should <strong>analyze what to return to the deck after Link Disciple's draw</strong> because if it's any monster in the deck that <strong>can extend its plays after interactions</strong> when your combo is fragile to hand traps <strong>if you return the monster to the deck it could mean losing to</strong> an <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>/<a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> in <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> eff.  Do not play around <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> on your <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> + <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> End Board when you <strong>knew the opponent used that card</strong> in the Main Deck. It's better not to have <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>Â interaction than to lose almost all of your field to a <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>.

This deck uses a combination of Stratos and Shadow mist's searching abilities in combination with the Vision HERO summoning engine to consistently build a board of monsters capable of OTKing. There is a bit of a learning curve however, the combos are situational and you need to adapt to your available cards. Expect to get pushed around a little as you learn the strategy and logic of this deck, but once mastered you'll be dunking on opponents in style.  Generally with this deck you want to go second. The deck doesn't have many options to defend itself aside from forbidden droplet and ash blossom, so going second allows you to generate your full field and immediately go for the kill instead of hoping your board survives the opponent's turn. Typically if you do go first the goal is to get Dark law or Plasma on the field as having those cards on the field can really disrupt your opponent, and almost guarantee a win if they can't clear them. This deck does not like extended duels and uses most of its resources in a large wombo combo. Generally speaking if after turn two you haven't done enough damage to cripple their game plan/win, most competent decks will out scale HEROs later into the duel.  Stratos/Shadow mist: Most of your searching power comes from these two cards, Getting their effects off successfully generally allows you to start your major combos. Shadow mist is an excellent target for effects like Vyon, Faris, Increase, and foolish burial, netting you a free hero search. Stratos can be used to clear spell/traps in a pinch.  Faris(Vision engine): Getting Faris to your hand allows you to kickstart your bnb, his discard effect can be used to get cards like malicious and shadow mist out of your hand(where they don't do much) into the graveyard. Then allows you to special summonÂ  itself, and send Increase to your spell/trap zones. Tributing Faris(or a different monster) with Increase allows you to get an extra summon of Vyon who lets you discard from the deck. This one combo gets you two monsters on the field and allows you to discard from your hand and deck which is pretty nice.  Vyon: Has an effect that lets you send a card from the deck to the graveyard, and search for polymerization. Because of the amount of monsters the vision engine usually lets you summon, it's very easy to get Trinity on the field with Vyon.  Malicious: Malicious is another excellent target for cards you want to send to the grave, his effect allows you to special summon himself from the main deck by banishing himself from the grave. A free summon that can be used for links and combos very nicely with cards like fusion destiny, and Xtra HERO Cross Crusader. Worth noting that if you use Malicious to link summon Cross, you can bring him back using Cross' effect then link into Dread Decimator. Giving you a relatively cheap way to bring out one of your ideal OTK beat sticks.  Adusted Gold: Straightforward combo here. Discard Gold to get dark calling, use dark calling to fuse him from the grave with Dynatag or Malicious to get Malicious Edge, a board clearing 3k beat stick that generally ends most duels.  Liquid: Liquid soldier's effect allows you to draw 2 discard 1 if you use him in a fusion summon. Needless to say this is very helpful, and Absolute Zero (who is the typical target to fuse liquid into) can be mask changed into Acid for a full board wipe combo.  Mask Change: Mask change gives you access to some nice utility effects and is one of the more vital spells in the deck. Defensively you can use it to save a hero from being destroyed via card effect by using it to summon a masked hero before it's destroyed. Offensively it can be used during the battle phase on a monster that's already attacked to net you an extra attack thats between 2200-2800 dmg. In addition to that Blast and Acid have some helpful effects like clearing spells/traps and lowering attack points of opponent monsters. Not to mention Dark Law has one of the best effects in the game, neutering decks that rely on the graveyard and banishing cards from your opponents hand. Some decks will FF immediately once they see Dark law on the field, he's that good."

Forget expensive staples/techs and control the battlefield with powerful Gladiator Beast Fusions ,"Unleash the beast with Gladiator Beasts on a budget! The aim of the game is summoning Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor, and there are multiple ways to do this.  [Before talking strategy, I'd like to get this out of the way first: This is by no means an optimal build, missing most pricey staples/techs currently available in the modern TCG. Funny enough, after not having played the TCG for maybe a decade, I had finally gotten around to selling my entire collection (except for my GBs and a few staples for nostalgia's sake) last year, but the successful marketing campaign that is Master Duel (and my success in Platinum Ranked using GBs with their new support) rekindled the heart of the cards in me. However, I was not looking to start throwing large sums of money at the TCG,Â  Therefore, no single card in the deck is valued above $6, and almost 80% of all cards used are below $2.]  Disclaimer now out of the way, let's talk about Tamer Editor. This fantastic fusion monster, requiring 2 LV5+ GBs, has a *soft* 1/turn effect to summon any GB fusion monster from the ED, allowing you to quickly stack your field with big bodies that can either pop or negate your opponent's cards. The particularly helpful part of this effect is being able to summon Dominitianus and Heraklinos without the need for 3 GBs. In fact, the deck doesn't even run Vespasius or Laquari, the GBs normally needed to summon them, freeing up space in the deck for more cards that add support or consistency to achieving our main goal of summoning Tamer Editor.  You'll normally summon Tamer Editor with Augustus (field) + Augustus/Noxious/Attorix, but Augustus + Attorix is by far the easiest way, Attorix being searchable with Test Panther (2), Tenki (1), Proving Ground (3), and Rejection (3). The Tamer Editor flowchart normally starts with a field consisting of Test Panther and any GB (except for Augustus), and x1 Augustus/Noxious/Attorix in hand, though it can be done without Panther if you draw into Test Tiger.  STEP 1 The many ways to summon Test Panther + 1 GB: - Rescue Cat/Rabbit: Summon Samnite+TestTiger or x2 Andal, link into Test Panther, Panther searches GB Comeback to summon any non-Beast GB from hand or GY (non-Beast because Comeback can only summon a GB of a type not already face-up on your field, and Panther is a Beast, so make sure if you use Samnite that you have a different GB in hand). - Rescue Cat + Rescue Rabbit: SUMMON CAT FIRST, summon Ferrijit with Samnite+TT, Ferrijit summons Rabbit into Andal x2, 1st Andal+Ferrijit summons Test Panther alongside the 2nd Andal. - Andal x2 (inhand): 1st Andal links into Link Spider, Spider summons 2nd Andal from hand, link to Test Panther, search Comeback to revive Andal. - Unexpected Dai + Andal (in hand): Achieves the previous option before even normal summoning, allowing you to normal summon a GB alongside your Panther and save Comeback for a follow-up play, or search GB Charge/WarChariot/United for defense, or search Augustus/Noxious/Attorix if you don't have a LV5+ GB in hand (normally you'll want either Noxious/Attorix, but Augustus in hand can extend plays even further if you have Darius/Equeste/Bestiari in hand). - Mind Control + 1 GB: Steals an opponent's monster to use alongside 1 GB to summon Test Panther, since Panther is a Link2 requiring min. 1 GB. Panther searches Comeback, revives your GB. - Gladiator Rejection + RescueCat/RescueRabbit/UnexpectedDai/TestTiger+1GB: Free summon of an additional GB from deck whose type isn't face-up on your field when resolving when a GB is summoned from deck, and the main deck contains 11 cards that facilitate this alongside Rejection, in additional to GB tag-in/out effects (but the aim is to be able to summon Tamer Editor BEFORE the battle phase whenever possible). - Any 2 GB + Comeback: Summon 1st GB, Comeback summons 2nd GB, link into Panther, searches 2nd Comeback to revive either GB.  STEP 2 Use Panther + 1 GB on field and Augustus/Noxious/Attorix in hand to summon Tamer Editor: - Attorix/Tenki/ProvingGround: Draw or search Atttorix, Panther tags out the GB on field to summon Augustus from deck, summoning Attorix from hand, Attorix sends Augustus/Noxious from deck to GY to gain their LV, fuse Augustus+Attorix into Tamer Editor. - Noxious: Panther tags out the GB on field to summon Augustus from deck, summoning Noxious from hand, Noxious sends Bestiari from deck to GY (for follow-up Gyzarus plays using Darius/GBUnited), fuse Augustus+Noxious into Tamer Editor. - Augustus: Panther tags out the GB on field to summon Augustus from deck, summoning a 2nd Augustus from hand, fuse Augustus+Augustus into Tamer Editor. If you have another GB in hand, you can use the 2nd Augustus to summon it, potentially extending your combo (Darius to revive a GB, Equeste to recover Comeback, Bestiari to pop a S/T and/or fuse into Gyzarus for more pops). - Test Panther: Searches Augustus/Noxious/Attorix if you don't have it in hand by drawing or other means and already have Panther + 1 GB on field without the need to search Comeback.  STEP 3 Use Tamer Editor's effect: - Summon Domitianus: This is almost always your #1 pick. Soft 1/turn monster effect negate+destroy, PLUS you choose your opponent's attack targets on their Battle Phase, a useful effect used to protect your weaker cards like Panther. So many players DON'T READ this part of Domi's effects, leading them to accidentally attacking into your heavy hitters instead. #imagineduelistsactuallyreadingcardeffects - Summon Heraklinos: Can discard 1 to negate+destroy any S/T. Only summon with min. 1 card in hand. Remember that Darius/Equeste can help recycle your discarded GB cards (Remember that Equeste CANNOT recover Proving Ground or Rejection). Great for protecting your monsters from stuff like Raigeki / Lightning Storm or backrow-heavy decks in general. - Summon Gyzarus: A free pop 2 anywhere on the field. Great for dealing with high ATK targets, or pesky backrow.  Congrats! You now likely have a field of Test Panther, Tamer Editor and Domitianus. But why stop there? If you managed to conserve your GB Comeback, Link Tamer Editor and Test Panther into any Link 2 or 3, revive Tamer Editor with Comeback and activate its effect again, summoning either a 2nd Domi for more effect negation, Heraklinos to also gain protection from S/T, or Gyzarus to pop and clear the way to victory. Domitianus (3500) + Tamer Editor (2400) + Gyzarus (2400) = 8300 damage. That's lethal without even taking into account the ATK power of the Link Monster.  STEP 4 (optional) Link summon using Tamer Editor + Test Panther, revive Tamer Editor with Comeback to use its effect a 2nd time on the same turn: - Knightmare Unicorn: Your only way of non-destruction removal in the deck besides Tri-Brigade Shuraig. Alongside Gyzarus summoned by your revived Tamer Editor, you can remove up to 3 obstacles in your way before the Battle Phase. Up to 4, technically, since you can further Link Summon with Tamer Editor + Unicorn into Shuraig for a 1/turn non-targetting banish. Borrelsword Dragon is also a viable candidate for running over opposing heavy hitters. - Cross-Sheep/Ferrijit: These let you summon an extra monster from hand (Ferrijit) or GY (Cross-Sheep). If using Cross-Sheep, make sure you can summon Tamer Editor from GY to a zone Cross-Sheep points to to get its effect off. From here, you can further Link Summon with Tamer Editor + CrossSheep/Ferrijit + the extra monster into either Tri-Brigade Shuraig or Borrelsword Dragon. Borrelsword is usually for Turn 1 plays, to add an additional layer of defense to your field. Summoning Shuraig Turn 1 is not recommended, as you may lose it before ever getting to use its removal effect.  Notes on other main deck cards: - Gladiator Beast United: This searchable quickplay spell requires a bit of set-up, but is a great way to disrupt your opponent's plays on their turn. With Bestiari in hand, field or GY (usually put in GY by Noxious) and any other 1 GB in hand, field or GY, you can summon Gyzarus and pop 2. If you already have Bestiari + 1 GB + United on Turn 2 going 2nd, you can simply enter BP and summon Gyzarus to clear your opponent's field and attack, tagging out into setting up your Tamer Editor combo in MP2. - Gladiator Beast Charge: Effectively Gyzarus in searchable trap form. Lets you pop up to 1/GB with different names face-up on your field. - Gladiator Beast War Chariot: Searchable monster effect negation, for when Domitianus isn't enough. - Effect Veiler: Probably one of the best cheap hand traps. Interchangeable with Kaijus or other available had traps like Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit. However, Veiler (and other monster HTs like Ghost Ogre) has the added bonus of being able to normal summon it alongside a special summoned GB to go into Test Panther if necessary.  Side Deck: - Skull Meister and GB Retiari: For GY-heavy decks. - Gameciel: The Kaiju of choice, being the only one Tamer Editor and Gyzarus can run over. - Dimensional Barrier: For shutting down decks that focus heavily on ED monsters, especially those that use mostly a single type. - Royal Decree: For those nasty trap-heavy decks and Skill Drain. The deck doesn't really suffer by removing its 2 GB traps. - GB Charge: For decks that use a lot of continuous S/T, and an alternative out to Skill Drain. Looking at you, Eldlich players.  Other decent+cheap side deck options: - Twister / Twin Twister: For more S/T removal. Twister only works for face-up S/T but doesn't require a discard. You want your hand for Heraklinos and Unicorn, but remember you can recycle with Equeste. - Ghost Belle &amp; Snow Rabbit: Generic hand-trap destruction effect. Potential alternative to Veiler. - Dark Ruler No More: Another out to problematic monsters that are indestructible or have negation effects. Potential alternative to Gameciel.  Fun fact about GBs and Skill Drain interractions: - You can still tag in/out a GB under Skill Drain, because returning to deck is the cost, but the summoned GB will obviously not get its effect.  Main deck card options for those with a bigger budget or who already have some modern staples/techs: - Evenly Matched:Â  I love using this card in Master Duel with GBs. Summon a GB, attack, tag out (returns GB to deck as cost), chain link 2 Evenly Match, wipe your opponent's field, tag in to new GB. Fun fact about GB Comeback, the monster summoned by it is indestructible by battle, which is helpful if you have EM and a GB that can't attack over anything on your opponent's field. - Accesscode Talker: Another great finisher with high attack and a removal effect. Would probably replace Shuraig or Borrelsword (should probably keep for Turn 1 plays) with it. - Obviously stuff like Ash Blossom, Nibiru, Crossout, Droplets, Impermanence, etc.  Final Notes: This deck is a lot of fun and surprisingly consistent. Great for casual play with friends, or catching players off-guard at locals, but likely not big-tournament viable. Still, a great option for nostalgic players returning to the game on a budget."

Ideally you end on a Naturia Beast + Joyous Melffys with a Kalantosa under it, giving you unlimited spell negates and a pop + another card, ideally Puppy or Wallaby, and you also then have the potential to go Sealy + 2* into Cheerful or Herald, or Sealy + 4* into Desert Locusts, ripping a card, then Locusts +4* into Leo for a big dude to sit on. Joyous Melffys is here if you don't have anything else turn 1, Mommy can do some fun stuff with 5 materials but really is cope, Crumble Logos can get something annoying out of the way, Barkion and Landoise for specific matchups where trap or monster negates are more useful, Dawn Dragster for a negate to summon on your opponent's turn with Sealy, since Naturia Beast requires an Earth tuner, Cross-Sheep to play around Knightmare Gryphon, although that's really just my casual environment talking, and Saryuja for additional summons and to make use of a swarmed board.  In the side I just threw a bunch of random stuff without much thought, but there's the other two Alphas for going second, 3 Lost Wind for more negates, 1 Obelisk because it's hilarious, a Knightmare package just for fun, 3 Drowning just because, and a little Fabled package because Unicore is kinda nice, and Cerburrel isn't terrible."

This can get you to Plat in master duel, but can't compete with Meta decks.","This is a very strong turn 2 deck to try and OTK. Most cases you can't, but for the most part you'll have a huge advantage in turn 2 since you'll be able to attack with a 5.2k beater that only grows stronger if it kills a monster.  You can <ul>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> <ul>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Curse of Dragon</strong> from hand or GY, <ul>  	<li>Pick up <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> (this can get Ash blossomed)Â and fusion summon Gaia Magical Knight of Dragons</li>  	<li>Or pick up <strong>Galloping Gaia</strong> (usually if you already have Spiral fusion in your hand)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Artillery Catapult Turtle</strong> <ul>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> from the deck (this can get Ash blossomed) <ul>  	<li>Then follow through first steps.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Curse of Dragon</strong> <ul>  	<li>Then pick up either <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> if you can use it, or get <strong>Galloping Gaia</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> With Spiral Fusion, your fusion Gaia gains 2600 ATK, and is allowed to attack twice on monsters.  <strong>Gaia Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> is the safest, and strongest card you can play on turn one as it can decrease its ATK by 2600 to destroy one card on the field once per any turn, but <strong>NOT</strong> negate. This card is the go to for fusion summoning cause of its effect to gain 2600 ATK after killing a monster in battle, once per battle phase. Becomes ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" on the field.  <strong>Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion</strong> is situational as he can force the monster he's attacking to attack or defense position. His summon searches <em>Spiral Spear Strike</em> from the deck or GY, which allows ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" pierce dmg on defense position monsters. It allows you to draw 2, discard 1, if you are able to destroy the monster. Becomes ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" on the field. (You can Fusion summon this card using <strong>Keeper of Dragon Magic</strong> as material)  <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</strong>, is a super situational card. Once fusion summoned, you can fusion summon a level 7 dragon fusion monster using materials in the GY, and pull out Spiral Fusion out of your GY to fusion summon any of the fusion Gaia's above.  <strong>Soldier Gaia the Fierce Knight</strong> quick effect is to tribute a fusion dragon monster to summon this dude. This effect can be used in battle phase and can attack as well when summoned, so attack after the monster has attacked.  When Fusion summoning with Curse of Dragon, it can activate another effect by targeting your ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" and negating all your opponents face up monsters effects with ATK less than or equal to that Gaia.  <strong>IF an open board, no cards on opponent side, 8k LP</strong> <ol>  	<li>Fusion summon Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</li>  	<li>Fusion summon any ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" cards</li>  	<li>Go to ""Battle Phase""</li>  	<li>Attack on each monster, then use Soldier Gaia the Fierce Knight quick effect to summon himself using Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</li>  	<li><strong>DON'TÂ </strong>use his effect once summoned.</li>  	<li>The DMG should come out to 2k + 5.2k + 2.6k = 9.2k</li> </ol> You usually don't have to worry about traps in the battle phase because of Galloping Gaia's effect, if you have any ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" fusion cards on the field.  When using <strong>Galloping Gaia</strong>, you want to pick up <strong>Curse of Dragon</strong>, or <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong>. These two cards are the engine of this deck.  You can fusion summon with any of the Gaia the Fierce Knight, and ANY level 5 dragon monster. <strong>Mahaama dragon</strong> is in this deck incase you have absolutely nothing and can help stall a bit.  IF <strong>Gaia the Fierce Knight Origins</strong> is in the GY, you can change one monster's ATK to the original value. You DON'T use this on your Gaia's unless you happen to have your <strong>Gaia Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> ATK to be at Zero for some reason.  <em>Spiral Spear Strike</em>. This is a dead card in most cases on your starting hand. You only want this if the enemy has a defense monster. *It's okay to throw this card away since <strong>Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon ChampionÂ </strong>can pick it up from the GY or deck.  &nbsp;  Feel free to add more to the extra deck. This was just basically a pure Gaia fusion deck and it's fun seeing a 5.2k beater on the board destroying monsters on the field."

But that doesn't mean we don't want it-","<strong>Bread and Butter Combos:</strong>  Delta The Magnet Warrior + Magnetic Field + Magnet Induction  Activate Magnetic Field, leave your opponent in a state of chronic shock as they realize they're playing against Magnet Warriors, then Normal Summon Delta. Use Delta The Magnet Warrior's effect to send Beta The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck to Grave, then activate Magnet Induction to Special Summon Epsilon The Magnet Warrior from Deck. Use Epsilon's effect to trade out the Beta The Electromagnet Warrior in grave by milling a Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck, then add Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck to hand with Beta. Use Magnetic Field to bring back Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior from grave to Special Summon Alpha from hand, and add a Level 8 Magna Warrior (preferably Berserkion since you can summon Valkyrion from Deck). If going first, make Gallant Granite and Gorgonic Guardian. Use Gallant Granite to search Adamancipator Researcher to get another body on board, then use Adamanciaptor Researcher and the remaining Level 3 to make a Naturia Beast. If going second, make Gallant Granite (or Number 101: Silent Honor ARK) and The Phantom Knights of Break Sword and use Gallant to add an Adamancipator Researcher OR another Magna Warrior. It doesn't take much thought to go on from there.  (You can tell from this upcoming combo that I play this Deck more than I should.)  Beta The Electromagnet Warrior + Magnetic Field + Magnet Induction  Activate Magnetic Field, panic because you really hope your opponent doesn't have a hand trap, then Normal Summon Beta The Electromagnet Warrior. Use Beta The Electromagnet Warrior's effect to add Delta The Magnet Warrior from Deck to hand, then activate Magnet Induction to Special Summon Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck.Â  Use Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior's effect to summon the Delta from hand, and mill an Epsilon. Now your first instinct, especially when playing on a simulator (because let's be real, who would spend $95+ on a Magnet Warrior Deck?) is to immediately activate Magnetic Field to Special Summon Epsilon and mill an Alpha, then immediately forfeit because you realized how stupid that was. Instead, hold back from using field for a bit, and make Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss (SYNERGYYYYY). Use its effect to mill and Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior and get an insignificant 2200 ATK. NOW you use Magnetic Field to Special Summon Epsilon The Magnet Warrior from grave, which then mills any Magnet Warrior except an Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior, to Special Summon the milled Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior. Use its effect to add a Level 8 Magna Warrior, and well, you know the procedure when you've got 2 Level 4s out.  <strong>Overview of the Deck:</strong>  Magnet Warriors are an interesting bunch. Lots of people complain that they don't do much by themselves and need lots of support to even be playable (not that new support is unwelcome, please give us the rest of the Magnets, Konami), and while that's true, this has always been the design of Magnet Warriors. From day 1, Valkyrion's design implicates that the main function of Magnets was for being a Tribute engine to turbo out high level monsters like the god cards (which wasn't practical, but hey it's something). Their continued support has simply allowed them to adapt, and enhanced their ability to support other strategies even more. Now, whether or not this design choice was a good one is up for a debate that I could honestly care less about. What is a fact though, is that Magnet Warriors have a degree of splashability and weird field interactions that give them a variety of play styles, and always leaves them open for experimentation.

For full combos, watch: https://youtu.be/pttLC3YfmLo","In the original build, I missed adding Called By The Grave, so I added it here.  Things you should know about the deck: Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode's effect to negate and comeback to the field is not hard once per turn, so you can still chain Torrential Tribute at the end of the turn when it comes back, your opponent will chain some negate or effect to protect his monsters not knowing that you can negate again taking your Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode out of the field safe from destruction, then it will comeback again, and all of this during the end phase and this can be done over and over again. Assault Sentinel when tributed to special summon 1 monster from your hand or deck that specifically lists ""Assault Mode Activate"" in its text, locks you from special summoning monsters from the extra deck for the rest of the turn, except for synchro monsters. When you use Assault Sentinel's effect and it leaves the field, PSY-Framegear Gamma becomes live to negate any hand trap since there are no monsters on your side. If you have Plaguespreader Zombie &amp; Emergency Teleport/One For One, you can bait hand traps using the Halqifibrax &amp; Auroradon combo, then use Emergency Teleport to summon Psi-Reflector and do your main combo. If Assault Sentinel gets negated and you have Emergency Teleport/One For One, you can special summon Psi-Reflector and continue combo.

I've added anti-spell fragrance and Night Beam to the side deck, along with D.D. Crow.  &nbsp;  EDIT 2: I decided to just forego the Krawler and just play Mine. Works better for what I need it for, and I'm not using it for some burn deck or what have you, so i don't have much guilt in using Mine in this context. I also tried to cut it down to a 40 card deck. Figuring out what to add, what to remove, what to reduce or increase, etc. was a little tricky, but I think what I have is fairly consistent (well, as consistent as a deck with Generaiders, 3 Parallel eXceed, and a main deck Evil Twin boss monster can be).  &nbsp;  EDIT 3: I've been tweaking around my Mystic Mine searchers, as well as I've added 2 Pot of Dualities to support my secondary stall-strategy. I would run a strategy other than Mine if other strategies were more affordable considering this is going to be my IRL deck. Lightning Storm, Forbidden Droplet and Pot of Prosperity really need lower rarity prints at some point.  &nbsp;  EDIT 4: I tried to prioritize making the deck more budget friendly since I feel like the main reason someone would even be playing a Mine deck is if money is an issue (given that its still stupidly cheap compared to cards like Droplet)."

But Iâm glad to be back at it!,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Hi guys! Welcome back to a magistus list!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I havenât made a guide in a while, but I decided to make one today for some reason, I donât know why.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This isnât a Complete Breakdown guide, this is just a list of card reasonings and other stuff. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But overall this particular deck is what I like to call magistus calamity turbo, itâs a moderately successful form of deck thatâs very control oriented.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But for now, the cards!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Fairy Tail Snow</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Snow was recently released from its long stay on the banlist, it got banned because it had no once per turn clause on it meaning it provided additional interruption in some decks. But as a level 4 spellcaster I can also use it to make plays in addition to other things. Pretty helpful if you ask me.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Crowley is simple enough, you can discard a spellcaster and summon him then you can flip his attribute (this effect is virtually useless) and reequip a magistus if heâs in the graveyard. Solid extender and played at three.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Incredible Esscaila the Virtuous</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Esscaila from the short lived rein of swordsouls serves a purpose in magistus for being capable of behaving as a tuner for the synchro summon of the Calamity or risen. Sadly though she hits your wallet pretty hard because of how she was abused by other decks.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Zoroa is the most valuable of the Magistus. He allows you to equip summon search and more! Even though there is only two effects on him heâs worth playing three of in magistus alone.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Endymion the Magistus of Mastery</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Endymion is a magistus with a unique position in the deck, it plus ones your hand and draws are always welcome, but at the same time it kinda lacks something. I opted three though because I love my advantage and itâs water so I can play dragite.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Performage Hat Tricker</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If two or more monsters are on the field you can just summon it from your hand, thatâs all I need from it ngl so I play a copy. Other players can opt for more of this card and itâs pretty solid in Magistus but I personally slip by with one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Rilliona the Magician of Verre</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rilliona will soon grow to become the founder of the witchcrafters but for now she is one of Magistusâs most valuable cards as she is a searcher for spells and traps with a helpful grave effect to equip another Magistus.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Need I say why?</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even though it takes up the normal summon this card is definitely an option to consider when playing Magistus, I play the full blown knowledge package.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Magicianâs Souls</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Souls currently holds a unique place in the metagame for being able to refresh your hand, but what Magistus has over others when it comes to souls is that I can use it to pitch my used-up equips for draws and it doesnât even take a normal summon to do so! If youâre to play Magistus and can afford it PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE play the magicians souls package, I promise itâll make your life so much easier.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Illusion of Chaos</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Illusion of Chaos searches magicians souls and packs itself into the deck making it pretty valuable on that front. I recommend playing it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Trismagistus</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The continuous spell for Magistus is a very solid card for them, in other decks this wouldnât be the same way but Magistus has a severe lack of ways to summon over certain amount of monsters from your hand each turn. Plus this card provides a continuous protection effect!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Foolish Burial</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Being able to send snow to the graveyard is a good enough reason alone to play this. And even if you canât send snow (AKA you opened it) you can still set up Crowley or Rilliona and get their grave effects ready</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Magistus Invocation</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rillionaâs main search invocation is a fusion spell that can fuse away your equips and the fusion monster it can summon is also a very solid boss so I recommend playing this card, you can get it easily enough by draws or Rilliona so please donât play more than one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Magistus Virtra</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A revival spell with a built in protection effect is valuable to a deck that wants to keep one monster out and you can also pitch it with souls if it is clogging.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Spellbook of Knowledge</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Part of the Knowledge engine this card lets you plus pretty easily, 10/10 would recommend.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Spellbook of Secrets</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The last part of the Knowledge engine Secrets is three extra copies of the plus 1 this engine provides.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One to summon and one to equip, Aiwass is an interruption who also makes it harder to beat over your boss monsters, playing three is a mistake and one is fine but I prefer two.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Adamacipator Risen-Dragite</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dragite can gain its interruption from Endymion or the Spellbook magician, thatâs the only reasoning Iâll give you on this front, the rest you can infer for yourself. (For the record this is a pretty flexible slot so if you want you can try some other cards go right ahead, I went with what I thought I could get the most mileage out of)</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Zoroa the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The boos of the whole deck.

But as a dark for accesscode, a solid link 2 stepping stone on your way to selene, and able to search a part of the Knowledge package this Crowley is a pretty helpful assist to this build, I would recommend running him if youâre using the Spellbook package.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The reason why this card is pricy is because itâs simply put: solid invocation food.

It feels great to play it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You may notice that the list I have finished writing a guide for is heavy on card advantage, and your right, thatâs what this build does, it tries to lock your opponents down and amasses resources until it can go for the kill. Despite this looking underwhelming it is actually pretty efficient at times.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">What this deck lacks the most is definitely kill power, but generating advantage on a whim is definitely very helpful.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overall I would classify this particular list as a midrange deck as it pumps out something and preps your hand for the next turn until it can kill. I can see people calling this control and I understand why but my experience is that Iâm doing too many combo based plays that I donât feel like itâs actually control.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Questions will be answered and Iâm more than happy to respond to comments!</span></p>"

Link below:</span></p> <span>( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=btLm4BQf2ew&amp;feature=youtu.be"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=btLm4BQf2ew&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> )</span>  -Exo  &nbsp;  So our Dragon fren has been getting quite the reception recently, and it was about time I got into making a non-Despia related Branded list myself. The reason of choosing an Orcust - Shaddoll hybrid list was simple: both have quite an oddly unique synergy to each other. Not because they're both Dark; but the GY synergy they both work upon to me interest me for some reason. It's a little rare for some people to appreciate the love oddball synergy between two unexpected things; but it does happen in this game from time to time. The Branded pieces (while not the biggest player in this deck) still does what it needs to do best, and here it was truly matters.  Now for the most part, you just have two copies of <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> and one copy of <a data-name=""Albion the Shrouded Dragon"">Albion the Shrouded Dragon (with the usual three copies of </a><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion), because obviously this is the norm thanks to the ""Heathenry"" caused by the Despia archetype, and the lackluster exploitation of </a><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">. Speaking of which, didn't I forget to mention that a Shaddoll package was in here? Yep, it's pretty basic (with just 2 copies of </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Squatma"">Shaddoll Squatma</a><a data-name=""Branded Fusion""> and </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon, and a copy each of </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Shaddoll Hedgehog</a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon""> and </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Shaddoll Beast</a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">); but because of this, I also opted to run a copy of </a><a data-name=""Trickstar Corobane"">Trickstar Corobane</a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon""> and </a><a data-name=""Fairy Tail - SnowÂ "">Fairy Tail - Snow (to be used to Fusion summon either </a><a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a><a data-name=""Fairy Tail - SnowÂ ""> or </a><a data-name=""El Shaddoll ConstructÂ "">El Shaddoll Construct). Now as for our favourite devastator to all DARK-attribute monsters </a><a data-name=""Super PolymerizationÂ "">Super Polymerization, I have two Extra Deck targets that can help clear away some issues; but both could also be used with the effect of </a><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz: </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia (used to rid of hard to handle monsters like </a><a data-name=""Despia Quaeritis"">Despia Quaeritis)</a><a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Â  and </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum (as a board wipe, better than </a><a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a><a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum""> IMO).</a>  Finally comes the discussing point here: The Orcust engine and why I added it in. Truth is that I find the GY consistency of Orcust to always come in handy in decks like Shaddolls in times of need (with or without <a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror). With that being said (knowing that </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte AnacondaÂ "">Predaplant Verte Anaconda is on its way out), I have added the only engine that truly matters to the Orcust engine as we speak: three copies of Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight, two copies of </a><a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare, and one copy of both World Legacy-""World Wand"" and </a><a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton. All of them which allowed me to not only get the usual Link monsters that Orcust requires (such as </a><a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automation"">Galatea, the Orcust Automation</a><a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">), but also be apart in the process of the fusion summoning requirements for both the Branded and Shaddoll monsters as ""backup payment"" (especially for </a><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda).Â </a>  &nbsp;"

This setup probably isn't very fun to play against, but it's effective and it works in most cases.</p><p>--Scythe Lock--</p><p>Ideally, you want to go first with this deck to set up the Scythe lock. While there are many full combo hands that you can draw to facilitate this play, your main goal in the first step of the Scythe lock is to get Scales, Soulpiercer, and an SHS tuner on the field. In order to do this, you need to activate the effect of Scarecrow and then tribute it to activate the effect of Soulpeacemaker. From here, use Scales and Soulpiercer to Link Summon Dagda. Activate Soulpiercer once again to add Soulclaw to your hand. Then, equip Soulclaw to the SHS tuner you left on your field in order to activate its on-field effect and trigger Dagda. After you Summon Soulclaw and set Scythe, use Dagda and the SHS tuner to Link Summon Halquifibrax. Proceed to activate Halquifibrax's effect to Summon Ghost Belle from your deck. Finally, using Soulclaw and Ghost Belle, Synchro Summon Naturia Beast. At this point, the Scythe lock is set and you can end your turn.</p><p>During your opponent's turn, use Halquifibrax's effect to Summon Wonder Magician as quickly as possible. I personally wait to use this when my opponent controls a monster in order to stop Gamma. After Wonder Magician is Summoned, use its effect to destroy Scythe. After you Summon Scythe to your field, activate Wonder Magician's effect to Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur using Scythe as material. And there you have it. One omni-negate, one Imperial Order on legs, and one Extra Deck lock on your opponent. If your opponent is playing a standard combo deck, this is probably where they are going to scoop.</p><p>--Auroradon-Borreload-Musashi-Follow-Up--</p><p>As a follow-up, you can get three SHS monsters on the field to Link Summon Auroradon. Use Auroradon's effect to Summon O'Lion from the deck by making it tribute itself and a token. Using your present materials, Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon and equip it with Auroradon from the grave. You can also activate O'Lion's effect to Summon a token. If you also managed to add Trumpeter to your hand earlier, you can use it and the O'Lion token to Summon Musashi and recycle a machine monster for later use.</p><p>--General Tips--</p><p>Soulpeacemaker, Soulpiercer, and Wagon are the three critical pieces of this deck. Soulpeacemaker Special Summons from the deck, Soulpiercer has a non-once-per-turn search effect, and Wagon is the searcher that searches out these two searchers. Another very integral part of this deck is Scarecrow, which you will usually use to trigger Soulpiercer's effect and to recycle resources for more combos and plays. Another less crucial but still important card is Flutist, which can save you from Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence. Outside of these necessary cards, I also packed in cards for different situations. Lithosagym can be a mini Scythe in case you brick. Jizukiru is good for removal and Gandarla is good for getting rid of the Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds in a Floowandereeze deck. Tunneler is good for recycling your SHS monsters, especially for the Scarecrows and Musashi.</p><p>For the cards in the Extra Deck, you use Musashi to recycle important machine monsters and to maybe even recycle Jizukiru. If you're in need of a Harpie's Feather Duster, Synchro Summon Ogre Shutendoji to clear your opponent's backrow. If you need to use your opponent's Spell and Trap cards to keep surviving, you can Summon out Warlord Susanowo. For a quick finisher, you can Summon out Steam Train King by either Synchro Summoning it normally or using Battleball's effect on a Jizukiru you gave to your opponent. If you ever get stuck with bad hand, Xyz Summoning out Bagooska and hope for the best. Bagooska is also good going second if you have Scales and a Level 4 monster. By Special Summoning Scales and Normal Summoning a Level 4 monster, you can create Bagooska and shut down your opponent's negate board without activating any effects.</p>"

Isn't Meta but surprisingly is consistent and fun to play. Gadget players: ""No you can't just take my monsters for free"". Re","Ok so this Deck, the second one from N/R Format. This Deck wasn't built by me I received a lot of help by some Discord users named Domnostein [Megalith Best Deck!] and Monk, The Local Ballpark Player (Yes this was in a N/R Format Discord Server). This is a really budget Relinquished deck it's extremely cheap.  The objective is summoning Relinquished. For that you can use the Impcantation engine to speed up the strategy and making it more consistent, I completly forgot this engine so at first I was thinking of Djinn of Rituals Archetype and Sphere Kuriboh to try to have more options for the Deck.  The main weakness for this deck it's the fact that you NEED enemy monsters to kill your opponent, being Sonic Bird, Manju, and Senju your ""Beaters"" with 1400 ATK; so in the case you have your 3 copies of Relinquished in the GY and no way to recover it, that's GG; it's like an Pure Eldlitch having it's 3 copies of Eldlitch banished face down or absorbed by a Thousand Eyes Restricted.  After testing it out the best option it's going second. 'Cause your best combos ends with Relinquished and when you do that going first you hav in the best of cases 1 maybe 2 Relinquished with 1 or 2 Impcantation monster.  If you feel very brave you could try it out in Rankeds, you'll regret it very quickly.  Have fun. :3"

Once you've made some space, synchro into Monoceros, special Coelacanth back and then discard a card to summon Fishborg or another Swamp Eel out. Then you can easily go into Dragite, turn the token into a Linkuriboh and then use the Link-2, Linkuriboh, and Big Fish Boi to make Apollousa.</b>  <strong>Important card explanations:</strong>  Deep Sea Dive/Guitar Gurnards: One card combo to make Dragite or Monoceros. Diva can also summon Minstrel to fill graveyard and stack an extender on top of the deck.  Eria: My choice for a generic Link-2. Has some functionality against decks that run Water Monsters and is a Water monster itself (works with Abyss Dweller).  Deep Sea Minstrel: Crucial to pick out Ash Blossom or Impermanence out of your opponent's hand before going Turbo. Also provides synergy with Diva.  Linkuriboh: Generic Link-1, ideally turns your Oyster Token into something that can make Apollousa. Can also be summoned from the grave with Beautunaful Princess to deal with big boss monsters during battle phase.  <strong>Other Possible Budget Card Choices (not included):</strong>  Knightmare Phoenix: Pops Macro Cosmos or Dimensional Fissure. Having access to the grave is critical for the deck.  Glacial Beast Iceberg Narwhal: Great finisher card, helps insure lethal.

And if you're lucky you can bring out Uria for the big numbers!  More seriously this deck is making use of the fact that Sacred Beasts have an easy line to Curious that allows them to dump Eldlich to get him into rotation. From there it's slandered eldlich stuff while sometimes getting out Uria to remove set cards and deal massive damage thanks to the boatload of continuous traps and the grave, pumped up even further if you manage to get Hyper Blaze on the field. The extra deck is mostly just a toolbox of stuff to help deal with cards and deal enough damage for game. The exceptions to this are the trifecta of cards that are central to this deck, Linkuriboh, Relinquished Anima, and Curious. By utilizing the fact that Chaos Summoning Beast is a level 1 that can be summoned by Dark Beckoning Beast and brought back by Opening of The Spirt Gates you can easily make Linkuriboh and Relinquished Anima. Along with the Dark Beckoning on field that's enough material for Curious."

Consistent 5 negates and a floodgate.,"Simple plant Link, will change with DIFO coming out next month.  The idea is to try to end as often as possible with Benghalancer, Cactus, and some other negates or protection on the field when going first. This will require special summoning the Loci, however, so may not always be possible.  Get Loci on the field either by using Unexpected Dai, or White Roise Cloister if you have it or a Lonefire blossom to tribute to summon it from deck, if you have the cloister but no Lonefire nor Loci hopefully you have a Painful Decisions, and if not, let's hope you at least have a rescue rabbit.  Once you have a loci on the board, link it for a Dryas, activate Dryas to search Sowing, use Sowing to summon Twins from deck, then Chain Link 1 Dryas to heal the damage of the Sowing and summon a Sunvine Healer from Extra Deck, and Chain Link 2 the Twin to get the Loci back from grave. Use the effect of Healer to gain 300 health (don't forget this, it is needed to summon Laurel in a few effects).  Link off the Dryas and Healer for Jasmine, then use Jasmine's effect to tribute the Twin and summon Mardel from Deck (hoping she's not in your hand, else you'll have to get creative). Mardel effect on summon to search Laurel (if not in your hand), then Laurel effect to special summon itself.  Link Laurel and Mardel Loci into a second Jasmine. Activate Laurel's effect in grave to heal 500, and trigger the effects to search of both Jasmines.  This is where it becomes situational, and depends on what you have in your hand. If you have one of the Rikkas, and you haven't normal summoned yet, search the other Rikka and a Cactus Bouncer. If you have either Carrotweight or Spore in hand, and you haven't normal summoned yet, search the other and the Cactus Bouncer. If you have neither but you haven't normal summoned yet, but you have any other plant monster in hand, get Snowdrop and the Bouncer. If you have used your normal summon, either search a full package, or, if you have part of one in hand, get what you're missing and either Teardrop or Carrotweight. You may also opt to get the bouncer regardless since you'll most likely be able to normal summon it next turn after still making big bodies on the field if you can't OTK your opponent.  Once you've done your searches, the rest of the Sunavalon part is Jasmine and Mardel link into Melias, Melias effect to summon Loci from grave, Jasmine and Loci for Melias, Melias effect to summon Loci from grave again, then Loci link into the second Dryas, which searches for Shrine. Careful to summon the first Melias with the Jasmine in the main monster zone to a zone pointed by the one in the Extra monster zone, and the second in a zone next to that one, since Melias does not have a downward arrow, so if it is in the Extra zone, it will prevent you from link summoning without using it.  You can use Shrine now, or once you have the Dryantrentiay out, doesn't really matter, but remember that you need a Sunavalon Link Monster on the field to activate it. Once you do, if you have Carrotweight and Spore in hand, activate it by sending Carrotweight to grave, then use its effct by sending Spore to the grave to summon itself, then use Spore's effect in grave to banish Laurel and summon itself gaining 1 level from Laurel, which then lets you synchro the two of them off for Marjoram, which lets you search Blessed Winds. If you have a Rikka in Hand, you can tribute the Loci for their effect, and if Mudan comes out you can sarch Rikka Sheet. If you summon Snowdrop and another plant, use Snowdrop's effect to make them both level 8, then overlay them for Teardrop.  Link the Dryas and a Melias into Benghalancer, then link the Benghalancer and the other Melias into Dryantrentiay. Drientrentiay will search you Bloom from deck. Then use the effect of Benghalancer in grave to banish the Jasmines and summon itself back in a zone pointed by Dryantrentiay (preferably not the same one in case a column negation occurs).  Use Pot of Avarice now, if you have it, mainly resetting your extra deck so you don't throw too much back into the main deck, that way you have more odds of drawing some hand traps off it.  If you don't draw any extenders, normal summon the Cactus Bouncer, set whichever traps you got through the combos, and pass.  There is an alternate route for the Rikkas on which you end up with Strenna on the board, you can use her effect to add back a plant from grave to hand, do that before your turn, it's free real estate, as she will most likely be tributed next turn by Rikka Sheet to negate and steal a monster, and summon out Hyperyton with her as material attached to it.  Beware of the synergy between Blessed Winds and Marjoram: when you gain health, you can use Marjoram to pop a card.  Benghalancer bounces back to the hand in exchange for Life Points equal to the bounced monster's attack. If you have Cactus Bouncer up on the field with it, you can negate the card with one of your negates on summon, then bounce it back with Benghalancer, and they can't normal summon anymore, nor special summon unless they deal with the bouncer.  If your opponent tries to pop your plant link monsters, you can banish Sowing from grave to protect them.  While your LP are higher than your opponents and you have Marjoram on the field, your plant monsters cannot be targeted with card effects.  If you plan on putting out a Bouncer, do not try to go down the Strenna into Hyperyton line, as that is a special summon, which you cannot conduct while Bouncer is on your field.  Don't forget Benghalancer's recursion if it's taken off the field. It will be a target since Dryantrentiay cannot be target by effects nor attacks.  Dryantrentiay's effect is not a quick effect, but on your turn you can pop a link monster it points to (wink wink to Benghalancer who can come back), and pop as many cards your opponent controls as it had Link rating (so most likely 4).  Every turn after activating Shrine, it gives you a free Loci from grave, which can be turned into a thrasher, that can get 4k attack thanks to Dryantrentiay being on the field, but beware it will be destroyed if Dryantrentiay is destroyed by a non-targeting effect.  Bloom, beyond negating all face up monsters on your opponent's field when activated if you have a link 4 plant (Benghalancer counts) also lets you make a plant link monster gain attack equal to that of all the cards it points to. So if you first use Thrasher to kill a monster, then use its effect to summon it back to a zone pointed by the big tree, you can increase the attack of Dryantrentiay by that much more when it attacks. If you can get a second thrasher out, try to put the Benghalancer in a zone not pointed by Dryantrentiay when you summon it back, that way you can have 2 4k Thrashers and a big monster from your opponent's grave fueling the big tree's attack through Bloom.  If you run into a lot of Nibirus, you can play Sales Ban, or you can try other variants of the deck that run the Brave package, but that would triple the cost of the deck. Also feel free to adapt hand traps and Side deck to your scene's habits."

I'm just saying that it doesn't make sense.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a></strong> - <span>Normal Summon Rod, add Illusion Magic, Dark Magical Circle, or Eternal Soul, or anything else you wanna do instead.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> - <span>Probably the most broken (and expensive) card in this deck, aside from Branded Fusion. It can either set up your GY or Special Summon a Dark Magician from your GY (and technically from your Deck), and it draws you cards.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a></strong> - <span>Reveal this card, add Magicians' Souls or Magician's Rod. Also a Fusion Material for <a data-name=""Master of Chaos"">Master of Chaos</a>.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Eye of Timaeus"">Eye of Timaeus</a></strong> - <span>A searchable Dark Magician Fusion monster because that's what it practically is, usually Dark Magician/Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight or The Dark Magicians.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Dark Magic Attack"">Dark Magic Attack</a></strong> - A searchable b<span>ack row removal. This could also be <a data-name=""Dark Burning Magic"">Dark Burning Magic</a> if you just want to wipe your opponent's entire board instead.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Bond Between Teacher and Student"">Bond Between Teacher and Student</a></strong> - <span>A free <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> and Dark Magic Attack/Dark Burning Magic.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Secrets of Dark Magic"">Secrets of Dark Magic</a></strong> - <span>The original Magikey Maftea, it's both a Fusion Spell and a Ritual Spell, except it's also a Quick-Play Spell.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Illusion Magic"">Illusion Magic</a></strong> - <span>Another searchable one of searcher.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a></strong> - <span>Your most important card. It's a search (sort of) upon activation, and it's an interruption in the form of a targeting (boo) banishing effect (yay) triggered when a ""Dark Magician"" (that counts your Fusion Monsters that are treated as such as well) is Summoned to your field. Searchers should always be played at maximum quantities, especially this one, though you could get away with playing 2 since it itself is also searchable, I guess.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a></strong> - <span>This one feels weird, because in Pure Dark Magicians, you gotta play at least 2-3 copies of this but in this version, it feels weak and strangely enough it feels stronger with its interruption effect when in the GY. I'll leave this one up to you but just one of this, I feel I can get by.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a></strong> - <span>Your second most important card. The reason why your Dark Magical Circle can spam banish effects. Also, protect this card <strong>at all costs</strong>, because it's gonna blow up your entire board when your opponent gets rid of it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Combination"">Magicians' Combination</a></strong> - <span>It's a negate, except it's actually pretty fun to use, since it lets you tag in and out of your Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl. Also, it negates the effect, not the activation so... keep that in mind because it's relevant.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span>â¢ <strong><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> - <span>The big boss monster towers negate, but this time it can actually pop monsters and burn.</span></span>  <span>â¢Â <strong><a data-name=""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician the Dragon Knight</a></strong> - <span>Your second boss monster, mainly because it protects your back row from targeting and destruction. I like to play 2 for insurance but you can probably get away with just playing 1.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <strong><a data-name=""Master of Chaos"">Master of Chaos</a></strong> - <span>This one's purely experimental, I never actually see this come up to be honest, but because I'm playing Illusion of Chaos, might as well use it.</span></span>  <span>â¢Â <strong><a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a></strong> - <span>A neat one of monster that draws you a card whenever a Spell/Trap is activated, be it by you or your opponent. It also floats into both Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl so, that's cool I guess.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <strong><a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight</a></strong> - <span>Quick-Play pop on a face-up card at a cost of a discard might sound hefty at times, but better have it than not.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>It's a fun deck to play. I mean, that's what both Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes are, really, they don't strike me as the most competitive decks there are but, you know... it still has the Dark Magician bricking issue though despite already cutting it down to just 2 copies. It also has the same problems with the other deck that I've been testing and working on lately - Branded Tearalaments - that sometimes the deck feels too slow and sometimes it just ramps up out of nowhere swiftly, though I think that only says much about the pilot and not necessarily about the deck itself, which makes sense since I love fast-paced decks, and speed is one of the most important criteria for me when it comes to testing decks, I'm still not sure. Regardless, the deck worked better than expected, definitely. It's still basically just two control decks that share incidental synergies being both Fusion strategies merged into one. Also, it's great that most if not all of the Dark Magician Fusion monsters are all Level 8, which is just the perfect Level for the Branded so, yeah. That's pretty much it. Also if you wanna do the Guardian Chimera thing, feel free to do so in this list only because the Extra Deck is actually pretty loose and you can afford to cut down some cards. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Presenting, Branded Tearalaments.</span>  <strong><span>""Why play this deck?""</span></strong>  <span>Well... I love Fusion Summoning, and I love Fusion Summoning more than once. What's actually funny about this list is that since I've decided to cut the <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">DPE </a>engine, I can now play <a data-name=""Visas Starfrost"">Visas Starfrost</a>, which means there's a line in this list that can bring out <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a> before your fifth summon, though it kills your <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> but you know what, that's fine, because after months of endless testing Branded lists, the archetypal Field Spell <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> is pretty underrated. That also means you could search for any ""Branded"" Spell/Trap instead of rushing into Branded Fusion, you still have your Tearalaments cards that can do your Fusion Summoning for you by recycling the materials from your hand, field, and/or GY back into the Deck, and that Fusion Summon is not Level restricted, that means that if you have a bunch of DARK Fairies in your GY, you can actually still bring <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> this way. As fast as the Branded engine is in terms of spending all your resources from the deck, the Tearalaments cards bring that ever so needed recycling power at a cost of sacrificing some of your GY set up. Anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span>I've already explained my standard ratio for the Branded engine before, but as a refresher, here it is:</span>  <span>â¢ x2 <a data-name=""Aluber Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a>Â &amp; <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia</a>, <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a> for monsters.</span> <span>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> with/without x1Â <a data-name=""Branded In Red"">Branded In Red</a>Â for the Spells, depending on whether you want to useÂ <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> or not for the spells.</span> <span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> with/without x2-3 <a data-name=""Branded Retribution"">Branded Retribution</a> for traps.</span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ The Tearalaments cards</strong> - <span>The only cards that I feel like needs to be discussed, especially in terms of ratio.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Rainoheart&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Rainoheart</strong></a> - <span>This is your other Normal Summon, just following the standard rule of 5 per deck. He sends any copy of ""Tearalaments"" monster from your deck, except a copy of himself. He also has an effect to summon himself when sent to the GY by a card effect but banishes when removed from the field.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Shaylen&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Shaylen</strong></a> - <span>The main extender of the Tearalaments, has an effect to Special Summon herself from your hand and allows you to send a monster from your hand to the GY and mill 3 cards off the top of your deck. This is all a part of the effect, which means it can trigger your Despian Tragedy's search effect. She also has the archetypal effect that she shares with the following other 2 Tearalaments monsters, to Fusion Summon ANY Fusion Monster when sent to the GY by a card effect, by shuffling the Fusion Materials from your hand, field, and/or GY into the deck. We only play 2 of her because she can easily be milled anyway.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Haufenis&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Haufenis</strong></a> - <span>The obligatory pseudo-hand trap of the archetype, has an effect that can be activated in response to an opponent's monster effect activated on the field that allows herself to be Special Summoned from your hand and mills 3 cards off the top of your deck, alongside her GY effect to Fusion Summon. We only play 1 of her for the same reason as Shaylen's.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Meiru&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Meiru</strong></a> - <span>The other archetypal Normal Summon, except we're playing less copies of her and just more of Rainoheart instead because he's a name for the purposes of Fusion Summoning despite both being very much searchable. Has the effect to also mill 3 cards off the top of your deck when she's either Normal or Special Summoned, alongside her GY effect to Fusion Summon. We also only play 1 of her for the same reason as her sisters'.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>No Tearalaments Spell(s) because they don't have anything so far that helps with this particular version of the build.</span>  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ x3 <a data-name=""Tearalaments Crime"">Tearalaments Crime</a></strong> - <span>The obligatory archetypal omni-negate Counter Trap that can be activated if you control either a ""Tearalaments"" monster or a ""Visas Starfrost"". It negates the activation, but it shuffles the card back to the deck instead, then allows you to send a card from your hand to the GY (potentially a ""Tearalaments"" monster, Despian Tragedy, or any one of brick that needs to be in the GY.)</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span>â¢ x1 <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido Heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido Heart</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kitkalos"">Tearalaments Kitkalos</a></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Kitkalos is a Level 5 Fusion Monster that requires only 1 ""Tearalaments"" monster and an Aqua monster, and has three effects. The first is her being a pseudo-searcher upon getting Special Summoned (not just Fusion Summoned). Second is the effect that allows you to Special Summon a ""Tearalaments"" monster from your hand or GY by sending a monster you control to the GY (which can include herself). Lastly, if she's sent to the GY by a card effect, you can mill 5 cards off the top of your deck. Each of these three are hard once per turn effects.</span></li>  	<li><span>Kaleidoheart is the current boss monster of the Tearalaments, that requires 2 Aqua monsters and Tearalaments Rainoheart in particular, in which we only play 1 of because he's extremely recyclable due to us also playing the Branded engine. He cannot be used as Fusion Material, so that's neat against Mirror Matches. He has the effect that allows you to, upon him or another Aqua-type monster getting Special Summoned while he's on the field, target a card your opponent controls and shuffle it to the deck. If he's sent to the GY by a card effect, he can also Special Summon himself back and lets you send a ""Tearalaments"" card from your Deck to the GY. Both of his effects are all hard once per turns.</span></li> </ol> <strong><span>Final Thoughts:</span></strong>  <span>The first time I've read the Tearalaments cards I've immediately told myself, ""If these cards' effects for a Fusion based archetype don't scream ""we're definitely eventually going to receive a Shaddoll Fusion of our own"", I don't know what does"". Like, it's crazy that compared to the former lore-based archetype, Despias weren't as good initially, but Tearalaments... they only need an extremely good pay off and a consistent enabler, possibly in a form of a Fusion Spell, and trust that I will always be keeping an eye on this archetype with consistent and careful watch because I am extremely excited for this, so much so that it reminds me of the day Despias were initially released. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Despite OCG and TCG being different formats, this particular archetype should be really successful in our format too.  The deck should be consistent, since Splight monsters special summon themselves when you control another level 2 monster card, thus easily allowing the start of your combo. The usual endboard is Toadally Awesome and Splight Elf for two Spell/Trap negates. You should use the Toad first and then revive him (providing that your opponent summons a monster) with Splight Elf's effect. Other notable cards for your endboard are Splight Red and Splight Carrot who provide monster and spell/trap negation respectively.  I should also note that the effect of Gigantic Splight effectively blocks your opponent from using Nibiru thanks to it's second effect"

If you're going first you want to set up for the next turn and try to set up some disruption so you do not get OTK'D Yourself. So how do we do this?  First try going into Number 90. This will put a boss monster that is hard to deal with shy of kaiju that can set up for next turn with its search effect and also negate a monster effect your opponent uses for the turn. if you have a good enough hand to set up two boss monsters you can also try going into cyber dragon infinity which will provide an omni negate but if you do not have the galaxy soliders to do so we can settle for hope harbinger. This will leave you with a monster negate and spell negate which is still annoying to deal with.  Now for the OTK its simple its all about number 62.

Also I am playing 2x Red Reign, this card plus a level 8 or higher Dark Dragon Synchro Monster is almost an instant win against most decks.

The deck strategy remains focused on its win condition through the ""Towers"" called <a data-name=""The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister"">The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</a> and for that the main deck and extra deck have an excellent synergy to do it with a <strong>1 card combo engine</strong>.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>The changes I made to the main deck were:</strong>  Two <a data-name=""Doyon @Ignister"">Doyon @Ignister</a> makes a lot of sense in the deck as it is the fundamental piece that allows you to make 1 Card Combo while maintaining good follow ups in the process. It is a good card to have in your starting hand and <strong>increases the consistency</strong> of the deck overall.  The use of <a data-name=""Hiyari @Ignister"">Hiyari @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Gatchiri @Ignister"">Gatchiri @Ignister</a> makes you able to play around <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, the only detail is that this is only possible in <strong>2 Card Combo</strong> because the only way to add Hiyari to the hand is through <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> or a <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> and for that we should previously have a way to add the main combo pieces to the hand.  I also think it's very important to have as many copies of Field Spell <a data-name=""Ignister A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I.Land</a> as possible because without it your <strong>plays are limited</strong> depending on having extenders like <a data-name=""Gathiri"">Gathiri</a> or <a data-name=""Hiyari"">Hiyari</a> to get somewhere and if your opponent is smart against @Ignister he will keep hand traps like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> for the <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> and <a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> preventing you from accessing the field. And the higher the stat of having 2 field Spells in your hand, the easier it is to use <a data-name=""A.I. Contact"">A.I. Contact</a> which is an excellent consistency card.  As for the Extra Deck I chose to use <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> instead of <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> but many players like to keep <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> to have better chances against <strong>Floodgates</strong> and end up taking <a data-name=""Light Dragon @Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> from the decklist. I prefer to keep XYZ in the extra deck because it gives you the option to have <strong>one more target</strong> for the <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> and it's a great card for the deck <strong>grind game</strong> because it doesn't matter how fast matches are in modern yugioh because there are decks competent enough to get you into a <strong>resource trading game</strong> and <a data-name=""Light Dragon @Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> will help you out a lot in these moments for being <strong>interaction</strong> with the opponent, <strong>protection</strong> of your monsters against destruction by effects and still <strong>helps to give OTK</strong> for giving Reborn of a LINK monster in the Battle Phase.  About <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> my view on the card has changed a lot because before I thought <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a> was a much better card to use as a target for <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> for having an excellent field effect that serves as a <strong>contingency plan</strong> in case your plays are stopped if you <strong>draw 1 card every turn</strong>. But <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> has very interesting applications in the deck: synergy with <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> in the Battle Phase to <strong>destroy an opponent's monster</strong>, it also <strong>inflicts 2300 effect damage</strong> to the opponent, has <strong>floating effect</strong> to return to the field if destroyed by effect of cards or battle. So in many situations it will be this card that will <strong>force interactions</strong> of the opponent's boss monsters like <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> and in the near future the <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> than a Heatsoul.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combos:</strong>  Differences between each Starter is basically in the <strong>first half of the combo</strong> which I say is how you arrive at the following gamestate: <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> + <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> + <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a>/<a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> = <a data-name=""Achichi"">Achichi</a>/<a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a>/<a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> always end up arriving at this part of the combo and from then on it will be the same for everyone what to do next to get to TOWERS.  Place the URL continuation on the <strong>duelingbook</strong> site after <strong>.com/</strong>  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  <strong>Combo 1: Achichi/Pikari 1 Card Combo (Towers 4k ATK)</strong>  If you do <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> first after <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> you can get <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> very early in the combo which is better in most cases than waiting for the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> effect to wear off to do Wind Pegasus.

I'm just showing you that it's possible to <strong>make other end boards in turn 1</strong> if you want to test it.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Many games are decided on the details of some archetype cards</strong> that have very useful side effects and that the <strong>opponent doesn't pay enough attention to</strong>:  <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> has the GY effect of banishing and destroying a Cyberse monster that is <strong>battling during the Damage Step</strong>, with this you <strong>avoid taking Battle Damage and survive a possible OTK</strong> from the opponent <strong>surprising him</strong> by winning another turn. In Master Duel this has happened to me twice: The first against a <strong>Numeron</strong> that summoned 4 monsters and thought it would OTK but couldn't. The second against a <strong>Zoodiac Tri-Brigade</strong> that did <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> + <a data-name=""Shuraig"">Shuraig</a> in just 4 summons and left the LINK-1 <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> on the field because it already had lethal and wanted to play around <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> but in the Battle Phase I used <a data-name=""Achichi"">Achichi</a> eff avoiding the OTK surviving the turn.  <a data-name=""Pikari @Ignister"">Pikari @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Hiyari @Ignister"">Hiyari @Ignister</a> <strong>manipulate levels to 4</strong> until the end of the turn, with Piraki from any other @Ignister Monster like <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a>Â and Hiyari being his own level <strong>allowing you to make RANK-4 plays</strong>.  <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> has a <strong>continuous effect on the field to protect Cyberse monsters</strong> from being destroyed by card effects the <strong>first time each turn</strong>. It doesn't exist in Master Duel, but in the near future <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> (DPE) will come to the game so much that in the game banlist they already put <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> at 2 thinking about this boss monster. This means you'll see much better with the <strong>in-game DPE how useful it is</strong> to take advantage of this <strong>Gatchiri protection</strong> while playing @Ignister which is another detail people forget about in the deck.  <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> can be made using <strong>any @Ignister other than LINK</strong> Monster. So you can use a <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> or <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> as material which is useful when you want to <strong>clear the Main Monster Zone</strong> and use the <a data-name=""Ignister A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I.Land</a> eff or to trigger <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> eff from <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>.  Speaking of <a data-name=""Dark Templar @Ignister"">Dark Templar @Ignister</a> you can use your <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> effect <strong>during the Damage Step</strong> so a peculiar way to play around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> is you Summon 3 Monsters to the field, make the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and go to Battle Phase to <strong>attack and destroy an opponent's monster</strong> and trigger eff of Monster Reborn from the Dark Templar and then when you summon an arrow he points you <strong>bring 2 more @Ignister</strong> to <strong>start your Main Phase 2</strong> making <a data-name=""The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister"">The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</a>. <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> counts the summons made in <strong>all phases of the turn</strong>: Draw Phase, Standby Phase, Main Phase and Battle Phase but it can only use its effect <strong>during the Main Phase</strong> and as you have <strong>Turn Player Priority</strong> you start your Main Phase 2 making Towers playing around Nibiru.  Sometimes the <a data-name=""Danmari @Ignister"">Danmari @Ignister</a> hand effect can help you deal with <strong>floodgates</strong>. Once I was playing against <a data-name=""Eldlich"">Eldlich</a> and my opponent flip <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> on <a data-name=""Dark Infant @Ignister"">Dark Infant @Ignister</a> summon, as I already had <a data-name=""Doyon @Ignister"">Doyon @Ignister</a> in hand I used <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> to add <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> to the hand and then I LINK summon ladder to <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> and bring <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> back to the field with <a data-name=""A.I.dle Reborn"">A.I.dle Reborn</a> and in the Battle Phase I attacked <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> and negated the attack with the <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> effect just for him to enter the field and in Main Phase 2 to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and destroy the Gozen Match.  <a data-name=""Gatchiri @Ignister"">Gatchiri @Ignister</a> only enters the field when <strong>targeting a Cyberse Monster and negating its effects</strong>, if the Cyberse monster's effects are <strong>already negated</strong> you <strong>won't even be able to activate Gatchiri</strong>'s effect to enter the field, so in case you have for example the <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> on the field and would use it to make the <a data-name=""Dark Infant @Ignister"">Dark Infant @Ignister</a> to add the Field Spell and the opponent has a set <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> saved to use in the <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> effect because he knows it's much more important to prevent adding the Field Spell than a monster for the hand, thinking about this possibility of the <strong>Dark Infant being denied</strong> the best thing for you to do is use the <strong>effect of Gatchiri on Achichi</strong> to enter the field because if the Dark Infant has the effects negated you will lose the chance to bring in Gatchiri and continue to have plays on the turn.  <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> only <strong>adds Level 4 or lower @Ignister</strong> monsters to the hand just like <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> only <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>s <strong>Level 4 or lower GY monsters</strong>. The only ways to <strong>add Level 5 or higher @Ignister</strong> to the hand is when using <a data-name=""Hiyari @Ignister"">Hiyari @Ignister</a> eff or <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a>.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Cards that have GY effects important to remember</strong>:  As previously emphasized we have the effect of <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> on <strong>Damage Step</strong> and <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix"">Fire Phoenix</a> <strong>Floating eff</strong> on the next Standby Phase, we also have the most obvious effects that are the ones that no one forgets <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Danmari @Ignister"">Danmari @Ignister</a> that interact with the opponent and the <a data-name=""Ignister A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I.Land</a> to set back on the field.  But the effects that are most overlooked are those of the <strong>deck's Reborn Spells</strong> - <a data-name=""A.I.dle Reborn"">A.I.dle Reborn</a> and <a data-name=""FA.I.ghting Spirit"">FA.I.ghting Spirit</a>. The quick play spell <a data-name=""A.I.dle Reborn"">A.I.dle Reborn</a> allows you when an <strong>attack is declared involving 2 monsters</strong> you banish it and a card from your hand to <strong>add an ""A.I."" Spell/Trap in the GY or banished</strong> to the hand. This is very important to remember with regards to adding an <a data-name=""A.I. Land"">A.I. Land</a> that was banned with <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> back in hand or an <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> who is in the GY during your opponent's turn and you don't have Follow Ups for your next turn, so it's <strong>another unexpected way to take advantage of these details</strong> of the various cards of @Ignister's archetype while your opponent doesn't even realize that <strong>when attacking your monsters is giving you a Follow Up</strong>.  The <a data-name=""FA.I.ghting Spirit"">FA.I.ghting Spirit</a> banishes itself to protect its @Ignister of 23atk+ ATK from <strong>destruction by effects</strong>. And on top of that <strong>when being banned</strong> she activates her other effect of protecting your @Ignister from 23atk or more ATK from <strong>destruction per battle</strong> so there are <strong>several details that make the difference between winning and losing games with @Ignister</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /////// <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong> because it doesn't exist in Master Duel, I'm just showing other examples of tech cards that can be used in the main deck in place of some of the 15 spaces available in the main deck.  &nbsp;"

Come look at some cool engines to splash it with!,"Mostly a going second OTK deck that is super customizable and probably able to be played with 60 cards (Might post that later).  The goal is summon DAD or <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Armed_Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a>. If you don't know this card it is an older meta staple being one of the only Teir 0 decks in the game (not being played with Armed Dragons).  This is a fun card that sort of murders your opponent if they have no negates with an accesscode type effect for DARK monsters.  If you don't like Danger! Dark world I suggest you play some of these engines or even all of them: <ul>  	<li>Phantom Knights</li>  	<li>Burning Abyss</li>  	<li>Destiny Hero &amp;/or the DPE engine</li>  	<li>Shaddolls</li>  	<li>Bamboo Sword (a drawing engine using Equip Spells)</li>  	<li>Raidraptor</li>  	<li>Maybe even blackwings</li>  	<li>Brave/Adventurer (note: it doesn't use DARK monsters)</li>  	<li>Chaos</li>  	<li>Zombies</li>  	<li>Lair of Darkness</li>  	<li>Resonators (Maybe even use the Red Dragon Archfiend Ghost Rare as well)</li>  	<li><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gren_Maju_Da_Eiza"">Gren Maju</a> type deck with cards like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gizmek_Orochi,_the_Serpentron_Sky_Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Eater_of_Millions"">Eater of Millions</a>.</li>  	<li>Red-Eyes</li>  	<li>Dark Magician (Maybe Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon)</li>  	<li>Thunder Dragon</li> </ul> Of course you can make the deck your own by making itÂ  mix between the engines or some not mentioned too.  I chose Danger!s because they are a great monster draw engine consiting of DARK monsters and Dark Worlds for even more draws, PLUS they totally break boards using Grapha and Bigfoot then lastly you can summon DAD to clean up the rest of the board!  And lastly for Side deck I suggest running <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Danger!_Thunderbird!"">Danger! Thunderbird</a> not included in the deck list because I wanted to keep it at 40. Run kaijus probably so you can out the negates to stop your DAD board wipe and probably <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Harpie%27s_Feather_Duster"">Feather Duster</a>. For the rest run whatever you want!

If you know how a banish deck works, you know how this deck works. Just read over the effects of cards you're not sure of. Also keep in mind that you want to go second with this deck since it's an OTK deck and not a negate deck. The only First Turn Play that's super useful is summoning Draglubion and than using Draglubion's effect to summon Hope Harbinger, since that negates one spell card.  A few notes to keep it easier if you are not familiar with some of these cards ( I sure as hell wasn't)  Gigarays Gandora:  You want one of this card in the Graveyard and one other Gandora in the graveyard when you summon this card, you than banish literally everything on the field and can directly attack your opponent with like 10,000 atk.  Gizmek Makami:  When this monster is normal or special summoned, you can discard one card and search for any of your boss monsters (Gizmek Orochi, Gigarays Gandora and Gren Maju). You can also normal summon this card if you have at least 10 cards banished. This is probably your best deck search and draw power, though the utility of Allure of Darkness and Pot of Desires is not lost on me.  At the end of the day this deck has 3 win conditions <ol>  	<li>Gigarays Gandora banishing everything but itself on both fields and hitting ridiculously hard</li>  	<li>Gren Maju hitting ridiculously hard</li>  	<li>Getting two 8 star monsters on the field, summoning Draglubion and using its effect to summoning Numeron Dragon to hit... ridiculously hard</li> </ol>"

Aussa the Earth Channeler,"  Do you like tomboys? Do you like girls with glasses? If you said ""yes"" to either question, you're a man of culture, and you're gonna love this Fossil Adamancipator deck's tech option, Aussa the Earth Channeler! You can discard her and another EARTH monster to search an EARTH Rock or Spellcaster monster with 1850 or less ATK. In most cases, you're gonna want to use her to search Mathemetician, and then normal summon him to dump Weathering Soldier, and finally use Weathering Soldier's effect to search either Fossil Fusion or a card that mentions it.  &nbsp;  Strategy-wise, this is a go-second deck, so you would prefer to do that. But thanks to the Adamancipator engine, you can potentially sit on a 4-negate Apollousa. If you're going second, not only do you have 9 hand traps, but also 2 Cosmic Cyclones and Harpie's Feather Duster.  &nbsp;  I decided to name this deck ""Iwaki Fossil Park"" after the Iwaki Coal Mine and Fossil Museum, located in Iwaki, Japan. This facility features a replica of a coal mine and educates tourists on Iwaki's history of coal mining, and has a beautiful and extensive array of dinosaur skeletons and fossils! So if you're interested in the mining industry, or you're a bit of a dino nerd, then you're really gonna get a kick out of the place. Currently, Japan has not yet opened its borders to tourists, but hopefully that will change soon."

Although only 2 cards were ever printed on the archetype in the TCG/OCG, I was able to build this deck revolving around its concept about Attributes with another archetype which is.. <strong>Shaddolls!</strong> They work surprisingly well with each other <strong>maybe not top tier, but it is usable and fun</strong>. It's probably the closest thing that you'll ever get to be playing the Anime version of this deck until support cards come out. Your main focus is to <strong>have your </strong>Field Spell<strong> Clear World</strong>&nbsp;&amp; go into your <strong>Aces</strong>, using<strong> ""Shaddoll Fusion""</strong> summoning ""<strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a></strong>"" (<strong>sending a Shaddoll monster and ""Clear Vice Dragon"" to the GY since it is a DARK monster</strong>) which will <strong>restrict Special Summons</strong> and either <strong>Special or Tribute Summon</strong> <strong>CVD </strong>while <strong>Clear World</strong> is keeping <strong>you and your monsters safe</strong> <strong>by battle</strong>. <strong>Winda provides a great field presence</strong> with<strong> its own immunity </strong>to destruction effects, but not without its low stats keeping it in check. So it <strong>may have a hard time</strong> attacking, being attacked or doing a lot of dmg, that is why you<strong> have CVD,</strong> they make <strong>a great duo partner </strong>with each other,<strong> Clear Vice Dragon</strong> may look weak, <strong>but</strong> here's the thing, <strong>all of its effect are continous &amp; do not start a chain</strong>, it has its own <strong>Unique</strong> protection effect of destruction <strong>(which is not a cost by the way)</strong> and it does all the battling for <strong>Winda</strong> beating over your opponent's <strong>Beefy High ATK</strong> <strong>Boss monsters, when You Attack</strong> <strong>it gains Double the ATK of that monster (During Dmg Calculation Only)</strong>. It can <strong>beat almost any monster</strong> by battling such as; <strong>""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"", ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"", ""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"", ""Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon"", ""Black Wing Full Armored Master"", and etc</strong>..<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A pretty neet monster <strong>althought</strong>, <strong>it's not OP and is still vulnarble</strong>, but it <strong>gets the job done</strong> <strong>when needed</strong>. Using the Trap card <strong>DNA Transplant</strong> with your Field Spell or <strong>Super Poly</strong> are great going for the <strong>DARK</strong> Attribute since it has more of a field presence than the <strong>other attributes</strong>, <strong>although yes you won't be able to Attack, </strong>that is why<strong> </strong>it is<strong> important </strong>to bring out<strong> CVD as SOON </strong>as <strong>possible</strong> since<strong> You as the player are ""Unnaffected by the effects of Clear World"" OR </strong>you can<strong> just set another Clear World to avoid the detrimental effects in your turn </strong>then activate it once again when you're done battling<strong> (A alternative win condition</strong> could also be done with the Trap card <strong>DNA Transplant </strong>by declaring the <strong>FIRE Attribute,</strong> <strong>If</strong> it comes down to finishing off your opponent when you can't Attack for game just simply <strong>burn them for 1000 Dmg</strong>, <strong>only activate it During you opponent's End Phase for Clear World to trigger the element of surprise on them)</strong>. Using the Spell card ""<strong>Super Polymerization""</strong>, can also help remove almost any of your opponents problematic monsters along the way. For duels <strong>going up against a pure DARK Attributed monsters</strong>, you may <strong>side deck DNA for more useful cards</strong> that you may need for the duel, they'll be bricks because <strong>you'll be going for the DARK Attribute 99% of the time anyways for those non DARK decks</strong>. <strong>If you liked</strong> the Deck Profile, <strong>Please leave a Like &amp; Comment</strong>.

As the name suggests, the deck focuses around the field spell <a data-name=""Wetlands"">Wetlands</a>, a card that is rather specific as conditions are concerned, but the attack boost it provides is extremely substantial. The ability to turn any 0/0 into a 1200/0 is a big game changer. there aren't many ways to search it out so terraforming and metaverse will just have to do. 5 copies of a card is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not as consistent as something like Umi Goodstuff. (i'm working on a list for that so keep an eye out) This deck also centers around a few other cards. The aquarium spells are important as they do multiple different things, 1: they provide an additional stat boost. 2: they provide some protection for your monsters. and 3: they provide a little recursion when destroyed. along with those cards, <a data-name=""Cryomancer"">Cryomancer</a> and <a data-name=""Dewdark of the ice barrier"">Dewdark of the ice barrier</a> are both pretty strong cards for the deck, Cryomancer being a walking gravity bind, and Dewdark just attacking directly for big damage if you have wetlands on board. all of the other cards in the deck aren't as important but they do serve a purpose, most of them are pretty obvious. Now go on out there and beat people to death with the fabled <a data-name=""M I S T A RÂ  B O Y"">M I S T A RÂ  B O Y</a>"

When I first started playing, this would have seemed ridiculous. Part of it is that the archetype got a new sweet boss monster, the Omni-Negate value-engine that tags out - part of it is the broken trap and the new broken starter - but mostly, this deck was waiting for the metagame to shift, and for players who believed in the deck to develop it.  I'm not an amazing Dragonmaid player, but I love me some Dragon decks, and I genuinely think Dragon Waifus is not just the best Dragon deck, but the best home for the Rokket package right now in the Master Duel meta. I have been working on this for a little bit, and I think I have this engine humming right now, so I wanted to share it.  The interruptions in the format are pretty standard. Maxx ""C"" is kinda nutso, and Ash answers Maxx ""C"" - Called By is also nutso even in the absence of Maxx ""C"" and if one of the few great answers to the sneaky insect. I don't love Ash tbh, but so long as it is a Maxx ""C"" meta these cards seem pretty standard and essential. After that all I'm doing is leaning on in-engine interaction and extra-deck utility monsters.  So, for Maid form Dragonmaids I'm on 7 - 3 Chamber, 3 Parlor, and 1 Nurse. Chamber and Parlor are kind of your Aleister - they both have good setups into Hieratic Seal, they both search the Fusion spell for Fusion set-ups, which is important since Sheou is the deck's main game plan. In this deck, they also can help set up Romulus plays, which is pretty rad. Chamber is mostly better than Parlor, but they're at their best when you activate both in the same turn, so the deck is built to do that. It would be nice if Kitchen also worked as a decent starter, but in practice I'd rather cut it - it doesn't have a lot of great setups, and isn't a 1-card boss monster like these other starters. Nurse, on the other hand, is kind of awesome - it'll help make the god plays possible with Foolish effects, and is summonable off of Seal for incredible value. The main value in Parlor over Chamber is sending the Dragon Form high-level monsters from the deck to the GY, but it does enable a bunch of weird set-ups. I'd love more starts into these cards, since they are my main engine, but for now that means reliance on other 2 card combo engines.  I also knew I needed high-level Dragon monsters to make Sheou with, and I wanted a good solid package of 5. 1 Absorouter makes so much sense - getting to start plays by summoning Sheou, then searching Tracer is kinda cray, and this card being in the deck also makes Tracer searchable using the Extra Deck. You also do need high-level Dragonmaids to tag out into - I like 2 Lorpar, because going second the card is extremely good, but 1 Ernus seems fine. You could put whatever you wanted in the last slot really, but I like using Chaos Dragon Levianeer going second to break board, and it'll occasionally get a snipe going first. It also is just fine as Fusion material from the hand if you can't summon it. I shifted out a Lorpar into Nurdyle, which seems good so far.  I'm running 5 Fusion Spells, but you have a lot of access to the main one with the 6 other Dragonmaids - you want to see exactly one copy of these so you don't have to search is, so again, you run 5. Dragonmaid Changeover is the best generic poly available in Dragonmaids, and in addition to its Fusion effect not being once per turn, it also can enable loopy nonsense that is both value and interruptive when you see it, so the risk of running multiples is low while the payoff of seeing a copy is huge. if you wanted to you could run Verte and 1 copy of Poly, which will mostly just be Changeover for all intents and purposes, but in testing it never came up because it was always a bad value play. You could also run Despia, Theatre of the Branded, as all of your Fusion Monsters meet the criteria for summoning, but this build runs 2 other Fields and is trying to grind with either/or. Dragon's Mirror is busted, and when things are going well the card is insane, but it is bad in multiples and the low-end Mirror makes very sad Sheous with no friends. Changeover is just the best Dragon Fusion support card in general, anyways.  So, for Rokkets, we have 2 Tracer, 1 Silverr, and 1 Magna. You can actually trigger the Magna and Silverr with Hieratic Seal or Borrelsword, which is nice, but the real reason for 2 searchable Rokkets off of Tracer is that they come up in the grind game, and that doing so enables more turn 1 Rokket combos. I'm also on 1 Quick Launch, and 1 Boot Sector Launch. This might seem weird, but remember, we only need access to 1 Tracer, and we're trying to get some more consistency in another way. I like this engine a lot, even if it isn't entirely necessary. One thing to note is that, while you can, and occasionally should, pop your own field spell with Tracer, it is often better just to leave it up for the threat of the grind game, whichever one you've ended on.  So, the main consistency for all of these combos comes with the weird little thing we're doing with the rest of the deck. Foolish Burial and Dragon Shrine are effectively copies of the same card you can activate on the same turn in this deck, and Ravine gives us a searchable third copy, with the downside/occasional upside of coming with a discard, and being easily searchable. Meanwhile, Nurse Dragonmaid revives Dragonmaids sent to the GY for value, Hospitality does the same but with a free send often attached, and Monster Reborn is a hyper generic card that also allows access to the dragons sent off the sending package, as does World Legacy Guardragon, at least for the purposes of summoning Rokkets and low-level Maids.  Lastly, we have 3 Tidying. We're really leaning on these and on the weird activation cost of Hieratic Seal to out floodgates and give us game against dump floodgate decks - we also need a lot of this card, since it'll be sent to the GY to enable the extension of plays, and since it is a stupid busted trap and a big part of the decks viability. It's the dumb trap you search out, but since often enough you'll have to search out a Fusion spell, you want to see this anyways.  This deck can put up pretty insane boards - Sheou + Seal is still your bread and butter, but you'll add a Savage to that often enough. Many hands get to choose between Sheou + Savage and Sheou + Seal. Some get to choose between Sheou or Savage + Seal. You'll also sometimes make God boards. You can also Otk, break boards fine, and grind like a mofo, and going for the Ravine / Reanimate route has opened up some truly insanely broken opening plays that may be better than Dragon Links best god boards in a world with Pisty but not Elpy. Also, Tidying is nuts."

You go second.  Also feel free to change whatever,Â  I'm no expert deck builder and have barely tested this  <strong>Card Choices</strong>  Jizukiru and Thunderking: Kaijus are core part to this deck's functionality.Â  Kaijus are not only great board breakers for this tower-building format, but they can also be used as material for Fallen of Albaz to Summon any Albaz Fusion Monster.Â  They can even be used with Monster Reborn to get easier OTKs.Â  Jizukiru and Thunderking as specifically good because they are LIGHT Monsters so they can be used as material for Albion the Branded Dragon, a Fusion Monster that just let's you summon another Fusion Monster!  Radian: Similar to Jizukiru and Thunderking but you can beat over this one and use it for material for Dragostapelia.  Albion the Shrouded Dragon: It both dumps a Albaz to the GY for your reborn spells and acts as an upstart goblin! He's also not a bad discard for albaz and can even be Summoned with Branded Bond, and used as material for Branded in White.  Pankratops: Excellent going 2nd tool for removal, can be either used as removal or extra damage for an OTK.  Thunder Dragon:Â  Deck thins, Provides discards for Albaz and Twin Twister, and can be used as a LIGHT material for Summoning Albion the Branded Dragon with Branded in White  Fallen of Albaz:Â  THE MASCOT HIMSELF <strong>ALBAZ</strong>!.Â  The reason for why this Deck even works is because Albaz outs large threats easily and turns them into powerful Fusion Monsters that you can use to beat your opponent to death!Â  Albaz is usually best paired with a kaiju so that you can guarantee a Fusion Monster.  Summoner Monk: The deck runs a fair amount of spells, especially ones that are prone to bricking so this is a great way of getting an Albaz.  Branded Bond: Great follow-up after dumping and albaz, extends/opens your OTK.Â  It's second effect even comes up sometimes, but it's rare.Â  You can float into it with Albion the Branded Dragon  Branded In White: Fantastic Extender for if you cannot Summon an Albion the Branded Dragon, and can be used to even open up situations where you cannot make a play. A good card to float into with Albion the Branded Dragon  Pot of Desires: Great consistency.Â  Pray that you don't banish all of your Albazes though.  Pot of Extravagance: Great consistency because Albaz targets are the only thing worth playing in this Deck's Extra Deck.Â  It does have some negative synergy with desires and Albion the Shrouded Dragon but you can always discard bricks.  Foolish Burial: Dumps Albaz, and sometimes maybe a big kaiju  Monster Reborn: Excellent extender, especially with all of your cards that dump Albaz in the Deck.  Harpie's Feather Duster: This Deck inherently has little answers to backrow so you want to run a good amount of backrow removal, and harpie's feather duster was the best  Twin Twister: 2nd best backrow removal, this deck has a lot of discard fuel as well  Cosmic Cyclone: 3rd best backrow removal.  Called by Grave: Negates handtraps and is very versitile, great card in almost every deck.  <strong>Extra Deck Card Choices</strong>  Predaplant Dragostapelia: He's not an Albaz Fusion but you can summon him with a Branded Albion or Branded in White.Â  He's great because he's basically a monster negate every turn.  Sprind the Irondash Dragon: He has some tricky materials if you don't use a kaiju specifically, but he does move and destroy cards every turn so he is pretty good if you can summon him. He floats into Albaz like most of the other Albaz Dragons.  Brigrand the Glory Dragon: Probably the least useful Fusion but he is still an Albaz Fusion.Â  His battle protection is pretty good but his targeting protection is pretty mid (as the kids say). He floats into Albaz like most of the other Albaz Dragons.  Titaniklad the Ash Dragon:Â  It's the best beater you got so you'll probably go into him often. He floats into Albaz like most of the other Albaz Dragons.  Albion the Branded Dragon: Hard to just summon with Albaz alone but he's definitely worth it.Â  He just allows you Summon another Fusion Monster upon being Summoned so you can get some pretty good beats going on.Â  He also has a unique and fantastic float effect where he adds/sets a ""Branded"" Spell/Trap from your deck (Which can be Branded in White for yet another Fusion Summon)  &nbsp;"

Well this is the de,"G'day everyone! I am back with a new deck list for everyone wanting to play a mostly pure ice barrier deck! Ice barrier since starting the game has been phenomenal to play, and i love to see people get dominated by it. Making it all the way to platinum using this deck beating out even the strongest of decks.  First off, we are going to start off with the basic strategies of this deck and move into the more complex ones.  Revealer is good. Revealer is great infact. if you get revealer on the board and it isn't negated, you have the whole deck as your oyster(pun intended(i like water decks)) Or atleast the tuners, as discarding for cost can be tricky, most of the time the best thing to do is to get the winds over the ice barrier into the graveyard to prepare for the next turn, bringing revealer back into your hand for round 2 Frost bite boogaloo. Sometimes you want to get one of your other ice barrier monsters in the grave so you can use Freezing chains of the monster reborn to quickly get it up for a combo, getting either zero dragon, White aura whale, White aura bihamut, crystal wing synchro dragon or just a plain ol' Stealth kragen.  basic two card combo is Revealer normal summoned, special summon either silent sea nettle, speaker for the ice barrier or general wayne if playing turn two and your opponent has a monster out. From there have two monsters on the field with possible outcomes being 2 level 4s or 1 level 4 and 1 level 5, you can decide what card you want to bring out with good ol' revealer's effect. Let me show you my thinking Going second and 2 or more cards on the field? and you have general wayne out? Hexa spirit of the ice barrier, use it's effect for level 2, synchro Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier out and banish those cards!  Going first? with 2 level 4s you have 3 options to go, You can use the effect of revealer bring out hexa spirit, make it level 2 using it's own effect, then summon coral dragon, with coral dragon out and a level 4 you are just one special summon away from big boy Bihumat himself! With 3300 Attack and 3000 defence, even if your opponent summons out dragoon, you can take it down with a brute force swing to it's head! Another option is to go for a Number 4: Stealth Kragen, this sets you up for a really early interrupt of your opponents plans by destroying any normal summon or pretty much anything really, non target, quick effect destroy with damage of half the attack ontop? sign me the fudgesickle up!  Now, are you going second, your revealer's effect has been interrupted, and you have a speaker for the ice barrier out, and not being locked to only summoning water monsters? Then here is the scary combo that got a lyrilusc card limited to 1. Ram your kragen into the enemy monster, summon out two spawns, with those two spawns, use them to XYZ summon into a utopic Future, then XYZ summon into Utopic Draco Future. i know right, Utopic Draco future in an Ice barrier deck?! You heard it here first! this is an amazing card and super easy to get out on your first turn!  We run the Mistar boy for a couple of reasons, when we get crackdown, and you have a stealth kragen up, you have only water monsters on the field. so link it away with a token generated by the effects of a speaker in the graveyard!  To get the crystal wing synchro dragon out is tricky. You need to be able to do it without locking yourself into water. the way to do that is to have speaker for the ice barrier and a hexa spirit. You start off by summoning the hexa spirit, then special summon the speaker, use effect of hexa spirit and send a level 3 to the grave, then synchro into gungnir, you may use the effect of gungnir if you have cards to spare, then use the freezing chains of the monster reborn, get that little hexa back out to then slap him to the grave with a fresh summon of the Crystal wing Synchro dragon!  If you are going second, and you want to mess your opponent up big time, you can! You need 3 cards with one more to discard. Revealer, Speaker and Wayne. if your oppoonent has a monster out, you can summon wayne, so Normal summon revealer, Special summon the speaker and wayne, search any spell you want from wayne, then you use the effects of Revealer. Get ou the little defender of the ice barrier or hexa spirit and discard warlock. XYZ summon Stealth Kragen with revealer and speaker. Synchro summon White aura whale with level 3 tuner and wayne, destroy their monsters in attack position and pierce the rest! You have 2 extra lives on the whale, so don't worry about him getting destroyed. Then turn after, if they haven't destroyed or they have destroyed the stealth kragen but you have 2 spawns, well guess what, you have a combo for the utpoic Draco future!  Silent sea nettle is a massive card, being able to return our defender for special summon for revealer, return the stealth kragen and spawns for a second sticky minion, and you have the ability to return any of the synchros except for crystal wing synchro dragon.  Here is the kicker. This deck sucks against a negate, not really if it stays on the field, like imperm, but if it is negated and destroyed, you have going to have a hard time getting everything back out without having a freezing chains in hand. Even then, it can be rough. I know it isn't easy, but i know you can do it, i know you can all power through!  Play around with the deck, i have tried to look at many different ways to improve it, and if you find any be sure to tell me, either message me on here, or jump into my stream Twitch.tv/Merlin_the  Thank you all for coming to my Yugi Talk"

While decking out is technically how you end games, games are decided by how often and how much cards you can draw with Spring of the Mysterune.  One popular variants of Mysterune is Magical Musket. From my playtest, I found them to be rather bricky, and draws with Muskets means no fuel for Spring of Mysterune. Additonally, lack of draws in Magical Musket means finding Mysterune spells to restart Spring of the Mysterune difficult. Live Twins, on the other hands, need far less garnets in deck to function, and the card draws from Ki-Sikil provide valuable chances to kickstart Spring of the Mysterune. In trading off the S/T negate from Magical Musket, Live Twin also provide non-targeting and non destruction removal, which out monsters that would otherwise need to be destroyed in battle, which the deck cannot do.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""Spring of the Mysterune"">Spring of the Mysterune</a>  The heart and soul of the deck. search it out with Point of the Mysterune, or Huginn, Wings of Mysterune and make sure it always triggers. Drawing 1 is crazy good, drawing 2 is horrid.  &nbsp;  Point of the Mysterune  ROTA of the deck. Use it to fill up the grave with extra spells, or use it after Spring of the Mysterune to round out your hands.  &nbsp;  Mysterune of Freezing Curse/ Mysterune of the Brilliant Flame/ Mysterune of Destruction  All Mysterune cards are OPT, so use these turn 1 to summon the fusion, since they are generally dead. But these are the cards you should hold on if possible for disruptions, but feel free to burn them during opponent's end phase to cycle cards and mill their decks.  &nbsp;  Mysterune of Slumber  You run 3 because this card is ALWAYS playable, so Spring of Mysterune can trigger.  &nbsp;  Mysterune of Disruption / Mysterune of the Golden Droplets / Mysterune of the Raging Storm  Additional names to summon Extra Deck monsters, Golden Droplets -&gt; Disruption mills 7 cards from the deck.  Raging storm can hit pretty high numbers too, but its value mostly derive from being a easy trigger for Spring of Mysterune, and being a finisher to mill the remaining 2-3 cards from the deck.  &nbsp;  Live Twin Lil-la/ Live Twin Ki-sikil / Live Twin Ki-sikil Frost  With Secret Password and Sunny's Snitch, there are 6 starters to find Trouble Sunny. Ki-Sikil Frost is not only a ext or ender, but the extra card draw she can provide goes a long way in accelerating your game plan. With Gigantic Splight, negating any Live Twin doesn't stop the play completely, as you can choose whether to get a draw or a pop next turn. Do keep in mind those lines of plays will open you up to Feather Duster or Lightning Storm, with Trouble Sunny, you can activate Trouble Sunny and summon Huginn, Wings of the Mysterune to protect your field spell instead.  &nbsp;  Secret Password / Sunny Snitch  Because of the heavy card draws in the deck, and the importance of keeping Spring of Mysterune engine running, running more copies of the Live Twin and their searchers can brick draws from Spring of the Mysterune.  &nbsp;  Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la / Forbidden Droplet  Cards that can out annoying cards that cannot be targeted or destroyed.  &nbsp;  Metalfoes Fusion  Good discard target for Huginn, pop it with Lil-La to get a draw. Generally a good card that soften the impacts of disruptions.  &nbsp;  Called By the Grave / Ash Blossom / Ghost Belle/ Upstart Goblin / Talents  Free slots in the deck. Talents is a second copy of Called By The Grave.  &nbsp;  Deceit of the Mysterune  It is a dead card going first and second. You only search this if you already have a field spell, or want to end the game quicker. In both of those cases, we are already winning, winning harder is whatever. However, drawing this when you are low on cards or going second is terrible.  &nbsp;  <img class="""" src=""Spring of Mysterune"" alt="""" />"

Virtual World is a very recursive deck, able to gain advantage by sending cards to the Graveyard, Banishing cards from the Graveyard, and is even able to recycle Banished cards. Chuche is an amazing card that helps the deck immensely, it is one of the only good removal cards that functions under both IO(Imperial Order) and Skill Drain, and is your main source of bringing back your Banished cards, alongside Shenshen. All of the Virtual World Gate Spells and Traps have good Graveyard effects which allow them to special summon(Xuanwu), add a Virtual World monster to hand(Qinglong), or change the Level/Rank of a Virtual World monster you control(Chuche)."

A lot of the deck locks you into Dark monsters from the Extra Deck, so I would recommend making Romulus quickly, as Dragon Ravine is a great card for any Dragon-based deck since it was first printed, or if you need to make a Halqifibrax combo to get started you should to it early in your turn.  Borrelend Dragon is a very strong card that just got printed in the TCG, as it cannot be destroyed by battle or card effect, nor can it be targeted, meaning that the only outs to it are a Kaiju monster or a non-targeting absorption effect, such as Underworld Goddess of the Closed Word, and by negating an Effect Monster, permanently, can simultaneously Special Summon a Rokket from the Graveyard.  Chaos Ruler is a very important card for this deck, and is fortunately a Dragon, as loading up the Graveyard is nothing but an advantage for this deck.  Overall, the deck is very strong, very consistent, and shows that it deserves to be considered a meta deck in this format."

It has Various cards to make XYZ summon of Rank 4 monsters. But the best it's Suships. Why? 'Cause SUSH,"<span>So you stumbled in this decklist? Well as the title says it was built for N/R Format that's why some good stuff was left out (Time Thief Redoer, Zeus, Utopia); this idea was created mainly 'cause I'm a Yataloked fan and I liked the Idea behind the Suship archetype being a XYZ SPAM deck, well when I was copying a Suship Deck for Ranked in Master Duel I noticed that the whole Suship Archetype it's R and N rarity (Well atleast the cards we have in Master Duel), so I decided to theorycraft making the deck. Sadly using the maximun amount of copies of the Main deck cards it only makes 30% of the main deck (12 cards) so to complete the deck I needed more engines to support the Suships. So turned to another archetype I like Time Thiefs being a good Engine to spam Rank 4 XYZ Monsters so they are good with Suships, I put 3 copies of the playable cards, but if you wish you can remove the Spell card is just for a little bit of swarming but if you don't have a Time Thief in hand it's a Brick (Like a hand full of Monarchs), I didn't put the traps because they're unplayable 'cause they all work in the Time Thief XYZ Monsters which all are SR and UR rarity so I can't use them for this format so althought you can use them they will be just bricks. With that we have 37.5% of main deck taken by Time Thiefs (15 cards), but we have another 13 cards left to fill the deck (32.5%). In N/R Format Handtraps are practically nonexisting, well at least good ones. So we have the following ones: Sphere Kuriboh, Battlin' Boxer Veil, Speedroid Menko, Battle Fader, Ghostrick Jack Frost, and Construction Train Signal Red, so the Deck it's a Rank 4 XYZ Spam Deck so Sphere Kuriboh isn't very good amking the attacking monster go to defense position (Which links are inmune to) and only useful in Ritual decks by being a Ritual Raven on steroids, Battle Fader has the better effect of the five but it's a level 1 so unless you want to use it for Link plays isn't very useful, oh and Ghostrick Jack Frost it's like Sphere Kuriboh which makes a enemy monster go to defense position and like Battle Fader he special summons himself so well isn't very useful in this deck, so we have left Battlin' Boxer Veil and Speedroid Menko which both are Level 4 that special summon themselves, Veil when you're receive damage which makes you recover it and Menko that will trigger when you're attacked directly and makes all your opponents monsters go to defense position (Except Link monsters 'cause they can't). I put 2 of Veil and Menko, and if you ask why not 3? Mainly 'cause in the last N/R Format Banlist they semi-limited both cards, well I think they semi-limited all of the Battle Handtraps available except Sphere Kuriboh 'cause it's so bad nobody used it.Â  So with Veil and Menko in the Deck (being 10% of the Deck) we have 9 spaces left for more cards. Looking for ideas I stumbled in the N/R Channel where they post possible engines, I found 2 engines for XYZ Decks and with that I could fill the deck. First engine it's Astraltopia and Numbers protection, Astraltopia it's a level 4 monster that can be special summoned from your hand when you have a XYZ monster in the field and when it's on the field you can send to the grave 1 card in your hand and add to your hand a Spell/Trap which says Zexal, ZW, Onomat, and/or Number in it's description, the other card it's Numbers protection which it's a Solemn Judgment but you don't pay LP but to activate it you need to have a XYZ Number Monster in the field to activate. I put 3 Astraltopia and 2 Numbers Protection. The other engine it's my old friends Sharks most of the engine it's low rarity you could play it (Expect a future Shark Deck for N/R Format) ok so I put two cards Right hand Shark and Left hand Shark. Right hand when it's Normal summoned you can add 1 Left hand Shark to the hand, and if you have Right hand Shark in the GY and you can Special summon it to the field for free if you don't have monsters in the field but it will get banish when it leaves the field (This lingering effect can be unable by using it for XYZ summon as material) it has another effect but it will never trigger in this deck, and now Left hand Shark this card can be Special summoned when you have Right hand on the field but it will get banished when it leaves the field and the other effect it's this card will become a Level 4 if it's Special summoned form the GY. So yeah this combo it's a Link 2 at best 'cause Left hand it's a Level 3. We have 2 Right hands and 1 Left hand. If you're doing math correctly you'll notice there's a free space 'cause right now we have 39 cards. Well I put a copy of Shard of Greed just in case it comes useful later. So there's the 40 Card List.</span>  <span>And now the Extradeck we have to put the XYZ Suship named </span><span>Gunkan Suship Ikura-class Dreadnought 'cause we are playing Suships it gets two different effects if it's summoned using the Main deck Suship monsters. If you use Shari (The Normal one) you draw 1 card, and if you use Ikura (The effect one) the XYZ can Attack 2 times this battle phase, which it's relevant to this XYZ 'cause when a Suship Extra Deck monster deals damage you can destroy one monster in your opponents field. We put 2 copies of this card, we could put 3, but for Space we put 2 mainly 'cause it's better when it's summoned by the Suship cards which we only have 6 in a 40 card deck. Due to the lack of good Rank 4 XYZ monster we could use the King of all of them Number 70: Malevolent Sin, well the king in N/R Format I know Time Thief Redoer exists, well why do I call him the king? 'Cause he's a really good monster to go into, there 3 options you could use in N/R Format, one it's Digital Bug Corebage which return to the deck one monster in you opponent's field which it's in defense position you could inmediatly go into this card when you summon Malevolent Sin, and sadly after you attacked with Malevolent you can't go into Corebage, the other two can only be used after Malevolent Sin has made it's second attack and they're Number 84 Paingainer and Number 77 Seven Sins. Paingainer has 0 ATK and DEF but it's gains DEF equal to the amount of Ranks of XYZ monsters in your field (It counts itself) X 200, so when you summon it, it has 2200 DEF, and when your opponent activates activates a Spell/Trap it inflicts 600 LP of Damage, once per turn you can detach 1 material and destroy all of your opponent's monsters with ATK lower/equal the amount of Defense that Pain Gainer has. Seven Sins it's a 4000 ATK and 3000 ATK Rank 12 XYZ monster, which's effect it's once per turn you can detach 2 materials and banish all of you opponents monsters that were special summoned, then you can atach to this card one of the monsters banished by this effect. And when this card would be destroyed by battle or card effect you can detach 1 material instead. So we put 3 copies of Malevolent sin and 1 of each of the monster I talked earlier (Corebage, Seven Sins and Pain Gainer), oh and if you ask how on earth i'm planning to put and enemy monster in defense position if we don't have any way to do that in the Main Deck, don't worry 'cause we have a solution for that, it's named Evilswarn Nightmare, it's a Rank 4 XYZ monster which requires 2 Level 4 Dark monsters which all our Time Thiefs are. He's effect it's when your opponent summons monster(s) you can detach one material and make them all go face down, which will make possible to special summon Corebage next turn and return one card to the deck, believe me it's a good combo well at least in this format. And 'cause we only use 1 copy of Corebage we only need to put 1 copy of Nightmare. So that's 9 cards we have 6 spaces left. 'Cause most of our cards are level 4 machines we can summon Heavy Armor Train Ironwolf which requires 2 level 4 machine monsters. He can detach 1 material and make 1 machine monster attack directly this turn (Which Ironwolf is) but he it's the only monster that could attack this turn, and when he's destroyed by your opponent you can add to your hand 1 level 4 Machine monster (Menko, Regulator, Bezel Ship, or Chronocorder. But to be honest if your field it's going to get wipe the best options are Regulator to make a comeback by making a XYZ Rank 4 monster or Menko for surviving another turn). Next, we have Number 57 Tri-head dust dragon, at first it seems like a bad card mainly 'cause to summon it you need 3 Level 4 cards which is rare in this deck but it could happen, so what this card does it's when it's summoned you can increase it's attack to the current attack of a opponent's monster on the field and by having 100 ATK it can get past the strongest card your opponent controls, it's other effect is detach 1 material and select an S/T zone in your opponent's zone which doesn't have a card in it, and while this card it's on the field face-up this zone can't be used, it's not the best effect but it can stop in it's tracks Pendulum and Giant Ballpark Decks. And now our last XYZ monster Number 50 Blackship of Corn, it's a Rank 4 XYZ monster which needs 2 level 4 monsters, it's effect it's to send to the GY 1 monster in your opponent's field which has ATK equal/less than Blackship (2100 ATK) and deals 1000 LP to your opponent, but this turn Blackship can't attack. And now our Link monsters and if you ask why are we using Link monsters in a XYZ deck it's mainly due to a certain card being avaliable in the format, don't sorry I'll say which card it is. The link monsters are Geonator Transverser, Codebreaker Virus Swordsman, and Doublebyte Dragon. Geonator it's used due to her effect to exchange two monsters in the field to the zones this card points to, so basically a Creature swap, it's due to this card you shouldn't put your most precious monsters in the left corner of the field or in the center. Virus it's used 'cause of his possibility to revive itself and being a Link 2 monster with 2300 ATK being the Link 2 with the biggest ATK stat in the game. And Doublebyte which can only be summoned by using 2 Link monsters, it gains 300 ATK for each level of Ranking that the cards used to summon it in this case if you summon it in this deck he will have 2700 ATK which yeah isn't much BUT he compensates by having a great effect which makes it inmune to monster effects and battle unless the effects or battle are from another Link monster. So yeah this little package it's a case of using fire to deal with fire.</span>  <span>Before I leave I want to suggest some options if you feel some cards aren't good to keep. In the Main deck deparment you can use cards like Photon Thrasher or Kagetokage which are special summons from the hand, XYZ Reborn to make a monster reborn of a XYZ monster in your graveyard, ZS Armed Sage ZS Ascended Sage which can be useful for more Level 4 monsters to make more XYZ monsters. You could replace the Time thief engine for Raidraptors or sharks that can be great engines for XYZ Rank 4 Decks, but Sharks are mainly used in pure water decks and Raidraptor can be good but most of them have to end in a Raidraptor XYZ and the available cards in the N/R Format don't make the deck justice. Some Dangers and Darkworlds could help the deck but it's a bit risky,. In the Extra Deck department you could use Firewall eXceed Dragon (Specially if you plan to use more Link monsters),Â  Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros for a Book of moon (Sadly the Quick effect it's only active if it has a Super Quantal card attached), Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk and Number 58: Burner Visor, to equip them to other XYZ monsters Berserk gives 1200 ATK and can use it's materials before equiping himself to another XYZ monster to banish 1 card of your opponent's GY (This effect it's not once per turn), and Visor gives the monster the possibility to do Direct attacks, Number 85: Crazy Box if you want to spice the game a bit and in the hypothetical case your opponent doesn't read Crazy box and Negates it's effect it's actually very good 'cause it turns this card into a 3000 ATK Beatstick, Gem-Knight Pearl just to have a 2600 ATK beatstick, Number 52: Diamond Crab King to have a 3000 ATK Beatstick of two uses and later a 3000 DEF wall if it manages to survive, Evilswarm Thanatos if you want a little towers monster, Gagaga Samurai to have a 1900 ATK monster that can attack two times. And for the Links well you have an abundance of monsters you could use.</span>  <span>Well I hope you like this deck. Maybe in the future I can edit this Deck and put in the Description a video in which I showcase this deck.Â </span>"

Previously, the deck did not have a lot of access to good Light Type monsters, until the Dogmatika archetype arrived. The Dogmatika monsters are a group of Light Spellcaster monsters that have abilities based on countering monsters summoned from the Extra Deck. Unfortunately, a lot of their cards lock you out of using the Extra Deck for a turn or two, so you have to be careful when you use them.  This deck is able to very easily run the engine for Destiny HERO-Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer(known as DPE for short), as it is an extremely powerful fusion monster, that gives any deck with the necessary space access to a strong monster that has a non-targeting destruction effect and can recur itself from the Graveyard each Standby Phase if it was destroyed, in addition to debuffing your opponents monsters."

Unfortunately, most of the cards are very xenophobic, locking you out of your Extra Deck except for Dark Dragon Synchro monsters specifically, which leaves very few out of archetype options.  The Boss Monster of the Deck is Red Supernova Dragon, which isn't too hard to bring out in this archetype, and has an immensely powerful effect to banish itself and ALL cards your opponent controls when your opponent attacks or activates a monster effect, and returns to the field during your next End Phase. Though it can't be destroyed by card effects, it is vulnerable to negation, such as Forbidden Droplet or Infinite Impermanence, or Tributing/Sending, such as Kaiju or Shaddoll Schism.  Sadly, the archetype isn't very good, as it is extremely weak to Handtraps, and has been powercrept in recent times, as other decks have a higher ceiling and a stronger board presence than Resonators can make, leaving it in the dust of Yusei Fudo and his Synchrons"

However, unlike Resonators, Synchrons are not very xenophobic, locking you into Synchro monsters from the Extra Deck, which isn't much of a restriction.  The center piece of the deck, and the primary Normal Summon, is Junk Synchron. Use this card for a free Junk Speeder, the ultimate target for an Ash Blossom and must be protected because of this, to gain immense advantage, summoning up to 5 different Synchron Tuner monsters(this deck only has 4 potential targets, but if Speeder is put in the Extra Monster Zone and you still have 5 targets able to be summoned in the Main Deck, you can summon all 5). After summoning Junk Speeder, your next priority is to make T.G. Hyper Librarian, as due to it not being once per turn, you can draw upwards of 5 cards during your 1st turn, to gain even more advantage.  This deck can also play the Majestic Stardust cards, but those make the deck worse in my opinion, though is does strengthen the end board potential."

The deck uses a Kaiju engine to generate elements on your opponent's side of the field and in your graveyard to special summon your extra deck monsters from Plunder Patroll. Effect Veiler and Skull Meister were chosen as the hand traps of choice due to their price and elements, as well as their ease of use so you can dump elements into your graveyard for Emblem of the Plunder Patroll to use for summoning monsters.

Or trying to ""hold"" going second with the hand traps, or if everything goes wrong with the droplet to ""break"" the field.  Undoubtedly the best starter on the deck is the regulator, as it offers you the best combo. If Tribute, bring two team thiefs from the main deck (usually the winder and adjuster), what you add with the winder depends a lot on the situation. Going, because if you don't have any move extender in hand, you can bring the chronocorder, because with the bunjinki effect you can make the redoer using it material. With the adjuster most of the time you will send the bezel ship to the cemetery. With this move you can end the turn with two xyz on the field, because with the effect of the bezel you can Special Summon it from the Graveyard by discarding a material and with that you can activate the effect of the redoer when banishing, detaching a monster from the effect. of the chrnoocorder is activated in the graveyard and it also enters by special summon. I recommend that it be with the redoer and it perpetuates it in the first game.  I put allure as a purchase option, because all time thief monsters are darkness, I also put Danger! As another option both to banish with allure, and the move extender itself. The skull meister is a good hand trap option because it is level 4 darkness (often it will be the ban target) it can also be used as material for the xyz. To protect the regulator I put the gamma, because you don't want to take an ash on it. XD In the extradeck I put some different level 4 options, you can change some things if you have any other preference.  I've used infinitrack on a few occasions, it's a really nice addition to the deck. If you have any questions, you can leave them in the comments.  Have fun with this good deck!"

With that in mind, the Main Deck ""Chronomaly"" cards that were playable (from many hours of play testing): 'Chronomaly Maoi, Chronomaly Maoi Carrier, Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket, and Chronomaly Esperanza Glyph'. 'Chronomaly Moai Carrier' has a watered down Cyber Dragon effect to Special Summon its self, while 'Chronomaly Maoi' can Summon its self when you control a ""Chronomaly"" monster. 'Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket' may not have a way to Special Summon its self or other ""Chronomaly"" cards; but, it does has a built-in 'Exrta-Foolish Burial' and 'Foolish Burial' on Normal or Special Summon, that can reduce the ATK of 1 targeted monster on the field. Finally 'Chronomaly Esperanza Glyph' may not be a monster, but it can take ""Chronomaly"" monsters from your hand, deck /or GY to Xyz Summon any ""Chronomaly"" monster with the corresponding Levels.

Card and Hand Destruction are used to make the mill easier to perform. Bone Tower can be brought out with the effect of Mezuki (and both can be sent to the graveyard using Yuki-Musume, Foolish Burial, Card/Hand Destruction, Gozuki, and Reasoning) while the Mayakashi setup can be brought out by searching for Hajun with Mayakashi Return or One for One.

This deck focuses around pendulum summoning to play high attack monsters and summon the signature card, Apoqliphort Towers, which has great utility and wonderful defense with its immunity to most monster effects, spells and traps. Pendulum abilities offer effective searching tools and a attack buff to your monsters.  The other main strategy of this deck is utilizing cards that negate monster effects. Most Qliphort monsters allow you to summon them without tribute summoning but with a lowered attack rating (usually to ~1800 atk). With the use of monster effect negation, this loss is reversed and you can easily summon monsters with 2000+ attack for free, especially with pendulum summoning. This will also negate the effect that states Qliphort monsters can only be used to special summon other Qliphort monsters if you plan to utilize an extra deck."

Though if you're in a pinch, Shuraig will be there to bail you out. ","Melffy cards a little ways away from displaying their true full decklist glory in Master Duel, but they'll still give you a run for your money. Bring along a menagerie of other funny fluffy and feathery friends to make a pretty funny deck. This isn't the end all be all to Melffy decks, and certainly not my only Melffy deck, but I wanted to put it out there.  An opening turn with 'Melffy of the Forest' with any mix of regular Melffys on the field is always a good start for this deck turn 1. Turn 2 starting, if they come out with a monster big on attack points, I like to introduce them to Sandayu (Ronin Racoon). If you have 'Missus Radiant' on the field or 'Solidarity' in play, most of the time you'll take their biggest monster and pop out a token with equal to their attack points <em>and then some</em>.  It's a fun deck to run with a lot of flexibility. Stall if you want to, summon the cards you want to, or shut down a card with the classic 'Melffy Puppy' into summoning Kalantosa. Pop! Unless they have something that protects their card, it's usually the end of the line for a lot of starting combos. Negate spell or monster effects with the Naturias if you know they'll be a problem. Have a free beast monster with Hasty Horse as long as there's no cards in the column. Pull out 3 fluffy friends on turn 1 with 'Obedience Schooled', and mix and match those into any number of Melffys or Racoons of your choice (You can use Sandayu more than once per turn; turn their 3000 attack monster into a 3800 attack token, then do it again for a 4600 attack token!)  If you need a card off the field, Alpha MoB can help you out with that, or he can be a potential fodder into Shuraig if you need him. (I will warn you though, read your card effects, you can't summon Shuraig the same turn you use 'Obedience Schooled')  You can easily mess with opponents on their turn. Pop their monster with the bread and butter. Or just stop them from attacking one of your Melffy's by bringing them to your hand. 'Melffy Fenny' into summoning Alpha is also always funny to do. After they summon a monster, use 'Melffy Catty' to add Hop Ear to your hand if you can't handle a monster or card effect. As long as it's their main phase, you can syncro summon right into 'Herald of the Arc Light'. Though, once the new Melffys get here, I may end up giving a thank-you to 'Hop Ear Squadron' and switching it out for the seal. Or when in doubt, 'Ayers Rock Sunrise' and 'Melffy Tag' will bring you enough monsters back from the graveyard to Xyz summon to your heart's content.  There's a lot more I could say about the Deck, like the flexibility of Alpha MoB with itself or returning a Melffy to the hand to proc the effect of 'Melffy of the Forest', or how well Melffys and Sandayu use the playhouse trap card. But I think it's best to let the gameplay speak for itself.  Mix and match more beast monsters if you'd like or even add other card archetypes to it. As long as there are Melffys there, any deck sure to keep your opponents guessing.  I'm Mezamizu, this is my Melffy, and thanks for reading!"

Branded combo: (keep in mind that if you activate Glow Up Bloom's effect, that you get locked into Zombies)  Activate Branded Fusion--&gt;Send Fallen of Albaz and Glow-up to make Lubellion (even if it gets negated, it discards for cost) -Otherwise, if you don't really need glow-up bloom, you can always send Mezuki/Gozuki or Banshee as a contingency plan (especially if you suspect they have a way of getting rid of your Zombie World).  Activate Glowup's effect in grave FIRST! <em>thenÂ </em>Lubellion (free discard btw ;) ) -- doing so will bypass the zombie requirement, allowing you to fusion summon Mirrorjade after you get Balerdroch.  Verte Anaconda is also a good way to get Branded fusion, but make sure to fusion summon Mirrorjade using Verte and Albaz because you get only one more special summon for the turn (DON'T SEND GLOW UP--YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ADD BALERDROCH TO HAND!)  &nbsp;  I also added in Jackalope and Tsuchinoko for added consistency so I can discard Glowup/Banshee/Mezuki etc. if I brick. Otherwise, you might be able to get into Halq if you get to special summon.  Here's what I banish for Prosperity: 1x Dragonecro, 1x Mirrorjade, both Phoenix link monsters, 1x Avendread, 1x Vampire Sucker. I usually am able to find branded fusion off of this when I don't draw into it.  &nbsp;  Your normal summon is gonna be Uni-zombie 70% of the time, but don't cry if it gets negated (which it WILL), really in a bo3 you can side in cards if you are struggling to make a good endboard. Otherwise, you can normal Gozuki to get 1 discard from the grave, which will be usually Banshee or glow-up.  VAMPIRE SUCKER BTW!!!  Vampire Sucker has an effect where you can tribute one of your opponent's monsters to tribute summon, so if you draw Balerdroch and don't have a normal summon/want to get Balderdroch for monster removal, you should probably go for it. I hadn't really considered this until recently, and it can catch your opponent offguard. (Disclaimer: DON'T GET GREEDY! Unless you REALLY think they don't have anything, don't special from their GY just for a free card draw. This really could just give them free link material if you don't get rid of it.)  I took Jackobolan out of my deck because I REALLY don't think it's that good considering I have Super Poly and Branded Fusion.  PS. I usually try to bait out negates with Foolish burial or even really Unizombie. Honestly, as long as you have Branded Fusion and a way to get Zombie World out on the field, you're probably good."

The impcantation engine is used to support your gishki monsters. This is a hard going second deck because using the effect of Gishki Zielgigas to draw on turn one is risky since the effect is mandatory. If you do have to go first be careful drawing with this effect as you can accidently bounce back your own monsters. If you use dark ruler no more make sure to keep a healthy amount of cards in hand to kill your opponent on your next turn. Don't use all of your fuel immediately. Ultimately this is probably not the best ritual archetype, but it makes big squids and it has really fun combos. :)"

Prohibit Snake is an excellent addition to any Codetalker deck; from your own hand, it sends your opponent's attacking monster back to <em>their</em> hand if it attacks any of your Codetalkers. Also: if Prohibit Snake is in your graveyard and you destroy an opponent's monster, you can banish a GY card and send another card back to your hand. This integrates nicely with chained effects, of which there are many in this deck.  An ideal set-up would be to end with an Accesscode Talker and another linked Codetalker on the field, and a Prohibit Snake in your hand. That protects your CTs from attacks (which Accesscode is otherwise <em>not</em> protected from), and gives you the opportunity to act on the offensive with Accesscode's effects.  &nbsp;  <strong>Your First Turn (Turn 1 or Turn 2)</strong>  - Summon Code Talker with Micro Coder in hand + field card, then search for Cynet Codec (if already in hand, instead search for Cynet Optimization or Conflict)  - Next: summon Transcode Talker with Code Talker + another card, preferably an in-hand summon card (e.g., Code Exporter). Special summon Eater of Millions if available.  - Next: revive Code Talker with Transcode Talker, and continue to link summon so long as you have in-hand summon cards. If Turn 1, end phase and wait until next turn to summon Accesscode Talker. If Turn 2, summon Accesscode Talker with Transcode Talker + field or in-hand card. Use Accesscode Talker effects to destroy opponent's cards and then attack.  &nbsp;  <strong>Your Second Turn (only if you started the game, Turn 3)</strong>  - Summon Accesscode Talker and see above.  &nbsp;"

Sign me up! ,"Konami has made a lot of female-based archetypes, but this is one of the only good ones.  The main mechanic of these draconic housekeepers is that the low-level maids tag out for their high-level counterparts(you can tell which is which by the element or their names, the big dragons are all anagrams of their small versions).  The Boss Monster of this archetype is Dragonmaid Sheou, a walking Omni-negate with 3500 ATK and the ability to special summon any other Dragonmaid from your hand or GY. It's omni-negate effect allows it to tag out to House Dragonmaid, its maid counterpart. House Dragonmaid can special summon a Dragonmaid from your hand or GY that is 1 level higher or lower than a Dragonmaid you control.  Cards like Dragon Ravine and Chaos Ruler, that dump cards to the GY, are very helpful for this deck, as their cards both have good GY effects and use the GY as a second hand."

Though their Main Deck monsters are primarily lackluster in power and effects, the true power of this archetype lies in the Extra Deck. The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la, respectively, can special summon the other if you control no other monsters, making them excellent starters, and the deck has a lot of ways to search them out in their archetypal Spells and Traps.  On your 1st turn, your goal is to summon E*T Ki-sikil first, special summon a Lil-la from your GY, then make E*T Lil-la, special summon E*T Ki-sikil from your GY to draw a card, you can then make either Trouble Sunny or Unchained Abomination depending on your preference or whether you go 1st or 2nd, or if you have Evil*Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, the Main Deck Boss Monster, in your hand or GY, you could make that as well.  The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la are Cyberse Type, their alternate cards, Frost and Treat are Aqua and Zombie, respectively, and their Extra Deck monsters and E*T Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la are Fiend Type, and most of them lock you into Fiend monsters from the Extra Deck. So thankfully, Unchained Abomination, the Boss Monster of the Unchained archetype, happens to work very well with the Live/Evil*Twins as it is also a Fiend."

A lot of the cards double up in utility, such as the jurracs being useable for both synchro and XYZ materials, with the extra deck functioning as a tool kit to deal with problems as they arise. Plenty of support-type monsters means the draw and summoning power is there (and hopefully consistent enough), with cards like Magical Mallet and the elemental dinosaurs fixing themselves so that there are (hopefully) no dead draws. The sideboard is designed to deal with any troublesome card archetypes that either get around destroy effects (such as hyper hammerhead) or monsters to come in handy in long games (such as Overtex Qoatlus). Feedback is appreciated, as I'm still pretty new to the game."

Master Duel: Chaos Spirit Charmer  Check out my YOUTUBE CHANNELS  The âCharmerâ, or known as the âSpirit Charmerâ is a standalone archetype of Spellcaster monster themed on controlling monsters with the same Attribute as them which is unfortunately not playable in any way without an exceptional support from another card. Surprisingly the new Archetype called âMagistusâ came out soon after the âSpirit Charmerâ was released in 2021. The âMagistusâ archetype had a perfect synergy for the âCharmersâ especially since they only rely on base from Attribute and Types. This deck is strong enough to be used in high Tier level on Master Duel or Tournaments(hopefully).... This build is very easy to obtain/play it and can be used for any newcomer duelist because most of the cards are actually straightforward for the combos which I already listed the key cards for anyone interested to play Charmer Deck.  &nbsp;  Start with only using 3 simple Key Cards which is the only best I ever come out with for the Full Charmer's combos.  &nbsp;  Just following the recommendation cards that are listed below.  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  [Key Cards]: 3 Main Engine  - <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>  - <a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a>  - <a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>  &nbsp;  [Recommend]Â to Search/Use  - <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer"">Lyna the Light Charmer</a> (Hand) &amp; <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> (Spell/Trap Zone)  - <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a> (Hand)  - <a data-name=""Artemis, the Magistus Moon MaidenÂ "">Artemis, the Magistus Moon MaidenÂ </a>(Spell/Trap Zone) = <a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a> (Hand)  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  Once you finally set up your cards. You will proceed with the next step by activating â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoiresâ"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoiresâ</a> effect to send out â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from your hand to the GY. Then use ""<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>"" effect to become Earth Attribute that allowed you to Summon â<a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">Awakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a>'' card from either hand or Deck by sending both â<a data-name=""Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires"">Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</a>â and â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â from the field to the GY, which make them to trigger of their effects by Chain Link 2 and bringing it back â<a data-name=""Lyna, the Light Charmer"">Lyna, the Light Charmer</a>â from the GY to the field along with â<a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>â by it own effect. Now you have finally had a chance to Summon â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â from either hand or Deck by its own effect. After that use â<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed Lyna</a>â effect to search out â<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>â from your Deck then add it to your hand which is the only best Spellcaster monster with 1500 DEF/Level 4/Light Attribute monster that can be able to search out by ""<a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Dharc"">Familiar-Possessed - Dharc</a>"" effect when it Summoned by it own effect.  &nbsp;  Reminder:Â Do not activate ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" effect during your turn when it Summoned to your field, it will disable you for summoning from the Exta Deck unless if you have too. (This is an Optional)  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  Tips: You might not actually get them from the opening hand with exactly cards. So I prefer you to try something else with different cards in your hand if one of the Key Cards are missing. You should better rely on your additional cards in your hand that might help you to set up your cards. Keep it in your mind that ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" is just an additional card to use <a data-name=""Familiar-Possessed - Lyna"">Familiar-Possessed - Lyna</a>'s Effect to search out ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>"" from your deck to the hand.  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  [Additional]Â for moreÂ Consistency  You can use ""<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>"" as additional for ""<a data-name=""Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame"">Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</a>"" or any Level 4 monster from your Deck like ""<a data-name=""Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre"">Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</a>"" or any Performage monster depending what card you need.  Requirement: 1 any Spell card, except ""<a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>"" card, if not, you can use it as well if you have too. I include â<a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a>â from my Deck Profile since It actually works very well for any Level 4 monster.  &nbsp;  ___________________________________________  &nbsp;  The End Board got changed frequently due to lack of cards since I actually used <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> lately in the actual game which is not my original plan for this deck. So I came up with the new play style by giving you more options to play either ""<a data-name=""Number 106: Giant Hand"">Number 106: Giant Hand</a>"" or summon any link 2 like ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>"" depending on any situation if you have more additional cards on your play to expand it.  &nbsp;  I want to try something new in Master Duel with different cards that I have so it got changed especially from the Extra Deck. You can still use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as usual to link summon â<a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a>â, ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>"" and/or <a data-name=""&quot;Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess&quot;"">""</a><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a><a data-name=""&quot;Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess&quot;"">""</a> during your opponent's turn. You can also add as many hand traps you want as long the key cards had three copies for each the following Recommendation.  Like &amp; Subscribe for more Videos  https://youtu.be/6_H_pc56WC8"

Another Dogmatika Deck? Yeah. Nothing too fancy too be honest.  The decks normal summons are incredibly important so be sure you are actually able to get those off. Spellbook is an amazing deck thinner and has access to a searchable Reborn and Fate. Dogmatika are the only monsters in the main board that can special summon themselves so try to set them up. The Invoked cards allows for another spellcaster source on top of being excellent support for fusion engines such as Shaddoll.  My hand for this deck is pretty consistent and as long as you don't get Ash'd or Droll'd you will be fine. As long as you start with either Spellbook Magician or Spellbook of Secrets you can start thinning out your deck and setting up Fate.  Typical turns for me are pretty much Spellbook Magician + Search Secret + Use Secret search for Spellbook of the Master (to copy Secret) if you have another Book in hand otherwise go for Knowledge. Next you have Magician Link into Artemis and use Knowledge to sac her for 2 cards. This will set up your gy for Maximus or Mechaba.

This deck can contend with the best of them and I have no doubt you can hit Diamond 1 with this list. I will say it will not be an easy road like playing drytron though. It will definitely be more satisfying. If you're like me who hates playing meta decks and love playing rogue lists and drawing a ton of cards you will like this deck. It is very expensive though but if you have all of the staple hand traps it should be too bad to build. I hope you all enjoyed the video!

This is a going second deck, you want to let your opponent set up and then clear their board with sphere mode/soul crossing.  Soul Crossing is the reason this deck works. It turns every god card into a sphere mode, except the monster starts out on your field immediately. Incidentally you can use it to summon Sphere Mode to your side of the field immediately and go straight into a 4000 Winged Dragon of Ra.  Pot of Extravagance and Prosperity are maxed out because other than Egyptian God Slime this deck doesn't use the extra deck at all, and we want to get to our combo pieces right away.  Ra's Disciple and Reactor Slime are the main way you can get 3 tribute fodder on the board. Reactor Slime also allows you to tribute it to set a Metal Reflect Slime directly from your deck.  Guardian slime and Metal Reflect Slime are the 2 cards used to bring out Egyptian God Slime, which can act as 3 tributes for the summon of a Divine monster, as well as being a respectable monster in its own right with 3000 atk/def and a redirection effect.  Ancient Chant and Thunderspeed Summon are how you're going to summon the god cards the same turn you get the materials on the field (other than Soul Crossing). Thunderspeed Summon also allows you to tribute summon on your opponents turn or during your battle phase. Ancient Chant lets you search for The Winged Dragon of Ra and gives you an extra tribute summon (you can summon a monster other than Ra if you want to). it also gives Ra an attack boost on summon, which is nice because you're normally bringing it out at 7900 making you just shy of an OTK.  Forbidden Droplet and Solemn Judgment are quality staples and I don't think I need to explain why they're good. Technically Judgment has negative synergy with Ra, but I think the negation is important. It's also the only Solemn that can be used after Ra resolves its effect."

First, you have to have the Synchro monster already on your field. Second, you have to draw the Assault Mode spell/trap. Third, you have to not have the Assault Mode card in your hand, as the original Assault Mode Activate, the searchable one, only summons from the deck.  These inherent flaws in the deck's strategy led to its immediate DoA(Dead on Arrival) status, but Legacy support for this archetype has made it a decent engine in some decks to cut down on minimum cards in deck, but I intend to use it for its original purpose, to actually summon an Assault Mode monster. And I will summon the best, and basically the only good, Assault Mode monster, Stardust Dragon(T.G. Halberd Cannon/Assault Mode isn't bad either).  To supplement the weaknesses of the Assault Mode archetype, I added the Brave/Adventurer Engine, giving the deck a stronger board presence, including an omni-negate, in addition to Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, and a consistent way to recur your cards."

The weakest main deck cards of IDS are in my opinion the shaddoll maindeck monsters, so why not cut them out and replace them with something better, that enables a plethora of new powerful fusion monsters. Also as far as I know, verte ignores branded fusion's locking effect, allowing you to use verte to send branded fusion and use its fusion effect even though you link summoned.  ""Why not 3 aluber?"" -me poor  ""Why no DPE?"" -see above and I think Fusion Destiny might get banned soon so I don't want to invest in it.  ""Why no pots or draw cards?"" -because I am a bad deck builder and don't fear god.  A card I am considering siding (or even possibly playing main deck) is incredible ecclesia, I feel going second this card could be great and it would be okay going first but it doesn't seem high-impact enough to justify its price tag, at least for branded stuff. In Swordsoul its probably justified.  You can do the usual IDS stuff to set up mechaba with schism to summon winda on your opponent's turn, as a matter of fact Winda is still going to be your wincon and as long as winda and the cards that enable her are legal, she will always be the wincon of this deck, despite being so hated. The difference is we have a better shaddoll fusion: branded fusion. Ghost Ogre, Effect Veiler, Nibiru, and all of our Dogmatika monsters are lights, which are fuel for Albion the Branded dragon, which can be used to go into Mirrorjade, Mechaba, Augoeides, probably more; I haven't sat down to do a lot of testing yet. With so many lights we can also run Despian Quaeritis as an extra deck option, but our space is tight so I didn't include it here. I chose to run Almiraj + Secure Guardna over just Artemis to ensure we have fodder for Maximus if we can get access to him. If we can get Maximus access, we have Winda access, and Winda is the wincon."

This archetype's playstyle revolves around summoning Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters. Now that this deck's name has been explained, onto the strategy!  &nbsp;  This Nibiru-proof deck actually has a Live Twin and Frog engine, and around 15 hand traps. So while you CAN go second, your strategy should be to go first and set up as many disruptions/negates as you can. Funny thing about Toadally Awesome, though. Its effect isn't a hard once-per-turn, so if you can pitch it to negate a card, and revive it on the same turn, you can use its negate again! As a matter of fact, you can revive it using Splight Elf's effect!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Orthros is just a good level 4 Tuner and serves as a decent Scale. Vice Typhoon is like a second Necro Slime, and can be sent straight to the GY by Copernicus, which is why I don't run something like Foolish Burial. Ragnarok is good for both the Scale effect and Monster effect. Zero Rage is the best scale in the deck, and stops you from taking damage by something like Ragnarok, Gilgamesh, or your Dark Contracts. </span>  <span>Extra Deck - 2 Ghengis, to either go into High King Caesar or to use for Synchro material, and also to chain summons from the GY. Oracle can help heal lost LP and can be used as Synchro material with Lamia to make Siegfried. Beowulf is just a good card in general, having a field-wide spell/trap wipe and gives your monsters piercing. Caesar Ragnarok can be replaced by Purple Armageddon, but both work, I just find Caesar Ragnaroks steal/equip effect more useful than destruction/burn. Both work well. Alexander is kinda just an extender and Synchro fodder. Siegfried is one of your best negates, being a quick-effect targeting negate. High King Ghengis is also a spell/trap negate. Baby Caesar can search for any Contract after leaving the field, and you can summon King Tell using Baby Caesar. Burn your opponent then use King Tell as Link fodder for Gilgamesh, then use King Tells effect. High King Caesar is probably the best negate in the deck, being a summon negate + destruction, even if it's in the hand. It's not once per turn, and is a quick effect. Basically, it's 2 mini Solemn Strikes that don't require LP to pay. Kali Yuga is the last thing you want to go into, as it shuts down everything else for the turn. Hes also got a spell/trap board wipe, and can also search any Dark Contract from the GY. Gilgamesh is the last card, and he carries a lot of the plays. Use him to get D/D's in the grave such as King Tell, use him to get the Pend scales you want, use him as fusion fodder, he just makes everything possible. </span>  <span>I'm using this in Master Duel, but this works in the TCG too I'm pretty sure. In fact it'd probably be better because of cards like Gryphon and Deus Machinex.</span>"

(Ft. Magistus)","Hello everybody!. As you may or may not know, months ago was released some support to the Witchcrafters archetype that is yet to arrive to the TCG, but we may as well start doing some recipes and experimentations beforehand.  Sadly, even though the new Witchcrafter Fusion Monster is a solid option to build a deck around, the Fusion Spell Card is really underwhelming (<strong>we are talking about a slow-searchable polymerization</strong>).Â so, i've been looking around the other spellcaster archetypes and found out that a Magistus package works wonders in this deck!.  <em><strong>What does the ""Magistus Package"" do exactly?.</strong></em>  Well i'm glad that you asked. Since there's no way to search out the Witchcrafter Fusion Spell without using <strong>PatronusÂ </strong>(<strong>Too slow for turn-one</strong>) this deck uses instead ""<strong>Magistus Invocation</strong>"" that can be searched out with ""<strong>Rilliona, the magistus of verre</strong>"" (<strong>Since her effects procs also when special summoned you can use ""Summoner Monk"" to search her out</strong>).  With this alone it makes the deck a lot more consistent and less dependant of Verte, but there's more!.  You may combo this with <strong>""Magicalized Fusion""</strong> to have both Aiwess and Vice-Master on the field. ""<strong>Magician Souls</strong>"" is also a great card in the deck, you can cycle your deck with it's draw effect, prepare graveyard for Magicalized Fusion, and even link it off to ""<strong>Artemis, the magistus moon maiden""Â </strong>andÂ <strong>THENÂ </strong>normal/special summon Rilliona to search out Crowley and do Magistus combos. [<strong>Zoroa is there to be SS from the deck with xyz Rilliona]</strong>  The best part of this deck is that depending on your opening hand you may go with a Witchcrafter-only play or a Magistus-only play, or even better, both of them at the same time!.  I truly believe that this version of the Witchcrafter deck (<strong>While being an actual Witchcrafter deck)Â </strong>is the one with the highest ceiling and consistency out of all that i've tried out. It may not be meta (not without some hand-traps) and tends to die out quickly with negations but it's able to pull off strong boards and consistent OTK potential (<strong>with any 2 monster you can link-climb into Accesscode Talker that along with Vice-Master makes 8000 points of damage on the board)</strong>  <em><strong>Updated 17/05/22Â </strong></em><strong>(Banlist):Â </strong>Now that verte is banned this deck lost it's way to get the fusion on the field in theÂ <strong>worst case scenario</strong>. I replaced verte for a second copy ofÂ <strong>Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden.</strong>"

This deck has insane recovery power and hand control as long as Dragon Ravine is on the field as it can search monsters like Dux and Senatus or send tuners to the grave or monsters that can special summon themselves from the grave such as Remus, Arma Gram, and Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms. Besides Dragon Ravine there are a variety of searchers and cards that can fill your grave or even special summon straight from the deck. Dragon Ravine itself has searchers and searchers for those searchers so you have a plan for anything. And that's the best thing about this deck, your never restricted to one combo and chokepoint.

Including Deus X-Krawler from just one Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-knight. Krawler Soma is just such a great card and it really makes the deck shine. Sol and Luna is also a great card. It can disrupt opponent's plays by putting their monsters face-down adn triggering your Krawler Flip effects. It can also along with World Legacy Pawns flip Krawlers face-up when opponent is targeting face down Krawlers with removal effects, triggering the Krawler monsters' special summoning effect. I decided to drop World Legacy in Shadow from the final build because it sometimes bricked and usually was just foing nothing except being a target for opponent's spell and trap removal. And nasty surprise fo people who don't read. Nibiru the Primal Being is an especially great card for this deck as it does not tribute face-down monsters. You can just wipe opponent's field with it while still maintaining face-down krawlers. Also opponent cannot really use nibiru on you for the same reason. On top of that it trigger's krawlers' special summon effects. Solemn Judgment is there to prevent feather duster, lightning storm, raigeki and nasty board wipe or negate monsters.</span>  <strong>https://youtu.be/TBz9Xh2LEEg</strong>  &nbsp;"

No questions asked  ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=u8SC25-8zN0&amp;t=762s )  So to Answer anyone's question on how far we (the players) can expand the everlasting length of the Branded-Despia Pantheon, this here is my mark. I have been playing Yu-Gi-Oh in all forms for over fifteen years, and to say the innovation of homebrew deckbuilding has been toppled by handtraps, generic staples, and banlist forged by incompetent corporate synicism is an understatement. Today I'm gonna challenge myself even further by making a collaboration of 4 different engines into one deck (5 if we are counting Branded, but turns out it was never a real engine at all). Turns out that even though the excessive milling was indeed the price to pay for Lightsworns, the addition of such isn't as bad as I thought.  For starters, what I first learnt from all this was the ease of getting both <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn </a>and almost all the necessary Fusion monsters needed to fulfill your board building adventures (such as <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a> ). Next comes the Chaos package; which (while not as big as intended) fits really well with both the Despia and Lightsworn engines with little problems (except for occasions to where you might need <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levaineer"">Chaos Dragon Levaineer</a>, and either <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a> or <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a>). Adventurer lineup for this deck is the normal lineup you would expect in just about any of the Adventurer-Despia builds since it's inception, and nothing has really changed regarding the lineup (until the release of the card, <a data-name=""Illegal Knight"">Illegal Knight</a> from the set, Dimension Force). Finally the addition of some notable spell cards for this variant which includes <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>, <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a>, and <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a>.  Now we go on to the Extra Deck, which I mentioned earlier has the intention of giving me the ease of accessing the monsters with little issues. First in foremost this gives two options of either going into <a data-name=""Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn</a> or <a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a>; and while both do their milling jobs at a rate where it doesn't drain your decks too badly. <a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a> can be a lot more situational at times (especially against other Despian or Branded players), while <a data-name=""Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva the Exalted Lightsworn</a> gives you a +1 for every Lightsworn milled from your deck (and can destroy cards on the field up to number of them milled if she is destroyed by battle or by card effect). Then where <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> comes in is that is searches a copy of <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> for a very up and coming fusion monster <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> (which requires 3 materials; but 1 from each your hand and field, and then you can draw/destroy cards up to the number of materials used from either side). Alongside that is the usual batch of Albaz Dragons commonly seen in most Branded builds with the addition of <a data-name=""Despia Quaeritis"">Despia Quaeritis</a> and <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade the Blazing Dragon</a> for the Despians.  Finally comes the link monsters that (while not making the most significant impact) still play a decent part in making some gains on both ends on the board. First and foremost we have the strongest of the elemental Chamers, <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> (played to snag Dark monsters from your opponents GY to use against them or to use them as fodder to fusion summoning with the Branded Dragons). Next in line is the familiar, but obscure Link-3 monster, <a data-name=""Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion"">Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion</a> (recovers a card from the GY if destroyed and is a foolish burial on it's summon; but if a card is sent to the GY by an effect, it mills 3 cards from your deck). Finally comes the aforementioned Link-1 monster <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> (which is just an extender piece that is currently used to get off of your Adventurer token into any of the other 2 Link monsters I already mentioned).  &nbsp;"

The current meta is easy pickings for blind second strategies, and Sky Striker is one fo the decks can make use of this style to its full potential.  When your opponent forces you to go 1st thinking all you do is spam ""Raigeki"" and ""Evenly Matched,"" metagame them by siding in devastating floodgates!  If your weakened opponent hasn't surrendered yet, clear the board with Raye's besties Accesscode Talker and Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer!  &nbsp;  And remember duelists... RAYE IS BAYE!!!  &nbsp;  If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!"

Get your cook (Number 59: Crooked Cook) out and wait for the Exodia pieces. While you wait for the Exodia pieces, you can use the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus for clearing opponent threats. The Metalfoes Fusion is in this deck for Summoner Monk fuel, and to give additional draws (since you constantly will have 7 or more cards in your hand at the end of your turn), while also being a wait to protect yourself from a deck out. (Alternatively use Marron if you are scared of decking out) The Summoner Monk is probably the weirdest card in this deck, since you can't make Crooked Cook with him and the Right-Hand Shark, but then it is a good thing Buzzsaw Shark is a Level 4. Just summon him, make Almiraj with the Summoner Monk, tribute that monster of for it's effect, (which does nothing) then summon Right-Hand Shark and lastly the Cook. Another thing to note about this deck is, it doesn't care about Maxx ""C"", or to be more precise does it not affect this deck's gameplan at all. The opponent can get 4 free draws, and we won't care. Ash Blossom and Effect Veiler are the big hand trap counters to this deck, so hit them with Called By The Grave and Crossout Designator. As for the Extra Deck. Well, just fill it up with the cards you think will counter you. You only need 1-3 Crooked Cooks, and 1-2 Salamangreat Almirajs. The rest of the space can be used to whatever.  As for the weaknesses for this deck. There are a lot, but bricking is happily not one of them. (the deck has 13 cards that lead to cook, so that gives you a 10% chance of bricking) Kaijus are the biggest counter to this deck. A single Kaiju will make you forfeit, since you have no counter to it. Piercing and direct attacks are another big one, but the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus should help somewhat with those.  As for the matchups, we have Toons, Prank Kids and Blue-Eyes Max builds as the worst. The only thing stopping a Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon in this deck is a Kaiju, but you will still take 7600 HP damage from a single attack, so you only get 1 turn to draw the Kaiju, if it is not already in your hand. On the other hand, does some decks not have a single out for this deck. I am talking about Drytron, Adamancipators, Virtual World esc.  As for a funny idea. I worked a bit on this myself, but found Exodia to be better. Final Countdown is another great win condition for this kind of deck. Crooked Cook is all about stalling, and why not let the 20 turns for Final Countdown tick down while you stall. You will only give your opponent 20 turns to find a counter, but most meta decks will have fount their counter within 5-10 turns, so your choice. If you chose to pick Final Countdown, will i recommend removing Metalfoes Fusion and possibly Summoner Monk, since you won't need the draw power anymore, and Summoner Monk becomes somewhat less useful without the Metalfoes Fusion. (Swap Summoner Monk out with Silent Angler and you won't feel a difference)"

Borrelend Dragon, the Boss Monster of the Deck, is a very strong card that just got printed in the TCG, and is not yet available in Master Duel as of right now, as it cannot be destroyed by battle or card effect, nor can it be targeted, meaning that the only outs to it are a Kaiju monster or a non-targeting absorption effect, such as Underworld Goddess of the Closed Word, and by negating an Effect Monster, permanently, can simultaneously Special Summon a Rokket from the Graveyard.  A lot of cards in the deck lock you into Dark monsters from the Extra Deck, so I would recommend making Romulus quickly, as Dragon Ravine is a great card for any Dragon-based deck since it was first printed, or if you need to make a Halqifibrax combo to get started you should to it early in your turn.  Chaos Ruler is a very important card for this deck, and is fortunately a Dragon, as loading up the Graveyard is nothing but an advantage for this deck.  For the decklist, we have a Rokket package of 1x Absorouter, 2x Tracer, 1x Synchron, 1x Boot Sector, 3x Quick Launch, 1x Borreload Savage, 1x Borrelend, 3x Striker. A typical Chaos package for Dragon Link in 2x Collapserpent, 2x Wyverburster, 3x Starliege, 3x Chaos Space, and 1x Chaos Ruler. Standard Dragon support cards in 3x Noctovision, 1x Chamber and 2x Tidying(for a small Dragonmaid package), 1x Romulus and 1x Dragon Ravine, and 1x Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. We have 3x Ash Blossom, 2x Ghost Belle, 3x Maxx C, and 2x Veiler for Handtraps, 2x Called by the Gravefor Anti-Handtraps, 1x Destrudo and 1x Shooting Riser, 1x Dragon Buster and 1x Union Carrier(Because this card is somehow not banned yet in MD), 1x Avarice, 1x Underworld Goddess, 1x Triple Burst, 1x Accesscode, 1x Halqifibrax, and 1x Hieratic Spheres.  Overall, the deck is very strong, very consistent, and shows that it deserves to be considered a meta deck in this format."

It's a really aggressive and oppressive deck if able to set up correctly, which shouldn't be a problem. Anyway, the list. Also, I'll just discuss the cards that need explanation and not the entire details of the list because, they should already be pretty understandable. Also I'm only playing 3 Alubers because I can, if there's a better option for this slot, I would cut one for a room.</span>  <span><strong>The only tech option that I will discuss today is this:</strong></span>  <span>â¢ <strong><a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a></strong> - <span>In my Darklord Despia Shaddolls list (if I was already able to post it here), this was Shaddoll Fusion and Shaddoll monsters as targets. But basically, it's just Branded Fusion at home. This is not a new tech choice for Darklords/Despias, in fact I've just been tinkering with this but haven't played the game due to how unfun it is. Normal Summon her, bin either Kristya, Lancea, or Scythe to the GY with her effect, then make The First Darklord. Speaking of which, the targets:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a></strong> - <span>It's a floodgate that prevents Special Summoning, and thanks to The First Darklord, it cannot be <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>-d.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a></strong> - <span>It's, again, a floodgate that prevents Special Summoning, although its effect has to be activated, but who cares. The First Darklord's effect prevents it from being targeted.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></strong> - <span>It's another free floodgate that prevents banishing for the turn. If you have access to this and Artifact Scythe or Kristya, then it's a guaranteed win unless they specifically have <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>If you can set up Scythe and Kristya in the GY going first, you already pretty much won the game. Also Konami, Ad Libitum of Despia where? An actual ban list where? Side decking where? OCG omegalul, uhh... Best of 1 format bad, what else... Can't wait for Normal Summon Aleister festival, bottom text, YEP. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>  <span>Edit: This list now also includes the DPE engine, a minor increase in ratio to fit certain tech options to adapt to the changes like Greater Polymerization.</span>"

Here's a Pendulum player's best attempt.</span></strong></span></p> <strong>Overview:</strong>  <span>Endymagician as an archetype is all about board control, whether it be through monster, spell, or omni negates, big bodies, or protection. Using its mechanic of Spell counters as a resource, and using Magician support as half the deck to allow for an explosive, versatile extra deck, full of outs to almost anything, or O/FTK potential to weak boards. All this said, the deck is relatively weak to certain hand traps, moreso than some other pendulum decks thanks to Maxx C, and properly evaluating the absolute value of every card is a must.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Key Cards/Combos:</strong>  <span>HARMONIZING IS GOATED. This card as long as you have scales, is basically a Baronne for free, able to special summon any magician from your deck. Oafdragon for Baronne, anyone else for your rank 4 Xyzs and Lvl 8 Synchros. Alternatively, she can pull out anything for your Electrum engine.</span>  <span>ASTROGRAPH IS GOATED. Kind of a garnet if drawn, but if you're at all familiar with this card, you'll know why. But to put it simply, it makes the Electrum engine work. </span>  <span>Electrum, put Astro to the extra deck, Electrum effect, destroy something perishable, Astro to the hand, Astro effect summons him, puts thing you destroyed to hand (if theres another copy in the deck) Link out Selene using Electrum and anything you want, typically Astro, Selene effect, Link out I:P if you have the monsters, Link out Avram or Access depending on board with I:P + Selene.</span>  <span>Endymion has the longest card text in YuGiOh, so here's an unofficial errata: in the P-zone he is an 8 scale that can take 6 spell counters from your side of the field to special summon him out, if you do this you can destroy cards equal to the number of cards that may have spell counters on them (you MUST destroy atleast one card.) and while he's a monster, he's a spell negate! the cost for the negate is to return a card that has spell counters on it to the hand, but once you do, those spell counters get put on Endymion himself. (yes he can target himself to be bounced if you need) and this is of course once per turn. Once he has spell counters on him, he gains target and destruction protection from card effects, and if he dies, he's a normal spell tutor. He kind of does alot.</span>  <span>Jackal King is a monster negate as long as you have 2 spell counters somewhere, and he gains 2 spell counters for every spell played, not just one. Kiiiiinda really useful~</span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Conclusion:</strong>  <span>This was my first deck in Master Duel, and YuGiOh as a whole, so its kind of special to me personally, but its of course far from perfect, you will need to faf about with it a bit depending on what you like or need in your collection of archetypes. I come from Magic and Hearthstone, so Value/Control decks are some of my favourites, i tried to give this deck high value options for such a reason. If you have questions just ask, ill happily try my best to give you a proper answer ^-^ &lt;3</span>  &nbsp;  <span>I occasionally do Master Duel on my YT too~ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGuaotx691PPQgCnSS-jrdg</span>"

Spam link summons with the kuribohs. It is also easy to make a 6 material ZEUS.,"You want to get a level 5 monster on the field so that you can activate five-star twilight, which summons a bunch of kuriboh monsters to the field. The deck utilizes kuriboh support to either make this happen, or make it summon a ton of tokens onto the field instead with multiply. The idea is to spam into link summons so that you can have a full board of effects. Depending on the situation, it is also possible to make ZEUS with 6 material by using Lyrilusc's effect. A 5 card Albaz engine is added, mostly to keep the deck cheaper, but these can be replaced with staple cards like Accesscode, Apollousa, and Dragoon, which I reccommend as Albaz does not flow well with the deck."

Paired up with the Legendary Fisherman support card Sea Stealth Attack, you can protect your spell/traps by remove your own token when you opponent activates an effect. Since the field spell activates on a new chain, both conditions for its activation 1. your opponent activates an effect and 2. you not controling a token *when it is able to activate.* That is why I also run Spiritual Water Art - Aoi as well as getting hand information and disruption. But being able to search archetypal cards is nothing to *what* the cards are you're searching. Both Phantasm Spiral Battle and Phantasm Spiral Power are the best search targets in a more controlling type of build. From-hand targeted destructions with Battleare still nice, and effect negation/attack lowering of power is arguably better. I like to think of it as a searchable Effect Veiler that can be used at any point of the turn, on either player's turn, includimg the damage step because of the stat point modulation. The equip spells are good ways to turbo out the 2900/2900 big chungus from almost everywhere as well as providing nice piercing, burn damage, or more discard against your opponent. This build is very enemic and made to be a budget Master Duel list. Includes to beef it up are a playset of Fossil Dig to search Megalosmasher X, the card Heat Wave to lock both of you (but mainly your opponent) from summoning effect monsters, and Card of Demise to dig further for your key cards of the field spell and either Sea Stealth Attack or a normal summon."

And to that I say: ""There are other Light Warrior themed decks?""  I have always tried to make some sort of deck that used Poker Knights with something else that is nice. And that is where Heroics come into play.  Your main goal with this deck is to swarm the field to go into Extra Deck plays via Poker Knights or Heroics.  The Pokers are the Base of this deck, seeing as most of their support is here, which act as the metaphorical sterring wheel to the burning car that is this deck. Heroics are the Extenders, because the rest of their Archetype are don't wanna work or are bad (usually both), which can enable more Extra Deck shenanigans for you. Puppet Pawn is here for one reason only and that is Fusion Fodder but I'll explain later. BLS is here because Queen's Knight exists and by god does the new BLS work wonders here (Well... about as many wonders as BLS can make).  Isolde, which is basically in every Warrior deck now, should ALWAYS search BLS (or fucken whatever if you already have the blue brick menace in your grubby little hands) on link summon and use the equip spell to get Knuckle Knife out there. Jarngreipr is there for protection against basically most threats. Arcana Extra Joker is there to help negate things and enable a potential comeback on death (unless you get cucked by negates yourself). Tenyi is there in case the heart of the cards is a dick. Starliege for when you cuck yourself via Joker's Straight. Constellar for the rare occasion that you land on Jack's Knight and Knukle Knife. Arcana Knight Joker exists in there if you need to beat over something and Gilti-Gearfried because you are using two different Attributes and he is a good card.  So the Strategy: Face Card Fusion should 9 times out of 10 be used to get Gilti-Gearfried out with any Poker Knight (preferably from your hand) and Puppet Pawn (preferably form your deck). Then you can banisch the Pawn form your GY to get any EARTH Warrior (so basically the heroics) from your deck into your hand. Morning Star searches Envoy, Envoy searches Knuckle Knife and with him you can either go for Link or Jarngreipr and use his effect and extend play ad nauseum. BLS can be used on your second turn to get a Ritual Spell and summon him in order to STORM THE GATES. Note: Depending on the Situation you can use Advand Ritual Art instead of Super Soldier Ritual if you fancy it.  You also don't have to worry too much about getting cucked since a good handful of Poker support recycles itself with the base trio.  In conclusion: Deck is good. Play. Pls."

Get your cook (Number 59: Crooked Cook) out and wait for the Final Countdown clock to tick down. While you wait for the Final Countdown, you can use the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus for clearing opponent threats. You only draw about 10 times after activating Final Countdown, so I don't expect to lose to deck out, but if you are scared of that, then just add a Marron. The Summoner Monk is probably the weirdest card in this deck, since you can't make Crooked Cook with him and the Right-Hand Shark, but then it is a good thing Buzzsaw Shark is a Level 4. Just summon Monk, summon Buzzsaw Shark from deck, make Almiraj with the Monk, tribute that monster of for it's effect, (which does nothing this time) then summon Right-Hand Shark and lastly the Cook. Another thing to note about this deck is, it doesn't care about Maxx ""C"", or to be more precise does a Maxx ""C"" not affect this deck's gameplan at all. The opponent can get 4 free draws, and we won't care. Ash Blossom and Effect Veiler are the big hand trap counters to this deck, so hit them with Called By The Grave and Crossout Designator. As for the Extra Deck. Well, just fill it up with the cards you think will counter you. You only need 1-3 Crooked Cooks, and 1-2 Salamangreat Almirajs. The rest of the space can be used to whatever.  As for the weaknesses for this deck. There are a lot, but bricking is happily not one of them. (the deck has 13 cards that lead to cook, so that gives you a 10% chance of bricking) Kaijus are the biggest counter to this deck. A single Kaiju will make you forfeit, since you have no counter to it. Piercing and direct attacks are another big one, but the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus should help somewhat with those.  As for the matchups, we have Toons, Prank Kids and Blue-Eyes Max builds as the worst. The only thing stopping a Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon in this deck is a Kaiju, but you will still take 7600 HP damage from a single attack, so you will probably be long dead before being able to use the Kaiju. On the other hand, does some decks not have a single out for this deck. I am talking about Drytron, Adamancipators, Virtual World esc. on the pretext that you are going first."

I even proved Youtubers  (I kinda needed to say that let's head into card explanation)  <hr />  MONSTER CARDS  1x Albion, the shrouded dragon: you can send any branded from deck or hand to GY to use these cards affect most of the time we send branded retribution to add branded spell/trap from GY to our hand, but you can also send branded opening to protect your fusion monsters, one of the important effects of this card is if you send branded card from your hand you can SP this card from hand or GY and it will treat as fallen of Albaz which is really becoming handi the times you summon Albion and dragoon you can sp this card and go into Alba-Lenatus and in end phase add or set branded spell/traps which in this kinda case I set branded separation.  1x: Ad Libitun of Despia: if you use this card for the fusion summon you can sp 1Despai or 1 fusion monster which is banished or in GY which is broken.  The reason for not using Dramature of Despia is that the card only gives you free negate which is not useful 60% time so logic says it needs to get removed but if you are a new Albaz player you need to play Dramature instead of Ad libitum ( this is for starters only )  3x Aluber the jester of Despia: the only thing gonna say about this card is you can't use both effects at the same turn so be careful full you can also sp this card by the effect of branded opening to add any branded spell/trap from deck to your hand.  2x Fallen of Albaz: people usually say 2 copies are extenders yes it's actually is but not for starters if you are a starter play 3 copies of Albaz, if this card is ns or sp you can use only this card and cards your opponent controls for fusion summoning, if you dealing with dragon boards you only need to set this card and summon Alba-Lenatus :)  2x the Springans Kitt: this card at 2 copies is all enough ( you can't do anything with 1 copy ), one of the important effects of this card is you can even branded spell/trap which is banished or in GY which makes this card more OP but you have to replace one card from hand to your deck ( fair enough cost ), well after you used branded retribution and kinda wast all fallen of Albaz monsters in extra you gonna add branded retribution by kitt's effect to bring those resources back.  1X incredible Ecclesia: this card can be free to waste your opponent negates also you can add this card from GY to hand if a fusion monster is sent to GY. basically, one copy is needed ( we don't want to make Albaz angry XD)  1x goddess with the third eye: why not another famous card reason is our field spell if fairy leaves the field you get to sp level 8 or higher fusions from GY, you might say but this card is getting banished at the End, yes but you sp with branded separation.  1x Tri-brigade Mercouier: the only thing that I'm going to say is if you banish this card with Albion you can add one card list fallen of Albaz.  2x Despian Tragedy: if this card is sent to GY or banish you can add one Despia monster to your hand, I prefer to send this card to GY, cuz this card sets you branded spell/trap from GY, also sometimes when you have enough back up you don't need to use this card effect when you sent to GY, cuz in that case if you discard the branded card you can set it that turn ( you can only use one of the effects of this card ).  Break time.....  <hr />  2x AshÂ  1x droll 2x Ghost belle ( this deck can use a max 8 hand traps) .it's up to you, playing more hand traps doesn't make a player better.  <hr />  SPELL CARDS  3x branded fusion: the only card you might want to see in hand it also locks you into fusions.  3x Branded Opening: discard 1 card and sp one Despia monster or add it to your hand, it also locks you into fusions.  1x Despia, the theater of Branded: fusion summon by using monsters on the field or hand you can't fusion summon lower than level 8.  1x Branded in Red + 1x Branded in white: these 2 together work amazing 2 branded in red doesn't make you play better ( being quick play spell isn't good at 100% times ), sometimes branded in white is more needed than the Red one.  1x Branded lost: this card is broken, if you fusion summon you can add one card that lists fallen of Albaz, also fusion monsters can not be targeted it ( basically the reason why Titaniklad is not in the extra deck )  1x Foolish Burial: you can send Tragedy to GY, and you know the rest, the reason why we playing 2 Tragedy is cuz sometimes you draw the only one you have but the tragedy at 2 is all enough.  2x Dark ruler no more + 1x droplet: you asking why 2 rulers and 1 droplet well you will understand if you face with Floowanereeze.  2x Super poly: why not 3 due we got our 3rd super poly and it is Branded Exile.  1x Called by grave + 1x Crossout  <hr />  TRAP CARDS  1x Branded Separation: this card is the most OP card in the deck, you can tribute one fusion monster or 1 fallen of Albaz fusion monster and sp 2 cards from both players banished zone or GY to your field ( imagine you tribute Mirror jade after you used and sp Albaz and another Mirror jade and you can Sp free card from opponent GY &lt; Majestic dragon anyone, totally awesome anyone &gt; yup this card is OP ).  1x Branded Exile: sp 1 Despian monster or 1 fusion monster and fusion summon by using both fields, fusion Materials will get banished ( time to banish Destiny HERO plasma or Dark Law XD ).  1x Branded Retribution: banish this card from GY, add one branded card from GY to hand, and also it's back when you wasted your resources ( explained in Albion the shrouded dragon and the Springans Kitt ).  Break time.....  <hr />  EXTRA DECK  1x Chimera: draw and pop what is better than this ( be targetable part since we don't have real poly is sad YOLO ).  1x Red-eyes Dark Dragoon: we all know this card so  2xMirror jade: you can only control 1 mirror jade on the field.  1x Starving Venom fusion: people forget this card's second effect and still wonder why you can target one level 5 or higher copy the effect which is really hard to deal with you copy Baronne if they negate their board goes bye-bye.  1x Predaplant Dragostapelia: free negate since we playing &lt;there can be only one&gt;.  1x Lubellion the searing dragon: send any dark monster with Albaz, like Tragedy or Albion the shrouded dragon, and sp this and sp one level 8 or lower fusion monster.  1x Alba-Lenatus the abyss dragon: this card is broken explained all in Albion the shrouded dragon.  1x Despian Quaeritis: reduce all monster attacks to zero except level 8 or higher fusions, if this card leaves the field cuz of opponent cards you can sp Fallen of Albaz or 1 Despian monster from your deck.  1x Sprind the iron dash dragon: we usually use it to send it to GY, who knows might be an sp target then we add Springans Kitt with it during the end phase.  2x Masquerade the blazing dragon: due to burn damage, so go brrrrrrrr  2x Albion, the branded dragon: send goddess with the third eye and Albaz to sp dragoon, and you know the rest so  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda: of course to summon mirror jade at least becomes handi  <hr />  Finally last part  SIDE DECK  2x Token collector: we are all tired of the brave token ( when become brave again, and why ??)  1x Harpie feather duster + 1x Twin twister + 1x Red reboot: Eldilich cry much you can :)  1x Necro banshee + 1x Zombie world: the best lockdown against many decks, including our bird friends  1x Mudragon: just target for super poly  2x droll and lock bird: well another way to stop Floowanereeze under Dimensional Shifter.  2x Triple Tactics Talent: you side when you go first  1x Nibiru: a cross out the target and also a good hand trap due  2x there can be only one: actually, since this deck might be only best to play this trap you can play 3 copies including one copy in the deck instead of the forbidden droplet.  IT'S OVER.  <hr />  Big thanks if you read it till here, again this was my best deck, but deep down its duelist itself makes the deck better, this deck is one of AGGRO decks which means you can't learn this deck by watching Combos cuz it makes you be weaker, actually this was a problem when tri-brigades came out some people didn't know how this deck can be meta or same works with Prank-Kids so practice Branded deck on your own way and get better. big thanks again everyone see you in the next decklist, which might be a Mixed Libromancer deck.

Use Snake Rain or Ogdoadic monsters to send each other to GY.  Keurse must be sent to the GY at all costs as it's main combo starter. Send it from Deck with Nauya or Rain or from hand with Ramifications, Rain or Zohah.  Here is how it goes with just Nunu and any other Reptile in your hand (Ipiria, Vennominon, Medusa...) and opponent doesn't open handtrap.  Use Nunu to send Zohah, and retrieve it by discarding anything (better if it's Reptile).  Summon King of the Feral Imps with Nunu and Zohah.  Search for NauyaÂ  if you didn't have it in your hand to send Keurse to the GY if its not there already or for Nunu to fill GY with other Reptiles so you have 5 with different names.  Keurse sends King of Feral Imp to GY and revives Nauya which searches Lily.  Lily sends Reptilianne Coatl and revives it.  Synchro Summon Geomathmech Magma then Synchro Summon Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin in Extra Monster Zone.  Use effect to Summon tokens on both sides.  Link Summon Reprodocus using Synchro and 1 Token that's either in center or far left or far right monster zone.  Reprodocus must point to token on your side from either Extra Monster Zone you summon it to.  Use effect and declare change type to Reptile.  Use 2 tokens to summon Reptilianne Echidna under Reprodocus.  Use last 2 tokens to summon I:P Masquerena next to Echidna.  Use Reprodocus and Masquerena to Summon Avramax to the extra monster zone.  Search 5 with Echidna, Scylla, Nyamini, Coatl, Lamia and Black Mamba.  Use Coatl to SS itself and Lamia, Scylla and Nyamini.  Link away Echidna and Nyamini into Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll.  Revive Nyamini.  Synchro Summon Hydra with Coatl and Nyamini and draw 5 cards.  Synchro Summon Melusine with Hydra and Lamia.  Special Summon Black Mamba.  Link Summon Alien Shocktrooper with Mamba and Scylla.  Set traps you got from draws, or activate Ogdoadic Continious Spell if you got it.  If you got Arasia and have Vennominon in your GY, SS Arasia and equip Vennominon.  With Trap Trick, Heavy Storm Duster or opponent's S/T Removal you can easily summon Vennominaga the following turn, protected by Avramax and Alien Links that can stun, combine it with Melusine and Recoil and your opponent will watch as their monsters change sides or as their ATK turns to 0.  Even if opponent uses handtrap and stops your combo you can still make Melusine and defend yourself with traps for a turn so you have enough Reptiles in GY for Vennominon to sweep."

(95% of the time you can summon Blue-eye Chaos Max Dragon in your first turn)  There's some other combo that could be used, like summoning borrelsword dragon using scapegoat and I:P Masquerena  Another combo it's using only the white stone of the ancients and summoning linkuriboh and in the end phase the Blue-eyes white dragon (this comboÂ  has to be used only in extreme bad hand)  In the deck i've added some card to negate summoning and effects: like the solemns card, infinite impermanence, called by the grave and Ash blossom"

Either inflict 8000 damage with Watts or break the board enough to get a Mystic Mine out. This deck can easily OTK without removing Mystic Mine from the field, and Mystic Mine can allow you to use the high-risk Left Arm Offering.  3 card OTKs: <ul>  	<li>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber + Honest/Leeching The Light/Instant Fusion + Wattsquirrel/Wattwoodpecker/Wattrain</li> </ul> 4 card OTKs: <ul>  	<li>Kaiju + Wattsquirrel/Wattwoodpecker + Leeching The Light + Wattkey/Wattrain</li> </ul> The deck is also fairly consistent thanks to Small World and Mystic Mine-protected Left Arm Offering.  The side deck is to switch strategies into a going first deck. The goal is to get out Zap Mustung, Mystic Mine, and Ojama Trio. Lock your opponent out of attacking, monster effects, and special summoning. Wattchimera is the win condition here."

Made before the Cyberdark","Made before the Cyberdark Structure Deck was released in Master Duel.  Some explanaitions for some card choices: <ul>  	<li>Gizmek Yata: Can be specialed over Core, gives you an additional normal summon and is a material for Nova. Searchable via Repair Plant.</li>  	<li>Power Bond: Makes OTKs easier and quicker. Stronger with the Cyberdark support.</li>  	<li>Maxx ""C"": Strongest card in the game, I hate it, why is it legal in Master Duel.</li>  	<li>Denko Sekka: I played against too many Floodgate/Eldlich Decks. Completely shuts them down and allows you to dou your combo undisturbed by backrow cards.</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave: Saves you from handtraps and Eldlich.</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplet: Insane boardbreaker/OTK-enabler, activates Herz</li>  	<li>Imperm: Great handtrap and useful even if going first.</li>  	<li>Cyber Eternity Dragon: Occasionaly useful. A great wall.</li>  	<li>Invoked Mechaba: A target for Nova.</li>  	<li>Artifact Durendal: A good Rank 5 XYZ. Mostly used if you go first.</li>  	<li>Constellar Pleiades: A great Rank 5 XYZ. Useful going first or second.</li>  	<li>AA-ZEUS: Insane Card, can be recycled with Repair Plant</li> </ul> Some general tactics:  <strong>Going first:</strong>  On a good day you make Infinity and pass. On a great day you have at least one hand trap in reserve. On an even greater day you can also make Pleiades/Durendal.  <strong>Going second:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Nova is good for extending by reviving one Cyber Dragon and can occasionally also go for game. It also deters Nibiru.</li>  	<li>Infinity protects your plays from enemy interruption and can clean the board a bit.</li>  	<li>Rampage Dragon is your main OTK enabler. It can attack up to 3 times via it's effect, it removes enemy backrow and it can be buffed by Sieger.</li>  	<li>Fortress/Megafleet are used to clean up the opponents board.</li>  	<li>Sieger is used to power up Rampage Dragon. You can also increase your Nova, run over a defense position monster with Sieger and then hit the opponent for 4200.</li> </ul> Here is a link to the first Decklist: https://ygoprodeck.com/cyber-dragons-19/"

Action Magic - Full Turn or Kaijus will help finish the job.</li>  	<li>Inferno Tempest - Banish all monsters from the decks + 20 additional cards thanks to Necroface and Nyannyan. Thunder Dragonhawk is included here to chain block this and potentially shuffle Necroface(s) that you drew.</li>  	<li>Mystic Mine - Wattchimera can seal the game vs an opponent that can't link away enough monsters.</li> </ul> The extra deck is really only used to link into monsters with &lt;300 attack. Baba Barber is especially useful to link away a Kaiju + Necroface.  The side deck is something I'm still experimenting with. The goal here is to go first and get Wattdragonfly, Universal Adapter, and Thunder Dragon's Hundred Thunders out. Survive. Then OTK with 3-4 Wattgiraffe/Wattcobras with boosted attack values."

On the play, the deck aims to set up a board with varied forms of interaction and sticky monsters to use to beat your opponent down on the crack back. On the draw, it can pivot with different forms of removal to push through boards and either swing over your opponents' monsters or easily access Zeus to wipe the board and combo in MP2. D/D/D is a high ceiling combo deck that can pivot between an aggressive playstyle and a control gameplan depending on what the situation calls for.Â  Overall a really fun deck that, with enough practice, any player can master and do well with. Any questions, comments or concerns you can msg me on discord @ drop_the_mike04#3517 :)."

This is the most efficient Malefic deck Ive played, able to generally end up with up to three negates and a buff 4000/4000 or two out on your field turn one. But it still needs some fine tuning.  &nbsp;  Tip:  Gizmek Naganaki can tribute itself to summon Paradox gear from the deck, Paradox gear can then tribute itself to summon paralell gear and add Malefic stardust dragon to your hand, then, use both those Malefics for Baronne De Fleur for a negate, or Dragocytos for another buff attacker. Or add Raradigm dragon/Malefic cyber end dragon to go into Geomathmech final sigma."

This deck is intended for the 2005 DS game, Nightmare Troubadour. It's mostly for me to plan out what cards I want before I get them, so be advised that this is largely untested. The hope is that RML has enough spell fodder to get plusses. Thunder dragon is there to thin out the deck, although it might be prudent to replace him with Foolish Burial to get the Exodia pieces out of the way (you can get them back to the hand using Dark Factory and Monster Reincarnation). On the other hand, he's a great target for Card Destruction, so maybe not? Toon Alligator is there so that you can use all three Contents instead of awkwardly having one left over but he might end up being a brick in the hand. The rest should be pretty self-explanatory."

I am playing them with the Symphonic Warrior engine, Genex Undine and a focus on revivability.  The Symphonic Warriors grant you an additional normal summon and a free level 5 machine type monster which you can use with Sulfefnir to go into Infinity. The ""Garnet"" itself ain't that much of a brick if you draw it, since tribute summoning him gets you the additional normal summon aswell. Try to get him into the grave instead of the extra deck afterwards if you can because you can revive him with the smaller Symphonic Warrior and get the effect again.  I also play Genex Undine since the mill from the deck is a cost and cannot be negated. Genex Controller can become a hard brick sometimes.  I am only playing 1 Halqi even though he is unlimited in TCG because I basically have 5 revives for him from which I can search 3. Because of Halqi I also play T.G. Wonder Magician who's an MST on summon and can also synchro summon on opponent's turn.  I have played Sulfefnir at 3 for the longest time and have just been experimenting with 2 for a few weeks. So far I do not think I have lost any consistency but instead have less dead cards in grave/hand.  Playing 6 handtraps can be bricky at times but you kind of have to play at least a few in the current state of the game.  The Ice-Bound God is a better Lost Wind in this deck.  Unchained Abomination just works perfectly.  Dragite or Dawn Dragster should always be on your field. Even better if you have an Infinity on their side.  &nbsp;  If you want to start playing this deck I cannot recommend enough to only us the non-tuners field effect if you really have to since it locks you into only Synchro machine type monsters.  &nbsp;  All in all I can really recommend this deck to anyone playing on locals-level. It is fairly consistent, has a great recovery and it's not a helmet deck, so you gotta use your brain."

We are also running Bazoo and Chaosrider to keep the bin clear and maintain board presence until you are ready to swing in for game with Gren Maju.

No disrespect if you like it (but taking it that way is very much welcome), but almost all players that play Drytron, Zoodiacs, Tri-Brigade, and Swordsoul that I've met are all sweaty tryhards who think they're so good at the game just by association of piloting the said decks. I just don't enjoy decks that does not make me want to think. It's one of those decks that I can play on a bad day and still win because it just plays itself, much like the other three. Play it if you want, I could not care any less. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can (I mean in this case, I'd rather not but I still do enjoy interacting with you guys so, yeah. Questions about anything that isn't related to this list is also very much welcome.).</span>"

The game plan for this deck is to get out the Buster Blader fusion and Buster Dragon out as fast as possible, in order to lock down the field, OR to use the Rokkets like normal and make whatever cards you want, like Borreload Savage, Chaos Ruler, Abyss, etc. </span>  <span><span>This also works for the TCG, just replace Maxx C for something else (like Veiler, Ogre, Droll, etc). If you're running this outside of Master Duel, I'd recommend swapping out Apollousa for Borrelend Dragon. You can also swap out Borrelsword for Borreload or whatever other Link-4 you want, I just like Borrelsword for OTK purposes because Buster Blader lockdown + Borrelsword is basically a garunteed OTK.</span></span>"

Lastly you can put whatever you want in the extra deck for the xyz monsters but the link monster is the most important one you absolutely should run everything else is bonus.

Obviously decks with strong boss monsters that are not in the extra deck are strong in this type of format.  Ultimate Conductor Tyranno with Double Evolution pill is perfect. Sending Overtex with branded fusion will allow you a quick double evolution pill. Or you can always send dark magician and then go into a Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.

Magistus, DPE","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with another Shaddolls list but this time, one that is modified to fit the upcoming Fusion Festival in Master Duel and are also updated to utilize the new splashable (NOT GENERIC) boss monster, <strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong>.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>Well first of all, it's an easy choice. It makes sense, it has a strong match up against combo decks in general because of its boss monsters, and it can be played either aggressively with going second cards or defensively with trap cards. It's a versatile deck that can very much function well without relying on hand traps for coverage, and can abuse one of the most powerful board breaking tools in Yu-Gi-Oh that is almost exclusively used by Fusion strategies, <strong><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>. Anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ The Dolls</strong> - <span>Their ratios might be a bit stranger than usual but I can somehow explain why. I had to cut space with <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Wendi</a> and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Squamata"">Squamata</a> to make room for 2 copies of <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>. This puts the deck in a position where it has just enough main starter materials as to not easily run out of them and still be able to go through the regular Shaddoll combo lines and still be able to fulfill the Rule of 5 (which is basically just having access to 5 Normal Summon starters in the deck), so what I've decided to play only 2 copies of both starter Shaddolls that of which I've already mentioned and only one of each utility Shaddoll monsters. And their main uses are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Shaddoll Beast</a></strong> - <span>For draw power.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon</a></strong> - <span>For Spell/Trap removal</span>.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Nehshaddoll Genius"">Nehshaddoll Genius</a></strong> - <span>For shutting down an opponent's monster for the duration of the turn. It having a different Attribute is also occasionally relevant.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a></strong> - <span>For recovery</span>.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Shaddoll Hedgehog</a></strong> - <span>For searching</span>.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a></strong> - <span>Only really relevant because of its different Attribute, being a LIGHT monster, as well as being a ""Shaddoll"" monster itself. Its Flip effect do come up from though very rarely, but it's better to have than not.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a></strong> - <span>For your grind game loops with Ariel and Hound.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>â¢ Magistus, the engine of choice</strong> - <span>The reasoning behind this is actually simpler, and that's also why I personally think this is one of if not the best version of Shaddolls that you can play in Master Duel's Fusion Festival, contending Invoked, and I'll be discussing more of it in-depth individually.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</strong></a> - <span>The superior Normal Summon for a generic Fusion engine, if you just want to play Pure Shaddolls. She practically does the same thing as <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>, except she's already a LIGHT monster, triggers off of being Special Summoned as well, and despite both of them being able to search for a Fusion Spell, their applications can be different depending on the situation. Aleister offers offensive pressure by being a ATK/DEF modifying hand trap, she offers recovery. Aleister offers more aggression to the table with additional Fusion Monsters in the form of the Invoked, she offers versatility for Link Climbing and Xyz/Synchro plays due to the nature of her archetype if you want to employ more of them. It really just comes down to your preference AND focus.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Magistus Vritra&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Magistus Vritra</strong></a> - <span>Commonly used to Link Climb into either a <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> for either Dragoon or DPE, or a Selene play for <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, but this time, having access to a LIGHT monster all the time in a format where you can't Link Climb is more than welcome and enough.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Magistus Invocation&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Magistus Invocation</strong></a> - <span>The archetypal Fusion Spell, similar to <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> due to them being both semi-generic Fusion spells but different in application, but at least it allows you to use materials from your hand when you Fusion Summon with it, which is the most frustrating part about the Invocation.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the deck, cry about it. No seriously, this Fusion Spell is one of the three most revolutionary Fusion Spells in the game, alongside Super Polymerization and Invocation (I'm choosing this one because it's archetypal and <a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a> is not, it's not that serious really.)</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Battle Phase shenanigans. It also allows you to play around targeting interruption/removal due to it being a Quick-Play Spell. It also allows you to do the first half of your usual Shaddolls combo while playing around <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>. Good enough as a searchable one of but more copies is welcome if felt needed.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a></strong> - <span>I'm playing 2 because I think it's the standard. You could probably get away with 1, but additional copies for safeguard is always good for anything if you can play with it well enough, especially in slower variants of the deck.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Shaddoll Core"">Shaddoll Core</a></strong> - <span>One of the most underrated card in the whole Shaddoll card pool. This card is one of the keys as to why this deck can GRIND. Its recovery effect when sent to the GY by a card effect is NOT ONCE PER TURN, meaning if you can somehow loop it, you can keep recurring resources back to your hand.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a></strong> - <span>This card is awfully disrespected by a lot of people due to it having the reputation of being ""only a Winda enabler"", but no. People seem to forget its more powerful effect of non-targeting, non-destruction removal that happens on resolution, provided that your opponent has a monster that shares an Attribute with the Shaddoll Fusion Monster you Fusion Summoned with this card. You do not have to summon only Winda with this. If your opponent has a problematic monster, feel free to summon a Shaddoll Fusion Monster with a matching Attribute instead. One copy is standard but I've seen some people play 2 and that's actually pretty reasonable. Do it if you have access to more, but one is enough.</span></span>  <span><strong>Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ The Fusion Dolls</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a></strong> - <span>Notorious for two things: 1. Enabling resource loop ever since it got introduced into the game, which results in a fantastic grind game. 2. Its non-targeting destruction effect that happens at the start of the Damage Step. There's a reason why it got Limited and even Banned for quite a long time. 2 is enough for some, but if you can play 3, there's no reason not to.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a></strong> - <span>The bane of every tryhard combo decks. One of the most famous floodgate monster in the game, with a very powerful effect of limiting both players to only 1 Special Summons for each per turn. It also has a destruction protection against card effects, that most people seem to forget when attempting to get rid of her. 2 is enough but you could always dare to play 3.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a></strong> - <span>The newest addition to the Shaddoll Fusion Monster line up, the key to both your grind game and also the source of your targeting interruption. Being indestructible by battle, she's also not a bad defensive monster. Also, people seem to forget that her negation effect is PERMANENT. Always do keep that in mind. Much like Winda, 2 of her is enough.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a></strong> - <span>Our only archetypal reactive negation effect in the deck, she used to be the go-to defensive Shaddoll monster, until Apkallone at least, due to her massive 3000 DEF body. We could play her since we have Extra Deck space, and also a good reason to play Mathematician.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</strong></a> - <span>The hard counter to Nekroz back in the day, and nowadays, Drytrons. She doesn't have anything proactive, instead she acts also much like Winda, except she's preventing both players from Special Summoning monsters from the hand or GY with Spell/Trap effects, that includes Ritual Summoning. She's also not bad at 2700 ATK. Just a one of, also the reason why we could play 2 Ariels.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>The others are pretty much all generic Super Polymerization targets that you feel like using. I prefer the usual line up of <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> for DARK heavy decks or mirror matches, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> is actually arguably best one for this format in particular, and <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> for the weird Attribute presence. <a data-name=""Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit"">Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit</a> is also technically a Super Polymerization target, and is a walking Fiendish Chain in itself. <a data-name=""Invoked Augoeides"">Invoked Augoeides</a>, in case we run into Invoked match ups, and the man of the hour himself, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">DPE</a>.</span>  <strong><span>Final Thoughts:</span></strong>  <span>Well, it's Shaddolls, and I absolutely fucking love them if it wasn't obvious enough. I can't wait to participate in the Normal Summon Aleister Festival, so much so that I might actually try and clear the rewards up to the title. I've already featured this deck and its variants in my former lists, multiple times, so I don't think I have much else to say about it as of now. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.

Summon the Omni-Negate, Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode. Figure out the best strategy to play the deck. Hardcore vibes, let's","<p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""5"">Welcome to the first set of my structure deck series. The series was inspired by my evaluation of certain archetypes I had played for quite some time in order to at least understand the basic mechanism in a specific period of time.This is, of course, not an official structure deck, I'm just unable to think of a better name.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""6"">Let's just head right into the deck. The first set, ""Structure Deck: Assault <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""77"" data-endindex=""85"" data-paragraphid=""6"">Emergency</span>"" is an Assault Mode-based deck. Some people probably say that Assault Mode is inherently bad, and I myself admit that it lacks what it takes to be a top deck, at least for now (although Konami seems to have abandoned this archetype, not giving any helpful support since 2019). The best buff they ever gave so far was probably making Emergency Teleport turn to Unlimited (3) status.</p>  <h3 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""7"">GENERAL STRATEGY</h3> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""8"">So, you see, there's actually no particular innate strategy available in the archetype itself, except by continuously relying on the combo of Psi-Reflector to Special Summon our Boss Monsters. The best we could do (without brainstorming with deckbuilding and further advancement and also wasting even more time) is to create our own strategy and spend most of the time relying on decisions and field analysis. It's pretty important for Assault Mode users, as the only factor I could find to make Assault Mode stand a chance is an experienced and wise duelist.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""9"">If you do not like to read card effects (at least for the cards you are not familiar with), you better start playing other archetypes instead of this one. It's going to be rough for you otherwise. Decision-making is very crucial. In this deck, you can say that the Extra Deck is our main arsenal, and the Main Deck is a tool to access it. I've been watching countless videos and brainstorming for quite a while (credit to DarkArmedDuelist's video), and I think I have found a decent arrangement for the deck. So let's just head to the explanation section about why I chose each of 'em.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""10"">Oh wait, one more thing. This is also important, yet a minor warning. First, this deck description section of mine might take a decent amount of time to read and even somewhat will possibly make you disappointed in the end (both because of the deck or my explanation, which may be proved to be a waste of time). Second, for dueling tips while using this deck of mine, please stop being a subjective duelist who wants to win climaxly if you do, because it's not going to work with this deck. You better finish your opponent as fast as possible and quietly, while you still have a chance. My gameplay so far has taught me that Assault Mode doesn't really stand a chance against most of the meta or top tier rogue decks in general, because of the fact that you can normally only summon 1 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""780"" data-endindex=""791"" data-paragraphid=""10"">Boss Monster</span> per turn via Psi-Reflector. But hey, my friend said that this deck of mine would make it to a mid-tier rogue deck. It's quite fun to play, too. Anyway, to the explanation section!</p>  <h3 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""11"">DECK MEMBERS</h3> <h5 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""12"">MAIN DECK</h5> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""13"">A. Monsters</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""14""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""30"" data-paragraphid=""14"">1) Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""15"">First off, our Boss Monster. If you've been playing the game for quite a while or intend on using the AM deck, I'm pretty sure you have at least heard of this card. <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""165"" data-endindex=""169"" data-paragraphid=""15"">Right</span>, SDAM is one of the better Assault Mode monsters. I mean, look. It's an Omni-Negate<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""254"" data-endindex=""258"" data-paragraphid=""15"">, you</span> can also get a free SD when this card is destroyed. <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""312"" data-endindex=""315"" data-paragraphid=""15"">SDAM</span> is probably the best AM monster (at least in pure Assault-Engine-based decks) due to its powerful effect and ease of summoning. You just need to bring up Stardust Dragon, which is already one of the easiest AM materials to summon and Assault Mode Activate it. This powered-up version of SD is indeed powerful, but not without any weaknesses. One, the main weakness will be the fact that the AM <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""711"" data-endindex=""716"" data-paragraphid=""15"">Engine</span> is fragile and can easily be destroyed by a single disruptive force. Two, this card is very vulnerable during its effect activation. Although you can use this card to negate, your opponent can also continue the chain and destroy this card easily. Three, cards like Called By The Grave are simply the natural enemy of SD and its AM counterpart. They not only prevented this card from returning after activating its effect, you also simply lost that free SD I mentioned. Five<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""1191"" data-endindex=""1196"" data-paragraphid=""15"">, this</span> card is <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""1206"" data-endindex=""1212"" data-paragraphid=""15"">USELESS</span> if you draw it from your deck. It's as if you literally skip 1 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""1277"" data-endindex=""1286"" data-paragraphid=""15"">Draw Phase</span> if you draw this card. The only way to fix this is to simply discard it for effect activation or use it via Assault Mode Zero.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""16"">Lastly, SDAM is very easy to bait. You need to use the effect very wisely. The card is a gun with only 1 bullet. Choose the cards to negate wisely.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""17"">2) Psi-Reflector</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Here comes our star. You definitely can't run an AM deck without this little <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""74"" data-endindex=""78"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Tuner</span> fellow. This card carries the whole Assault <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""122"" data-endindex=""127"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Engine</span> and the AM Engine itself revolves around this card. When this card is summoned, you can add 1 AM Activate or any monster that lists it in their card texts. Then, you can reveal AM Activate from your hand to trigger this card's ultimate effect. You can Special Summon 1 monster that has ""AM Activate"" in its card text<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""448"" data-endindex=""448"" data-paragraphid=""18"">,</span> and increase its level up to 4. With this effect, you can definitely access most of the level 6 to 9 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""547"" data-endindex=""562"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Synchro Monsters</span>. This card is also easily searchable via other deck members. Too bad, this card can only activate its effect once per turn, leading the deck to only be able to summon 1 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""735"" data-endindex=""746"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Boss Monster</span> consistently per turn if it was not negated (this is also very negatable). Make sure you use your resources efficiently to create a straight path (remove all possible threats on the field) for this card to shine.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""19""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""18"" data-paragraphid=""19"">3) Assault Sentinel</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""20"">The 2nd best assault monster after the Psi-Reflector. This card can be used to search for Psi-Reflectors and even prepare a target for its effect (since this card will go straight to the GY). Another effect of this card can change a monster's <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""243"" data-endindex=""251"" data-paragraphid=""20"">attribute</span> via an Extra Deck monster's attribute. This effect is a great addition to Psi-Reflector, allowing you to access even more Synchro Monsters with more <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""402"" data-endindex=""412"" data-paragraphid=""20"">restricting</span> material lists. The backlash<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""442"" data-endindex=""442"" data-paragraphid=""20"">,</span> is that you can't <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""462"" data-endindex=""475"" data-paragraphid=""20"">Special Summon</span> any monster this turn except Synchro Monsters (a few other cards also have a similar restriction). Not really a problem for this deck.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""21""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""15"" data-paragraphid=""21"">4) Assault Beast</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""22"">A searcher for AM Activate. You only need one in your deck. Since you can easily search for this card via Psi-Reflector, and even Assault Sentinel gives more beneficial effects than this card. Still pretty useful, though, in certain situations.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""23""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""40"" data-paragraphid=""23"">5) Ascator, Dawnwalker &amp; Fire Ant Ascator</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""24"">For time-sake, I will make things shorter. Maybe you should read the card effects to understand what I will say. Both cards are a pair. <span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""159"" data-endindex=""206"" data-paragraphid=""24"">Have a similar restriction as Assault Sentinel. </span>These pairs are the alternatives to the Psi-Reflector. With only the Psi Reflector, you can only summon 2 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""307"" data-endindex=""319"" data-paragraphid=""24"">Boss Monsters</span> at the very best. With this pair, you get the 3rd. I recommend either discarding useless SDAM or AM <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""417"" data-endindex=""420"" data-paragraphid=""24"">Zero</span>, or any less useful card for your situation.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""25""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""74"" data-paragraphid=""25"">6) PSY-Framegear Gamma (w/PSY-Frame Driver) &amp; Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""26"">Our main <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""9"" data-endindex=""16"" data-paragraphid=""26"">handtrap</span> force on the deck. The PSY-Frame Driver is recycleable, so you only need 1. Just make sure you won't make it banished unless you're forced to, since it's no longer recycleable in that situation. And yeah<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""215"" data-endindex=""216"" data-paragraphid=""26"">..</span> some classic Ash Blossom. I believe I don't need any further exposition. The PSY-Frame pair can even be an alternative to summoning another <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""355"" data-endindex=""366"" data-paragraphid=""26"">Boss Monster</span>, if you manage to activate it in your own turn, or chain it with the Synchron Formula available in your <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""468"" data-endindex=""476"" data-paragraphid=""26"">Side Deck</span> (<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""479"" data-endindex=""479"" data-paragraphid=""26"">A</span> pretty rare case).</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""27""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""59"" data-paragraphid=""27"">7) Nibiru, The Primal Being &amp; Gameciel, The Sea Turtle Kaiju</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""28"">Uh huh. Other classic cards<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""27"" data-endindex=""28"" data-paragraphid=""28"">. </span>These two cards are useful for getting rid of some monsters your opponent controls by tributing them. Use them wisely, and make sure you have something in your sleeve to destroy them later, since you definitely don't want your cards to be used against you. Pay special attention to Nibiru, since its stats are determined by the monsters it <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""356"" data-endindex=""363"" data-paragraphid=""28"">tributed</span>.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""29"">B.

You only need one in this deck, really. You can use this card to get rid of those annoying SDAMs in your hand, so that they can finally get some use. You can also get this card in your GY banished, so you can set AM Activate and immediately activate it this turn. This card is a perfect target for Ascator pairs or any cards that require discarding. The starthand combo is to discard this card by the Ascator effect and then Synchro Summon SD, and use this effect to immediately summon our SDAM on your very first turn.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""32""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""20"" data-paragraphid=""32"">2) Emergency Teleport</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""33"">A very useful <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""14"" data-endindex=""21"" data-paragraphid=""33"">searcher</span> card<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""27"" data-endindex=""28"" data-paragraphid=""33"">. </span>Use this card to search for either Psi-Reflector or Psy-Framegear (most of the time, the first one), and Bam.

You will send albion the branded dragon so that you will be able to set your branded in red at the end phase and have it live on your opponents turn. When you use branded fusion going first you're always going to want to send despian tragedy to search the ad libitum of despia because using him as material from your hand when making the chimera allows you to Immediately special summon the mirrorjade back to your side of the field with its banish effect live again.  The frighfur package helps you get materials in your hand for guardian chimera as well as possibly being bait for an ash blossom.  The light hex sealed fusion allows access to dragoon and can also be used as a third copy of Fallen of albaz in a pinch.  The hand traps that hurt the deck the most are played as crossout designator targets at 2x.  The side deck mostly consists of blowout cards for going second with the inclusion of a small zombie world package. You can send Necroworld banshee off of branded fusion to access your zombie world and you can then use super polymerization to make dragonecro nethersoul dragon using your opponents monsters as material.

The goal is to be a midrange deck that consistently puts Chengying on the table with multiple ways to trigger him, and hopefully tools to protect him. I'm still on DPE, but I also don't think you can pass up the consistency granted by Halq - Auroradon. That combo is also super flexible here, ending on either Yazi to set up Swordsoul plays with Auroradon and Yazi, or Denglong + Draco Berserker, in addition to the option of just making Verte when you need it. I think DPE is too important to cut in a Chengying based version, since it can trigger Chengying in a pinch and works neatly with Torrential Tribute as well, but I also think in a lot of situations you're either hoping to draw Fusion Destiny and make Halq plays, or else you're negated into infinity and make DPE in desperation - these are both still good plays I think the deck needs access to. It also offers a line that plays under Nib, although I'm not hyper impressed by that or scared by Nib. Still nice.  This version of the deck is a midrange trap(ish) version focusing on the grind game, and on making Wyrm monsters. There simply wasn't enough space for the actual essentials and all of the tech choices I wanted to run, so instead it is greedy as all hell, and hoping to go first. Having said that, Solemns are still good going second, and Swordsoul can sure break boards, you bet your bippy.  This deck is good, not terrifying, but very strong, and forms of it (Wrym piles basically) are probably going to be good for quite a while. It is also the kind of deck that will likely continue to randomly top events even when it is not good, and will also likely have more than one heyday, if I had to guess, just on the basis of Wyrm synchro piles having such good support already. Denglong is probably not essential, but I like the idea of running it as an alternative in the Auroradon combo. But you could do as well or better with Herald of the Arc Light, which also has a floodgate effect - still, this is a counter trap, so that's pretty good. Or you could just not have that line of play and instead focus on diversity and tech calls - there is space. But for the way I like to play Swordsoul, I need a 16 card extra deck, and whatever I cut will hurt. So we're pretty pure, at least in terms of how we end babeee.  Still doing some tuning. Denglong setups exist, but don't come up, and O-Lion is less of a brick than Nine Pillars, so Denglong is out, and Herald is in. I think it is time to unban this card in the TCG if it exists and Wyrm Synchro doesn't want to play it. You could run 3 Ecclesia and 1 Mo-ye for the same number of ""starters"", and you'd see Ecclesia more often going second, but it seems brickier, not as good at grinding, and especially bricky going first. I like these ratios a lot. You could run 2 Tour Guide for more 1 card starts, but I'm okay with most of my openings requiring 2 cards to start, and 1 Tour Guide seems totally fine, especially since the Rota is also a less restrictive 1 card start."

The ideal play would be to get out of Salamangreat Sanctuary as quickly as possible by link summoning Balelynx as quickly as possible to get started on the link plays. Then work on getting out Pyro Phoenix to be able to board wipe your opponent once or twice, then equipping Salamangreat Claw them gives them some protection. The main portions of the deck are designed around reusing a lot of the same materials as you link summon up to Pyro Phoenix. The cards in the side deck are designed to be swapped with the third copy of monsters that exist in the main deck only, otherwise, the consistency tends to break down."

I'm just playing 48 cards so it doesn't count!</span>  <span>Okay so maybe it counts a little but I think there's a big difference in the deck that played all the best engines together to abuse only the strongest of cards and, yknow, Lightsworns. I appreciate a good chaos pile deck as much as the next guy!</span>  <span>So with Dimension Force on it's way we need to talk about the newest addition to the P.U.N.K. team: <span><a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note"">Noh-P.U.N.K. Dia Note</a></span>.</span>  <span>Dia Note does something very important: Not being a level 8 monster. It can be searched and added by <span><a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K.

This means that one <span><a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin"">Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin</a></span> can mill 9 cards. People used to play engines just to summon <span><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> </span>and now we have an engine (a consistent one at that!) that summons Chaos Ruler <em>and</em> <span><a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a></span>. With <span><a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow"">Fairy Tail - Snow</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a></span> (anyone else keep calling it fissure?) no longer being forbidden I'd be a shame NOT to play a chaos pile deck!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Put on your overalls and grab a wrench, we're talking engines now!</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong>P.U.N.K.</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span>Combo Line:</span> <ol>  	<li><span>Summon Ze Amin, effect to add Foxy Tune.</span></li>  	<li><span>Foxy Tune effect to SS Dia Note.</span></li>  	<li><span>Synchro Summon Chaos Ruler, C1 Chaos Ruler C2 Dia Note to SS Foxy Tune // Mill 5</span></li>  	<li><span>Overlay both for Zombie Vampire // Mill 4</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Keep in mind that chaos pile decks are non-linear so you might do other stuff in between this.</span></li>  	<li><span>P.U.N.K.s are also the reason I'm not playing 60 cards.

NOT once per turn. If you have a stacked GY you can use her as a body on your turn, too.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>Destrudo:</strong> Body and tuner. Can summon <span><a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">F.A. Dawn Dragster</a></span> with ease.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>Called By The Grave:</strong> <span><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></span> is good going first and even going second against Branded.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>Handtraps:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></span>: Generally one of the stronger handtraps. Does wonders against Branded.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">DD Crow</a></span>: Like Ghost Belle it manipulates the GY. Since it's a DARK it's better here than Belle.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></span>: Albeit technically a worse Imperm when it comes to it's function as a handtrap, it is also a tuner and a LIGHT making it better here than Imperm.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>The all-generic Extra Deck</span>  <span>Think of a number between 1 and 1652. Picked one? Great. I guarantee you whatever number you picked, it would still not be enough to fit all Extra Deck cards that Pile decks would like to play. (A higher number and I'd have to account for custom cards. No thank you) So these are the 15 I decided to play and here's why. Welcome to my TED Talk:</span> <ul>  	<li><span><strong>Link Monsters:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a></span>: Used to link climb with the Chaos Dragons.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span>: Used to summon Knightmare Phoenix on your opponent's turn and puts Snow back into the GY.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></span>: Used to link climb or to summon Sharakusai to Synchro Summon on your opponent's turn. It's other effect can be used for Desert Locust (I'll refer to the card later).</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></span>: Spins a card from your opponent.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></span>: Multiple monster effect negates. It never hurts to use your first badge of resources for her. If you can, use Chaos Ruler before going into Zombie Vampire and summon it back with its effect, then it won't get banished if you overlay it for Zombie Vampire later.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></span>: Used to secure game.</span></li>  	<li><span><em>Closing Thoughts:</em> Each of them is very important. I really cut it down to the necessities. If I could I'd play more. <span><a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a></span> for example is great, especially after Vampire Zombie milled cards for your opponent.</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>XYZ Monsters:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a></span>: Used to flex your price card to let everyone know your either crazy good or crazy rich. Oh it also mills 3 and might draw you some cards, too.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""The Zombie Vampire"">The Zombie Vampire</a></span>: Mills 4 cards and summons you another body. Depending on your opponent's deck this can either really mess them up or help them greatly. But we're all Dopamine addicts so don't even pretend you'd hesitate for even a second to use it's effect even against the worst matchup possible.</span></li>  	<li><span><em>Closing Thoughts</em>: Again I kept it at minimum to overcompensate with Synchro Monsters. Definitely play both. <span><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a></span> are fantastic additions to your lineup.Â </span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>Synchro Monsters:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Desert Locust"">Desert Locust</a></span>: Loops a card out of your opponent's hand and can then summon Fleur with Snow or Amazing Dragon with Dawn Dragster after it's used its effect.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""F.A. Dawn Dragster"">FA Dawn Dragster</a></span>: It's a Spell/Trap negate that can be made with Destrudo and almost any monster.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a></span>: Can mill Snow and then also used for another Synchro Summon, etc.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a></span>: Used to mill cards and adds a card to hand.</span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></span>: You have plenty of tuners, non-tuners, level 4 monsters and links in the GY so this is an easy omni negate. <span>// <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a></span> is a great budget option as long as you get Halq into the GY (and then not banish it with Snow..obviously).</span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a></span>: There're surprisingly many ways to make a level 10 Synchro and this one is simply the strongest one. <span>// For a budget option I'd choose <span><a data-name=""Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying"">Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying</a></span>. It has near infinite attack after using Snow once or twice, protection and has great removal. There's plenty of removal already that's why I'd prefer Fleur.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon"">Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon</a></span>: It can bounce 1-2 cards or extend when going for lethal.</span></li>  	<li><span><em>Closing Thoughts:</em> As you can see I'm playing a whole lot of Synchro monsters for a whole lot of different board states. Chaos pile decks are very non-linear but you could technically remove Desert Locust, Fleur and Amazing Dragon for more Link or XYZ monsters. I recommend keeping the other ones!</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Once again I have to mess with the Side Deck to get the right tags. Can we please bring choosing tags back? :')</span>"

Inspired by Power Rangers!","  Despite the name, this is not a Dino Thunder Dragons deck. This is a Dinomorphia deck featuring two of their newest cards from Dimension Force: Dinomorphia Rexturm and Dinomorphia Frenzy! The name was inspired by Dinomorphia Frenzy's artwork, which is inspired by a scene from Power Rangers: Dino Thunder. The card was trending on Twitter at the end of 2021 because of the comparison.  &nbsp;  Twitter link: https://twitter.com/YuGiOhNewsTCG/status/1476587455637819395  &nbsp;  This deck sticks to the archetype's ""go first or burst"" strategy, but with two good tech choices for Dinomorphia. It contains two copies of Hope For Escape for some draw power, and Ferret Flames for monster removal. In fact, if your LP is low enough, Ferret Flames can be a board wipe for your opponent. The best part is that it doesn't shuffle their monsters into the deck--it forces your opponent to do that to their monsters, so this can get rid of unaffected beaters like Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon, Ancient Gear Chaos Giant, and even UCT under Misc.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Interestingly, the old version still managed to beat some decks at a local tournament in May 2019 probably thanks to the surprise effect of a deck composition that hadn't been used for a very long time and for which the meta wasn't prepared. This year I tried to use it again, but it was a complete disaster, the game has now a completely new rhythm and the old deck couldn't keep up without hand traps and newer and more powerful versions of some cards. The core idea is still to play in an unexpected manner w.r.t. the current meta and surprise the opponents who could not have a proper side deck to counter our strategy. <h3>Strategy:</h3> Ideally, you want on the field the <a data-name=""InspectorÂ  Boarder"">InspectorÂ  Boarder</a>, the <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a> and/or <a data-name=""Thunder King Rai-Oh"">Thunder King Rai-Oh</a>. They need to be defended, but it's also important to use your hand traps to stop your opponents immediately before they manage to bring big monsters on the field.  A lot of drawing cards are present to allow for a constant hand refill. I am seriously considering adding one or more <a data-name=""Maxx C"">Maxx C</a> in case the deck runs out of cards too quickly (of course only if it gets unbanned).  Some <em>testing is needed</em> to understand whether the deck is balanced or it needs more defending or drawing cards.  The <strong>Extra Deck</strong> is not essential for the moment, therefore can be improved for strategic use in case of emergencies and the only useful card is the <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a>. It is important to have a full 15 cards in order to exploit the <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance.</a>  The <strong>Side Deck</strong> has counters that could be needed against specific decks. It allows focusing on removing, destroying small monsters, countering decks with a lot of summoning, countering decks using the graveyard and more. <h3>Possible edits:</h3> <ul>  	<li><strong>Among the following cards:</strong> - 1x <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> - 3x <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> Increase PoD if you need more drawings, or remove if you need more defensive traps. Consider substituting with <a data-name=""Maxx C"">Maxx C</a>. If 3x <a data-name=""Reigeki"">Reigeki </a>are too many they can be reduced to make room for other cards (such as <a data-name=""Maxx C"">Maxx C</a>)</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><strong>Among the following cards:</strong> - 1x <a data-name=""Magic Cylinder"">Magic Cylinder</a> - 2x <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a> - 2x <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched </a>- 2x <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a> Can be rearranged into a new composition of other defensive/offensive traps (look at the list at the end of the deck description). <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> or <a data-name=""Witch's Strike"">Witch's Strike</a> could be a valid substitute for the <a data-name=""Magic Cylinder"">Magic Cylinder</a> (which is just present for fun and hit opponents who do not expect it). <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> could be reduced to 1 and all the other cards on this list can be completely removed (not all at the same time, still need some defences) in case of better alternatives.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The Ritual monster in the Main Deck can be substituted with a Maxx C or with any of the 3 single monsters in x1 present in the Side Deck</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>In the Side Deck it is possible to substitute the 3x <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a> with 1/2x more <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and one or two traps as <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> and/or <a data-name=""Witch's Strike"">Witch's Strike</a> or better alternatives.</li> </ul> <strong>Other possibly useful cards</strong>: - <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> to be increased if necessary - <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> to be increased if necessary - <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> - <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> - <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> - <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More </a>- <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> - <a data-name=""Witch's Strike"">Witch's Strike</a> - <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> - <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> - <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a> - <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> - <a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a> - <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> - <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> - <a data-name=""Black Horn of Heaven"">Black Horn of Heaven</a> - <a data-name=""Maxx C"">Maxx C </a>- <a data-name=""Mistake"">Mistake</a> - <a data-name=""Vanity's Emptiness"">Vanity's Emptiness</a> - <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a> - <a data-name=""Time Seal"">Time Seal</a> - <a data-name=""Guiding Ariadne"">Guiding Ariadne</a> (take inspiration from <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/antimeta-stun/"">this</a>) - Any version of the barrier statue - Other versions of <a data-name=""Solmen Judgement"">Solmen Judgement</a> - Other versions of <a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> (especially <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a>) - Any card contrasting the current meta - Any improvement to the Extra Deck bringing in some usable cards  <em>Please leave a comment and let me know what you think!</em>"

Enjoy!,"Despite the domination of the Splight archetype, Tearalaments made their own steps in the OCG and had a bit of success.  The deck's standard play revolves around normal summoningÂ <strong>Tearalaments Reinoheart</strong>, the by using her effectÂ <strong>Tearalaments Shaylen, Tearalaments Haufenis or Tearalaments Meiru</strong> is sent to the GY for their fusion summoning effect to activate. The usual target isÂ <strong>Tearalaments Kitkalos </strong>who searches the trap card <strong>Tearalaments Metanoise</strong>.  Branded fusion also synergises with the archetype since it allows the player to send a Tearalaments monster to the GY and thus trigger it's effect to go for the play mentioned above.  As most meta decks, Tearalaments can also afford to run a respectable amount of handtraps.

What I like most about this deck is that you feel that Fluffal has a high ceiling of moves, even more considering that the deck doesn't use any LINK-2 Enabler to make moves, but you <strong>rotate the engine around your cards</strong>. And for that it is subdivided into three Archetypes: <strong>""Fluffal"" Cards, ""Edge Imp"" Cards and ""Frightfur"" Cards</strong> and since practically all fusions are semi-generic and need at least 1 ""Fluffal"" and 1 ""Edge Imp ""Monster to be Made this is a typical big engine to play. The only LINK Monster missing when playing Fluffal in Fusion Format is <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> for bringing back from the GY a <strong>name necessary to make a certain Fusion Summon</strong> for example. Despite having received excellent support over the years, Fluffal's focus in Fusion Format is to <strong>go Second Always</strong> because turn 1 you don't have many ways to <strong>interact with the opponent</strong> being at most passing with <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> + <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> that makes the move of Summon <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> on your opponent's turn allowing you to <strong>destroy 1 card on each side of the field</strong> and <strong>draw 2 cards and discard 1</strong> with Fluffal Penguin.  This is not a linear deck, each <strong>Starter Hand will change the way you run the engine</strong> and make field presence and advantage. It's like playing a puzzle, and that's why this is a deck that, even with simple effects cards, is quite complex to play correctly. The deck has a lot of <strong>Search Power, Draw Power and Recycling</strong> needed to play since it's a Fusion deck that <strong>doesn't ""CHEAT"" in the mechanics</strong> because you still Fusion Summon through <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>, at most you have <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> that allows you <strong>banish Fusion Materials from the GY</strong> to make Fusions from the Extra Deck as a Fusion Summon Enabler, otherwise everything you do is in the race and so you need to know <strong>how to manage resources as efficiently as possible</strong> because you will most of the time need it <strong>Draw half of your deck in one turn</strong> to be able to Fusion Summon. Because you need to Fusion Summon with <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> and in general ""Frightfur"" Fusion Monsters are semi-generic because it requires an ""Edge Imp"" Monster and a ""Fluffal"" Monster as material you will come across several Main Deck cards that generate advantage like the <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a> and <a data-name=""Engage!"">Engage!</a> level such as: <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>, <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> and especially <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> which is a Continuous Spell with two <strong>Soft Once Per Turn effects</strong> (once per copy) being an absurd card in terms of advantage for Fluffal's Archetype. As this is a very old Archetype several of the cards especially the Extra Deck monsters have Soft Once Per Turn effects so whenever you <strong>bring a different copy of them to the field you will be able to use their effects again</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Details during Fluffal's Fusion Format Gameplay</strong>:  As I don't have the <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> summon I have to use <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> as an <strong>extender as soon as possible</strong> and it hurts to have several push moves but that's ok for this version only Fusion Summon. The trick behind <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> is that you can <strong>use your first effect</strong> of returning a ""Frightfur"" Fusion to the Extra Deck and <strong>giving Monster Reborn</strong> because in the Normal version of Fluffal you always want to send it straight to the GY with the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> but in Fusion Format you need to take advantage of the card's first effect as well. For that you need to make <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> using <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> as material and activate its effect to Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> from Deck to hand and use <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> send <a data-name=""Frightfur Daredevil"">Frightfur Daredevil</a> to GY and gain ATK Boost to be able to use <strong>Repair first eff</strong> and return Daredevil to the Extra Deck and reborn from <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> for example to use its Special from Hand effect again. That way you not only extend your rolls but you will also have the second effect of Frightfur Repair available on the next turn.  When you have several cards in your hand that don't help you at all, it's very good to <strong>start discarding them to see new cards</strong> with <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>.  Even if <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> doesn't have good targets against the opponent's deck you can simply use Super Polymerization <strong>on your Monsters during the Battle Phase</strong> to guarantee OTK when using for example <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> as material to make the <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> that enters giving Reborn from Kraken. Another use of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is taking the target out of an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> for example so that your Fusion monster like <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> resolves and destroys your opponent's cards.  Interesting to see how to <strong>make your chain link</strong> with the deck because several Main Deck monsters trigger effs when <strong>sent to the GY as Fusion Materials</strong> so if you are facing a deck of <strong>Omninegate monsters</strong> like <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> you can <strong>""Chain Block""</strong> the most important effects for them to resolve.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> is very easy to make with any ""Frightfur"" Fusion and the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> added with <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Simple Deck Combo Lines:</strong> They are more about <strong>small combinations of cards that make a certain advantage</strong> to allow you to connect the pieces necessary to make Fusion Summon. The combo <strong>changes a lot as the Draws happen</strong> so it's more about understanding the gameplay than memorizing moves.  //////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combo 1: (Bear +

////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Comments about the presented Combos:</strong>  A very good move for you to make is to use <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> eff or <a data-name=""Frightfur Cruel Whale"">Frightfur Cruel Whale</a> eff to <strong>destroy your own</strong> <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to gain its Search effect and if you haven't even Normal Summoned you can add the <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> that will set the Toy Vendor back field and send <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> to the GY.  A card that works similar to what I said above is <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, which also can <strong>trigger eff from Search from Toy Vendor</strong> without having to spend your Normal Summon since you <strong>discard it from your hand</strong> with <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to draw 1 card and then it comes back from the GY to the field when <strong>sending the Toy Vendor to the GY</strong> for Search eff trigger. Going Second is out of <strong>Floodgates</strong> and in Grind Game instead of <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> add directly the monster you want you can add <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> and set another <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to use <a data-name=""Golden Lord"">Golden Lord</a> eff and with Toy Vendor add the Target you wanted with Dog having the Golden Lord on the field. But I think he <strong>will be banned from the Fusion Event Banlist</strong> so I'm not even using it in the Main Deck.  <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> is one of the last supports this deck has received over the years and is a perfect card for Fluffal's deck strategy: <strong>Spot Removal</strong> on both turns with <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a>, <strong>Combo Enabler</strong> sending <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> to GY and <strong>OTK Tool that will boost the ATK</strong> of your Fusion monsters.  <strong>Some OTK options:</strong> Making <a data-name=""Frightfur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightfur Sabre-Tooth</a> using <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> as material and giving Reborn from Kraken to the field <strong>grants you an OTK of 8400damage</strong> as Kraken can <strong>attack twice</strong> and each ""Frightfur"" fusion <strong>gains 400ATK from Sabre-Tooth</strong>.  Another way to OTK is to make <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> + <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> which will <strong>boost 300ATK for each ""Fluffal"" and ""Frightfur""</strong> monster so you get a 600ATK boost for both and do an OTK of 8100damage. <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> using his <strong>ATK Boost effect</strong> on <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> makes him reach 3300ATK and already grants another OTK. So you can see that <a data-name=""Frightfur Kragen"">Frightfur Kraken</a> is a very strong enabler to finish the game and has synergy with the main Archetype fusions for that.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Technoplay:</strong>  ////////////////<strong>Main Deck Cards:</strong>  When you manage to Reborn GY's <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> you see how versatile he is and can use his effect to <strong>Special Summon from Hand</strong> again since it's Soft Once Per Turn(SOFT).  <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> allows you to make a really cool move of adding <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> and returning Fluffal Dog to hand to Reborn <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> for example allowing you to <strong>make another Fusion Summon</strong> when having access to the material that was missing. Same goes for <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> set <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and Send <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> play for GY because you can add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> with Toy Vendor. And when returning Fluffal Dog or Fluffal Dolphin you <strong>guarantee a Follow Up for the next turn</strong> to be your Normal Summon which <strong>makes Fluffal Sheep even better</strong>.  The <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> eff to set the <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> in the field if you have already used <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> eff in GY you can just send <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> to the GY and there is a <strong>very cool Trick</strong> to use the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> effect and <strong>return a ""Fluffal "" Monster to the top of the Deck</strong> and with the <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> set by the Dolphin you <strong>Draw and Special Summon</strong> this ""Fluffal"" to be another Extender.  <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> can <strong>recycle</strong> <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> <strong>back into the deck</strong> in Grind Game so even if you use a copy there are ways you <strong>can reuse it throughout the game</strong>. It is also a <strong>good effect to Chain Block</strong> the Fusion you bring to the field and for you to be able to resolve <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> in the Grind Game because it is necessary to have <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> in the deck to activate.  <a data-name=""Fluffal Own"">Fluffal Own</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Fluffal Cat</a> are cards that will allow you to continue to <strong>do more Fusion Summon when accessing Polymerization</strong> during your turn to take control of the game. Your Opponent can use <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a> on the <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> effect because it banishes a Fluffal from the GY as an effect resolution and not as a cost.  <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> is one of the main pieces for you to <strong>maintain card advantage</strong> while Fusion Summoning and is a great discard also giving search <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> or <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a>.  <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> is a kind of Hand Trap in the opponent's turn by Fusion Summoning <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> to destroy a card it controls and if you only control Cruel Whale you <strong>can protect it from destruction with Scythe's own effect in the GY</strong> then you take a card from the opponent while guaranteeing a body on the Cruel Whale table that can even use the second effect of sending <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> to the GY and you have one more Extender on your turn. The best Fluffal Monster option to use in conjunction with Edge Imp Scythe for Fusion Summon is <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> which gives you 2 Draws and 1 Discard.  <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> is Soft Once Per Turn both effects and you <strong>don't need to Special the Fluffal Monster</strong>, you can simply add it to the hand and <strong>Special Summon any other Monster</strong> in your hand. If you need <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> in the GY and you have already made <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> plays you can simply use <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> send Repair for Extender plays.  <a data-name=""Royal Penguins Garden"">Royal Penguins Garden</a> is a Continuous Spell that allows you to do excellent Combos in the deck but at this point it <strong>doesn't exist in Master Duel</strong>.  ////////////////<strong>Extra Deck Cards:</strong>  If you activate <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> while controlling <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> you can chain its effect just to <strong>send a Fusion from the Extra Deck to the GY</strong> and be able to use it with Frightfur Fusion to make <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> without having to banish any Fusions in field guaranteeing OTK.  If you pass to the opponent with <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> and Fluffal Monster in Hand and <a data-name=""Frightfur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightfur Sabre-Tooth</a> in Field: Activate Edge Imp Scythe eff Fusion <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> (using Sabre-Tooth and Scythe and Fluffal Monster) = Sabre-Tooth(<strong>with Protection from Destruction by Battle or Card Effects</strong>) This is a way to field a monster that is very <strong>difficult for most decks to take out of the field</strong>, ensuring it survives your opponent's turn and buys you time to rejoin the game. And you can still take advantage of this protection when using the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> effect by choosing the Saber-Tooth on your side of the field to be destroyed but as it has the protection only the opponent's card will be destroyed.  Virtually all Archetype Frightfur fusions are <strong>Soft Once Per Turn (SOFT)</strong>, that is, every time you <strong>Summon a different copy of the same card</strong>, you can <strong>use its effects again</strong> either by <strong>sending your opponent's monsters</strong> to the GY with <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>, or continue to <strong>ATK Boost</strong> your fusions with <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a>. And this has great synergy with <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> because whenever you give Reborn from the Fusion you used to make it, that fusion can use its effects again on the field. The <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> effect to send a monster to gy <strong>doesn't allow you to attack directly with it</strong> for the rest of the turn but if <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> gives Reborn the Kraken again it will be able to give two direct atk as it is considered a different card.  <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> has the role of just bringing the <a data-name=""Frightfur Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a> to the field with the advantage of being <strong>treated as a Fusion Summoned Card</strong> so if you use it to make the <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> you can Reborn it back to the field and be able to attack with it and still have the <strong>Floating effect</strong> if it is destroyed by an opponent's card. Also it allows you to make <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> using Frightfur Patchwork Add <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> and <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> and also Edge Imp Chain trigger eff to add Frightfur Fusion to the hand for example. Another detail about the <a data-name=""Frightfur Sheep"">Frightfur Sheep</a> is that you attack a monster stronger than it on purpose just to <strong>bring it back and attack with Boost 800ATK</strong> being able to take several strong bugs from the opponent.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// Issues of the version focused on <strong>Fusion Monsters Only</strong>: You need to <strong>do the first Fusion Summon for the deck to be able to continue playing</strong> and as there is no <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> you have difficulties in triggering eff of <a data-name=""Edge imp Chain"">Edge imp Chain</a> to add Patchwork that is needed to do the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> which can be Double Extender in addition to interaction because you can destroy Toy Vendor and send <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> to GY.  <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, these are just examples of Staples that can be used in the Main Deck.  &nbsp;"

It can survive against meta-decks that can negate your ass multiple times and with the right luck, you can still have some resources to still have a strategy to win.  The main first move strategy is to have 2 Spyral cards on the field to summon <strong>Double Helix</strong>. Use <strong>Spyral DroneÂ </strong>to find out the top card on your opponent's deck is so you can correctly activate other Spyral cards' effects. After summoningÂ <strong>Spyral Drone,</strong> you should hope that you have <strong>Super Agent</strong> in your hand to special summon on the field or cards that can bring him to your hand like <strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> or <strong>Spiral Resort</strong>. There is other tricks to manage to have other Spyral cards special summoned on your first turn:  <em><strong>-</strong></em><em>One for One can have you have 2 Drones on the field (if something happens that would have O.F.O. negated, the monster would still be discarded. Managing to discard a Spyral Rescue can special summon the monster from the grave yard.  -Magicians' souls can send a Spyral Master Plan to the graveyard and send Spyral Rescue in your hand (and one other spyral trap) to the grave yard so you could use Spyral Rescue in the graveyard to special summon Master Plan. (This is probably the best way since it could burn out your opponent's hand traps Like Effect Veiler or Ash BlossomÂ and the result of sending cards in the grave yard would still happen, though obviouslyÂ you wont draw cards from Magician's Souls' effect.)  -Managing to discard a Spyral monster and having Big Red in your hand can special summon that Spyral Monster. Most people would like to keep Big Red for an emergency, but its good material to special summon Spyral Sleeper. With the right cards and with this strategy, you can have a good collection of cards in your hand so having Sleeper and with multiple Spyral cards already in the graveyard, you could also have Spyral Sleeper on the field on your first turn.  -Before summoning Drone, summon Quick Fix instead. Activate his effect by adding Big Red to your hand then sacrifice him to summon Linkuriboh. Using his effect in the graveyard can have Quick Fix special summon himself by discarding a card in your hand (you need to discard a spyral monster). After gaining another card from Quick Fix, use Big Red to special summon that discard Spyral Monster from the graveyard. (Warning: Quick Fix would be sent to the Banishment during Link Summoning)  </em>Those are just few ways to get a head start on the first or second turn. By the end of your turn, you'd want <strong>Spyral Double Helix</strong> and <strong>Spyral Resort</strong> on the field. In a situation where you have no cards left and just managed to summon <strong>Spyral Double Helix</strong>, have his effect special summon <strong>Spyral Master Plan</strong>. After gaining a card from <strong>Master Plan</strong>, preferably <strong>Spyral Rescue</strong>, Link Summon another <strong>Double Helix</strong> to activate <strong>Master Plan</strong>'s effect in the grave yard to draw a <strong>Spyral Resort</strong> and any Spyral Monster to your hand.Â <em> Depending on hand you started out with, you should have the right card to prepare for your opponent's next turn: -If you haven't used Super Agent's effect to be special summoned, draw him and summon him. -If you only have Double Helix on the field, draw Spyral Gear: Last Resort to keep Double Helix from dying. -If you have a good amount of cards on your spell and trap zone, draw Spyral Sleeper -If you already have a Spyral Resort and you summoned Master Plan, you don't have to make the extra link summon unless to have an extra Resort and a extra Spyral Monster. -If you managed to special summon Master Plan without Double Helix's effect, special summon Quick Fix to add Utility Wire and/or Fully Armed. (You could have both by link summoning Quick fix for Linkuriboh , then using Quick Fix's effect to bring him back from the graveyard. However he will be banished next time he is destroyed. </em>There are other back up strategies in case your opponent negates you hard enough to almost run out of options with your Spyral Cards. -<em>The Numeron Network and the Numeron XYZ monsters is good for a last ditch comeback.  -Underworld Goddess and Mekk-Knight is used as move to destroy your opponent's nearly invincible monster depending on the situation. Even if the Numeron XYZ monsters can't be used to attack, they can still be used as material.  -Security Dragon can be used to send your opponent's nearly invincible monster back to their hand. By the off chance that you were unable to summon Double Helix but still have 2 effect monsters on the field, Code Breaker Virus Swordsman can be used to link together with Security Dragon.  -Slifer is good to have during matches that are drawn out. Spyral Resort, Master Plan, Spyral Mission: Assault, and Double Helix regularly draw cards to your hand to generate Slifer's attack points (once I managed to have it up to 12,000atk) and the ways to have monsters on your field can be used as materialsÂ to tribute summon Slifer to the field.  -Big Eye would be used on a rare occasion if you'd managed to have both Master Plans on the field.  </em>Thats everything I can think of for strategy off the top of my head and the more you practice with your deck, the more flexible your own strategy can be. Its my first time adding a deck to this website and its already waaaaaaaaaay too long to read, but this deck has brought me to Platinum Rank 1.

Final board: Schisme, some monster(depend of situation), and if i have on my hand, some trap.  My stratÃ©gie for going first:  Take from the side deck: Scythe engine, whitch's strike.  Take off gamma and put in veiler/ghost/belle x3  Do you think it will be a strong enought deck to score at locals? Maybe win ?:D  Any advice will be really apreciate!!!  Cheers guys"

Rated Toadally Awesome by many.,"Fast shark XYZ that will crumble under the weight of a single handtrap. Main deck lacks handtraps because they are expensive. I've been playing a version of this deck with handtraps in Master Duel and it works well enough.  Starters: Beautunaful Princess, Buzzsaw Shark, Lantern Shark  Boss monsters: Utopic Draco Future, Silent Honor ARK, Silent Honor DARK, Stealth Kragen  Usually I summon Bahamut Shark and detach to summon Toadally Awesome for that toadally sick negate. If I'm lucky enough I can get out another Rank 4, then I use the two Rank 4s to summon Utopic Future -&gt; Utopic Draco Future. If you're holding XYZ Remora in your starting hand don't detach, special summon Remora and then you'll get back the two detached monsters.  Set Whitefish Salvage as soon as you get it. You win if it's destroyed (add fish from deck to hand) and you win if it stays on the field (add fish from GY to hand every turn). Remember to special summon Silent Sea Nettle from your hand BEFORE special summoning Silent Angler. If you hold XYZ Revive Splash, probably set it.  After getting Utopic Draco Future out, I usually get out No. 4 Stealth Kragen if I'm in good shape, or No. 101 Silent Honor ARK if I'm in bad shape.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <em>Sphere Kuriboh is the only handtrap you'll ever need.</em>"

They have level 3 psychics (making them E-Tele targets) whose combo line is pretty competent and good at baiting negates. Normally, the PUNKs are used to make Halqdon lines, but for this list we opted for a pair of Rank 2 monster: Gossip Shadow and Break Sword. Gossip Shadow lets us set up a negate under Nibiru, and Break Sord is a great equalizer going second.  If you didn't want to run the PUNKs, I would recommend replacing them with Pot of Desires and another handtrap."

Featured archtype: Karakuri, Machina, Theroins', P.U.N.K., Infinitrack, Mor","Note: Ban list destroyed this deck. Will remain up, but only feasible in traditional format.  Really fragile, but notÂ  asÂ  fragile as the base Karakuri Strategy.  The plan is to go into Halq, get 001, then go into Auroradon. From there, you synchro into a Burei and bring out a Saizan to create another Burei. You Synchro Climb into Bureido using Gamas (Remember to use Gama in GY to draw 2), and then go into Bureibu.  Card Selection Breakdown:  The summary above can be the result of a single e-Tele (or just a Ze Amin Normal Summon). Of course, depending on your opening hand, the strategy might differ a bit. HereÂ  is why I run the cards I do.  Karakuri: Base for the deck. You generally don't want to draw into your Ninishi and Gamas. Kunamzan is best left in the deck, and you should only go into it when you have no other playÂ  other than Ready/Insta fusionÂ  + Kunamzan into a River Stormer.  Theorins': King Reggie is a safety net against interruptions. Having him on the board while you combo off is great for preventing Nibiru or a disruption. Remember, if Halq fizzles, you're pretty much fucked. I would run 3, but I found myself drawing into 2 Reggies when I only needed the one.  P.U.N.K: Main Combo Starter. A single E-Tele can take you from Ze Amin to a Bureibu. Standard combo is  Ele-Tele -&gt; Ze Amin -&gt; Madame Spider -&gt; Halq (into 001)Â  -&gt; Auroradon -&gt; 2 Bureis -&gt; 2 Bureidos -&gt; Bureibu and a Bureido  Machina: Great for setting up Reggie and getting bricks into your GY. Drawing into Redeployment and a Machina isn't generally bad, as you do run an Overdrive. You use Overdrive to recycle your Halq and other options. If you get into the fabled turn 3 and beyond, you can do a pretty nice loopÂ  of Recycling Tunneler with Overdrive to get back even more resources. Citadel is also an amazing piece of interruption.  Infinitrack: There mostly for Tunneler. Dozer and Trencher are cuttable, but Dozer searches out the Tunneler and I find myself in a lot of situations where I need to get myself back into the grind. I usually search Dozer w/ Heavy Forward to deck thin. I also pitch it for Theorins when I can.  Vernalizers: Extenders. Them being able to retrieve ANY earth is amazing. I don't want to draw into them too often tho. Never use these as your first move, as they'll lock you out of Halq, Auroradon and Baronne. Only use them to continue your combos once you're sure you have no other play.  Morphtronic: There to get you into Halq if you don't draw into any P.U.N.Ks.  Ready/Insta Fusion: As mentioned previously, here when you need an extra body on the field. You run Gyroid and Cyber Saurus because they're Earth Machines.Â  Using Kunamzan doesn't lock you out of themÂ  and Tunneler can recycle them - so they're perfect.  Destrudo: Another Tuner for Halq  Extra deck:  Run what you'll go into. The extra deck space isn't that right, as youÂ  can cut Infinitrack Goliath and Earth Slicer. I never go into them, and if I do, I'm probably losing that game anyways. However, Earth Slicer can be great going second.  You'll generally use up most of the Karakuris in your Combos, although I do find myself with a Single Bureibu left, often. Naturia Beast is perfect, and shuts down most decks - you can go into it with a Ninishi Special Summon with a Karakuri Synchro, and then normal summoning Inashichi.  Baronne is a great card, and you can go into it with a Ninishi + Machina Fortress. It's worth mentioning that it is Generic, so anyÂ  other combination ofÂ  cards in the deck can lead up to it.  &nbsp;"

I am only running 2x rite and 1x enchantress because enchantress is searchable off of Cherubini, and I run a lot of level 3 extenders so it is pretty easy to get to Cherubini. This gives me 3 cards I can open with that can start off the engine, and like around 20 different level 3s to make Cherubini to search enchantress. I run Dracoback because if you use it to discard for dragoons effect, it attaches to the token for a free bounce. I run 1 of all of the common handtraps because I run 3x Crossout. I also run the one scythe because I can cross it out, and if I do draw it I can set it and pop it off of Rusty's effect by reviving a break sword in grave to a zone he points to. I also choose to run dragoon over DPE beacause he is a tower and is harder to get around that DPE. Everyone a;ways forgets about the double pop+burn and that alone has ended games. Drawing red eyes fusion happens moderately often and it basically useless in hand, because Verte cannot get it into grave from the hand. If I do open red-eyes fusion, I can go through combo and dump Edge Imp Sabres, then use Edege Imp to put Red-Eyes Fusion back into the deck and Special summon itself,Â  then make Verte off of Cherubini + Edge or go into Rusty and continue combo. It's pretty solid and pretty consistent and you can basically play forever with stuff in the graveyard so the grind game is super good. I also has a really good OTK through Arc Rebellion and its pretty easy to play through a bunch of stuff and still end on arc rebellion for the OTK, especially if your opponent payed 2000 for verte. There are definitely better decks but I like PK so this is what I'm running to keep up with the meta decks running around."

Everything in the extra deck essentially serves as your toolbox or possible combo extenders if you're having issues with gas, which may be a problem since one of the main weaknesses of the deck is a bit of an inconsistency issue due to having to run three-ofs for every monster in the Skull Servant archetype, with half the monsters being unable to start any combos. Splashing in the Lightsworn support helps alleviate this issue, by giving access to powerful spells that will thin your deck, as well as easier synchro summons. While this deck isn't meta, it can still play through a lot of interrupts and OTK your opponent. Or, if you want to play more conservatively, you're able to still build beefy skeletons with modest protection that can really wall the other player."

Violet Crystal and Legendary Sword were the only Equips I could pull, so I have included Kagemusha, Fire Reaper, and Fiend's Hand - a more unreliable monster.

What could go wrong?","Video link in the description below  - Exo  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=6_VO1WHQjk4&amp;t="">https://youtube.com/watch?v=6_VO1WHQjk4&amp;t=</a> )  There isn't a lot to say about the ""Blackwings"" archetype as a whole. Needless to say, there shouldn't be too much to work with when it comes to this once powerful Synchro-era deck that was one of the first ""anime"" decks that made a singular top cut in any competitive Yu-Gi-Oh since after the GX era came to a close. However from RaidRaptors to Phantom Knights; Blackwings after their prime have been nothing short of a disorderly cluster of archetype reliance and incompetent mashups of DARK-attribute monsters that either want to push for XYZ extension, or forge some <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> traps that (up until now) have no significance whatsoever. If we happen to learn from now, not all decks from Yu-Gi-Oh's past and present would perform under the cards of the future no matter the circumstance. For Blackwings, this statement speaks no different for them and the reality has hit them hard on myself and others that had played them (and called them the deck that carried the 5Ds Era).  &nbsp;  First and foremost, the main concept for Blackwings over the years has either been in favor of Synchro summoning or has been lingering on other pieces (such as Raidraptors); however for this piece, I went with a mixture of a package that fits <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> ; the recently released synchro monster <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> ; and the usual Synchro mechanics without the dependency of the DARK-attribute because of Branded-Despia. Why I chose the card <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> as the go to LV7 over <a data-name=""Assault Blackwing-Raikiri the Rain Shower"">Assault Blackwing-Raikiri the Rain Shower</a> is because of this: the fact that <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> has the ability to manipulate it's attribute (and all attributes of other monsters on the field) into your favour when special summoned on the field. As a result of this, either I can go into <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> to <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> (mainly when DARK-attribute monsters are on my opponents field, and I don't have a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> ); or I can make her attribute into the DARK-attribute and force a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>Â on all non-Dark monsters on my opponents monsters. While this isn't the go to play for this deck (and it shouldn't be always relied on), it sometimes comes in handy in case you either want a board wipe or want to protect yourself in case you want to not risk a forced board wipe on your end with your Blackwings.  &nbsp;  Then comes the Synchro monsters that the archetype has been truly know for consistently push into during it's time in my trials. Besides <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> , the other LV7 that comes in play in case we can't get access to it is none other than <a data-name=""F.A Dawn Dragster"">F.A Dawn Dragster</a> (a Synchro monster that negates effects Spell/Trap effects at the cost of lower it's level by 2). Next comes <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> , who alongside <a data-name=""Blackwing-Oroshi the Squall"">Blackwing-Oroshi the Squall</a> is needed to get the powerful <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a> (a one tap negate anything that also revives a tuner monster if any battle damage is done). Finally from what I can go for, two options I can carve out are either <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> or <a data-name=""Blackwing Full Armor Master"">Blackwing Full Armor Master </a>. In this case, the most common choice (while I didn't necessarily feel any favoritism from either in this deck) was in from <a data-name=""Blackwing Full Armor Master"">Blackwing Full Armor Master</a> , and only due to being both a omni protector and a Mind Controller that can be used to sack valuable assets from your opponents (or to give them a bad time).  &nbsp;  Lastly comes the Fusion and Link Monsters picked by me; but while there were not too many to choose from, the options however weren't as farfetched as it was made out to be. For the <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> targets: my picks included <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> , <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> , andÂ  <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> . All of these were chosen because each fit a role of either being a sniping valuable assets off enemy boards of getting rid of problematic monsters (and then you got your Triphyoverutum, the Nuclear option for <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>). The Link monsters chosen were there to either act as supporting pieces or to be initial in screwing with your opponent. These link monsters include <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Lambda"">Psy-Frame Lambda</a> , <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy </a>, and <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World </a>.  &nbsp;"

Tuner monster. You can either Fusion summon to Rising Carp to summon 2 P.U.N.K. monsters from the deck or basically summon 2 monsters by normal or special summon. Then Link summon to Halqifibrax to special summon Deskbot 001 from the hand or deck. Proceed to Link summon to Auroradon to special summon 3 tokens and Deskbot 001 from the grave. (2nd Step) Synchro summon Herald of the Arc Light, then use the effect of Auroradon by tributing two tokens to special summon Coltwing. With this, your Coltwing will special summon two tokens, which led to Deskbot 001 to be special summoned from the GY (Reminder: Deskbot 001 is not a once per turn card). Use Coltwing (lvl 10 due to its effect) and Deskbot 001 to Synchro summon Amazing Dragon. Then, special summon a lvl 3 P.U.N.K. monster from the GY with the effect of Amazing Dragon.</span>  <span>With this setup, (3rd step) proceed to Synchro Summon Coral Dragon, then Synchro Summon the lvl 9 Karakuri boss monster. Then special summon a lvl 1 Karakuri tuner. With the lvl 9 Karakuri boss monster and a lvl 1 Tuner, proceed to Synchro summon Baronne de Fleur.</span>  <span><strong>Combo 2:</strong> Follow step 1 from the first combo, then Synchro Summon<strong>Â  C u p i dÂ  Â P i t c h </strong>(This one card can basically give you more opportunities to create stronger boards and negates. Nice!). Increase her level to 5 by her effect, then Special summon Coltwing by Auroradon's Effect (Yea expect Coltwing's effect and Deskbot 001's effect). Then, Synchro summon FIRST Amazing Dragon, then Borreload Savage Dragon by using Cupid Pitch and a token. With Cupid Pitch's effect, add Synchron Magnet to your hand, then proceed to activate Amazing Dragon's effect to summon a level 3 P.U.N.K. Monster from the GY. Synchro Summon Hi-Speedroid Kendama, a lvl 6 non-tuner machine monster, then activate Synchron Magnet's effect to special summon itself to the field. Then yea, do the usual Karakuri trick from the first combo to get a free Baronne.</span>  <strong><span>The difference between the two combos:Â </span></strong><span>The first combo has a floodgate effect from Herald of the Arc Light, yet vulnerable in battle. It also prevents you from activating cards like Maxx C and Droll and Lock Bird. The second combo, however, has 2 monsters with an Omni-negate and 3 high beatsticks. Since Herald is not present on the field, you can activate cards that has a requirement to be sent from the GY.</span>  <span>These two combos can surprisingly work with a single card (E. Teleport) or two cards (any random card and a Noh-P.U.N.K. monster). But k</span><span>eep in mind that this combo is very vulnerable to hand traps, so yeah, wish you luck on getting a Called by the grave or Crossout Designator in your starting hand. You can also play Droll and Lock Bird to counter Maxx ""C"", just in case you used the first combo, since that doesn't really require you to add cards from your hand to pull it off.</span>  <strong><span>Opponent's 1st Turn play:Â </span></strong><span>Umm... Wish your opponent is ass and not some meta slave Swordsoul DPE player??? What I can tell you, for now, is to negate and bait out opponent's cards as much as possible, depending on your starting hand. Use hand traps as well to disrupt the opponent's plays (or might as well try to make your opponent surrender, lol). Then, when it is your turn, try to pull off the One-Trick Board (either Combo 1 or Combo 2, depending on the situation). Also, keep in mind that you can activate only one of Amazing Dragon's effect each turn, so yea, be careful of your own activations to prevent a misplay.</span>  <strong><span>Reminders:Â </span></strong><span>This deck is not-so-perfect, as it is vulnerable by hand traps and negates. It also provides a tiny amount of bricks as well (unless if you really played well) so yeah bear with that. I do not recommend this deck to desperate Master Duel players that are trying to win Ranked Matches lol. Play this deck for fun, I guess. If you have any suggestions, leave it in the comments down below so that, yah, I can be informed on what improvements I could apply.</span>  <span>Oh yea btw you can use Dark Ruler No More and Lightning Storm, in hopes that you can make your own board with ease.</span>  <strong><span>Edit:Â </span></strong><span>Btw currently I'm in Platinum 2 with this deck. I can feel myself promoting to Diamond, so yah, wish me luck. And hey, last season, I played consistently at Diamond 3-4 with the first combo, which gives me a good conclusion that this works in Ranked. Good Luck.</span>"

This time I opted for only two dakki to see how that would go.  If youâre not familiar with the mayasaski ftk hereâs how it goes.  You use dakki (who has no opt on its text) to mash itself while owning a soul-absorbing bone tower. Every time you summon a zombie the bone tower will pitch the top two cards off of your opponents deck, if you do it enough (youâll usually do it enough) they deck out and you win by default because they canât draw.  But not only that, today I decided to make a rundown on the deck!  Yes, Iâll be giving you a guide to the list!  1 Doomking Balerdroch  Balerdroch is the star of this deck. Mayasaski lacks a competent boos monster and really can only do utility plays, Balerdroch is the boss monster coming from zombie world who can revive every turn and interrupts two times if you have a zombie world out! This card made zombie world decks much more competitive then they would be otherwise and in Mayasaski it is one of the best tools you could have.  1 Necroworld Banshee  Necroworld Banshee only has one relevant effect, if itâs on the field or graveyard it can activate Zombie world directly from the deck! The zombie world portion in this deck is mainly to make sure youâre safe if the ftk fails. I only used one necroworld banshee because I can very easily send it to the graveyard without any effort.  3 Gozuki  Gozuki does wonders in this deck, it pitches zombies and helps summon zombies zombies from your hand if youâre having trouble getting certain monsters out! All in all Gozuki is a solid tool that is recommended if you want to try your hand in nearly any zombie based deck.  3 Mezuki  Mezuki is sometimes the only reason your ftk works! Itâs text is pretty simple, you banish it from your grave to summon a zombie from your grave, no opt no catch, you mill it you get a summon. Itâs very helpful when youâre trying to get your soul absorbing bone tower out.  3 Shiranui Solitare  Solitare serves immense purpose in any zombie focused deck for its ability to be 3 additional copies of Uni-Zombie, one of the most helpful zombies in the game. Itâs second effect is cool but thereâs no using it in this particular deck.  3 Uni-Zombie  Uni-Zombie is an incredible card, it mills a zombie and lets you discard a card which is helpful with zombies sometimes. This card is insane and proves to be one of the best tuners printed to this day.  3 Soul Absorbing Bone Tower  This tower is the enabler of this deck, itâs two effects are simple. You canât attack it if you own a zombie other than itself and every time a zombie hits the field the top two cards of your opponents deck hits the graveyard. The main mayasaski combo summons so many zombies that the bone tower can deck out your opponent!  2 Dakki, the Graceful Mayasaski  Dakki is the reason why this works as well, the only effect you need to know is this one: âWhen a âMayasaskiâ monster(s) is special summoned to your field from your extra deck, while this card is in the GY (except during the damage step) you can special summon this cardâ. Thereâs no opt and the timing clause is that if you tuned it for a mayasaski synchro it can summon itself, each mayasaski synchro can be tuned by a level two tuner for another one two levels higher than the previous one except for the level 11 one, who gets linked and you simply repeat the process.  3 Hajun, the Winged Mayasaski  Hajun can summon dakki from the deck, who then tunes for the Wheeled Mayasaski as they quickly go up into a spiraling loop.  3 Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayasaski  Yuki-Musume is a mayasaski with the effect to summon itself and pitch any zombie from the deck to the graveyard making it relatively easy to set up the ftk, all in all it is an incredibly solid card being held back by its respective archetype.  1 Glow-Up Bloom  Bloom is capable of summoning bale from the deck, a good effect but due to only needing one bale and the sheer amount of zombies you can send I opted for only one.  3 Mayasaski Winter  Winter is a card that can transform attack points to virtually zero in Mayasaski, plus it provides a nifty draw effect and can revive zombies, in most decks this is a card not worth playing but in a deck like mayasaski playing this card is relatively safe  1 Zombie World  Zombie World is simple, everything you ever loved is a zombie now. Zombie World has an entire structure deck and even mor just normal decks built around it, it alone counters multiple decks including dinos, Dlink, Swordsoul, Tri-Brigades, and more! I only have the need for one because of banshee  3 Mayasaski Return  Simple text but incredible help, it literally just rotas or foolish burials a mayasaski card, doesnât even need to be a monster, so you can actually search the new mayasaski trap with it.  1 One for One  Simple enough for you? Thereâs seven total level one monsters in this deck. The main purpose of this card is to make summoning Hajun easier.  3 Ghost Meets Girl - a Mayasaski and Shiranuiâs Tale  The newest mayasaski support, Ghost Meets Girl is a vanities ruler for zombies and even goes as far as to recycle a banished zombie! This card is simply insane with an effect that ends turns and.  3 Shiranui Style Swallowâs Slash  Swallowâs Slash is a handy card for interruption with two instant pops and is generally used in zombie decks in general.  2 Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayasaki  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with an immunity effect  2 Yoko, the Graceful Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with a monster pop  2 Tengu, the Winged Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with spell/trap removal  2 Tsuchigumo the Poisonous Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with even more milling lol  2 Orboro-Guruma the Wheeled Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with battle protection  1 Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayasaski  Yuki-Onna comes with two negates in response to graveyard summons, making it a really solid counter to certain decks.  2 Yuki-Onna the Icicle Mayasaski  Mayasakiâs newest link monster! This link three allows mayasaski to do ftks even more efficiently with its reviving effect! Overall this card is very helpful for the deck in general!  2 Yuki-Onna the Ice Mayasaki  Mediocre card meant for link climbing  &nbsp;  So what happens with all of these mills, and how many do you usually aim to get?  Well, thatâs simple  Each time Dakki summons two gets pitched, each time the extra deck summons two more gets pitched,  4 gets pitched from Orboro and Dakki  4 more gets pitched from Tsuchigumo and Dakki  4 more gets pitched from Tengu and Dakki  4 more goes bye from Yoko and Dakki  4 more incinerates from Gashadokuro and Dakki  Another 4 from Yuki-Onna and Dakki  Another 4 from the link 3 Yuki-Onna and Dakki  Another 4 from the link 4 Yuki-Onna and Dakki  The link 3 Yuki-Onna revives Orboro which tosses another 2  Tsuchigumo and Dakki throws out another 4  Tengu and Dakki Tosses out another 4  Yoko and Dakki for another 4  Gashadokuro and Dakki pitches 4 more  Yuki-Onna and Dakki for 4  and the link 3 Yuki-Onna and Dakki for a finishing 4  How many was that? 58 cards milled in one sequence, you can deck out a 60 card deck with that, mayasaski used to have trouble with that!  Strengths of this deck:  This deck can shut down a lot of options for your opponents and also doesnât have much trouble preforming an ftk as well  Mayasakiâs endboard will consist of one monster who floats 5 times and occasionally Bale and a lock to summoning  This deck is incredibly fun to play  Weaknesses of this deck:  You have no room in your extra because Mayasaski demands a lot of space in the extra  Mayasaski lacks a direct negate and has to rely on other things  A single handtrap is all it takes to kill this deck at times  This deck is one of the easiest Nib targets in the game  Overall I really like this deck! I have a lot of fun decking out my opponents through this deck and pitching so many cards is really funny for me."

The strategy is still basically the same: <a data-name=""Spellbook of Fate"">Spellbook of Fate</a> + <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>, but it's just more optimized and runs way better. PS: The deck is not Meta. There are a thousand of better Dogmatika builds, that are Meta contenders, this is not. <ul>  	<li>Cuts: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Magician of Chaos"">Dark Magician of Chaos</a>(1 to 0) - I was using it as a <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> target, but as the comments said, it's not worth it. Also, I was drawing it way more than needed.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""High Priestess of Prophecy"">High Priestess of Prophecy</a>(2 to 0) - Too bricky, there are better targets to souls now, like <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a>(2 to 1) - Since I mostly used this as interruption after the combo as an add from <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, using multiples caused me to draw the card, which was bricking.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>(3 to 2) - Banlist. That's all.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Spellbook of Power"">Spellbook of Power</a>(2 to 0) - It was just too situation to ever use it. And it was the card I was mostly siding anyways.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""The Grand Spellbook Tower"">The Grand Spellbook Tower</a>(1 to 0) - I just don't know why I was even running this card, it was just souls target, which we have better ones.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Spellbook of Eternity"">Spellbook of Eternity</a>(2 to 1) - In the past, I thought I needed 2 for consistency, but I know now that you will mostly just copy the effect of it with <a data-name=""Spellbook of Master"">Spellbook of Master</a>, which is way more important.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Spellbook of Wisdom"">Spellbook of Wisdom</a>(1 to 0) - The card is still on the decklist, but it's totally optional. It can make you brick, or it can be clutch, it depends too much.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Adds/New Cards: <ul>  	<li>Handtraps - I was dumb. Sorry. Not running handtraps nowadays is already a lose. In this build, I'm using <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, as bridges to <a data-name=""Crystron Halqfibrax"">Crystron Halqfibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker, but those are your pick.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> + <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites - Illusion of Chaos is a card that didn't existed, so that's why I wasn't using it. You can replace it with </a><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>, but it stops you from activating <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> - The deck was losing a lot to other control decks in game 1, so I just had to add something to stop at least 1 of the set cards.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Side Deck Changes: Those changes are not as important, since it's not your main form of dealing with the opponent, but it's still relevant. I'm not gonna point all of them, since like I said, you can just change whatever you want on it. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> - Kinda weird to use this, but it was being very clutch when needed. Can also send materials to activate <a data-name=""Spellbook of Fate"">Spellbook of Fate</a>, which happens more than it looks time.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a> - By itself, this card CAN kill decks. Like I said, can. That's why it's on side deck. Neither of the decks on this build care about it, since most of them are Spellcasters and you can just play around it.</li>  	<li>Nibiru, the Primal Being - Kaboom? Any tier 3 or lower combo deck dies to this, no reason to not play if you're in game 2 or if you know your opponent deck, you can even main it.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Some Side Notes: <ul>  	<li>Comments also gave some tips about using 3 <a data-name=""Secret Village of Spellcasters"">Secret Village of Spellcasters</a>, but when I played it, I was just drawing it with no Spellcasters, which is a brick. So I think 2 are ok, but now with searching <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>, I'm not that certain anymore.</li>  	<li>Also from the comments, user @<i class=""fa fa-user""></i>kissbandit suggested some cards, between those were: <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru - Good card, but I always have protection with Spellbook of Wisdom, which I'm already considering cutting.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Sorcerer"">Chaos Sorcerer </a>- Interesting pick, but not playable, the Dogmatika engine already uses all, if not most, of Dark attribute monsters for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> summon, which means his summon would clash with that engine.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Quintet Magician"">Quintet Magician</a> + <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a> - You put it as trolling, but I tested it seriously. It's not that bad. If you're using <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, that's even easier to summon. Now saying all of that, you are using Main and Extra Deck spaces, which can brick, so it's not that consistent.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>This is becoming comments suggestions by now, but as user @Yugituber said, you can use Invoked engine on it, but you can be careful about your Normal Summons. Other than that, it works just fine, as seen on the user @toe build-<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-spell-book/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-spell-book/</a></li>  	<li>Brave Engine - That's one I'm temped to, but I will not be using it. It can improve the deck a lot, but it can also hurt the deck. In a way, it's optional to the user.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Old Post:<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/spellbook-dogmatika-3/""> https://ygoprodeck.com/spellbook-dogmatika-3/</a> Original @toe Post:Â <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-spell-book/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-spell-book/</a>"

Dark world deck on ygoprodeck.com ,"<h1><span>1. General danger inclusionÂ </span></h1> <span>For danger we want to draw all of them but not multiples of the same card. However there are ways to get around this with certain effects and with the amount of copies of each card we put into the deck. We also have to keep in mind what we can do with the extra deck in terms of levels. So with that out of the way we did not include <a data-name=""Danger! Dogman!"">Danger! Dogman! because the card does, in a worse way, what the rest of the deck already does which is deal with our opponents field. We also don't include Dogman because the deck doesn't have any level 7 xyz and we generally don't want to summon and </a><a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a> as Nessie's discard effect is much more helpful to search for either jackalope or to get our level 4's or 8's which tend to have a much greater impact in general. The only other inclusion which might be different is only including two <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! </a><a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Chupacabra! This is because as helpful as the discard effect is you must have a danger! card in your GY for it to be helpful. Therefore we only run two of them</a></span> <h1><span>2. Dark World Inclusion</span></h1> <span>Generally we run less darkworld monsters because on their own they are dead draws. However paired with Danger! monsters they provide amazing effects for the deck. We run <a data-name=""Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World"">Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World because he's a free summon when discarded. We can also use </a><a data-name=""Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World"">Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World to return Beiige to our hand and later summon him again. Therefore we only run two of him along with only two Grapha. Grapha is nice as when discarded he offers us destruction along with the fact he basically makes the rest of the dark world monsters level 8s in addition to their level, like I said he bounces other darkworld monsters to hand to special summon himself from the GY. We run three </a><a data-name=""Snoww, Unlight of Dark World"">Snoww, Unlight of Dark World as she can search for all of our dark world cards that I will talk about later along with the fact we can use her to summon Grapha from the GY or just as a level four if we're desperate. Last but not least is </a><a data-name=""Broww, Huntsman of Dark World"">Broww, Huntsman of Dark World he gives us additional card draw, lets us get Grapha from the GY, and works with our other graveyard interaction that I'll touch on later. We run three however running Broww as a two of isn't going to hurt the deck.Â </a></span> <h1><span>3. Spells and tra... oh wait there's only spells </span></h1> <span>So there are only spells in the deck because the deck is a combo deck. The goal is to combo into basically your entire extra deck or to combo into enough monsters to unalive your opponent. First off we start with our only danger spell. Danger! Response team is in the deck for a few reasons and can fix a lot of problems Danger! can encounter. Any card that can't be destroyed by battle or card effects or is just immune to monsters in general, a good example being Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops which danger darkworld would only be able to deal with using the extra deck. On top of that Response team can also be used to guarantee discards of nessie or jackalope who 90% of the time you don't want to summon. So you can either keep response team in your hand and try to discard it to use it's effects later or set it if you know you're gonna want to bounce a monster back to hand. Next up are the darkworld spells which are much more basic. Dark World Dealings is a spell that lets both you and your opponent draw 1 card and discard one card. The initial use is obvious because you want to discard cards but it also works with the dark charmer and Fabled Andwraith in the extra deck. Next is Gates of the dark world which acts as another dark world dealings that works well with Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite. We only run one of them because it can be searched with snoww and drawing more than one would give us more dead cards that we don't need.  </span>  <span>In terms of generic spells that aren't Danger! or Darkworld we run two allure of darkness, two pot of avarice, a card destruction and a monster reborn. The two allure only let us go even in terms of cards but can easily save us from bad hands or get the deck out of any tough spots. We generally dump darworld cards but if you have two of the same Danger! monster in your hand and you don't have many cards then banishing a Danger! monster can sometimes be a option. Pot of avarice is nice as we end up having a ton of monsters in the GY and you can easily avarice twice in the same turn. Especially with how we construct our extra deck. Next is card destruction which doesn't really need a explanation. Every card in our deck except most of our spells we want to discard. It also works with pot of avarice and helps put cards like Grapha into the graveyard. Monster reborn is the last spell and always gets us out of any sticky situation if we don't have theÂ  correct monsters on the board to xyz or link summon. It can also be used to steal some monsters from our opponents GY that works quite well with some of our extra deck that I'll address later.</span> <h1><span>Extra Deck with some alternatives</span></h1> <span>For the extra deck some of it is because we're on somewhat of a budget and some are just necessary for the deck to be good both going first and second. Generally Danger! Darkworld wants to go second as the large amount of destruction effects allows this deck to play around a wide number of negates. However, the first three extra deck monsters help the deck go first with extra value and creating some scary board presence. The first of which is probably the strangest card in the extra deck but a card I've had too much success with not to put it in. That card being Fabled Andwraith and the one of card we put in the main deck just for it which is The Fabled Cerburrel. Now I have this card in for extra draw as the opponent could discard a card to negate Fabled Andwraith's first effect however this deck goes so positive on card draw that this trade isn't worth it a lot of the time for the opponent. This also counters certain decks I've personally been seeing more recently, that being adventure, certain phantom knight decks/engines, and some cyber dragon. It can obviously deal with more decks and works well against hand traps in general. This is because most hand traps get discarded from hand to graveyard so if they Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, ghost ogre, or droll (it works on more these are just the most common ones I see) you still get the summon.Â </span>  <span>Next Is Number 38 who negates a spell on field which will in any case slow down the opponent. It's quite easily to get out and can be used to summon megaclops who will get us more value later. With 38's new reprint in Second Haunting he's more than affordable.Â </span>  <span>last but no least for our strange but effective cards for going first is The Zombie Vampire. She gets us a summon from the top four cards of either players deck. This not only helps fill your GY but there's also a chance to get your opponents boss monster for free as it doesn't negate the summoned monsters effects. This can also give another card the extra deck Dark Charmer, Gloomy a chance to be used on turn 1 letting you go into even more extra deck monsters.</span>  <span>Now for the stranger part of the extra deck but in my opinion very versatile and quite effective. This is of course our Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon, Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon, and Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon. The first one, Cipher dragon, allows you to take control of an opponents monster and use it as xyz material for the other two galaxy-eyes monsters you have. Granted you do have to remember this basically takes away your ability to OTK your opponent but it gets around destruction effects. Then the other two dragons can be xyz summoned using either the stolen monster or just using Cipher dragon. You can summon full photon over cipher dragon, destroy a card, then summon cipher blade over to destroy another card. This is just a whole lot of value for a very easy to summon set of cards. Note at the time of making this you can buy each of these cards for a dollar or less.Â </span>  <span>Finally in the extra deck you have you're very basic monsters. I:P to summon Borrelsword Dragon, Raiders knight used to summon Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon who is also used as a very easy otk that your opponent has to negate in some way. Finally there's number 60 who's used to extend your turn by letting you draw and discard, he's also useful to summon Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops who we put into the deck because it still lets any of your already used/negated xyz monsters still be useful and some decks just struggle to deal with Megaclops.

I've just been avoiding this deck because it left an unpleasant taste in my mouth due to people constantly staining it with Brave Tokens, but yeah.  I apologize if I don't have anything insightful to say for today about this list because, you know... life stuff, also because I think this is, for the most part, pretty self-explanatory and Master Duel's format is still wack. Anyway, here's the list and as per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments, which I think is better so that I could deal with more specific concerns if any rather than just generalizing my answers, and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

Fusion and Synchro main monsters, but only one copy of 1 out of 3 Main Deck SR monsters. While trying to gather more gems, I had an idea.  And I thought it was gonna be terrible, but it's not that bad, actually?  Enter this mashed deck of the LiveâTwins, the new P.U.N.K. cards, and a small dash of Destiny HEROs because dear god the new Fusion is good AND I somehow pulled it. And while I don't have enough EvilâTwin cards to support the LiveâTwins, I did happen to have a decent amount of Code Talkers and a copy of Firewall Dragon to support the literal one Link Ki-sikil I have. If you wanna have a run at this deck and you DO happen to own more of the EvilâTwin Links, it honestly might be a good idea to just chuck the Code Talkers out to make room for them. Similar notes for anyone who actually owns any other missing cards - LiveâTwin spells like Secret Password, P.U.N.K. monsters like Foxy Tune, etc. But you might have to swap some cards in and out. Iblee might also be a good idea for all the Link monsters, but for the time being, I left her out.  Tested this out in Ranked while trying to get more gems, and honestly? Not that bad! Would probably perform better if I actually had more of the cards, but it did win me a few duels. Certainly went a lot better than other 2-Archetype decks I've tried to make work. I've actually won with this deck in comparison to them.  Still a WIP for the obvious reasons, but this deck may have actual potential."

The Ojamas call for aid!""","So, horrible (amazing?) realization - the ironically Thunder-type Splights support specifically Level 2 monsters. You know what archetype is JUST Level 2s that certainly need some help? Ojamas.  With their powers combined, Ojamas can potentially speed up! Or at least get some kind of assistance when the Splights are on the board, boosting and protecting them. The Splights also aren't really affected by cards like Ojama Country. Some'll actually get a stronger attack because of it! Ojamas can also go into the Splight's Extra Deck monsters, so if you can't get out any of the monsters to block off part of the opponent's board, get one of them out instead. Mix up board blocks with the Level 2 protections, and blast your opponent away as soon as you can, before they crush you right back.  Some quick cards I wanna go over:  <strong>Tri-Wight</strong> is essentially Ojamandala, but better. There's no LP payment for getting the main 3 Ojamas out. You can also play Ojama Delta Hurricane immediately after, and it makes summoning Ojama Emperor with them a lot easier.  <strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong> is the closest we're ever gonna get to an Ojama Xyz monster. It only takes Beast monsters, which means you can't put the Splights into it as material, but you can protect it, and that's very important because two of them out on the field in defense essentially creates a wall. Number 64 can't be destroyed by battle or card effect as long as there's a Beast-type monster out, so if you need to make sure you don't get blasted through, get two out to buy some time. Your opponent either has to negate their effect before attacking, or banish them, which the Splights can prevent. Their effect also lets them create a token that gains ATK equal to the highest ATK on the field at that moment, and what's better is that this ATK stat isn't affected by Ojama Country. So you can get a token out, then get an Ojama out to swap the stats of everyone on the field, letting only you keep any stupidly high ATK. I didn't include the other two raccoon cards used for Number 64, really because Splights are pretty good themselves to back up the Ojamas. If you wanna try and get Number 64 out faster, DNA Surgery could help, but it might not be worth it.  <strong>Recycling Batteries</strong> is recovery specifically for the Splights in the deck. Play it, and you've got two of them back in your hand immediately, good to go for immediate use. Alternatively, you can swap this card out for Pot of Avarice to draw two cards to put monsters of either archetype back, but you don't get the protection guaranteed back into your hand. Personally, I think Recycling Batteries is a better idea, since Ojamas can recover on their own with their field spell and Tri-Wight. But both cards are a good idea, considering you're gonna have a lot of monsters piling up in that graveyard.  I haven't tested this deck yet, so I don't know if it'll actually work as intended, but it's just really funny - especially since Splights would work a lot better with other Level 2 monsters like the LiveâTwins, who are specifically dedicated to this sorta thing. But it's a deck for fun, anyways. Heck, if you wanna go really crazy, try smushing them in here too."

There are some wild combos here, and some good tech plays, and very little fluff.  Tuned the Extra Deck a little - 2 Mechaba seems pretty standard rn for NS Aleister, but this list never needed 2 Mechaba, and using 2 slots on Mechaba and Artemis meant being a little shy on Mirror Jade targets, and particularly short on Lubellion. 1 Albaz is fine in this list - you have to manage resources well, so try not to banish the Albaz for Shaddolls until you're really done with him. Otherwise, he's fine - he's a mini-super poly which is good bait, and a good super poly target, so there are worse bricks in a lot of decks, even if I'm not thrilled Konami got me playing Fallen of Albaz.  No side deck, because that will vary based on the meta. In a deck like this, a high volume of high-quality generic interruptions are necessary, and the mix in the main is fine, so I'd advise a lot of 1 and 2 of tech calls for a deck like this, and to avoid relying on ""silver bullets"" for a matchup game plan, because in a 60 card list with no Pots and DPE but no Verte you're going to struggle to see any of your side tech, so you have to want to side it often. This list is pretty sick. I think the leaner, tighter Snow list might be overall stronger, but this list is strong, consistent, and has a comparably high ceiling (maybe higher sometimes?), but lacks some of that linearity of play."

If you have the Rngesus on your side this will be your best deck. Lightsworn has so much potential. ,"Disclaimer: This deck will make your opponents cry.  This deck has many good win conditions. You can easily Link climb with knightmares and Accesscode to clear the field and then set up negates. Just have to believe in the power of RNG.  You start off with trying to dump your deck into the gy and then work from there. Chaos space + collapserpent/wyverbuster gives you a good start. Always try to add chaos creator with chaos space. Chaos dragon almost always fixes your hand and gy, its a good card. DONT OVER EXTEND. Remember to keep at least 1 Dark and 1 Light monster in grave. Levianeer is a good extender too, i usually use the special summon from gy effect. To bring backÂ  level 4 tuner.  This deck is also good against control decks. Use Underworld to get rid of problematic monsters (Plasma, Dragoon, etc..) Bagooska can stall out a field of negates if they arent playing link monsters. Gren Maju can beat over anything in the late game. Kristya will activate your opponents effect ""Cry"". Feel free to make adjustments to extra deck. Ive tried to add zeus but doesnt come up often.  Most of all this deck is fun to play but very competitive. Takes a lot of practice to get the big picture of this deck. Side deck is still in progress.

There have been lots of new releases related to token and token support, enough to actually build a specialised deck.</span>  The question of course: ""is it viable?"", well that's up to the deck and the people wielding and improving the deck.  At the moment this <strong>token only deck or (T.O.D)</strong> for short is more of a <strong>control deck</strong> than anything else. It has lots of monster effect negation and card destruction. It does really well <strong>going first</strong> with this deck.  There is a new card called ""Parasomnia Pillow"" that has not been widely released yet, but is available in it's Japanese form which can be played on <a><strong>dueling nexus</strong></a> for the time being as a pre-release. I do believe the equip card has potential to boost the performance of this deck and is great to use on your opponent's monsters.  <strong>Parasomnia Pillow effect:</strong>  <span id=""card-description"">During the End Phase: You can destroy the equipped monster. If this card is sent to the GY because the equipped monster was destroyed and sent to the GY: Special Summon 1 ""Parasomnia Token"" (Level 1/ATK ?/DEF 0) with the equipped monster's original Type, Attribute, and ATK, then equip this card to that Token. You can only use each effect of ""Parasomnia Pillow"" once per turn.</span>  <strong>Strategy</strong>  <span>It's always good to have ""</span><span>Pacifis, the Phantasm City"" on the field. When summoning any tokens you can then add any ""Phantasm Spiral"" trap card to your hand, of which is immediately playable.</span>  I do believe a lot of people are already aware of the ""Brave engine"" and how good it is, which does make this deck shine really well. The ""Brave engine's"" equip spell ""Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon"" can be used on any token and bounce big extra deck monsters back into the extra deck.  Effect rulings on tokens are also slightly different on tokens than on monsters, since they don't go to the GY or can be banished, some effects cannot be used on tokens, for example ""Eater of million's"" effect. You may want to brush up on effect rulings for tokens.  This is by no means a meta deck, but is pretty decent. Hope you have fun!"

The first deck I planned building after coming back to Yugioh 5 years after having duels at school with crazy old cards. Ended up building RDA over it but hey it's whatever.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>First decklist I made for a ZARC deck was absolutely abhorrent as I had zero clue what I was doing. When I played with friends, stuff like Blue Eyes was impossible to get over. Took me a while to learn new Yugioh (especially Pendulum) and here I am now with the last version of Z-ARC I'll be making.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>ã MAIN DECK ã</span>  <span>â¥ Monsters:Â </span>  <span>Pretty basic Pendulum Magician stuff but with extras, because this deck is about Z-ARC, not building a board of 8 negates after a 10 minute turn.Â </span>  <span>Black Fang, White Wing, Purple Poison, Oafdragon, and Wisdom-Eye all at 2. Black Fang / White Wing / Purple Poison can all be scales, but their main purpose is to be material for Z-ARC. We're not running any of the actual Extra Deck requirements for Z-ARC, just the main deck substitutes. Oafdragon as a good low scale, and to grab a card from the ED. Wisdom-Eye is there to place scales as per usual.</span>  <span>Astrograph, Chronograph, Darkwurm, Gate Zero, Celestial Magician, Arc Pendulum, Deskbot 001, and O-Lion all at 1. The Sorcerers are pretty obviously there to summon Z-ARC, or be used as Link fodder to send em back to the Extra Deck. Darkwurm can be used as a play starter, using things like Foolish Burial or Dragon Shrine to send it to the GY and then use it's effect to summon it. Gate Zero is a great low scale that also has a decent but not very useful effect when we have Z-ARC out. Deskbot 001 and O-Lion are there for the Halq / Auroradon Synchro combo, but I'll get to that later.</span>  <span>Skullcrobat at 3 because it's Skullcrobat, no explanation needed. Free search for a Normal Summon.Â </span>  <span>â¥ Spells &amp; Traps:</span>  <span>Raigeki and Reborn as just basic and useful spells. You can replace these with more handtraps like Veiler or good going second cards like Lightning Storm or Droplet. I just like the cards themselves because they're OG but still useful. Though I have been considering swapping them for Droplet.</span>  <span>Pendulum Call and Duelist Alliance as more searches. Pretty basic stuff. Pendulum Call is only at 2 because we do use Pendulum effects decently often with Wisdom Eye and Oafdragon. Star Pendulumgraph for Scale protection and draw power when you bring out Electrumite.Â </span>  <span>Dragon Shrine and Foolish Burial are here to quickly get either Darkwurm or the Magicians needed for Z-ARC. If you get Dragon Shrine, send Arc Pendulum so the second effect procs and you can send another Dragon, aka Darkwurm. That's why I use Arc Pendulum rather than the original, because it's a Normal monster which means Dragon Shrine can be used at full potential.</span>  <span>Imperm is pretty obvious. Just a good negate. You can once again swap it out for whatever else you want.Â </span>  &nbsp;  <span>ã EXTRA DECK ã</span>  <span>â¥ Fusions:Â </span>  <span>2 Supreme Starving Venom and 1 copy of the main boss itself, Z-ARC. For obvious reasons. Z-ARC is an underrated boss monster. 4K beater, can't be targeted or destroyed, blows up enemy field on summon, and can summon a Starving Venom (or any other Supreme Kings you might be running) whenever it destroys a monster by battle. Only problem with it is how hard it is to summon, but with this deck its fairly easy, and there are other monsters you can go for.Â </span>  <span>â¥ Synchros:Â </span>  <span>Herald of the Arc Light is a good negate and also has an effect like Dark Law which banishes stuff instead of them being sent to the GY. This alone counters a ton of decks, especially meta decks like Drytron or Admancipator, which use their GY as a field of its own with tons of effects. It also has the Stardust Dragon tribute-to-negate effect. Wonder Magician is a free card pop (can be used on your scales like Double Iris to grab a Pendulumgraph). Borreload Savage is there for obvious reasons, it's THE best generic Synchro atm and not much will change that.Â </span>  <span>â¥ XYZ:</span>  <span>Utopic Future and Draco Future are there for when you get 2 Timestars or a Bagooska on the field. Overlay them for a good negator that can't be destroyed and has a decent body + stealing potential. Timestar is there pretty obviously to search for your Magicians. Bagooska is for when you either get negated, have a bad hand, or don't want to play through a Maxx C.Â </span>  <span>â¥ Links:</span>  <span>Halqifibrax is the heart the Synchro combo. Electrumite is a must in any Pendulum Magician deck. It makes Astrograph basically always be on your field, can destroy a card for an effect like Double Iris, gives you draw power, and has good Arrows.Â </span>  <span>Auroradon is there, once again, for the synchro combo. Spawns tokens on summon, tributes itself and 1 token to summon O-Lion.Â </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Apollousa is the best Link monster negate and is easy to make, with generic materials. Once per CHAIN negate??? Of course Apollousa is in here. If you don't want another negate, use something like Accesscode or Borrelsword.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>ã SIDE DECK ã</span>  <span>â¥ You can run DPE instead of the Synchro combo package if you want, I just don't run it because I don't find it fun.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>That's about it, Z-ARC is one of my favorite cards and while this deck might not be too competitive, it is incredibly fun thinking of all the combos and managing all the needed Magicians to big brain Z-ARC out as fast as possible.Â </span>"

You could go into Joyous Melffys instead of Melffy of the Forest if you have Melffy Hide-and-Seek or Melffy Tag. Once you have Melffys of the Forset on the field you can go into Joyous Melffys. Joyous is nice for its quick effect allowing you to special summon monsters from the graveyard. The best targets to go for are Melffy Catty, Melffy Puppy, and Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest. Melffy Catty allows you to search cards from the deck, Melffy Puppy allows you to summon from your deck, and Kalantosa allows you to destroy one of your opponent's cards. Kalantosa is one main way to get rid of cards in this deck. Alpha, the Master of Beast is a quick way to get a powerful 3000 ATK monster out on the field with the benefit of returning cards to your opponent's hand. It's one of the best cards due to its ease of summoning and ability to get rid of cards with protection.  Have fun running this deck :)"

The starters are Sharakusai and Ze Amin, or Foxy Tune, Ogre Dance, or Emergency Teleport, which can all search the first two P.U.N.K.s mentioned. Sharakusai with any P.U.N.K. in hand turns into Rising Carp, which then turns into two level three P.U.N.K.s (usually Ze Amin if you haven't already used her, or Madame Spider and Wa Gon). If you started with Ze Amin instead, search Foxy Tune if you haven't already used it, or any level 3 P.U.N.K. if you have. Now that you have two tuners on the field, go into Halq, summon 001, then into Aurorodon, summoning back 001. From here, go into One of the two Cupid Pitch's, increasing the level by one. Then summon our Coltwing from deck using Aurorodon, summoning back 001. Go into your second Cupid Pitch, decreasing its level by one. Now you can make Borreload Savage Dragon, and F.A. Dawn Dragster or Clear Wing Fast Dragon. Remember to use Cupid Pitch's effect to search a monster with 600 Def from deck (all of our level 3 P.U.N.K.s meet this condition). Remember to activate your P.U.N.K. effects to search for cards, like Madame Spider and Wa Gon.  &nbsp;  At this point, your graveyard is pretty full so you can use a Pot of Avarice to net two more cards. Its very possible that you still haven't normal summoned, and if so we can either normal a Sharakusai to Synch off into an Amazing Dragon or Psychic End Punisher during the opponents turn, or use our Sharakusai to extend further if we have not yet used his effect. In that case, we can make Rising Carp, using Carp to search a level 3 P.U.N.K. and Deer Note. Synch these two into Chaos Ruler, using Chaos Ruler's effect to search and Deer Note's effect to bring back Sharakusai which we can Synch off with Chaos Ruler during the opponent's turn."

Its primary purpose is the summoning and control of Blue-eyes White Dragons and Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon. This is accomplished through the use of Maiden's with eyes of Blue and both White Stone variants. Its protections come marginally from spell and traps. Instead its primary field protections are in the summon and use of its synchro summon Azure-Eyes. Not a deck for beginner's nor for tournament play. For as many strengths and plays as this deck has it is constructed with just as many exploits and weaknesses. Its design set to challenge opponents and inspire them to come back for another try.

No this is not a good deck and no it was not made with the banlist in mind (younger me would have probably thought you where lying when you told him that Pot of Greed was banned from play or that you where only allowed one monster reborn) so there are some issues there. Although I do still think that some of these old school cards could work in other decks (namely <a data-name=""D.D. Scout Plane"">D.D. Scout Plane</a> and <a data-name=""Sacred Crane"">Sacred Crane</a>.) It did have some changes made to it around 2012 when Legendary Collection 3 released so this is the final form of it. Judging from the cards I picked for it I think the idea is to summon big beaters like the <a data-name=""Summoned Skull"">Summoned Skull, </a><a data-name=""Guardian Eatos"">Guardian Eatos or </a><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier</a><a data-name=""Summoned Skull""> and attack for game with some consistency from </a><a data-name=""Sacred Crane"">Sacred Crane</a><a data-name=""Summoned Skull"">, </a><a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a><a data-name=""Summoned Skull""> and </a><a data-name=""Witch of the Black Forest"">Witch of the Black Forest (I have </a><a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a><a data-name=""Witch of the Black Forest""> in it as well but forgot to put it in the when I used the deck builder) in order to thin the deck and get what I need.</a>"

I decided to do Cyberdark dragons since we just got the structure deck in master duel, it also includes live matches as well. The main purpose of the deck is to get into Cyberdark end dragon and attach destruction sword to it to prevent our opponent from using the extra deck.  We can also otk with the deck but I will say we are less consistent with OTKing on draw than regular cyber dragons.  &nbsp;  The deck is super fun and let me know how you liked the video!"

Other Archetype cards that catch my attention are <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> and <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> because they are the only way for Fluffal to <strong>interact in the opponent's turn</strong> via the engine. This is an underrated deck mainly because in the last few years since its last supports players have focused on a <strong>unique Win Condition</strong> for when the deck goes first like making <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> (VFD) and <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> lock. Of course, when you resolve these cards victory is practically guaranteed but the <strong>Fluffal engine itself has the potential to make End Boards with many versatile interactions</strong> without having to resort to cards that end up on the Banlist sooner or later. VFD has been banned for a long time and Artifact Scythe is next on the list, so the way I'm going to present what Fluffal gameplay I consider the safest because no matter what the next banlist is this deck will continue with the same power level as long as many other decks in the meta will take heavy hits which will <strong>lower their powercreep relative to Fluffal</strong>. I had already made a presentation of the deck in <strong>Fusion format</strong>: https://ygoprodeck.com/fluffal-fusion-format-may22/ and basically this is the continuation of how the deck plays in <strong>Traditional format</strong>. Of course, combos and things I said in that format are also valid for this one, but as the extra deck is not restricted, you can do more advanced combos.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combos:</strong> Let's start with small card combinations that complement the combos I talked about in the previous profile deck:  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 1: Dog + Patchwork (Blind Second OTK)</strong>  NS <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> and eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a>  Activate <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> Add <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> SS Sheep and eff return Dog to Hand and SS Edge Imp Chain LINK-2 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> and Edge Imp Chain eff Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> Activate Frightfur Fusion summon <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>(banish Sheep and Edge Imp Chain) Activate Polymerization Fusion <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a>(same Zone Cross-Sheep)(using Kraken and Dog) Sabre-Tooth eff Reborn Kraken cl1 and Cross-Sheep eff Reborn Dog cl2  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-37309876  Gamestate: Cross-Sheep + Dog + Saber-Tooth + Kragen = <strong>10400damage</strong>  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 2: (Dog + Edge Imp Chain) + Random Discard (Blind Second)</strong>  NS <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> and eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> and eff discard to GY to Set <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> from Deck Activate Toy Vendor and eff Discard <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> to DRAW 1 and Special or Discard Edge Imp Chain eff Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> and Activate Patchwork Add <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>  Activate Polymerization and Fusion <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> (using Dog and Sabres and [Summon in the <strong>Middle Zone</strong> Column]) Cruel Whale eff Destroy Toy Vendor and Opponent's Card ***Toy Vendor eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> and Cruel Whale eff tgt itself send <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> to GY Frightfur Repair eff banish from GY to Special Dolphin from Hand Dolphin eff Set Toy Vendor and Foolish <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> Activate Toy Vendor and eff Random discard to DRAW 1 and Special or Discard Wings eff banish itself and Bear from GY to DRAW 2 and Send Toy Vendor to GY and Toy Vendor eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> SS Sheep from Hand and eff Return Dolphin SS Edge Imp Chain from GY LINK-2 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> and Edge Imp Sabres eff Reborn from GY(zone Cross-Sheep points to) and Cross-Sheep eff Reborn Dog  To finish the OTK you have several ways: If you have Polymerization = Fusion <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> using Dog and Sabers (Kraken Attack Twice) If you use LINK-4 other than Apollousa: you can do <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or Knightmare Unicorn and then <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>.  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38957033 Gamestate: Cruel Whale + Cross Sheep + Dog + Edge Imp Sabers /in Hand: 1 DRAW + Dolphin /Total DRAWS: 4 DRAWS, two of which depends on luck because they were made with Toy Vendor  I could make this combo even better if I had access to <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> because one thing I noticed when doing <strong>Test Hands of Fluffal</strong> was that <strong>you only reach the apex of Fluffal's deck when you manage to solve Toy Vendor at least twice and Reborn from GY's Penguin with Cross-Sheep or Frightfur Repair to extend plays</strong> by Special Summoning Fluffal Monsters from the hand you added with Toy Vendor or being <strong>extremely lucky to draw the right cards</strong> at the right time, which rarely happens.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Discussion about these two Combos:</strong> From these combos it can be seen that in both I had to play (<strong>Dog + Edge Imp Chain</strong>) and what changed was the choice of <strong>what to add to the hand</strong> with <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a>: between choosing to add <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> or choosing <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a>. I've come to the conclusion that making the <strong>Edge Imp Chain eff trigger move with Fluffal Bear</strong> set <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to discard it will be the best option in most situations because <strong>triggering Toy Vendor multiple times</strong> in the same turn <strong>guarantees you to build solid plays and that rely less on luck as you add the Fluffal Monster you need at that gamestate with Toy Vendor</strong>. For example you can make <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> by destroying the Toy Vendor and adding <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> and <strong>if you have an Extender</strong> you bring the Dolphin to the field and set the Toy Vendor by sending <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> to the GY and generate even more advantage. So most of the time <strong>Fluffal's problem to continue playing is just putting the Toy Vendor Search on the field because when you manage to do that you reach the apex of the deck</strong>.  Playing with <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> is only worthwhile when you <strong>already have</strong> <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> in hand because you will make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> very early in the combo using <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> material and then Fusion Summon using Penguin as material that will be <strong>Reborn of the GY with Cross-Sheep allowing you to Extend moves</strong>. But even so, you are faced with the dilemma of <strong>having to draw a Dolphin or something similar to continue</strong> after Fusion Summon so in practice comboing through <strong>Toy Vendor is always better for taking the randomness of miraculous Draws to continue playing since you have several one-offs in the deck that just want to add to the hand at the right time</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// That said, if the problem is that you can extend the plays after the Toy Vendor Search and put the monster on the table by Special Summoning from the hand, then how to increase the chance of making your combo work? Basically you have <strong>three ways via the Fluffal engine</strong> to Special Summon your hand monsters: <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>, <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a>.  Thinking only of turn 1 deck plays, the only ways to resolve the extender <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> would be: - you use the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> combo to Add Repair for the hand and the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> sends a Fusion to the GY - <strong>hard draw</strong> her and you have a lot of Draw effects for that and then send a Fusion to GY - or <strong>send it straight from the deck to the GY</strong> with <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> <strong>or discard it</strong> to resolve cards like Toy Vendor and Penguin.  The <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> is a Extender of Special Summon from Hand that by itself <strong>depends on luck to resolve</strong> because you need to <strong>DRAW a Fluffal Monster</strong> to be able to Special Summon it. However, there is a way via the engine to make this effect always resolve: use <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> eff to <strong>return a Fluffal Monster to the top of the deck</strong>.  And <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> will be an Extender <strong>whenever you summon a different copy of it to the field</strong>, so it's the easiest of the three to resolve in theory. The problem is you can bring him to the field because the easiest way would be for you to Fusion Summon using Penguin as material and use <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> to Reborn Penguin. However, the Fluffal engine in the pure version <strong>cannot Cross-Sheep before Fusion Summon most of the time</strong> because you only start the turn by putting two monsters on the field as follows: - Use <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> eff to return a Fluffal monster like Fluffal Dog to the hand and bring an ""Edge Imp"" monster instead - <strong>Be lucky</strong> enough to use the Toy Vendor effect and hit a Fluffal Monster to Special Summon ANY monster in your hand. So you're faced with having <strong>to do Cross-Sheep only towards the end of the Combo</strong> when you've already done Fusion Summon and <strong>to trigger your Reborn effect you have to use</strong> <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> eff on the GY as I showed in Combo 2 and that's <strong>not it's very efficient</strong> because again we get into the story of you needing to get out of inertia to use this effect but the opponent's interactions will stop you most of the time.  Anyway, using <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> as an Extender depends on what your play is going on, so there's <strong>no guarantee you'll always access it</strong>, especially since it's a one-off card. As for <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>, you <strong>maximize the number of copies in the deck</strong> to make sure you can use them during your combos. After all this fuss comes the point I want to make about <strong>how to increase the consistency of the deck</strong> to use your main extenders (<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>) in the best possible way:  - We have to use <strong>Extenders from outside the archetype</strong> which are the examples of Main Deck and Side Deck cards that I put just to discuss this subject:  - <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> that has excellent <strong>synergy with</strong> <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and is still a body on the field to make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> <strong>as soon as possible</strong> making it the <strong>second best generic Enabler card option</strong> for the Fluffal deck.  - In the Side Deck I put more examples of <strong>cards that function as a body on the field</strong> to make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a>: <strong>Hand Traps</strong> that not only interact with the opponent but also stay on the field like <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> and <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>.  But the suspense I leave is to present the <strong>best generic Enabler card option for the Fluffal deck</strong>: <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> and <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> package. This engine <strong>does the same role as the Golden Lord</strong> of interacting with Toy Vendor and Cross-Sheep only in a much better way: - You now have a <strong>second way to stack the top of the deck with a Fluffal monster</strong> to take the <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> eff randomness out of Draw ensuring <strong>you will Special Summon it</strong>. - Second that you <strong>pay the discard of the activation of the Toy Vendor's Draw effect with the Illusion of Chaos</strong> itself that you didn't return to the top of the deck. - Thirdly, <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> will enter the field to be <strong>half of the</strong> <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> apart from not being able to do it early in the combo. - Room that like the Golden Lord you <strong>send the Toy Vendor to the GY to buy cards at the same time you get a Search</strong>. - Fifth it is Dark attribute so it's half a <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> to make <strong>moves to force interactions</strong> like stealing the <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> from the opponent's GY. In short, using 2 <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> + 3 <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> is mandatory in any <strong>competitive Fluffal build currently</strong>, I'm just not using it because this is a version I tested before I understood the importance of the Souls package in the deck. So you've just discovered the <strong>best deck in the game to abuse the Illusion of Chaos package</strong>.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Test Hands</strong>: These are some replays I did about my progression in learning how to use Fluffal in the best way possible. At that time I still used <a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a> in the deck so that's why I left it in the Side Deck to comment on this fact, I also used 3 <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> but I saw that these two cards weren't that good in the deck because you don't Fusion Summon that much to win games. These test hands are <strong>not didactic, so many times I had to go back a move because it wasn't the best option</strong>. And there are times that in the random draws of cards like <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> I added from the deck to the hand instead of buying because I already knew the draws that would be because this is an <strong>improved version of the test hand compared to the original I had made</strong> with the same Opening Hand and that I had realized that I made a move wrong and this is the final version of the best way to make each combo. One thing that is clear in these replays is that they take away any doubts anyone might have about wanting to <strong>play Fluffal Blind Second because they think turn 1 of the deck is weak when in fact you can always setup at least 3 interactions</strong>, including <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> + <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and Bahamut Shark bringing <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and also the interaction of <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>. I'm not one to make <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> turn 1, I prefer the <strong>versatility of I:P Masquerena</strong> that can either become an Apollousa on the opponent's turn or a <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>. I only do Apollousa on turn 1 in combos where I've Special Summoned so much that <strong>I need to clear my field to have room for other plays</strong> and that's exactly Apollousa's role in most decks in the game: turning multiple <strong>monsters that are doing nothing on the field in an omni negate</strong> making room for you to do more atrocities.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38832002 TEST HAND 1 Penguins Garden + (Edge Imp Chain + Dog) + Octopus = Cross-Sheep + I:P Masquerena + Penguin /in Hand: Edge Imp Scythe But I could have done it differently: 1 - Use Penguins Garden to discard Edge Imp Chain 2 - Give NS from Fluffal Penguin and SS Dog to Add Dolphin (but this move really needs Sheep to work so this turns out to be the best way to play) *3 - <strong>Replay error</strong>: I had already used the Dog effect so I had to bring the Octopus straight and I had to fix this move.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38832768 TEST HAND 2 Dog + Wings + Dolphin + Polymerization + Patchwork I hit Toy Vendor allowing SS to Dolphin and DRAW Penguin + Scythe and Add Octopus Dolphin send Edge Imp Sabers Set Toy Vendor and Activate Patchwork Add Edge Imp Chain  Cruel Whael Fusion move and first use Frightfur Repair effect for Reborn Penguin and Bahamut Shark + Toad and then Cross-Sheep Edge Imp Sabers play + Toy Vendor and Cross-Sheep Reborn Penguin / Toy Vendor discard Scythe and SS Octopus and Add Scythe to Hand I:P Masquerena + Abyss Dweller  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38833408 TEST HAND 3 Toy Vendor + Patchwork + Edge Imp Sabers + 2 Penguins ***Fusion Frightfur Tiger to destroy your own Toy Vendor to make Dolphin send Wings Combo. LUCK: Buy Sheep = allows you to reach Cross-Sheep for you to then play Edge Imp Sabers + Toy Vendor Reborn GY's Penguin with Cross-Sheep and brought Dolphin to the hand and make Bahamut Shark and then made Toy Vendor buy Penguin to have the missing Octopus summon extender to add Edge Imp Scythe back to the hand.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38833944 TEST HAND 4 (Dog + Edge Imp Chain) + Scythe + Wings + Repair LUCK: I hit the Toy Vendor DRAW Penguin and was able to Special Summon Edge Imp Chain and make LINK-2 Cross-Sheep and add Patchwork Big Brain: Making Tiger Destroys Patchwork and Reborn Penguin and Search Dolphin Do Dolphin eff send Octopus because it had Repair in Hand and Bahamut Shark + Toad and Reborn Octopus Add Scythe to Hand Wings Combo = Toy Vendor Add Sheep = Lambda  END BOARD: Cross-Sheep + I:P Masquerena + Lambda + Toad /in Hand: Octopus + Scythe + Penguin /in GY: Repair + Edge Imp Sabers  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38834453 TEST HAND 5 (Toy Vendor + (Bear + Edge Imp Chain) + Penguin + Scythe) Make play Tiger and destroy Toy Vendor at the same time DRAW 2 Discard 1 Toy Vendor Add Dolphin and Dolphin combo with Wings and Add Sheep = Cross-Sheep while returning Dolphin to the hand Edge Imp Sabers eff Reborn from GY and Cross-Sheep eff Reborn Penguin and Penguin eff to make Bahamut Shark + Toad  END BOARD: Cross-Sheep + I:P Masquerena + Tiger + Toad /in Hand: Edge Imp Scythe + Toy Vendor  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38834899 TEST HAND 6 Gamma + Dog + (Penguin + Patchwork) + Polymerization Add Scythe to guarantee Fusion Summon play on the opponent's turn and gave Redundant Draws with Penguin I did Normal Summon Dog and Add Octopus to Special and Add Scythe to Hand.  END Board: Lambda + Octopus /in Hand: Scythe and Follow Ups.  <strong>If I had negated a Hand Trap with Gamma</strong>: Cross-Sheep and changed it to (Tiger move destroys Toy Vendor) Dog = Bear = Toy Vendor and destroy to add Dolphin and Penguin comes back from GY with Cross-Sheep to bring Dolphin from hand and you do Full Combo.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38835398 TEST HAND 7 Gamma + (Penguin Garden + Owl) + Scythe + Repair LUCK: Penguin DRAWS = Wings + Toy Vendor LINK-2 Lambda and Repair eff Reborn Penguin and plays Fluffal Wings and Toy Vendor LUCK: DRAW Foolish Burial Goods and Search Dolphin Dolphin Send Played Edge Imp Sabers and Bahamut Shark + Toad Foolish Burial Goods = Octopus and Edge Imp Sabers return Octopus and Toy Vendor DRAW and Special it to Add Edge Imp Scythe back to Hand  End Board: Lambda + Toad + I:P Masquerena + Octopus + Toy Vendor /in Hand: Scythe + Gamma /in GY: Penguin + Edge Imp Sabers + Repair  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38848897 TEST HAND 8 Toy Vendor + (Bear + Edge Imp Chain + Penguis Garden) + Driver I used Dolphin as a fusion material because I wanted to return one of the Polymerizations to the deck and have a valid target to activate Patchwork on the next turn. Whenever you use Edge Imp Scythe as a Fusion material, it's because you've already thought about adding it back to the hand with Fluffal Octopus whose main function is exactly to leave Scythe + Penguin's play alive on the opponent's turn. I made a <strong>mistake</strong> in order to bring Dog into the field as I needed to bring Octopus as a priority.  END Board: Apollousa(24ATK) + I:P Masquerena + Toad + Edge Imp Chain /in Hand: Scythe /in GY: Sabers + Dolphin + Penguin + Repair + Toy Vendor  ///////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Final explanation about some Cards:</strong>  Always summon the <strong>Fusion Monster in Middle Zone</strong> because that zone <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> <strong>will ever points to</strong>. Speaking of monster zones always summon <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> or <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> in the Extra Monster Zones Column to avoid conflict with Cross-Sheep.  /////////////////////<strong>Main Deck Cards:</strong>  <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Fluffal Octopus</a> will grant you the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> back to the hand if you <strong>had to discard it for the GY or use it as Fusion Material</strong> and even Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> to the hand and Special and return the Octopus to the hand to bring an ""Edge Imp"" monster from the GY. And if you bring him in on your opponent's turn with <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> you continue to <strong>add GY Monsters to your hand for free</strong>. An interesting thing about the effect when used as a Fusion Material is that you in addition to <strong>returning</strong> <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> (used as <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> material) to the GY you can also return any other Banished Monster like <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a> to the GY and the Gamma will come alive again.  <a data-name=""Royal Penguins Garden"">Royal Penguins Garden</a> Continuous Spell allows you to do 2 card Full Combo because it adds <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> on activation and <strong>can decrease Penguin Level to discard a card</strong> and we have great discards like <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>. For example with Edge Imp Chain Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> and Add Polymerization and Scythe/Sabres. The same goes for Toy Vendor that you discard and Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> to make a move to set it back and send <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> to the GY. The only downside is not being able to do <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> because it becomes Level 3 but even that is easy to get around by doing Fusion Summon it goes back to Level 4 and just <strong>Reborn with Cross-Sheep for example to make Bahamut + Toad</strong>. Being a Spell in the s/t Zone you take advantage of cards like <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> and <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> by sending it to the GY for free.  <a data-name=""Phantazmay"">Phantazmay</a> is a good card in the deck because drawing two cards will allow you to leave <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> alive on your opponent's turn to make <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> and basically you get two Monsters on the field with one protecting your cards from being targeted.  /////////////////////<strong>Deck interactions with Artifact Scythe for anyone who wants to use it:</strong> Another interesting interaction of <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Fluffal Octopus</a> is with <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> taking <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> and you make Cruel Whale using it as material then you return Scythe to GY and destroy <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a> with Cruel Whale for even after Cosmic Cyclone manages to lock it Extra Deck. <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> even if you hard draw him you can fearlessly discard to GY because you can just pass with <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a> and on the opponent's turn Edge Imp Scythe summon <strong>Cruel Whale to pop Dagda and trigger eff to Reborn Artifact Scythe</strong> and lock opponent's from use Extra Deck anyways.  /////////////////////<strong>Extra Deck Cards:</strong>  One thing some people don't know about <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> is that you don't have to specifically Summon an Extra Deck Monster type and have to trigger eff because any monster that you Special Summon in a zone it points to <strong>already triggers its effect if you have a Fusion Monster in the other Zone it points</strong> to you will Reborn a Level 4 or lower GY Monster in the same way.  <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> has <strong>secret 500ATK Boost effect</strong> that no one remembers when using a <strong>WATER monster</strong> as Xyz Material so your fusions like <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> and <a data-name=""kraken"">kraken</a> become even stronger with Abyss Dweller on the field.  One Extra Deck card that I'm definitely thinking about taking out to play a competitive version of Fluffal is <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> because I've never had to so it's <strong>just taking the place of a more useful card</strong>. I would instead use cards like <a data-name=""Dragostapelia"">Dragostapelia</a> for Super Polymerization, or <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> which is giant at times when you need to buy time in the game, test <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> in place or put a LINK-4 ending games like Accesscode Talker.  /////////////////////<strong>Explanation some Side Deck cards:</strong>  I'm not using <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> because it's pretty clear that this card will be banned and this deck doesn't have the absurd fusion spell of strong and boss monsters at the level of <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> and <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. Speaking of DPE, using it in this deck doesn't make any sense because you're just trying to do what a lot of competitive decks do only worse.  The best target to use <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> in the deck would be to use <a data-name=""Dragostapelia"">Dragostapelia</a> given the popularity of Fusion monsters in the format and you don't have much room in the extra deck to put more than one Super Poly target.  <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> is an insane card for Fusion decks and in this deck you even get protection while you have Polymerization in the GY and you use generic materials to make it so we can use cards like Eldlich the Golden Lord and Psy-Framegear Gamma as Fusion Material.  ////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, these are just examples of cards I've used to discuss their use in the deck.  &nbsp;"

This version of the <em>Exodia</em> <em>deck</em> focuses on blocking the opponent attacks and drawing lots of cards until you get the 5 pieces in your hand.  Almost all monsters are to be set in face-down DEF position, exception made for the Cyber Valley which has to be summoned in ATK position (and the 5 pieces of Exodia, of course). Lots of spells and traps focus on preventing or defending from attacks, while the rest are for drawing and searching the 5 pieces. The deck must be exactly 40 cards in order not to lower the probability to draw the 5 pieces.  A couple of simple <strong>combos</strong>: - <a data-name=""Reckless Greed"">Reckless Greed</a> must not be used until you can activate 2 or 3 simultaneously (to skip only 2 draw phases, but drawing 4 or 6 cards) or, alternatively, in desperate situations. - <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a> works really well with <a data-name=""Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"">Scrap-Iron Scarecrow</a> and <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a>, but of course it's quite easy for the opponent to get rid of this combo since it's sufficient to remove a continuos spell which is easy. This combo will probably let us gain a few turns.  <strong>Side Deck</strong> analysis: - <a data-name=""Crystal Seer"">Crystal Seer</a> is the most valid monster we kept outside the deck, so it might be added if necessary cycle through the deck faster - A 3rd <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a> if the first two are not enough, but it's also very likely that instead we could reduce from 2 to 1 in the main deck (needs testing) - <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> is the most valid spell we kept outside the deck, so it might be added if necessary to defend more - <a data-name=""Burial From a Different Dimension"">Burial From a Different Dimension</a> is a desperate partial remedy in case the opponent manages to banish some pieces - <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> is a desperate partial remedy in case the opponent manages to make us discard some pieces - <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> could very likely be moved directly in the Main Deck, but depends on how frequently the opponents use board wipes, is a very valid trap - <a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a> is analogous to the <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> - <a data-name=""Royal Oppression"">Royal Oppression</a> has to be used with opponents making a lot of special summonings - <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a> is for stopping decks with combos relying on specific monsters  A <strong>variant of this deck</strong> is possible as follows: <em>Remove</em>: - 3x <a data-name=""Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"">Scrap-Iron Scarecrow</a> - 3x <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a> - 2x <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a> <em>Add</em>: - 3x <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> - 3x <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a> (or alternative cards as 1 <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a> and/or 1 <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> and 1/2 good card(s) from the suggested list) - 2x <a data-name=""Crystal Seer"">Crystal Seer</a> It substitutes a defending combo with a single slightly stronger defensive card and puts more effort into drawing cards.  A few <strong>extra useful cards</strong>: <em>Monsters</em>: - <a data-name=""Vortex Trooper"">Vortex Trooper</a> (another valid monster to draw some cards, but has some drawbacks) - <a data-name=""Deep Diver"">Deep Diver</a> (theoretically good, but too slow since you need to wait the end of the battle phase and the card goes on top, therefore ""blocks"" the next draw phase) - <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> (not awesome since only prevents direct attacks, but still ends the battle phase) - <a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a> (could work well with <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a>, but the <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a> si simply better)  <em>Spells</em>: - <a data-name=""Giant Trunade"">Giant Trunade</a> (could turn out to be useful in case lots of opponents use many offensive spells and traps, but we do not attack so having them to set defences is going to block them and we don't want to help remove them) - <a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a> (probably even worst than <a data-name=""Giant Trunade"">Giant Trunade</a> since it also destroys our own spells and traps) - <a data-name=""Card Trader"">Card Trader</a> (apparently good, but actually quite slow) - <a data-name=""Nightmare's Steelcage"">Nightmare's Steelcage</a> (probably too much since we have Swords of Revealing Light, but still a very valid option) - <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a> (one of the best alternative to <a data-name=""Reload"">Reload</a>, <a data-name=""Card Trader"">Card Trader</a>, <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> since you can choose which cards to recycle, but still it's a -1 in hand)  <em>Traps</em>: - <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a> (could easily add a x3 of this one to reinforce the <a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu"">Legacy of Yata-Garasu</a>, simply there were more important cards to add as defences) - <a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a> (good to gain 1 turn, prevents all possible attacks risks) - <a data-name=""Threatening Roar"">Threatening Roar</a> (alternative to <a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>, prevent all possible attacks) - <a data-name=""Defense Draw"">Defense Draw</a> (not perfect, only saves you from 1 attack, doesn't protect the monster, but lets you draw 1 card) - <a data-name=""Magic Cylinder"">Magic Cylinder</a> (strong, but we don't care about damaging the opponent) - <a data-name=""Dimensional Prison"">Dimensional Prison</a> (only stops 1 attack) - <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> (maybe)  <em>Please leave some comments to let me know what your think and keep playing this wonderful format!</em>"

(if you want the deskbot line, i suggest to remove 1 monk and 1 shaman of tenyi to add halqi and auroradon)  the gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je8Q7VkUwGc  Warning: might be very boring, no DPE, no halqi combo.  Basic Combo:  1 Card: Swordsoul Emergence search for taia, banish taia, search for swordsoul emergence (if you drew wyrm next turn, you can search mo ye, if you did not search for taia) or swordsoul blackout (for extra disturption).  2 Cards: Swordsoul Mo Ye +1 wyrm bread and butter of swordsoul combo, mo ye would synchro lv 8 chixiao to search for Longyuan and synchro 10 (either baroness or chengying, if you have card effect that banish or destroy your chengying except chixiao such as called by the grave or swordsoul blackout) chengying could be solid option.  2 Tenyi (Ashuna +1 different name Tenyi) Special summon ashuna, link summon monk tenyi, use the second tenyi to SS itself, use ashuna effect to SS the different name from field tenyi (i.e. SS vishuda if you have adhara) synchro to chixiao. Now, you have two route depending on your hand and matchup, against light based opponent, you don't want to banish adhara since you want to use baxia eff to destroy monk of the tenyi and SS adhara. route 1: banish Adhara to add Ashuna from banish, chixiao would search for Mo Ye or Longyuan, Mo Ye will reveal ashuna to synchro lv 8 (baxia or drago berserker of tenyi) or longyuan would discard ashuna to become chengying. route 2: Chixiao search for Taia (no wyrm or swordsoul) or Mo Ye (have another wyrm / swordsoul card), synchro lv 8 baxia then destroy monk of the tenyi to SS adhara from GY, synchro 9 chaofeng lock light  4 card: the combo is pretty similar with 2 card Mo Ye, but you start with Longyuan first to synchro baronne to avoid nibiru, then you will synchro Baronne, then lv 8 chixiao, alternatively you can do this with taia for three hand combo."
