If u, sadly, go second, hope to draw lightning storm or you will probably lose.  The strategy is really easy, set-up your backrow, interrupt opponents plays and hit hard with ""Lord of heavenly prison"" and the Parshath monster that you summon with ""Rebirth of Parshath"".  If you expect the opponent to destroy your backrow, set ""Waking the dragons"" to summon what do you want from the Extra Deck.  For longer games you have ""Reedemable jar"" to recycle your counter trap.  The deck is not competitive and only for fun.  In the side deck I put some cards that can be useful or that can change the strategy a bit."

From the high level insects we have 4 options and the <a data-name=""Gadarla"">Gadarla</a> is not necessarily part of the priority targets of the Resonance Insect as it does not generate any type of combo but an interruption to be accessed when necessary.  The number of Normal Summons and Extender should be high because you need to have a two-card combination to make any combo as you need to access the extra deck's Links for your engine to spin out of inertia and how costly this task is once you is Link-2 or higher you need that amount of cards for the deck to work. As these Link-2 <a data-name=""Picofalena"">Picofalena</a> and <a data-name=""Armor Horn"">Armor Horn</a> are very sensitive to interactions, you often depend on your Starters to be able to bypass any hand traps or other interactions on these cards and that's why <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a>, <a data-name=""Resonance Insect"">Resonance Insect</a> and <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole </a>are key pieces in the deck's operation as they are very versatile and can be a interrupt against annoying monsters like Winda in the case of Sting the Poison or adding <a data-name=""Sting Lancer"">Sting Lancer</a> and Gadarla in the case of Resonance Insect or Vanilla for the hand with Gokipole and that way you build your field while handles opponent's interactions. Because of that we have to use <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a> and <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> in the deck to have access to these cards as soon as possible mostly sending Gokipole to the GY which becomes a Resonance Insect search for the hand or a Vanilla interrupt, but it also happens that sometimes you don't have extenders on hand to access the extra deck's Links and that way you add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> for the hand that becomes two bodies on the field.  Well, why did I just talk about Starters and mention Gokipole a lot (which isn't even a Normal Summon right and yes you want to send it to the gy somehow) but not <a data-name=""Scout Buggy"">Scout Buggy</a>? Because the Scout Buggy by itself doesn't help you deal with interactions because it's just a ""Tour Guide"" for itself but in the pure version of the deck it's a good starter and also the only efficient way to make <a data-name=""Cicada King"">Cicada King</a> besides mainly being an excellent follow up for the existence of Field Spell <a data-name=""Beetrooper Formation"">Beetrooper Formation</a> having a lot of use every turn in GY which improves the grind game that is the objective of this deck: take the opponent to the grind game and have a more advantageous exchange of resources. Other reasons why it is excellent in the pure version is because it is the second best option for a deck special with <a data-name=""Invincible Atlas"">Invincible Atlas</a> and that happens a lot.  About Sting Lancer, Scale Bomber and Beetrooper Spells/Traps used in the main deck: There was a time when I really liked using 3 <a data-name=""Sting Lancer"">Sting Lancer</a> (because it's the best Beetrooper card in the game so far) but first I noticed that you never want to draw 2 copies in the starting hand becoming a brick, second in this format the number of hand traps that activate being discarded to gy decreased so it's very difficult for his effect to stay alive on turn 1, third that even with the high amount of cards good to return to the deck in this format thanks to <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> and his friend <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> the Sting Lancer is so easily accessible and recyclable that really 2 copies is the ideal number.  About <a data-name=""Scale Bomber"">Scale Bomber</a> I rarely take advantage of his interaction effect on the field but I keep maximizing it to 3 as he can chain block his Normal Summon but it sure is a card that can be reduced to 2 copies post side just like I do with Battlewasp's special summon extenders. About me not using <a data-name=""Assault Roller"">Assault Roller</a> I say that I never found the card good compared to Vanilla, although it can be an extender even if you have it in your hand the fact is that this deck has few ways to interact with the established field of opponent and Vanilla is one of the few options that the deck has access to destroy the opponent's cards and that's why I consider it a card 10 times better than the Assault Roller besides not needing to ban gy resources to enter the field. In short it is an extender and brick in the same way as Assault Roller but its cost-effectiveness is much better and rewarding, it is so necessary that whenever it is possible to return it to the deck you return it to make <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> an interaction/extender.  Why not use the <a data-name=""Heavy Beetrooper Mighty Neptune"">Heavy Beetrooper Mighty Neptune</a>? When the Spoiler from Beetrooper's supports were all known I saw him as the best among them all because he fixes the problem of banishing several Insects and not having to recycle them back to the deck but in practice it turned out to be a very bad card that brick every starting hand you see her and even in long grind game matches where you get 10 Banned Bugs I didn't miss him in the deck at all. So I currently consider it an unnecessary brick. In the future if the deck gets new support it may improve.  The spell <a data-name=""Beetrooper Descent"">Beetrooper Descent</a> has many advantages to be used but at the same time many disadvantages: The first advantage is that it is very beneficial to have 3 targets for the <a data-name=""Sting Lancer"">Sting Lancer</a> to add to the hand throughout the game and this is very relevant. Second it makes the Sting Lancer two bodies on the field which is important when you are playing after suffering interruptions from the opponent. Third it is a spell/trap out when you have the <a data-name=""Invincible Atlas"">Invincible Atlas</a> on the field. But it brings many disadvantages that make the difference that is the case to create a token which does not become an Insect in GY to banish with <a data-name=""Armor Horn"">Armor Horn</a> and <a data-name=""Doom Dozer"">Doom Dozer</a> and this lack of resources makes you not able to continue playing or need to do so unoptimized plays and banish Bugs that shouldn't be banned, second that the destroy spell/trap effect doesn't prove as excellent against trap decks as it seems: often your opponent knows you added it with the Sting Lancer and throws around it activate <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> in Standby Phase to banish the Invincible Atlas and that way you can no longer destroy backrow and the worst thing is that it needs to first create the token and then destroy cards so it simply won't work on the <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> effect which is the worst Floodgate against the deck being a card that leaves a lot to be desired against trap match. To be honest cards like <a data-name=""Resonance Insect"">Resonance Insect</a>, <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> are much more important to win matches against Anti-meta and backrow decks because they have excellent floating effects if they let the field and trap deck destroy the opponent's monsters at all times to control the field.  About Extra Deck I have to comment that the existence of <a data-name=""Almiraj"">Almiraj</a> is one of the reasons why I don't maximize <a data-name=""Retaliating &quot;C&quot;"">Retaliating ""C""</a> because it simply cannot become an Almiraj and also because the search targets are the worst compared to the versatility of the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and the <a data-name=""Resonance Insect"">Resonance Insect</a>. Almiraj is also very important to play around cards like <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> besides being the way the deck can access <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> under the <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> effect since it is Cyberse and you can then summon from an Insect and make phoenix to pop the TCBO and keep playing after that so it's an essential card in this deck and its gy effect isn't hard to use either because like your Normal Summon bugs most trigger effects when destroyed by battle too so it's not It's unusual for you to go into the battle phase and destroy your own monsters like the Resonance Insect, Gokipole and Arbalest the Rapidfire that activate excellent floating effects.  <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect"">Shinobi Insect</a> is a card that should only be used because it is relevant that it is a Link-2 Insect made using two monsters with different names and also it is a free insect to be banned in the GY in place of other important insects, besides being a of the cards that help you play about the effect of <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> until you manage to destroy it. <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> is the extra deck flexible spot and I've already tested using the second <a data-name=""Seraphim Papillion"">Seraphim Papillion</a>, <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a> and <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> but in this format I've been facing a lot of decks that use <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> and I see Wind Pegasus as an excellent card to use against these strategies to make Winda with Schism. It's also not hard to make because of <a data-name=""Primitive Butterfly"">Primitive Butterfly</a> + <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> becoming an out for <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> so it has its uses in the deck. As I don't particularly do an aggressive endboard playing with this deck as most players go through with Counter Trap and Seraphim Papillion to reborn Sting the Poison on the opponent's turn I don't miss the second Seraphim Papillion but I confess it is very annoying having to shuffle him back to the extra deck every turn and the fear of seeing him banned from the gy by the opponent and not having access to him for the rest of the game but this risk I've been punished practically never until now and that's why I decide to keep keeping a versatility card like Wind Pegasus.  About the Side deck I usually don't make big changes from the main deck to the side deck because it's no use filling the deck with tech cards and not having plays after stopping the opponent so I think the side deck is balanced for the problems that the deck faces. <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> is essential when you go first with this deck because postside the opponent will have a lot of hate backrow like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> because you know you don't go through with monster interactions on the field, your interactions are all spell/trap zone and in your hand you will then receive a lot of side cards that Solemn Judgment denies.  On the DPE version that ranked second on the Remote Duel YCS Europe: This version of the deck focused on DPE Turbo makes sense because you trade the bad stuff in the deck, which is the scarcity of extra-deck monsters, to the Insect type. it makes it torture to play with the deck lock on Insects because you have nowhere to go and the win condition is very weak. So instead of lock-in on Insects why not choose to end up with a real win condition called <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>? That's the result. Not to mention that in this version you remove all the engine cards that don't help your deck play because one of the worst things about Beetrooper is the fact that you use a lot of one-offs that you never want to see in your hand because they are searchable and they are just part of your end board, they don't help the deck's resilience and that makes a difference in the deck's performance throughout a tournament. This deck's Bricks are very painful to buy but necessary to have a respectable grind game but the win condition is so weak that you don't even make the grind game most of the time, so this approach of focusing on passing with Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer and cutting out all the bad vibes the deck uses makes perfect sense. The deck has Link Climb power, the engine is good but it is the DPE together with <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> that makes the deck viable and for sure this is a deck that has its days numbered because it is impossible to imagine that in the next banlist Verte Anaconda will continue in the game because it is the biggest problem of this format, the number of games I forgive is countless because of the existence of Verte Anaconda in the game. I don't think it's wrong that there are power spells that fuse the deck, I'm not mad at the guy activating Fusion Destiny but for sure he has the option to use Anaconda for that is unjustifiable. You have to choose to hold the best interaction of your deck like Counter Trap <a data-name=""Beetrooper Fly&amp;Sting"">Beetrooper Fly&amp;Sting</a> for Anaconda instead of the opponent's engine cards and this creates something very toxic in the game where the opponent is forcing your interactions just to be guaranteed be able to solve Verte Anaconda because it wins games for you and that has to end. That's why I think the pure version of Beetrooper will improve a lot with the banning of Verte Anaconda because the game is fairer where you can give interactions in the opponent's deck engine and not have to play around Verte Anaconda. The DPE version only exists because of this broken Link-2 that should have been banned a long time ago.

Heroes aren't the poster boys of fusion no more.,"Predaplants is a very hardcore fusion deck. They fuse as extenders and fuse as final board presence. You can go all fusion only and have the albaz fusion on but you can also do a mix of links, synchro and fusions. There are even options to side in more cards if you want.  When searching predaplant cards, search predapruning if you can first, then some of the effect monsters, and use the pendulum link to search the scale you are missing. I tend to have 5 searches each time.  Not fusion locked tips: Odd-eyes synchron is easy enough to use to make baronne after you fuse the scales to make a random fusion and get the scale 8 back in hand. I also like to have a preda counter on the link monster since it alters levels unless you want that and that way you can summon back the level one from grave.  Fusion locked tips: Cards that locks you under fusion; branded fusion and predapractice. Always send the level one predaplant with the branded fusion. Then of course there is the preda counter strategy that is pure fusion strategy really. There are 5 fusion cards and lots of ways to get materials.  My favorite searchable way to place counters is the trap predaplanning that can foolish the level one on your opponents turn for a search. I want to use necro fusion more but I do tend to have all my cards on board before needing it."

Aluber costs a lot, but if you are thinking of buying this deck he is essential to it, as he is like a Stratos. The main combo is Branded Fusion into Lubellion using Tragedy and Albaz, Albaz searches Branded in Red, then summoning Mirrorjade by Lubellion's effect. Using the Anaconda strat kinda works in the deck, but I have never really used it when I did use the deck. I added deployment just in case, but you can replace it with some handtraps, the same with lightning storm as that card is really expensive. The main weakness is negates and background removal, which is why I added Twin Twisters and Lightning Storm. But overall I've seen success with this deck."

The Deck uses Machine monsters primarily and Dragon monsters secondari","A <b>Cyberdark Deck</b> focuses on the use of machine cards, with dragon cards supporting. Making a proper build of this deck type requires good spell and trap cards that help fill up the graveyard quickly, so you can take advantage of discard cards like Tribute to the Doomed and Monster Reincarnation. Future Fusion and Foolish Burial are also effective for getting level 3 or lower dragons in the graveyard. Fusion monsters are used as auxiliary backup, being formed from, Cyberdark Impact!, Overload Fusion, and Dragon's Mirror they require that there be proper material monsters in the grave, making the use of them late game only, unless used in conjunction with Future Fusion. Virus cards can be used for addition advantage because Cyberdark monsters span the spectrum of their requirements. Synchro support comes in the form of level 7 and 6 monsters specifically Goyo Guardian, Dark Strike Fighter and Black Rose Dragon  Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Edge, and Cyberdark Keel in addition to having equipping effects each have a unique addition damage ability that punishes defensive play by an opponent. Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Edge, and Cyberdark Keel deliver piercing, direct, and burn damage respectively.  Cyberdarks are by themselves very weak monsters, with only 800 attack points, even a skilled duelist will get nervous using a deck like this, it has a lot of weaknesses, being near completely aggressive, relying on the grave to gain momentum, and weak against anti-monster spell/trap cards. Another looming threat is that the opponent turn this deck's graveyard against the duelist, like by using Monster Reborn on a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. A threat like this can be remedied by using dragons that are difficult to special summon like Yamata Dragon and Tyrant Dragon, or even dragons that cannot be special summoned from the graveyard like Diabolos, King of the Abyss, Light and Darkness Dragon, Armed Dragon LV10, Armed Dragon LV7, Dark Armed Dragon, Rainbow Dragon, or Rainbow Dark Dragon.  Ultimately, the high level dragon monsters used for Cyberdark Dragon in this deck comes down to the duelist's taste. If he or she wants to play it safe, then the aforementioned dragons can be used. If the duelist enjoys the Red-Eyes Black Dragon or Blue-Eyes White Dragon cards, they splash in very well. If the duelist wants to use a lot of Synchro Monster, then this deck can be easily geared towards powerful Synchro Dragons as well. Factors in deciding this depend on whether the deck is Dragon or Machine focused, and Fusion or Synchro focused.  The effects of the Cyberdarks only activate when they are Normal Summoned and cards such as Compulsory Evacuation Device, Pulling the Rug and Solemn Judgment will negate them. If a Cyberdark is in the graveyard, use Monster Reincarnation to discard a low level dragon and get the Cyberdark back in your hand and then re-summon it again and equip it with the dragon that was just discarded. Dark Eruption is a very good card for this deck too.  A nice little trick is to use Dark Armed Dragon or Light and Darkness Dragon to be equiped to Cyberdark Dragon. Both have 2800 attack which brings Cyberdark Dragon to 3800 not including the monsters in the grave. With Light and Darkness Dragon, when he's destroyed while being treated as an equip card, his second effect will still activate, wiping your field and summoning any monster from your grave. This can be useful if you just tributed your dragon for a virus, or if it was killed by a spell or trap such as Mirror Force."

Previous to this, every Fabled deck I have seen has pretty much been geared towards 'summon Cosmic Blazar Dragon and pass', this deck can do a lot more. By 'making Fableds playable' have I stuck in other archetypes and some floodgates? Absolutely! But theres genuine synergy here I swear and anytime cards are old enough not to include a 'once per turn' clause there's room for abusing that. </span>  <span>The goal of the deck is to climb into some of the biggest baddest synchros in the game (Baronne de Fleur has REALLY helped this, and it's great at summoning it) while drawing into some of your power cards (Dogmatikas, Nadir Servant especially) and floodgates (Vanity's Ruler, Imperial Order).</span>  <span>MAIN DECK</span>  <span>Rescue Cat, the Danger!s and the beast-type Fableds all aim to summon themselves as much as possible with an ideal combo of Hyper librarian -&gt; Fabled Ragin -&gt; Stardust Charge Warrior -&gt; Chaos Ruler -&gt; BdF netting you a tidy 7 draws, a 5 deep pseudo-search for a monster of your choosing and an omni-negate to boot. Grimro and Kushano help facilitate plays along with Double Summon, Monster Reborn, and Card Destruction to trigger some of your Fabled beasts effects. While risky given the number of decks that love to dump hand components into the grave it's necessary to kick off an otherwise dead hand and potentially gives you knowledge on how to adjust your end board. Stairway to a Fabled Realm is an in-archetype Foolish Burial with a second effect to discard in exchange for a Fabled in the grave. It's rare but it does sometimes come up. Pot of Avarice and TTT are for draw power. Double summon works wonders when you just can't reach the next stage of a combo and can be used to bring out Vanity's Ruler.</span>  <span>The Dogmatika cards are great going first or second and are super versatile being able to extend combos, add negates and OTK. I often find myself drawing nadir servant somewhere along my combo going first and can just set it until the end of my turn giving me Ecclesia on field and Fleurdelis in hand to add to whatever synchro threats I've been able to establish. Alternatively both Ecclesia and Fleurdelis can be used as synchro combo extenders with a Fleurdelis (or Ashiyan) + either of my lvl 2 Fabled tuners making BdF straight off the bat. I know Ashiyan doesn't feature in every Dogmatika deck but given all the synchro climbing he often gets a chance to summon and can fetch a Fleurdelis or Ecclesia that's fallen foul of a Danger! or Card Destruction.</span>  <span>Imperm is great going first and second and very few decks like to play through Imperial Order. Side deck is still a work in progress but Royal Decree is devastating against the decks that don't care about IO and as a 3 of, this deck can almost garuntee working its way through to a copy .</span>  <span>EXTRA DECK</span>  <span>Titaniklad and Nt'ss are standard Nadir fodder.</span>  <span>Hyper Librarian, Ragin and Stardust Charge Warrior are draw power early combo. Dawn Dragster, Crystal Wing, Archfiend Abyss and BdF are negates to build a board with. Chaos Ruler is truly an MVP of the deck. The 5 deep dig will almost always pick you up the missing Vanity's Ruler, Ecclesia or Fabled you need to extend the combo with. On top of that you can Synchro it away to make Archfiend Abyss or BdF and then bring it back to make the other should you have another tuner.</span>  <span>Gossip Shadow gives you at least some form of protection on the odd time when you don't draw a tuner and enables Dogmatika plays.</span>  <span>Halqifibrax helps with link plays, the Knightmares deal with problematic threats while also enabling a sometimes essential discard and Zeroboros is a boardwipe. With Fleurdelis you can even trigger this on your opponents turn should you fancy it. </span>  <span>SUMMARY</span>  <span>It's not going to take the meta by storm, but the Fabled monsters form the core of what is a surprisingly versatile and adaptive deck that can be a real headache for a lot of other decks to get round. I've not seen anyone else play anything quite like this. Perhaps because it is DIFFICULT and there are some cards that will fundamentally just stop it in its tracks but the result is far more effective than I had hoped for when I started out. Open to any and all feedback and constructive criticism.</span>  &nbsp;"

Tips: -You cannot use Transcode Talkers effect because it locks you into Cyberse monsters for the rest of the turn which means you cannot summon the Levianeer or the catapult turtle.  -The Link Ratings that you banish off of the 2nd effect of Clock Dragon must equal EXACTLY the amount of cards that you have left in deck. If the link ratings are too high you cannot activate the Cyberse Clock Dragon's effect.  -You must search the Clock Wyvern off of Codec when you summon Excode Talker  -You can use Firewall Dragon to return extenders to your hand. Most of the time you want to bounce the Clock Wyvern after using it to extend.  -There is too much to explain so im gonna give up here  &nbsp;

Classic starter for this engine is Creation Venus into triple shine, link spider &amp; imduk off the shines into 4 mat Saryuja.  If you don't open with this &amp; have Diviner of the Heralds in your opener, you can use Diviner to dunk Trias Hierarchia, tribute Diviner for Trias &amp; summon Buten from deck to synchro into Master Flare Hyperion (MFH). From there you give Hyperion Creation Venus' effect &amp; ladder to saryuja.  Extensions (1):  After Saryuja's summoned, you can use its effect to special summon Diviner from hand if you haven't used it already. Use same combo as before to pull MFH. Once you get this synchro out, you can use its effect to get Destruction Venus' effect &amp; pull the shine balls from grave. These can be used to Link into Moon (&amp; leaves 1 for effect cost if you're going 2nd or they summon on your turn), or you can banish Buten from grave &amp; synchro for Jiujiu.  Alternatively, if you don't have Diviner in hand or have already used one &amp; have Jet Synchron in hand, Saryuja can be used to special summon Jet &amp; then used as fodder for Linkross, letting you setup into Martial Metal Marcher (MMM). MMM can be used to pull Jet from grave, and Jet &amp; Linkross can be used for Halq, which can pull a DVenus on summon. This lets you summon Hyper Librarian with your remaining Linkross tokens &amp; pull Jet back to field. (MMM MUST be before Hyper Librarian in this route or else you can't summon Jet with MMM)  Route above can also deviate to Celestial Double Star Shaman (CDSS) instead of Halq, allowing you to pull out 2 shine balls from grave, which can line up for a Hyper Librarian with CDSS/Shine/token, or straight up to a level 8. Going into Borreload Savage nets you a 4 turn omni-negate, while Chaos Ruler grabs a 5 card excavation draw.  If you have a Destruction Venus in hand, you can pull it with Saryuja, pull shine balls from grave, &amp; synchro for Hyper Librarian (if you have other tuners to summon), or straight up to Crocodragon to draw 3 with on its summon &amp; setup QE destruction. DVenus in hand can also perform the same combo as the first part of this section, and leaves some room open for Diviner later on. On CVenus start, this can net you +2 in hand if you summon Crocodragon, with 4 total draw in the combo, 1 of which is a 4 card excavation. Slightly better hand advantage at the end, and keeps Diviner open, but can struggle a bit with extending further.  Avarice can pull back nearly the entire combo to make Saryuja (5/6 cards), so if you have this &amp; another Creation Venus in hand, you can pull the Shine Balls &amp; Link-1's &amp; special summon Creation Venus with Saryuja to start up another draw cycle. If you started with 2 CVenus &amp; Avarice in hand, this line gives you +1 w/ 4 draws throughout the combo, 2 of which are 4 card excavations. Monster reborn can substitute for a 2nd venus in this line &amp; keeps your saryuja's special summon free for something else.  Extensions (2):  Things get a bit tricker at this phase, as the board starts to clutter up &amp; available effects become few &amp; far between. This is also the parts of the solitaire game where my memory on what to do gets a bit muddled, if you've reached this stage you probably know what's up  If by some chance you haven't used Diviner yet, pull it out, then do the whole MFH schtick. Shine balls at this point can almost only be used for a Moon, or turned into tuners by Buten to get Jiujiu out, who gets a targeted non-destruct removal &amp; is well protected. Jiujiu can help declutter if desired, or if going second, just send away something you don't like. There's sometimes opportunities to convert Jiujiu into a level 8, but I can't remember the exact routes at the moment.  For the Route in E1 that ends in MMM &amp; Hyper Librarian, the best (maybe only way) to continue off of it is to have a Neptune in hand to sac for a DVenus in hand (or that somehow ended up in grave). Yada yada, Shiny Orb time, do some bs &amp; pop off however the hell you want. Summon a level 8, or if you're desperate for cards, Buten a Shine Ball &amp; synchro for Crocodragon for 2 new cards in hand.  If hyper librarian lands on board, don't worry too much about getting a bunch of cards off of it, it'll pretty often net you a card or 2, but can be safely used for synchro fodder if need be.  Ending:  Good place to be is generally with either/both L8 synchros &amp; Majesty Hyperion on board. Often Saryuja will be awkard to get rid of, so they'll buff anything you put in their linked zones.  With the amount of draw available in this deck, you're pretty damn likely to have Ecclesia or your other Dogmatikas in hand. If you pull Fleurdelis with Ecclesia on Turn 1, save it for turn 2 to negate an opponent's on board monster. If you're confident that an opponent needs their extra deck pieces (like this deck does), you can pull Dragma instead &amp; toss any ED leftovers. At this point anything left in the extra deck won't have much use aside from this (Avarice can also help recycle some stuff for Dragma).  Handtraps/Miscellaneous:  Herald of Orange Light is your protection against setups when you play turn 2 (Crystal Wing, Borreload Savage, etc.).  Called By is handtrap to handtrap negation, handtrap to handtrap communication. Don't use if opponent is just trying to ash blossom CVenus, since all it does is make you waste an extra 500 LP, and none of the combos require ALL your LP.  Dragged Down takes your opponent's hand and slaps Nibiru out of it. Be sure to not use this before you put your starter down though, as they discard from your hand too. (probably after 2nd or 3rd summon is the time to use this. 4th if you want to watch the life drain from your opponent's eyes)  Sacred Water of the Sky can pull a Neptune to your hand, which can sit as a combo extender, or wait til after you've activated Lost Sanctuary, so you can summon Majesty Hyperion on your opponent's turn  Genex Ally Birdman can bounce a Shine Ball summoned by CVenus for its summon, then CVenus can pull the Shine back and you can pull straight to a level 8 or 9. Don't recommend this unless it's your 2nd run of using CVenus' effect.  Arcana EX Light can summon off of Venus' Shine Balls &amp; potentially setup a spell/trap negate that can brick up to 4 cards. On the other side of this, it can become a heavy offensive threat, and return cards from grave to hand. Should be emphasized that this should be used to FINISH the main phase, as the spell/trap negation is involuntary and can stop some plays.  What does Pot of Greed do again?  Good luck with this deck, it's not too hard to get the hang of once you've started it, but it's easy to feel overwhelmed by how many cards end up in play."

The Synchro Monsters of the Ice Barrier break free in Structure Deck: Freezing Chains!  Originating in the very first Hidden Arsenal, the Ice Barrier strategy puts the freeze on opposing strategies while preparing to finish them off with their incredible Synchro Monsters! “Ice Barrier” monsters work as a team to suppress your opponent’s actions. There are “Ice Barrier” monsters that weaken opposing monsters, prevent your opponent from Tribute Summoning, delay the activation of Spell Cards, prevent attacks, and more, but only if you control a second “Ice Barrier” monster. If that second monster also has a similar suppression effect, you’ll get both effects!  The most famous “Ice Barrier” monster of all, Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier, returns in a new, even more destructive form in Structure Deck: Freezing Chains! Not only does this new Synchro Monster banish up to 3 cards your opponent controls, it also Summons the original Trishula if your opponent destroys it! This new Trishula can find a home in any strategy that can use Synchro Monsters, so don’t miss your chance to add this powerful monster to your Extra Deck.  Structure Deck: Freezing Chains includes all of the “Ice Barrier” Synchro Monsters as part of its 5-card Extra Deck."

DPE and Metalfoes, real straight forward","With DPE being one of the best boss monsters of this format, it's no surprise that he fits very well into FA Metalfoes a deck that has great synergy with destroying their own cards for searching and card advantage. This deck runs DPE as well as the basic Halifibrax combo that can end on 3 negates quite easily, you could also consider DPE as a backup strategy for when your main combo line gets disrupted. Other options for the deck include the artifact scythe lock with Dagda as any deck running DPE with a decent extra deck spam engine can consider Dagda.  The main combo line will start with trying to get two monsters, one being a tuner, to try and get out Halqifibrax, from here you simply summon the Deskbot 001 from the deck, link 3 into Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon get 3 tokens, summon the Deckbot 001 from grave with its effect, synchro 4 for a Quandax, use Auroradon's effect to tribute two tokens and summon a Phantom Beast from the deck, get Coltwing, summon the two tokens, and then synchro into Dawn Dragster and Borrel Savage. At this point, there are a bunch of extenders you could try going for, but you'll likely end with a Herald of the Arclight or a Baronne de Fleur/Ruddy Rose. IT may seem like a lot but it's pretty straightforward once you get a hang of it.  This combo is quite fragile and can be disrupted fairly easily by a lot of decks so you'll be a victim of games that feel like you lose at the coin flip but you have many options for going second. The deck works well with droplets as there are quite a good amount of cards that you'd like to be in the graveyard. And Dark Ruler no more is basically an auto-include since you can't really combo into most meta boards. If all that fails trying for a one synchro board plus gravity collapse does work quite well as shutting your opponent out of summons for the rest of the turn on a spell speed 3 is, as expected, really good."

Targets for negate are Invoked and utopia double. If i sp summon Ascended/Armed sage and normal summon Alisteir and the opponent negate the eff of Alisteir then i summon utopia double, the opponent use negate eff again but i chain with utopia double. If i used Ascended sage then i summon number 39, after c39 and then dragner. If i used Armed sage then i summon dragner or directly utopia leo ray (most of the times directly leo ray) if the opponent use negate effect for 3rd time in same turn then i can summon utopia lightning or wait the perfect moment (maybe bp) in his turn (utopia double quick eff) to summon utopia dragonik (5000atk), if the opponent target dragonik with card eff or for attack i can use the quick eff  to equip ZW monster from hand or deck (pegasus/tornado) - until the summoning of dragonik the opponent used 3 cards (negates) so he have 3 cards in his hand, he can't destroy dragonik by batle (almost impossible) so he need to target it by a card eff, with these 3 cards in hand will be very hard for him (absurd), keep in mind also that the summoning of dragonik was done by utopia double which is quick eff so i can chain in case he use something , dragonik is also quick eff. If there is no negates and he use just nibiro against me, after nibiro resolves i can summon Mechaba. So i will have mechaba and token with crazy atk. This strategy can work against the most common cards such as veiller, impermanence, nibiro, etc...  With onomatopaira and Ascended/Armed sage i can end on board: -If he use 1 negate against me then my board will be with ascended sage: dragner ,leo utopia ray, abyss dweller and in his turn i will summon number 22 or 41. -if he use 2 negates then my board is: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonik. -if he use 3 negates: my board: utopia double + Zubababancho and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonik (i can use the eff of bancho the next turn if he is still alive also). -if i used armed sage instead ascended sage, for 1 negate: dragner (i prefer to summon directly leo but i mention it because u can summon both dragner and leo), leo utopia ray, abyss dweller . -for 2 negates: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik. -for 3 negates: utopia double + Zubababancho (i can use the eff the next turn) and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik. -if i want to play safe and avoid nibiro i will just summon Ascended/Armed sage + Utopic Onomatopoeia and then utopia double and then directly utopia leo ray  and the next turn i will have follow ups in my hand.  I have 2 cards in my extra deck for some situations and a backup plan. Number 101: if i am in bad position and i need to clear the field but the opponent is with monster 3000atk+ then i use number 101, i attack and i use the eff to stay alive, then i summon Zeus and i clear the field. Number 101 is helpful in many situations. Utopia the Lightning: i usually summon that card only when i think dragonik is not needed and after 3 or more negates against me, it's helpful in other situations too.  BRICKS SOLUTIONS: -If u draw the spell double or nothing u can go directly with Ascended sage to number 39 ,after c39 ,dragner and etc. With Armed sage instead go to number 41 in defense or go to number 39 - c39 - utopia lightning +tornado. -If u draw pegasus, use Ascended sage for utopia double - number 39 - c39 - dragner - number 22 and in the opponent turn u can summon number 41 in defense after u resolved all your effects. -If u draw tornado or hyper rank up magic, is not big deal because they can be used from the hand, just keep in mind to use Armed Sage for utopia double and (if the opponent use negate eff or not) then add pegasus in hand and chain with utopia double- summon dragonic and equip tornado to him, after use the eff of dragonic to equip pegasus from your hand. -Note: if u are second, in every case try to attack with number 39 (+ double or nothing) and win the duel.  Important note: -in case the opponent try to use negate against u or other, u are able to chain with utopia double because of the activated eff of armed/ascended sage, keep it in mind. -if u use Armed sage, then go directly from utopia double to leo utopia ray (my reccomendation). -if u use armed + ascended sage together for utopia double, be careful which eff u activate first , be smart -Astral Kuriboh is needed in this deck as extra card combo for invoked and onomatopaira, beside Ascended/Armed sage. -You can win a duel with one attack. Combo with utopia double = number 39 = double or nothing. Be smart... -Leo utopia ray eff for negate and halving atk is forever, same goes for Dragonik.  -The deck is good going first/second also. -If u going first u have chance to open Aleister, Meltdown, Onomatopaira, Onomatopickup: 85% + pots = 92%. -If u going first u have chance to open Astral kuriboh, Ascended/Armed sage: 82% +pots = 90% -if u going second and the opponent have a very strong board, u can destroy that board by forbiden dropplet + dark ruler and u can give him a hard time with Forbidden Chalice: 71% chance to open + pots = 85%  This is my updated version, stronger than the previous one (the previous one was with dogmatika which was also good but if the opponent used negate eff then i would end on weak board, that's the reason for this currently update)  P.s. i updated this post few times, last update 31/12/2021."

There's now a lot of combinations of The Weather cards (I'll go over them in detail later) that can summon Rainbow in a single turn with an omni-negate ready.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>When this card resolves, you can place 1 “The Weather” Spell/Trap from your Deck face-up in your Spell/Trap Zone.</span></li>  	<li><span>You can only use each of the following effects of this card once per turn.</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you would Link Summon a “The Weather” Link Monster, you can also use face-up “The Weather” Spell/Trap cards in your Spell/Trap Zones as Link material, by treating them as “The Weather” Monsters.</span></li>  	<li><span>During the Main Phase, you can: Immediately after this effect resolves, Normal Summon 1 “The Weather” Monster.</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>You can only activate this card once per turn.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Changes in deck building</span>  <span>Before the deck was very, very slow. Snowy and Rainbowed Canvas would slowly gain you advantage until you could summon Rainbow and outgrind your opponent from there. Since all of your omni negates float back there's pretty much infinite grind. If a deck can't beat 3 omni negates a turn it can't beat this deck after setting up, that simple. But getting there took a while so people had to rely on floodgates like <span><a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a></span> to surive since all of your Weather Painters ""dodge"" the negate. They have great synergy with <span><a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a></span> since they remove themselves from the field, leaving your field empty so that Torrential only hurts your opponent and that Gamma can be activated during their turn still.</span>  <span>But the deck's tempo increased tenfold. You are now ending on your Link-3 turn 1, turning off Lose 1 Turn. Skill Drain negates Rainbow's effect to turn your other painters into little and adorable boss monsters. Both of these floodgates lose their strength and space in this deck. This creates not only a purer deck but also a deck that's more fun to play against (objectively speaking). If possible you like to keep Rainbow on the field so Torrential Tribute's much weaker in this deck, too. I kept it in for reason I'll go into later. I opted to keep Gamma in too, since it still has it's uses setting up the board and is strong going second. One brick is only half the bricks every other deck plays nowadays.</span><span> Wow Konami really put Skill Drain to three, huh. That does change things a wee bit. This deck is way faster and a good hand can turbo out Rainbow with a negate turn one but having 6 floodgates that turn off effects is crazy strong and it'd be a shame if this deck wouldn't make use of that. The glue that makes both Skill Drain and Rainbow work together so well is <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff9900;&quot;&gt;The Weather Painter Thunder&lt;/span&gt;""><span>The Weather Painter Thunder</span></a>. It sends both Skill Drain and Lose 1 Turn for cost, meaning its effect will resolve and you can out your own floodgate whenever YOU wish for it. Every card in this archetype is hyper accessible so getting to Thunder isn't a problem. So you either draw into the floodgates and can summon Rainbow once you have multiple Painters for negates to show for it or, if you don't draw into the floodgates summon her turn one, which is highly likely that you can do that, given that you didn't draw any of your six floodgates.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The combos and strategies</span>  <span>The main pieces of your combo are</span> <a data-name=""The Weather Painter Snow,""><span>The Weather Painter Snow</span><span>,</span></a> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Snowy Canvas"">The Weather Snowy Canvas</a></span> <span>and</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Forecast"">The Weather Forecast</a></span>.  <span>How to set-up Rainbow + 1 ""The Weather"" monster (during your opponent's SP):</span> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>The Weather Painter Snow + 1 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster OR Spell Canvas OR Forecast:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>NS Snow, activate effect to add Snowy Canvas <span>// other Spell Canvas if Snowy is drawn</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Snowy, banish Snow using Snowy's effect to add Forecast <span>// other Spell Canvas if Forecast is drawn</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, activating a Canvas from deck <span>// I prefer Thundery since it's very niche and I run two</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast to NS a Weather Painter from hand OR activate a Spell Canvas from hand</span></li>  	<li><span>link off Weather Painter and Canvases for</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow</a></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Snow during opponent's SP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>The Weather Forecast + 1 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, activating Snowy Canvas from deck</span></li>  	<li><span>NS a The Weather monster</span></li>  	<li><span>Banish it using Snowy's effect to add Snow</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast to NS Snow</span></li>  	<li><span>Snow effect to activate a Canvas from deck <span>// this is where I go for Thundery</span></span></li>  	<li><span>link off Snow, Snowy and the third Canvas for</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow</a></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Weather Painter during opponent's SP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>The Weather Snowy Canvas + 2 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monsters OR 1 Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster &amp; Spell Canvas other than Snowy OR Snowy Canvas and The Weather Painter Thunder:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Snowy Canvas <span>// activate Snowy first in case opponent uses imperm/veiler on your monster</span></span></li>  	<li><span>NS a Weather Painter</span> <ul>  	<li><span>If you opened Thunder and another Snowy Canvas: Use Thunder's effect here, sending Snowy for a different Canvas and then activate the second Snowy from hand</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Banish it using Snowy's effect to add Forecast</span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, activating a Canvas from deck <span>// still prefer Thundery</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Now either..</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Activate Forecast, NS second Weather Painter <span>// if you've drawn two Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monsters</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Activate Spell Canvas other than Snowy <span>// if you've drawn one Level 4 or lower ""The Weather"" monster and a Spell Canvas other than Snowy</span></span></li>  	<li><span>go to the next step if you've drawn Thunder and two Snowy since you already have 3 Canvases face-up</span></li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>link off Weather Painter and Canvases for</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Rainbow"">The Weather Painter Rainbow</a></span></li>  	<li>A<span>ctivate Weather Painter during opponent's SP</span></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <span>The Weather Painter Cloud is fantastic follow-up since it brings back two Canvases from the GY. Before they stayed on the field unless your opponent destroyed them but now that they are used as link materials playing a second copy of Cloud makes sense.</span>  <span>Thanks to Rainbowed Canvas you can slowly summon more and more Weather Painters. Once you have enough Weather Painters and Canvases set up you can use them to summon</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Painter Moon"">The Weather Painter Moon</a></span> <span>to link climb into</span> <span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></span> <span>while still having 1 or 2 Weather Painters linked to Rainbow for protection.</span>  <span>While the first turn setup consists of only one omni-negate and a summon negate (only if you must!), it's much better than before and quickly gains tempo on your following turn. Generic Trap Cards help maintain your first turn board.</span>  <span>If you open Torrential Tribute you can end on Moonbow + 1 Weather Painter pointed to it. A banish followed up with a board wipe is be better than a single omni-negate and Moonbow floats into Rainbow, enabling your negates during your turn. Your Weather Painter comes back before your opponent's monster banished through Moonbow, too.</span>  <span>Don't underastimate</span> <span><a data-name=""The Weather Auroral Canvas"">The Weather Auroral Canvas</a></span><span>. The ideal endboard doesn't rely on Auroral for interruption but if you can't get to that Auroral still provides a good threat against combo decks that rely on specific cards. Worst case it's link fodder.</span>  <span>For Spell Canvasas the only one besides Snowy I consider worth it to run is <span><a data-name=""The Weather Rainy Canvas"">The Weather Rainy Canvas</a></span>. It bounces your opponnt's S/T cards. While it doesn't negate it's strong against Field Spells and Continous Spells/Traps and to bounce Trap Cards during the EP. Technically works against Equip Spells too but when was the last time you saw a HOPT on one of these.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a></span> <span>is for consistency.</span> <span><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a></span> <span>or</span> <span><a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a></span> <span>can easily be played since the ED is very flexible. I think Extravagance is better in this deck than Prosperity. Extravagance should not be run with Piri Reis Map.</span>  <span>The Solemn traps are both strong offensively and defensively. IDP is strong too and doesn't look your like Dogmatika Punishment would. Punishment is therefore no longer a bugdet alternative. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Control, Midrange or Combo?</span>  I had to change this last section which was originally about running this as a combo deck, oriented on summoning Rainbow turn one as consistent as possible with handtraps instead of floodgates. With Skill Drain at three I don't think that's worth an idea anymore. Midrange is a loose term in yugioh but it sits kind of right between the other two. While control doesn't perform that many actions and control performs a whole lot of them, midrange are usually decks that have short combos and both elements of control and combo. This mostly resembles a control deck, yet it can be very explosive very early in the game. In this build I'm on a few handtraps to stop my opponent. Besides Gamma, which is definitely a must have, Imperm and Droll could both be switched out for control-oriented cards like Solemns or IDP. I don't think either choice is bad and it's not like I can go to locals and test it out. After all the release is still a few month away. I'm constently going back and forth and I do like the idea of Gamma and Imperm but I might switch out Droll for Solemn Strike or something like that, idk. Anyways I think this is going to be a fun deck to play. While floodgates are usually kind of stale the archetype has a fun gimmick, interesting cards and two really cool boss monsters and I'm looking forward to trying this out IRL."

Now that I've seen that the deck cost roughly $1200 at the time of writing this, I've decided to cut the expensive staples and make the deck cheaper (because let's be honest, if you're willing to spend that much money on cardboard, you may as well get a meta deck).  To start off, the single-greatest card ever printed (in my opinion), Darklord Nurse Reficule. This is your win condition (alongside Bad Reaction to Simochi), and as such the deck is designed to get this card out as quickly as possible or die trying. Banishment of the Darklords is extremely useful as it just simply adds 3 more copies of nurse to the deck. If this still isn't enough, 5 more consistency cards are included in Pot of Duality, Card of Demise, and Upstart Goblin.  Onto the burn cards, and the entire reason why you will win and lose games depending on how long Nurse and Simochi remain face-up. Gift Card and The Paths of Destiny are the best burn cards you have access to as, with Nurse or Simochi on board, they deal a flat 3000 or 2000 respectively to your opponent. The big-brained among you may have figured out that 3 Gift Card or 2 Gift Card and a Paths of Destiny will kill your opponent flat-out. That fact is why I included 2 Trap Trick in the list. Pretty straightforward. The less-than-straighforward burn cards are Dark Cure and Tri-and-Guess. Dark Cure is this deck's version of Maxx ""C"", as it can scare the opponent into making a much weaker board than they otherwise would have. It's not amazing though since it's entirely reliant on your opponent's gameplan, much like the other listed card, Tri-and-Guess. Now, since the extra deck with this list only has Link monsters, you just have to use that massive noggin of yours to figure out what kind of deck your opponent is playing and hope that it works. This of course falls apart if your opponent is on a Link-only extra deck, but hey that's what game 2 is for.  And now for the remaining garbage in the main deck. Condemned Witch is a really cool card since it can search one of the ""Forbidden"" quick-play spells. The last version of this list used Forbidden Droplet as the search target, but unless you already have copies of that card, Forbidden Chalice is the next-best choice. Witch also serves as another way to drop Nurse on the field, so we're now up to 9 copies of Nurse in the deck. Just Desserts is the easiest way for this deck to clean up a game. It's another card that's reliant on your opponent's field, but I think any deck other than Mystic Mine burn is gonna have at least a single monster on board for you to get value from. Dark Bribe is just the cheapest counter trap I could find that actually worked well with this deck. Solemn Judgment is always going to be better, but it's also always going to be more expensive.  The extra deck is just the cheapest set of Link monsters I could find that also technically benefit the deck. Just replace them with whatever half-decent links you have in your bulk because let's face it, you're never going into the extra deck with Nurse Burn.  The side deck is super variable as it all depends on matchups you might come across. If you have a friend who plays Jinzo, you're gonna need a card like Santa Claws or Raigeki to get rid of it. If you keep getting ruined by Imperial Order, use Heavy Storm Duster. If you're going second and want a cool way to remove a problem extra deck boss, use Psychic Eraser Laser for non-targeting, non-destruction removal with burn attached to it. Yes, this card outs Dragoon. I'm shocked as well.  As for other options, you can fix the deck by using more expensive cards that you actually own. Like adding Extrav or Prosperity to boost the consistency of the deck, or cosmic cyclone/lightning storm to clear problem backrow. Just don't buy those cards to use in fucking Nurse Burn"
