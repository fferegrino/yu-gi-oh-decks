If you have Gleipnir you can get a Guldafaxe to your hand(if you do not have one in your hand) and go for Thor.

The perk to the deck is having so many starters, starters for days. After that you need some Polys - Thunder Dragon Fusion is by far the best of these (we end on Battle Butler + Apollo). Instant Fusion is a +1 in a lot of our combos, and makes the cut for that - I could run Fusion sage, but I want 3 Thunder Fusion so that would be too much poly. Hand traps are hand traps - there's a 1 of Pank and Feather Duster to clear backrow, Droll for Dragon link, Imperm and Veiler for everything else. Not a perfect line-up but it's simple and I like it. Dragoon still exists, and generic effect negation is still strong in most matchups. Pot of Desires is OP in this deck - you literally never care about what you banish. Usually it's advisable to pull the 3 Battle Butler materials out first, but honestly, I like to just blindfire it away early in the turn as Ash bait. Usually don't like the card but it seems insane here.  &nbsp;"

The deck comes with an explanation for every card used in the deck.,"<span>Hey y’all! I’m back with another list! Today I have Traptrix, with some Paleozoic sprinkled into it! The deck is mainly focused around XYZ summoning (as 99% of my deck are lol), but has a few links, namely Traptrix Sera. Let’s start explaining the card choices, beginning with…</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Atrax: Definitely one of the best Traptrix monsters, this card hosts an impressive effect of protecting your normal traps from being negated, which will be incredible against countering many meta decks. More icing on the cake is the fact that it allows you to use your Hole normal traps straight from your hand instead of setting them onto the field, making them viable for destruction! This card is a staple 3 of in any Traptrix deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Dionaea: While the card may be god Traptrix support, as it can ss for free, it isn’t a card you want to open with, and thus is run only at 2. You’ll be wanting to use this card’s normal summon effect more than it’s special summon one, as it can lead to XYZ plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Myrmeleo: Really good search card for your traps, and its special summon allows you to pop a s/t for free, which will likely be followed by an XYZ play (considering that it’s most likely to be special summoned by another Traptrix monster).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traprix Mantis: While its search effect is extremely useful, it doesn’t do much else except offer a little bit of protection to your trap cards. And, Sera does what this card tries to do, but better. However, considering that the pool of Traptrix monsters is very, very limited, I run this at 2 to increase general consistency.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Genlisea: This card is great, as it can recover Hole trap cards from the GY, and search from the deck for very little cost. You’ll be wanting to abuse this card’s effect as much as you possibly can.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Nepenthes: While this card may, on paper, look like an extremely vital asset, it in reality is not. This is because the card is too slow, requiring you to activate a Hole trap card, instead of immediately special summoning/searching a Traptrix.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Bottomless Trap Hole: One of the most iconic Hole trap cards, maybe only next to Trap Hole itself (while looking through cards for this deck, by the way, Trap Hole is bugged to show Darkfall’s description when you hover over it). The card is one of the most useful traps in the deck, second to Infinite Impermanence and Paleozoic Dinomischus, as it allows for easy monster removal that doesn’t target, and banishes.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Gravedigger’s Trap Hole: This card is mainly used to protect your Traptrix Sera from pesky hand traps such as Ash Blossom. However, its effect allowing you to affect cards in the GY or that are banished is also extremely useful. The 2000 burn damage is also very nice to have.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence: This card is currently the best trap card in the format, functioning as both a hand trap, and a s/t negation if it was set to your field before activation. There is very little I can say about this card that hasn’t already been said. It’s an incredibly powerful metagame staple that is a required 3 of for any trap based deck, whether it be Traptrix or Paleo Frogs.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Network Trap Hole: A great Hole trap card, preventing summons from the deck and GY. However, it isn’t as useful as the above Bottomless Trap Hole, due to it not preventing most summons.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Canadia: Duel Links players probably got some PTSD from seeing this card’s name on this list! This card has a great way of removing problems without actually removing them. As well, since it is a Paleozoic trap card, it can special summon itself as a monster from the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Dinomischus: Dinomisc allows for some really easy removal, functioning as a better Bottomless Trap Hole in a way, as this card can banish ANY face up card, not just monsters. Also, the fact that it is a Paleozoic is great, as it can special summon itself, leading to potential rank 2 plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Olenoides: Really good s/t pop, functioning as this deck’s MST. It’s an extremely versatile trap card that is benefitted by the fact that it is a Paleozoic.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Trap Trick: Do I even need to say why this card is useful for this deck? This is one of the cards you want in your opening hand, as it can search any trap from your deck to immediately set to field, allowing it to be activated the turn it is set. Its sheer versatility in this deck makes it a requirement for this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare: A great negation trap card that will very likely receive a lot of use in your games.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus- Sky Thunder: I’m not very sure if I like the idea of placing a giant robot in a deck filled with insect/plant waifus, but it’s so good that leaving it out would be a crime against XYZ decks. This card is incredibly easy to summon, and has an amazing effect that is not limited to once per turn. Its board wipe invalidates a lot of decks, as it does not target or destroy. This is one of, if not, the best XYZ monsters currently in the format.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Time Thief Redoer: Redoer is a staple rank 4 XYZ monster that has the amazing effect of stealing an opponent’s card from the top of the deck. This card is well known for being hard to maneuver around, as it can simply banish itself to avoid any and all dangers that come its way. Not to mention its bonus effect once it steals your opponent’s cards are incredible, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Traptrix Allomerus: While this card is quite useful, and interacts with your opponent’s monsters well, it isn’t as versatile as the other Traptrix extra deck monsters. But, it does have quite a bit of use, as it special summons a Traptrix at the cost of 2 materials.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 41 Bagooska The Terribly Tired Tapir: Bagooska is a great generic rank 4, especially when you need to stall during a game. Its effect while in defense position can invalidate a large number of decks that rely on monster effects, and its ability to protect itself while in attack position is also very notable.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Tornado Dragon: What’s up with wyrm monsters having “dragon” in their name, despite not being dragon types? Anyways, this card is a staple for most decks that rely on rank 4 monsters, as it has spell speed 2 s/t destruction at a very low cost of detaching a material.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 101 Silent Honor ARK: Yet another staple rank 4! This card, only needing generic materials, is really easy to get on board, and immediately makes its presence known with its terrifying ability to steal an opponent’s monster as material. This card also has a protection effect, letting you use your opponent’s monster to save itself from destruction.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Rafflesia: An incredibly powerful monster, this card not only provides protection for all of your Traptrix monsters, but allows you to search a Hole trap card, and activate it by merely sending it to the GY. This card is the main XYZ monster you want to go for on turn 1, and summoning this card ensures a strong board presence.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Outer Entity Nyarla: Nyarla may seem like a bit of an odd choice for this deck in particular- but let me assure you there is a reason it’s here (that definitely isn’t because this is my favorite card). Its effect on summon includes a cost that discards, allowing for easy GY set-up. Its effect to attach a monster to itself as material, and steal its type/attribute can be very helpful to this deck, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toadally Awesome: Toadally Awesome is an incredible negate card, and is one that you absolutely need in any deck that includes Paleozoic trap cards. While its effect in the Standby Phase isn’t used for this deck, its negation certainly is. As well, it also allows you to set the negated card to your field, which can lead to cheesy steals of cards, whether they be staple spells and traps or important monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Opabinia: I opted to run 2 Opabinia over 1 Opabinia and 1 Anomalocaris, due to the latter having a difficult summoning condition to fulfill (any XYZ that requires 3 or more materials is automatically bad, unless it has an amazing effect to back it up). And, Opabinia’s effect of letting you activate Paleozoic traps from the hand is extremely valuable, as is its search effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Sera: This is one of the best link-1 monsters in the game, inspiring an entire engine due to its powerful abilities. This card is very likely one of the best in this deck, and increases its consistency tenfold. Its effect to special summon from the deck triggers many effects, notably Traptrix Myrmeleo, which lets you pop a s/t for free. This card can also set up lots of XYZ plays with its effect. And, when the effect of another Traptrix is activated, you can set a Hole trap card from your deck, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Traptrix Allomerus: This is in case you wanted another copy of this card, as it does have some decent use in this deck. I recommend swapping it out for a generic rank 4 such as Time Thief Redoer, or Bagooska.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Abyss Dweller: A generic rank 4 that can easily be swapped out for one of the other rank 4s.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Gagaga Cowboy: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: This card allows you to easily remove problem cards without destroying them, and is generally very easy to summon, requiring generic materials. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Phoenix: Good staple link that’s easy to summon, and offers a good s/t removal effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Break Off Trap Hole: This is one of the better Hole trap cards in this deck, but is kind of slow if your opponent does not run a deck focused on link monsters, and thus, is meant to be sided in.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Ice Dragon’s Prison: A generic trap card that offers incredible removal, or a monster to your board for XYZ/link summons.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Hallucigenia: One of the more decent Paleozoic traps, however, this card does not do as much as the others, and is put in the side deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Marrella: Good for GY set-up.</span>"

SS Formula Synchron, SS Marcher, effect Marcher to summon back stone.  Step 3: Summon Elpy using stone, summon Protector Whelp using Marcher and Linkross.  Step 4: Effect Elpy to summon Seyfert/Brotaur (Seyfert priority). Effect Seyfert to discard Blue-eyes you drew using stone to grab Levianeer (Chaos Emperor if you have Levi onhand already, or Alternative if you have both)  Step 5: Summon Pisty using Seyfert. Banish 3 LIGHT (including Blue-eyes White Dragon) to summon Levianeer. Effect Levianeer to summon Stone. Effect Pisty to summon banished Blue-eyes.  Step 6: Summon Saryuja using the 3 link monsters and Levianeer. Banish Seyfert to put Levianeer back into your hand. Don't forget to Draw 4 put back 3. (Yay you can put back red-eyes Fusion you hard-draw)  Step 6.5: Situational if you have Chaos Emperor onhand. Use its Pendulum effect to put banished Seyfert back to hand.  Step 7: Pick and Roll. Choose into your liking: <ul>  	<li>Effect Saryuja to summon any LVL 8. Xyz into Draglubion. Use Saryuja and stone to summon Hieratic Seal. Draglubion effect to summon Hope for interruption or Numeron Dragon for OTK.</li>  	<li>Special summon any LVL 8 (Danger!, Chaos Emperor, Alternative). Xyz into Photon Lord. Then effect Saryuja to summon another LVL 8. Summon Levianeer again if you have the resources in grave. Xyz into Hope. Link Saryuja and stone for Hieratic Seal (or Verte into Dragoon if you're feeling it). PS. Draglubion and Verte cannot be on the same turn, unless you don't want to use Draglubion's effect.</li> </ul> Note: Play around handtraps by trying to hold off normal summon and using extenders first, summoning Halq means everything to this. If Halq is handtrapped, either normal summon stone (if you have), use quick launch or one for one to get to your LVL 1, or summon anything to get into Verte to have Dragoon at least. If you also have LVL 8 extenders, you can XYZ into anyone you like. Peep the LVL 8 Alpha, Master of Beasts on side deck for going second ;)"

Siding options primarly to make going second an almost guaranteed win, even against Dragon-Link and Infernoble.  Magical Musketeer Mastermind Zakiel to gain card advantage in opponents turn.  Pot of Avarice, Raigeki, Daigusto Emeral and Honest as techs for grindgame-competency.  Cyber Dragon Nova and Invoked Mechaba as your usual anti-Dogmatika-tech.  Light on handtraps to allow for more archtype-internal control options, (all Magical Musketeer Monsters turn the Magical Musket spells/traps into handtraps anyways) also allows Magical Musketeer Kidbrave (and secondarily Magical Musketeer Wild &amp; Magical Musketeer Doc, aswell as Magical Musketeer Calamity) to be active and gaining advantage (or negating disadvantage) more often, this is accounted by only playing 1 Pot of Avarice, I'd opt for 2 in a handtrap-heavier version of this deck. (Running no Pot of Avarice takes a lot of grindgame-competency from this deck, as you will draw and search through your deck very rapidly)  I chose not to play Dark Ruler No More! and Evenly Matched as I believe this deck can do without blowouts like those.  This Deck can very much compete with top-tier decks if played correctly.

Most decks just can't deal with it. The problem is getting it on the field.  Nothing revolutionary here, just a deck with what I think is a good ratio and some nice techs to get to Magnus trun 1.  The deck falls pretty easily to handtraps. It's far from competitive but well-piloted it thrives in a casual environment.  Take the time to test the combos. It's not easy at first, but it works.

Here's one that's kind of alright for a semi-competitive format,There's no Elpy/guardragon. They are nice but they make the deck more linear and easier to stop. I prefer a more pure and adaptable version with no real chokepoint.  Dragonmaid Sheou is a great boss monster that litteraly comes back every turn. The deck has a hard time on the first turns but if you manage to go to the grind game you should be able to win. The deck can really hold the distance and keep the advantage.  It's a fun strategy. It needs some skill and good decision-making but it's solid.

The big Evil Twins monster is in the side deck in case you want to play it but I never felt like the deck needed it. It's not a good boss monster. Bagooska and Saros are nice techs that are both fiends and thus don't conflict with the restriction of the link-2.  Overall it's a pretty fun deck that can somewhat compete with the meta on a low rogue level. Have fun.

Let's not forget that it is searchable by <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch</a>.  <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>, hand trap very useful against some types of decks, you can replace it with any other ht or staple.  <hr /> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgjIzG1mTF8</p>"

It is fun, and can win you games.","This the raidraptor deck that I used to participate in CryptidYgo's Writer Guild Revel's Tournament.The rules was that 67.5 of the main, side, and extra deck had to be 67.5 of one archtype. For 41 cards that is 27 in the main. In the extra deck, that is about 10-11 cards from one archtype. I looked at many decks including sky strikers, raidraptors, cyber dragons, and even ancient gears. In the end I choose raidraptors, because I was comfortable with them, and they made good boards. Also they were very consistent. This deck wants to go first, and set up its board. With just Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius, and Raidraptor- Vanishing Lanius, you can end on Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon, D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga on opponents turn, Gagagaga Magician, Cyber Dragon Infinity and The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche. As long as you can get a way to get to Raidraptor- Wise Strix( The link monster), and a level four monster, you can get full combo. A video of me doing a test hand will be coming soon.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMvWc8q_mXY&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>  This was a small tournament, and I go 4-0 in the swiss rounds. In the top cuts I go against charmer, and mayakashis.  The first round of top cut against charmers, I win the dice roll, and go first. I manage to set up my board without any interruption and win. The second game, my opponent goes first, and sets up a board with Village of the Spellcasters, which means there is nothing I can do, so I surrender. The last game was much like the first game.  In the finals, I go against a Mayakashi player that I faced in swiss. I was lucky, and won the dice roll. The first game I got my board, and negated all of my opponents  effects during their turn, and otked them. The second game I go second, and I could have won, if I wasn't dumb, and forget to activate my set Rank-Up- Magic Soul Shave Force earlier in the turn to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity to take their Mayakashi link three. This leads me to get OTKed after losing half my lifepoints plus not reading card effects and losing 1000 more.This leads me getting hit by Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi for game. The last game, I go first, and set up my board, and otk them the following turn.  In the end I won the tournament with a 8-2 record.  In conclusion, the tournament was fun, and I highly recommend people checking out the discord for future events.  It's ""The Yugioh Writers Guild""  <span>Monsters-27</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius-</span><span> This can is very important because this can send any Raidraptor card from your deck to your graveyard. You usually send Raidraptor- Mimicry Lanius, or Raider’s Wing. However a cool interaction with Raidraptor- Heel Eagle is that if you have Heel Eagle in your hand, you can normal summon Tribute Lanius, and send any Raidraptor spell or trap, and special summon Heel Eagle, and go into Wise Strix. After using Wise Strix’s effect, you can banish Heel Eagle, and add to your hand the spell or trap that was sent. The second of this effect doesn’t come up since you usually xyz or link with Tribute Lanius before the second main phase.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Stangle Lanius-</span><span> This card is a once per turn special summon if you control a dark monster. If you special summon this card from your hand, you can still use its effect to special summon a  level 4 or lower raidraptor from your graveyard when a xyz monster you control that has a dark xyz monster under it is on the field. During the combo, you summon this off of Raidraptor- Arsenal Falcon.  Don’t forget that if you use the summon from the graveyard effect, you are locked into darks which isn’t that bad.</span>  <span><span>Dynatherium-</span> </span><span>I run this card because I had one slot open, and this card is a free special summon going first or second. The only drawback is that your opponent then can special summon a level 4 monster from either player’s graveyard. However,if you go first and this is in your opening hand, the drawback isn’t an issue. Surprisingly at one copy this card came into my hand more often than not.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius-</span><span>This can is a free special summon of a level 4 or low Raidraptor from the hand. You use this special summon Raidraptor monster like Mimicry, Tribute Lanius, or any other Raidraptor cards that can’t special summon themselves. The best thing about this card is that it’s once per turn, so if you open two, you can use both of their effects. </span>  <span>Raidraptor- Mimicry Lanius-</span><span> While this card doesn’t special summon itself, and it doesn’t have a good normal summon effect, this card is still needed. If you send this card to the graveyard, the turn it was sent, you can banish it to add any Raidraptor card from your deck. Its other effect is that it can increase the level of all raidraptor monsters by one, but that doesn’t come up at all. </span>  <span><span>Raidraptor- Singing Lanius-</span> </span><span>This card is only a free special summon, when you control a face up XYZ monster. You usually search this with Force Strix so you can special summon it right away. Honestly I would play one of it since it’s searchable, and can’t freely special summon itself.</span>  <span><span>Raider’s Wing-</span> </span><span>This card can special itself out by detaching a material from a Dark xyz monster you control. This is good because you can special summon it off of Raidraptor- Wise Strix, use it for xyz material, then special summon it back using its effect. Also if it leaves the field after using its effect it’s banished. You get around this by reusing it as a xyz material so when it's sent to the graveyard it isn’t banished.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Heel Eagle-</span><span> This card can special summon itself from your hand, if all monsters you control are Raidraptors. This is good, because you want to get three monsters on the board. Three monsters equal full combo. Its second effect where it can banish itself from the graveyard to add a Raidraptor spell/ trap from your graveyard doesn’t come up often but it’s something that is useful.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knight of Silent Boot- </span><span>This card as you know is the only brick. I mean if you draw it, it hurts the combo, because then you can’t go into Arsenal Falcon without Magic Force. The reason that I run two is because in case I draw one, there is still one in my deck.</span>  <span><span>Caligo Claw Crow-</span> </span><span>This card is so good, because it's a free winged beast that can special summon itself if you control a dark monster. You can use this card for Wise Strix which gets your combo started. If this wasn’t once per turn, or if it was level 4 it would be more broken.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Pain Lanius-</span><span> This card can special summon itself by targeting one Raidraptor monster that has a level. You take damage equal to the lower of the monster’s stats, and then special summon this card. This card then becomes the level of the monster. You can’t target Raider’s Wing because you have to take damage, and Raider’s Wing lowest stat is 0. Therefore you don’t damage , and it doesn’t work. Also on a side note, this card can only be used as a xyz material for a winged beast monster.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Note- If you count the number of monsters that can special summon themselves, you get 16 which means that 59% of the monsters are extenders.</span>  <span>Spell-10</span>  <span>Raidraptor-Nest-</span><span> This card can add any Raidraptor monster from your deck or graveyard if you control two or more Raidraptor monsters. This card is good, because it can search extra extenders without locking you into Raidraptors. You could run this at one, since it’s searchable off of Mimicry.</span>  <span>Foolish Burial-</span><span> This card is neat, because it can send Raider’s Wing or Raidraptor- Mimicry. If your opponent negates the Wise Strix, you can use foolish to send the Raider’s Wing, and continue your combo making your opponent waste a handtrap. Also you could send Mimicry to get any Raidraptor card from your deck to your hand.</span>  <span>Harpie’s Feather Duster-</span><span> This card is for backrow decks, and annoying field spells. In testing and the tournament, I found that I need some trap backrow destruction in case my opponent plays  Secret Village of the Spellcaster.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Call-</span><span> This card can target a Raidraptor monster, and special summon another one from the deck. While this is good, the bad part of this is that it locks you into Raidraptor. Therefore I never used this card in the tournament, and I probably would have cut it, and added more of the counter trap.</span>  <span><span>Rank- Up-Magic Soul Shave Force-</span> </span><span>This card is used to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity by paying half your life points. If you don’t want to make Infinity, you could also make True King of Calamities.</span>  <span>Phantom Knights’ Rank-Up- Magic Force-</span><span> This card is great because it can target any dark xyz monster, and rank it up equal to the number of dark monsters you banish from your graveyard. This makes Raidraptor- Arsenal Falcon. The reason we play two is because, if the game lasts more than three turns, you can go into Revolution Falcon to pop a monster, and deal damage, or Satellite Cannon Falcon to destroy all of your opponent's backrow, and weaken your opponent's monsters.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch- </span><span>This card is used to summon Kali Yuga on your opponent's turn. It’s graveyard effect can attach a Phantom Knight monster from your hand to a Dark xyz monster you control.</span>  <span>Traps-4</span>  <span>Raidraptor’s Phantom Knights Claw- </span><span>This is a counter trap that can negate a monster effect by detaching a material from a dark xyz monster you control. Then one Raidraptor xyz monster gains attack equal to the attack of the monster.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Readiness-</span><span> While this card is useful, it is not required in the deck. It makes your Raidraptor monster indestructible by battle for one turn, and it can banish itself from the graveyard to make you take no battle damage that turn. You can activate both effects on the same turn if needed.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine-</span><span> What this card does, is that if you have no traps in the graveyard, then you can activate it the turn you set it to be a normal level four monster. This is great, because you can use it for xyz summoning, and it isn’t a dead card in your opening hand. To top that, if you already have one of the rank up spells, you can add this off of silent boots.</span>  <span>Extra Deck-15</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Ultimate Falcon-</span><span> This can is unaffected by everything, and you summon it off of Arsenal Falcon being destroyed by its own effect, or your opponent’s effect. This card is a baby Zexal on your turn, because if you detach one material, it makes your opponent monsters lose 1000 attack and defense, and prevents your opponent from activating effects for the rest of the turn. It’s other effect is that if it has a Raidraptor monster underneath, during the end phase it makes all of your opponent monster’s lose 1000 attack. If your opponent doesn’t have a face up monster you can burn your opponent for 1000. That is useful, if you are playing into time.</span>  <span><span>D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga-</span> </span><span>This card is the win condition of the deck. You summon this card on your opponent’s turn using Rank-Up Magic Launch in order to negate all of your opponent’s on field effects. Its second effect is that it has a quick effect heavy storm to destroy all spells and traps on the field.</span>  <span>Raidraptor - Satellite Cannon Falcon- </span><span>This card is here for later in the game if you need to destroy all of your opponent's spell and traps. Also it can detach a material to target one opponent monster and make it lose 800 for each Raidraptor monster in your graveyard.</span>  <span>Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcón-</span><span>This rank 7 xyz monster can detach one material to special summon anyone Raidraptor monster from your deck. The good thing about this is that it doesn’t negate the monster’s effect. Also if it’s sent to the graveyard it can summon out any Raidraptor xyz monster.</span>  <span><span>Cyber Dragon Infinity-</span> </span><span>This is the card, you usually summon with Soul Shave Force. This card can attach one attack position monster to it, and it can negate one card by detaching one material from it. </span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon-</span> This card is usually summoned off of Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon. Its effect includes detaching one material to attack all monsters, and if it attacks a special summoned monster, it makes the monster’s attack 0. Another effect that it has is that if it has a Raidraptor xyz monster, it can destroy one monster your opponent controls and deal damage equal to halve the attack.</span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon - Air Raid-</span> This is the rank 6 that you summon if you played Strangle Lanius, since it locks you into darks.The alternative way to summon this card is by discarding a rank up magic spell and ranking it on a rank 5 or lower Raidraptor monster. This card doesn’t have a negate, but when it’s summoned it can destroy one monster your opponent controls, and deal damage to your opponent. Also if it is destroyed it floats into Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon - Air Raid</span>  <span>Ice Beast Zerofyne-</span><span> I like this card because it can negate the effects of all face up cards that your opponent controls. This is useful because it can negate floodgates, and other annoying cards.</span>  <span><span>Gagagaga Magician-</span> </span><span>This card is solely used to bring back Arsenal Falcon to make Kali Yuga.</span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Blade Burner Falcon-</span> This card can gain 3000 attacks if the difference between your and your opponent's life points is 3000 or more. This card can be used to crash into Dragoon, or attack a weaker monster and pop up to two cards when using its effect.</span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Force Strix-</span> </span><span>This card is essential to the deck, because it searches the deck for any level 4 Dark winged beast. This card allows you to add more extenders to combo off.This card is a soft once per turn meaning that each copy can add a dark winged beast once per turn.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche-</span><span> This card can pop cards if a dark xyz monster is special summoned to a zone this card points to. That is nice, but the reason that this was banned was because it can send a Phantom Knight card to the graveyard to set a phantom knight spell or trap.This sends Silent Boots to get more advantage. Side note, if for some reason you draw both Silent Boots, you could alway send Raider’s Wing since it is a Raidraptor, and Phantom Knight card.</span>  <span>Raidraptor - Wise Strix- </span><span>This card can special summon a level 4 dark winged beast from the deck, negating its effect. That  monster can’t be used as a link monster, but that doesn’t matter when you are going to use it as xyz material. Its other effect is that when a Raidraptor xyz monster activates its effect, you can set one rank up spell card. Even if it’s a quick play, you still can use it the turn you set it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side deck- For the side deck, it is up to each individual person, and what the meta currently is. My suggestion is to run backrow removal like twin twisters, and heavy storm duster in case your opponent has Secret Village of the Spellcasters. Also run hand traps like Nibiru, The Primal Being, Ash Blossom, or even Infinite Impermanence.

What could possibly go wrong?,"<span>Hey, I’m back with my horrible ideas! I’m not sure if you remember this Cyber Dragon engine I came up with, but here it is again, this time in Orcust! If you want to see the Ancient Gear/Cyber Dragon deck, check it out <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/ancient-gear-cyber-dragon-engine/"">here</a>. I will be explaining my choices of cards, and why I play them. Starting with…</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher: Starting off with Gizmek Orochi, this monster is played for a couple of reasons. One being that it is easy to summon, and its summoning condition of banishing cards from the top of the deck isn’t much of a hindrance to this deck. Its level and attribute match up well with the Orcust cards, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x World Legacy- “World Wand”: The card is primarily used for its banishing effect once in the GY, and not its effect when sent. However, it is a good idea to use it if you happen to have another copy in hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcust Knightmare: This is a one of, due to its status as a garnet. You won’t be wanting to see this card in your hand, and want it in your GY. Send it with cards like Foolish Burial, as this is one of the better targets for it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Cyber Dragon: The most important card of the Cyber Dragon engine, this card’s amazing effect gives you an edge when going second.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight: Definitely the best Orcust main deck monster. This card’s summon effect is great, and you’ll want to take advantage of it the best you can. Especially its bonus effect of summoning a token. You won’t usually be taking advantage of its effect to make itself a tuner, however, as you’ll be linking this card off.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Dark Grepher: The much better version of Armageddon Knight, this card’s ability to special summon itself is easy to abuse in this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Armageddon Knight: Its effect to send a DARK monster to the GY for free is amazing, and you’ll want to take advantage of this the best you can.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcust Cymbal Skeleton: Its GY effect is great, but the fact that it locks you into DARK monsters (along with Orcust Brass Bombard) means that you’ll want to set up your Cyber Dragon plays first.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Scrap Recycler: Its ability to send a Machine, instead of plainly a DARK monster, makes it function as a better Armageddon Knight in this deck. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Cyber Dragon Core: The card that makes the entire Cyber Dragon Engine function. Normal Summon this, and add your Cyber Emergency to add a regular Cyber Dragon to hand. Or, add Cyber Revysystem if you already have a Cyber Dragon in hand. Then, link it off or summon a Chimeratech fusion monster.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Knightmare Corruptor Iblee: You’ll be wanting to send this card to the GY in order to lock your opponent out of special summons, or to set up some plays with Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcust Brass Bombard: Its GY effect is great, but the fact that it locks you into DARK monsters (along with Orcust Cymbal Skeleton) means that you’ll want to set up your Cyber Dragon plays first.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cyber Pharos: This card has an easy to fulfill summoning condition, and a great effect, which can allow you to summon a machine fusion monster, using materials from the hand or field. The target you’ll be trying to go for is Cyber Eternity Dragon, as it is an incredible card in this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcustrated Babel: Its effect to make Orcust cards have quick effects is great, however it doesn’t do much else to justify having it at more than just a 1 of.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Allure Of Darkness: An incredible card for any Orcust deck, this card lets you draw 2 cards AND banish a DARK monster from your hand (which will usually be an Orcust card). There is very little downside to this card in Orcust.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Cyber Emergency: Part of the Cyber Dragon engine, this card is used to add a Cyber Dragon (or Cyber Dragon Core in some circumstances) to your hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cyber Revysystem: Part of the Cyber Dragon Engine. Use this to special summon your Cyber Dragons from the hand or GY to use them for link or fusion plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Foolish Burial: An incredible staple card that is a must have for any Orcust deck (or any deck that wants cards in the GY).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcustrated Return: Same reasons as Allure Of Darkness, however you have to discard an Orcust for its effect, and it is a hard once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Eternity Dragon: This card is going to be your main target for Cyber Pharos. It’s an incredible beatstick, and will likely beat over most cards your opponent throws at it. Its floating effect is pretty good too, and its banish effect, while not seeing as much use in this deck, is still notable.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon: The best Chimeratech card; this lets you remove problem cards such as Accesscode Talker or Apollousa from your opponent’s field for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Invoked Mechaba: This card is used as the target for Cyber Dragon Nova’s floating effect. It may be situational, but it is quite useful if that situation were to ever arise.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star: Really easy summoning condition to fulfill, whether you bring it out properly or through its effect. You’ll be wanting to keep this card on the board as long as possible.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova: You’ll be summoning this card with 2 Cyber Dragons. The card itself isn’t very important, except for its floating effect, which you’ll be summoning Invoked Mechaba with.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova: You will ALWAYS use the alternative summoning condition for this card. It has an incredible non-destruction removal effect, and its negate is also incredible. Not to mention it’s impressive body, and you have one very hard to remove card on your hands.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcustrion: The card can be a pain to summon for not much of a payoff. However, its removal effect is quite decent.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Longirsu, The Orcust Orchestrator: This card is basically the much better version of Orcustrion. It’s easier to summon, and has the same effect. Please, use this over Orcustrion.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: What hasn’t been said about this card already? It has an incredible non-destruction removal effect, and is very easy to summon.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Sieger: This card’s main use is to boost your cards, namely Dingirsu, to make them massive beatsticks. But, the effect can also be used on itself to help it remove problem cards.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Galatea, The Orcust Automation: Easily the best Orcust link monster, you’ll want to use this as much as you possibly can in order to generate advantage with cards like Orcustrated Return.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x I:P Masquerena: I:P Masquerena has cemented itself as a staple link monster, as it has incredible arrows, a great effect, and is easy to summon. This card will likely be a meta game staple for years to come.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Linkuriboh: Link off unnecessary Cyber Pharos or Orcust Brass Bombard with this.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcust Cymbal Skeleton: In case you wanted more copies of this card in the deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcust Brass Bombard: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcustrated Einsatz: This card isn’t incorporated into the main deck due to how slow it is, and the fact that it doesn’t do much of anything anyways.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcustrated Babel: For if you wanted to see this card more often, instead of having to set it with Galatea.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Dark Ruler No More: Great going second card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Lightning Storm: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Forbidden Droplet: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;"

Powerful Cards Like <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> only can use their on-board effects on an opponent’s already established board. This build takes advantage of two main cards <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a>.  <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> lets you discard it and a Nekroz ritual spell to stop your opponent from special summoning from the extra deck during Main Phase 1. Since a player can’t enter battle phase and therefore main phase 2 turn 1, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> is electively a hand trap version of <a data-name=""Domain of the True Monarchs"">Domain of the True Monarchs</a> turn 1. Also every Nekroz ritual spell lets you banish itself and one Nekroz monster to search another ritual spell, giving you back much needed value when discarded with <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a>.  <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> is an often underutilized tool that has the following effect on field: “Your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of a ""Nekroz"" Ritual Spell Card“ And “""Nekroz"" Ritual Monsters you control cannot be targeted by an opponent's card effects“. This card lets you play around negates that would stop your ritual summons. <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> combined with a ritual summon of <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> can easily disarm your opponent’s monster negates, without them being able to stop it. Its effect when tributed, while not the main reason for its usage in the deck is also relevant allowing for recycling of resources in longer games. It also should be noted that as this card is a level 4 water monster it aids in making <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and then <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>.  The Dogmatika engine in the deck serves a dual purpose going second. It first searches out Nekroz cards by sending <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> to grave. It also provides additional card destruction and presence through sending <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> to grave multiple times. For example, <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> can result in a total of two card destructions and a search by searching for and setting up <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>. This engine Combines the searching and board presence of the Impcantation archetype with board clearing.  The Deck also utilizes cards <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>. These function as a standard blowout package and can simply dismantle in one un-interactable sweep.  <strong>The Math and Consistency</strong>  While it’s not perfect odds, this deck is optimized to have some form of blowout over about 90% of the time. The Deck will simply draw one of <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, or <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> around 79.85% of the time. That’s a healthy base for going second but what else does it have? The deck opens <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and a ritual spell in 18.56% of games, that’s about 1 out of every 5 where your opponent can’t use their extra deck to set up negates to stop your ritual summons.  Outside of these blowouts let’s look at Nekroz’s inherent searchability. 10/42 cards in the deck search another nekroz card with no questions asked. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> gets you any Nekroz Monster which gets you <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a> who in turn gets you any Nekroz Ritual spell. Another 16/42 cards search Nekroz cards with a bit of setup. Due to Nekroz’s heavily search reliant playstyle it’s very hard to calculate how many negates on average this deck can play through. From personal experience being able to play through 1 negate is almost guaranteed, 2 negates is common enough, and 3 negates can be done with a lucky enough hand.  <strong>Side Deck and Extra Deck.</strong>  This deck struggles quite a lot against non-extra deck focused decks. Thats not to say its unwinnable but that’s what the side deck is for. We run a backrow destruction package in the form of <a data-name=""Harpie’s feather Duster"">Harpie’s feather Duster</a> and Three copies of <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>. The rest of the cards enable the deck to be played going first. The additional copies <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> are there for the classic nekroz play of setting up a floodgate with <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> style battle protection. <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> combine with any spellcaster Nekroz monster just shuts down any spell-based deck. Last but not least <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> is an easy disruption card for Nekroz to play with as more often than not only one of each type of monsters will be on the field at once.  Most of the Extra deck is focused around enabling <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a> and <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>. <a data-name=""Herald of the Ark Light"">Herald of the Ark Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> are commonly used for effects when ritual summoning. The full <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> combo will send two <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> and one <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light to Grave"">Herald of the Arc Light to Grave</a>. <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> also has a relevant graveyard effect for recursion.  Everything else was chosen because they either recycle themselves or can not be special summoned off of an opponent’s <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> type effects. I also tried to set these up to play around not giving Light and Fire attributes to <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, but several levels didn’t feature enough monsters to do this Perfectly. <a data-name=""Nepthys, The Sacred Flame"">Nepthys, The Sacred Flame</a>, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>, and <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> are all situation tools the deck can use.  <strong>Relevant Matchups</strong>  <em>Dragon Link &amp; Infernoble Knights</em> – This deck forgoes most hand traps in favor of blowouts. The Goal is simple drop a board clear or negate and then resolve a <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> or <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> to keep them out of the game and destroy their resources.  <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> stops these decks from doing anything. If you have to play through negates bait with Nekroz Ritual spells and monsters first as they are recursive.  <em>Virtual World</em> – Admittedly <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> is a problem for this deck to deal with. The solution lies in going first. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> or <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a> are an easy play here. Cards like <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a>, <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spell Casters"">Secret Village of the Spell Casters</a> and <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> are easy side deck options here. If you have to play through <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> just see if you can remove it and stop them from making another one.  Your options vary greatly depending on what attribute they call. If they chose light nekroz search effects are live if they chose water <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> and <a data-name=""Hearld of the Arc Light"">Hearld of the Arc Light</a> can still resolve. Also, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> stops this deck from doing anything turn one.  <em>Zoodiac </em>- Tons of options in this matchup. If they make you first <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> stops their game plan entirely. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> also works going first here Now you can search it and the needed discard fodder to cancel out their plan of making <a data-name=""Zoodiac Boarbow"">Zoodiac Boarbow</a> and making <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder</a>. If they play <a data-name=""Alpha, the Master of Beasts"">Alpha, the Master of Beasts</a> try to make two <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore </a>to stop them from playing through one. Going second gives you a pretty solid advantage. They’re likely to only end on one monster to play around <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> and <a data-name=""the Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode"">the Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode</a>, and just depend on backrow instead. <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> and <a data-name=""Harpie’s Feather Duster"">Harpie’s Feather Duster</a> are your friends here. You don’t have a lot of outs to <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"">Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</a>, so stop them from making it in the first place instead. Also, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> stops this deck from doing anything turn one.  <em>Dinosaurs</em> – This deck is very likely to run through you if you go first. Nekroz and Dogmatika are anti-extra deck engines and dino’s often don’t need theirs. <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyus"">Nekroz of Valkyus</a> a very effective side deck option here. Almost always side out <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a>. Going second you can run through them but make sure to target gas cards like <a data-name=""Miscellaneosaurus"">Miscellaneosaurus</a> with <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> if you can’t OTK.  <em>Eldlich</em> – Theres a lot of varaity in this deck. General goal is to try and use <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> to try and banish all copies of <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Gungir"">Nekroz of Gungir</a> is your friend in this match up as Nekroz don’t have a ton of backrow removal on their own. Side in <a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> and <a data-name=""Harpies Feather Duster"">Harpies Feather Duster</a>. Side out <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> and <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode</a>, and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> if they’re not playing an extra deck focused build.  <strong>Side Note</strong>  This deck is an edit of a previous deck I made found here.  https://ygoprodeck.com/go-second-nekroz/  Most of the relevant mathematical value have been increased by only 1-2% but added all together in makes a dramatic difference. The real value comes from the added cards in the Dogmatika engine which gives more value and helps better play through negates and the swap for <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> which is more in line with the deck’s focus."

Big wind handtrap slot (for Wynn fodder, making us have 9 starters with Ice/Gl","Obvious synergy between the new Diamond Bell and Trickstar cus Trickstar burn multiple times triggering Diamond Bell pop twice. Gizmek Uka also burn multiple times while locking your opponent with Barrier Statue. Ratio is explainable, we run the Ice and Glass Bell at 3 cus they generate advantage easily, 2 Freeze and Snow Bell cus we can summon them more than once later, only 1 Blizzard Bell and Chime cus they only do a little. As for Chime, we only run small pool of Windwitch which means hard to meet its condition (even fulfilled, most of the Windwitches we run already generate advantage, so no point for Chimes). The rest of the deck is just good wind monster (handtraps), so Wynn has bigger chance to activate.  Uka can be triggered by the top tier that use Halq, Titaniklad, Scarlet Sanguine, any Prank-Kids, Adaman, Zoodiac Barrage, Thunder Dragonroar, and Emergency Teleport. The interaction however, only good against certain matchup depends on Uka's summon target.  Pros: Consistent interruption control with big handtrap lineup.  Cons: No recursion, longevity depends on what we draw (double Ice/Glass Bell), although the duel is cut shorter thanks to the cheap burn damage."

Use Pot of Avarice and J of Avarice to return cards back to deck, since you can get rid of most of your deck in one turn with Lightsworn engine.

But in case you have bad cards or your opponent negates an important combo move, it provides a lot of protection to last more rounds. Uses a lot of special summoning to get monsters to the field, graveyard and back to the field. When Sangan or Witch of the Black Forest is sent to the graveyard and you can add 1 monster to your hand, instead of always drawing an exodia piece, when you see that you can draw another monster that enables to start a combo then go for it because the combo will allow you to end up with more pieces. When you combo right you can draw 4 exodia pieces in 1 turn. Always try to get a card that starts a combo, one wrong added card can lose you the duel. The Kuribohs are very important both for protection and special summoning, very effective with Emisarry of the Afterlife since his effect is not once per turn. Weak against decks that summon a monster that can negate once per turn and against mystic mine. But in case of a match the side deck has useful cards to go against these decks in the next duel."

The strat is simple... Set up with Zombie World, Rivalry, Doomking Balerdroch, and Dragoon and you got yourself a solid board. You could use Impermanence in the place of Gravedigger's Trap Hole, but I believe that this card really makes this control deck fly a lot smoother by making your opponent that much weaker for using their hand, grave, or banished monster effects. I also think that Santa Claws would be a good addition to this list because its effect is activated during your opponent's end phase, which is respondable by Doomking and/or Dragoon.

You can then infinitely fusion summon by banishing cards from your hand, deck, field, or GY, and defeat your opponent with effect damage from Blaze Fenix.  Basically, you stall with cards like Threatening Roar and Battle Fader, while searching out Chain Material and Fusion Gate with cards like Trap Trick and Terraforming. Then, after you have the combo pieces, you set Chain Material and protect it if you can with Timidity until the next turn. Then, you activate both Chain Material and Fusion Gate. Fusion Gate allows you to fusion summon any amount of time per turn, and Chain Material allows you to use material from pretty much anywhere.  After you get this combo, you fusion summon. A lot. I start with a Dark Dragoon or two to stop your opponent from doing anything, then I get 1 Blaze Fenix, use its ability, get the 2nd using the first as material, and then the 3rd the same way. If you haven't killed your opponent yet, get Elemental HERO Electrum, shuffling all banished cards back into the deck, and repeat. If your opponent has something like a D/D/D Oracle King D'arc, then you have to take that out using Dark Dragoon's ability or Volcannon. If your opponent has a Dimension Gardian-ed D/D/D Oracle King D'arc, then I'm sorry but I can't really help you, except by requesting you add some Heavy Storm Dusters or Twin Twisters to the deck.  Anyway, that's pretty much it. I just filled the Side Deck with some nice hand traps, so there isn't really much to say about it.  Oh, actually, forgot about one thing. Raging Flame Sprite is not only good for fusion summoning Blaze Fenix, and can be pretty good by itself if you can stall until it has over 4000 ATK with its own ability."

Until we see some more Marincess Spell Cards, this deck is going to remain non-viable in the mainstream and won't enter the Meta.  Nevertheless, the idea is to push forward with a huge combo play into one of the big Marincess Link Monsters (either Marbled Rock, Wonder Heart, Great Bubble Reef) it actually doesn't matter, they each bring forward their own play style after the main combo. Wonder Heart can act as an extender following turn one, Great Bubble Reef much the same, and Marbled Rock has some great protection on top of the field spell.  Splash Mage can act as an amazing extender either in the middle of the Marciness combo or when you flip for Transcode Talker.  Always use Micro Coder to fetch Cynet Conflict when heading into summoning a Code Talker monster as it can seriously cripple decks like Invoked, Zombie World, Buster Blader, and a lot of others as it not only banishes the card, but prevents your opponent from activating it again that turn. In heavy combo decks this straight just stops their entire turn. Balancer Lord can act as a really good searcher and extender with Cynet Backdoor as you can fetch a smaller Cyberse monster and summon it too thanks to his double summon effect.  A lot of the combo speaks for itself. Going into the following turns after the first, the idea is to head into Shootingcode Talker, use it as material for Transcode, and then bring it right back from the GY with his effect. Set up your arrows correctly and you'll have three very beefy monsters with the ability to attack your opponent enough to destroy them. Protect the field spell at all costs and winning should be easy enough to pull off - beware that due to the excessive Link summoning, this deck can't keep going indefinitely, eventually you'll run out of resources.  Crusadia Arboria is a great way to play Synchro as well, I personally use Stardust Dragon as another layer of protection for both the field spell and anything else I might need. Trishula is also available to stay on top of your opponent's options."

The rules was that 67.5 of the main, side, and extra deck had to be 67.5 of one archtype. For 41 cards that is 27 in the main. In the extra deck, that is about 10-11 cards from one archtype. I was deciding between sky strikers, and raidraptors, but decided raidraptors bcause they can do a lot of broken things, and easily end games.With just Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius, and Raidraptor- Vanishing Lanius, you can end on Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon, D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga on opponents turn, Gagagaga Magician, Cyber Dragon Infinity and The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche. As long as you can get a way to get to Raidraptor- Wise Strix( The link monster), and a level four monster, you can get full combo.  If people have questions, or suggestion please put them in the comment section, and I will try to answer questions asap, and I will listen to suggestions.  At the end of the tournament I was 8-2, where the two loses were when I went first. The first lost against Charmers, my opponent Village of the Spellcaster me, and bounced my cards back to my hand. The second lost against Mayakashi, I was just dumb, and forget about my set Soulshave force until it was too late, and during their turn, they otked me since my lifepoints were very low.  It was a fun tournament, and I would definitely do it again.  &nbsp;"

Also fog blade is searchable of Bardiche and you never need more than one in your hand  - I also cut the Sword as it is unnecessary in the deck  - I cut Beatrice, Dante and one Cherubini.

There is just a splash of tri-brigade in this harpie deck because they do synergize decently. Getting out harpie slash lady and then using tribrigade assualt on your opponents turn lets you bounce a monster back to their hand while getting set up for next turn. A lot of the harpie cards will make it extremely easy to link climb into borrelsword. It is a work in progress just my attempt to make a competitive harpie deck.

Despite a few flaws (S/T and Monster removal, disruptive effects), it has a lot of strengths in it that I've been looking for in a deck for quite some time now. Example: every single Virtual World normal deck monster (with the exeption of Nyannyan) can Special Summon themselves from the hand AND mill a card. The Spells and the Trap have great effects (even if I wish Qinglong's effect was able to be activated on your opponent's turn), with the Trap being a great recycler on the field and and both Spells pulling out great search effects. There were a few issues with consistency I had to fix, but overall this deck is amazing! (Notice: I've been waiting for this archetype to be released in the TCG since I saw it release in the OCG. Also notice: I am biased towards Wyrm- and/or Psychic-based archetypes).</span>  Now onto the part that people actually care about: how to play with this deck. Typically, you want to start with at 1 Virtual World Spell (typically Kauwloon) and at least 1 (but preferably 2) Virtual World monsters. I also know this isnt necessarily gonna happen every time. So, enter the Foolish Spells. With Foolish Burial you'll want to send Shaddoll Beast to the GY for a draw. With Foolish Burial Goods you'll want to mill Qinglong in order to banish it for a search (notice you'll have to discard a card). Then, you use the Virtual World monsters effects (except for Nyannyan, of course) to Special Summon themselves. If you need to mill a monster, mill Nyannyan, since she's the only one with a GY effect. If you mill a Spell, Qinglong. And there's only 1 option for Trap, so don't even ask.  As far as Extra Deck monsters go, I typically go for Kyubi first, because he can revive himself and has a good disruption effect. Next, you'll want an Xyz monster (typically Longlong or Fanfan) so that you can get Zeus out during the 2nd Main Phase if you're going second. If you're going first, aim for Jiujiu (and get him out first so you're material isn't banished) or, if possible, Shaddoll Winda (this would require two Shaddoll monsters and Shaddoll Fusion in your hand for a first-turn summon, though). Or you could get Longlong, since he'll basically oust any future Ash Blossoms and such. If you want to go for Trishula, though, that's fine by me. Especially first turn, that could be pretty devesting. Maybe.  Of course, as far as singular boss monsters go, you have True King of All Calamities, Kyubi and Zeus. If you get all three of these out... uh... I don't want to be facing you.  Hopefully you found this explaination helpful. Feel free to modify and/or comment on this deck (I'm always looking for pointers on deck building). Also, I know there's only 6 hand traps. I just felt that it was more consistant without the Nibirus I had in here previously. And I know I said last time I'd get both a Pendulum Fusion and Insect deck uploaded. That didn't happen, obviously. The Pendulum deck wound up becoming Dogmatika-Shaddoll and I never got around to the Insects. If you want me to do those, let me know in a comment. Thank you!"

It's a fun experiment I did, and I think the deck turned out well.","<span>This deck may seem like something that would never work in a million years- and you’d be partially right. But, the deck has some level of consistency. The deck is mainly for fun, however, and is not designed for any serious competition.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x The Wicked Dreadroot: This is the worst of the Wicked Gods, and thus is only ran at 1.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x The Wicked Avatar: The best Wicked God card, having an amazing effect that blocks your opponent from spells and trap for 4 whole turns. The card has a built in Moon Mirror Shield effect, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x The Wicked Eraser: The second best Wicked God. It has an incredible board wiping effect when it is destroyed, which will primarily be done via its own effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Ahrima, The Wicked Warden: Used primarily to search your Lair Of Darkness from the deck. It also conflicts with the levels of most of your monsters, so it is only ran at 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Lilith, Lady Of Lament: One of the better cards in the deck, and definitely has the best effect. Even if it is negated with Tour Guide From The Underworld, it can still activate the effect, which uses its cost to tribute. If you have Lair Of Darkness, you practically get to tribute an opponent’s monster for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Tour Guide From The Underworld: One of the best Fiend-type supports in the game, especially in this deck, as a majority of the monsters in it are targets for its effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cir, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Good GY effect to special summon a BA monster. (BA = Burning Abyss)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Libic, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: If sent to the GY, it gives you a free special summon from hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Farfa, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Is a bit situational, but its effect can prove somewhat useful, especially for removing problem monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Graff, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Special summons a BA monster from deck if sent to GY, which can activate their effects from the GY if you control non BA monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Scarm, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Adds a level 3 DARK Fiend to hand if sent to GY, but it only occurs during the End Phase, so it is at 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Lair Of Darkness: One of the biggest pieces of this deck. It allows you to tribute opponent’s monsters to activate effects that require tributes, such as Lilith, Lady Of Lament, and your Virus trap cards. It also generates a large number of tokens (potentially), allowing you to use them for your tribute summons.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Allure Of Darkness: Really good draw power for DARK monster oriented decks.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Terraforming: Used to search Lair Of Darkness.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x The Monarchs Stormforth: Used in order to tribute your opponent’s monsters for the summon of your Wicked Gods.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Eradicator Epidemic Virus: A great trap card. You’ll be wanting to tribute your opponent’s monsters with Lair Of Darkness to use this card, however.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Grinning Grave Virus: Good way to remove problem monsters on your opponent’s field, and it blocks your opponent from using monsters that they draw.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence: A staple normal trap card for any deck like this.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Dante, Pilgrim Of The Burning Abyss: Used as a target for Beatrice, Lady Of The Eternal’s floating effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 77 The Seven Sins: Used to rank up from your Number 35 or Number 84.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS- Sky Thunder: What XYZ deck doesn’t use this card? It’s an incredible board wipe effect, and is very easy to summon.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe: Used to rank up from your rank 10 machines. (The names of them are all extremely long and I don’t want to type them out.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 84 Pain Gainer: Used to rank up from Number 35.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 81 Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora: First off, that’s one hell of a name, and secondly, this card is ran as a rank 10 with basic materials. Its protection effect is very useful.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max: Decent burn effect</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 35 Ravenous Tarantula: Good if you have either a major advantage or disadvantage in terms of LP. Its burn effect on special summons is very useful.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Beatrice, Lady Of The Eternal: Extremely good card that is a walking Foolish Burial, which is able to activate your BA monsters’ effects easily.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 48 Shadow Lich: One of my personal favorite cards, it has the ability to summon a token, which gives the card an attack buff and some protection.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 75 Bamboozling Gossip Shadow: Great effect, drawing cards in place of another monster’s effect is very versatile, it’s a shame this card doesn’t see more play.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Dante, Traveler Of The Burning Abyss: Very good card that is required for any BA deck. It allows you to mill 3 cards, which is incredibly useful for either deck thinning or using BA effects.</span>  &nbsp;  Number 49 Fortune Tune: Good level 3 support that recycles itself.  &nbsp;  <span>1x Beat Cop From The Underworld: If this card is summoned with DARK monsters as materials (which it VERY likely will), it gains an extra effect that tributes as cost, gaining some synergy with Lair Of Darkness. Also good for linking off BA monsters to take advantage of their GY effects.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cherubini, Ebon Angel Of The Burning Abyss: Allows you to send a BA to the GY for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Side Deck:</strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Barbar, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: In case you wanted more BA monsters in the deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Farfa, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Scarm, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Malicevorous Fork: Good special summon effect, but it isn’t in the Main Deck because of its level.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Leviair The Sea Dragon: Situational card that is useful against some decks.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 26 Spaceway Octobypass: Good effect to discourage your opponent from attacking.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: Good spot removal.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Foolish Burial: Staple spell that sends a monster to GY, which will likely be a BA.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Upstart Goblin: Yet another incredible staple spell card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Metaverse: Good for searching Lair Of Darkness, but not as useful as Terraforming.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Trap Trick: Used to search your other trap cards.</span>"

I'd be very grateful for any feedback or constructive criticism.</span></strong></p> &nbsp;  <span><strong>Reasons the card(s) are in this deck:</strong></span> <p><span><strong>Monsters</strong></span> <span>Almost all of the effects that reference other cards involve level 2 or lower monster cards.</span> <span>Thus, most of the monster cards are level 2 or lower. They are also all beasts.</span></p> <span><strong>Melffy Puppy/ Catty/ Pony and Fenny</strong> (x3 of each): All great for swarming. It's good to get as many of these on the field as possible, for defence and to use as material for the Xyz monsters. These aren't easy to get rid of since when an enemy special, normal summons, or attacks one of these cards, these cards' effects allow them to be brought back to the hand, and another summoned in its place. They can also be special summoned in your end phase. I included 3 of each to increase chances of successful swarming.</span>  <span><strong>Melffy Rabby</strong> (x3): <span>Also great for swarming, although unlike the other Melffys, Rabby doesn't have any effects. It does, however, have a high defence and will likely stick around on the field longer than the other Melffys. Again, I included 3 to increase chances of successful swarming.</span></span>  <span><strong>Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> (x2): Good for circulating the cards. If you have a card you don't want, and need to get another monster on the field, this is perfect for grabbing one of the lower level monsters. Since it doesn't change things dramatically, I only include 2.</span>  <span><strong>Kalentosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> (x3): A good way to take out some strong monsters. I included 3 in case something with high ATK/DEF needs to be taken out. </span>  <span><b>Uniflora, <strong>Mystical Beast of the Forest </strong></b>(x1): Since all the monsters in this deck are beasts, this effect will always be an option. Don't feel the need for more than one of these.</span>  <span><b>Wrecker Panda </b>(x1): Another level 2 monster to keep things interesting. If you use its effect, <em>Wrecker Panda's</em> ATK/DEF would most likely both raise to 1,200, since most of the cards in this deck are level 2.</span>  <span><b>Bujingi Wolf </b>(x1): Its effect is useful, and I like to have a couple of stronger monsters in the deck, just in case. Just one of these. </span>  <span><b>Rodenut </b>(x1): If you can keep him on the field long enough (Bujingi Wolf's effect would help protect him from battle), this can be good for removing strong enemy monsters, similarly to <em>Kalentosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest</em>. Just one of this card; it's not very strong, so I find it a bit risky.</span>  <span><b>Danger Jackalope </b>(x1): Not sure how often people would use this card in a deck with no other <em>Danger!</em> cards. I like to use the effect of this when I have a lot of cards in my hand, so it's likely it'll be put in the field. Trouble is, if your opponent does pick this card from your hand and <em>Danger!? Jackalope?</em> is discarded, there are no other <em>Danger!</em> monsters in this deck to summon. You might want to switch out one of the Melffy core cards for another <em>Danger!</em> monster. This is how I've been playing this deck so far, but I might update this deck to have another <em>Danger!</em> monster.</span>  <span><b>Rescue Ferret </b>(x1): Allows you to bring back 3 core Melffy cards (or other level 2 or lower monsters) from the graveyard. Only one of this as a last resort. <em>Feel free to correct me on this, but I've included this card based on the assumption the special summoned cards can then be used as material for one of the Xyz monsters before they would be destroyed during the End Phase.</em> </span> <p><span><strong>Spells</strong></span> <span>These ones are mostly about getting monsters on the field, giving them extra attack, and protecting them from being destroyed.</span></p> <span><b>Melffy Hide and Seek </b>(x3): Protects those Melffys (and friends) and gets another beast on the field. Very handy, so 3 of these.</span>  <span><b>Melffy Tag </b>(x3): Just another chance to get another Melffy out of the graveyard and back in action. Once again, 3 of these. The more Melffy's on the field, the better.</span>  <span><b>Melffy Playhouse </b>(x2): If you're in a tight spot, this'll let you send your enemies back home. It'll also power your Xyz monster up! 2 of these should do.</span>  <span><strong>Closed Forest</strong> (x1)</span> <span>Chances are, there will often be a fair few monsters in the graveyard. This'll take advantage of that. The more beasts in the graveyard, the stronger the ones on the field will be. Just 1 of these for that extra boost</span>  <span><strong>Rush Recklessly</strong> (x1)</span> <span><span>While <em>Closed Forest</em> is a potentially small power up for a lot of cards, this is a large power up for 1 specific one. Choose your timing carefully though. Just 1 of these to leave room for other more important cards.</span></span>  <span><b>Obedience Schooled </b>(x1)</span> <span><span>Like <em>Rescue Ferret</em>, this allows you to bring back 3 level 2 or lower monsters. As its effects are more or less the same as <em>Rescue Ferret</em>, I only included 1. <em>Again, feel free to correct me on this, but I've included this card based on the assumption the special summoned cards can then be used as material for one of the Xyz monsters before they would be destroyed during the End Phase.</em></span></span>  <span><b>Spiritual Forest </b>(x1)</span> <span>Protects 1 beast monster from being destroyed each turn (remember, all of the monsters in this deck are beasts). Not as useful as <em>Melffy Hide and Seek</em>, so just 1 of these.</span>  <span><b>Forest </b>(x1)</span> <span>An additional 200 ATK/DEF for all our monsters. Just one for that extra helpful boost.</span>  <span><b>Child's Play </b>(x1)</span> <span>An additional 300 LP for each opponent's special summon? Yes please! Rack up that health! Just one to help out a bit. It'd take a long time to obtain 10,000 life points with this being the only LP based card, so the second effect isn't likely that useful, but the LP you do get is helpful enough. Just one of this card.</span> <p><span><strong>Extra deck/XYZ monsters</strong></span></p> <span><strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> (x3):</span> <span>Try and get those 5 materials on activate all 3 effects. Then increase its ATK with those spell card, and start destroying.</span>  <span><strong>Joyous Melffys</strong> (x2):</span> <span>Honestly, I haven't used this yet. It's the extra deck though, so why not?</span>  <span><strong>Melffy of the Forest</strong> (x2):</span> <span>Umm.. I don't have these cards, so haven't tried them. When I do, I'll probably update this.</span>"

The deck is quite consistent, and is able to end on a board of Borreload Savage Dragon, and Herald Of The Arc Light. I will give my reasonings for playing each card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Megalosmasher X: Used as a Rescue Rabbit target to go into XYZ plays with Evolzar Dolkka and Evolzar Laggia.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Sabersaurus: Ran for the same reasons as Megalosmasher X, but is ran at 2 due to its lower ATK stat.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Angel Trumpeter: Good level for a tuner, but is not the optimal tuner to use.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Galaxy Serpent: Level 2 tuners are the best for this deck, hence why this card is in it. However, it is ran at 2 due to its lackluster stats.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Mystical Shine Ball: Has a good level, and is used as the target for The Agent Of Creation- Venus’ effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Guardragon Justica: Level 2 tuner with a high defense stat, which is why it is ran at 3 rather than Galaxy Serpent.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cosmo Brain: Its summoning condition can lead to GY setup, and its on-field effect lets you get a normal monster for free, at the cost of an effect monster, be it itself or a Tenyi.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Tenyi Spirit- Mapyura: You can substitute this with any level 4 Tenyi, or even Adhara, to be honest, but this is preferred due to its negation effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Rescue Rabbit: One of the best normal monster support cards, this lets you easily summon things like Megalosmasher X and Sabersaurus to the field for XYZ plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x The Agent Of Creation- Venus: One of the best cards in the deck. Having this on field greatly increases the consistency of your combos, letting you summon a level 2 monster for practically free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Draconnet: Used for its effect to bring out on of your tuners for free. Do NOT target Mystical Shine Ball with this card’s effect, and always summon from deck if possible.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Enchanting Fitting Room: This card really has no downside, except for the fact that not excavating a target is a -1, but that’s excusable, as it allows you to summon your tuners for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Faustian Bargain: Good removal that doesn’t destroy, and the special summon is icing on the cake. This can even be used on your own monsters, such as a lingering Linkross, in order to extend combos.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Swing Of Memories: Really good revival spell.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Unexpected Dai: Incredible combo starter, having this card in hand ensures at least a couple of plays, many of which end in at least 2 negates.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Borreload Savage Dragon: A great negation card, you’ll be wanting to use a Crystron Halqifibrax in your GY as the target for this card’s effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi: Incredible effect, having a non-destruction, non-targeting removal effect that banishes. Its Battle Phase effect isn’t as important, but it’s still good to note.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Coral Dragon: Used for its removal effect, and its effect when it leaves the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Brionac, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier: Good bouncing effect, especially when going second. Can easily lead to an OTK.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Ally Of Justice Catastor: Old school, but still has a very good effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Herald Of The Arc Light: Incredible, easy to get out negate/floodgate. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Martial Metal Marcher: Used as a combo piece in order to bring out Herald Of The Arc Light using Linkross’ tokens.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Evolzar Laggia: The better Evolzar, this card functions as a Solemn Judgement, negating almost everything (except for monster effects).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Evolzar Dolkka: While this is slightly worse, it does negate monster effects, which is incredibly useful in its own right.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Daigusto Emeral: Mainly used for its second effect in this deck, allowing for easy revival of a normal monster, whether it be a tuner or not.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Crystron Halqifibrax: A staple card for any modern Synchro deck, this is one of the key pieces to most combos in this deck. Getting a free tuner on board is just that important.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Link Spider: Incredible normal monster support. This allows for numerous combos, and is only limited to a soft once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Monk Of The Tenyi: Used to send your Tenyi(s) to the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Linkross: One of the cards that makes this deck possible. You’ll want to use this after summoning a Crystron Halqifibrax, and summon Martial Metal Marcher, which will then go into Herald Of The Arc Light.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Tune Warrior: Level 3 tuner. Not as useful as level 2 or 4, but has the ability to be usable.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Galaxy Serpent: In case you want more level 2 tuners.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Flamvell Guard: Level 1 tuner; not as useful as levels 2, 3, and 4.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Tenyi Spirit- Shthana: Used to replace Mapyura. This can be substituted for any other Tenyi, except Adhara.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Tenyi Spirit- Adhara: Good tuner with an easy to fulfill summon condition.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Shooting Riser Dragon: Good combo extender, but the level is a bit too difficult to pull off for it to not be in Side Deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Berserker Of The Tenyi: Good beatstick, can be used to Link off unnecessary cards like any leftover Linkross.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Dark Ruler No More: Great going second card, can disrupt many plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Enchanting Fitting Room: In case you wanted another.</span>"

The main goal is to spam the field with as many Yoke as possible and then recycle with Kaiser when needed. Safe Zone keeps Yoke alive and he cant be targeted, but also is a great way to pop an enemy monster if its set and destroyed, by targeting one of your opponents monsters with it. This deck can be a bit slow at times, so that's why you run so many traps. Like the title says, this is budget (other than the Infernoble engine, which is over half the decks whole price), so feel free to swap out for more expensive hand traps. Let me know if you have any thoughts on ways to improve the deck, other than beefing up the hand traps! Thank you!"
