It is designed to spam rank 1 Lyrical Luscinia monsters. You want to get Assembly Nightingale out as soon as possible and with as many XYZ materials as possible.  I have included ways to summon fusion and synchro monsters for diversity/versatility but you'll only use them in the most dire of circumstances. The goal of the deck should be to get your Assembly Nightingale out and then use Recite Starling to boost it/search for other lyrical luscinia monsters  Please feel free to give me criticism and commentary on the deck. It works pretty well(its 23 - 3 in play testing as of right now) but there is definitely room for improvement  strategy here...

After testing I've found it has a low brick rate and is extremely competitive for those meta players who are Trickstar fans! The goal of this deck is to burn your opponent every time they draw/search and every time they use a spell/trap. Also, using the Trickstar Reincarnation and Droll &amp; Lock Bird combo to make your opponent lose their entire hand and basically instant lose is amazingly broken and helpful. It's simple, just get two Trickstar Reincarnations using Trickstar Light Stage and Trickstar Candina, then set them. Make sure you have a Droll &amp; Lock Bird in your hand, then once your opponent plays any card on their following turn right after yours, use one of the set Trickstar Reincarnations and right after it resolves and your opponent draws their new hand, start a new chain by activating the other Trickstar Reincarnation, then immediately chain your Droll &amp; Lock Bird in your hand to that Trickstar Reincarnation. Droll &amp; Lock Bird's effect comes first in the chain, therefore it will stop them from searching/drawing anymore this turn, and the Trickstar Reincarnation will set off next, making them banish their entire hand without being able to draw after since Droll &amp; Lock Bird's effect is active. Scapegoat and Eater of Millions are also very powerful tools in this Trickstar build. Use Scapegoat during your opponents end phase allowing you to link summon big boss monsters like Borreload Dragon and Saryuja Skull Dread during your following turn to OTK and overwhelm your opponent."

You want to go second every duel though if you can, otherwise it is hard to win. To win you need to special summon the Mekk-Knights to OTK your opponent out of nowhere. If you're opponent has one card in a column and you have a spell or trap and a Mekk-Knight in your hand then you should set the spell or trap in the same column as their card(s).Â  Then you can special summon the Mekk-Knight(s) in the column(s) that have two or more cards! Use Mind Control to take their monsters and link them away with your Mekk-Knights/Scapegoat Tokens.Â  Final Countdown puts pressure on them as they have to hurry if they want to win while Final Countdown is active. It's a tech choice I came up with that is funny to use. Use Psychokinesis to destroy your opponent's cards and use Psi-Blocker to block their card(s) that you know they are going to try to use. There are other great cards in the deck that have good synergy with the deck like PSY-Framelord Omega. I came up with these great techs that have good synergy with the deck. Hope you all enjoy them and the deck!"

","This is a fairly straightforward deck that I'm trying out for the sake of one of my favorite monsters; Chaos MAX. Kaijus are a fun and incredibly annoying but still entirely viable mechanic that lends itself well to the lvl 8 draw cards, so they were one of the best ways to fit the engine in. The main objective is to take out problematic monsters then beat over the rest of the board, either with your Kaijus or with the main dragon himself, MAX-y boy. Also, I should mention that the extra deck is really random, I just kinda picked usable cards without a whole lot of forethought, but you could fit a couple generic links, a couple lvl 4 overlays and just generally put a bit more effort into it than I initially did. My only regret is that this deck is actually the 4th version of the concept. The first version employed recurring monsters like Grapha to do the deed instead, but my boys in the Dark World just can't keep up anymore. :(  UPDATED FOR IMPCANTATIONS! I, FOR ONE, WELCOME OUR NEW RITUAL OVERLORDS. These little guys help add consistency and a muuuuuuch easier OTK to the deck;  - Summon an Impy-boi in defense position - Creature Swap the Impy-boi away - Summon Chaos MAX - Attack for game  It's freaking hilarious when it goes off."

On their own, they can give you a steady start to a game, providing a solid defensive line. With the assistance of Dragon Horn Hunter, these monsters become just that little bit stronger and also protect you from battle damage entirely.  Use cards like Heat Wave or Tyrant's Throes to gain a huge advantage over your opponents (Provided they aren't playing a similar deck) by cutting off their most powerful monsters and allowing you to build up field presence in the meantime, picking off their tributes and other weaker monsters. If Sea Dragoons of Draconia is in the Pendulum zone, attacking your opponent will also enable you to get an extra monster out each turn during the Battle Phase. Depending on the opponent, Tyrant's Throes can almost become a win condition for this deck, stifling your opponent's summoning capacity completely while leaving yours untouched and allowing you to attack directly every turn.  Sky Dragoons of Draconia has a powerful Pendulum effect that allows you to double up on monster destruction each time you attack with one of your Normal monsters, useful for disposing of high-ATK targets, or to eliminate threats in your opponent's Spell &amp; Trap card zones. Alternatively, you can use it to clear out a Pendulum zone you no longer need to replace it for a new one.  Summoner's Art can be used to search out Dragon Horn Hunter or Sky Dragoons of Draconia to start off your Pendulum setup, or in tandem with Ancient Rules to bring out a Blue Eyes White Dragon or Dragon Core Hexer. <h3>Extra Deck</h3> One of the easiest possible strategies to pull off with this deck is to use Dragon's Mirror and Link Spider to summon First of the Dragons. Summon any Normal monster while you have another Level 4 or lower in hand, then Link summon Link Spider. Use its effect to bring out the second monster, and then use Dragon's Mirror to banish the one in the Graveyard and the one on the field as Fusion materials.  Princess Cologne can be used as an easy barricade if you come under pressure from attacks. Combined with Dragon Horn Hunter's Pendulum effect, she can usually buy you at least one turn to recover. <h3>Alterations</h3> <ul>  	<li>Dragon Core Hexer is mostly in this deck as a thematic compliment to Dragon Horn Hunter. Mechanically, she isn't much better than Blue Eyes unless you want to use her as a defensive wall. She could easily be traded out for a third Blue Eyes or similar monster.</li>  	<li>Alternate Pendulum choices may include Lancephorhynchus to give all your Normal monsters piercing damage, or Master Pendulum, The Dracoslayer to help manage your Pendulum zones.</li> </ul>"

Silent swordsman unique ability to negate Spells at lv.5 and all Spells and Traps at Lv.7 is extremely powerful combining it with the warrior synergy you're going to be cooking up some decently sized plays with this deck. I suggest trying to either get<strong> Silent Swordsman</strong> or <strong>Silent Swordsman Lv.3</strong> on the board on turn 1 it is extremly powerfu.l if you can keep <strong>Silent Swordsman</strong> you can use his ability to not only negate spells but also Buff him every standby phase  -If there is any tips or suggestions let me know  -Blason

This deck is pretty consistent for the FTK and you can expect to FTK your opponent maybe once every match and even if you can't, then just use regular Pendulum Magician combos and set up Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon! The FTK is not too hard, I will explain the easiest way to do it, right now. First, you need to link summon one Heavymetalfoes Electrum by using Astrograph Sorcerer and/or Cronograph Sorcerer and/or Supreme King Darkwurm to special summon and/or you can normal summon too to get the Electrum. After that you need to get five dark pendulum monsters on the field (six monsters total including the Electrum in the extra monster zone) by pendulum summoning. Then make a second Heavymetalfoes Electrum. Also, you MUST have Instant Fusion in your hand to bring out the FTK fusion target (Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale).Â  You can place Supreme King Gate Zero and Supreme King Gate Infinity in your scales and use Gate Zero's effect to search an Instant Fusion if you don't have it in hand already. But don't use the Instant Fusion until the end! Make sure to use both Electrum's effects in the process of summoning them to special summon Astrograph and/or Cronograph and get a free draw.Â  Next, link those Electrums away to get Zefra Metaltron. Then, contact fuse the four left over dark pendulum monsters to get out two Supreme King Dragon Starving Venoms and use Instant Fusion to get out Lyrilusc.Â  Finally, copy Lyrilusc's effect using the Supreme King Dragon Starving Venoms and use both Starving Venom's effects to deal burn damage to them worth eight-thousand life points! This is the easiest way to FTK your opponent using this deck, but there are other plays in this deck to get the Instant Fusion to bring out Lyrilusc and use the Supreme King Starving Venoms to burn them for game. If you manage to figure out the other ways you can truly master this deck and FTK your opponent every game if you go first and they don't have any handtraps! I will list the steps below :  <strong>Steps To FTK Your Opponent Using Dark Pendulum Monsters:</strong> <ol>  	<li>Make sure you have an Instant Fusion in your hand</li>  	<li>Link summon 2 Heavymetalfoes Electrums while having 4 dark pendulum monsters on the field via pendulum summon</li>  	<li>Use those Electrums to link summon Zefra Metaltron</li>  	<li>Contact fuse for 2 Supreme King Starving Venoms</li>  	<li>Use the Instant Fusion to bring out Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale</li>  	<li>Copy Lyrilusc's effect using the 2 Supreme King Dragon Starving Venoms</li>  	<li>Use both of the Starving Venoms effects to burn your opponent for 8k!</li> </ol> Thanks For Checking Out My Deck Profile And FTK Tutorial!  - MindReader"

Millenium-Eyes - ""Relinquished Fusion"" can Fuse Relinquished win ANY monster in your Hand/Field. He can stop a lot of annoying monsters effects.  Dystopia - Probably the Most Awkward to summon but Not Difficult. ""Oh Tokenbaum"" can tribute one token and summon the 4 Kuriboh monsters from your Graveyard to Summon. Best in Mid to Late game. plus he sends the Kuribohs back to grave so it wont affect your ability to summon Envoy  While Linkuriboh is a must i am not too familiar with Link monsters so you may find better options than the ones i picked.  Hope u guys Enjoy ^_^"

Combo them with their unique Fog counter abilities and the mighty Sea Lords Amulet to make them truly ,<em>Core Strategy</em>:Â  Use Cloudians to make immortal units on the board the ideal start is to have <strong>Spirit barrier</strong> to remove all damage you'll be taking. Use the Cloudians abilities to apply Fog Counters to the board and summon the mighty <strong>Nimbusman</strong> or <strong>Eye of the TyphoonÂ </strong>to make large board presence. Using <strong>Sea Lord's Amulet</strong> to make these indestructible units immmune to all card effect making them truly immortal.  -Like before please give and tips or advice i feel like this deck is rather good in the long run but it is still a work in progress.  -Blason
