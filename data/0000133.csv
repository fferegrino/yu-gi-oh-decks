So main points
<ol>
 	<li>Lock down</li>
 	<li>Hand Rip</li>
</ol>
This deck is very good at both

Weakness
<ol>
 	<li>Hand traps that prevents cat/summoner/Ferret from playing off</li>
 	<li>prevent from using the graveyard</li>
</ol>
So if you read some of my earlier versions you will note that the main tactics is really simple

&nbsp;

Faultroll and Rag is life for hand rip

You want a ferret on the draw four from the dread and a reborn

You might note I don't have as many gy reborn cards than the last time. They clogged to much and you still draw into them now without issue. I've added more draw cards to give a shot at drawing them as well."

<span><span>So your boss card in this deck is </span><span><a data-name=""Drytron Meteonis Draconids"">Drytron Meteonis Draconids</a> which has 4000 atk and has up to two pop’s on your opponent's turn. The best nekroz card is probably <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a> which has the effect of trishula on Ritual Summon. </span></span>

&nbsp;

<span>The deck strategy. dytron/nekroz</span>

<span>You play the dytron monster like you would Impcantations you spam them out and use them to ritual summon. In my opinion, they are way better than Impcantations they can search way more giving them consistently and they can use their effect in the gy. What you try to do when you play nekroz going second is one go second and two respond to your opponent's board by wiping it out on your turn or there with <a data-name=""Drytron Meteonis Draconids"">Drytron Meteonis Draconids</a> or <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>. You can also play defensive with <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> or use <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> against link heavy decks. (attach it to another up arrow link.) Maybe just swing on them with <a data-name=""Drytron Meteonis Draconids"">Drytron Meteonis Draconids</a> after summoning <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a>.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Side deck </span>

<span>The side deck is about responding to your opponent's deck. Too many dark monsters on their field <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>. Too many spells traps <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> and <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>. You know you're going second go with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>. Last <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> if their end boards are two big.

It's pretty similar to my previous deck posted here, primarily made for going second, however cards in the side deck maximise winning potential. The strategy is plain and simple, going second: break the opponent's board and swing for the KO. Going first: stun and set up a board wipe or lock the opponent out of summoning, before going in for the KO in turn 3.

<strong>Monsters:</strong>

Cyber Dragons:

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a> - Run at three for the benefit of <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a>, which remains the deck's win condition. Seeing this in the opening hand when going second isn't an issue given it's effect, however it can brick if going first and you have no other cards to assist in bringing it out.

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a> - The deck's main starter and MVP, ran at three. When summoned, this will, if uninterrupted by your opponent, will add 1 ""Cyber"" spell/trap to your hand. This card's secondary effect (activated in the GY) can also help reconstruct your board if your opponent has cleared your side of the field monsters, by bringing a Cyber Dragon monster from your deck to your hand at the cost of banishing Core from the Graveyard. Target #1 for Machine Duplication.

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> - Again, ran at three as this is a Machine Duplication target. Both effects are useful, although you are far more likely to get mileage out of Herz mid-game when special summoned for Rank 5 XYZ plays. This card also synergises well with <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a>, given Galaxy Soldier's special summoning condition of discarding a light monster, this card brings a ""Cyber Dragon"" to the hand to facilitate the special summon of the second Galaxy solider - instant XYZ summon into <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>.

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nachster"">Cyber Dragon Nachster</a> - Ran at two, as this is the only Machine Duplication target that can brick on turn 1; without another monster (preferably a Cyber Dragon) or Machine Duplication in hand, this is as good as useless. This card really shines when your GY is filled with Machine monsters with the magical 2100 ATK or DEF value, however be wary that once activated you can no longer special summon non-Machine monsters for the remainder of the turn.

<a data-name=""Cyber Eltanin"">Cyber Eltanin</a> - Board wipe, ""sends"" rather than destroys monsters and does not target, which is incredibly useful for dealing with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. Searchable, used as an alternative and counter to the Red-Eyes package.

Other monsters:

<a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> - A Cyber Dragon in all but name. This is the go-to card to make <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> as it leaves your ordinary Cyber Dragons available for other uses. Synergises with <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> very well and is searchable through Cyber Repair Plant. In addition, if you have already summoned <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> and these remain floating in your deck (a brick waiting to be drawn), these are ideal cards to discard to grant Rampage the additional attacks. Ran at two, as three increases the likelihood that multiples could be drawn and bricking on turn 1.

<a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a> - Ideal for removing a troublesome opposing monster and is easily removable thanks to <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon (a good rule would be to run one Fortress for every Jizukiru in the Main deck)</a>. Searchable through <a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a>. Ran at one, however this is a very good candidate to increase to two.

<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> - Fantastic card to provide an easy bit of spot removal.

Handtraps:

<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Currently, I'm only running </a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">,</a> increased from two to three, as it's by far the most effective handtrap in the game.

I also considered the <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package, however I've found that with the other spells/traps/handtraps included in the deck, it's a bit overkill and can make the deck even more bricky.

<strong>Spells:</strong>

<a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a> - The ROTA of the deck, with built in protection at the cost of a discard. Ran at three.

<a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a> - An extender that relies on you having at least one ""Cyber Dragon"" in the GY. Searches the majority of the monsters in the Main Deck, however is a hard once per turn and given the prerequisite, I wouldn't advise increasing to three copies.

<a data-name=""Cyber Revsystem"">Cyber Revsystem</a> - Another useful extender; <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> for ""Cyber Dragon"" with the bonus option of allowing you to special summon a Cyber Dragon from the hand. Not particularly useful for your Extra Deck Monsters (barring <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>), however you have Nachster to bring them back from the GY. Could increase to two, however I prefer having a copy of Monster Reborn.

<a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> - Your win condition. Target one ""Cyber Dragon"" with less than 500 ATK, special summons two Cyber Dragons from the deck. If this resolves, it's usually game over. Having this at three does make the deck very bricky, however given the risk/reward involved, the benefit outweighs the cost.

<a data-name=""Overload Fusion"">Overload Fusion</a> - Facilitates your OTK. Ran at one because having multiples in hand at the cost of an extender is not fun and Verte Anaconda provides an easily available search. The only target is <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a>, however it's the only one you really need.

<a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a> - Quick play fusion card that also can facilitate an OTK, for the purpose of bringing out <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> or Rampage. In terms of using it, this is best activated during the battle phase, after all other monsters have attacked, bring out <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> for 5600 points of damage (better still when this is combined with Sieger).

<a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> - Going second staple, Harpie's Feather Duster + Raigeki. Budget alternatives: <a data-name=""Dark Hole"">Dark Hole</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>

<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> - Going second, helps break boards by nullifying monster effects.

<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> - Staple for seeding the GY and activating Repair Plant.

<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> - Useful as an extender and to bring back boss monsters in a pinch.

<strong>Traps:</strong>

<a data-name=""Cybernetic Overflow"">Cybernetic Overflow</a> - Great card. Maximum 3 cards popped on your opponent's side of the field and if destroyed by card-effect, you can search another ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from your deck. I've added the second copy which is usually sided out into the main. Banishes Cyber Dragons to set up for Cyberload Fusion.

<a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> - Wins you games!

<strong>Extra Deck:</strong>

<a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> - Useful to dispose of your Kaiju, and wiping the field clean in mirror matches or anything that uses a Machine type.

<a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a> - Snatches opponent's monsters out of the Extra Monster Zone, what's not to love?

<a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> - Insanely powerful card. Has the potential to act as a Harpie's Feather Duster (depending on the number of monsters used for its Fusion Summon) and can attack three times. Ran at two as space is an issue in the Extra Deck.

<a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> - More potent than <a data-name=""Cyber End Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a>, hands down. This card is a game winner if brought out with <a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a> during the battle phase.

Cyber Eternity Dragon - Generic Cyberload Fusion Target, 4000 DEF, if there's a Fusion monster in the GY it can't be targeted or be destroyed by card effect.

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> - Ran at two, for safety, as everyone hates it when the smashy rock comes down!

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> - Best card to bring out when forced to go first (paired with Cybernetic Overflow). Can suck up an opposing monster and provides a negate.

<a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> - One of the best XYZ themed cards in the Meta, synergises well with Infinity and Nova.

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a> - Built in Limiter Removal, best used in conjunction with Chimeratech Rampage Dragon

<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> - Searches Overload Fusion and Cyberload Fusion!

<a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> - Turns on Cyber Repair Plant and provides protection for Extra Deck Monsters

<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> - Similarly to Almiraj, turns on Repair Plant, but is exclusively for Herz and Nachster

<a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> - Makes an opponent pay for zone deployment mistakes and easily accessible via Herz and Nachster.

<strong>Side Deck</strong>:

<a data-name=""Heat Wave"">Heat Wave</a> - Cyber Dragon hates going first, however this card shuts down most decks by stopping Effect Monsters from being summoned until your next draw phase, giving you an opportunity to OTK on turn 3

<a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> - A particularly nasty way of clearing the opponent's board. It might stop you from OTKing on Turn 2, but it's definitely worth running at three! <span>Moved from the Main Deck to the side as I'm using Lightning Storm in the Main Deck.</span>

<span><a data-name=""Appointer of the Red Lotus"">Appointer of the Red Lotus</a> - Self explanatory, removing an opponent's starters, extenders or combo pieces from their hand can ruin their day!</span>

<a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> - Generic stun, a potential alternative is <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning. Sided in going first.</a>

<a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> - A gut punch of a card that I'm so glad is making a bit of a comeback. Sided in going first.

<strong>Other cards to consider:</strong>

<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Vier"">Cyber Dragon Vier</a> - Suprisingly useful link-fodder and a helpful chain-blocker for Cyber Dragon Core. I've heard of people running this at more than one for these reasons, however if this was the sole monster in my hand on Turn 1, I'd be very disappointed. Given that this is also <em>not</em> a Machine Duplication target, I would not advise having more than two in the deck. <span>Removed from the Main Deck as whilst it's nice to have, using the slot over other cards wasn't justifiable.</span>

<a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> - Easily accessible beatstick in the mid-late game, 3000 ATK is not to be sniffed at. The banishing summoning condition synergises with the deck very well and comes with a built in Monster Reborn-effect for additional link-fodder. As it is 8 stars, this also can be used as material for the XYZ summon of <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star (if played)</a>. This card can brick and therefore is ran at one. If you are not running Dingirsu, I would suggest replacing this with another copy of <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>. <span>I've removed this from the Main Deck as whilst Dingirsu is great, I wasn't seeing it often enough to justify a spot.</span>

<a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a> - Provides a negate where your cards would be destroyed and can pop an opponent's card upon its Special Summon. <span>As above.</span>

<a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> - Potential 3200 ATK and provides four negates, a budget alternative would be <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>. <span>Removed for Extra Deck Space.</span>

<a data-name=""Different Dimension Ground"">Different Dimension Ground</a> - For mirror matches and to really mess with decks that rely on the GY. <span>Whilst useful, this wasn't seeing enough play and was cut.</span>

<a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> - Would have been included, however it's not been having the best showing recently, but it could make a return in the future."

<span>Approximately 100$ us for every card. </span>

<span>MAIN MONSTER</span>

&nbsp;

<span><span>For our first monster,</span><span> we have <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Starfire"">Magical Musketeer Starfire</a> one of the best magical musketeer monsters that lets you play a Magical Musket card from your hand like all the ones in this deck and an sp from the deck if you play it in her column. Next, we have what I think is the best main deck Magical Musketeer monster <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Caspar"">Magical Musketeer Caspar</a> lets you play a magical musket card from your hand (going to stop saying this because they all say this) and his column effect is </span><span>You can add 1 ""Magical Musket"" card from your Deck to your hand, but not a card with the same name as that activated card </span><span>great for keeping cards in your hand. Next, we got draw power </span><span><a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Kidbrave"">Magical Musketeer Kidbrave</a> column effect to discard a Magical Musket card draw 2 cards nice plus one. </span><span>Second </span><span>last on the list we have <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Doc"">Magical Musketeer Doc </a>column effect brings a magical musket card from your gy to your hand but not the one you played this is good for bringing back your best card like <a data-name=""Magical Musket - Cross-Domination"">Magical Musket - Cross-Domination</a>. Last and least <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Calamity"">Magical Musketeer Calamity</a> column effect sp a Magical Musket card from your gy .   </span></span>

&nbsp;

<span>For the Kaiju engine, we have 3 <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a> which can destroy your opponent's powerful monsters and has the smallest atk of the Kaijus at 2200. The last Kaijus we have is <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a> with a powerful atk of 3300 which you would like to summon on your side of the field to finish the game.  The last main monster we have is <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> which is a great stun card.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>MAIN SPELLS </span>

<span>First for the spells we have <a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a> a great card to destroy all your opponent's monsters and get <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>, to your field. </span>

<span>Now for the best Magical Musket card <a data-name=""Magical Musket - Cross-Domination"">Magical Musket - Cross-Domination</a> it negates effect at turns atk to 0. Last for spells we have <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> just a simple draw card. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Main traps. </span>

<span>First up for traps we have <a data-name=""Magical Musket - Desperado"">Magical Musket - Desperado</a> a simple and good magical musket card. It just a destroyed face-up card on the field but your opponent will not see it coming if you play it from your hand. Number two for the traps we got </span>
<h4><span><a data-name=""Magical Musket - Crooked Crown"">Magical Musket - Crooked Crown</a> it sp a Magical Musketeer card from your hand and takes away a monster zone from your opponent for the turn. Second, to last for the traps we have <a data-name=""Magical Musket - Last Stand"">Magical Musket - Last Stand</a> which is a spell trap negate. For the last card in the main deck, we have <a data-name=""Magical Musket - Dancing Needle"">Magical Musket - Dancing Needle</a> which can banish 3 cards from any player's gy which is great because almost everyone is using gy effects. </span></h4>
&nbsp;

<span>EXTRA DECK</span>

&nbsp;

<span><span>Ok, let’s start off with the boss card </span><span><a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a> he is the key to this deck he generates your resources so you can keep negating your opponent and win the long game. Next in line, it’s <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> and <a data-name=""Secure Gardna"">Secure Gardna</a> just in case anything happens and you need to protect yourself. For a win condition, we have <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> he can finish off games with powerful atks and his powerful effect. For another powerful link for I put in <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a> a strong link 4 that can destroy your opponent's field. For XYZ we have <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>, </span></span>
<h4><span><span><a data-name=""Number C39: Utopia Ray"">Number C39: Utopia Ray</a>, <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a> go into utopia then ray last go into lightning for two 5000 atk swings. You could also use <a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a> with <a data-name=""Double or Nothing!"">Double or Nothing!</a>. The last cand in the extra deck is <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a>, a good negate card for your extra lv 3 monsters. (going into your extra deck aside from </span><span><a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a> is not always the best idea.) </span></span></h4>
&nbsp;

<span>SIDE DECK </span>

<span><span>Starting now with your side deck we have </span><span><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, a powerful card with lots of the meta banishing as cost Eldlich dino Virtual World. Next up <a data-name=""Gnomaterial"">Gnomaterial</a>, this card is very useful against link climb decks. For anti draw power, we have <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> feel tired of your opponent searching and drawing out so many cards now they can only do one with this powerful card. For the second last monster, we have an extra <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>. For a powerful going second card, it’s <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, a free sp, and pop. For spell trap removal  I put in <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>. For the only trap and last card, it’s <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> a powerful crap negate card making it so your opponent can not activate traps for the rest of the turn. </span></span>

&nbsp;

<span>Deck strategy. </span>

<span> The strategy of this deck is to build up your board slowly while you stop your opponent from making theirs with spells and traps. This deck likes going second because you can break your opponent's board with kujus and use <a data-name=""Magical Musketeer Max"">Magical Musketeer Max</a> to get you more spells/traps. Hopeful then your opponent has used lots of their resources already and 2-3 stuns will leave them helpless. This deck can force a slow game really easily with the kujus but if that doesn't work you have a side deck full of choices that can slow your opponent down and get you the win.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Decks to watch out for. (top control decks.)</span>

<span>Powerful control decks like Eldlich will outdo you with trap cards that bring more after they're used you just can not keep control of the battlefield.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span> </span>

&nbsp;

<span><span>Right here we have a different deck variation without the </span><span>Kaiju and a deck full of good side deck picks. (enjoy)</span></span>

Secret village will either shut your Opp. from using spells that turn (unless Eldlich) or force them to NS a spellcaster to which you can then use Haine's quick effect to pop said Spellcaster thus rendering them unable to use spells UNLESS they can react with a quick play spell. One way to get around this is setting WC Unveiling and immediately using it on your Opp.'s turn to SS any withcrafter from your hand, and with <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Witchcrafter_Unveiling"">Unveiling's</a> effect being used that turn, your Opp. can no longer react to Haine's pop effect since WC Unveiling states ""Special Summon 1 ""Witchcrafter"" monster from your hand, and if you do, your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of your Spellcaster monster effects for the rest of this turn"".  Magicians' souls can help by being relatively easy to SS along with having draw power, or you can side in Jester Confit if you aren't comfortable sending a lvl 6 or higher Spellcaster to GY while also sacrificing ability to draw, but Souls is preferred since it can help send the WC traps to GY for their banish effects. In the event you are without a Spellcaster on field, WC Genni can help alleviate your spell restriction by banishing her along with a WC Spell that can help you get a Witchcrafter out. Don't like banishing? Well don't worry cause WC Patronus will help you bring back ANY Spellcaster Banished or in GY to your Deck or Extra Deck while also bringing a WC spell to your hand, which can definitely help against flood gates like Dimensional Fissure, but be warned because Extra Deck Spellcasters that were bainshed by Pot of Extravagance cannot be retrieved due to them being face-down.

Extra deck:
<ul>
 	<li>Magistus Artemis is only in here to easily send a  minor Witchcrafter to GY if you don't need to use their Field eff, but their GY eff is needed.</li>
 	<li>Relinquished Anima can help clear your Opp.s' field but is reliant on having a Monster infront of the Extra Mon. space.</li>
 	<li>Akashic can help bounce cards and can co-link with Magistus Artemis or Anima to mill one card from your deck.</li>
 	<li>Day-break is mostly here just because he's a spellcaster, but he can help clear field as well if you can SS a Spellcaster to his zones.</li>
 	<li>Selene is a little hard to get since this deck, and Witchcrafters in general, struggle with Monster Flooding. She was added because shes a spellcaster and can help retrieve them from GY, but again she's a little hard to bring out and she's only useful if there are spells on the field and GY which might be rare due to Secret Village and maybe Genni's banish effect</li>
 	<li>RE dragoon can be sided but I avoid it due to you adding 2-3 possible dead cards in your hand/deck.</li>
</ul>
Ideal turn 1 field (IMO):
<ul>
 	<li>SecretVillage</li>
 	<li>WC Haine for pops</li>
 	<li>WC Bystreet to protect Haine (WC Schmietta can send this to GY with her banish eff if she was Trib. to SS Haine)</li>
 	<li>WC Patronus (To retrieve the WC used to SS Haine and bring discard ammo) or WC Unveiling (Dependent on having a WC in your hand but allows for ""Spell Speed 4"" Haine)</li>
 	<li>(Optional) WC Verre for negs (Only possible really if she's in hand along with Unveiling)</li>
</ul>
Sorry if this was messy to read, I made it round 2am lmao, and if you have any additional questions on this deck or Witchcrafter effect combos or critiques, feel free to reach out :). Hope you enjoy the deck, and have fun using it. Konami more Witchcrafter support please"

<strong>The Main Core of this deck is Raiden, Lumina, Solar Recharge, Charge of Light Brigade, and Chaos Searcher. Everything else can get searched out through milling or by effects of Charge/Chaos Searcher or Omni when summoned. </strong>

Ideally to start out your play you want <strong>Raiden</strong> in your GY<em> (or another <strong>Lightsworn</strong>)</em>, <strong>Lumina</strong> on hand, 1 random card to discard <em>(<strong>Raiden</strong> if he isn't in Grave)</em>. You take out <strong>Raiden</strong>, mill 2, and synchro into <strong>Michael</strong> or <strong>F.A. Dawn</strong>. But if you can special summon another level 4, either synchro into <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> or XYZ <strong>Minerva</strong> as a starting play.

<strong>Chaos Space</strong> helps a lot getting rid of dead <strong><em>Chaos Monsters</em></strong> or <strong><em>Wulf/Felis</em></strong> on your hand and get another Chaos monster into your hand that can't be a normal summon. I would suggest going for <strong>Chaos Valkyra</strong>, or <strong>Black Dragon/White Dragon</strong> depending on what you are discarding. <em>If you <strong>banish one light or dark monster</strong> that <strong>can't be normal summon</strong> from your grave while<strong> Chaos Space is in Grave</strong>, you can <strong>banish Chaos Space</strong> shuffle that monster back into your deck, and draw 1 card.</em> This way you can recycle certain Lightsworns (<strong>Wulf/Felis</strong>), <strong>JD</strong>, or <strong>your chaos monsters</strong>. <strong>Chaos Valkyra</strong> is an absolutely amazing card in this deck, it can be special summoned easily, and when she is banished, she works like a <strong><em>Foolish Burial</em></strong> but <em>it will negate its effects for the rest of the turn</em>. However, if you need a certain monster in the grave, she is still good!

You don't need to run multiple copies of <strong>JD</strong> anymore, 1 is good enough. The majority of the time you don't need <strong>JD</strong> around to win games but having <strong>JD</strong> is helpful. <em>I won many games without <strong>JD</strong> and even side <strong>JD</strong> out</em>. Your extra deck and your other boss monsters can win you games. Take full advantage of <strong>Trisula</strong> (both versions of the LVL 9 and the upcoming level 11 version) because it will help you clear the field by banishing problem cards and do some hand control on your opponent.
<blockquote><div>One of the biggest problems with this deck is drawing into <strong>Wulf, Felis, </strong>or <strong>Chaos monsters</strong> while you have nothing in your GY or ways to get rid of them. It does happen but it is something Lightsworn players pray it won't happen, ideally, you want something to normal to summon at least like <strong>Raiden</strong> (especially), <strong>Lumina</strong>, <strong>Lyla</strong>, <strong>Twilightsworns </strong>or <em>anything that can be Normal Summoned</em> as a worst-case scenario.</div></blockquote>
The main reason why I decided to main <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> instead of<strong> Effect Veiler</strong> or <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> is that you want to be able to take out problematic cards early on instead of just negating it so your opponent either has to waste resources or couldn't do certain combo plays or they still have the problematic card still around to use in their turn. <em>For example, if someone has out <strong>True King of All Calamities</strong>, out on the field, you still have to waste resources to get rid of a 3k beatstick if you didn't draw good/screwed up in your combo plays</em>. Also, it is an LVL 3 light tuner that can be used for XYZ or Synchro plays or used for banishing for light materials in the grave/used for discard for <strong>Chaos Searcher</strong>.

<strong>Omni Dragon Brotaur</strong> is such a helpful card, even though it is LVL 1, you can easily have link monsters that require LVL 1 monster as material in extra, or used for other Synchro/Link plays. <strong><em>It can Special Summon itself from the grave</em></strong>, help you get rid of dead cards from hand, and get out a search for a dragon type or a different type of monster on the field to hand.

<em><strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer </strong>and <strong>Chaos Emperor</strong> are fine running at one. However, I do recommend running multiple <strong>Chaos Creators</strong> because there is a lot of plays and combos you can do with it.</em>

<em><strong>Twilightsworn Lumina, Lyla,</strong> and <strong>Ryko</strong> are the three best <strong>Twilightsworns</strong></em>, they are also darks that can be banished for Chaos summons and search targets for <strong>Charge of The Light Brigade</strong>. I run 1 <strong>Lyla </strong>and 1 <strong>Twilightsworn Lyla </strong>because they are okay normal summons if you don't have anything else, pop a backrow for those decks that do run and help with mills. I tun 1 <strong>Twilightsworn Ryko </strong>because it helps to get rid of problematic cards on-field by banishing. I run 2 <strong>Twilightsworn Lumina </strong>because you will banish a lot, or your opponent will banish one of your L<strong>ightsworns,</strong> and she one of your few ways to retrieve them back.

For Extra Deck,

You only need 1 <strong>Minerva</strong>, I hardly go into her after starting plays. She an amazing at 1st and 2nd turn (if she survives) and a field nuke when need to crash into problematic monsters on the field <em>(usually most duel goes up to 5 turns before it is game over if no 1st turn OTKs)</em>. You can easily recycle her if you need it with <strong>Chaos Space</strong> or <strong>Chaos Creator</strong> <em>(she won't have material but if you need to crash and need the mills)</em>. If you are going turn 1, I would also suggest going for <strong>F.A. Dawn</strong> 1st if you can because negativing spells/traps are more important, you should go for <strong>Michael</strong> to get rid of problematic monsters or cards on the field. <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> does 2 things for you, mill and get whatever monster you need to your hand. <strong>PSY-Framelord</strong> is the best troll in the deck and helps recycle cards when needed. LVL 9 <strong>Trishula</strong> and LVL 11 one (coming out with the Ice Barrier Structure deck) are some of the best Synchros to go into. LVL 11 <strong>Trishula</strong> has a floating effect that <em>gets out <strong>Trishula LVL 9</strong> (though effects are negated it comes out as a 3300 beatstick), Skill Drains your opponent monsters currently on the field and cuts their atk in half when it destroyed.</em>

<strong>Number 38</strong> is something you would easily go into a lot, as you aren't main-ing key backrow removers like <strong>MST/Twister</strong> you want to be able to <strong>negative a spell/trap</strong> here and there, and also it protects your weaker monsters when needed. <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> is a <strong>meta call.</strong> You can run <strong>Leviair</strong> because you are going to banish a lot of monsters on both your side and your opponents. But the main reason why I decided to not run it because <strong>Chaos Creator </strong>a better <strong>Leviair</strong><strong> </strong>and I decided to tech-in <strong>I:P Maskerena.</strong>

<strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong> help with getting rid of backrow and <strong>Unicorn</strong> can help with getting rid of backrow or monsters by shuffling them back into the deck, they are stable Link with little explaining needed. <strong>Curious</strong> is an okay Link monster to get out, gives you a mill, a foolish but most importantly, <em><strong>you can get any card from your grave to your hand if your opponent destroys it</strong></em>. <strong>Saryuja</strong> and <strong>Bow of the Goddess</strong> are necessary Link-4s to have. <strong>I:P Maskerena </strong>is a good turn on if you need to go into <strong>Knightmares </strong>or <strong>Bow of the Goddess </strong>during your opponent's turn as a way to disturb their plays.

Side Deck;

Your side deck should be against whatever the current meta/or stuff your opponents can side against you or you know they have certain cards that can ruin your plays such as <strong>Macro/Skill Drain</strong> etc. But at the same time, you want to make your opponent's back row hates be dead as possible a the majority of cards I am running in my side deck are almost all hand traps. Except 2, Called by the Grave and Harpie's Feather Duster. Although I also suggest looking into <em><strong>D.D. Crows, Prohibition, Goddess Skuld's Oracle, Twister/MST, Lost Wind (you can activate from the grave), Breakthrough Skill (you can activate from the grave), and Phantom Knights' Fog Blade.</strong></em>"

Any critiques leave them in the comments

<strong>Thank You</strong>

so what you need for the combo is one Simoon and one level four BlackWing but it could also be Gale

Normal Simoon, banish the other BlackWing for example Bora. Get a Whirlwind and search Auster Triggering Auster effect to summon the bora from the banish zone to the field triggering whirl to search Harmattan special that, use Harmattan and Simoon for Wise Trix using its effect to summon Zephyros from deck. Use Zephyros and any level four besides from Auster on the field to summon Force Strix detach Zephyros and search any level four special summon from deck and summon it triggering Wise Trix searching soul shave from the deck. Use Zephyros effect in grave send whirl back to hand to summon itself. Using Force Trix and Wise to summon Bardiche. Now using the 2 level fours besides from Auster on the field summon another Force Trix use its effect to get any level 4 special summon now using that special summon and the Auster to summon Borreload Savage (or invader into rebellion) then use Bardiche send boots to the grave searching phantom knight's rank up magic force. Use boots effect in the grave to get a fogblade.

Now at you opponents turn active phantom knight rank up to banish everything besides the Force Strix to summon Ultimate falcon and when it is your turn use soul to summon cyber dragon infinity and win the game

However Scrap Dragon Turbo has never really been the meta so don't expect to compete on national levels with this deck profile, especially since it literally dies to any form of disruption. The strategy is to get out Scrap Dragon or Twin Dragon and recycle Scrap Chimera back to the hand using anothe Scrap's effect so you can easily replace the Dragon in case he dies. Atomic is only in here for being the ""biggest"" Scrap Dragon despite arguably being the worst if we are trying to break through a field. However he can easily mess with GY-setups which many decks are centered around nowadays. Scrap Factory and Shark in hand will usually result in a Twin Dragon and a Wyvern as well as whatever you can come up with using the other 3 cards. I won't guarantee the deck will perform greatly but I will guarantee a certain degree of fun while playing it which is the most important in my opinion and Scraps just feel so underappreciated except for Recycler who funnily enough has no real place in a pure-ish Scrap build due to him being the only machine that would be run in the deck. You can build the deck more around him but the consistency of the Scrap engine would suffer from that."

This version cut some of the weaker cards for more interaction. Eldlich Dogmatika is two-pronged control deck, that seeks to win by using trap cards and slow, recursive value engines to grind out value in the long game, and in my opinion is the best shell for Dogmatika.

The Dogmatika line-up is 10 cards, and none of this has changed. 3 Nadir Servant are starters that search your Dogmatika monsters (Ecclesia) by sending monsters from the extra deck to the graveyard. This is a really powerful effect, since you can send cards like Wind Pegasus, or Nt'ss to get free interaction off of your search. More often, you can send Titaniklad, making this card essentially an Ecclesia that searchs both Fleurdelis and Punishment, which is insane. Ecclessia is your starter that searches interaction - in this deck it is a Normal Summon, and while you do dip into the extra deck most of the space is devoted to sending, and I'd say most games when things are going well you don't make any extra deck plays at all. Fleurdelis is a non-targeting negate and a beat-stick, and the deck's main output for damage. Punishment, however, is straight broken - for the cost of locking yourself out of the extra deck on your next turn, you can send 1 card from the extra deck to the GY to pop 1 monster card on the field (with less ATK than the sent monster). With N'tss this is a 2 for 1, but this is also a recursive engine thanks to Titaniklad, which really helps improve the deck's already stellar grind game. 1 Shaddoll Schism is here, just as a Trap card you can add to your hand by sending Apkallone from the extra deck, and then discard 1. This means Nadir Servant now doubles as both a way to get Golden Lord binned, but also as fodder to resurrect him. This 1 brick is extremely profitable IMO.

For Eldlich, thing have changed. We're still on 3 Golden Lord, but despite Cursed Eldland being such a big card, I decided I needed interactive cards to help get the game slowed down more than the consistency boost and Eldlich combos. We're also down to 2 Hauquero and 0 White Eldlixer. Too many games the White Eldlixer was just a dead card, and while this does technically reduce the power of Eldlich combos, the deck still puts up interaction like a mother, and I'd rather focus on getting things into a grind game to capitalize on my grindy engines.

For interactive cards we're at 15 total. Book of Moon is the best negative 1 in the game, useful both for helping break boards and for stalling people in making them. I don't normally love this card, but I think it is good in Eldlich and I wanted a tech option that was a Spell/Trap. Cosmic Cyclone seems really good in the main right now, what with a lot of the top decks taking advantage of trap cards in some way, and with many of those trap cards having GY effects. Doesn't hurt against Mine either. Imperm + Ash + Nibiru is just a pretty standard hand trap line-up for the format - these are good generic traps that hit most of the format. Imperm seems a little weak against Virtual World, but it has some uses there, and being a trap means there are a lot of benefits to running it in this shell. Good hand traps are good.

Extra deck is exactly the same - a lot of things for us to send with Dogmatika cards, and a handful of ""greatest hits"" for when we DO have access to the extra deck.

When Satellite Cannon is on the field, goad your target into attacking when it has little ATK then play Mirror Force, Rising Energy, or special summon Vic Viper T301 to boost the ATK enough and destroy 1 or more monsters on the field. If the Opponent is hesitant, use Battle Mania to force their hand. Limiter Removal should be used sparingly and only if its use can ensure certain victory, or in an emergency if you can summon Satellite Cannon from your Graveyard on your next turn.

The Side Deck offers A-Assault Core if you prefer to use union monsters to bolster Satellite Cannon and offer more protection, as well as Cyber Repair Plant, Seal of Orichalcos, and Threatening Roar as alternatives to recovery, bolster, and defensive tactics.

The combo only requires you to open <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a>, and will be explained below. The Side Deck is still in construction, as I am considering replacing the Invoked engine with the Dogmatika engine.
<ol>
 	<li>Normal Summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 003"">Deskbot 003</a></li>
 	<li>Special Summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a></li>
 	<li>Link Summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></li>
 	<li>Summon another <strong>001</strong> from your Deck</li>
 	<li>Link Summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a></li>
 	<li>Summon 3 tokens, reviving both <strong>001s</strong>, and summoning 2 <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a></li>
 	<li>Overlay into <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a>, activating his effect to search for <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes</a>, and <strong>Herald's</strong> effect for <a data-name=""Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord"">Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord</a></li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Aurora's</strong> effect, tributing the third token and <strong>Gallant</strong> for <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, searching for </a><a data-name=""Earth Chant"">Earth Chant</a></li>
 	<li>Activate <strong>Coltwing's</strong> effect, summoning 2 tokens and both <strong>001s</strong></li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon a third <strong>Herald </strong>and an <a data-name=""Old Entity Cthugua"">Old Entity Cthugua</a></li>
 	<li>Summon the <a data-name=""Gigantes"">Gigantes </a>from your hand, and then overlay all 4 monsters to make <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a></li>
 	<li><strong>Cthugua</strong> will let you draw a card, and <strong>Alembertian</strong> will let you search <a data-name=""Thunder of Ruler"">Thunder of Ruler</a></li>
 	<li>Your detached <strong>Herald</strong> will let you search <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Super Soldier"">Black Luster Soldier - Super Soldier</a></li>
 	<li>Ritual Summon <strong>Amorphactor Pain</strong> using <strong>Super Soldier</strong></li>
 	<li>Set <a data-name=""Thunder of Ruler"">Thunder of Ruler</a> and as many face-downs as possible in case your opponent has Spell Speed 2 Spell/Trap Removal, as they can <strong>MST</strong> your <a data-name=""Thunder of Ruler"">Thunder of Ruler</a> during their Draw Phase</li>
 	<li>Pass turn, activating <a data-name=""Thunder of Ruler"">Thunder of Ruler</a> to skip their entire turn</li>
 	<li>Next turn, make <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> using <strong>Aurora</strong> and <strong>Alembertian</strong></li>
 	<li>And with that, you should have a 5300 <strong>AT</strong> with 2 pops and a 2950 <strong>Amorphactor Pain</strong>, which should be enough for lethal</li>
</ol>
What happens if you don't open the combo? Or if it gets interrupted? Or what if you opened <strong>Coltwing</strong>, the only garnet?

That is why the rest of the deck is there. And there you have it, a fun, interacting, and engaging combo that you will certainly not get bored of by the fifth time."

There's a surprisingly high amount of synergy between the two strategies and opening with a couple of playmakers can lead to some absurdly good boards.

The primary plan is to go first and try to establish ABC-Dragon Buster and El Shaddoll Winda on turn 1. This puts the opponent in an extremely bad position to try and play from since Winda restricts the actions they can take each turn while ABC can clean up their much more manageable board. Any opening with Union Hangar and a Doll will allow this opening since you can turn your 2 ABC monsters into a Verte Anaconda and then copy a fusion spell and use Anaconda as the dark monster.

Going 2nd is still a fine place to be in. Shaddoll Fusion obviously shines here and we still have enough room to run the Shaddoll OTK combo along with potentially making Buster along the way.

I don't know if it's necessarily any better than the archetypes by themselves, but it's a lot of fun with the potential to do some really busted stuff!"

This Mayakashi build is an update from the previous build as well as some cards that I am thinking of adding to the deck such as one copy of Ghost Sister, 1 Mezuki, Mayakashi Manuscript and Rivalry of the warlords. However, these are a few cards that I am thinking of adding to the deck since finding a copy of the Zombie Horde SD is quite hard to find since it has a variety of staples and generic zombie support that can help boost the deck a lot. So far this is a rough idea of what I planned to do with the deck and I wish to hear your guys feedback and suggestions of how I can improve the deck.

The reasoning for Solid Dragon's inclusion (along with OG Blue-Eyes) is that with it, Sphere's becomes a bounce and a negate that can turn into a 3000 body. Plus, the combos with the tuners very well."

Okay, so Linkross is a big hit to the deck, basically losing a free extender out of the extra deck, and killing off MY pathways instead of normal (more successful?) Rokket players. HOWEVER, old paths are still possible, and many broken cards are still accessible to achieve the dream of comboing off to unbreakable boards.

I initially wanted to cut the deck back down to 40, but I found that wouldn't work with the number of cards I now considered essential. In the end, I settled on 49 cards - slightly bulkier than I could cut it to, but with good solid ratios and a reasonable amount of interaction for a combo deck.

In the second build, I increased the Red-Eyes engine. Having more bricks might seem bad, and Wyvern is not a good card, but since this combo path eats up cards and wants to end on Dragoon, I liked being able to add 2 cards to discard and potentially even one more to put back into the deck.

We still have all of our starters - 3 Seyfert, 3 Chaos Space, the Black and White Dragon, One for One , Black Metal Dragon, and REDM. That's 11 cards that either get you there, or get you there with another of your monsters, (over 1/5 of the 49 card deck) and Chaos Space is also a broken extender when you see it. The Rokket Package at this point is pretty standard, these are the essentials. One Brotaur still makes the cut to search your dragons, with Levianeer to search, but generally you almost always want to search your Black Metal Dragon. 1 each of Boot Sector Launch and Dragon Ravine, which are combo pieces and good cards, and 1 Divine Lance ance and 1 Dragunity Phalanx, for the option to make Needlefibre and generate value off of Plaguespreader Zombie, also just nice to have when you see Ravine. For extenders it is 3 Noctovision, which is straight busted, 3 Quick Launch which is honestly similarly busted, and 2 World Legacy Guardragon, alongside the 1 Monster Reborn. Quick Launch can actually start you, Noctovision extends you while drawing a free card, and World Legacy Guardragon can get you value in a grind game, or be popped by Tracer to preserve your field spell. The deck also plays through hand traps pretty well, since 2 dragons starts you nicely. Adding to this, the Dragoon Package is also in here. The idea was to be the 2019 Rokket deck, except with all the modern bells and whistles. Dragoon can be an insane back-up boss monster, in case you don't see enough extenders, or can help you end on the five negate board (which is still a 2 card combo even without Linkross, though you need a discard for Dragoon.) If you can trigger Black Metal Dragon multiple times in a turn, you can easily fuel the discard for this card. Lastly, for hand traps, I think 3 Ash Blossom and 3 Ghost Belle seems good for this current format, since both hit Virtual World and Eldlich reasonably well, while being generally useful interactive cards in a lot of other matchups, and then I took some backrow removal main, since it seems really good right now with Zoo and Eldlich playing together, as well as all of the Traps being worked into modern archetypes, including Virtual World. Traps are good right now, so I'm assuming hosing traps is good right now. Cosmic seems the spell of choice in the format, sensible with Eldlich and Virtual World both having GY effects on their traps.

I always like to bring Hand Traps in the side, so for this side I chose 3 Nibiru. These could honestly be main deckable, but it feels like people are prepared for it now, and modern combos are resilient enough that Nib often isn't enough anymore. Nonetheless, sometimes I'll need more hand traps, and Nib is the best bet that isn't Gamma (I just don't have room for the Driver). I also have 3 Lancea, which I like against Virtual World, and which works with the Dagda package in the extra deck. DRNM is our going second board breaking card - the deck has some board breaking and OTK potential, especially with Borrelsword Dragon still being relevant in this particular deck (sees some other niche play, but not much). Still, we're a going first combo deck, so some free ""I win"" cards in certain matchups are probably a good idea. We've got 2 Lightning Storm and a Harpie's Feather Duster for backrow, adding to the Cosmic pressure when going second - these are also helpful in breaking boards, but being flexible means I can slot these in the Spell/Trap removal slot while also breaking boards sometimes. D.D.G is our going first ""skip your turn"" flex cards - if you know you're going first, you can cheese out wins with these cards against most meta decks. These are more controlly cards, but I like having the option to play more control, particularly since we're now ending on slightly smaller boards of a few powerful negatey beatstickes. One of the main goals of the deck is to us up an opponent's negates and then make Dragoon to win.

Extra deck is every card needed to combo off into Savage + Abomination off of 1 card, plus Dragoon and Needlefibre, to generate as much easy value out of the extra deck as possible. There's also a Borrelsword Dragon in there to OTK going second, and Apollo, to set up even more negates going first.

Combos

Combo 1 - Seyfert, or any 2 Dragons on the field, including a level 4 or lower. This combo requires pitching 1 card as well.

1 - Summon Seyfert, eff, add Black Dragon

2 - Banish Seyfert, summon Black Dragon

3 - Link Black Dragon into Striker Dragon - chain links debateable, but add Boot Sector Launch and White Dragon

4 - Banish Black Dragon, summon White Dragon

5 - Link Striker + White Dragon into Romulus, add Dragon Ravine

6 - Dragon Ravine, discard 1, send Absorouter Dragon, add Tracer

7 - Boot Sector Launch, summon Tracer

8 - Tracer eff, destroy Boot Sector, summon Silverrokket (locked into DARKs out of the extra deck now)

9 - Link Silverrokket into Elpy, Tracer into Striker (momentarily locked into Dragons)

10 - Summon Black Metal Dragon (we are looking to abuse the everloving heck out of this thing not having a once per turn)

11 - Link Black Metal into Pisty, add Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon

12 - Banish Striker, summon REDM to the far corner.

13 - Pisty eff, summon Black Metal.

14 - REDM eff, summon Tracer

15 - Link Black Metal + Pisty into Quadborrel, add Red-Eyes Wyvern

16 - Link Pisty + Elpy into Dillingerous Dragon

17 - Quadborrel eff, targeting Dillingerous Dragon - end result is you summon back the Tracer, Siverrokket, and Dillingerous Dragon

18 - Make Borreload Savage

19 - Make Unchained Abomination

20 - Make Verte Anaconda

21 - Make Dragoon. Is this Red-Eyes?? ;)

22 - Abomination eff, pop Verte Anaconda. It has done its job

So, that's 3 discards total - 1 for Ravine that you can't get around in this route, 1 for Quadborrel that the combo fuels, and 1 for Dragoon on your opponent's turn. In exchange you get 2 omni-negates, one which destroys, and a thing that pops cards when your negate destroys and during the end phase (not to mention during the Battle Phase is something is beat over). However, with a single extender you can mitigate the first discard and make Apollousa before you summon Elpy, making the combo both more powerful and harder to interrupt. At its very peak the deck can simultaneously draw and search a lot of cards in its combos to fuel the great hunger it has for discards. Generally the deck can actually land on all 4 of the main monsters pretty easily - going first your goal in a lot of games is Apollo + Savage + Dragoon + A-Bomb. Going second you're trying to play through negates and break boards with Dragoon + Abomb, and/or OTK with Borrelsword Dragon.

Added a small Artifact package to the deck. I think Lancea is just good as a hand trap right now, particularly against Virtual World, and the deck can make Dagda easily through Needlefibre in its normal combos, or as an alternative to Dark Dragoon if you don't have a card to pitch, with Unchained Abomination helping trigger Dagda and the Scythe, particularly alongside a Rokket Tracer.

For example if your play against a rouge deck like blue eyes, and they summon Chaos Max, then you should summon Draco Berserker of the Tenyi to destroy a monster then gain its attack, then attack over Chaos Max. Or if your going up against a deck that likes having cards in the grave you can summon Punishment Dragon, also he is a good reset if you have too many cards in the grave or banished. This build also helps with spot removal, having cards like Chaos Dragon Levianeer, Judgment Dragon, Archnemeses Eschatos, and Tornado Dragon. You can also lock your opponent out of special summoning after a board wipe with Archlord Krystia."

Either summon Hajun and use his ability to get Dakki, or summon Dakki and use Yuki-Musume's ability to summon Yuki-Musume. Once you have either of these, Synchro summon the Wheeled Mayakashi. You then use Dakki's ability to summon her back and you will find you can Synchro again. Keep up this process until you get the Skeletal Mayakashi. Then use Yuki-Musume's ability to summon her back, then send Mezuki to the Graveyard. Mezuki can summon any Graveyard monster back by banishing himself. This means if your Mayakashi monsters are beaten, you can summon them right back. You can also use Card Destruction to get a new hand if you need to. Now for Eldlich... Use Scarlet Sanguine to summon Eldlich. If Eldlich is defeated, you can discard 1 Spell/Trap, then get Eldlich back and summon him stronger than ever! If Scarlet Sanguine is destroyed, use it's effect and set the Conquistador. Then if the Conquistador is defeated, you can get another Scarlet Sanguine.

Combo is tailored to summon all the new cards. Not only they have nice artwork, they also have great effects. The Albaz ritual sees and chips your opponent extra deck, while the Stigma fusion summons more fusion and able to float during the end phase. If combo fails, we simply play Dogmatika anyway lol. Starter is Formud Skipper, so Cynet Mining and One for One make us have 7 starters. Combo is in the video above.

Pros: Fun combo deck with legit setup, Dogmatika themed.

Cons: Big bricks, weaker version of Dogmatika."

(Feat Tri-Brigade Kit and Bearbloom the Solid Assault!)","

OK, so in July 2020, I made a pure Tribrigade deck, but I was too lazy to finish testing it. But now that Tri-Brigade Kit and Bearbloom are a thing, I finally got around to making a deck profile. That lead me to making this masterpiece. I call it ""Tri-Brigade Mirko the Lapin Legend"", after <strong><em>My Hero Academia's</em></strong> best waifu, Mirko the Rabbit Hero(""Lapin"" is another word for ""Rabbit"")!

It does make sense considering that the majority of the monsters are humanoid animals, and that almost all of the monsters are animalistic in general.

As for the deck's strategy, it can do well going first or second. First because the deck can either end on a Tri-Brigade Revolt or the Apex Avian/Thunderbird infinite negates loop. Second because the deck uses 9 hand traps, 2 Lightning Storm, and Harpie's Feather Duster. Cockadoodledoo is mainly there to go into Halqifibrax and link climb into Accesscode Talker if going second. As for the side deck, it uses 12 cards that can be used in the meta, and 3 Reborn Tengu because its floating effect makes it a good extender for Tri-Brigade."
