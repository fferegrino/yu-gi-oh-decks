This deck has carried me to platinum on 3 different accounts easily. Although the stigma to an FTK deck is that it's prone to bricking, this deck is very consistent since the six samurai engine is absolutely broken (I'm looking at you, Gateway of the Six !).
<h4>Card Explanation:</h4>
<h5>Monster Cards:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Six Samurai Fuma</strong>
A monster that you can easily summon with one bushido counter on Shien's Dojo. That's basically the only thing he's used for.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong>
An easily summonable warrior monster for Isolde. It can also special summon a level-4 or lower warrior monster from your hand.</li>
 	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Kageki</strong>
Useful for first plays since it special summons other level-4 or lower six samurai monsters from your hand. It is also a great discard target for Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai since this card is easily searchable through Isolde</li>
 	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai</strong>
A staple for summoning Saryuja Skull Dread, Isolde, Bamboozling Gossip Shadow, Ghostrick Alucard-- basically summons everything.</li>
 	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho</strong>
Basically the same as Shinai, but it can free up your field for some more special summons.</li>
 	<li><strong>Legendary Six Samurai - Kizan</strong>
An easily summonable monster that is used to summon the XYZ monster that you need.</li>
 	<li><strong>Grandmaster of the Six Samurai</strong>
An easily summonable monster that is used as a different name for summoning Saryuja Skull Dread</li>
</ul>
<h5>Spell Cards:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Monster Reborn</strong>
Used to be able to extend the combo for summoning Ghostrick Alucard</li>
 	<li><strong>Upstart Goblin</strong>
A free space on the deck. You can also replace this card with another draw card such as Into the Void</li>
 	<li><strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong>
To search for Kizan/Kageki</li>
 	<li><strong>Golden Bamboo Sword</strong>
Helps with drawing cards you need. It is also easily searchable with Isolde by discarding Cursed Bamboo Sword</li>
 	<li><strong>Shien's Smoke Signal</strong>
To search for Kageki/Shinai/Mizuho</li>
 	<li><strong>Overlay Regen</strong>
A staple. You need this card in your hand to add a material to Heraldry Crest</li>
 	<li><strong>Broken Bamboo Sword</strong>
Used to enable Golden Bamboo Sword</li>
 	<li><strong>Cursed Bamboo Sword</strong>

 	<li><strong>Moon Mirror Shield</strong>

 	<li><strong>Living Fossil</strong>
Another Isolde target, but it can also be used to special summon any level-4 or lower monster from your GY</li>
 	<li><strong>""Infernoble Arms - Durendal""</strong>
A card that can search for Fire Flint Lady / Mizuho, it is also a target for Isolde</li>
 	<li><strong>Temple of the Six</strong>
Free Bushido Counter generator</li>
 	<li><strong>Six Samurai United</strong>
A pot of greed that can generate Bushido Counter if need be</li>
 	<li><strong>Gateway of the Six</strong>
This card is not once per turn. So you can basically summon an infinite amount of monsters from your deck / GY</li>
 	<li><strong>Shien's Dojo</strong>
Another Bushido Counter generator, it can also be used as a combo extender to summon Ghostrick Alucard</li>
 	<li><strong>Called by the Grave</strong>
Just in case your opponent has Maxx ""C"" or Ash Blossom</li>
</ul>
<h5>Extra Deck:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Ghostrick Alucard</strong>
The target for Heraldry Crest in order to summon Ghostick Angel of Mischief</li>
 	<li><strong>Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</strong>
Adds 5 materials to your Heraldry Crest</li>
 	<li><strong>Daigusto Emeral</strong>
You need 2 of this card to do the infinite draw combo. It is also used as a failsafe if your Heraldry Crest or Ghostrick Alucard gets nibiru'd</li>
 	<li><strong>Heraldry Crest</strong>
Since this card is a Number XYZ Monster, this card can be targeted by Bamboozling Gossip Shadow to add more materials to it. This card's name can be changed to another XYZ Monster's name, this is used to summon Ghostrick Angel of Mischief with 10 materials since after this card's effect is activated, its name becomes Ghostrick Alucard.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ghostrick Angel of Mischief</strong>
The core of your deck. This card can be summoned with 2 level 4 monsters OR another Ghostrick XYZ monster. If this card has 10 materials, you win the duel</li>
 	<li><strong>Dugares the Timeless</strong>
A level-4 XYZ monster that lets you draw 2 cards and discard 1 card. Make sure you have a throwable away card in your hand though in case both cards you drew are useful</li>
 	<li><strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong>
Used to search a discard target and a bamboo sword card. It is also used to special summon a Six Samurai monster for Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai. You can also use this card to bait Ash Blossom</li>
 	<li><strong>Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai</strong>
Free Bushido Counter generator. Most of the time, you'd want to summon your six samurai monsters to the zone this card points to. This card is also necessary to search for Gateway of the Six if you don't have it in your hand.</li>
 	<li><strong>Saryuja Skull Dread</strong>
A free draw and a free special summon. Necessary for infinite draws.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Early Game Combo:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Summon 2 warrior monsters from your hand using Kageki into another level-4 or lower Six Samurai, a Six Samurai monster + fire flint lady, Mizuho and Shinai, or any Six Samurai monster + Kizan.</li>
 	<li>Summon Isolde using 2 warrior monsters to get a discard target + a bamboo card and to summon a Shinai.</li>
 	<li>Summon Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai using Isolde and another Six Samurai monster. Make sure you bait out any negates such as Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence, etc before you summon this card.</li>
 	<li>Get Gateway of the Six if you don't have it yet. If you do, get Shien's Dojo for combo extender or Six Samurai United for drawing cards.</li>
 	<li>Special summon any six samurai monsters you have in your hand to get Bushido Counters on both Battle Shogun and Gateway of the Six</li>
 	<li>From here on out, just draw cards using your extra deck monsters such as Dugares, Saryuja, or Daigusto Emeral</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Win Condition Combo:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Summon Heraldry Crest first</li>
 	<li>Then summon Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</li>
 	<li>Activate Bamboozling Gossip Shadow, target Heraldry Crest</li>
 	<li>Use either Monster Reborn, Living Fossil, or Shien's Dojo to special summon any level-3 Six Samurai</li>
 	<li>Summon another level-3 using Gateway of the Six</li>
 	<li>Summon Ghostrick Alucard with the two level-3 monsters you summoned before</li>
 	<li>Activate Heraldry Crest, and target Ghostrick Alucard. Heraldry Crest's name is now Ghostrick Alucard</li>
 	<li>Activate Overlay Regen, target Heraldry Crest</li>
 	<li>Summon Ghostrick Angel of Mischief using Heraldry Crest</li>
</ul>

<hr />

So how does one get to summon and draw all of those cards?
Daigusto Emeral + Saryuja Skull Dread is absolutely broken, and with 2 Daigusto Emerals, it's basically an infinite draw. How? you may ask, here's the combo:
<h4>Infinite Draw Combo:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Use Saryuja Skull Dread's effect to draw 4 cards, and return 3 to the deck</li>
 	<li>Summon Mizuho and Shinai using Gateway of the Six</li>
 	<li>Activate Mizuho's effect to tribute Shinai and destroy Saryuja Skull Dread</li>
 	<li>Shinai's effect will activate in the graveyard to add 1 Six Samurai monster to your hand, add Kizan</li>
 	<li>Special summon 2 Kizans, 1 from Shinai's effect and 1 from Gateway of the Six</li>
 	<li>Summon Daigusto Emeral, activate its effect to add Saryuja, Daigusto Emeral, and another monster of your choice (preferably level-3 monsters)</li>
 	<li>You can then summon Saryuja again and activate its effect since both Daigusto Emeral and Saryuja Skull Dread are not a hard once per turn.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>What this deck is weak to:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Early Nibiru</strong>
Nibiru is absolutely devastating if you don't have Shien's Dojo or Monster Reborn in your hand/field. But if you have either of those, it's still fine.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bricking</strong>
This is a common problem for most decks, honestly. Although yes, this deck is consistent, it is as consistent as most decks, so there is still a possibility for bricking. A brick hand would be 5 spells that do not summon or add a Six Samurai monster to your hand/field, and that's basically it.</li>
 	<li><strong>Battle Shogun being negated while not having Gateway of the Six in your hand/field.</strong>
Gateway of the Six is the core of this deck. If you don't have it, or if you can't search for it, it's basically game.</li>
 	<li><strong>Going Second</strong>
Going second against a meta deck would be a game-ender since most meta decks right now are revolved around negates.</li>

[Made for Master Duel]","This deck is a relatively simple, somewhat budget approach to Skull Servants in Master Duel that only uses a few high rarity cards aside from the meta staples that you should already have. The deck largely runs itself; Clown Zombie mills Baking from deck, Baking grabs Prince &amp; Mare, dumps Prince. Prince mills a Servant and Lady, then banishes those for a King, and Mare discards for a Lady. Pretty basic, but what makes it shine is how versatile the deck can be with the extra deck. Since you have so many low attack monsters, Geonator Transverser can practically steal games by giving the opponent a weakling. Borrelsword can easily be link-climbed into from the basic opener by using Uni-zombie to go into Halqifibrax. And with some very careful planning, you can go from Halq into Shooting Riser into Ametrix and shut down opponent's attacks.

Of note is Nibiru. While in most decks, Nibiru requires you to have removal to avoid a massive token, KoSS can often simply overpower the token, especially with the help of Wightprincess.

Of the UR's present, i would say that the 3 Un-zombies and one Avendread Savior are non-negotiable. They make it so easy to get what you need, and their ability to discard both from the deck and hand can come in clutch. Many of the others are Staple cards that can be subbed in and out as your budget provides. Thankfully, a majority of the power players here are all found in the same Secret Pack, so 3-4 10pulls will give you most of what you need.

As for improvements to the deck, I would look towards MBT's excellent list that utilizes That Grass Looks Greener, found here: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxUO3oLaGcw</a> .

Thanks for checking my list out!"

Choice is yours","

<strong>Watch the Video for Games on how the deck is played! and for questions comment on the video as I am only on this website once a day!</strong>

This deck is the real deal. Not only is this deck insanely good for the synchro festival, its insanely good in general. I am talking about going 15-0 in ranked just playing the deck, on top of that I hit plat in less than 3 hours of playing. (that's with breaks in between due to waiting 10 years for opponents turns) Most games Opponents will just scoop if they can't interact with your turn one because getting 2-3 negates is fairly easy with this deck. Now it is very vunerable to Nibiru but most decks in the event will be as well, you can argue putting some in for this list. I opted against so because I think there will be alot of backrow decks and lightning storm could help alot with that.

Edit: I want to preface going into early crystal wing synchron is a good play in this event as alot of people are running nibiru. Almost considering crossout designator"

1) terraforming
2) Point of the mysterune
3) by activating any mysterune card and summoning Huggin.
A good board in the first round is to have a board with:spring of the mysterune, Huggin (to prevent the destruction of the spring), and deceit,  also at least 2 mysterune's card in the hand.</span>"

I typically Link Curious into Apollousa for two monster negates then Synchro Borreload Savage Dragon for 3 omni-negates. If the opponent destroys Curious from the back row, you even get to get another card from the GY. Finish the board with Archlord Kristya.

Many of the cards in this deck plays around/baits Ash Blossom.
<ul>
 	<li>All Danger! cards</li>
 	<li>Normal Summon Raiden -&gt; effect</li>
 	<li>Charge of Light Brigade sends cards to graveyard even if the card draw is negates</li>
</ul>
The only cards you don't want Ash Blossomed are Chaos Ruler, Solar Recharge and Grass.

If you don't want to run an extra deck, replace Ghost Reaper with Droll and lock bird.

If you have Crossout Desginator replace Called by the Grave.

Mind crush is fun since everyone will be searching cards.

Magical hats can be replaced with another Abominable Chamber of the unchained.

Enjoy!"

This gives you 1 Monster effect negate, 1 spell/trap negate(2 spell/trap negates during your turn) and a monster that can swing over any level 5 or higher monster for 3,000 damage, regardless of how much attack the monster has. Here is an example of a standard combo for the deck:

Combo Pieces Needed: D/D Swirl Slime, D/D Necro Slime, D/D Lamia

As long as you have at least 2 of those 3 combo pieces you can usually search for the 3rd through Dark Contract with the Gate.

Example Hand: D/D Lamia, D/D Swirl Slime, D/D Savant Kepler, Any 2 other cards.

Combo for Example Hand: Normal Summon D/D Savant Kepler, use his effect to search for Dark Contract with the gate. Activate Dark Contract with the Gate. Search for the missing combo piece(in this case, D/D Necro Slime). Activate D/D Swirl Slime's effect, fusion summoning D/D/D Flame King Genghis using D/D Swirl Slime and D/D Necro Slime. Activate D/D Swirl Slime's effect in the graveyard to special summon D/D Lamia. Use D/D Lamia and D/D/D Flame King Genghis to Synchro summon D/D/D Gust King Alexander. Activate D/D Necro Slime's effect in the graveyard to fusion summon D/D/D High Flame King Genghis using D/D Necro Slime and D/D/D Flame King Genghis. Activate D/D/D Gust King Alexander's effect to summon D/D Lamia from the graveyard. Use D/D Lamia and D/D/D Gust King Alexander to Synchro summon D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried. Activate D/D/D High Flame King Genghis to special summon D/D/D Gust King Alexander from the graveyard. Activate D/D Lamia's effect in the graveyard, sending the Dark Contract with the Gate(or any of the cards remaining in your hand) to the graveyard to special summon her from the graveyard. Use D/D Lamia and D/D/D Gust King Alexander to special summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.

There are MANY ways to do this combo within this deck, this is just one example of a standard way of creating your board. If anyone would like any tips/help with D/D/Ds let me know and I can offer my knowledge on the archetype. Pretty cheap deck to make in Master Duel as well. Enjoy! :D"

This is how you win with them without cheating like Zigfried did.

The win condition of the deck is resolving grass to get all combo pieces to Two(?) Turn Kill unprepared players which when it comes to meta decks is pretty much nobody. Most of the deck is tailored for that purpose and to improve consistency, you want to have Final Light or Ride of the Valkyries resolve to summon a few Valkyries to the board and get a second battlephase thanks to Mischief of the Time Goddess's unique effect. Goddess Urd's veredict protects your Valkyries while Jet Synchron and Halquifibrax are two very busted cards that net you some backup plays as well as more draw power thanks to a few busted Synchro monsters and will improve consistency, give you acceptable turn 1 boards with an Omni Negate, let you maybe survive another turn or even pick up wins against some weaker decks thanks to how busted Borreload Savage Dragon and Auroradon are.

Once you have picked up on the deck's main strategies it's almost as brainless as Numeron OTK, just more RNGish and harder to get enough firepower on the field to OTK. Remember how in the Anime they only played with 4000 LP? Yeah... A few things to keep in mind: Ride of the Valkyries while good, will shuffle back <strong>ALL</strong> monsters on your field back into the deck at the end of the turn, yes, including that Borreload you just made. <strong><em>UNLESS</em></strong> you have triggered Mischief of the time goddess in the same turn, except Mischief won't work if you have any monster that's not a Valkyrie on the field. So forget about comboing into Borreload to get more ATK on the board for the kill outside of the one in a thousand chance you got 2-3 high Level Valkyries + Borreload + Auroradon up and the opponent is pretty much wide open. That said because Mischief of the Time Goddess lets you bypass Ride of the Valkyries's second effect you're free to combo into Borreload to end your turn, so don't get hasty with that Jet Synchron/Plaguespreader Zombie effect in your GY. Playing smart will win you more duels.

Staples/Handtraps depend on meta/preference as well as Banlist availability. This whole deck is crippled if Grass gets banned/limited/negated so keep that in mind. Crossout Designator is maybe a card one should run at 3 depending on how many handtraps you use. In general you don't want to be running too many non normal spells/traps because you can use Valkyrie Vierte's effect to mill a few cards and maybe get one of Grass/Mallet/Ride of the Valkyries/Final Light onto your hand for a quite big consistency boost. As a rule of thumb, if you haven't won by turn 4 or at worst turn 6 you lost. If you bricked you lost. If the opponent is a decent player running a half decent deck you lost. Yeah, Valkyries are just not good on modern Yugioh and the only reason this kinda works is Grass is one of the most broken cards in the game."

Unexpected Dai, Tour Guide of the Underworld, Rescue Rabbit, Emergency Teleport. All get you the Tuner on field you need in order to get Halq out. Genex controller is a backup machine type monster in deck in the event you end up using 001 + Dai/E-Tele for your Tuner+1 into Halq. Kaiju's, Sphere Mode, and Nibiru serve the role to remove on-field threats either en-mass or strategically, specifically the wind and water kaiju's for Low Atk and dealing with Wind Barrier Statue.

The primary combo would seek to utilize Magikey Mechmusket - Batobuster as a major search engine. Ideally you would start with 1 in hand but if not there are methods to pull it out. A combo line that you would seek would be summoning Halq any way possible, pulling out 001 to link into Auroradon. This would pull out 3 tokens + 001 from the grave off of its own effect. Synchro for 4 into Herald of Arc light then use Auroradon to tribute Herald and a token to pull out Coltwing. This would give you 2 more tokens as well as either Batobuster or Advanced Ritual Art in order to summon one you may already have in your hand. This would then allow you to summon it allowing you to add Magikey World to your hand. This field spell is drastically overpowered not only adding you a Magikey Monster to your hand but more importantly allowing you to add the Fusion/Ritual spell as well as returning a Garnet back to your deck. At this stage you would want to add Magneficent Magikey Mafteal to your hand and trigger its effect for a 2nd normal summon. You do not have to normal summon it immediately at this point and it is recommended you don't. Using the 2nd effect of the Field spell allows you to add the Fusion/Ritual spell to your hand which enables Fusion/Ritual Summon from Deck while you control a normal monster, tokens included. This allows you to send any normal monster + 1 Magikey monster to Special Summon Magikey Beast Ansyalabolas, recycling your Ritual/Fusion spell. At this point you should have pulled out 001 off of Coltwing allowing you to Synchro for 7 for either Clear Wing Fast Dragon or F.A. Dawn Dragster (thank god the Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens are wind). You need to keep the token on field in order to trigger the ""Send from Deck"" effect of Magikey Mafeta. Fusing first then ritual summoning the 2nd time after recycling the spell would enable 2 level 4 tuners on the field at the same time as your Level 3 token and Level 7 Coltwing. You can Synchro for 7 first for Fast/Dawn (whichever one you didn't get first)  in order to drop Coltwings Level back to 4 in order to Synchro for 8. Savage if you own it or Dragite if you don't own a Savage. Halq serves as the water type for Dragrite if you are worried. This would give you Fast + Dragster + Savage/Dragite while having the triggered Magineficent Magikey in Hand. At this point Normal summon it and use its effect to special summon a non-tuner Magikey Monster for the Level 8 Synchro Transfurlmine. Transfurlmine allows you to set a magikey Spell/Trap from deck as well as a HOPT trap hole, it is recommended to set the Spell/Trap Magikey Counter Trap in order to not be nuked by Dark Ruler No More. This field should enable 1 Omni-Negate from Savage or a S/T Negate from Dragite, 1 S/T negate via Dragster, 1 Extra Deck monster negate via Fast, a Trap Hole from Transfurmine, and a counter trap negate from Magikey Unlocking. After that fill the deck with your favorite Fuse from deck monster that can use Normal-Monsters as fusion material such as Rainbow Neos, or Dragoon. Unfortunately there are no Normal Destiny Hero monsters for DPE and the Extra deck would be too cramped for it anyway. Alternate strategies include buffing the Hell out of Mechmoarter for a Monster effect negate thanks to its Atk gaining bonus.

Weaknesses include droplet, Dark ruler no more, generally any ""cannot respond"" cards.

P.S. It is possible in a severely desperate state to use the pendulum effects of Hallo Hallo and Magicalibra to increase the level of Dawn Dragster to extremes, buff its attack and pierce for game."

Hand traps, as well as Destrudo, are meant to enable synchro plays with Odd-Eyes and level 9 synchros. The Zefra archetype cards are present to provide access to trap cards on short notice. Strategy is somewhat solid but deck composition is unrefined.

The first linked video shows the test hand replays made using this deck. The second linked video shows the exact deck list that is shown here but it also goes into the reasoning as to why each set of cards is played. The third linked video shows six different replays in which I describe the events of each duel through each play, at least for the most part. Furthermore, the third video shows the deck list and the immediate changes that I would make to it based on its displayed performance, as well as explanations for said changes.

A weak archetype focused on putting your opponent in face-up defense position and gaining advantage off of i,"&nbsp;
<h3>Description and Strategies</h3>
The main gimmick of Spiders, is putting your opponent's monsters into face-up Defense Position, and gaining advantage off of that. The deck doesn't synergise perfectly with itself, so strategies must be used to cater to each card individually:
<ul>
 	<li>Mother Spider works as long as your opponent has 2 face-up Defense Position monsters. As she simply tributes them to Special Summon herself. Cards like Earthquake and Spider's Web greatly improve this. As they can force your opponent into Defense Position on a larger scale. It's best to use this to tribute stronger monsters your opponent controls.</li>
 	<li>Spyder Spider works rather simply. If it destroys a Defense Position monster (face-up or face-down) you get to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Insect from your Graveyard. This can be used to Special Summon most cards in this deck.</li>
 	<li>Informer Spider must be destroyed by a card effect to activate it's effect. Which is to take control over a defense position monster your opponent controls. The easiest way to do this is to use Shield Crush on your own set Informer Spider.</li>
 	<li>Ground Spider has a soft Once Per Turn effect to set an opponent's summoned monster to Defense Position. However, this is only available if Ground Spider itself is in Defense Position. Earthquake can help with this. Additionally, attacking with Ground Spider into anything that wont destroy it while Spider's Web is active will also put Ground Spider into Defense Position without requiring you to wait a turn with it in Attack Position. Spyder Spider and Dragonbite are also capable of Special Summoning Ground Spider in face-up Defense Position.</li>
 	<li>Relinquished Spider can be utilized well in the later game. Use any established method to get your opponent's monsters in face-up Defense Position. Then you can summon Relinquished Spider (normal or special). It's effect allows you to tribute it as a cost, in order to destroy all face-up Defense Position monsters your opponent controls.</li>
</ul>
Dark Spider, even though it is technically a part of the archetype, does nothing to support it. And can't be used effectively. So it wasn't included. Underground Arachnid, is technically a part of the archetype as well. But it's barely used because it's hard to bring out in a Spider deck. Dragonbite is a Level 4 Dark Tuner, so summoning it with Relinquished Spider will allow you to summon it.

Some other noteworthy cards in the deck, that haven't been mentioned yet are:
<ul>
 	<li>Verdant Sanctuary, which allows you to add another Insect of the same level to your hand when an Insect is destroyed. This is helpful since most of the deck is consistently leveled.</li>
 	<li>Retaliating ""C"" and Resonance Insect, which both work as searchers for the other cards. Retaliating ""C"" searches every Insect in the deck (except Mother Spider). And Resonance Insect searches Mother Spider.</li>
 	<li>Spider's Lair, which isn't too helpful if Spider's Web is already active, but can work as a good alternative.</li>
 	<li>Enemy Controller, which both allows you to put a monster in face-up Defense Position, and allows you to tribute one of your monsters, to take control of an opponents. Which you can then tribute if you are capable. Note that you can actually use Enemy Controller more than once per turn. So you can Tribute a monster to take control of an opponents monster. Then Tribute that monster to take control of another monster. Which you can then tribute for Mother Spider or a Link Summon.</li>
 	<li>Butterflyoke, which in a way, locks your opponent's monster in whatever position you want them in. Though, it does require that monster to attack first.</li>
 	<li>Number 70: Malevolent Sin, which doesn't synergize with the deck other than being a Level 4 XYZ monster. But, it does have the appearance of a spider, and it's always good to have. As it can gain high ATK, and can get some pesky monsters out of the way for the turn.</li>
 	<li>Inzektor Picofalena, which can be used to equip Resonance Insect or Retaliating ""C"" onto another monster you control. Then you can get rid of the equipped monster, and activate their effects.</li>
 	<li>Insect Shinobi Hagakuremino, which allows you to Special Summon an Insect Monster when a card it points to is destroyed. It's just generally helpful for the deck. Especially with Inzektor Picofalena.</li>
 	<li>Seraphim Papillion also allows you to Special Summon Insects from your Graveyard. and works with Inzektor Picofalena as well.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Weaknesses</h4>
Spiders have a lot of weaknesses. They have low stats, so it's easy to simply get beaten over if you don't have the proper defenses. The deck is generally inconsistent as well. As it requires multiple cards in your hand to do anything. Their biggest weakness however, is Link Monsters. As Link Monsters can't be in Defense Position. Thus being immune to all of the Spider's effects.
<h4>Side Deck</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Galaxy Cyclone and Mystical Space Typhoon are for basic spell removal. In case of any sort of floodgate, or any other devastating trap/spell.</li>
 	<li>Mirror Force and Storming Mirror Force are mainly there to help deal with Link Monsters. As they can only be in Attack Position.</li>
 	<li>Dark Mirror Force is a fun addition in general. If you could only put some of their monsters in defense position, and they try to attack.</li>

This deck is so much fun and really gets you feeling nostalgic for when you played Yugioh in the school yard. Except instead of placing our cards on wet, hard, cold concrete with no sleeves we are doing so in a virtual world known as Master Duel. You the only regret you will have playing this deck is you can't see your opponent rage when you flip up skill drain. Any questions ask on my channel and I usually get around to answering them!"

What is Hell? Hell can be many things: from cutting your finger off a blender, to accidentally breaking your own board with one card you want to break on your opponent. Although most of us don't like it nor we deny it's existence, it is the external force that keeps spiritual balance to our world and beyond. The reality is however is that we are doing a terrible job at it, and that is why we are living in nothing but degeneracy and moral decay.

Despia is what is exactly from a stand point of anything being hell on earth; but the fact is deck I am using today won't be using <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a>or be running a fully functional Adventurer engine. This is in part due to the upcoming banlist making them the two hot spots for either bannings or limitations. So as with any Despia deck: you go with 3 Aluber, 2 Tragedy, 1 Ad Libitum, and 1 Comedy; but with the release of <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>, you can continue going with 2 <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> without concerns of Polymerization or that one Despia field spell that did things. Also besides <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>, another change I made to Branded - Despia is the addition of <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> (a card that seen play for quite a while now) and the new card <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> (A card that Special Summons a ""Despia"" or Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster, then goes into a fusion summon by banishing from either field). The extra deck also hasn't had any real significant changes from any other Despia - Albaz deck besides the newly released monsters from the Albaz Strike Structure Deck and with three link monsters, with whom (besides <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot; Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom&quot;&gt;Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloom&lt;/a&gt;y"">y</a> because he makes use of your opponents Dark monsters from the GY) have no significance besides fusion fodder and I'm ok with that.

No Special Summoning. Normal Summon forever.,"So i finally return with a more updated build of my previous Floowandereeze Dogmatika build.

A fair bit has changed since the previous format, but i will included a brief outline of the decks key themes as well as my changes.

The ratio of 2 Empen, 1 Raiza and 1 Apex I believe is still correct. 2 Empen is great when you need to stop decks reliant on their link monster effects to be able to play (Prank Kids, PK, Tri-Brigade and Striker), and always being able to search a second is always handy in case they are able to get through both statue and the first copy for special summon decks in general. 1 Raiza is enough with careful management to loop itself and your opponents cards back, especially if you have Unexplored Winds up. 1 Apex is a looping negate which makes the deck really strong.

The Dogmatika package has lost 1 copy of Nadir to the banlist, and 1 of the 2 copies of Punishment in my previous build, mainly as the Floowandereeze engine has much more consistency now and i require a backup plan less of the time.

The main deck does not feature Shifter or and handtraps because the deck has plently of board breaker/force negate options thanks to Nadir, Book Of Moon, Raigeki, Harpie's Feather Duster and dare i say it Mystic Mine. Shifter conflicts with the Dogmatika engine as well as being useless in an ever increasing number of mirror matches. Book Of Moon acts to prevent veiler/imperm negating vital Floowandereeze plays as well as trading off negates going second. Nadir is useful for baiting Ash as well as proving an option for Empen to normal summon Ecclessia in case you cannot get Barrier Statue out (or game 2/3 versus the mirror). Raigeki, Harpies and Mine also force negation or break boards. Being able to get rid of Mine naturally makes it great to stall until you have the resources you need.

A lone copy of Judgement in the main deck is there to prevent Droplets/DRNM/Raigeki/Lightning Storm from stopping Empen/Statute

Nothing has changed in the ED. Everything is very Dogmatika related bar Assembled Nightingale + Zeus package. Verdant is there on rare occasions to summon Baronne and posdibly opposing Apex/Raiza.

Side deck choices are simple. Dark Simorgh for Eldlich and other backrow heavy decks. D-Shifter VS everything except the mirror. Night Beam is my interesting tech choice. Being able to pick of set Dreaming Town in the mirror can really be useful, but can used against Sanguine in Eldlich  as well. Twin Twisters would result in discarding cards which isn't always the best option and Cyclone allows the likes of Dreaming Town to be recovered more easily with Toucan, being sent to grave means it has to banish itself via it's second effect or be banished by Stri.

Cheaper alternative. There arent a lot of expensive cards except Aluber and Chimere. Half of the deck is from (3) Structure,"Start with Branded Fusion to summon Albion Branded Following Mirrorjade. You get it with Springans Kitt or Aluber. Get Aluber with Branded Opening or Tragedy. Send Tragedy to gy by Burial Sakrophag, Allure or a fusion.

With Branded Lost get Springans Kitt or Mercourier if you need.

If you activate Mirrorjade send Sprind to gy to get a antother Springans for turn 2 or Brigrand to get Mercourier.

With Mirrorjade on field next to summon is Lubellion (Albaz and Dramaturg with Branded Fusion) following Dragostapelia for some negation and dont forget Dramaturg.

&nbsp;

For example a good field looks like Branded Lost and Theater, Mirrorjade Dragostapelia Quaeritis.

Without Chimere you dont need Poly, Mudragon and antoher Albaz should be fine.

I don't really like Dramaturge tbh, i think it can make the deck a bit unstable, so i'd rather side deck it.

The deck is full of extenders and combo makers, pretty much you just need 1 Blue Tang and ur set for the full combo, send SeaHorse to gy link into BlueSlug and so on to build your board by getting Marincess Dive to hand (that card is broken af), if ur in trouble you can go with splash mage and re-generate the board, keep in mind, before going for the link 4's you should first add the handtrap with Coral Triangle otherwise the board is too weak. You should definitely go for White Howling in going second games, that card is nuts. Be careful with ur extradeck don't waste it all 1st turn just to show-off use it wisely. P.S.

<span>I find the Heralds pretty cool. But personally, the usage of Herald of Ultimateness in some <span class=""ignored"">Drytron</span> decks never suited my tastes with them. And, as a very non-meta casual player, I wanted to create a less powerful deck built around them. This deck uses Herald of Perfection rather than Herald of Ultimateness for consistency; as it is easier to bring out Herald of Perfection.</span>
<h3><span>Description and Strategies</span></h3>
<span>The main gimmick is using Herald of Perfection to negate plays by your opponent by sending Fairies from your hand to the Graveyard. And as such, this deck's monsters are almost exclusively Fairies.
Eva, being a notable example, allows you to add 2 more Fairies to your hand when sent to the Graveyard. While the Heralds are good at shutting your opponent down, they have a considerable lack of offensive ability. Which is where Saffira, Queen of Dragons, Honest, and Hip Hoshiningen come in.</span>

<span>Saffira is a great help for more than offensive ability as she gets to add cards to your hand at the end of turns where <span class=""ignored"">a</span> <span class=""ignored"">LIGHT</span> monster was sent from your hand to the Graveyard. Which should be happening frequently due to the Herald's negation cost. Saffira's effect can benefit in many different ways within the deck. She can be used to recycle Eva and Honest. She can allow you to draw more cards to get what you want. Or you can cripple your opponent by discarding a card from their hand. Additionally, her ritual spell ""Hymn of Light"" works as R<span class=""ignored"">itual</span> Monster destruction protection. As if it is in the Graveyard, you can banish it instead of letting a ritual monster be destroyed. This is great if your opponent is able to beat over Herald of Perfection without activating effects which you can negate. Hymn of Light can also be discarded by Saffira's draw 2 effect, or can be set on the field in hopes your opponent destroys it. As long as it's in the Graveyard, it works.</span>

Don't underestimate the Non-Ritual Heralds either. They can be great hand-traps if you don't have Herald of Perfection on the field yet. This deck runs 3 copies of Herald of Orange Light, 2 of Green Light, and 1 of Purple Light. They can be used as fodder for Herald of Perfection. Or, they can negate your opponents effects according to their corresponding card types (Orange = Monster, Green = Spell, Purple = Trap). Orange Light is especially helpful as monster effects are typically the most important to shut down. And it also protects you from your opponent's hand traps, like Ash Blossom. Do note that using these three as hand traps has a heavy discard cost. So be careful with what you choose to negate.

&nbsp;

Some Knightmares are in the Extra Deck to compensate for the deck's lack of removal. Just in case you end up facing a field you cant deal with. And Salamangreat Almiraj to be able to send Eva to the Graveyard after normal summoning it (slight brick protection).
<h4><span>Weaknesses</span></h4>
<span>Of course, this deck is not without its weaknesses. Early on, it's easy to be denied access to Herald of Perfection. Additionally, Herald of Perfection has <span class=""ignored"">low</span> <span class=""ignored"">ATK</span>, so putting it in Attack Position is risky.
Also noteworthy, Herald of Perfection cannot negate Counter-Traps. A well-timed Counter-Trap can easily get rid of Herald of Perfection. Continuous Traps/Spells also can't be negated after they are first activated. Effects that don't warrant an actual activation (cards that special summon themselves, for instance) also can't be negated.
</span><span>And finally, Herald of Perfection's negation cost is a discard. So you will typically be low on card advantage. Meaning, if your board is broken, it may be hard to build it up again.</span>
<h4><span>Side Deck</span></h4>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Herald of Ultimateness and it's Ritual Spell is in the Side Deck in case it's wanted to be played.</span></li>
 	<li><span>A Timelord is in the Side Deck so Diviner of Herald can gain its level to summon Ultimateness. This can be replaced with any Level 10 Fairy-type Extra Deck Monster.</span></li>
 	<li><span>3 of the Non-Ritual Main Deck Heralds are in the Side Deck so <span class=""ignored"">TCG</span> format can be played by replacing Eva with them.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Some draw power through Pot of Extravagance is in there as well. As it may be needed if you need more cards in your hand.</span></li>
</ul>
It should be noted, the Side Deck for this deck isn't a proper Side Deck. It adds more options but not much else. I would recommend filling the Side Deck with cards that counter certain decks."

I put some chaos cards 'cause sinergices with The Fables, Ojama, and Cyber Dragons being Light monster and Dangers, Dark Worlds, and Chaos monsters being Dark Monsters. Ojama can be useful 'cause of it's effect of when being sent to the grave while being in the field or hand to both players drawing 1 card and discarding one card.

I put in Paleos for two reasons one Dinomischus it's a great card and 'cause of the Discard effect and two They can be used as Link/Tribute fodder.
So something you should take into account when playing this deck it's Dark World's rulings. So just to summarize Dark World only activate their effect when they are discarded BY AN EFFECT, if it's discarded by COST they would not trigger. Don't worry Fables and Dangers trigger even as Discard cost.

Ok so just to help anyone using Dark Worlds. I'll clarify which ones are cost and which ones are effect.
COST (Dark worlds WON'T trigger):
Lighting Vortex and Phoenix Wind Wing Blast.
They're more cards that count as Cost, but these are the ones in this decks.
EFFECT (Dark worlds will trigger):
Dangers, Bone Temple Block, Danger! Zone, Fabled Treason, Fabled Raven, and Paleozoic Dinomischus.

If you wish you could use this Decklist as a basis for your future decks.

Super fun and relatively cheap (low UR CP without Side Deck). The more consiste","<span>  <strong>   If you want to make this deck I highly recommend opening the ""Savage Crimson Dragon"" secret pack as most of the URs and SRs come from that one pack. It is relatively cheap to make if you exclude the Side Deck.   </strong>  </span>

&nbsp;

<span>     Literally just switch BLS out for any of the Synchros already in the extra deck or from the side deck if you want to use it in the Synchro Festival. Otherwise BLS can be very situationally useful as it cannot be targeted by card effects (Red Supernova and Red Nova can't be destroyed by card effects but CAN be targeted and thus negated, banished, or returned to hand/deck).</span>

&nbsp;

<span>     The <strong>Main</strong> and <strong>Extra Deck</strong> is what I am <strong>currently running/what got me to Plat</strong>. The Side Deck is full of staples I think would be beneficial to add <strong>if you already have them, </strong>they are not necessary for the deck to work properly! <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> plus <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> are probably the most helpful as the go-to combo often has 5 or more summons. <a data-name=""Called by the Grave "">Called by the Grave is also pretty helpful for countering </a><a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom </a><a data-name=""Called by the Grave "">or </a><a data-name=""Called by the Grave "">Maxx ""C.""</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave &quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  "">  </a><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave &quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  ""> can also be useful in some situations but keep in mind it can't be used to make </a><a data-name=""Red Nova Dragon"">Red Nova Dragon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Called by the Grave &quot;&gt;Maxx &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  "">.</a></span>

&nbsp;
<p><span><strong><span>Strategy</span></strong></span></p>
<span><strong>ALWAYS USE CRIMSON RESONATOR'S EFFECT BEFORE SUMMONING ANYTHING ELSE!!</strong></span>

<span>      Always go first if able. Ideal end board is solo <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a> (made with Chaos Ruler) with 1 or more <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a>s/Trap Trick and Solemn Judgement set. This way you have 2 potential board nukes or 1 nuke and an invincible 6000 ATK Monster, plus you don't banish your own monsters and you can bring back Chaos Ruler next turn. THE KEY IS TO WAIT until your opponent is almost finished with their combo OR attempts to banish, negate, or return to hand Supernova Dragon before using Red Reign in order to maximize its effect.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>     <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a> is the backbone of this deck and allows it to fairly easily beat Tri Brigade, Sky Striker, Virtual World, etc so long as you go first due to its non-targeting banish and its ability to make Red Supernova Dragon unaffected by card effects (very few decks can hit above 6,000+ ATK and even if they can you can nuke their field with Red Supernova's on attack declaration quick effect). Use it every turn because odds are you will be able to return it to hand. For this reason I want to add Trap Trick to this deck for the frustrating occasions when it isn't in the top 10 cards of the deck.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>     If you successfully did full first-turn combo (Red Supernova Dragon on the field with Chaos Ruler, 1 Light, and 1 Dark in GY) don't be afraid to use Supernova's effect that banishes it for cost, because you have a guaranteed Chaos Ruler plus whatever combos you still have in hand for the next turn while your opponent has likely used most of their cards.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>     Nibiru and Ash Blossom are problems, but usually your Nibiru will be more powerful than your opponent's and if you managed to get Chaos Ruler and 1 Light in the GY you can bring him back and continue comboing or go into BLS. Also, usually you can combo through and bait out Ash because of how many search and special summon from hand effects are in this deck. The MAXX ""C"" challenge has gone 50/50 in my experience.</span>

&nbsp;
<p><span><strong>Boss Monsters</strong></span></p>
<span><a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a></span>

<span>     Legit one of the best trap cards in the whole game when used in this deck. It non-targeting banishes all monsters except those with the highest level, so if you have Lv. 12 Red Supernova Dragon out on the field it's a full nuke. This is the main reason why you want to go first. BUT ITS BEST EFFECT IS THAT IT CAN RECYCLE INFINITELY by adding it to hand from GY when you synchro summon. All Extra Deck monsters but 1 are Dark Dragon Synchro monsters, so this just happens automatically in your combos. <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> synergizes with this card perfectly, as it gives you 5 extra chances at ""drawing"" <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a>. Also, Chaos Ruler's GY effect means you can pretty much always synchro summon again on your Second Turn.</span>

<span>     Furthermore, it makes your <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a> into a nearly impenetrable wall of ATK by making it unaffected by your opponent's card effects for 1 turn. If you use this card at the right time, it can easily guarantee a win. Lets also not miss the fact that this card's board nuke effect IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE USE PER TURN. So if you have 1 Red Reign in hand and 1 gets sent to the GY by Chaos Ruler during the combo, you have 2 board nukes and the ability to chain the invincibility effect if your opponent can react to the first. For this reason I want to add Trap Trick to further increase consistency. </span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a></span>

<span>     Go-to boss monster. On average 6,000 ATK when summoned on first turn. Can't be destroyed by card effects, but CAN BE TARGETED &gt; use Red Reign to make up for this weakness. On monster effect or attack declaration it can BANISH ALL CARDS YOUR OPPONENT CONTROLS, yes that means spells and traps too! (it also comes back to your field at the end of your nest End Phase). Wish it had an animation though.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Red Nova Dragon"">Red Nova Dragon</a></span>

<span>     Worse version of Red Supernova Dragon, but still an absolute beatstick. No board nuke quick effect, but still unable to be destroyed by card effect (can still be targeted though). MAIN THING TO REMEMBER is that to make Red Nova you HAVE TO USE Red Dragon Archfiend or Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</a></span>

<span>     Low-Key has the most OP effect in the entire game &gt; STOPS YOUR OPPONENT FROM ACTIVATING ALL CARD EFEFCTS FOR ONE TURN! This absolutely destroys Dragonmaids and other decks with lots of Battle Phase or On Attack effects, as well as trap heavy decks that get too greedy and wait for your boss monster to come out (your opponent cannot react to this effect with card effects).</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"">Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span>

<span>     Newest addition to the deck, still in testing phase. Adds another nuke and negate to the deck. Nuff said</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane</a></span>

<span>     Usually only used on your second turn or later. Can sacrifice another monster on the field to bring back another ""Red Dragon Archfiend."" Often you will use one of the free, special summon from hand or GY monsters to do this (Synkron, Creation, Wandering King, Chaos Ruler). This also works well with its ability to summon 2 tuners (1 from deck and 1 from GY) after doing damage.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a></span>

<span>     Go-to negate for the deck, works on all card effects used ON THE FIELD (can't negate GY or hand effects). Works pretty well as a replacement for Red Supernova Dragon if you brick and can't summon it SO LONG AS YOU HAVE RED REIGN. Summons a tuner from your GY after if does damage &gt; this often means you can get some extra combos in Main Phase 2. Synchro summoning this monster is an easy way to get <a data-name=""Red Reign"">Red Reign</a> back on your Second Turn as there are 7 Lv. 1 tuners in the deck and if you got the proper First Turn combo you should be able to get <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler"">Chaos Ruler</a> back from the GY.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a></span>

<span>     Main Lv. 8 Synchro Dark Dragon you will be using for combo purposes. Its ability to come back from the GY by banishing 1 Dark and 1 Light monster from the GY makes it great synchro fodder and bait for negates. Its on-summon excavate ability is doubly useful as it can provide extra combos and get a Red Reign in the GY (which will be returned to hand when you use Chaos Ruler to synchro another Dark Dragon). The real MVP of the deck.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span>

<span>     Just a better version of Red Dragon Archfiend. Go-to when making Red Nova Dragon. Its effect to destroy all special summoned monsters with less or equal ATK can be very useful, and you can always use it as synchro fodder after activating this effect.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</a></span>

<span>    Good defensive wall if you happen to brick and can only get out a Lv. 8. It can also become a pretty strong beatstick in certain situations and punishes opponents for using burn strategies that don't OTK.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a></span>

<span>     Classic, but kinda trash. Its ability to destroy all Defense Position monsters can be situationally useful, but its secondary effect can backfire significantly and precludes any Main Phase 2 combos. Still useful for making Red Nova Dragon though. </span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Red Rising Dragon"">Red Rising Dragon</a></span>

<span>     Basically an anti-brick measure by making Wandering King more useful in-hand. Can make Red Supernova Dragon if you also have Crimson Resonator (just pick 2 Lv.2's instead of 2 Lv.1's). Can also use it to get a massive Life Point boost by bringing back Red Resonator and targeting your 6,000+ ATK Red Supernova Dragon.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</a></span>

<span>     Situationally very useful due to the fact it cant be targeted by card effects (this covers the weakness of Red Supernova and Red Nova). You won't always be able to summon it though because some of the combo cards limit you to Synchro or Dark Dragon monsters only for 1 turn.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p><span><strong><span><span>Combo Cards</span></span></strong></span></p>
<span><a data-name=""Synkron Resonator"">Synkron Resonator</a></span>

<span>     Great for making <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a> or as fodder for <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend</a>'s effect. Second effect is great for letting you set up Second Turn combos based on what you have in-hand.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Chain Resonator"">Chain Resonator</a></span>

<span>     EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CARD! The 2 copies of this card are the ONLY 2 Light monsters in this deck, which you need for <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>'s effect. THEREFORE, YOU NEED AS MANY COPIES OF THIS CARD AS YOU HAVE OF CHAOS RULER! Its normal summon effect can be very helpful for many Second Turn combos, and being Lv. 1 it can make <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a>. </span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a></span>

<span>     1-Card combo. Usually select <a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a> the first time you use its summon effect (just read combos) but once the combo is set up, select <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a> because it basically guarantees you can special summon <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> next turn.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a></span>

<span>     Great backup combo starter. Even better backup secondary effect (on special summon it lets you gain Life Points based on the ATK of a monster on the field, yes even your 6,000+ ATK <a data-name=""Red Supernova Dragon"">Red Supernova Dragon</a>) for emergency situations. Often a good idea to use its normal summon effect with <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>, because you can make a Lv. 10 that way.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a></span>

<span>     ALWAYS USE THIS CARD'S IN HAND EFFECT BEFORE SUMMONING ANYTHING! It is often a good idea to try to bait out <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> by using <a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a> even if you already have Crimson in hand, because if they ash Crimson's second effect rather than Chaos Ruler's effect then you can't make Red Supernova Dragon. It can be a good idea to return it to hand with <a data-name=""Synkron Resonator"">Synkron Resonator</a>'s effect just in case your board gets cleared because you can then use its full effect on your Second Turn.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Wandering King Wildwind"">Wandering King Wildwind</a></span>

<span>     Its GY effect makes great bait for <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>s or other negates if you already have a combo in hand. Otherwise, it can help you get the card you need. For this reason I often don't select it with Chaos Ruler's effect unless I specifically need it for a combo because then it ends up in the GY. Like all special summon from-hand cards in this deck, makes great fodder for <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane</a>'s effect.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Ascator, Dawnwalker</span>

<span>     The backup Lv. 8 synchro option because of its discard cost. It really hurts when this card gets Ash Blossomed so I usually try to use another card first. IF EVER POSSIBLE, DISCARD <a data-name=""RED REIGN"">RED REIGN</a>! You will bring it back to your hand immediately after you use Ascator to synchro summon. A second-best option is <a data-name=""Fire Ant Ascator"">Fire Ant Ascator</a> because it is useless in hand.</span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a></span>

<span>     Great bait for negates, people seem to have a deep fear of searchers. Usually used to get <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a> in hand. </span>

&nbsp;

<span><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a></span>

<span>     Another great bait option if you have more combos in hand. Great because it saves you normal summoning <a data-name=""Psi-Reflector"">Psi-Reflector</a> or <a data-name=""Assault Sentinel"">Assault Sentinel</a>.</span>

&nbsp;

It has a rather large hand tax so I debated adding cards like ""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"", ""Metalfoes Fusion"" or ""Omni Dragon Brotaur"".

Any suggestions (other then buy aluber) would be appreciated.

Thanks for checking it out!"

It’s kinda consistent (but can still brick hard) and very good at beating down opponents who overlook effects, which they usually do (people never notice that master Cerberus can’t be destroyed when 4 or more spell counters are on the field)

Once you get the right setup you can start doing some pretty insane combos, I still make misplays like crazy even though I’ve improved sense I started using the deck.

The first objective is getting electrumite out and astrograph into your extra, the setups astrograph

allows in this particular deck can help take you from there, looping astrograph lets you get the maximum amount of spell counters to work with.

Sadly, people always seem to leave mid combo."

Eldlich allows for the deck to accelerate thanks to its ability to summon any Zombie monster from the eldlixer cards. I do wish the OCG cards for Mayakashi were here to help with banish recovery, but that's what the Shiranuis are for. If you wish to side out or completely remove Rivalry, I'd full edit the deck to remove the Shiranuis for PSY Framelord Omega and probably tank set up instead of the King Ha Des cheat. Up to you.

<p>- A Yang Zing Monster probably</p>
&nbsp;

Frustrated that your Arc Light always get beaten up by some Normal Summoned monsters because your opponent actually knows how to use their BP properly? Doesn't like that you have to play 2 Yang Zings in order to fully take advantage of Nine Pillars? Well, in this NEW HalqDon Combo, not only does your Yang Zing float to a Handtrap, but your Arc Light is also CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY BATTLE.

Inspired by the Brave Tenyi from the OCG and B.A.S.E.D. from the TCG, I have created a <em>similar</em> Deck (The TCG/OCG has Swordsoul so its different okay). Through its Full Combo, you will end with the same board as the old Halq Combo, except instead of a random Yang Zing that doesn't really do anything, you will have Chaofeng which can search a Handtrap when destroyed by Nine Pillars or lock your opponent from using effects of a specific Attribute, also your Arc Light is indestructible by battle. And yeah Baronne(ss) is there too... (Why did the TCG remove the ss from Baron?). So anyway, here's the Combo and Deck Breakdown.
<h1>Combo</h1>
There's only one combo that you need to know really, it's basically Baronne + Halq (Ashuna/Vishuda + Red Rose Dragon)
<ol>
 	<li>Ashuna/Vishuda Effect to Special themself -&gt; Normal Summon Red Rose Dragon</li>

 	<li>Link Halq and 001 into Auroradon -&gt; Special 3 Tokens -&gt; Special Deskbot 001 from GY</li>
 	<li>Synchro 2 Tokens and Deskbot 001 into Yazi -&gt; Baronne pop Yazi -&gt; Float into Mare Mare</li>
 	<li>Mare Mare Special a Token (1) -&gt; Auroradon Tribute itself and Mare Mare Token to Special O-Lion from Deck</li>
 	<li>Synchro Token and O-Lion into Denglong -&gt; Search Nine Pillars</li>
 	<li>Mare Mare Special another Token (2) -&gt; Denglong Send Ashuna/Vishuda to become Lvl 7</li>
 	<li>Synchro Denglong and Mare Mare Token into Borreload (On the EMZ, otherwise you won't have enough slot) -&gt; Equip Auroradon -&gt; Denglong float into Bi'an</li>
 	<li>Mare Mare Special the last Token (3) -&gt; Synchro Mare Mare and Mare Mare Token into Accel Synchron</li>

And there you go, 4 Omnis + Handtrap search (Ash, Veiler, or Ghost Ogre) and your opponent can't attack over Arc Light anymore. You know what that means? DROPLET AND DARK RULER CAN'T COUNTER YOU LETS GOOO. Still vulnerable to Kaiju and Super Poly though.

Alternatively, if you already use Baronne to negate on your own turn, you can leave Bi'an on the field. Baronne can bring back Denglong and Bi'an can Quick Synchro with it into Baxia. That's Unicorn for 2.

If you happen to have a certain grudge against DARK Attribute, you can Special Taotie instead of Bi'an, and decrease Accel Synchron's Level instead. With this, you can Synchro into Chaofeng that locks your opponent from using DARK monsters effect. Then, you can Ashuna Effect to Special Mapura from Deck and Synchro into Draco Berserker. Or if you hate Adamancipator with passion, you can give up Arc Light battle protection to lock your opponent from using EARTH monsters effect with Bi'an + Accel Synchron = Chaofeng. For LIGHT monsters, you can use Baxia + Adhara/Jet Synchron (Adhara can be Special by Ashuna if you control a Token). But, not locking your opponent is actually the best choice, since you have to pop Chaofeng with Nine Pillars eventually (Arc Light battle protection is more important).

And yes, I won't give you a different Combo so you can actually learn the Deck for yourself by practicing. The Combo of this Deck varies, depending on your hand and opponent's interaction.
<h1>Deck Breakdown</h1>
Instead of using a long list like before, I will group cards into paragraphs instead. This way it's easier to explain cards with similar effects/usage.
<h2>Main Deck</h2>
<p><a data-name=""3x Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">3x Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a>; <a data-name=""3x Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">3x Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a>; <a data-name=""3x Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">3x Tenyi Spirit - Adhara</a>; <a data-name=""1x Tenyi Spirit - Mapura"">1x Tenyi Spirit - Mapura</a></p>
<p>These Tenyi are your starters as you can Special them for FREE if you control no Effect monsters. <strong>Ashuna</strong> and <strong>Vishuda</strong> are Level 7 which are perfect for <strong>Baronne</strong> as you have plenty of Level 3 Tuners on the Deck. <strong>Adhara</strong> is just a free Tuner to use for <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> and <strong>Mapura</strong> is the worst one. Additionally, these Tenyi monsters have an extra effect if you control a non-Effect monster, which in this Deck, you have a bunch of Tokens and the Extra Deck Tenyi: <strong>Monk of the Tenyi</strong> is also a non-Effect monster. You can banish them from your HAND (and yes people do forget that you can use it from hand) or GY. <strong>Ashuna</strong> Special a Tenyi from Deck but locks you into Wyrm for the rest of the turn. <strong>Vishuda</strong> can bounce a card your opponent controls. <strong>Adhara</strong> can add back a banished Wyrm. And <strong>Mapura</strong> can negate an effect that targets your non-Effect monsters.</p>
<p>So, why do I play <strong>Mapura</strong>? Well, it's because it's Level 4 which I need for <strong>Ashuna</strong> Effect. <strong>Shthana</strong> is actually a much better choice as it has a better effect where you can crash your <strong>Monk</strong> to a monster and revive it back while popping a monster your opponent controls (worse <strong>Vishuda</strong> basically). But due to <strong>Mare Mare</strong> being a WATER, I have to play a different Attribute so <strong>Baxia</strong> can shuffle 2 cards instead of 1.</p>
<p><a data-name=""3x Red Rose Dragon"">3x Red Rose Dragon</a>; <a data-name=""1x Roxrose Dragon"">1x Roxrose Dragon</a>; <a data-name=""1x Basal Rose Shoot"">1x Basal Rose Shoot</a></p>
<p>This is the Rose Dragon Package/Engine. When Combined with <strong>Ashuna</strong>/<strong>Vishuda</strong>, you can get a FREE <strong>Halq</strong> after Summoning Baronne. <strong>Red Rose</strong> float into <strong>Roxrose</strong> from hand or Deck when used as Synchro Material and <strong>Roxrose</strong> Search <strong>Basal Rose</strong> when Summoned which can Special a Rose Dragon from hand or GY.</p>
<p>I'm playing 3 <strong>Red Rose</strong> because you absolutely want to Normal Summon it every single game. Only 1 <strong>Roxrose</strong> and 1 <strong>Basal Rose</strong> because they are searchable that you will only use once and probably don't want to draw them. They aren't bricks, but you would rather Search them instead and have a different card in your hand.</p>
<p><a data-name=""2x Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">2x Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion</a>; <a data-name=""1x Deskbot 001"">1x Deskbot 001</a>; <a data-name=""1x Mare Mare"">1x Mare Mare</a>; <a data-name=""1x Jet Synchron"">1x Jet Synchron</a></p>
<p>These are your most important Combo Pieces that you don't want to draw no matter what. <strong>001</strong> is your <strong>Halq</strong> target, it allows you to climb into <strong>Auroradon</strong> while reviving itself after. <strong>O-Lion</strong> is your Auroradon 2nd Effect target, not only it's a Level 2 Tuner, it also replace itself with a Token when sent to GY. <strong>Mare Mare</strong> is my favorite one, it can ONLY be Special Summoned by a Wyrm monster's Effect, which we have <strong>Yazi</strong> for that. Giving you a free 3 Level 1 Tokens for some insane Synchro Plays while also being a Level 4 Tuner after that. Lastly we have <strong>Jet Synchron</strong>, can be sent from Deck to GY with Accel Synchron, then can revive itself from GY by sending a card from hand to GY (doesn't count as discard btw, so can't do it under something like Arc Light or Dimensional Fissure).</p>
<p>I'm playing 2 <strong>O-Lion</strong> because <strong>O-Lion</strong> is THAT important and is pretty much dead most of the time if you draw it. The other 3 are 1 ofs. If you draw <strong>Mare Mare</strong>, that's fine because you can still Combo without <strong>Mare Mare</strong>. Same with <strong>Jet Synchron</strong>. <strong>001</strong> however, is still alive if you draw it since <strong>Halq</strong> can Summon from hand, but you rather draw something else.</p>
<p><a data-name=""1x Bi'an, Earth of the Yang Zing"">1x Bi'an, Earth of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Taotie, Shadow of the Yang Zing"">1x Taotie, Shadow of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing"">1x Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing</a></p>
<p>These are your targets for <strong>Denglong</strong> Effect. <strong>Denglong</strong> can Search <strong>Nine Pillars</strong> on Summon and Float into <strong>Bi'an</strong> or <strong>Taotie</strong> when sent to GY. <strong>Bi'an</strong> is a Level 3 and <strong>Taotie</strong> is a Level 5. When they're destroyed, they can float into each other from Deck only. Unfortunately both Special in DEFENSE and both have 0 DEF, but that's alright since we play them solely for their Level. <strong>Bi'an</strong> however, has an extra Effect, giving battle protection when used as Synchro Material while <strong>Taotie</strong> prevents your opponent from stealing the Synchro. You can also Quick Synchro them with <strong>Denglong</strong> during your opponent's turn to go into <strong>Baronne</strong>, <strong>Baxia</strong>, or <strong>Borreload</strong> even. You can change <strong>Taotie</strong> for another copy of <strong>Bi'an</strong> since <strong>Denglong</strong> can only Special from Deck and not hand too. But I like having 2 different Yang Zing so that they can float. Then we have <strong>Nine Pillars</strong>, the Omni-Negate Counter Trap that only live if you control a Yang Zing (The then Effect is mandatory and needed)</p>
<p><a data-name=""3x Sangan"">3x Sangan</a>; <a data-name=""1x Crusadia Arboria"">1x Crusadia Arboria</a>; <a data-name=""1x Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">1x Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a></p>
<p><strong>Arboria</strong> and <strong>Destrudo</strong> are Extenders while <strong>Sangan</strong> is a starter. You can Normal Summon <strong>Sangan</strong> and Link it into <strong>Almiraj</strong> in order to search <strong>Arboria</strong>, or a Handtrap if you already have <strong>Arboria</strong>. Then you can go <strong>Halq</strong> after. You can also use <strong>Sangan</strong> to chain Block <strong>Halq</strong> if you decided to NOT go for the 1 card Combo and instead Summon another monster (Tuner) and go directly into <strong>Halq</strong>. You can also use <strong>Arboria</strong> and a <strong>Tenyi</strong> to go into <strong>Halq</strong> without committing to your Normal Summon. <strong>Destrudo</strong> serves the same purpose, except you can't use it on Level 7+ monsters which <strong>Ashuna</strong>/<strong>Vishuda</strong> are, or a Link Monster.</p>
<p>I'm playing 3 <strong>Sangan</strong> because it's a 1 card <strong>Halq</strong>. If you don't open <strong>Red Rose</strong>, you can try using <strong>E-Tele</strong> instead to make <strong>Baronne</strong> then Normal Summon <strong>Sangan</strong> into Full Combo. Only playing 1 <strong>Arboria</strong> because it's searchable with <strong>Sangan</strong>. And only 1 <strong>Destrudo</strong> because <strong>Destrudo</strong> is just there if you fail your Combo due to opponent's disruptions and doesn't actually save you if <strong>Halq</strong>/<strong>Auroradon</strong> got negated. Also <strong>Destrudo</strong> is a Free <strong>Yazi</strong>.</p>
<p><a data-name=""3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>; <a data-name=""3x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">3x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a>; <a data-name=""3x Effect Veiler"">3x Effect Veiler</a>; <a data-name=""3x Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">3x Maxx ""C""</a>; <a data-name=""2x Emergency Teleport"">2x Emergency Teleport</a> (E-Tele)</p>
<p>These are your main Handtraps. You probably already knows what <strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Veiler</strong>, and <strong>Maxx ""C""</strong> does so I'm not gonna explain it here. <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> however, is a Handtrap you don't normally see (or see it everyday if you play TCG). It's Effect is not bad, it's just not good enough to be played over <strong>Ash</strong> or <strong>Veiler</strong>. <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> not only serves as a Handtrap, it's also an Extender with <strong>E-Tele</strong> as it's a Level 3 Tuner Psychic. Not only that, you can use <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> not only from your hand, but also field. So, if you don't need to extend with <strong>E-Tele</strong>, you can just Set it and Summon <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> on your opponent's turn and still use it's Effect.</p>
<p>If you don't want to play <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong>, that's fine though I recommend you to have it because it will be VERY GOOD in like 6 months or something when Grand Creators come to Master Duel. You can use <strong>Psychic Wheeleder</strong> as an alternative which is only an SR. It's obviously not as good, but you can Special it from hand if you control a Level 3 which Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens are and can pop monsters when used as Synchro Material.</p>
<p><a data-name=""3x Crossout Designator"">3x Crossout Designator</a>; <a data-name=""2x Called by the Grave"">2x Called by the Grave</a>; <a data-name=""1x Nibiru, the Primal Being"">1x Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>; <a data-name=""1x D.D. Crow"">1x D.D. Crow</a>; <a data-name=""1x Infinite Impermanence"">1x Infinite Impermanence</a></p>
<p><strong>Crossout</strong> and <strong>Called by</strong> are your Anti-Handtraps while <strong>Nibiru</strong>, <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>, and <strong>Imperm</strong> are just <strong>Crossout </strong>target while also being a good Handtrap to have. You absolutely HAVE TO STOP your opponent from negating your <strong>Halq</strong>, or else you pass with like nothing. That's why I have 3 <strong>Crossout</strong> here. I'm not playing <strong>Droll</strong> and <strong>Ghost Belle</strong> because <strong>Droll</strong> doesn't really stop you from doing your Combo and I haven't really see anyone playing <strong>Ghost Belle</strong> yet. <strong>Nibiru</strong> and <strong>Imperm</strong> are quite common to see in ladder, while <strong>D.D. Crow</strong> is played by Tri-Brigade. <strong>Crossout</strong> is also better than <strong>Called by</strong> when negating a Handtrap that you already have in your hand as <strong>Called by</strong> negate the monster it banish until the end of NEXT TURN (Pls don't forget that). Additionally, you can also <strong>Crossout</strong> <strong>E-Tele</strong> against Virtual World and <strong>Crossout</strong> a Tenyi for a Mirror match or Swordsoul when BoDE come to Master Duel in 2 months.</p>

<h2>Extra Deck</h2>
<p><a data-name=""1x Baronne de Fleur"">1x Baronne de Fleur</a>; <a data-name=""1x Borreload Savage Dragon"">1x Borreload Savage Dragon</a>; <a data-name=""1x F.A. Dawn Dragster"">1x F.A. Dawn Dragster</a>; <a data-name=""1x Herald of the Arc Light"">1x Herald of the Arc Light</a></p>
<p>These are your negates. All of them except <strong>Dragster</strong> can negate anything. <strong>Baronne</strong> has an extra Effect to pop a card once per turn, and an Effect on Standby Phase that does come up. If <strong>Baronne</strong> is already out of negate, you can return it to EX in order to revive a Level 9 or lower monster from GY (could be <strong>Arc Light</strong>, <strong>Denglong</strong>, <strong>Chaofeng</strong>, or anything). <strong>Borreload</strong> is just a big boi with 4050 ATK, and its negate doesn't destroy, so try using it to negate GY Effect or non-continuous Spell/Trap instead of monsters on hand or field. <strong>Dragster</strong> is an insteresting one, it only negate Spell/Trap and become Level 5 after the negate. You can easily go into <strong>Dragster</strong> with <strong>Destrudo</strong>. And lastly, <strong>Arc Light</strong>, the most hated one. Banishes any monster sent from hand or Main Deck to GY. This will make Tri-Brigade players instantly surrenders and prevent your opponent from using Droplet (they can only send monsters from field which is a huge minus, and if they send no monsters, you can just negate the Droplet). The biggest problem though, is that <strong>Arc Light</strong> only has 600 ATK and 1000 DEF, can easily get attacked over. However, if Summoned using <strong>Bi'an</strong>, it completely cover up it's one and only flaws. However, <strong>Arc Light</strong> also disables your <strong>Veiler</strong>, <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong>, and <strong>Maxx ""C"" </strong>but not <strong>Ash</strong> and <strong>D.D. Crow</strong>.</p>
<p><a data-name=""1x Chaofeng, Phantom of the Yang Zing"">1x Chaofeng, Phantom of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Baxia, Brightess of the Yang Zing"">1x Baxia, Brightess of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>; <a data-name=""1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing"">1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</a></p>
<p><strong>Chaofeng</strong> is a good card when paired with <strong>Nine Pillars</strong>, it allows you to search ANY Tuner from Deck with no restrictions when destroyed (yes it's a ""when"" Effect so it can mistiming). This means you can search <strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Veiler</strong>, or <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> after negating with <strong>Nine Pillars</strong>. However, <strong>Chaofeng</strong> can mistiming, meaning that you HAVE TO use <strong>Nine Pillars</strong> as cl2 no matter what because popping your <strong>Chaofeng</strong> has to be last action that happens within that chain (If cl1 is negated, then cl2 is the last action). Not only that, the ""then"" Effect only happens if the card is shuffled into the Deck. So if you negate a card that sends itself to GY or banish itself as cost (like <strong>Fraktall</strong> or <strong>Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</strong>), then you don't get to shuffle it, therefore you don't destroy your Yang Zing. <strong>Chaofeng</strong> also locks your opponent using the same Attribute as a Yang Zing monster used as material. <strong>Chaofeng</strong> also has a 3rd Effect (read it yourself).</p>
<p>Next, we have <strong>Baxia</strong>. Not part of your main Combo but good to have nonetheless. Shuffles cards on field on Summon up to the number of Wyrm monsters used as material with different Attributes. Your tenyi has different Attributes, your Yang Zing too, and Mare Mare is WATER (which is why I play Mapura over Shthana). <strong>Baxia</strong> can also revive a Level 4 or lower by popping a card you control (can revive <strong>Arc Light</strong>). Then there's <strong>Yazi</strong>, whose cannot be targeted by opponent's card. Can pop itself and your opponent's card while also floats into ANY Wyrm from Deck. <strong>Yazi</strong> is much better going 2nd, because you don't have to use <strong>Baronne</strong> or <strong>Auroradon</strong> to pop it and trigger its floating Effect. You can simply use its own Effect</p>
<p>Lastly, we have <strong>Draco Berserker</strong>, an underatted generic Level 8 Synchro. <strong>Draco Berserker</strong> can attack twice on monsters and gain a bunch of ATK permanently. It can also banish a monster in response to their Effects (good for something like <strong>Raye</strong> or Normal Summons). Also it's a Wyrm, so you can Synchro into it after <strong>Ashuna</strong> Effect.</p>
<p><a data-name=""1x Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">1x Denglong, First of the Yang Zing</a>; <a data-name=""1x Accel Synchron"">1x Accel Synchron</a>; <a data-name=""1x Shooting Riser Dragon"">1x Shooting Riser Dragon</a></p>
<p>These are your Synchro Tuners, which you need because you're Summoning a bunch of non-Tuner Tokens with <strong>Auroradon</strong> and <strong>Mare Mare</strong>. <strong>Denglong</strong> is the Best one, it's a literal +3. Search a Yang Zing card on Summon, send a Wyrm from Deck to GY to change Level, and Floats into a Yang Zing when leaving the field. Also <strong>Denglong</strong> is Level 5 so Token + <strong>O-Lion</strong> can make it. <strong>Accel Synchron</strong> can Send <strong>Jet Synchron</strong> from Deck to GY to increase or decrease its Level, also it can Quick Synchro on opponent's turn. <strong>Shooting Riser</strong> can Send any Level 6 or lower monster from Deck to GY on Summon to change Level and it can Quick Synchro on opponent's turn. You don't really Synchro into it at all, it's Simply there for <strong>Halq</strong> 2nd Effect target. Alternatively, you can play <strong>Desert Locust</strong> or <strong>Formula Synchron</strong>, but <strong>Shooting Riser</strong> is more Versatile.</p>
<p><a data-name=""1x Crystron Halqifibrax"">1x Crystron Halqifibrax</a>; <a data-name=""1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a></p>
<p>Ah yes, who doesn't know about these duo? The Combo that's literally splashable in any Synchro Deck and takes no effort to go into. <strong>Halq</strong> on Summon can Summon a Level 3 or lower Tuner from Deck and can banish itself on opponent's turn to Special a Synchro Tuner from EX (yes this is treated as a Synchro Summon). <strong>Auroradon</strong> on Summon can Summon 3 Level 3 Tokens. Can Tribute up to 3 cards to respectively: Pop a card, Special a Mecha Phantom Beast from Deck, and add a Trap from GY.</p>
<p><a data-name=""1x Monk of the Tenyi"">1x Monk of the Tenyi</a>; <a data-name=""1x Salamangreat Almiraj"">1x Salamangreat Almiraj</a></p>
<p>You need <strong>Monk</strong> in order to Special <strong>Arboria</strong> from hand (if you draw it) and go into <strong>Halq</strong>. <strong>Monk</strong> also allows you to go into <strong>Halq</strong> with 2 Tenyi (including <strong>Adhara</strong>) without committing into your Normal Summon. And <strong>Monk</strong> Also enables <strong>Vishuda</strong> 2nd Effect. <strong>Almiraj</strong> on the other hand is used for 1 card <strong>Halq</strong> with <strong>Sangan</strong>.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
The Biggest weakness of the Deck, is that it relies TOO MUCH on Halq and Auroradon, if they're negated, you're absolutely screwed. Which is why I play 2 Called by and 3 Crossout. Unless you go 2nd where you can somewhat Turbo into Yazi into Mare Mare and goes from there. It also lacks follow-up because once again, it relies on Halq and Auroradon. However, it's extremely extremely consistent, 2 monsters is all you need to do some Combos. If you go 2nd, you don't even need Baronne for Full Combo because Yazi can trigger its own Effect by his other Effect. Other than that, Deck can go into Halq without Normal Summon because of how many Extenders it has.

This Deck can still play under Maxx ""C"" simply by passing with 1-2 monsters and relies on your 15 Handtraps (yes that's the exact number of Handtraps I play). That's also the reason why I don't play Equalizer (Board Breakers) like Droplet or Lightning Storm, because if I just prevent my opponent from playing on their first turn, I don't need to negate anything on my turn (still loses to Control Decks lmao). I'm not too worried about Skill Drain because Vishuda can handle that.

Overall, I enjoy the Deck a lot. Seeing how Baronne is in the game and I can do Yazi Mare Mare Combo on turn 1 really excites me to make this Combo Deck. The Deck doesn't really have to be expensive, you can swap the staples with other staples that you have or even more Extenders, or just cut the Deck for consistency. I don't recommend crafting 3 Crossout because it may get Semi-Limited, or even Limited in the future (it's Limited on the OCG right now).

The next Combo Deck that I will post won't involve HalqDon Combo at all, I promise. I will post it after the Synchro Festival is over"

Different Prank-Kids name starter results in similar endboard,

Dropsies and Fansies: the best, Fansies can dump Prank-Kids Prank, and don't have to summon Rocksies (need 1 hand to banish then draw).

Lampsies: since we need to end on Dropsies, starting from Lampsies we would either have to summon Rocksies or unable to have Prank-Kids Prank.

Rocksies: not the best since we summoned Rocksies in the line."
