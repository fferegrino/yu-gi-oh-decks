To accomplish this goal you have your lady debug which you can use to search either micro coder or code generator/radiator to be able to easily summon your code talkers and also use the effects from using them to summon code talkers when they hit the grave. This is a blueprint considering I'm used to using salamangreat cyberse this was completely different even though it they are cyberse but different engines. Balancer lord is a very useful card to get an lvl 4 or lower out especially when used in conjuction with lady debug or widget kid even clock wyvern is good considering you get a token when summoned so you can go into your links for code talker or just straight into cyberse clock dragon. Micro coder/ code radiator/ generator are for summoning your code talkers  and getting there effects from grave if you have to send monster to grave I recommend dotscaper considering it summons itself from grave.  degrade buster/ cyberese white hat/ boot staggered are special summon/combo extenders while ram and rom claudia are for graveyard recovery. Haven't used prompthorn yet so can't comment on it. The spells are self explanatory. in your links code talk/ transcode talker is amazing so is transcode code talker powercode combo, security dragon remove problem monsters from field so is silent honor ark ( for indestructable monsters). Cynet storm and recovery is great cards when used in conjuction with links"

The primary reason for this is that it completely skips the idea of getting relinquished itself ritual summoned, as ritual spells tend to do little more than unnecessarily clog the deck.  With this deck, you rely on searches, draws, and sending the fusion pieces to grave and careful card play to stun your opponent on the second turn. With Dragonic Magic in the deck, it gets a nice buff for the first turn if you have Illusionist Magician in grave. As you can see, the card advantage tends to be very good since you can use Allure, Pot of Desires after sending some monsters to grave, and use Dark World Dealings with little downside (since your fusion spell fusions from the grave). If played carefully, you can get Thousand Restrict on the board as well, which can result in an almost total monster lock.  Play the cards carefully, and try to maintain 1 copy of each of Ill. Magician, Illusionist, and Relinquished in the grave or hand, if possible. Your opponent may try to bait you by throwing out an effect he/she doesn't need, so be wary of this."

I have a special deck for you all tonight and more awesome decks coming up in the near future I've been preparing and testing from scratch. This deck is Going Second Gouki Spyral. You always want to go second and this deck link spams like crazy going second. This deck mains a lot of handtraps so you can go second and prevent your opponent from making their plays and then go off hardcore on your turn. It's not that hard to predict your opponent's next draw if you know the meta well and know what deck they are playing since you are going second which is why I chose to put <a data-name=""Spyral Super Agent"">Spyral Super Agent</a> as an extender. Going into <a data-name=""Gouki Heel Ogre"">Gouki Heel Ogre</a> and then <a data-name=""Gouki The Giant Ogre"">Gouki The Giant Ogre</a> is insane turn two because Giant Ogre is immune to monster effects and can make his attack higher if his attack is altered. There is a cool combo with Divine Sword and Giant Ogre where if you equip him with Divine Sword since his attack is altered you can have him gain an additional 1000 attack points. The normal going second combo for this deck is to get out Isolde and then after using her effects, go into <a data-name=""Summon Sorceress"">Summon Sorceress</a> and go into a link 4 after using her effect, then proceed to OTK since you left your opponent with hardly any resources because of all the handtraps. In addition to this, I really like using <a data-name=""Autonomous Action Unit"">Autonomous Action Unit</a> in this deck as a tech because going second your opponent is most likely going to have a monster in their graveyard you can special summon and use. Have a great day everyone and safe travels!"

Like with my other decks, I made a script for calculating the odds - an 88.8% chance of summoning a Rank 10 XYZ first turn and an 82.0% chance of getting an Anger Knuckle alongside it. ...Not counting the card draws from all those Maxx Cs, of course.  &nbsp;  Playing the deck is pretty simple - first priority is summoning a Liebe (or Super Dora on turn 1), second priority is summoning an Anger Knuckle first. And always go first - it may seem counter-intuitive, but it's definitely a deck that benefits more from having a T1 than it loses from having your opponent get an extra card and attack.  Other combos to be aware of:  Anger Knuckle + Urgent Schedule: if Anger Knuckle is in the GY, you can set Schedule, then destroy it for a free Knuckle + Lv10 summoning.  Anger Knuckle/Urgent Schedule + Switchyard: summoning on your opponent's turn lets you activate Switchyard's summoning effect without the downside. It's usually two free extra summons.  Sky Strikers: the reason they're here is because Hornet Drones, using Kagari, can get you two Machine monsters out with a single card, which can then be linked into Anger Knuckle. If you can't tell yet, Anger Knuckle is essential for Trains.  &nbsp;  Last things to mention are: Qliphort Genius and Platinum Gadget are valid candidates, but there's no Extra Deck space. Shaddoll is worth running (instead of Pots Of Desires) but only if going second (which, again, don't if you have the chance). Seven Sins and Infinity Dark Utopic are the worst of the XYZs. Upstart Goblin is quite definitely worth running even if it does mean you can't beat your opponent with a single Liebe. If your opponent Maxx Cs you after you play a Lv10, it's usually worth combining into Super Dora or Liebe anyway. And Limiter Removal/Train Connection can be run by preference, I just prefer not to."

It's extremely high octane and is very reckless with lifepoints to achieve the ultimate goal: huggge life point damage while going second.  Kaiju is used to get any monsters that have free negation from turn 1. Red reboot is used to negate any troublesome traps that would get in the way of your reckless Rampage Dragon for the entire turn. Double copies of Limiter Removal and triple of Power Bond ensure that most turns you will be able to get a 4200 attack Rampage that gets to have 3 attacks. Pot of Desires is the perfect card to use in this reckless play style as the +1 is well worth it.  What makes Cyber decks special is their adaptability. There is always Infinity to play more conservatively and handtraps that serve as filler to keep your opponent from stacking the board on turn 1, making your OTK even more likely.  This deck is too powerful (like most meta decks) for casual play."

This build of Paleo Frogs utilizes cards that don't break the bank, while still performing at a reasonably consistent rate.  I've personally decided to cut the solemn brigade down to 3 cards, as although their power is invaluable, the fact that you can't chain paleos to them means that you'll be left without paleos on board to establish toad. The addition of Lilith fixes hands with low paleo counts and searches for most of the deck, and the addition of compulsory evacuation device means you can bounce pesky monsters resistant to destruction such as the thunder dragon fusions. Reckless greed is definitely a debatable option, and I personally go back and forth between taking out out and leaving it in."

I added in a few links so you can XYZ summon more than one monster. The main focus is to reuse the gagaga's over and over again from the graveyard using the effects of the monsters. This is my first deck I've ever built, so I hope it's halfway decent-  Possible Combo:  Gagaga Child + Any gagaga monster other than clerk and head. Summon Utopia Double, activate it's effect, summon Normal Utopia, Kaiser, The lightning, or beyond. (Kaiser is the best choice, because of the field spell.)

Even though neo space connector is probably a better card when not being used in it's archetypal deck, it's an amazing card in neos build letting you summon any neo spacian monster, most commonly aqua dolphin to make an Isolde and special summon shadow mist if you're going first. Or go into any of the other neos monsters to make something like air neos with air humming bird if your going second.  You'll mainly be going into Rainbow neos, and all the other 2 material neos fusions in your deck with the new Neos Fusion. Neos Fusion is probably the best piece of Neo spacian support released, as it has the effect that reads: "" If a Fusion Monster you control that lists “Elemental HERO Neos” as material would be destroyed by battle or card effect, or returned to the Extra Deck by its own effect, you can banish this card from your GY instead."" This is amazing,as the worst part of all neos fusions (outside of rainbow neos) is that they all send themselves back to the extra deck at the end phase. This completely bypasses that massive downside to all neos fusions and lets them stay on the field on your opponents turn, and also protects them from destruction. And it's not just one fusion summoned with Neos Fusion either nor does it limit you on just the 2 material neos fusions either. If you have a Neos Fusion in your graveyard and make a neos fusion monster with either Miracle Contact or Miracle Fusion, you can still use Neos Fusion's banish effect to protect them or keep them on the field.  Finally brave neos is a personal choice to add in the extra deck. While only boosting by 100 is a disappointment, 2500 on it's own isn't to shabby, and your bound to fave at least a few neo spacian or E-HERO monsters in your grave when it's summoned. But the big thing for me is when it destroys a monster by battle, you can add a card that lists ""Elemental Hero Neos"" in the card text letting you add one of the two fusion cards made for neo spacians. This lets you easily access Neos Fusion to go into Rainbow, or Air neos. Or even make Grand neos if there's a really big problem card on the field you just need to make go away. Maybe even just add Miracle Contact and make Nebua neos, get a mega ton of cards added to your hand and then banish every card on the field face down during the end phase. This makes me prefer having the Brave neos over a second Rainbow Neos, but I can understand if you want to replace the Brave Neos for a second Rainbow Neos."

Thank you so much guys!!! Since we reached both goals of getting 3 likes on the deck plus a comment I have made a Spyral Warrior Gumblar FTK deck from scratch. Although this deck can brick sometimes I've figured out while play testing that this is the best build I came up with after testing. You always want to go first with this deck if possible. The idea of using <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Summon Sorceress"">Summon Sorceress</a> to special summon <a data-name=""Gellenduo"">Gellenduo</a> with its effects negated off Beatrice to your opponents field and burning until your opponent dies on the first turn is really good. The FTK is not super consistent but it is a 2 card FTK and even if you don't draw the required pieces to pull off the FTK you still have the Spyral engine to play and go into Double Helix and or Gumblar. You can even Gumblar your opponent for 6 using Aqua Dolphin twice off the new <a data-name=""Neo Space Connector"">Neo Space Connector</a> that was just released in the Soul Fusion Special Edition recently. The way that this works is you Gumblar your opponent for 2 then another 2 off Aqua Dolphin since you can use its effect twice from Neo Space Connector and get out <a data-name=""SPYRAL Quik-Fix"">SPYRAL Quik-Fix</a> to go into <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and then get back Quik-Fix from the graveyard using either its effect or Big Red or Spyral Mission Rescue etc... Then when your opponent draws you can trigger Linkuriboh in grave to summon it using Quik-Fix as the tribute which triggers Gumblars effect for another 2 cards meaning your opponent has no cards in hand! Now I will explain how the actual FTK works using Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon. All you need in hand is <a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a> plus another Warrior monster. You can't have Malicious in your hand or you can't do it sadly since Mali got limited to 2. First special summon the Warrior monster in your hand then normal summon Vision HERO Vyon and use its effect to send Mali from deck to grave, then go into <a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights</a> and use her effect to get whatever Warrior monster you want from deck to hand except Mali or <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> since you need those  later. Then use Isolde's second effect to send 4 equip spells from your deck to grave except the D.D.R's you need those, and special summon Armageddon Knight from the deck, use his effect to send <a data-name=""Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> from your deck to the graveyard. Next use Destrudo's effect to special summon himself and choose to reduce his level by Armageddon Knight's and Synchro them into <a data-name=""Power Tool Dragon"">Power Tool Dragon</a>. Then use Power Tool Dragon's effect to get yourself D.D.R since there are 3 copies meaning you will automatically get it. After that you want to use <a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a> in your graveyard that you sent off Isolde's second effect to banish Armageddon Knight and another Warrior monster besides Mali and add it to your hand. This means you can use D.D.R to send Divine Sword to the grave as cost and special summon Armageddon Knight from the banish zone and use its effect again to send <a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros The Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros The Elite</a> and use its effect to add D.D.R back to your hand sending Armageddon Knight to the grave and special summoning Zephyros. Then you can loop Divine Sword and D.D.R again to banish Armageddon Knight and use D.D.R to send Divine Sword and special summon Armageddon Knight and use his effect to send <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a> and use his effect to send a card from your hand to the top of the deck to special summon himself and then use him and Zephyros to get out <a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of The Ice Barrier"">Brionac, Dragon of The Ice Barrier</a> to the other zone of Isolde. Then use Mali from grave to special summon another copy of himself from the deck and use Brionac and Mali to go into <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> and use her effect to send <a data-name=""Overtex Quatlus"">Overtex Quatlus</a> from deck to grave. Then use its effect to get <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a> from your deck to hand and use it to special summon the second Overtex Quatlus from your deck. Using it and Power Tool Dragon, go into Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon. After that link Armageddon Knight and Isolde to go into Summon Sorceress and use her second effect to target Beatrice and special summon Gellenduo from your deck to your opponents field negated. Then xyz <a data-name=""Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger"">Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger</a> on top of Beatrice and use him and Summon Sorceress to go into the new <a data-name=""Agave Dragon"">Agave Dragon</a> from Soul Fusion and use its effect to burn your opponent for 100 since you have a dragon type in your graveyard which will then start the infinite burn between Gellenduo and Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon since Gellenduo says it gets destroyed when that player takes any damage but its effects are negated so therefore it doesn't get destroyed which triggers Flare Metal Dragon since an opponent's card effect was activated and then the loop continues. There are just a ton of other cool combos you can do in general since the main Spyral monsters are Warrior type and you can use them to go into Isolde. Have fun and stay tuned for more decks! :)"
