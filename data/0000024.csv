This is a bit of a risky way to play Fur Hires where you sacrifice your first normal summon for Aleister but it works considering that you have 6 ways to revive your Fur Hires back to make their plays.

This deck runs a 2:2:2:2 Invoked ratio (2 Aleister, 2 Invocation, 2 Magical Meltdown, 2 Terraforming) and would require you to sacrifice your normal summon to get Aleister out to search Invocation, fusion summon with Invocation using Aleister on the field and one Fur Hire in your hand (any would do). Aleister banishes himself while the Fur Hire monster goes to the graveyard, though with Invocation's effect you can retrieve the banished Aleister and shuffle Invocation back into the deck. The real beauty lies with reviving the used Fur Hire monster with Mayhem Fur Hire/Monster Reborn/Soul Charge/Back to the Front/Call of the Haunted. Revive the Fur Hire monster, do what you can with your hand and bam you got field control. The best outcome that you could have on the field is a Mechaba, Rafale especially with an Effect Veiler in your hand giving you 3 monster negates all in all."

Cubics are an <em>awful</em> archetype by nature, and you will not only be dueling your opponent, but also your own deck.

As a die-hard fan of these things since they were even announced, the best advice I can give is that everything you hear about Cubics in those rare conversations where they are even brought up is wrong. Continue at your own risk.

The first thing to know about Cubics is that they need to never be the only thing at work. The only way they can truly succeed is with the assistance of other archetypes. In this guide, I will be showing you why that is and what you will need to do to achieve an <strong>amazingly </strong>consistent Cubic plus other deck.

Let’s look at the important monsters in a painless and brief way.

First up is Duza. An odd bird this one is, as it can fill any role you need it to. Stall, OTK, link material, Xyz spam, or fusion assistance...

He does it all.

In an ironic twist of fate, Duza is arguably the best added support for any archetype outside of a +2-draw card. Sends everything you could need for any situation. Karma for a +1, Unification for a pseudo stall engine or 3 additional link materials, or wave for even more stall potential in the form of mass cubic counters.

Always play him at 3.

Next is Crimson nova. Excellent protection against many, if not all non-link decks that don’t focus on backrow much, as well as ending the game when you’re done with the charade of giving your opponent a fair and fighting chance in the battle phase. Easy to summon and not a once per turn.  Can easily become a 10k hitter with a karma and a wave. Beware of honest players and the 3 people in the world that play magical cylinder.

Vijam is interesting because he serves either zero purpose in the deck one game or saves you from defeat in another. Very risky to play, but if your opponent doesn’t know what you’re playing, and they don’t have much removal, he is excellent to sit on face down to buy you some time.

The beast line is weird because you won’t be playing Garnex or Garoodia, just buster gundil. The reason for this is that their effects are rather weak, and in all honesty, you will not be destroying anything with a 1k or 2k hitter in this day and age, and they take too much to bring out with not much reward.

Now Buster Gundil, that’s a different story.

A 3k beater with 3 attacks is very strong and is only magnified by the access to Karma and Wave. In most cases, when you get him out, its better than Nova. If you are interrupted on your warpath you also have an excellent recovery mechanic that lets you summon 3 Cubics from your grave and add 1 Cubic <u>card</u> to your hand. Run 2 at least.

The Cubic king line is the same song and dance except for a few exceptions-

Guera Guile is the damn mvp for everything ever and is the hidden gem here.

From hand, it’s a Cowboy in the form of 800 increment burns and serves as a quick way to get your unification spam going. It can also serve as a good placeholder to get vijam out from the grave and get a Karma proc on the field in a pinch though battle. Remember, the effect CAN be activated after battle because monsters are destroyed AFTER the damage step.

Don’t run Vulcan Dragni. Just don’t.

Indoria is an odd one. In more ways than one, it is a worse Buster Gundil. Hard summoning will more than likely never be the right choice, since Guera Guile does the same amount of burn with 2 less monsters needing to be sent. You’ll only really use it when you can’t get Buster out with unification for the sent to graveyard effect. Usually only run 1.

And for the elephant in the room, Lets have a quick discussion about Nova Trinity.

At any point you could get him out, you should have won the game already. Let it be a sign that you are probably dragging things out beyond the capabilities of the Cubics themselves. The only real reason you should have him out is that you drew all 3 novas turn 1 and you have some sort of fusion card in hand. At that point, you’ve either won, or <em>lost very hard. </em>

The Spells and Traps

Cubic. Karma. 3.

No. More. Questions.

Cubic Wave is finicky because in certain hands it guarantees you the win, but if you aren’t running pure cubics, it can sometimes ruin an entire hand by not being a critical combo piece, or even drawing multiple when it can’t be used.

Unification of The Cubic Lords is your main engine piece in the graveyard if you plan on doing anything productive with your turns. When a cubic is <strong><em><u>removed from the field by any means</u></em></strong>, you get a special summon from deck (duza). Keep in mind, Xyz’s don’t count towards this, so if you plan on using duza as a material, remember that this will end your chain if you don’t have another cubic on board.

We don’t run cubic rebirth or mandala for the simple reason that by the time either of those would be useful (on the rare occasion) you are already either set up to win, or you messed up your combo so hard you deserve the loss.

Next Up, Tech Cards.

Foolish burial goods is first here because it’s essentially an archetype card. Run 3 and pray to your karmas for salvation in the coming turns.

Dark world dealings is the best compromise for a draw card that doesn’t neg you completely while also getting to have some sort of board / hand advantage. Great bait for ash when you send a karma when you don’t need to. It more often than not reveals what your opponent is playing so you can plan accordingly, and can ruin a lot of starting hands for the enemy.

Paired with a foolish burial goods, Sekka’s Light’s second effect can serve as a desperate way to get out of a sticky situation with a bad starting hand, but most of the time, the downside of drawing it heavily outweighs its upsides. Run 1 if you tend to have bad luck drawing your big guys.

Anyone who runs summoner monk is wrong. Do NOT run this card. It will brick you, and it’s just asking you to waste your normal summon with all these handtraps running around. Dark world dealings is all the discard you will ever need, and is always useful along with being beautifully clutch.

Anything else is up to you. Imperial iron wall is great for mega banish decks after you get your turn off, and the gem knight engine (with the clown brigade with the plant bugs) loves to nestle its way into the deck and give you extra duza and vijam normals.

The typical splash cubic engine should be around 27 to 31 cards-

3 x Nova

3 x Duza

3 x Vijam

2 to 3 x Buster Gundil

1 x Indiora

2 to 3 x Guera Guile

2 to 3 x Cubic Wave

3 x Cubic Karma

3 x Unification

3 x Foolish burial goods

2 to 3 x Dark world Dealings

This gives you space to add in almost any handtrap, counter trap, or other archetype in without issue.

To play them is pretty simple. Go for Duza at all times. If you get ashed, do your best to get a unification or vijam in the grave and get duza off the field with guera guile. Hold nova plays until you can win. The less time nova is on field, the better chance you have to win. There is only one real time nova can be chained off of and that’s the battle phase.

The best archetypes to mix with cubics I have found so far are-

Cubic zoo – use barrage to take out duza popping the uni and getting zoos, along with a brill fusion engine

Invoked Cubics – along with having every attribute besides water when you add the trash boys, gives you a quick way to summon trinity if you have all 3 nova in hand.

Cubic lightsworn – Minerva can be made with duza and Cubics love mill.

Cubic Knighmare – scapegoat and iblee give this deck some extra length into the extra deck

And the best so far is Cubic Timelords – Access to rank 10’s, constant gamestate manipulation, along with something to do with your non-existent backrow. Tribute duza’s for timelords and send time maiden with dark world dealings for some added salt.

Hope that if anyone was looking for a way to play these, I was able to help. Have fun!"

Anyways, after testing another variant of pure invoked, this is what I have come up with. Everyone thinks the new card that came out in the 2018 mega tins,  <a data-name=""Mudragon of The Swamp"">Mudragon of The Swamp</a> is useless. Well I think wrong! This card is amazing and it's an <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> target that allows you to pick any attribute you want and that then allows you to fuse into any Invoked fusion monster you want! Also <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, is of course just super broken in this deck. Going second is great because you can handtrap your opponent badly and then when it's your turn you can fusion summon and control them. And of course you have <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> to just OTK them easily if they have a bunch of defending monsters on board. This deck literally never bricks, but it can't beat every deck, it can for sure win against most tier 2 decks, but tier 1 can be pretty tough sometimes, but you still have a pretty good chance of winning if you play the deck right.

Examples of such cards are El Shaddoll Construct, Premature Buiral or Blackwing - Godu the Vague Shadow.

The deck's main focus is to put enough pressure on the board to have your opponent commit to their Extra Deck, making Shaddoll Fusion's strongest effect (Fusion Summoning from the Deck) live. To get to this point, you need 2 things: cards that put pressure on your opponent and ways to get to your Shaddoll Fusion faster.

To put pressure on your opponent, Subterror monsters are very adequate, since they're big, they're easy to summon, and they have powerful effects. The most common way of summoning your Subterrors is throught Subterror Nemesis Archer and Subterror Nemesis Warrior, so that's the reason why I'm using a Trinity on a 2nd copy of The Hidden City: It not only searches our Subterror Nemesis monsters, but it also helps triggering our Subterror Behemoth Monsters and its also has a pretty decent battle protection effect.

Since July 2018's list, Shaddoll Fusion has been co-limited, so that means that only 1 copy of the card can can be used, decreasing the deck's consistency. In order to circumvent this, and get to Shaddoll Fusion as soon as posible, I decided to use 2 trinities (yes, 10 more cards) to play another 2 copies of Shaddoll Hedgehog. This aslo helps with the late game, since having more Shaddoll monsters on the deck means you can resolve Shaddoll Fusion more times throught the duel.

The second co-limited card I choosed to play was terraforming, since it pairs well in a deck with so much Field Spells, and helped with the consistency of the LIGHT engine chosen to run in the deck. The A-B-C Union monsters: a flexible engine that is good both making Rank 4s and Links, while having a very powerful boss monster that is quite easy to summon.

That, paired with a lot of generic good cards and some FLIP support cards, is my approach on a deck that is currently considered one of the top decks of the format. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/alternate-format-analysis-trinity-introduction/"">If you are interested on the format, you can read an introduction to the format here!</a>"

Madolches are known for their shuffle into de- *<em>Heavy cough*</em>

Naturia Beast.

Just nat beast at this point if we're being real with eachother. While that is still a [<em>highly preferred and reccomended]</em> strategy, the deck has good synergy with the brilliant fusion engine and a few zoodiac cards, along with some sort of link spam mechanic that I pulled out of a dumpster behind the arby's on 4'th avenue.

Now some of you may be asking, <em>""How is this deck good or viable in any way, shape or form?"" ""The absolute hell were you thinking making a deck that doesn't have a sky striker engine like us true 1337 brain bois at table 5?""</em>

The simple answer is that it's not designed for playing in the current meta. Sure, if this sees the competitive side of things, it will need HEAVY adjustments, and still may be lucky to see the higher side of table 500, but most importantly, when not completely dead handing 3 brill fusion and 2 gem-norms, it is functional and will get a combo off uninterrupted, hopefully being unmanageable for the opponent.

As far as combos go, its pretty straightforward. Brilliant fusion is your gamemaker. if you get it off and seraphinite on the field, you've done your first turn correctly. Also you must be playing to the tune of 50 cent's ""Candy Shop"", the Julien Creance Remix on loop for 3 and a half hours beforehand. This is a critical step. Do remember your combo should look as such-
<ol>
 	<li>Scorpio - discard monster ( thousand blades to skip step four and glow up bulb to make nat beast later. never discard the clown without thou blade.)</li>
 	<li>Cobra - Grab brill fusion</li>
 	<li>xyz, into mx-sabre invoker</li>
 	<li>detach to summon thousand blades
OR</li>
 	<li>detatch to summon zoodiac from deck (rat/pass)</li>
 	<li>Make missus radiant (good dog) with mx+ any earth on your field</li>
 	<li>Use the damn brill fusion. (you've earned it)</li>
 	<li>Send the clown brigade (trick clown if you sent thousand blades at any point, or juggler if you didnt. banish juggler for hat boye immediately)</li>
 	<li>summon a hootcake by any means necessary (destroythechild.wav)</li>
 	<li>banish mx for the mailman. (nothing stops the mail)</li>
 	<li>grab the house for these homeless cakes. (don't activate until after saryuja)</li>
 	<li>make saryuja with missus, clown or hat, thousand blades, and mailman. draw 4, send 3. (in ygo, select radiant last)</li>
 	<li>you just did a 12 step combo with a 6 year old deck.</li>
</ol>
After that do what you need to do. natbeast.exe, knightmare removal, or even add trish to the deck. summon another mailman for madolche ticket and go for the madolche extra deck monsters just to be that much more of a <strong><em>Madouchebag.</em></strong> This deck will have a good few problems with interrupts but just make sure that you bait and space your combos accordingly. you can use the zoodiacsto extend your combos around missus radiant if you need a little bit of time to figure out if that trap is actually a sollemn.

Thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to look at my craft of garbomancy! My next decklist will be cubics and their still obscenely mediocre variant decks.

Remember to throw a cake at someone."

I'M OUT OF MY MEDS.,"Graydle: Suck your opponent's monsters.

Paleozoic: Engine for Toad and disruptions. Also sucking your opponent's cards.

Put two together and you get Grayzoic deck. A mash-up of both worlds. What's interesting is that this deck opens up a lot more options due to the existences of Tuner monsters in form of Slime and Slime JR. This allows a new branch in which Frog Paleozoic, in what I believe lacks: Raw Power and Exchange.

This deck is great for going first, but decent for going seconds. If your opponent doesn't have any cards for negation. You basically ram Graydle Snake, Eagle or Alligator(SEA) into the monsters and take control of them.

Since both Gray's and Paleo's (Banana&amp;Egg diet) effects activated mostly in the graveyard. Skill drain is a very good card to tech in. (TCG note: sorry for the loss. Since Skill Drain is limited in your side, it's not a good card since you can't search it.)

It's best for you to get Mistar Boy, Ophanibia and Toadally in one turn. This formation is very infamous. With Graydle, you had secondary options of pumping out Graydle Dragon and maybe Psy-Framelord Omega for more disruptions.

Anyways, here are some reasons of the number of cards in main deck:

1x Graydle Slime: You only need one. This card is great but with additional one more, you basically take away one slot from your 40-cards deck instead of another Paleozoic cards. Plus, his effects run on graveyard too. So there's Monster Reborn for you.

1x Toadally Awesome: I'm from OCG, and toad is limited. Plus, your deck isn't a Rank 2 spammer. So therefore, IMO, you don't need a second toad in your extra deck.

Eldonia instead of Canadia: Canadia is in the side deck because right now, a lot of monsters have targetting-immune effects. Link monsters can't even be set down. So I opted for boosting 500 ATK for you to ram SEA without getting damaged, a lot.

No Solemn cards: Wishes and Authority are self-explanatory but Strike and Warning are out because you need to conserve your LP for you to ram your SEA into your opponent's monsters. Remember, the highest ATK Graydle monster is only 1500.

PSY-FRAMELORD ZETA AND SHOOTING STAR DRAGON? : I had situations whereby I only had plays for a Level 7 Synchro, so this is an option. Shooting star for making White Aura Biphamet come out faster and easier.

No Needlefibre:
<ol>
 	<li>Your deck only had 4 tuners.</li>
 	<li>You need to save up 1-3 extra Extra Monster Deck Slot for it to work flawlessly.</li>
 	<li>Mistar boy is better for this deck.</li>
</ol>
Salvage instead of Surface: Salvage is better than Surface due to Salvage's tremendous recycling, a discard fodder for Dinomischus and JR'S effect only Proc on normal summoning effect.

Side deck options:
<ul>
 	<li>+1 Graydle Slime= -1 Gamaciel.</li>
 	<li>Canadia to replace with Eldonia if you want to flip down cards.</li>
 	<li>Surface to replace with Salvage if you want.</li>
 	<li>Black Moonlight to replace with Biphamet. Since you don't have Bihpamet, you can replace Shooting star with Clear Wing.</li>
</ul>

Lair is fun. This deck has surprisingly never bricked. Your opponent won't what hit them. First they're seeing only the cards of,"Lilith searches disruptive traps, Ahrima searches Lair/draws/searches Diabolos. Lair is great because each time your tribute an opponent's monster for an effect, you go +1 in card advantage. Diabolos isn't a major part of this strategy but he's a fine boss monster. Activate a trap to summon Multifaker, special Silquiand bounce. Meluseek + backrow wins games on their own. Marionetter is an okay starting normal summon if you need more traps or just a body on the field. Pot of Duality get you monsters when you have all backrow and backrow when you have a ll monsters, reasoning is good because you have all normal summons in the main deck. Called to the Grave for those pesky ghost girls. Mind Crush to laugh in their face when your opponent searches for something. Enjoy!"

Also, by Special Summoning a Link monster either from the Extra Deck or GY you can activate Cynet Regression to destroy 1 card on the field and also draw 1 card.

You can bring two monsters from the GY when a Cyberse Link monster is destroyed by using both Salvagent Driver's effect and Cynet Recovery's effect. This way you can also bring RAM Clouder and in the next turn you can tribute it to bring Transcode Talker and bring another Cyberse Link-3 or lower with Transcode Talker's effect.

Transcode Talker + Crusadia Equimax = Target protection and Crusadia Equimax with 4800 ATK

Transcode Talker + Excode Talker = Target protection for both, destroy protection for Transcode and Transcode Talker with 3300 ATK.

Transcode Talker + Pentestag = Target protection + Piercing damage

Since this Deck have only Cyberse monsters, you can put Rivalry Warlords if your opponent runs a deck with a lot of different types. If you like Knightmare cards, this Deck takes benefit of them as well.

&nbsp;

Pros:
<ul>
 	<li>Very fun, since it use cards from the main protagonist of the new anime series.</li>
 	<li>Great recovery</li>
 	<li>Great targeting protection</li>
 	<li>Somewhat good draw power (Cynet Regress + Pot of Desires [Side Deck])</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
 	<li>Lack of hand traps</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<hr />

&nbsp;

Some cards I tried to find a space for them but couldn't:
<ul>
 	<li>Dotscaper, Balancer Lord and Flame Bufferlo together with Cynet Backdoor (or World Legacy Clash)</li>
 	<li>Sea Archiver that goes well with Link-Infra Flier and Space Insulator</li>
 	<li>Underclock Taker</li>
 	<li>Link Disciple and Link Devotee that goes well with Sea Archiver + Datacorn combo to bring 2 Link-2 (commonly Flame Administrator + Honeybot).</li>
</ul>
This Deck does not contain the following cards because they were only released in OCG:
<ul>
 	<li>Latency</li>
 	<li>Swap Cleric</li>
 	<li>Cyberse Converter</li>
 	<li>Elphase</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<hr />

Give me your suggestions, what you would change to make this Deck better or what way do you play with Cyberse monsters?

Rate this deck if it helped you. Thanks in advance!"

It has other powerful dragons to finish off your opponent in case Zarc is too difficult or failed..

Quintet Magician can be summoned very easy with this deck, this card is really dam powerful and if you play right, you can get both Zarc and Quintet out... its fun..

Odd-Eyes Rebellion and Odd-Eyes Raging dragon can be summoned as well.. I mean seriously why not ... OTK :)

Very good combo to do... Dump the Odd-eyes revolution into the GY, very easy.. And summon the Supreme King Servant Venom... This combo will send ALL cards exempt from the hand to the deck, then, you attack directly with half of your opponents life points + 2800... hehe just try it..

Deck strategy is built around Subterror monsters effects like:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Subterror Guru</strong> is one of the best cards, it can block an enemy's monster effect or attack by turning himself and the selected monster in face-down def position (even in the opponent turn if you control another Subterror <strong>card</strong>);</li>
 	<li><strong>Subterror Nemesis Archer </strong>when destroyed and sent to the GY permits to special summon a Subterror monster from the deck;</li>
</ul>
This two monsters are really good either for atk and def purposes;

In the spell/trap cards department we have:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Subterror Cave Clash </strong>adds a good amount of atk and def to your monsters</li>
 	<li><strong>The hidden city</strong>, a field spell card that can change the battle position of your dear monsters negating one attack from your opponent</li>
 	<li><strong>Subterror final battle</strong>, a trap card with multiple effect that provides a big amount of different strategies (gotta love it)</li>
</ul>
Special guest:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Subterror fiendess</strong> (that can be used as a trap from the hand) negates the sctivations of effects while special summoning a monster froma your hand or GY</li>

This deck destroys your opponent going second and is mean't to go second, it can go first and you can do cool like combos like make <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a> and then put <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> under it. The way to do that is to have <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>, <a data-name=""Tour Guide from the Underworld"">Tour Guide from the Underworld</a>, or <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a> in your starting hand. Then after you those via starting hand or <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> then go into <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a> using Fiendish Rhino Warrior and another Burning Abyss monster or any level three monster or using Tour Guide and Graff. Then use Dante's effect to send Graff to grave to mill three and use Graff's effect to special summon <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> from your deck. After that, go into either one of the link two Knightmare's and use Cir's effect to special summon Dante and Dante's effect to add back Cir to your hand, then go into Knightmare Mermaid using the link two Knightmare underneath Dante and send Cir to the graveyard to put Beatrice under Mermaid! Also, going second being able to otk is quite easy because you can go into Dante first or any rank three to get rid of your opponent's monsters, or use <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>, etc... and then use the Danger! cards in your hand like <a data-name=""Danger! Bigfoot!"">Danger! Bigfoot!</a> to otk your opponent. Enjoy!"

Without the Firewall combo.,"This is a Mermail deck that doesn't include the Firewall combo.

I included ""Fishborg Launcher"" and ""Fishborg Archer"" for Synchro plays and use Exodius to get the discarded cards back into the deck. Hand Traps were completely removed since Update 1, because of the Fishborg cards. Maybe i will include the Water Elemental Lord as soon as i can get the card.

09-25-2018 Update 3:

Main Deck: 1x ""Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord"" was added. 1x ""Mermail Abyssdine"" was added. 2x ""Called by the grave"" was added. 1x ""Moray of greed"" was removed. 1x ""Dark Hole"" was moved from the Side Deck into the Main Deck. 2x ""Solemn Strike"" added. 1x ""Solemn Judgment"" removed.

Side Deck: 1x ""Gamaciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"" was moved from th Main Deck into the Side Deck. ""Fishborg Archer"" was removed. ""Mare Mare"" was moved from the Main deck into the side deck. ""Mermail Abyssturge"" was moved from the Main Deck into the side Deck. 1 copy of ""Atlantean Marksman"" was moved from the Main Deck into the Side Deck. 1x ""moray of greed"" was moved from the main Deck into the Side Deck. 1x ""Abyss-squall""added. ""Mermail Abyssleed"" was removed.

It is possible that i changed something else, but i have no clue what it was."

Zones (for board placement):
EM         EM

M    M    M     M    M

---back row ---

Combo: Requires 1 Gouki + 1 other card that can get you to Isolde, or 2 level 3s
1.) Get to Isolde; you can do this through 2 level 3's --&gt; going into invoker --&gt; summoning suprex --&gt; going into Isolde; or by having a monster that can SS + one gouki.

Board Placement:
Isolde --&gt; goes in right extra monster zone

2.) You Link your 1 Gouki + other card/Invoker --&gt; go into Isolde; CL 1 Gouki add of GY eff (add headbatt off of this Gouki's eff), CL 2 Isolde (add that Gouki that just hit the Grave, off isolde).

3.) Dump Phoenix Blade, or Moon Mirror (if you draw Phoenix Blade), and SS octostretch from your Deck. Then activate Headbatt's eff in your hand --&gt; discarding the Gouki you added off isolde and SS Headbatt to the field next to octostretch. Then special summon knightmare cerberus (you do not need phoenix blade in hand at this point) using octostretch + headbatt --&gt; CL 1 Gouki #1, CL 2 Gouki #2 (doesn't matter the order) --&gt; add a Gouki you haven't used this turn (so in this case it can't be headbatt/octostretch/gouki used to get into Isolde) and Gouki rematch.

Board placement:
Knightmare Cerberus, since Isolde is in the right monster zone, should be summoned to the Left Downward Zone of Isolde.

4.) Activate rematch, targeting headbatt and octostretch to Summon them to the field.
5.) Special Summon Firewall dragon to the left of Cerberus (its arrows point up to an empty spot and left, the only zone firewall should be going in), using Isolde + Octostretch + Headbatt (<em>remember that octostretch and headbatt were SS from grave by the effect of Gouki Rematch</em>).
6. Now add the phoenix blade to your hand (if it was in your GY) by banishing 2 warriors (Isolde is fine to banish at this point, but <strong>DO NOT</strong> banish octostretch)

Board Placement:
In the spot that is left to Cerberus you have summoned Firewall, this zone is right underneath the Leftmost Extra monster zone (you had used the rightmost to SS Isolde).

7. Special Summon Knightmare Mermaid, using Knightmare Cerberus, above firewall dragon in the Leftmost Extra monster zone --&gt; activating Mermaid as CL 1 and Firewall as CL2 (if you mess this up, combo dies). For CL1, discard phoenix blade --&gt; SS Iblee (this Special Summon happens after Firewall's effect resolves), CL2 (Firwall Eff) Special Summon the Gouki you had added when you made Knightmare Cerberus back in Step 3.

Board Placement:
Knightmare Mermaid in leftmost extra monster zone, above firewall dragon, with knightmare corruptor iblee &amp; random gouki being on your side of the field.

8. Add back the Phoenix blade to your hand (banish 2 warriors from the GY, <strong>NOT</strong> octostretch) and then Special Summon Knightmare Goblin to the right of firewall (in the middle main monster zone) activating Firewall Dragon as Chain Link 1, the Gouki that hits the GY's eff as Chain Link 2, and Knightmare Goblin as Chain Link 3 (don't use iblee's effect just yet). CL 3 resolves first --&gt; discard phoenix blade, draw 1 (now you can normal summon), CL2 resolves next --&gt; add another Gouki that you have not used this turn (probably riscorpio or bearhug), CL1 resolves --&gt; Special Summon the gouki you just added to the leftmost main monster zone (Left of Firewall Dragon).

9. Up until this point we have not activated Firewall Dragon's bounce effect; now that you have Knightmare Mermaid up top, and Knightmare Goblin to the right of Firewall Dragon - you are going to activate the bounce effect, adding 2 cards to your hand. You will add octostretch and iblee from your GY to your hand.

Board Placement:
Leftmost extra monster zone - Knightmare mermaid, underneath Mermaid is Firewall Dragon, to the left of firewall dragon is the gouki you last summoned, and to the right of Firewall Dragon is Knightmare Goblin.

10. With that extra normal summon, you're going to Normal Summon iblee to the only zone Goblin has open (it's rightmost zone, which is directly under the rightmost extra monster zone) --&gt; this triggers Iblee's effect --&gt; allowing you to summon Knightmare Cerberus to the rightmost main monster zone (next to Iblee).

11. Using the Gouki you had summoned off firewall + iblee --&gt; you're going to go into your 2nd Knightmare Cerberus (next to knightmare goblin); using that gouki's effect to add another Gouki card (add one more gouki monster that hasn't been used or isn't the gouki you added off isolde/octostretch), and using Iblee's effect to special summon herself to your opponent's field. Firewall's effect will trigger allowing you to summon 1 card from your hand.

12. Use Firewall's effect to summon octostretch from hand (the one you bounced from the grave) to make linkuriboh above Knightmare Cerberus. At this point you have achieved the extra link, however each card can be desroyed by battle; so you use firewall's effect for the last time to summon the last gouki you added (from your hand) to the field. Using this gouki + firewall --&gt; you go into Knightmare Phoenix, right under mermaid and to the left of goblin (placing it where firewall just was).

Naturia Beast Turbo Sekka's Light 2018 (Going Second) (Post Cybernetic Horizon),"Ready for a ""Dangerous!"" deck? Haha, well here it is. The new Danger! archetype mixed with Burning Abyss plus the Naturia Beast Turbo engine starring <a data-name=""Elephun"">Elephun</a>! This deck did really well in testing and is meant to go second with. You otk your opponent very quickly with monsters like <a data-name=""Danger! Bigfoot!"">Danger! Bigfoot!</a> and Black Luster Soldier. There are other special techs I put in like <a data-name=""Fabled Soulkius"">Fabled Soulkius</a> which allows you to send two cards from your hand to the graveyard to special summon itself and it's a 2200 beater so it's really good. In testing I hardly bricked and the deck is really amazing. The deck also has <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> since the deck is all monsters which allows for more draw power and more otking. If your forced to go first though and you have Rescue Cat in your hand, it's a good idea to summon it and use it's effect to get out Elephun and <a data-name=""Gallis The Star Beast"">Gallis The Star Beast</a> to go into <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> and stop your opponent from playing their spells. Of course just like in my other 60 card Burning Abyss decks I always have that one copy of <a data-name=""Tour Bus From The Underworld"">Tour Bus From The Underworld</a> because it can shuffle back <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> back into the extra deck allowing you to summon it again.
