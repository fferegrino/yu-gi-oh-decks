This version of the <em>Exodia</em> <em>deck</em> focuses on drawing tons of cards, stunning the opponents destroying &amp; negating everything they play until we get the 5 pieces in hand. <h4>Strategy:</h4> The deck must be exactly 40 cards in order not to lower the probability to draw the 5 pieces. The only monsters we play have the ability to retrieve the 5 pieces of <em>Exodia</em>, their effect is triggered in the graveyard so they aren't affected by Skill Drain.  We want to buy ourselves some time with cards such as <a data-name=""One Day of Peace"">One Day of Peace</a>, <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> and <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> (which triggers our monsters when hits them). <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> should create problems for the opponents that will almost certainly rely on their monsters' effects.  For our protection we have <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> and <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, but also <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> works well in disrupting the opponents' plans during their turn.  <a data-name=""Reckless Greed"">Reckless Greed</a> must not be used until you can activate 2 or 3 simultaneously (to skip only 2 draw phases, but drawing 4 or 6 cards) or, alternatively, in desperate situations.  <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> could be sided-out if the opponent doesn't make a big usage of monster effects in our turn. <h4>Possible variations:</h4> Probably more cards to defend from attacks as <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a> could be needed (some testing is required to clarify). In case, could remove 1/2x <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> and/or 1x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>.  A 3rd <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> could fit well in the deck if needed.  The 3x <a data-name=""Reckless Greed"">Reckless Greed</a> could be too greedy and may be substituted with 2/3x <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> in order to have some further protection, especially from cards not triggering <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a>. The remaining 1/2x slots could be taken by 1x <a data-name=""Obliterate!!!"">Obliterate!!!</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu"">Legacy of Yata-Garasu</a> (or <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a>) or 1x <a data-name=""Wall of Revealing Light"">Wall of Revealing Light</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>.  Alternatively, instead of using 3x <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> we can afford one more monster, 3x <a data-name=""Cyber Valley"">Cyber Valley</a>, and substitute 2x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> with 2x good defending cards as <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a>.  One more version could be using cards as <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> and <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a> to block the opponent (maybe substituting <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and some <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>). <h4>Side Deck:</h4> - <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> is the most valid spell we kept outside the deck, so it might be added if necessary to defend more - <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> / <a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a> is a desperate partial remedy in case the opponent manages to make us discard some pieces - <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>, <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> in case needed depending on the opponent - <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a> and <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a> in case you want to choose the strategy to flood the opponent field with monsters and stop some combos - <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> in case the opponent makes use of specific critical cards to be stopped <h4>Extra Deck:</h4> The only used monster is <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> thanks to <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a>, but we need it to have 15 cards anyways for the <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>. In case of suggestions and better ideas of monsters that can be actually used in specific situations, please leave a comment and let me know. <h4>A few <strong>extra useful cards</strong>:</h4> <em>Monsters</em>: <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">- </a><a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> (not awesome since only prevents direct attacks, but still ends the battle phase from the hand) - <a data-name=""Swift Scarecrow"">Swift Scarecrow</a> - <a data-name=""Crystal Seer"">Crystal Seer</a> (nice to cycle through the deck fast, but it's a problem with Skill Drain) - <a data-name=""Cyber Valley"">Cyber Valley</a> (very strong, but it's a problem with Skill Drain)  <em>Spells</em>: - <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a> - <a data-name=""Draw of Fate"">Draw of Fate</a> - <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> - <a data-name=""Field Barrier"">Field Barrier</a> - <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> - <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a> (one of the best alternatives to <a data-name=""Reload"">Reload</a>, <a data-name=""Card Trader"">Card Trader</a>, and <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> since you can choose which cards to recycle, but still it's a -1 in hand)  <em>Traps</em>: - <a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu"">Legacy of Yata-Garasu</a> - <a data-name=""Good Goblin Housekeeping"">Good Goblin Housekeeping</a><a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu""> </a>- <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a> - <a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a> (good to gain 1 turn, prevents all possible attacks risks) - <a data-name=""Dimensional Prison"">Dimensional Prison</a> (only stops 1 attack) - <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> - <a data-name=""Wall of Revealing Light"">Wall of Revealing Light</a> - <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick - </a><a data-name=""Time Seal"">Time Seal</a>  <em>Please leave some comments to let me know what you think and take a look at my other decks!</em>"

With the downfall of the dragons, however, most are led to believe that this archetype stands no chance in today's dueling world. <strong>WELL NO MORE!</strong> This deck can compete with the rest of them, though it doesn't need most of the other support cards - unless you're playing pure. But this deck is combo-based and is keen on Special Summoning as well as searching. You can even play around Nibiru, as you can summon Crystal Wing on the fifth summon (Normal Summon <span>The White Stone of Legend</span>, Special Summon <span>Destrudo</span>, Synchro into <span>Black Rose Moonlight</span>, Use world legacy Guardragon to bring back <span>The White Stone of Legend</span>, then make the <span>Crystal Wing</span>). You can even get spicier with your combos if you get the chance, and even end the game with a classic <span>Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.</span>"

And look at that it makes Orcust much more playable. What I want to show you is just the prototype since I don't know the correct ratios yet and I am also considering to go through other engines as well, just as dagda and souls.  The good thing right now is that halq is still legal, so we can use jet as a 1 card halq. But what do we do with halq? It's simple we get bombard and use it and halq to go into gala, then we can shuffle the Jet back and get an Orcust sp/tr. Now if we have an Orcust in hand we can extend further since we have bombard in gy. We also can play brave since we don't need our normal summon anymore, so say goodbye to bricky scrap golem combos.  Btw we can also use Small World, everything we need is a level 3 monster, then we use Terrortop as a bridge and get access to either Jet or Girsu aka the best cards in the deck.  I see alot of potential here and think that Orcust might be a rogue deck if not even a T2 deck. It just needs abit more testing."

So you should read this decklist.","Abyss Actors are my favorite deck, and they have been getting some good placements recently... well they've been getting any placements, and thats about all I can wish for. The main strategy of abyss actors is going second, as their best cards like comic relief only really work going second.  If you are going second the basic plan is ""RISE OF THE ABYSS KING TURBO"", the combos you can do are more complicated than this, but its good to keep that idea in mind, because it really is the best card in the deck.  Now, onto the questions you may have: ""Why the Mystic Mine in the main, while the going first cards to support it are in the side."" There are two reasons, 90% of the time you will be going second the first game, so you don't need your going first cards. The second reason is that it allows you to play around hand traps going second. Say your opponent has a wide board with cards left in the hand. You play mine and it either chews through a spell negate, or it stops them from playing any effects. Then you can do all your combos staying under their cards, and when you are ready to attack, you play RISE OF THE ABYSS KING to destroy your own mine and their monsters. And from that point you'll probably win. If they end their turn on one or two monsters then you can instead side it out for the dark ruler. I would do droplets but those are expensive.  ""What do I do going first"" Side in everything, summon bagooska, summon sloth, set demise and solemn. Then hope they can't beat that. Else, go to game three.  ""Why are you running evil heel, he's not that good and another level 4 would probably be better to help with going into bagooska."" True, however Evil Heel is my boyfriend and I love him, so I am going to run him.  ""Why the change of heart"" It just got unbanned and its a funny going second card, arguably just using comic relief is better, but it will at least chew through a negate, so whatever.  ""Why should I play this deck"" It's a great deck, and it literally costs like $40ish dollars to build, also the max rarity cards are cheap, so you can look at shiny cardboard for cheap. Also Evil heel is really hot and you should play a deck with him in it. There are literally zero problems with this deck.  ""Why not just play metalfoes for a cheap pend deck"" It doesn't have evil heel in it.  &nbsp;  So as you can see there are exactly zero problems with this deck, so you should totally play it."

The Ghost Ogres are probably better as Ash, as it's another zombie to trigger Balerdroch, but unless Ash prices drop drastically, I will not be owning any.

To do this your main goal is to get into <em>Junk Speeder</em> so you can get multiple synchrons on the field so you can go into your bigger monsters such as <em>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</em>, <em>Chaos Ruler</em>, <em>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</em> (which you go to off of <em>J</em><em>et Synchron</em> and <em>Chaos Ruler</em>), and <em>Baronne De Fleur.</em>  ALTERNATIVE CHOICES IN THE DECK:  <em>Baronne De Fleur</em> can be swapped for <em>F.A. Dawn Dragster</em>  If the format requires it, you can switch <em>Stardust Charge Warrior</em> for either <em>Brionic, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier</em> or <em>Infernity Doom Archfiend</em>. This should only be done if the format requires it as the extra draws are very important in the deck.  EXPLAINING THE DECK:  The Ascator engine is a free <em>Chaos Ruler</em> which helps to make a target for <em>Junk Synchron</em>.  <em>Junk Converter</em> is used primarily to get either <em>Junk Synchron</em> or <em>Stardust Synchron</em>.  WE DO NOT PLAY TUNING. WE DO NOT NEED IT. Instead, We Use <em>Synchro Overtake</em>. With <em>Synchro Overtake </em>you target the <em>Junk Warrior</em> in your Extra Deck to either add to hand OR SPECIAL SUMMON <em>Junk Synchron</em>. Please note that if you special summon <em>Junk Synchron</em>, it will not get its effect to special a level 2 from grave.  The <em>Stardust Synchron</em> engine is a free level 8 and more. It is a pretty self-explanatory engine but has high value.  The 3 <em>Emergency Teleportation</em> is huge in this deck. It allows for extended plays and more negates. In this deck, I run <em>Psychic Ace</em>, <em>Psychic Tracker</em>, and <em>Ghost Ogre</em> as targets for <em>Emergency</em> Teleportation. I find that I usually lack non-tuners, but if you feel you need more you can swap the <em>Psychic Tracker </em>for <em>Psychic Wheeleder</em>.  <em>Accel Synchron</em> takes a page out of chrystron's book and allows you to synchro summon during your opponent's turn. This is a great way to disrupt them. Because of this immense utility, you should try and keep <em>Accel Synchron</em> and one other level 5 monster on the field so you can synchro summon into <em>Satellite Warrior</em> during your opponent's turn. <em>Satellite Warrior</em> lets you essentially clear your opponent's board, gaining attack for each card it destroys."

This deck was a little challenging to create because a lot of her new support relies on Exhange Of The Spirit and the new cards that support it.  In order for this to work correctly I felt I had to combine Key Cards that she used against Kaiba in Battle City during season 2 of Yugioh Duel Monsters.

Now, you have two route depending on your hand and matchup, against light based opponent, you don't want to banish adhara since you want to use baxia eff to destroy monk of the tenyi and SS adhara. route 1: banish Adhara to add Ashuna from banish, chixiao would search for Mo Ye or Longyuan, Mo Ye will reveal ashuna to synchro lv 8 (baxia or drago berserker of tenyi) or longyuan would discard ashuna to become chengying. route 2: Chixiao search for Taia (no wyrm or swordsoul) or Mo Ye (have another wyrm / swordsoul card), synchro lv 8 baxia then destroy monk of the tenyi to SS adhara from GY, synchro 9 chaofeng lock light  4 card: the combo is pretty similar with 2 card Mo Ye, but you start with Longyuan first to synchro baronne to avoid nibiru, then you will synchro Baronne, then lv 8 chixiao, alternatively you can do this with taia for three hand combo.  Archnemeses Protos: generally not first turn card, except you know you will fight against PK or dark attribute based deck, also a good counter for DPE since it could not be destroyed, would destroy DPE and lock DPE from special summoning. However you either hard draw or have wyrm synchro still on the field to actually search this card with swordsoul emergence. You might tempted to destroy your own chixiao if you know you will fight against light attribute based deck."

Take note of the side deck when playing this deck. Since you'll be playing different decks, you can customize the deck to what is mostly being played in the current meta. Play test to find what ratios suits you best. You can push the deck to 45, but I suggest manipulating the ratios in the deck to make more room for more cards.  https://youtu.be/OGUKQ3Kx2Do"

Once you have made GD send Zephyros to the GY with his effect. Bounce the Ravine to summon Zephyros and make Romulus, with Romulus search Glow. Glow allows you to get Mystletainn and summon an equipped Dragunity to the field. The monster that you will be equipping with Mystletainn is GD. Since he's not a HOPT you will use him again and summon Baby Roc. Now with Mystletainn and GD XYZ into Atum and summon RedMD from the deck (it's crucial to detach GD from Atum so you can summon him again with newly summoned RedMD). Your field should now contain Atum (preferably in EMZ), RedMD, Baby Roc, and Gae Dearg. If you have a Dragon/Winged Beast in hand, use GD once more to search Stormwinds. Link into Spheres with RedMD and Atum and Synchro into Savage with the leftover monsters. Lastly normal summon Stormwinds.  On your opponent's turn if your Stormwinds is outed before the Battle Phase, immediately use Spheres to bounce something and summon Drago from deck to get another floodgate live on the field.  <strong>Strengths, weaknesses and other comments:</strong>  The biggest strength of this deck is that it can find pretty much every single card in its deck and the main combo is very consistent so you can often end on Spheres Savage Stormwinds. The biggest weakness is of course Nibiru which is controllable with the Adventure engine. Adventure does so much for the deck, not only does it get you into an Omni-negation but Fateful Adventure lets you discard cards that you want in the GY. Because you run Ravine, Remus, Rite of Aramesir, Gold Sarc, and more, Gamma is often live on your first turn.  &nbsp;"

Makes all dinos on the field immune during the Main Phase that you use this (A lot of people don't notice). If the effect from the hand resolves, dinos on field can't get Ash'd, Nibiru'd, or any other typical prevention effect. Normal combo is to send to grave, banish and summon <a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a> and combo from there.  <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> - One of the main cards, can make a decent combo alone. Searches any dino from deck. Normal summon then search <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a> and go from there.

I suggest you only run Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring since you'll mainly wanna go first with this one. The deck runs two combos depending on whether or not you have Aleister the Invoker with another fusion spell.

Gaia is a deck that centers around fusing into one of your Gaia the Dragon Champion variants for a swift OTK. The way the deck achieves this is all about grabbing both <a data-name=""Gaia the Magical Knight"">Gaia the Magical Knight</a> and <a data-name=""Curse of Dragon, The Cursed Dragon"">Curse of Dragon, The Cursed Dragon</a> (I can never get over that name. It's so stupid) Gaia summons itself and specials Cursed Dragon to search for your <a data-name=""Spiral Fusion"">Spiral Fusion</a>, and under the right conditions, you will win the game from there. Basically you go for <a data-name=""Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons"">Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons</a> and oftentimes it's enough for lethal. <a data-name=""Galloping Gaia"">Galloping Gaia</a> and <a data-name=""Artillery Catapult Turtle"">Artillery Catapult Turtle</a> search for either of the two resources needed, but <a data-name=""Gateway To Chaos"">Gateway To Chaos</a> only searches Gaia.

This is what I personally think is the best list you can run atm for Swordsoul, I also think you could cut imperm for Effect Veiler if you need to, also helps it's a tuner. The strategy of the deck is simple, going first you want to set up negates for your opponent to deal with as well as your handtraps to disrupt their plays. On the draw you want to break their boards with our 10000 extenders and Baxia. Sending cards back to the deck is devastating and we are here for it."

For my old list, see <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/branded-tearalaments/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/branded-tearalaments/</a></span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The pseudo-starters</strong> - <span>The reason why I'm starting with these is because one, they're the starters that you'd normally wouldn't want to Normal Summon. Two, they're the starters that can Special Summon themselves anyway (conditional or not) which saves your Normal Summon. And three, they're either easy access to a Baronne De Fleur and/or hand trap baits for your True Normal Summons. They are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Visas Starfrost&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Visas Starfrost</strong></a> - <span>The Level 6 Tuner of the Deck that gives you access to <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a>. He and Tearalaments Shaylen, with a good set of mills can actually potentially lead to full combo. His effect to Special Summon himself destroys a monster as part of the effect, so it triggers all of your Tearalaments monsters and your Despian Tragedy to search.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Shaylen&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Shaylen</strong></a> - <span>The other main pseudo-starter/extender for the Deck, which can Special Summon herself during the Main Phase once per turn, then allows you to mill the top 3 cards of your Deck. Her being Level 4 is relevant since she can also give you access to Baronne De Fleur.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Springans Kitt&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Springans Kitt</strong></a> -</span> She's here to mainly search Branded Lost upon getting Normal or Special Summoned, also to recover any of your banished ""Branded"" Spells/Traps, mainly <a data-name=""Branded Retribution"">Branded Retribution</a>. Also, you'd much rather want to see her in your opening hand than Fallen of Albaz, which I've cut down to 1 for this reason.</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Meiru&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Meiru</strong></a> - <span>She's the other Normal Summon for Tearalaments, but in this list she's only a one of for the purposes of Fusion climbing to <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido-heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido-heart</a>.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>• <strong>The True Normal Summon starters</strong> - <span>The reason these two are called ""True Normal Summon starters"" is because first of all, you most definitely do not want to start off your combo with them most of the time and second, as much as possible, these two are the ones that you'd want to Normal Summon for the following reason(s):</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Aluber the Jester of Despia&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Aluber the Jester of Despia</strong></a> - <span>He's usually gonna be your <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> target, but unlike the pseudo-starters, you'd actually want to Normal Summon him over them. Also this time, you're not gonna be focusing too much on the <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> search to set up for <a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade</a>, but instead we're almost always going to search for the true star of this list, <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> for one simple reason: <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido-heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido-heart</a> is a Level 9 Fusion Monster that it can bring back from the GY..</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Tearalaments Reinoheart"">Tearalaments Reinoheart</a></strong> - <span>Him being at 3 have two main reasons: First, is that it's important that we always have access to his name since he's a vital piece to summoning <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido-heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido-heart</a> and secondly, his effect to Special Summon himself, unlike Aluber, also triggers his effect to send another ""Tearalaments"" monster to the GY, except a copy of himself. Him getting banished by his own effect isn't actually a detriment since the Branded engine has an excellent grind game and resource recycling when Fusion Summoning because of <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a>.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Spells/Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Lost"">Branded Lost</a></strong> - <span>The reason why I'm playing more of this is because this list has a LOT of effects that Fusion Summon, and you want them to resolve as much as possible. Without it, this list would be significantly weaker and more vulnerable to <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Tearalaments Crime"">Tearalaments Crime</a></strong> - <span>It's one of your couple of ways of recovering your banished ""Tearalaments"" monsters, mainly <a data-name=""Tearalaments Reinoheart"">Tearalaments Reinoheart</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></span>  <span>Well, it's not really that different to my old Branded Tearalaments list, only did a couple few adjustments but then, that's what testing is for. Also, the fact that Baronne De Fleur can recycle herself to bring out an outed <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> in your GY is just too spicy for me to pass up on. (Also, this one's a bit short because at the time that I was writing this guide, I have a migraine/headache so, yeah.) This was a fun list to test because its crucial weakness is also one of its strengths, the fact that it's heavily reliant on good mills off the top of your Deck to pop off, which makes it also harder to telegraph unless you play the Deck yourself as well. I cannot wait for Tearalaments to get their own dedicated archetypal Fusion Spell. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments, which I think is better so that I could deal with more specific concerns if any rather than just generalizing my answers, and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

You use drytron's to search for everything while also using the cyber angel benten and Diviner of the herald to look for every card you need to summon out your lock down cards.  P.S the only problem with this deck is its inability to search spirit monsters easily. Your opponent has to have 3 spells or traps down and 3 monsters on the field to fully yatalock.

Assumes you have completed the pendulum tutorial in solo mode.,"<p>Solfachord is a fun pendulum deck quite difficult to master and expensive to make, but rewarding in its own right. While I consider this the most consistent version, please consider using the suggested alternatives in the side deck if you already have them.</p><p>Inherent Weakness of Pendulum Summoning : Pendulums require 2 cards from hand to activate the scales. Without additional searches, you are left with 3 cards in hand after activating scales on your first turn. Pendulum monsters do not go to the GY, so you can't rely on GY effects. Finally, the deck must mostly consist of pendulum cards for consistency and power (lacks handtraps or traps). Typically, these weaknesses are resolved using pendulum effects. However, <strong>Solfachords don't have pendulum effects that resolve these issues</strong>.</p><p><a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> : <strong>The best card for Pendulums</strong> <br />Summon Electrumite to use its effect to add <a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a> to the extra deck. Destroy a pendulum card in scale using Electrumite's effect and add Astrograph from the extra deck. Electrumite's effect draws you 1 card and Astrograph uses its effect to summon itself and add a copy of the destroyed pendulum card from the deck. With a single Electrumite you gained a free monster on field with +2 in hand. Electrumite requires two pendulum monsters to summon and you should ideally do the combo <strong>before</strong> your pend summon. So, how do we get Electrumite on field?</p><ol><li><a class=""type-pendulum-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=44179224"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/44179224.jpg"" data-card=""44179224"" data-name=""Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser"">Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser</span></a>&nbsp; : It's a free special summon from the pendulum zone if you control no monsters.</li><li>Normal Summon Starter : <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> is your main normal summon. You can send <a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia</a> to the GY and use its effect to tribute Diviner. Diviner then special summons Cutia from the deck when tributed.</li></ol><p>Now that we have Electrumite on field, let's take a look at our Solfachord cards. <br />Even Scale Solfachords : <br />8: <a data-name=""DoSolfachord Cutia"">DoSolfachord Cutia</a> is the <strong>main starter</strong> of the deck. It can search any of your Solfachord monsters except itself when summoned. By searching Dreamia, you can make Electrumite. <br />4: <a data-name=""SolSolfachord Gracia"">SolSolfachord Gracia</a> can search any of your Solfachord spells and traps. Prioritize Harmonia or Elegance. <br />Odd Scale Solfachords : <br />7: <a data-name=""ReSolfachord Dreamia"">ReSolfachord Dreamia</a> is an extender that can special summon itself if your have a Solfachord in your pendulum zone. <br />5: <a data-name=""FaSolfachord Fancia"">FaSolfachord Fancia</a> is your alternate Solfachord normal summon. It allows you to add any Solfachord monster to your extra deck. <br />3: <a data-name=""LaSolfachord Angelia"">LaSolfachord Angelia</a> can special summon a Solfachord monster from your deck that has scales +2/-2 of a monster you tribute. For example, Angelia can tribute itself to special summon Fancia or Coolia from your deck. <br />1: <a data-name=""DoSolfachord Coolia"">DoSolfachord Coolia</a> is your main deck boss monster. In your main phase, you can target up to 2 cards and negate their effects until the end of the opponent's turn. <br />Other Solfachord cards : <br /><a data-name=""Solfachord Harmonia"">Solfachord Harmonia</a> : This is an important field spell that can recover a Solfachord from your extra deck. It can also make any of your Solfachords into a 9 (high) scale. <br /><a data-name=""Solfachord Elegance"">Solfachord Elegance</a> : This is the <strong>most powerful card in Solfachord</strong>. It allows you to add any Solfachord from your hand to the extra deck to set your scales. This effect cannot be negated by Ash Blossom. <br /><a data-name=""Solfachord Musica"">Solfachord Musica</a> : It allows you to target and destroy a card your opponent controls.</p><p>All of the Solfachord Pendulum monsters have pendulum effects that prevent the opponent from negating or reacting to your pendulum summon. This makes the pend summon itself quite resilent. However, what's the payoff? <br /><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> : When <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> is sent to the GY, you can special summon Vortex Dragon from the extra deck. You can make the 7 rank Xyz using cards like Astrograph Sorcerer and <a data-name=""TiSolfachord Beautia"">TiSolfachord Beautia</a>. <br /><a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a> : For pendulums, <strong>having access to a link monster with arrows pointing to your main monster zones is important</strong>. You can easily make Selene using the Electrumite and Astrograph Sorcerer you have on field. <br /><a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> : This is the best link 4 that provides plenty of arrows for a pendulum summon. If you have other alternatives, feel free to use those. <br /><a data-name=""The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister"">The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</a> : Your main deck Solfachords have fire, earth, water, wind attributes while <a data-name=""GranSolfachord Musecia"">GranSolfachord Musecia</a> is a light. You can often make a 5000 ATK unaffected boss monster.</p><p>*<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> : While not a boss monster, it is vital to stop Maxx ""C"". Also, it is a level 3 tuner which allows for Halq plays or can help with synchro summoning. Other cards to consider : <strong>All of the suggested link monsters&nbsp;are great alternative options as they all have arrows pointing down. Consider using them instead if you already have them.</strong> <br /><a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a> : You already have an <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> in case you want to use Diviner's effect. <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> to add Ecclesia which adds Fleurdelis when special summoned. While this can make your endboard a bit stronger, note that this will prevent you from summoning from the extra deck for the rest of the turn.<a data-name=""Maxx"">&nbsp;</a></p><p><a data-name=""Maxx"">I hope this guide can help new players get into pendulum summoning using my favorite pendulum archetype, Solfachords. There aren't a lot of set plays once you have Electrumite on field, so you have to practice to set up strong fields. The deck hard bricks once every 10 duels, so keep that in mind when adding different engines like Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer to the deck.

Other cards such as Stardust Dragon, and Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend are featured as well. Harmonizing Magician is the center piece of the Main Deck due to her ability to Special Summon from the Deck when Pendulum Summoned. Pendulum Call and Duelist Aliance can be used to setup the Pendulum Scale, and to get Harmonizing Magician into the hand.  When Pendulum Summoning isn't required to Link Summon; Beyond the Pendulum is a powerful card to Link into for her effect to add a Pendulum Monster to your hand. Following up with a Pendulum Summon, especially if Harmonizing Magician is available, can allow you to Link into Zefra Metaltron, and even Synch into Borreload Savage Dragon to get two negates by equipping Beyond the Pendulum to it."

This deck is meant to take full advantage of myutants banishing mechanic, by permently whittling down your opponets cars through ""<strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>"", ""<strong>Myutant Mist</strong>"", ""<strong>Myutant Arsenal</strong>"" and<strong> ""Necroface</strong>"". While controling your opponents moves with cards like ""<strong>Summon Limit</strong>"" and ""<strong>Myutant Clash</strong>"". Then ""<strong>Soul Absorbtion</strong>"" is a nice little tech that will allow you to gain life with each banished card which pretty much ammounts to every card you use, allowing you to have sustainabilty if they were to ever get through your board.</p><p>A good start is if you open with ""<strong>Myutant M-05/Mytant ST-46</strong>"" and ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"". if you open with ""<strong>Myutant M-05</strong>"" you summon it search for ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>"" then use ""<strong>Myutant M-05</strong>"" Secound effect to banish ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"" immediatly milling 5 cards from both of your decks and Summoning Myutant Beast from deck. If you open with ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>"" Then you want to summon it instead search for ""<strong>Myutant EVO Lab</strong>"", then use ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>"" Secound effect to banish ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"" summoning ""<strong>Myutnat&nbsp; Beast</strong>"". if you are lucky on the Mill and banish ""Myutant M-05"" you can then use ""<strong>Myutant EVO Lab</strong>"" to special summon it from the Banish zone. which you would use to then search ""<strong>Myutant ST-46</strong>""&nbsp; and then use it secound effect to banish a trap to summon ""<strong>Myutant Arsenal</strong>"" from deck if able to.</p><p>A note to add is that the ""<strong>Necroface</strong>""&nbsp; proc will allow you to see what cards your opponent has in their deck giving you an hint to what they are playing and allowing you to make a more effective strategy.</p><p><br />Knowing that their are better options to play here is a guide if you want to make the deck a bit better.</p><p>So just in case i will give you a bit of a better deck list. for monster cards ""<strong>Myutant Gb-88</strong>"" and ""<strong>Myutant Mist</strong>"" are effects are very specific and when used can easily turn the game arround but just as easily can become brick in your deck. For these cards you can just replace them with any hand trap ""<strong>Ash</strong>, <strong>Psyframe Gamma</strong>,<strong> Max C</strong> and <strong>Nibiru""</strong> would be the most effective. You could also add more <strong>Nemese</strong> cards for how they take advantage of myutants banishing mechanic and would allow you to add link plays to the deck.</p><p>For Spell ""<strong>Soul Absorbtion</strong>"" and ""<strong>Psychic path</strong>"" are not needed and can be taken out entierly, but their main purpose in the deck is to take advantage of the bainishing mechanic. due to myutants always banishing both you and you're cards, ""<strong>Soul Absorbtion</strong>"" will allow for easy life and can keep you in the game for a bit longer. ""<strong>Psychic path</strong>"" will allow you to add 2 of you're myutant starters back to hand from the banished zone which can be incredibly powerfull. but overall both of these cards can end up bricking you if drawn at the wrong time.</p><p>""<strong>Pot of Desires</strong>"" and ""<strong>Pot of Extravagence</strong>"" can easily be switched between each other with absolutly no issue. Both of these cards can be gimmicked with ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"", If you are in an advantagous position you can use ""<strong>Necroface</strong>"" to shuffle back every banished cards but at the cost of your normal summon. This works better with ""<strong>Pot of Desires</strong>"" as the only down side that comes from it is the bannished. ""<strong>Pot of Extravagence</strong>"" on the other hand will stop you from using ""<strong>Myutant Evo Labs</strong>"" secound effect of allowing you to place one myutant card on the bottom of your deck and draw 1 but that is easily a price worth sacerficing.</p><p>Traps you have ""<strong>Myutant clash</strong>"". This card will allow you to target negate one monster card on the field but it require you to have a myutant monster in the graveyard to do this. its secound effect being allowing you to draw one for when a level-8 myutant destroys a monster by battle. This effect can be good but overall it can be replaced with Imperm which has overall just has better effect. You can also switch this out for ""<strong>There Can Only Be One</strong>"" as Myutants are able to take advantage of this card to full effect.</p>"

One of the decks which were always in my backpack was this Exodia deck. This version that I decided to upload here was the last one I owned at the moment I stopped playing the game (the banlist of reference is the one of <a>September 2012</a>). I think it's one of the most fun and competitive versions of this deck (without going into the FTK/OTK ones - which are not fun imho) and it's also quite unique.  It is only the final evolutionary step of a deck which saw a ton of modifications over those years, therefore since these days I was rethinking about old memories, I saved this decklist to not forget it. I also made a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-edison/"">version to play in Edison</a>, therefore adapting it to an earlier banlist (<a>March 2010</a>), which also reflects one of the earliest versions (much more defensive, with a variation using <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a> and <a data-name=""Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"">Scrap-Iron Scarecrow</a>) of this deck. Last but not least, I also made a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/exodia-2022/"">2022 version of the deck</a> to play the modern game (probably not my cup of tea, but it was fun to think about it and I will test it asap).  <span><em>I sincerely hope to bring back some sweet memories to you as well, I'd love to see your old decks from that era and I invite you to like and comment on all my decks if you wish!</em></span>"

This is my old <strong>Antimeta from 2012</strong> (respects the <a>March 2012 banlist</a>) which was always in my backpack at the time. A similar version could be nowadays played in <em>Edison</em> <em>Format</em> (<a>March 2010 banlis</a>t) with few modifications. In fact, I continued updating my deck until I kept playing the game regularly, which means somewhere in Summer 2012 (i.e. a couple of banlists ahead of Edison). I'd like to create an Edison version of this deck in the future.  The <strong>core idea</strong> of the deck is to summon some good troublemakers as <em><a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a></em> and/or <em><a data-name=""Thunder King Rai-Oh"">Thunder King Rai-Oh</a></em> whose effects will start blocking the opponent's moves. You want to do everything you can to defend the one which stops your opponent as much as possible and you have plenty of choices to do so.  The <em><a data-name=""Doomcaliber Knight"">Doomcaliber Knight</a></em> is quite predictable, but a nice attacking monster which also creates some troubles. Also, the <em><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Grand Mole"">Neo-Spacian Grand Mole</a></em> is useful to push back the Synchros from where they come from. The <em><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></em> is for emergencies and the <em><a data-name=""Banisher of the Radiance"">Banisher of the Radiance</a></em> and the <em><a data-name=""King Tiger Wanghu"">King Tiger Wanghu</a></em> are good if the opponent uses the graveyard (which is quite common) or small monsters respectively.  Cards will go away very quickly from your hand and field since you will activate lots of traps and spells, that's why we have the <em><a data-name=""Morphing Jar"">Morphing Jar</a> </em>for a quick reload (might as well disrupt the opponent's plans) and the <em><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a></em> doen no interfere with our plans since we do not special summon a lot.  The <strong>extra deck</strong> is not relevant to our purposes except for what we could summon in the very rare occasion we use the <em>Veiler</em> as a tuner or when we activate the <em>Starlight Road</em>.  In the <strong>side deck</strong> we can keep cards based on the meta, but I wasn't using it very much at the time.  <span><em>It's such a throwback to write this in 2022 and I sincerely hope to bring back some sweet memories to you as well, I'd love to see your old decks from that era and I invite you to like and comment on all my decks if you wish!</em></span>"

Magical Musketeers are an interesting archetype where all of your spells and traps can be activated from the hand if you have a Musketeer on the field. And with access to an amazing Link-1 in the form of Magical Musketeer - MAX, you can throw down with the best of decks, searching exactly what cards you need from the deck to your hand."

I also took a little inspiration from a <a>very nice deck</a> I've found on the <a>official Edison Format website</a>. As a gentle reminder, you can use this <a>website to check the card pool</a> of the Edison format and this <a>website to check the Edison forbidden &amp; limited cards list</a>.  The deck could easily work well with 40 to 42 cards, but no more than that. <h4>Strategy:</h4> Basically, we want to stun the opponent blocking every dangerous move with lots of traps and monsters which avoid special summoning, banish cards, bounce monsters, etc etc. A concrete risk is to run out of cards, so the <a data-name=""Morphing Jar"">Morphing Jar</a> is usually a very pleasant hand reload  The <em>Extra Deck</em> is not used except for the Stardust Dragon, it's there just for a reference of good generic Synchros for this format.  The <em>Side Deck</em> probably has room for improvements, the most important card is King Tiger Wanghu that could turn out to be incredibly useful. <h4>Variations:</h4> <em>More: </em>- <a data-name=""Gorz the Emissary of Darkness"">Gorz the Emissary of Darkness</a> (just add one, can save from some last second disaster) - <a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> (we could run x1/2 more in the <em>Main Deck</em> or in the <em>Side Deck</em>, for the moment I feel like we have enough removals or maybe it's too much already) - <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> (super strong card, it's not limited in this format so I'm tempted to run more of those) - <a data-name=""Smashing Ground"">Smashing Ground</a> (super strong card, it's not limited in this format so I'm tempted to run more of those) - <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> (could be better to use directly 2 in the <em>Main Deck</em>, but depends on how frequently it's possible to encounter mass removals) - <a data-name=""Legendary Jujitsu Master"">Legendary Jujitsu Master</a> (is a very powerful card, maybe run it in <em>Main Deck</em> instead of the Beast King Barbaros or simply as an addition)  <em>Less:</em> - <a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> (I have lots of doubts about this card, it's very strong, but I don't know if increase it or move it to the <em>Side Deck</em>, maybe it's redundant) - <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> (Having x2 in <em>Main Deck</em> and x1 in <em>Side Deck</em> could be too much, might consider removing x1 copy from one of the two decks) - <a data-name=""Royal Oppression"">Royal Oppression</a> (Depends on the opponents, but could be useful to move x1 copy from <em>Main Deck</em> to <em>Side Deck</em>) <h4>Useful cards:</h4> - <a data-name=""Black Horn of Heaven"">Black Horn of Heaven </a>- <a data-name=""Banisher of the Light"">Banisher of the Light</a> - <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> - <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> - <a data-name=""D.D.

This, in a Monarch engine, allows you to continuously make plays and gain more options as to what you wish to play - with cards such as Monarchs Stormforth or Ehther the Heavenly Monarch making full use of tributing. This, in tangent with Slifer and Soul Crossing, incites major card advantage while getting rid of opponent's monsters. Slifer also acts as a disruption against some decks and incompotent foes who can't read, as no one ever seems to realise Slifer has a really powerful last effect - reducing any opponent's monster summoned in ATK position's attack by 2000 and destroying it if it becomes 0 ATK because of this. But no matter how I put it, its still a glorified control deck that tries to limit opponent's plays and summons. Still extremely fun tributing your opponent's monsters to summon Slifer and beat them up with it. </span>  For just a look at what to do when you stare at me ranting on, just look at the boldened text to learn of the main premise.  <span><strong>Squad Goals:</strong></span>  <span>Your main goal in the beginning is to get out or search for our starter, Edea the Heavenly Squire, who will then be summoned (preferably SS'd so you can tribute summon twice) and activate its effect to summon Eidos the Underworld Squire. Eidos allows for another tribute summon upon him entering the field this turn.</span>  <span> Before tributing these two into a Monarch from hand, you should first try and get Pantheism of the Monarchs in the banished zone by using its effect to search for either disruption or continuation. Alternatively, if Pantheism has already been used or is not accessible, The Prime Monarch is a preferable substitute as it can banish a useful card in your GY.</span>  <span>After a Monarchs spell/trap is in the banished zone that you want, you can use: The Monarchs Stormforth (if an opponent has a monster), Return of the Monarchs or Precious Cards from Beyond to gain advantage. Preferably, use as many as possible but be cautious in decking out with Precious Cards from Beyond.</span>  <span> <strong>Tributing into a Monarch now allows you to use their effect which can be chained with Edea in order to stop it from being negated.</strong> <span>Caius is an extremely powerful asset against most decks as targetting and banishing a Dark Monster on the field makes your opponent have to banish every single copy of it no matter where it is, effectively shutting down a lot of decks that are reliant on said monster - an example is Eldlich, go make them cry. You do not specifically have to target a Dark Monster, you can target any card, but it is advised to do so if they don't benefit from it. He (she?) can also instead banish TWO cards if you tributed a dark monster (Eidos) so it can have the option of shutting down more of the opponent's plays. Furthermore, the card even does 1000 LP burn when you target and successfully banish - adding that small bit of burn that can end up winning games. </span></span><span>Ehther can be a massive impact as it gets another beatstick out on the field (preferably a second Ehther) which is returned to the hand during the EP, this effect is even better due to it sending two monarch cards - either thinning the deck out of now useless cards or setting up for a Pantheism banish effect / Prime Monarch summon. Ehther is also interaction as, by banishing a Monarch spell/trap in GY, you can tribute summon it on your opponent's turn - combo this with The Monarchs Stormforth to be able to tribute an opponent's monster for free and possibly interrupt them. Erebus is a powerful threat under certain circumstances due to its effect of shuffling an opponent's card (from field, graveyard or randomly from hand) with the same ""send two"" as Ehther, but the card really shines in the graveyard in which it allows for recycling at the cost of a Monarch spell/trap in hand which can further create more plays. Erebus is also needed for Return of the Monarchs, in which you can either search for it or search with it depending on which you summoned.</span>  If there is no advantage in using more than one tribute, you can set up Domain before the tribute summon to reduce the level of the Monarch in hand to LVL 6, meaning it only requires one tribute to be summoned. You can also tribute summon a Monarch using just one tribute summoned monster if neccessary - but it is unrecommended to do so as you're wasting potential growth in your board.  Eidos' GY effect can also be activated to SS Edea from the graveyard. If you know you have an extra Edea you can summon and make plays with, then you can not bother with saving it and can just use it straight up for a tribute material for even more advantage - but otherwise it would be advised to save it for your next turn so Edea's summoning effect can be used.  Finally, you can just set your traps or quick-plays to have interaction. Soul Crossing is one example as you can tribute three of your opponent's monsters to get out Slifer, which both the tribute and Slifer itself can greatly hinder their turn. Also, highly suggested you play Domain somewhere in your turn so that the opponent has to slay the tribute summoned cards before being able to access the Extra Deck.  <span><strong><span>Caution:</span></strong></span>  Using Soul Crossing limits you to only one more activation that is not Slifer's effects or any Divine-Beasts so try and use it towards the end of your turn to just not care about this limitation.  Monarchs Stormforth and, I believe, Soul Crossing don't allow for the tributing of non-affected monsters as the spell itself would be affecting it. This means that you can still tribute a monster that is unaffected by everything but spells, yet some cards are thus difficult to get over without Slifer beatstick.  Anchamoufrite is a free draw when put in the pendulumn scale and can be SS'd from the extra for the harsh price of nothing.  Caius is not optional, so if you tribute summon it and the opponent has no cards to target then say your goodbyes to one of your own cards.  Don't deck out with Precious Cards from Beyond, its effect isn't optional BUT using Soul Crossing means that only one can activate - use that and the fact you can use the Monarch's effect (to only need to tribute one tribute summoned monster) or Domain to lower its LVL to 6 so as to not fulfill the ""two tributes"" part as you will.  Don't die of laughter when you kill yourself with Precious Cards from Beyond or when you direct attack with Slifer for 12000 LP, haha.  Most importantly, good luck and draw the out."

However the twist this time might be the most delirious attempt to make, to make any bizarre Eldlich variant into a niche experience. By incorporating the golden lord with the protectors of <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a>, you become God of the GY and not just your GY. All of this while building the boards you usually do with the both of them separately, and returning the favor of giving your opponent temporary floodgates.  &nbsp;  So where to begin? Well there is the usual Eldlich package, which contains cards such as <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> and <a data-name=""Eldlixir of Scarlett Sanguine"">Eldlixir of Scarlett Sanguine</a> to either recover the Golden Lord from the GY or add him to the hand from the Deck. Next comes his minions; however the only two ""playable"" pieces in his arsenal are <a data-name=""Conquistador of the Golden Land"">Conquistador of the Golden Land </a>and <a data-name=""Huaquero of the Golden Land"">Huaquero of the Golden Land</a>. Simply put it that while there it isn't too much for him to offer when played alone; the way I assumed (from the last two years of seeing him being played) he was always meant to be played was as a hybrid piece that at least tries to have synergy with Eldlich. That being said the Gravekeeper archetype (a counter to Eldlich) coincidentally works well with Eldlich, regardless of Necrovalley's GY negation somewhat being a problem for the deck.  &nbsp;  Now the answers on how in the world does <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> get the pass the one field spell that stops it from doing what it does pass. For starters there is one monster in the Gravekeeper parable know to treat itself as the same infamous while on the field while on the field; but the catch is that it doesn't give off the GY negation effect the original field spell does (known truly as <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Priestess"">Gravekeeper's Priestess</a>). As a result of having both <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Priestess"">Gravekeeper's Priestess</a> and <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> in my deck, I can do the usual combo setup I can attend to do, and then once done (if I can) go into <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> pass for my opponents turn. This is useful because with the returning prevalence of GY effects (and the fact that the Branded Dragons use monsters in the GY as extensions for fusion summons), this puts a halt on any advance if they rely on their GY for any plays whatsoever. Then if you want to get rid of the said Necrovalley that is on the field at the beginning of your turn (regardless if you have a priestess or not), just scoop it with your <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>.  &nbsp;  As for your Extra deck, it is important to note that not all of them are gonna be used to the fullest extent, and sometimes would be fodder for <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>. However in this case, just about all the cards in the Extra deck did not go untouched through out all my matches. This is because I tried to make sure to find the ones best suited for situations where I could make use of them to the best I can. The card <a data-name=""Traptrix Rafflesia"">Traptrix Rafflesia</a> is a new addition in any of my decks, as it can detach one material to copy one ""Trap-Hole"" trap card milled to the GY by it's effect. Next comes the centerpiece of the Gravekeeper archetype, <a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist"">Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist </a>(a card that can't be destroyed by card effects if Necrovalley is on the field; but can search a Gravekeeper or Necrovalley card at the end of your turn). Then comes the additions of both <a data-name=""Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustorous"">Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustorous</a> and <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a>; and if you played in the format long enough (or played Yu-Gi-Oh the past couple years), you would know what both of them would do and while I added in the deck for a different reasons that each other, both have significant impacts that worked out to getting into either <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of Master Magicians</a> or into <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> without hesitation.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The idea behind the deck, initially, was to take advantage of the various interactions between Urgent Schedule, Machina Citadel, and Scrap Recycler (with the Wyvern). Looking at Regulus, I immediately liked it in the deck. Often this deck put up a Super Dora + Apollousa going first, but I love the idea of adding an easy maindeck omni, especially since Citadel + Regulus is a low-end board I can get behind.  So, it's an Urgent Schedule deck. The idea behind this card is simple - if you're going second, this card is going to make you Scrap Wyvern to pop cards, it is going to give you material for Unicorn, Accesscode (and Phoenix) to break board, and when you pop the Scrap Recycler with the Wyvern, it'll revive big daddy Citadel to add a 10 to your board, or just put up a board wipe. However, if you're going first, this card can add a level 10 Machine to your hand if you pop it with Wyvern, so this will help extend your combos. Also, this card can be a mini ""scapegoat"" that can save your bacon in a situation where you set it. 3 of it and the Recycler are mandatory. I'm on Raptor as my Wyvern brick, because it will get the second Recycler trigger going, but is also a back-up starter, albeit a much worse one.  I'm a big fan of the Irradiator/Megaform/Redeployment trick, so I'm running it here. Redeployment is an insane card, and helping set up my GY while guaranteeing a Citadel is super sweet.  I'm on all 7 legal copies of Regulus. There are a few reasons for this - firstly, redundant copies are good food for Fortress, but also work just with themselves to get you extra negation, and can even be played in multiple ways, so I'm cool on running multiple Regulus. Also the field spell is nuts. Additionally, the Field spell can be popped by Wyvern, so it does double duty. But the main reason is that I think this deck barely has legs without Regulus, and I wanted to really maximize my chances of seeing Regulus. This card is sort of like a Gryphon Rider for the deck defensively, and is busted in multiples, so I really wanted to max out and run all 7.  This deck is hurt by the Auroradon hit, but because your bread-and-butter was Wyvern, not Halq, it isn't a big deal. It does mean the end of the easy 3 Omni + Citadel setups, but Apollo + Citadel + Regulus should be fine (and occasionally you might sneak in a Super Dora, if you're feeling frisky, over the Citadel). Also, remember that Urgent Schedule prevents you from attacking with non Machine monsters - Regulus and Citadel are still live, and ""Choo choo!"" hitting them with a train is still on the table, but Accesscode is just to shred their board - otherwise build Apollo."

So, naturally, there comes a time when you look at a pile of purple cards and ask yourself: ""how many of these can I cram into a deck and still be playable?"" and turns out the answer is: ""around five or six"".  Your best cards are Branded Fusion and Rainoheart since are one card starters. Thankfully, both are accessible by Emergency Teleport-like effects (Branded Opening and Fusion Deployment). This frees the space for your normal summon so I decided to play the second best fusion normal summon (don't worry, He will make a cameo on this list anyway) without a tutor from deck spell card: Dinomorphia Therizia which searches the frankly absurd Dinomorphia Frenzy to go into Rexterm for a big floodgate. The funny thing is... There's still space for another floodgate in the form of Shaddoll Winda. SInce Branded Fusion is one of the most busted cards in recent memory, you can easily make her by sending Squamata or Beast when fusing Lubellion. If two floodgates aren't enough for you, oh boy, I have great news! By just adding one brick in the form of the dark Hex Sealed monster, you can also make Invoked Caliga if you dump it with Branded Fusion (which at this point is the atlas that carries half the format -which it says a lot considering it's also a format with full power Adventurer engine-). Honestly, at this point I was losing my mind by seriously considering playing Fusion Destiny since it's not only searchable by Alba-Lenatus, but you can also play Destiny Hero Malicious instead of Dasher to have an extra body on the field which can also be recycled by your Tearalaments and play it as if it wasn't semi-limited. Sadly I didn't do it in the end since the way this version of the deck works, you get locked into fusions most of the time so you couldn't really take advantage of this interaction. That being said, I hope someone finds a way to take full advantage of it.  DISCLAIMER: You should really be looking for a Tearalaments/Branded list, since it's the real best version of the deck."

Not gonna lie, this deck is actually much better than I thought it would be. If you want to put 2 Mechaba and a","I like Mechaba so much, I decided ""Why not put up a Mechaba with a Mechaba?"" The idea is pretty simple - Between Aleister and the Hex-Seals there are a lot of copies of ""Aleister"" to fuse with. Power Bond can serve as a back-up for Invocation to make Mechaba, usually making Mechaba #1. Herz is the ideal companion here - Herz can add a Cyber Dragon to your hand from your deck when it goes to the GY to set up Fusion plays, but it gets better from there. Pitch it with Mechaba, and you can use its effect to pick itself back up, meaning one copy fuels a single Mechaba for multiple turns. Additionally, if Therion ""King"" Regulus is equipped with Herz, when Regulus sends itself to the GY you can search (or pick back up) a Cyber Dragon. So this deck always has fuel for Mechaba. That's literally the deck, set up 3 Negates, then later kill with Chimeratechs, or use Chimeratechs to break boards and then set up negates if you can't OTK. You probably can. I believe in you! Or just attack with Cyber Dragon!"

They're just so dang fun, we need more support!</li>  	<li> <strong>Despia</strong>: Like I said, no clue how to build with Albaz lol I was considering using Dogmatika for this but since it's mostly a fusion heavy deck I didn't want to be locked out of the extra deck. The other part of the strategy is to utilize Tragedy and Opening for the main combo (Opening -&gt; send Tragedy -&gt; SS Aluber -&gt; chain both effects -&gt; profit) I also wasn't quite sure what the extra deck should look like so I just set up the extra deck with 2 of most of the fusions and do all the fusion shenanigans. Incredible Ecclesia is solid enough as a 1 of, especially since it's ~$80 GEEZ!</li>  	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: The deck is very weak to negations and handtraps, the Myutants can play around Ash pretty well but things like Effect Veiler, Droll, and others can hit this deck hard. It also has a hard time with backrow removal so it makes it a little hard in that regard too. My side deck is for those occasions when the hand traps are too much of a problem and for some different tech options. Like Tragedy discarded for Twin Twisters and Traptrick to get a Myutant Cry faster.</li>  	<li><strong>Notes</strong>: If you banish Tragedy for the cost of the Myutants it won't work :/ Had to learn that the hard way when I got judge ruled 3 times lol. I did consider running E. Teleport but Im just not sure what to take out ya know? Lastly Thank you again for reading and i look forward to reading any advise! :)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"

Easy Access to the cards you need in order to give your opponent a hard time if they are playing a deck that relies heavily on the extra deck. The main deck is set up for going first with a side deck built solely for going second. Cards that can easily be swapped out in general is the ""Floowandereeze &amp; the scary sea"" and ""Artifact Dagda"" as they are just place holders. for siding going second I typically side out the ""Harpie's Feather Storm"" set for ""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"" if I know that I have targets for their key Extra Deck Cards, and you can always side out ""Dimension Shifter"" going into game 2 or 3 depending on the Die roll if you're worried about opening it. Going forward I will be replacing ""Artifact Dagda"" once I figure out what would be a better target for ""Ghost reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"". Lastly I would like to maybe include ""Floowandereeze &amp; Snowl"" as a possibility for a side card as it has descent effects and is an additional target for ""Floowandereze Eglen"" although right now it's not the best choice."

It's a hybrid Tenyi build that focuses on some elements of control but also works to swarm the field with monsters while maintaining a decent hand advantage. To begin, our Tenyi core consists of three <a data-name=""Ashuna"">Ashuna</a>, three <a data-name=""Vishuda"">Vishuda</a>, two <a data-name=""Nahata"">Nahata</a>, two <a data-name=""Mapura"">Mapura</a>, two <a data-name=""Shthana"">Shthana</a>, and two <a data-name=""Adhara"">Adhara</a>. For those of you who don't know, the Main-Deck Tenyi monsters all have the effect to special summon from hand while you control no monsters, or all the monsters on your side of the field are Non-Effect. They work to swarm onto the field so you can link climb into their boss monster, <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>. If you control at least one Non-Effect monster the Tenyi's will also have a secondary effect. By banishing themselves from hand or grave: Ashuna can summon another Tenyi from the deck, Vishuda can target a card your opponent controls and return it to the hand, Nahata can reduce an opponent's monsters attack by 1500, Mapura can negate a card that target's one of your Non-Effect monsters, Shthana can reborn one of your Non-Effect monsters that was destroyed by battle or card effect then if successful, destroy one monster your opponent controls, and Adhara can recycle one of your banished Tenyi monsters back to your hand. This core allows us to maintain a powerful board presence with a few negates and have some play on the crack back if our board does get broken. For the rest of the Monsters, we play two <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> and a <a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a> to stop our opponent from gaining a strong a field presence. Two <a data-name=""Mimicking Man-Eater Bug"">Mimicking Man-Eater Bug</a> that when face down, still allows you to summon Tenyi monsters, and when flipped face-up will have the effect to target a monster your opponent controls, destroy it, and then gain that monster's original attack and type. Man-Eater also has the bonus of not being able to be destroyed by monsters with the type you just acquired. In addition, we also run two <a data-name=""Battle Faders"">Battle Faders</a> to prevent the opponent from attacking directly. Finally, to round out the monsters, we have two <a data-name=""Droll"">Droll</a> and one <a data-name=""Veiler"">Veiler</a> as the hand traps. For the spells, we have: one <a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart</a> to take control of an opponents monster, two <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> to clear the board, two <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> to add a Wyrm to hand and fill the grave with a Tenyi, a <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> for the field spell, a <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> to fill your grave with a Tenyi, not in hand, a <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> to recycle a monster and gain an advantage, and finally one <a data-name=""Flawless Protection of the Tenyi"">Flawless Protection of the Tenyi</a> to protect our Non-Effect monsters and once per turn draw two if your opponents has special summoned an effect monster. For the Traps, we are running: two <a data-name=""Swordsoul Blackout"">Swordsoul Blackout</a> to destroy two cards on our opponent's field, three <a data-name=""Threatening Roar"">Threatening Roar</a> to skip our opponent's battle phase, and two <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a>. This card is an Omni-negate that can trigger as long as you control a Non-Effect monster and if destroyed by your opponent card effect allows you to summon a Non-Effect monster from the Extra Deck negating its summoning conditions. In the Extra Deck, we have three <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a> and one <a data-name=""Lanphorhynchus"">Lanphorhynchus</a>, easy link climbing fodder for your main deck Tenyi's. One <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> to trade monsters. Two <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> to bring back a Wyrm from the grave. One <a data-name=""Ra'Ten"">Ra'Ten</a> and one <a data-name=""Sahasrara"">Sahasrara</a> to help flood the field. Two Berserker of the Tenyi to act as a Non-Effect beat stick. One <a data-name=""Yazi"">Yazi</a> and One <a data-name=""Catastor"">Catastor</a> for the synchros, one <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> for spell and trap removal, and one <a data-name=""Master of Oz"">Master of Oz</a> which is a High attack normal monster that can be bolstered by the Tenyi's effects. The side is pretty self-explanatory, <a data-name=""Ash Blosssom"">Ash Blosssom</a>, <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre"">Ghost Ogre</a>, and Veiler are all great hand traps. <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> can be used with Tornado Dragon to lock your opponent out of the extra deck, <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> can be summoned with one Tenyi and locks special summoning, two <a data-name=""Dragon Cycle"">Dragon Cycle</a> for searching and summoning, and an extra Flawless Perfection if you really need to draw it, There's no perfect end board for this deck it's built to adapt and change with games and prevent your opponent from gaining an advantage. For the most part, you want to focus on link climbing and special summoning with your main deck Tenyi's, setting up a board that has a few Non-Effect monsters like Monk or Berserker on board and a few Tenyi's in the grave. You'll also want to rely on the disruption this deck provides by using the traps, Man-Eater Bugs, and Droll's to stop your opponent from comboing off. Some of the funny techs this deck is able to provide is to use Blackout on your Non-Effect monster, pop two cards your opponent control, use Shthana to bring back your Non-Effect, and pop a monster on your opponent's side, essentially taking three off your opponent's field. You can set Mimicking Man-Eater Bug on your field, Summon Lava Golem to your opponents, pass turn your opponent takes 1000, then if attacked Man-Eater Bug can flip face-up, gain the attack of the Lava Golem and destroy it clearing your opponents 3000 monster. Utilizing the side deck you can set Scythe, special summoning one level four Tenyi and normal summon another level four, overlay for Tornado Dragon, then on your opponent's turn use the effect to detach one, pop the Scythe, and lock your opponent out of their extra deck for the turn. If your opponent is playing a deck with heavy back-row removal you can set Fists, bait out a destruction effect, then when destroyed special summon Master of Oz which, as a Normal beat-stick, is still protected by Tenyi effects.

And I got addicted to <strong>building several decks of this format</strong> because it's an event still <strong>little explored and full of good archetype ideas</strong> to use. The deck I present below is the <strong>improved version</strong> of the first Master Duel Normal/Rare deck I built: https://ygoprodeck.com/battlewasp-ballpark-nr-event-mar22/  Lately I stopped playing Master Duel because I have an error problem that prevents me from playing any game because a window appears that closes the game. I've already talked to the game's support and they gave me a lot of attention but the fact is that even with a print screen and details of how the error happens, I haven't been able to play for almost a month. So I decided to make some deck profiles of decks I had built in Normal/Rare Format and share my latest content related to Master Duel.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /// As I had already explained in the other deck profile the idea behind the deck and the synergies between the main cards used, here I will focus on the interactions I noticed when using the deck in tournaments that allowed me to improve it a lot.  <strong>Shinobi and Gokipole Interaction</strong>: You make the <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino"">Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino</a> using the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> as a material and <strong>pointing at an opponent's monster</strong> and the Gokipole uses its Special Summon effect from Vanilla <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> in the zone the Shinobi points to and <strong>destroys the opponent's monster that Shinobi points to</strong> which triggers the Shinobi's eff to give Reborn from <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> for example and you do Synchro-6 <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> to end the game. In other situations you can Reborn a Level 3 Insect to make <strong>XYZ Summon rolls</strong>. I've won several games just because of this interaction. Just remember that when making Shinobi using Gokipole and <strong>Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker</strong> you don't first bring Gokipole with Shinobi after the opponent's monster is destroyed, but Twinbow because he will be <strong>banished when he leaves the field</strong> and will not use its search effect.  This <strong>same interaction is valid for Puzzlomino and Gokipole</strong>: You make <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter"">Puzzlomino, the Drop-n-Deleter</a></span> using <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> as material and bring Vanilla <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> </span>in the zone he points and <strong>destroy an opponent's monster</strong> and you will still be <strong>able to manipulate its level to destroy another opponent's monster or make XYZ Summon or Synchro Summon plays</strong>. So <a data-name=""Puzzlomino"">Puzzlomino</a> is another interaction and versatility card available in the Extra Deck when you are not locked in Insects.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /// <strong>Technoplay and Missplays I made with the deck:</strong>  You should think a lot about the best time to use Reborn spell <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a> eff in GY to <strong>protect one of your Insect monsters from destruction</strong>. For example I already lost a game because I decided not to protect Synchro-6 <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> with it since I had <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> set to use on the opponent's turn.  Another mistake I made a few times was when using the <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> <strong>effect to send to the GY</strong> because the decision to special summon <strong>1, 2 or 3 copies</strong> of <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> is important for example if you <strong>drop 1 Vanilla in the Main Deck on your next turn you will be able to use this special summon effect again</strong>, which in this case would be the 3 Vanillas. So <strong>don't bring the 3 Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder Vanillas straight onto the field the first time you activate the Giant Ballpark effect</strong>. There's also the interaction between Special Summoning 2 Lv4 Vanilla and you do RANK-4 <a data-name=""Insect Number 70: Malevolent Sin"">Insect Number 70: Malevolent Sin</a> and then RANK-5 <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a> on top to have interaction of returning a defense position monster to the deck . Another missplay that you shouldn't commit when using <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> is that its <strong>floating effect of giving Vanilla Reborn is only when an Insect is destroyed by an opponent's card effect</strong>. So first that if you destroy your monsters with <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, Ballpark won't trigger eff from Reborn to Vanilla, and second that it won't trigger eff if the monsters are <strong>destroyed in battle</strong> so think carefully about using this card so you don't missplay in battle phase for example thinking she would give Vanilla Reborn.  MISSPLAY: You have a lot of <strong>cards that need to discard as cost to work</strong> so don't keep <strong>setting cards on the field for no reason</strong> as when you need a discard in your hand to resolve a <a data-name=""Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a> or <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a> this mistake will cost you the game. MISSPLAY: You don't summon Synchro 6 <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge"">Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge</a> in the Extra Monster Zone Column to <strong>make the Shinobi Co-Linked so the opponent can target him for attacks</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ///  In a format like this N/R with <strong>slower games</strong> and <strong>Spell/Traps based interactions</strong> you should save your Backrow removal as a <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> to use on the right cards.

But the archetype's main card is the <strong>excellent Field Spell</strong> <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> that you want access to as soon as possible. In the <strong>N/R format version</strong> many <strong>consistency cards</strong> don't exist so we have to adapt the deck with the best in the format like <a data-name=""Link Apple"">Link Apple</a> which is basically an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> ""free to play"" and <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a> which is 3 more copies from Pacifis, the Phantasm City. (One detail about how <strong>Phantasm Spiral cards work</strong> is that monsters from the Extra Deck with No effect are <strong>not considered Normal monsters</strong> like <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a> or <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Pearl"">Gem-Knight Pearl</a> which is used in the Extra Deck just for decoration because it's correct you <strong>never do them as this disables their interaction traps</strong> like <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Battle"">Phantasm Spiral Battle</a> and <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Power"">Phantasm Spiral Power</a>)  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Comments on cards and deck gameplay:</strong>  One of the biggest problems with this Archetype is that you <strong>have practically no interaction with the opponent until you control a Normal Monster</strong> since almost all spell/traps need this condition in order to activate their effects. And there's the fact that if your opponent is smart he can <strong>easily play around</strong> <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> by <strong>not activating any card effects</strong> but trying to win on the basis of Beatdown by putting monsters on the field and going straight to the Battle Phase. That's why I decided to give up using <a data-name=""Megalosmasher X"">Megalosmasher X</a> which has the synergy of being a <strong>WATER monster</strong> with the Trap <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> that can banish it to <strong>protect Pacifis,</strong> the Phantasm City from being destroyed to use the <strong>Mekk-Knight engine</strong>: <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Avram"">Mekk-Knight Avram</a>, these two cards play the role of <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> better since you can <strong>use it on your opponent's turn</strong> and the monster Special Summoned by World Legacy's Memory will be <strong>returned to the hand in the End Phase</strong> which means you can Normal Summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Avram"">Mekk-Knight Avram</a> on your next turn and <strong>trigger the effect of Pacifis, the Phantasm City</strong> to add another Archetype card and <strong>build pressure on the opponent</strong> faster than compared to Unexpected Dai and Megalosmasher X . The only thing about using <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> is that it conflicts with <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> effect of <strong>creating Token</strong> so it has to be used after creating the Token to Summon Mekk-Knight Avram. <strong>Other synergies of this engine</strong>: <a data-name=""World Legacy's Memory"">World Legacy's Memory</a> makes <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a> even better in the deck because before you <strong>had to choose between Normal Summoning</strong> <a data-name=""Megalosmasher X"">Megalosmasher X</a> or <a data-name=""Pathfinder"">Pathfinder</a> but now you have the option to bring Vanilla straight from the deck. And about Mekk-Knight Avram coming back into the hand in the End Phase you get a simple discard way to use <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>. So the improvements in using this engine are better than any other option available in Normal/Rare format.  Basically <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Battle"">Phantasm Spiral Battle</a> allows you to catch the opponent off guard when for example you <strong>used the effect of one of the Equip and it is now equipped on the Boss Monster</strong> of the deck and now it's the opponent's turn and he declares an attack on your monster that doesn't have the equip spell, you can activate Trap <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Battle"">Phantasm Spiral Battle</a> in the attack declaration and <strong>return the Equip Spell to your monster that is participating in the battle</strong> and take advantage of that battle phase in the opponent's turn.  The <strong>best Equip spell</strong> is <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral WAVE"">Phantasm Spiral WAVE</a> because your monster <strong>doesn't need to have battled an opponent's monster to resolve and bring the boss monster</strong>, as well as forcing the opponent to <strong>discard a card</strong> from their hand.  <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> is the best way to <strong>get rid of the token on the field so you can use the field's effect again to generate advantage and interaction every turn</strong>. Mainly do this on <strong>your turn to enter the Opponent's Turn without Token</strong> if Already have another Normal Monster on the Field. Another Missplay with <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> is not banishing NORMAL Monsters knowing that you will need to use <a data-name=""TORRENTIAL TRIBUTE"">TORRENTIAL TRIBUTE</a>. (Know that using Sea Stealth Attack eff on <a data-name=""Megalosmasher X"">Megalosmasher X</a> per example will <strong>count as a monster that returns to the field in the End Phase and not a Special Summon</strong> so you will never get trigger eff from FIELD <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</span> with this effect)  The Field spell <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> </span>basically works like this: The <a data-name=""Phantasm Spiral Token"">Phantasm Spiral Token</a> <strong>create effect is not once per turn</strong> and the <strong>add effect from deck to hand is MANDATORY</strong>.  The Tenyi Counter Trap <a data-name=""Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi"">Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</a> <strong>only negates spell/trap activation and not their effect on the GY</strong> like Eldlich's traps like <a data-name=""Conquistador of the Golden Land"">Conquistador of the Golden Land</a> and True Draco cards like <a data-name=""True Draco Heritage"">True Draco Heritage</a>.  Don't forget how important <a data-name=""Paleozoic"">Paleozoic</a> Traps are in the deck <strong>coming back from the GY as a Normal Monster having a lot of synergy with deck cards</strong> that get dead while a normal monster is not on the field.  <strong>Interaction between Sea Stealth and Paleozoic Traps</strong>: you can activate <a data-name=""Sea &lt;a data-name=&quot;Stealth Sea Attack&quot;&gt;Stealth Attack&lt;/a&gt;"">Sea </a><a data-name=""Stealth Sea Attack"">Stealth Attack</a> and in chain <strong>activate the Paleozoic Traps in GY to gain access to a Normal Monster</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////<strong>Deck issues:</strong>  <strong>Lack of pressure and consistency</strong> due to <strong>reliance on Field Spell</strong> <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> alongside cards like <a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a> to <strong>capitalize on advantage</strong>. So in addition to having a <strong>certain dependence on the opponent's actions</strong>, what you do is <strong>never enough to control the game</strong>, you are always losing until the moment when the opponent's pushes miraculously end and you win.

Here this monster is the <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> which is so old that I remember using this card over 12 years ago. Other decks that work with this theme are: Dinosaur structure deck that plays around the <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> card and the <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon"">Thunder Dragon</a> deck that was made to support the iconic early game card. The Nephthys deck works on the <strong>basis of Ritual Summon mechanics and has good Ritual monsters</strong> which already makes it a decent deck since when it comes to Ritual Summon if the deck cannot <strong>generate an advantage while Ritual Summoning it practically becomes unplayable</strong> but this is not the case with Nephthys. This archetype preserves some characteristics found on the <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> card mainly the fact that they <strong>work by destroying your cards to use their effects</strong> and also <strong>have effects when they are destroyed</strong>. The biggest problem with the Nephthys deck is that they copied the Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys part of <strong>activating their effects on the GY only on their next Standby Phase</strong> which makes them slow cards for Yugioh! Modern. However, we are talking about the use of this deck in NR format and here the Nephthys deck is not that slow, even having a competitive attachment.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Nephthys Gameplay Details</strong>:  <strong>The main idea of ​​the deck is to make the following combo:</strong> - Use <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> eff to add the missing combo piece to the hand either <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> which can be added with both cards or Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Rebirth of Nephthys"">Rebirth of Nephthys</a> which can be added by Manju. - Having the Ritual spell and monster you <strong>Ritual Summon</strong> <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a>. Then use Devotee eff and special <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> <strong>straight from the deck</strong>. (If you already control Disciple and used effect on turn you can bring it to <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> or <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> from Deck) - Disciple is the <strong>ROTA of both Monster and Spell/Trap</strong>. In this case the monster you add is the <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> (Follow Up) but it depends on the rest of your hand. - Use Disciple and Devotee to <strong>LINK-2</strong> <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver"">Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver</a> and eff to Add <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> (single target possible) from Deck and Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Rebirth of Nephthys"">Rebirth of Nephthys</a> from GY. - Using <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> eff destroys <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> in Hand to Special itself and the Sacred Phoenix <strong>already comes into circulation on returning from GY in the Standby Phase</strong> of your next turn <strong>destroying all the backrow on the field</strong>.  If you use <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> itself to Ritual Summon Devotee you <strong>get an additional pop</strong> from the Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Rebirth of Nephthys"">Rebirth of Nephthys</a> so always <strong>try to capitalize on that play</strong> by Ritual Summoning and surprising your opponent by <strong>destroying their cards</strong> without targeting.  One way to take advantage of <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> is with SPELL <a data-name=""Last Hope of Nephthys"">Last Hope of Nephthys</a> destroying it and an opponent's card. If you have <strong>2 Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys in the GY that were destroyed</strong> and you are in your Standby Phase, what happens will be that <strong>both of them return to the field with their mandatory effects</strong> and activate their mandatory effect to destroy the spells/traps on the field as well. In this NR format build, arriving at the <a data-name=""Devotee of Nephthys"">Devotee of Nephthys</a> <strong>Ritual Summon is the main move to be made</strong>, so even if you don't come with your hand aligned, always seek to access the missing pieces like Devotee and the Ritual Spell Rebirth of Nephthys as soon.  Cool that you <strong>destroying the Paleozoic Traps in your HAND</strong> to use the <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> effect per example <strong>doesn't generate you any downside</strong> because they come back from the GY <strong>allowing RANK-2 plays</strong>.  <a data-name=""Matriarch of Nephthys"">Matriarch of Nephthys</a> allows accessing <strong>RANK-2 moves very easily</strong> so it is common in the grind game to use <a data-name=""Disciple of Nephthys"">Disciple of Nephthys</a> to add Matriarch to be your Normal Summon. And you can use <strong>Disciple to destroy the Matriarch if you have it in hand</strong> and the Matriarch goes back to the field in the next Standby Phase and <strong>gives Disciple Reborn</strong> if it's in the GY.  The <strong>LINK-2</strong> <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver"">Nephthys, the Sacred Preserver</a> is like a <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> in the sense that it <strong>can give you a Plus 1 if you have a Ritual Spell in your GY</strong> which most of the time you do it you will. And his effect of <strong>destroying a ""Nephthys"" and bringing a different name</strong> instead is very useful to <strong>Loop</strong> the <a data-name=""Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a> during SP to clear Backrow.  <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> <strong>triggers eff from your Nephthys monsters</strong> so losing your board is no problem because your cards have <strong>floating effects</strong> in the Standby Phase.

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.

PUNK also ends on VFD off of 1 card. So, we're trying to cheese free games.  Still tuning this one (and TBH, learning VW lines). The deck is very good at making VFD, but struggles to back it with much out - either they can out it or they can't. Still, I decided to add a second Shenshen to the mix, so that you can use 1 with Dragon Mech for VFD and then put up Crocodragon and Shenshen alongside it.  This deck is pretty crazy - it makes VFD pretty easily, often through interruption, and Omega and Baroness (I respect milady's gender, unlike Konami!) also come up a lot more often than I thought they would. This list is pretty crazy in testing so far - VFD + Shenshen, + traps and sometimes another 8-10 synchro (Omega, Crocofish, or Baroness)  Still tuning the deck. Finding space for hand traps is tight in this format - you really want Gamma and Ghost Ogre, just for the E-Tele package, even though the format is a Maxx ""C"" format, and you just don't have the space for it IMO. Qinglong isn't great to see, but it will start VW plays with another VW, such a Lulu, so I wanted 3, but I also really wanted Foolish Burial Goods to be a Monster Reborn / ROTA for the deck (a little worse than that, since your gates do get used in combos, but it will enable plays). Ultimately, I cut it to 2 Qinglong to make space for the hand traps. PUNK engine is on 9 starters, down from 10 - this is a bit high, but it also means you can bait interruptions pretty well, and have great odds of starting with PUNK plays. 10 was a little too bricky, but I like the idea of using Ogre Dance for more consistency, even as a 1 of. I like 2 Chuche, I don't hate seeing the card, but it can be easily sent from the deck for its GY effect, it is better activated with the spell card than set in your combos, and it just doesn't do a lot in your combos. I'm considering Pot of Avarice - the deck already has a couple of ways to loop banished cards back into the deck, and this could rebuild your combos to pull it off again in a grind game, or even just make the Crocodragon a disruption instead of just an empty threat.  The hand trap line-up is pretty simple. I'm on 2 Ghost Ogre - running this makes E-Tele a disruptive card if it resolves, which is tight, and it helps that it is an emergency level 3 tuner. We've also got a suite out of respect to Maxx ""C"" - this is a combo deck that puts up a lot of bodies, so we need an insect answer. Called By is potentially a bannable card, and we're running both allowed copies. Ash is nice and generic, I think it is almost mandatory in a Maxx ""C"" format, but I'm on 2, because Gamma can also answer the insect while being higher quality as a disruption and defensive card. Gamma is the more important E-Tele target between it and Ghost Ogre - usually you'll be summoning a PUNK or VW card, but if not Gamma is enabling an Omega or Baroness. Lastly, there was space for a lone Maxx ""C"" - on the one hand, this is a super sacky 1 of, but on the other, with 2 ofs your other hand traps and no redundant copies, you won't have the problem of drawing Maxx ""C"" or other redundant interruptions as much as in a deck spamming 3 copies of its cards.  Cut Ghost Ogre - might be a good card in the shell once Brave hits the format, but in the meantime, there are too many other high quality targets for E-Tele to ever need to summon Ogre, and I needed space for the essentials. I'm still shy 1 Maxx ""C"" but there just isn't the space.  I'm testing a larger version of the deck - in theory, this should allow me to get better ratios on my hand traps, as well as giving me the space to run more tech cards. I'm at 55 cards, which means my PUNK package is about 1/5 of the deck (good odds for a 1/5 hand, no?). The VW part gets slightly sketchier, in theory, but in reality it seems absolutely fine. I decided that 55 cards with 3 Avarice would give me excellent ratios on my hand traps and VW starting combos, while also giving me a little bit of gas, and the ability to rebuild my extra deck in a grind game. I'm not sure Avarice will make the cut in the long run, it is kinda sketchy and a little bit ""win more"", but this deck could also genuinely use it after it has burnt up its combo to try again, and fills the GY very easily with either the PUNK or the VW engines. I cut Zeus, because it was barely coming up, and replace with with the PUNK Dragon, which will also probably barely come up, but hey, it's a really removal effect on the card, and the recovery is also nice, and besides, if I'm playing PUNK cards might as well make the new best 11 synch in the game.  Back to a nice, tight, 40 card list. The other list was consistent enough, but if the PUNK engine got stopped before Crocodragon it didn't consistently have Virtual World plays, which is sad, so instead we're running a much tighter list, with a single Ghost Ogre - you shouldn't usually need it off of E-Tele, but you often have it when you do."

Morphtronics,"Use Halq to summon Scopen from the deck (treated as level 4 in def) and tune it with a Celfon for Hyper Librarian. Now each time you summon a Formula Synchron using a Celfon and a Smartfon/Telefon you'll draw 2 cards. A Smartfon in def lets you stack your deck as well, so you'll get to draw the cards you actually want (useful when you only have tuners on the field to ensure you can add a spell with Princessprite). When your field is full, link everything (besides Librarian) away for Saryuja to get 4 more draws (the special summon from hand is helpful too). Repeat using Telefon targeting another copy of itself/Junk Box and Pot of Avarice (shuffle Extra Deck monsters or Celfons to potentially make another copy of Machine Dupe live again) till you get all pieces. Consistent enough to get a decent hand and can play through some handtraps with Junk Box, since the -fons are all sopt's and Telefon can get enough Link fodder on the field with a good grave. You can also switch the one-of draw spells and Where arf thou? with a Crossout package to be better off against handtraps."

It is capable of breaking boards quite easily in-engine going second, but is also able to put up incredible interruptions going first, and has decent grind game. I'd call it a combo deck, but a very midrangey combo deck, and I like to play towards that grind game. This list incorporates a small PUNK package, DPE, Halq+Auroradon shenanigans, and a pile of Wyrm and goodstuff synchro monsters.  So, for Punk monsters, I'm on a package of 7 cards. The idea behind this package is pretty simple - it enables Halq-Auroradon starts, or Verte follow-ups. The way it works is you NS Ze Amin, search Foxy Tune, discard Foxy Tune and pitch a card to special Madame Spider. Madame Spider searches the Trap, which is basically Imperm for most intents and purposes, then you go into Halq. The combo has 2 main routes - you either Summon Yazi and pop him to summon out a Swordsoul level 4, usually with the intention of making 2 8s or an 8 and a 10, or you make Baroness right away with Deskbot and the tokens, and then NS a Swordsoul monster to continue your combo from there. The real appeal to this package is Emergency Teleport - this allows you to make Halq (or occasionally Verte) without using your NS, and while it does require pitching a card, it replaces it with an interruption. 2 E-Tele is mandatory if you run this package - this is the best PUNK card. 2 Ze Amin are run just because of E-Tele - When you see E-Tele + Ze Amin you can summon another from your deck and pitch the one in your hand for free consistency and starts without a normal. Otherwise you'd run 2 Foxy Tune, which does still require your NS to do full combo, but also works as a sort of extender when you see your PUNK cards. The Spider and Dangerous Gabu are optional - you could run a third Ze Amin for more consistent starts, or you could replace the ""bricks"" in the main deck with 1 in the extra deck with the Fusion monster and run the Sharakusai instead of Spider, which will help you start more often. I don't have space in this version for Sharakusai in the extra deck, and I don't think Spider, a card that just plusses you by finding an interruption is that hard a brick - the trap with no real activation requirement beyond a monster being on your opponent's field is definitely not. This option mitigates the cost of discarding a card, and even helps you with consistency. Just don't be afraid to pitch the Spider instead of Normal Summoning it if that will make your end board bigger - the goal isn't to always search Gabu, Gabu is a nice bonus you'll find more often than not. However, if you don't like DPE you could consider Ogre Dance or Sharakusai in the package.  DPE bricks are here. You'll see Fusion Destiny often enough, and this whole package all together is insane, much more than the sum of its parts. DPE here can trigger Chengying, help recurr Ecclesia, the Draw 2 is actually very much appreciated. It also just does usual DPE things, being a good backup plan. I should note that you won't be adding DPE to your boards very often, and should consider the setups for it that you have available. For example, Chixiao could link with a Tenyi monster (not the link) into Verte, and while you'd just be ""exchanging"" an interruption, having the Draw 2 on the table is really sweet. Likewise, Omega is potentially great material for DPE. Interestingly, you can happily pitch a Destiny HERO monster to the PUNK engine in this deck, and just recover the HERO with Omega later, especially since you aren't reliant on DPE. Having said that, this is IMO the perfect DPE shell (at least, while Verte is legal - after that probably just Fusion decks I think).  I'm on Tenyis. 2 Adhara, 2 Vishuda. Used together, they can make Halq and go into the Auroradon lines. If you SS Vishuda and NS Adhara you can immediately make a Baxia to spin 2 cards. Also, both of the GY effects are super relevant. I'm keeping these packages small: Vishuda is great going second as a board breaking tool and Adhara enables combos and seriously helps with the grind, and they actually also enable Halq, DPE, and Baxia, so these are good. Nonetheless, I don't want too many Tenyi monsters clogging my hand.  1 Deskbot, because it SS itself from the GY for Auroradon lines. If you're looking for a bigger combo, a single O-Lion or Coltwing would enable a lot without changing the list very much - if you work at it, big Denglong combos are possible, but IMO they involve too many bricks and are just ""win more"". Either they stopped you before that, they have Droplets, or you're probably winning anyway. You could also run a single Jet Synchron with a link monster to go into, which would allow you to do Auroradon combos using either Jet or Deskbot to make Halq, and Jet will be a 1 card Halq (more interesting if you aren't already on 3/4 PUNK NS).  Swordsoul Emergence looks like just another ROTA, but oddly enough it is one of the deck's main 1 card starters, and by itself it can make an 8, or a Yazi going second. Also, strangely, the usual benefits of running Rotas to pull combos together aren't really here, or at least not to the same degree. Still, this card is very good, and I'm glad I found space for all 3. Sacred Summit is fine as a 1 of - sometimes it can revive a Swordsoul Synchro monster, sometimes even turn 1 after linking it off, but its main purpose is activating both Swordsoul level 4 effects in the same turn, and it is important to your main combo lines. Taia is fine as a 1 of - you search it out or summon it from the deck, but don't want to see it very much otherwise, and you can recycle 1 copy because Omega should be banned. I'm on 2 of the rest - Ecclesia basically stands in for either level 4 Swordsoul, and can SS itself going second, and recycles itself off of DPE doing DPE things, Mo-Ye is just better Taia a lot of the time, making easy 8s and drawing a card (in a way that chain blocks the 8). We're only on 2 Mo-Ye because you need 2 copies in rotation for follow-ups to be smooth, you kinda don't want to see it that much - however, it is fine to NS, and just play Swordsoul like Konami and God intended. We're on 2 Longyuan because I think you do want to see this card a fair bit, this is the easy 10 added to a lot of boards, sometimes it helps make Baroness before you start your combo which is impressive, the burn is medium but has actually mattered in a fair few matches, and while you want to search it out you would rather search out Sacred Summit or the Blackout if you could.  So, Ash, Maxx ""C"", and Called By the Grave are pretty standard, but we're not on a lot of hand traps after that. Why? Well, Swordsoul abilities are great at breaking boards, and cards like Fusion Destiny really help create pressure as well. Vishuda also ends up being Imperm or better in a lot of situations (often much better). The lone Ghost Ogre makes the cut because we're low on E-Tele targets, and also this way E-Tele represents an interruption at best, and an information hazard at worst (when often, drawn late into the combo, it would be dead otherwise). If Vishuda is one half of Imperm, Gabu is the other half - it is here because it is searchable, nobody is running this over Lost Wind, let alone Imperm, but the card is good. We're on 2 Blackout - I really like this card, but here it is also our only backrow hate. I like relying on traps to answer backrow anyways - gets around IO and Secret Village. I feel like Solemn Judgment is really good here - you're often trying to create scenarios where you can protect Chengying in multiple ways while having a way or two to trigger him. Solemn is just a good solid negation effect that handles a lot of the board breaking cards that can help against us (including most hands with Droplets against generic decks).  So, Extra deck, real quick -  1 Monk of the Tenyi. I'd love a second of these, don't burn your Monk up if you don't have to. Remember you can turn your Tenyi's on with Swordsoul tokens, and only make Monk when you have to. Still, space is too tight for 2, and you absolutely need 1.  1 Verte with 1 DPE. You won't make Verte a lot, you're usually hard drawing the Fusion Destiny, but you'll get stopped and make DPE on occasion, and you should run it while it is legal. It also opens up new routes to different high-end boards (if you use your thinker).  1 Needlefibre, 1 Auroradon. These 2, always causing trouble. This combo is stupid, and tuner + any other monster is 5 zones filled and another effect on top of it? I still say Halq needs to be banned - Auroradon might be a problem without it, but I'd be inclined to let it operate alone, because whenever this card is a problem it is with Halq.  Yazi is insane going second, and part of the main Halq line, so this one is mandatory. It is easier to make than you'd think.  2 Baxia. This card is good removal, another tool to trigger Chengying, and a wild combo enabler in some very strange lines. You can also use 1 Rota to make Yazi, use Yazi to pop a card and Yazi, Yazi effect to summon another Swordsoul and make Baxia, remove another card (s if you used Taia), and you still have Baxia's other effect. I would run 2 - this card very occasionally comes up going first and is a crucial tool on every later turn.  Omega and Savage are a package deal. Omega does literally everything but ever affect the field - that's not technically true, it occasionally beats over a monster. But the card A) attacks the hand, B) can provide information, C) recycles banished cards into the graveyard (including face-down ones?), D) recycles cards in the GY back into your deck and E) because of a quirk of THAT effect can also function as GY hate? Oh yeah, and there's no HOPT on there. Anywhere. Why is this card legal? Savage is also extremely good, and unless you have something specific to recover you should be making Savage when Halq is in the bin, especially since that's a play that protects a potential Chengying.  2 Chixiao are in the extra deck. This card immediately plusses you on summon, and then is a half-decent on-field negate after that. You need 2 because you're making this card right away and need a second for follow-up. If you ever need more, you can use Omega, although Omega can only recurr so much.  1 Baroness de Fleur. Omni-negates are good. Popping cards is good, although popping your own cards doesn't come up in this build as much as I expected. The tag-out is also wild in this deck - for example, it revives a DPE that has been Kaijued, as well as potentially Yazi and/or Baxia with are both insane targets too in their own right. It also lets you repeatedly set up the negate.  I'm on 2 Chengying, because I love this card. The rule for this card is simple - you need at least 1 way to trigger him, 1 way to protect him (not Chixiao, we're talking Solemn, Baroness, or Savage)... and then at least 1 extra. In other words, if Chixiao is the only way to trigger him, but I also have Savage and Solemn, I make Chengying - if it's Blackout and Chixiao but no negate, I make Baroness. This card is nuts, it's almost a floodgate against a lot of decks, it is a crazy powerful interruption if you use your brain, and the card also beats over everything and is a decent wall in Defense Mode too... oh yeah, and also it has generic protection too, for reasons that are good. the card does a lot. However, don't play into Nibiru, it really isn't worth it. Oddly, Baroness is sometimes just flat-out worse than Chengying, so even though I've stressed this play pattern, I also want to point out, when you have a secure Chengying, freaking make Chengying, because at that point you're narrowing down the lines of counterplay even further.  Still perpetually tuning - changed the P.U.N.K. package around to try and reduce some of the frequency of those bricky hands. While they were very soft bricks, I just don't think a deck that runs Deskbot as a true Takatomborg, as well as Destiny Hero monsters for Fusion Destiny, can afford the Gabu package, even though it was typically pretty good at mitigating the disadvantage from Foxy Tune.  Forever tuning. After a brief foray into the Rose Dragon package, I ultimately decided to stick to just PUNK, Tenyi, Swordsoul, Halq, and DPE (that's enough pile IMO). I just needed some of those generic staples back into the main, and so this version is tuned to do a little better going second. It bricks slightly more often, but also has play way more often, so I prefer this version."

When bad hand, next game use KaLi YuGa to win the gam","I use this deck and got the top5 on the 43 people weekly tournament last month.  The goal of this deck is to make the 3 Ultimate Falcon boards. (require 2 rank up magic in hand). 1 rank-up magic can make 1 to 2 Ultimate Falcon for final boards. 0 rank up can make 0 to 2 Ultimate Falcon for final boards.  The final board has 3 Ultimate falcons which all are unaffected by other card's effect, 1 to 2 booster Strix on hand to protect the Ultimate Falcon destroyed by battle, or 1 booster Strix and raidraptor-readiness to avoid all the damage in turn 2.  To make the ultimate falcon, there are 3 +1 ways. First is to make the rank 7, and use it and another raidraptor to link wise strix, when rank 7 send to the grave, it can special summon 1 ultimate falcon from the extra deck. The second is to use last strix or cattle to make the rank 8 satellite cannon falcon, then use astral rank up or skip force to make the ultimate falcon. Third is to use the phantom knights' rank-up-magic force to make the ultimate falcon.  1 way that is not common to use is when rank 5 destroyed and sent to grave, bringing back the ultimate falcon from the grave.  To make the rank 7 Arsenal Falcon(Key Card for this deck), there are 2 + 2 ways. First way is use any 2 level 4 raidraptor to make raider's knight, then use effect to make rank5 stranger falcon, then use astral rank up or skip force make rank 7. Second way is use cattle or last strix make rank 6, then use raid force or phantom knights' rank up magic launch to make rank 7. Another 2 uncommon wat to make rank 7, one is to use cattle or last strix to make rank5, the use astral or skip rank up to make rank7, one is to use phantom knight's rank up magic force to make rank7(this will block wise strix for the rest of the turn), those siuation usually happen when start with not good hand, or be blocked some step by handtrap.  To make rank 4 force strix, just remember the basic all level 4 raidraptor effect, how to extend basic on the hand, usually start with vanish vanishing Lanius or tribute Lanius or last strix. Then speical strangle lanius or fuzzy lanius or pain lanius to make rank 4 or link 2.  (Remainder* Strangle lanius has limit for the Dark monter for the rest of the turn, Fuzzy lanius has limit for the ""Raidraptor"" monster for the rest of the turn, Pain lanius use for xyz only can use for wing beast xyz monster, raider's wing used effect to speical summon will banish when it leaves the field.)  To win the game in turn 3, firstly keep at least 1 Ultimate Falcon with xyz material(it can detach 1 material to block opponent all card effect for the rest of the turn), then use Rank-Up-Magic Skip Force in the grave, banish it, and 1 raidraptor monster in the grave, reborn 1 raidraptor xyz monter from the grave.(usually keep 1 of your opponent monster attack at least 2500, then reborn rank 5 stranger falcon, suicide attack that monster, when stranger falcon destroyed by battle or effect and send to the grave, it can reborn 1 raidraptor monster from the grave, then bring back the rank 7 on the grave, and suicide attack that monster, then rank 7 destroyed and send to the grave, use rank 7 effect to bring the rank 12 final fortress falcon from the extra deck, use rank 12 to attack, when rank 12 attack destroys the opponent monster, it can banish the raidraptor xyz monter from the grave and attack again, this effect can use at most twice which means at most 3-time attack with 3800 attacks. )  Another way of this deck is to use 2 heel eagle change 2 fuzzy Lanius to avoid ""Raidraptor"" monster limit, then make Phantom knight Rusty search rank up magic launch, and use gagagaga magician reborn the rank 7 on the grave, then make KaLi YuGa in opponent's turn.  <strong>Common Handtrap Part</strong>  Ash: only force Strix or the mimicry Lanius or fuzzy Lanius will be affected by ash, for the effect, special summon from the deck by wise Strix, it can use a self chain to avoid ash, witch is chain 1 wise Strix, chain 2 fuzzy Lanius or Arsenal Falcon effect in the grave.  Infinite or Effect veiler: depends on which step when your opponent uses. Usually use some not the most important effect first, then see if they use any of these effects.  Nibiru:  The biggest challenge for this deck, has two ways to avoid, one is to make the Arsenal Falcon in 5 steps (require rank up magic in hand), and another one is to make the ultimate Falcon first(also require rank up magic in hand), then detach material to avoid all the card effect until the end of your turn.  Psy Gamma and Ghost Orge: Also depends on which step they use, but they always use for first effect or wise Strix effect, then check the hand if there are more monster special summons.  Ghose Belle: only works on the Arsenal Falcon, if this is not use the rank up from the wise Strix search, make the second one by wise Strix to get the second rank up magic.  ...And there are more and more handtrap for the game, if you can not over, just start a new game! My deck is not perfect, but the meaning of the monster is uneffected by any card effect is really good for the environment now, just avoid the kaiju and the monster can increase attack! Hope this is helpful to you."

I’m here with another master duel list, this one is for mekk-knights!  Normally Blue Sky would be at two but Girsu is a limited card in master duel and so I rolled with three to be better at searching.  This particular list aims to go second, it’s entire idea is to otk with big bodies because that’s what mekk-knights are but if it can’t do that it’s other job is to use Key, Whispers, and Secret to preform a lockdown.  People in master duel don’t play around mekk-knights.  Mekk-Knights have four animated monsters!  Purple Nightfall as the leader of the Mekk-Knights and the strongest one stats-wise while they are separated (nightfall also is probably the best one, period).  Blue Sky is a monster who serves importance in the storyline choosing a successor and other things, he’s also a pretty solid card too who can provide three searches.  Spectrum Supreme, the monster who basically is when all of the Mekk-Knights combine into one.  And Avramax, who is just a Mekk-Knight for lore reasons.  Overall, very fun! Would recommend if you want to see how bad players are at reading!"

It is still OTK focused with some things to do going first.  The cards: <ul>  	<li>Jizukiru: A searchable Kaiju that you can fuse away for Fortress Dragon.</li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon: The original. Easy monster on the field going second, the target for Machine Duplication, can out stuff like Apollousa/Mechabe via the Chimeratechs.</li>  	<li>Galaxy Soldier: A machine Lv5 for Nova and a LIGHT Lv5 for Pleiaden. With him and a Herz on hand you get a full Nova with a Cyber Dragon in GY to revive (Soldier send Herz to special &gt; CL1 Soldier add another Soldier, CL2 Herz add a CyDra &gt; Send CyDra to special the second Soldier &gt; Overlay into Nova/Pleiaden). Only at 2 because you can only search OPT with it so the 3rd one tends to be dead. Searchable with Cyber Repair Plant.</li>  	<li>Cyberdark Chimera: Part of the Cyberdark Engine. Searched via Cyberdark Realm, you can send a Spell from Hand to GY to search Power Bond and you can also fuse from GY for that summon. Very easy OTK, but pretty disruptable.</li>  	<li>Cyberdark Claw: You can discard it to search for either Cybernetic Horizon or Cyberdark Realm. It is also a material for Cybernetic Horizon to send to grave. Only 2 because you don't need a 3rd.</li>  	<li>Maxx ""C"": Master Duel Tax. I wish it were banned.</li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Core: Searches every Spell/Trap, starts your combos, is a CyDra in GY and on Field, can be searched by Emergency and Repair Plant, is a target for Machine Duplication and can be banished from GY to special a CyDra-Monster from Deck when you have no monsters. Very susceptible to Ash/Imperm.</li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Nächster: Great extender and good for recovery. You can send a CyDra to GY to immediatley revive it. You can also revive Nova/Infinity or Rampage Dragon. Very searchable and can be specialed by Core for recovery. Is a target for Machine duplication.</li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Herz: Searches a CyDra from Deck or GY(which includes Nächster/Core due to their effects) when it is sent to GY (either by Contactfusing it, as material for Soldier/Nächster/Droplet). Can also become a Lv5 when specialed. A Machine Duplication target.</li>  	<li>Cyberdark Realm: Searches Chimera (or Claw if need be) and gives you a free Normal Summon. Can be searched by either Claw or Core.</li>  	<li>Cyber Emergency: Searches every CyDra and can be recovered if the activation(!) is negated. Searchable with Core.</li>  	<li>Cyber Repair Plant: Searches a LIGHT Machine when you have at least 1 CyDra in GY. Is used for Soldier and Jizukiru and can be searched by Core.</li>  	<li>Cybernetic Horizon: An insane searcher. Gives you either part of the Cyberdarks/CyDras (whatever you need), can activate Herz and sends a Cyber-Fusion to GY, which is also important for the OTKs. Only at 2 because it can be dead quickly and is searchable with either Claw or Core.</li>  	<li>Machine Duplication. Gives you 2 CyDras on the Field when you have Core/Nächster/Herz. So you get a very easy Nova -&gt; Infinity with it. It's not OPT(!).</li>  	<li>Overload Fusion: Great Recovery, can be used to extend into Rampage after a combo.</li>  	<li>Power Bond: Enables insane OTKs. Can be searched and 'powered up' with Chimera.</li>  	<li>Called by the grave: To stop Ash/Maxx ""C""/DPE/etc.</li>  	<li>Cyberload Fusion: Can be searched with Core, works great together with Chimera/Overload. It's a quick-play, so you can use it in the Battle Phase for  e.g. Twin Dragon to push for game.</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplet: A must-have going second. Also triggers Herz.</li>  	<li>Cybernetic Overflow: Great disruption when you have to go first. Searchable with Core</li>  	<li>Infinite Impermanence: A great trap, works from your hand when your field is empty, but is not dead when you have to go first.</li>  	<li>Cyber Eternity Dragon: Your primary target for Cybernetic Horizon. It protects your OTK by banishing it from GY. Can also be used as a wall in a pinch.</li>  	<li>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon: Removes monsters from the Extra Monster Zone, great to remove Arrival-Cyberse/Apollousa</li>  	<li>Invoked Mechaba: You can summon it with Nova when your opponent Nibirus you.</li>  	<li>Chimeratech Overdragon: As a comeback option with Overload Fusion.</li>  	<li>Cyber Twin Dragon: Mostly summoned with Cyberload Fusion during the Battle Phase to push for game.</li>  	<li>Chimeratech Fortress Dragon: To remove hard to remove machines like Superdora.</li>  	<li>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon: Your primary OTK-enabler. Destroys enemy backrow and can attack up to 3 times by milling 2 monbsters from deck. Thats 12600 Damage with Power Bond.</li>  	<li>Cyber Dragon Infinity: An omni-negate for going first or to protect your OTK.

Spells and Trap heavy deck that all orient around chance that rely on delaying your opponent and chip away their LP towards victory.  The game starts as soon as the first coin flip happens to give you the moral and the better chance to win <strong>Gambler </strong>is in your starting hand to refresh your hand after your first move. <strong>Second Dice Roll</strong> is a must have to increase your chance to get the results you want and to avoid the negative repercussions of getting the wrong call, especially with <strong>Gambler. </strong>Its high risk, high reward at the beginning of the duel.  Consider your monster cards as your opponent's dealer. <strong>Ms. Judge </strong>and <strong>Dice Jar</strong> forces your opponent to test their own luck. If their luck is as shitty as yours, you can cripple your opponent's monster field to keep yourself alive. <strong>The Paths of Destiny </strong>and <strong>Head Judging </strong>also makes your opponent to test their luck and to deal good damage if luck is on your side.  <strong>Tour of Doom,</strong> <strong>Fairy Box, </strong>and <strong>Roulette Spider</strong> should be considered as your last line of defense.  Having <strong>That Six</strong> should only be used to rig the result of <strong>Dice Jar</strong>'s outcome and use the maximum potential of it's effect. By changing your dice result to a 6, you deal <em>6000LP </em>without relying on luck.  <em>There are a few things to consider while using this deck that the cards don't make clear; </em><strong>- Second Coin Toss </strong>only works once, and only once. It can't be used on multiple cards that has a coin flip effect. <strong>- </strong>Against decks that can kill spells and traps or cards like Harpies' Feather Duster or Lightning Storm is this deck's weakness since there's no defense against them. <strong>-</strong> Activating<strong> Second Coin Toss </strong>after activating <strong>The Paths of Destiny </strong>also give your opponent the chance for another coin toss. <strong>- </strong>Use <strong>Dicephoon </strong>before placing down any cards if by the off chance that your roll a 5 and must destroy one of your spell/trap card after destroying your opponent's.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9__fRBhRzXM</a>"

Practically the goal is to bring out your two boss monsters, <strong>Dinomorphia Kentregina </strong>and <strong>Dinomorphia Resturm</strong>, as soon as possible. An easy way to do this is the following: <ol>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Dinomorphia Therizia</strong></li>  	<li>Activate Therizia's effect and set from the deck to the field the trap card <strong>Dinomorphia Frenzy</strong></li>  	<li>During your opponent's Main Phase you activate Dinomorphia Frenzy to fusion summon <strong>Dinomorphia Kentregina </strong>(I usually send as materials Dinomorphia Stealthbegia from the Extra Deck and Dinomorphia Diplos from my Main Deck)</li>  	<li>Activate Kentregina's effect to banish Frenzy from the GY and replicate it's effect. The target of this fusion summon is your <strong>Dinomorphia Rexsturm</strong></li> </ol> At this point of the game you have halved your LP twice meaning that thanks to Rexsturm's effect your opponent's monsters with an ATK value of 2000 or more points cannot activate their effects. However it's almost a given that you will be given the chance to lower your LP even more, making Rexsturm even more deadly.  Overally a pretty intersting deck with a unique type of gameplay, that in my opinion should see more play competitevely (if this already happens please forgive me)."

Builds that don't use Desires can play only 1 Jaguar, but I have some kind of masochistic relationship with that card (it's complicated I can't explain) so I can't help but using it. Since we always want our copy of Jaguar when playing the deck I opted for the classic 2off to secure at least a copy in case I use Desires  <strong>Flame Bufferlo </strong>(instead of Lady Debug): I feel like I don't really need to explain this but I'll do it. With 3 Cynet Minings and 3 Salamangreat Circles I think there is no need for Debug. Bufferlo instead offers 2 new cards when linked away (providing we manage to use his effect) which in my opinion is of much importance since those 2 cards may be extends (Parallel Exceed for instance), handtraps or Called-by.  <strong>Accesscode Talker </strong>(2off): I know some of you are wondering about that choice. Well it's a way to ensure your final attack will surely pass through, meaning that it's just a consistency choice as it is with @Ignisters. That's also the reason I decided to play 1 Heatleo instead of the classic 2.  <strong>Dark Ruler No More </strong>(3off - Side Deck): Drnm, as this card's name is abbreviated is arguably one of the best (if not the best) going 2nd cards in the game for this format. People could say that Droplet has a bigger impact. That's not wrong but please let me explain even if you think it is wrong. So Salamangreat being mostly a control deck prefers to have cards to use for control (traps, handtraps, etc.). So with using Droplet you may have to give up on such cards. On the other hand Drnm does not cut down your hand size and is a budget card nowadays thanks to it's most recent reprint. My reasoning may be wrong in this choice, so if you have some other idea please do explain in the comments (by using arguments not like some screaming chimpanzees).  <strong>Rivarly of the Warlords </strong>(3off - Side Deck): Another card that allows controlling the game. If we exclude Bagooska all your monsters that can exist on our field are Cyberse so we are not largely affected. To be honest the debate here lies within the dilemma of using Rivarly or Gozen Match. My reasoning of using the former is the fact that it can shutdown engines like Brave, P.U.N.K or Therion when used in decks of not the same type which is usually the case.  Handtraps  Any proper player should know that the handtraps used in a deck are chosen based in the decks you will face in the tournament you are going to participate or your friends' decks if you play more casually. Nevertheless there are handtraps like Ash Blossom and Effect Veiler who have a big impact on both combo and control decks. So I will refrain from explaining why I am using these 2 and instead explain my reasons for the other hts included  <strong>D.D.</strong> <strong>Crow</strong>: This particular handtrap is a good budget option for most recent formats. Nowadays with the Scythe lock still being around and it's ability to banish any card from the opponent's GY I'm pretty sure it can bring headaches to players that like their GY  <strong>Nibiru </strong>(Side Deck): Nibiru is a high impact handtrap that can make most opponents cry. The reason why I felt like I have to explain this choice of mine is the fact that in this deck is used as a control going 2nd option against combo decks which always are on high spirits.  <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird </strong>(Side Deck): Okay I now people will ask why to use this handtrap in a format when no Dragon Link exists. Yeah I know you guys are right and Ghost Ogre or Ghost Belle can be better choices. But, what makes me want to use Droll is the return of Monkeyboard and of course the return of the 2nd copy of Benten."

A","This is an attempt at a pure P.U.N.K. list, using Jet Synchron and Halq to enable Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity. This deck has two main lines: opening one of the P.U.N.K. starters with an extender (Red Hared Hasty Horse, Gizmek Orochi, or Psychic Wheeleder), or opening a P.U.N.K. starter with no extender. I didn't include Ash Blossom, Nibiru, or Crossout Designator in this list to keep it semi-budget, but I will upload another list with a more optimized build using those cards.  &nbsp;  Our starters are Ze Amin, Sharakusai and another P.U.N.K. in hand, Emergency Teleport, Ogre Dance, or Foxy Tune. If we open Ze Amin, we search Foxy Tune after summoning, use Foxy Tune to summon Sharakusai, and continue with the combo listed below. If we open Emergency Teleport we can do the same thing, searching Ze Amin, or we can summon Sharakusai if we have a P.U.N.K. in hand. Ogre Dance searches either Ze Amin or Sharakusai, and Foxy Tune does the same. Make sure to use your Ogre Dance for a search before continuing the combo, as we will need a Dark in grave. Also, always use your Ze Amin search, grabbing Ogre Dance if we already have Foxy Tune.  Once we have Sharakusai and another P.U.N.K. in hand or on field, we want to use our extenders. First summon  Cupid Fore, then Psychic Wheeleder, if you have them. Activate Sharakusai to fusion summon Rising Carp using a monster in hand, or on field if you don't have a monster in hand. Activate Rising Carp to summon a Deer Note and a Madame Spider or Wa Gon from deck (preferably Madame Spider). If you only opened one extender, normal summon a P.U.N.K. from hand, then link off the extender and the P.U.N.K. for your Halqifibrax, using Halq to search Jet Synchron. Syncho summon Chaos Ruler using Deer Note and your other P.U.N.K. on field, activating Deer Note, then Chaos Ruler. Summon Sharakusai off of Deer Note and add a monster to hand off of Chaos Ruler (preferably a hand trap). Synch off Chaos Ruler and Jet Synchron for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, then use Jet Synchron in grave to return it to the field, and use Chaos Ruler's effect to return it to the field, as well.  Now, on your opponent's turn, you should have at least one trap (searched off of Madame Spider), one hand trap (from Chaos Ruler, if we're lucky), Sharakusai's ability to synch into Amazing Dragon for a few bounces, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss's effect negation, and Halq into Formula Synchron into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity to stop your opponent form activating cards and effects.  &nbsp;  Our line is much less exciting if we don't open any extenders. We still make Rising Carp off of Sharakusai, but instead of going for Halqifibrax and Chaos Ruler, we make Draco Berserker of the Tenyi, summoning back Sharakusai off of Deer Note. We are playing three Pot of Avarice to shuffle back our P.U.N.K.s; specifically Rising Carp, which we can use on following turns to make another Amazing Dragon or Psychic End Punisher. If we get Ash Blossomed, we can sometimes still extend a bit. Gossip Shadow is in the deck to allow for followup after getting Ashed on our Ze Amin/E-Tele/Foxy Tune as long as we have a Psychic Wheeleder and a Lv 3 P.U.N.K. in hand. If we know that the opponent is playing Nibiru, and we open Psychic Wheeleder and an Emergency Teleport or Foxy Tune, we can make Gossip Shadow before committing to our Draco Berserker line.  &nbsp;  With a Red Hared Hasty Horse, we can instead make Chaos Ruler or Draco Berserker, and with Gizmek Orochi we can make a level 11 instead. Satellite Warrior is in our extra deck so that if we get stuck on Halqifibrax with a level 8 on field or a Gizmek Orochi in grave, we can make Satellite Warrior off of our Formula Synchron summon. Unfortunately, without Crossout Designator we don't have much play through Nibiru. If you have any ideas on what would help this deck to survive a Nibiru, please comment down below.  &nbsp;  That's all I have for this deck, I hope you like it and please let me know if there are any changes you would make!"

I also love that it is cheap. I went from P1-D3 with this deck with an 80% win rate. The deck is very fair and tempo oriented, Think of it like a control deck but without the floodgates. Instead you win by trading 1 for 1s with your opponent but since your cards also generate card advantage you win eventually gassing them out.  Best starter to open is Tincan as it tutors other Kozmo cards out of your deck."

This deck is interesting because you have a very large amount of Ancient Warriors cards available to use but you don't have the best play enablers that are used in a competitive version of the deck in the card game so you <strong>explore other cool aspects of the Ancient Warriors archetype to build plays</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Explanation of the ""Ancient Warriors"" (""AW"") cards</strong>:  One way to fix most of the effects of ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters is to <strong>separate them by their Attributes</strong> because the Monsters that have the same Attribute share some effects that have the <strong>same activation condition or have the same objective</strong> as for example all WATER Monsters have an Ignition effect of adding an ""AW"" Card to the hand, what differs is whether it will add from the Deck or GY to the hand and whether it will be Monster or Spell/Trap. And they also <strong>have an Opponent Interaction effect</strong> that activates whenever you use another ""Ancient Warriors"" Monster's effect.  Basically the <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" WATER</strong> Monsters <strong>send Continuous Spell/Trap to the GY</strong> to add an ""Ancient Warriors"" Continuous Spell/Trap to the hand, with <a data-name=""Graceful Zhou Gong"">Graceful Zhou Gong</a> <strong>adding from the Deck</strong> and <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> <strong>adding from the GY</strong>. You can only use Eccentric Lu Jing's effect if you first have a legal target in the GY which means that among the Normal Summons of the deck it is the one that <strong>most needs you to have already made other plays</strong> before you can send a Continuous Spell/Trap that you control for the GY. They have an <strong>interaction effect that activates when you use another ""AW"" Monster's effect</strong>, with <a data-name=""Graceful Zhou Gong"">Graceful Zhou Gong</a> being a <strong>Monster Negate</strong> until end of turn as an Infinite Impermanence and <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> a <strong>Spell/Trap Pop</strong> like a Mystical Space Typhoon.  <a data-name=""Deceptive Jia Wen"">Deceptive Jia Wen</a> is from the <strong>FIRE Attribute</strong> and has a simple Ignition effect on the field of <strong>sending a Continuous Spell/Trap to the GY</strong> and Halve ATK of two Monsters on the field which works for you to be able to play the <strong>Spells/Traps of ""Ancient Warriors"" to the GY and trigger their good effects</strong>. The second effect depends on an <strong>opponent's card being destroyed</strong> and allows you to add any ""Ancient Warriors"" Card from the GY to the hand.  <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> is the last of the <strong>Level 4 ""Ancient Warriors"" available</strong> in the Format and has <strong>WIND Attribute</strong> and is the <strong>best extender avaliable</strong> because whenever added to the hand by the effect of an ""AW"" card you can Special Summon it to the field. And on the field he is an <strong>Omni Negate of Spell/Trap Activation by sending an ""Ancient Warriors"" Continuous Spell/Trap to the GY</strong>. He is also an Omni Negate from Monster Effect however you need to control ""Virtuous Liu Xuan"" which doesn't exist in Normal/Rare Format.  <a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a> is from <strong>FIRE Attribute</strong> and is basically a <strong>Battle Phase Hand Trap for ""Ancient Warriors"" monsters</strong> entering the field in the <strong>Damage Step taking 1000ATK from the opponent's monster and he will still destroy an opponent's card when he sees his a card being destroyed</strong>. An excellent card in this format for the ease of cleaning multiple opponent cards at once in addition to <strong>protecting your OTHERS ""Ancient Warriors"" from being destroyed by battle</strong>.  <a data-name=""Valiant Zhang De"">Valiant Zhang De</a> has <strong>WIND Attribute</strong> and is practically the <strong>Boss Monster from ""Ancient Warriors"" available in N/R Format</strong>. It is Special Summoned from the hand if you <strong>control 2 or more ""Ancient Warriors""</strong> and gains 300ATK for each opponent's monster during your turn and if your opponent controls more monsters than you it can make up to 2 Attacks in the Battle Phase. <a data-name=""Loyal Guan Yun"">Loyal Guan Yun</a> is what we <strong>can call Normal/Rare Format Pseudo-</strong><a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a> because it only enters the field by Special Summon from the hand if <strong>only the opponent controls Monsters and its interaction effect can only be used if your opponent controls more monsters than you</strong>. He, like the <a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a>, protects his OTHERS ""Ancient Warriors"" monsters, only in this case he <strong>protects them from card effect targets</strong>. It gets a lot worse if you're going first or draw it when you already have an established field but it's still possible to Special Summon it out of hand with <a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a>.  <a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a> is the <strong>ROTA of ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters in Normal/Rare format</strong>. All you have to do is <strong>Normal or Special any ""Ancient Warriors"" to trigger its effect</strong> and add an ""AW"" Monster with a different name from the Deck to the hand. <strong>This pairs well with the</strong> <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> that Special Summons. Also when it is <strong>sent from the s/t zone to the GY you can Special Summon an ""Ancient Warriors"" from your hand</strong> functioning as a Double Extender. It only stays on the field for <strong>2 Standby Phase after activation</strong> which means you always want to send it to the GY during the same turn of its activation so you don't lose card advantage and for that we have the <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Level Monsters 4 to perform this function</strong>. <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> has a simple field interaction effect similar to <a data-name=""Deceptive Jia Wen"">Deceptive Jia Wen</a>'s of cutting ATK in half. But its main effect is <strong>when sent to the GY and you must control 2 ""Ancient Warriors"" of DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES</strong> to activate it which is to <strong>put 1 ""AW"" Continuous Spell/Trap from Hand or Deck Face-Up on the Field</strong>. As you first need to have 2 ""AW"" of different Attributes on the field it needs you to establish a setup prior to its activation to work but the deck is competent in leaving this effect alive. <a data-name=""East-by-South Winds"">East-by-South Winds</a> is the <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Continuous Spell</strong> which makes the deck competitive in N/R Format because <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters are cards that you will rarely use as an Extra Deck Monster material</strong> since the LINK-2 <a data-name=""Double Dragon Lords"">Double Dragon Lords</a> is not available and you need to maintain field presence to control the match. So it will be <a data-name=""East-by-South Winds"">East-by-South Winds</a> that will do the <strong>job of you being able to clear any threat from the opponent's field</strong> because it basically <strong>has no effect on the field and yes you just want to send it from the s/t zone to the GY</strong> and with that it will make your <strong>opponent unable to respond to the activation of the effects of your ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters</strong> and they even gain an additional effect during the Battle Phase whenever <strong>declaring an Attack will destroy an Opponent's card without targeting</strong>. With that you take control of the game and put the opponent in Time because on your next turn you will most likely have lethal damage on the table to win the duel. The Trap <a data-name=""Defense of Changban"">Defense of Changban</a> <strong>protects your monsters from Spells/Traps during the opponent's Battle Phase</strong> until the end of the Damage Step so you avoid taking cards such as <a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a> which is very annoying in this format. It also works as a <a data-name=""Negate Attack"">Negate Attack</a> as the <strong>opponent will not be able to target your ""AW"" Monsters for Attacks</strong> and generally you will only have them as an attack target option. And <strong>in GY she can banish herself when the opponent declares an Attack to Special Summon an ""Ancient Warriors"" straight from the Deck</strong>. The only detail is that you can only use one of the effects per turn, but it's simple for you to make combos that can send the Defense of Changban to the GY on your turn to use the GY effect on the opponent's turn.  It is because of <strong>interaction effects</strong> like the ones presented above that <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Cards gain a lot of value when you go second for being able to deal with the cards that the opponent has on the field via the engine</strong>. So it's always <strong>recommended to go second</strong> with this deck to get the most potential out of your cards, plus some of them <strong>have effects that are only useful if your opponent controls Monsters</strong> like <a data-name=""Loyal Guan Yun"">Loyal Guan Yun</a> <strong>or depends on you going to the Battle Phase</strong> to do something like Halve the opponent's monster's ATK with <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a>, enter by Special Summon and lower the opponent's monster's ATK by 1000 with <a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a>, be able to attack twice each Battle Phase with <a data-name=""Valiant Zhang De"">Valiant Zhang De</a>, or Prevent that the opponent activates Spell/Traps eff until the end of the Damage Step with the <a data-name=""Defense of Changban"">Defense of Changban</a> or the best of all available options which is <a data-name=""East-by-South Winds"">East-by-South Winds</a> which prevents the opponent from responding to their effects from ""AW"" monsters besides them destroy a card without targeting each time they declare an Attack.  //////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Comments</strong>:  One of the <strong>most common plays</strong> is using <a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a> <strong>to add</strong> <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> to the hand that will be Special Summoned.  <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> can <strong>negate the activation of his own Spells/Traps that you activate on the field</strong> and that way you can even on turn 1 make great plays that wouldn't be possible involving other Archetype Monsters. One of the best moves in the deck is using <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> to <strong>place the Trap</strong> <a data-name=""Defense of Chagban"">Defense of Chagban</a> Face-Up. And then you <strong>send the Trap to the GY</strong> with the <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> or <a data-name=""Graceful Zhou Gong"">Graceful Zhou Gong</a> so that it becomes a <strong>Special Summon from the Deck on the opponent's turn</strong> which is usually the ""Hand Trap"" <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a> </span>because it protects from destruction per battle. An example of application of these cards is you <strong>activated</strong> <a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a> and <strong>Normal Summoned</strong> <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> and added <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> <strong>to the hand</strong> that entered the field and then you activate <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> and with that <strong>you can negate its activation</strong> with the <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> when <strong>sending the Three Visits to the GY</strong> and with that trigger the effect of <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> to put the <a data-name=""Defense of Changban"">Defense of Changban</a> face-up on the field and then use the effect of the <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> to <strong>send the Defense of Changban to the GY and add the Three Visits from Follow Up</strong> and leave the Trap in the GY to Special Summon an ""AW"" from the Deck on your opponent's turn when declaring an Attack on your monsters.  <a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a>'s <strong>hand trap effect becomes a pop in the damage step if your monster destroys the opponent's</strong> and your opponent won't be able to chain set cards it has from not being in the Battle Step. In addition to its <strong>protection effect from the other ""AW"" Monsters against destruction by battle</strong> it makes its field presence very solid.  <a data-name=""Link Apple"">Link Apple</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> are on the decklist because you <strong>don't care about the Extra Deck</strong> so their usage doesn't conflict with the deck. <strong>Link Apple</strong> is basically an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> of the N/R format if you don't banish a LINK Monster with its effect in hand and I don't even use LINK Monsters in the Extra Deck to prevent it from activating the Special Summon effect instead of drawing cards. <strong>Punishment</strong> <strong>destroys any monster on the field</strong> no matter its ATK and if it is a monster with <strong>1700ATK or less you can send the</strong> <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Wagon"">Fossil Machine Skull Wagon</a> to the GY which is a <strong>Spell/Trap Pop</strong>. On the other hand, <a data-name=""Fog Blade"">Fog Blade</a> has very good applications in this deck since you won't always go second so it's a good interaction card to set going first and it's a <strong>Continuous Trap which has synergy with the Level 4 ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters that can send it to the GY to activate its effects</strong>. Also in specific cases you can use the <a data-name=""Fog Blade"">Fog Blade</a> <strong>on your own monsters to prevent your opponent from targeting them for Attacks</strong> ensuring they survive the Battle Phase. And it is not Hard Once Per Turn so if you have 2 Fog Blade set you can use them in the same turn and negate monster effects twice.  //////////////////////////////////////////"

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.

For example, summoner monk can  be used to bring out blastfan, searching either genex ally birdman to make a level 7 synchro, or an r-genex oracle,  which summons itself , enabling a halq line with an extra body on field, maybe getting a scythe lock. Furthermore, it could also bring out performapal pendulum sorcerer, which can pop monk and itself adding monkeyboard and lizardraw, then monkeyoard adds odd eyes synchron, setting up a pendulum summon, an extra draw off of lizardraw, and a lvl 8 synchro monster using odd-eyes synchron and monkeyboard. Parallel exceed, jet synchron, and plaguespreader zombie are forms of extending either halq lines or pend lines."

Idea is to adopt a duel strategy of searching and drawing Exodia pieces. Use torrential tribute to destroy your own monsters if your opponent won't do it, especially useful when combined with double summons. If your opponent does manage to summon a heavy-hitter - mystic mine will lock them to an extent, allowing you time to gather the pieces. Swift scarecrow can also be your last line of defence.  Always magic mallet if you do not have any Exodia pieces in hand. The only cards you don't want to shuffle back in with a mallet on the first turn is trader/supply-squad/tribute.  Probably the most OP card is draw of fate - lets you stack 3 pieces of exodia on top and if you have a cardcar in hand."

Evo-Singularity is actually such a good card it’s worth playing three trap trick alone for this incredible trap. Here’s how it works.  You pay the cost of targeting an Evoltile and an Evolsaur in your graveyard, summon an Evolzar from your extra, then attach the monsters targeted as material. It’s that simple, you can get a free boss, you get to choose from one who can get two monster negates, one who can stop two summons, or one who can Omni negate.  Then you support those monsters by backrow! This combination can overwhelm opponents pretty quickly and good enough hands can beat some really good decks."

Red Dragon Archfiends focus on Synchro Spamming through their sub-archetype ""Resonators,"" which were also used by Jack in the anime, with non-Tuners and backrow to boot. This particular build utilizes the advantage that the ""Rokket"" cards provide. Rokket Tracer can serve as a Tuner or as a non-Tuner by destroying itself to Special Summon Rokket Recharger, whose effect itself can be helpful in the duel, and can serve as a smaller Tuner by destroying itself to Special Summon Rokket Synchron, which is also useful for extension and recovery. Rokket Tracer is also excellent for combo'ing with the Spells or useless Resonators, as you can destroy them to Special Summon Recharger and make an easy Level 8 Synchro.  The best end boards are always gained through the help of Crimson Resonator. Crimson Resonator is an insanely powerful card that Special Summons itself if you control no monsters, which saves your Normal Summon for an extender or just a Level 4 for the Synchro Summon of Red Rising Dragon. Red Rising Dragon is a very valuable part of the deck, as it is a Level 6 Synchro which is easy to make through a Level 2 Resonator and a level 4 non-Tuner like Wildwind. Red Rising Dragon's effect revives a Resonator from the Graveyard, most likely the one you used for its Synchro Summon, allowing you to immediately go for another Synchro Summon, usually for Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend of Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon.  Chaos Ruler is great because none of the good Synchros require specifically a Red Dragon Archfiend, instead requiring any DARK Dragon Synchro Monster, and Chaos Ruler can mill 5 upon Summon. This is an amazing effect because Synkron Resonator and Wandering King Wildwind are both DARKs you can add back from the effect, you can recycle dumped Resonators with Synkron or any dumped card with Burning Soul, and I would hate to fail to mention that milling Red Reign will allow you to add it right to your hand on your next Synchro Summon. Milling ""The Great Soul"" also gives you access to a negation of an opponent's monster effect that activates anywhere, and the fact that it's a Trap and banishes itself from the Graveyard as cost makes it even stronger, as most opponents would need to already have an omni-negate present on their field in order to negate it, and this strengthens your chains with Supernova, Red Reign, and Abyss disruptions.  When going first, provided that you didn't brick (which happens a lot, albeit less frequently with this build than with others), you should be able to make Red Rising Dragon, hopefully with a Crimson Resonator to revive. Then you can use Crimson Resonator to Special Summon a Synkron Resonator and a Creation Resonator from Deck, then you can use your three Tuners and your non-Tuner Synchro Monster to Synchro Summon the almighty Red Supernova Dragon. Even by himself, he can be a game-ender if the opponent doesn't have the resources to bait his effect out before making their main plays. However, it's usually possible to secure a Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss alongside him for added security.  Alternatively, if you've drawn a hand that can make Red Supernova Dragon, and you've drawn Burning Soul, you can prevent your opponent from playing the game. Simply make Red Rising Dragon once more using Crimson Resonator and Special Summon your Synkron and Creation Resonators. Alternatively, if you have a copy of The Great Soul, or a Trap Trick to gain access to one, then all you need is the Crimson Resonator, or even just a Red Resonator. Now, instead of making Supernova, make Scarlight or Chaos Ruler. Chaos Ruler is usually preferred, since you can potentially score a DARK monster, Red Reign, or The Great Soul off of the mill. Set Burning Soul and maybe a Trap Card, then end your turn.  At the start of your opponent's Main Phase 1, activate Burning Soul. Add whatever card to your hand, then perform your Synchro Summon, tuning your Level 1 and 3 Resonators to your Level 8 DARK Dragon Synchro Monster to Synchro Summon the also almighty Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King of All Mouthfuls - <em>ahem</em> - King Calamity. Just like another monster with Calamity in its name (or rather the plural version), this monster makes it so your opponent cannot play the game by preventing them from activating cards or the effects of cards on their fields. On top of this, it's a Spell Speed 4 effect, meaning it cannot be responded to with any card of the game. Now all your opponent can do is Set a monster and maybe some backrow and pray to whatever deity they worship that you don't have a hand coherent enough to kill them next turn, which seems a little optimistic, given you added a card from your Graveyard to your hand, you're drawing another card, and you likely have a Wildwind and/or a Red Rising Dragon to activate for more advantage.  Of course, this list is not 100% perfect. Some ratios can be adjusted to fit how you'd like to play. I've experimented with things like Dawnwalker, Duskwalker, and the Assault Mode package for easy Synchros, adding more Chaos cards like Chaos Valkyrie which is an easy-to-summon Level 4 and a LIGHT for recurring Chaos Ruler, and much, much more. This is simply the easiest, most reliable version of the deck that I've made thus far. I hope this is helpful for your future duel-ruling endeavors, Kings."

The bulk of the deck is comprised of the VW strategy going trying to get out crystal wing and dragoon (caliga would be a suitable replacement if you want cards in hand for next turn plays). The P.U.N.K engine here allows for Gabu to be added to hand and can either set up a VW name on board or set up gossip before 5 summons. The swordsoul engine allows easy access to baronne and crystal wing if VW line gets shut down. Tons of options and varying combos make playing the deck fun and different almost every game. Please let me know what you think and if you have any advice! Thank you.

A simple way to <strong>RANK-6 in the deck</strong> is you have <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire's Desire"">Vampire's Desire</a> in hand + any monster on the field because you send <a data-name=""Vampire Grace"">Vampire Grace</a> to the GY and Tribute Summon the <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a> that brings <a data-name=""Scarlet Scourge"">Scarlet Scourge</a> to the field that gives Grace's Reborn and that way you have RANK-6 play. Another way to RANK-6 is with <a data-name=""Scarlet Scourge"">Scarlet Scourge</a> reborn <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> that adds <a data-name=""Vampire's Desire"">Vampire's Desire</a> for you to send a Vampire Level6 like <a data-name=""Vampire Grace"">Vampire Grace</a> to the GY and the <strong>Vampire Retainer becomes Level6</strong> and you make RANK-6 that way.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////////////<strong>Combo: Vampire Familiar in GY + Vampire Retainer</strong>  <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> eff send <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> from Hand to GY and SS from GY Familiar eff pay500LP Add <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a> NS Shadow Vampire and eff SS <a data-name=""Scarlet Scourge"">Scarlet Scourge</a> from Deck and eff pay1000LP Reborn <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> Retainer eff pay500LP Add <a data-name=""Vampire Takeover"">Vampire Takeover</a> for example  Gamestate: Shadow Vampire(Lv5) + Scarlet Scourge(Lv6) + Retainer(Lv2) + Spell/Trap Vampire  /////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combo: (o-Bolan + Retainer) + Vampire Card in Hand + Scarlet Scourge</strong>  <a data-name=""&lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;Jack-o-B&lt;/span&gt;olan""><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Jack-o-B</span>olan</a> eff send <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> to GY and SS from Hand Retainer eff send Vampire Card to GY and SS Retainer eff pay500LP Add <a data-name=""Vampire's Desire"">Vampire's Desire</a> Activate Vampire's Desire and tgt Retainer to send <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> to gy and its become Level1  NS <a data-name=""Scarlet Scourge"">Scarlet Scourge</a> and eff pay1000LP Reborn Familiar Familiar eff pay500LP Add <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a>(Follow Up)  Gamestate: o-Bolan + Scarlet Scourge + Familiar /in Hand: Shadow Vampire  /////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combo: (Samurai Skull + Familiar) + o-Bolan</strong>  NS <a data-name=""Samurai Skull"">Samurai Skull</a> and eff send <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> to gy Retainer eff send <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> from Hand to GY to SS Retainer eff pay500LP Add Spell/Trap Vampire Familiar eff send Spell/Trap Vampire from Hand to GY to SS ***(Family eff pay500LP add <a data-name=""Vampire Grace"">Vampire Grace</a>) <a data-name=""Jack-o-Bolan"">Jack-o-Bolan</a> eff send Grace to GY to SS from Hand  Gamestate: Samurai Skull + Retainer + Familiar + o-Bolan /in GY: Grace  ***(If you didn't spend your Normal Summon you can add <a data-name=""Vampire Shadow"">Vampire Shadow</a>) NS Vampire Shadow and eff SS <a data-name=""Scarlet Scourge"">Scarlet Scourge</a>/<a data-name=""Vampire Duke"">Vampire Duke</a> from Deck  //////////////////////////////////////<strong>Comments:</strong>  I decided to adopt a choice of Vampire Tribute Summon monsters (Level 5 and Level 6) more focused on how you <strong>would play Vampire in Yugioh's current format</strong> where the strategy of <strong>sending cards from the opponent's deck to the GY is not good</strong> given the amount of cards of the 3 types: Monsters, Spells and Traps that are excellent in the GY.  Of course, you can still <strong>interact with the opponent by sending cards from their deck to the GY</strong> using <a data-name=""Vampire Duke"">Vampire Duke</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Grace"">Vampire Grace</a> to trigger the Field Spell <a data-name=""Vampire Kingdom"">Vampire Kingdom</a> effect and <strong>destroy a card on the field</strong> but it's not the main focus of the deck in terms of End Board. Turn 1 usually you want to access <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a> to be your <strong>Normal Summon and bring another high Level Vampire</strong> like <a data-name=""Vampire Scarlet Scourge"">Vampire Scarlet Scourge</a> onto the field directly from the deck. I don't use more copies of <a data-name=""Shadow Vampire"">Shadow Vampire</a> because it <strong>RESTRICTS you in the Battle Phase</strong> to only be able to attack with the monster brought by Special Summon by this effect so you are harmed throughout the game by not being able to take important monsters from your opponent in the Battle Phase. Speaking of this <strong>RESTRICTION of attacking in the Battle Phase</strong>, <a data-name=""Vampire Scarlet Scourge"">Vampire Scarlet Scourge</a> itself <strong>restricts you to not being able to attack with the monster brought by its effect</strong> during the Battle Phase so you have to understand well the best way to use these effects to not lose chances of take monsters from opponent in Battle Phase.  //////////////////////////////////////  The idea behind the <strong>Vendread Engine</strong> is that it gives you <strong>more Grind Game options and aggressive plays</strong> because for example if you do the <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> + <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a> Combo you add the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> and Ritual Summon it by <strong>sending another Slayer from the deck to the GY</strong> and then use the two monsters to LINK-2 <a data-name=""Puzzlomino,"">Puzzlomino,</a> and the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> will trigger eff to add another <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a><strong> of Follow Up for the next turn</strong> at the same time it sends the <a data-name=""Vendread Striges"">Vendread Striges</a> to the GY that will <strong>come back for Special Summon in</strong> <a data-name=""Puzzlomino"">Puzzlomino</a>'s <strong>zone and that way you manipulate its Level to XYZ Summon</strong> it together with a Vampire Monster you have on the field <strong>or to interact with the opponent</strong> by match the level with the opponent's monster you want to <strong>destroy with the second Puzzlomino effect</strong>. Another way to interact is to make the <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> in place of the Puzzlomino and in the same way as before you bring the <a data-name=""Vendread Striges"">Vendread Striges</a> <strong>in the zone it points and exchange its control</strong> with the opponent stealing a Boss Monster he has on the field giving in exchange a 500ATK monster.  This engine then is <strong>interaction, enabler to XYZ Summon as mentioned before and Follow Up</strong> because you will Ritual Summon the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> again on your next turn and then team up with a Level 6 Vampire monster to make one of your <strong>RANK-6 available</strong>.  <strong>Details of this engine</strong>: After Summoning the <strong>first</strong> <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> you always <strong>use it as LINK material and not as XYZ material</strong> because if you don't you can't trigger eff when it's sent to the GY because it's no longer considered Ritual Summoned Card. The second detail of this engine is that the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> will be <strong>destroyed in the End Phase of the opponent's turn</strong> and that's why it's better to use it as a LINK or XYZ material on your own turn to avoid losing card advantage. The third detail is that sending the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> from your <strong>hand to the GY is free as you can Ritual Summon it in the GY</strong> so it's easy to <strong>pay the cost of cards</strong> like <a data-name=""Jack-o-Bolan"">Jack-o-Bolan</a> and <a data-name=""Performapal PupperUp"">Performapal PupperUp</a>.  //////////////////////////////////////  Using the <a data-name=""Performapal PupperUp"">Performapal PupperUp</a> makes sense in this deck even with the <strong>downside of paying life points</strong> because you want to send your <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> Starters to the GY if they come in the Starting Hand and also because the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> can be Ritual Summoned from the GY with Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a> so you don't lose card advantage by being the best <strong>consistency card option available</strong>. The trick for you <strong>not to take too much damage</strong> in the resolution of the <a data-name=""Performapal PupperUp"">Performapal PupperUp</a> and not being able to <strong>activate the effects of the Vampire monsters later</strong> is you start activating the Continuous Spell <a data-name=""Vampire's Domain"">Vampire's Domain</a> or Field Spell <a data-name=""Vampire Kingdom"">Vampire Kingdom</a> and setting the Spell <a data-name=""Vampire's Desire"">Vampire's Desire</a> or <a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a> and giving Normal Summon the <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Samurai Skull"">Samurai Skull</a> to <strong>have in hand only the cards that will be discarded to the GY</strong> avoiding taking 4k or 5k damage.  <a data-name=""Jack-o-Bolan"">Jack-o-Bolan</a> also has the function of sending his <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> <strong>Starters to the GY</strong> and he also has the synergy of being <strong>able to Reborn one of the Zombie monsters on the opponent's turn</strong> for you to generate field presence/Follow Up and even interaction if Reborn from <a data-name=""Vampire Duke"">Vampire Duke</a> while Field Spell <a data-name=""Vampire Kingdom"">Vampire Kingdom</a> is activated. This Monster Reborn effect is very useful for even you to bring the <a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a> back to the field which is a 2400ATK monster that will be difficult for the opponent to take out of the field which makes the <strong>protection effect of RANK-6</strong> <a data-name=""Dragonlark Pairen"">Dragonlark Pairen</a> alive and will still make it possible to make <strong>more RANK-6 plays</strong> on the return turn.  Tip: Whenever you are going to use the effect of <a data-name=""Vampire Duke"">Vampire Duke</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Grace"">Vampire Grace</a>, <strong>never choose ""Trap"" because all decks in the format use</strong> <a data-name=""Paleozoic"">Paleozoic</a> <strong>Traps</strong> and choosing <strong>""Monster"" is also a bad choice</strong> given how many excellent cards the vast majority of decks wants to send to the GY so the best option is to <strong>force him to send ""Spells""</strong> because that's the least that will generate an advantage if his deck manages to use it.  The <strong>RANK-6 you always want to do first</strong> in the deck is <a data-name=""Dragonlark Pairen"">Dragonlark Pairen</a> because it will simply <strong>Reborn the</strong> <a data-name=""Vampire Familiar"">Vampire Familiar</a> and <a data-name=""Vampire Retainer"">Vampire Retainer</a> Starters during the <strong>next two Standby Phases</strong> for you to quickly gain advantage in addition to <strong>protecting itself from destruction by battle or card effect while a GY Special Summoned Monster is on the field</strong> making it a very difficult card to deal with.  /////////////////////////////////////"

The plays in this deck get a tad intricate so I apologize if I lose some of the detail, playing it yourself and reading the cards should help where needed.  &nbsp;  The goal of this deck is to enable high attack monsters to be uninterrupted in destroying your opponents lifepoints. It does so through effect monsters such as Calamities and Zeus.  Commonly this deck has enough SS power to outdo the negates found commonly, and options for plays after most negates though less optimal.  If at all possible, your field will scale according to performance, allowing you to potentially get monsters such as Infinitrack Megaclops on the first or second turn.  If megaclops is on the field, ensure good control/power XYZ are in your graveyard. Frequently use this effect to eliminate potential threats while creating further ones for your opponent, and restricting their field of play through the summoned monsters effects.  Otherwise, create special summoning loops and use simple effects like Citadel and Fortress to destroy one backfield card and all of your opponents monsters under 3,000 attack.  &nbsp;  Furthermore just play intelligently, if Superdreadnought Dora is on the field along with Citadel, use Dora's effects on itself and then activate citadel with Dora as the target. All of your monsters survive, all of your opponents monsters under 3,200 atk are destroyed and doesnt target.  This deck summons allot of monsters and allows you to construct and reconstruct your field in order to best overcome obstacles laid infront of you. Sometimes you'll be out of options, but I've never had any problems getting to platinum running this deck."

Circular adds a new take on Mathmech, expanding it's combo into just a single card. Your usual endboard ends out with Superfactorial, Heatsoul, some set traps and hand traps. The Mathmech combo of this deck can be utilized into a lot of Cyberse decks. Here is how to perform it:  1: Circular effect, send Sigma to the graveyard, special summon circular  2: Sigma effect, special summon itself  3: Circular triggers off of Sigma's summon, adding Superfactorial  4: Xyz into Alembertain, Alembertain adds either Addition or Subtraction  5: Special summon the added monster  6: Link into Splash Mage, special summon any monster  7: Link into Heatsoul  Heatsoul draw one card  Set any traps you drew from the draw phase or Heatsoul and pass turn!  The beauty about Heatsoul is that you can draw during your opponent's turn, giving you either more hand traps for your opponent to face or giving you follow-up. Superfactorial can make Laplacian, which can send a card in hand to the graveyard, a monster they control to the graveyard, or a spell and trap card they control to the graveyard. It's a great way to troublesome cards from the field while also removing any possible extenders or follow-up in their hand. This deck can also OTK utilizing Update Jammer, which can make Accesscode be able to attack twice. Since you're only able to attack with one monster when using Circular, this is excellent. If you want to see more Mathmech, you can add in a second Nabla to get the Mathmech engine to pop out more. Cynet Mining can discard your Eldlich cards, making both your engines synchronize by discarding a card you want to hit the graveyard to add Circular. This deck doesn't fair very well against cards like Dimension Shifter.

This deck focuses on getting Halq out asap then grabbing deskbot 001 and going into Auroradon. This will begin your combo to go into true king.  Sac Auroradon and a token to go into O-lion, then O-lion and a token goes into Rose Maiden. Rose maiden and deskbot 001 go into coral dragon. Then coral dragon  and a token go into Crocodragon. Then using Rose maidens effect you can banish it to bring back Coral dragon, then Coral dragon and another token goes into  Shenshen, Overlay shenshen and crocodragon to get True King of all calamities. Summon it in defense, set your traps/distruption you may have and the game is very  close to being over. Last thing to do is turn your Priority switch to On so you can use its effect on their draw step to prevent getting kaiju'd before you can use  its effect.  &nbsp;  The amazing thing about this combo it's a 1 card combo meaning you do all of that without losing your entire hand, it opens up your next turn to OTK or really put yourself super ahead of the game."

I thought they were the end of Yugioh and blah blah blah. But I've been playing with them for a while now, and a good chunk of my favorite archetypes are heavily focused on links: Tenyis, Krawlers, Live Twins, Mekk-Knights, and of course World Chalice. For those who aren't aware, World Chalice is an archetype that focuses on spamming normal monsters to use for link summoning a ton of monsters. It also used to include a busted synchro card, but that's been banned forever and probably will keep being banned forever, so pour one out for the real play maker of the deck. Gone but not forgotten. Anyways, your end boards in this deck could range from super cool link bosses like a Borrel or an Arrival Cyberse or even a Topologic. All of these are solid options, Arrival Cyberse just requires a ton of investment to be Kaiju bait, and I personally just hate the Borrels and Topologics. So, we'll be playing the deck as Takahashi intended and making Avramax or Apo instead. Keep in mind that any of those other options can absolutely work as well, it's just all personal preference.  First, let's go through a quick card by card of the deck and side deck.  <strong><span>MAIN DECK</span></strong>: <p><strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>3x -<a data-name=""Beckoned by the World Chalice"">Beckoned by the World Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Chosen by the World Chalice"">Chosen by the World Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Crowned by the World Chalice"">Crowned by the World Chalice</a>: Yes, they are all normal monsters. Yes, you will brick sometimes. But you need three of each since starting your combo basically requires a normal monster to be summoned. Some people run two of each, but unless you run a supplementary engine that spams normal monsters (like the Agent of Creation - Venus), you need as many of these cards as you can run.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Chalice&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Chalice""</a>: This card seems like a bit of a bizarre include at first glance, but it acts as an amazing combo extender in the deck. Since Imduk gives you an extra normal summon, you can tribute summon this card very easily during your combo and it brings out resources from deck if sent to the GY after being tribute summoned. It does add to the brick potential, so you can run one or two instead, but having more World Chalice monsters in your hand extends your plays so I try to max out on them.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a>: The archetypal Stratos that helps keep your hand full of World Chalices to extend plays. Its grave effect also allows you to send a card with a good effect in the grave (*cough* *cough* the next card) or proccing all your World Chalice link monster's effects in a pinch. Run three to ensure you see it most games, but just be warned it can't be used as link material for your combo starter.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon"">World Chalice Guardragon</a>: While the in-hand (or on-field) effect lets it work as a solid handtrap, its grave effect is what makes it so important in the deck. It lets you summon a normal monster from grave to a zone a link monster points to, which helps extend your plays that extra bit farther to end on a more formidable board than you otherwise could. Run three but try not to normal summon it unless you have no other choices since it does even less than Lee does when normal summoned.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>: On paper, Rescue Rabbit sounds awesome. It fetches two materials straight from deck by only taking your normal summon and it dodges Called by the Grave by banishing itself. It also happens to be the biggest handtrap bait in the deck, so you'll rarely see it pop off. Still, run three since in those one in a million games where it does work, it makes the best end boards the deck can produce.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong><span>Spells</span></strong>:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>: Summons a normal monster straight from deck. You run nine of them, so unlike some combo decks that run just one normal monster as a target, this will always have live targets turn one. Run three because it's the best way to start your turn.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a>: As it turns out, Chosen is a psychic-type, so you get to run E-Tele in the deck. This also opens the possibility of including Gamma and/or Ghost Ogre as a both handtraps and potential combo extenders if needed.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>: Summons the dragon straight from deck while potentially setting up the grave for its effect to work. Run one because you can't run more, but if One for One ever moves off the limited list (it won't unless it's getting banned instead) run more copies. Just be warned that unlike Dai and E-Tele this has a pretty good chance to brick and is an awful card to top deck if you make it to the late game.</li>  	<li>3x -<a data-name=""World Legacy's Heart"">World Legacy's Heart</a>: This lets you refill your hand with World Chalices and offers some ok protection to your link monsters when in grave. Run three all the time.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>: A Monster Reborn if you have a free link zone open. Run two because it's searchable and a hard once-per-turn and run the actual Monster Reborn as well if you find the space for it.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""World Legacy Discovery"">World Legacy Discovery</a>: The archetypal field spell that isn't as important as most other archetypal field spells. Gives a teeny stat boost that comes up every once in a million duels and a nice recovery effect. You can run anywhere from zero to three, so if you're looking for some space to fit more handtraps or other tech cards, this is the card to trim down on to fit them in.</li>  	<li>1x -<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>: Solid handtrap defense that the deck desperately needs. Crossout might be a better choice since you can run more copies, but it requires way too much main deck space to function properly, so I never use it.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong><span>Traps</span></strong>:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>: My favorite handtrap, but it could be replaced by any other handtrap instead. Ash is always a good pick and Ghost Belle is useful against a solid number of decks. Same with Ghost Ogre and Gamma but Gamma needs an extra card's worth of space to work.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong><span>EXTRA DECK</span></strong>: <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Imduk the World Chalice Dragon"">Imduk the World Chalice Dragon</a>: You’re gonna see this card a whole lot if you play the deck. Every turn that doesn’t end immediately will summon this boi at least once, and there’s a good reason why. An extra normal summon in a deck that uses a monster who needs to be tribute summoned is just incredible. Through a normal turn you end up going through one or two, so you can shave one copy off. But personally, three always works the best for me with how many normal monsters the deck needs to link away.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Ib the World Chalice Priestess"">Ib the World Chalice Priestess</a>: This card acts like a mini towers but you’ll rarely see it used for that effect. It mostly just serves as additional extension with its grave effect as well as giving good arrows to complement Auram’s. Run two since you’ll never need the third, but you might sometimes need the second.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Auram the World Chalice Blademaster"">Auram the World Chalice Blademaster</a>: Can occasionally serve as a solid beatstick in a pinch, but you really need its tribute effect and grave effect to help extend plays. Run two for the same reason you run two Ib.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior"">Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior</a>: The original “boss monster” of the archetype. Can draw up to three cards when summoned and allows you to non-targeting send a card to the grave by sending one of your own. A good card, but you’ll only ever summon him once.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a>: The best World Legacy support card ever released other than Girsu. Two completely generic materials can set any World Legacy spell/trap from deck and the pool of good World Legacy cards is just insane. You can grab Succession as a reborn spell, Heart as extra World Chalices in hand, Clash for some attack manipulation, Awakens if you want to run a link that you’d want to summon on your opponent’s turn, Struggle as easily accessible spell/trap removal, Cliffhanger as a really funny way to shift a game in your favor, and Sorrow as a good counter trap. Run one or two depending on how many targets you put in deck.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a>: A solid boss monster to end on, especially if you summon it using I:P. Has great protection and redirects any attacks to itself while dodging targeted effects. Plus, its amazing battle phase effect helping close out games. Run one because you will only ever need one</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke"">World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke</a>: This is mostly just here because I wanted every World Chalice in the deck, but it can also help with OTKs. Especially against link-focused decks. It’s also a good Super Poly target against those decks as well, but that does sort of kill its OTK potential if you Super Poly into this card. Run one because you probably won’t even use one most of the time.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>: The best way to get World Chalice Guardragon in grave in a pinch. You’ll only ever need the one tho since it’s only used to get Guardragon in grave.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: Summoning Spider gives you the easiest access to additional tribute fodder for Chalice, but you’ll only ever need the one since past turn one, you’re trying to kill your opponent as quickly as you can.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>: Just a solid card to summon Avramax with. You won’t always have the extra material for it, but when you do you can make a very tough to out Avramax. You could also use it to summon Apo or a different boss monster to provide that same protection tho.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>: The best generic way to get negates for a deck, which this deck desperately needs to not die instantly. Only run one since you’ll only ever use one per game.</li> </ul> <strong><span>SIDE DECK</span></strong>: <ul>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Avida, Rebuilder of Worlds"">Avida, Rebuilder of Worlds</a>: This seems like a strange card to include in the side deck, but it does come up sometimes. Since this deck spams link monsters like almost no other, you can easily have the grave filled with different named links after turn 1, and if your board is broken on the next turn, you can sometimes fulfill the summoning condition on your own and just reset the gamestate in your favor. If you’re going against another link deck, this becomes even easier to achieve. And besides, you’re running World Chalices. Avida is like the very end of the World Legacy lore so you’ve gotta play it in the deck that features the very beginning of it.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</a>: Any Kaiju works here, but Gameciel is just the best. Do not play Lava Golem or Sphere Mode unless you desperately need the extra tributes though. This deck almost always needs its normal summon to start its plays, so using that up on a Lava Golem doesn’t always work super well.</li>  	<li>2x - <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>: Just another two copies of Feather Duster. This could be Twin Twisters or something like Raigeki instead, but I just like having a ton of anti-backrow insurance.</li>  	<li>1x - <a data-name=""Harpie’s Feather Duster"">Harpie’s Feather Duster</a>: The best anti-backrow card ever printed, but it isn’t always enough to break through backrow decks.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>: Helps with backrow removal that also completely ruins some Eldlich cards as well as the ever-spooky <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a>.</li>  	<li>3x - <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: You’re already running Almarduke so you might as well run a way to summon him without sending your whole field to grave. You can honestly skip this one though unless you make space for more targets for this card.</li> </ul> <strong><span>EXTRA OPTIONS</span></strong>: <ul>  	<li>More handtraps: This deck can make some space to fit in about 6-9 handtraps if you wanna cut down on the field spell and maybe Chalice and Rescue Rabbit as well. Just don’t cram too many handtraps in the deck because you need to see your starter cards as consistently as you can.</li>  	<li>Other link bosses: Avramax is a good card and all, but just passing on an Avramax doesn’t really win the game on its own. Apo is good as well, but both leave you open to Kaijus completely stopping your gameplan. You can try and make a triple co-linked Tri-Gate work, but it requires some specific links to be on board for the co-link to work. It’s still a good card though and gives an additional negate to your end boards if you manage to successfully do the co-link. The previously mentioned Borrels and Topologic monsters are also good options, but it depends on how you want to deck to work. Just be careful if you run Topologics since this deck loves summoning stuff to link arrows, which the Topologics don’t enjoy all that much. Arrival Cyberse still works as an end boss, but it takes more resources than anything else mentioned. Underworld Goddess is a good option in the deck, but it does require going second to make full use of its effect, which this deck struggles with. Other than that, there are the Knightmares as well, but I didn’t wanna include them for lore reasons.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a>: Acts as a search card that for your normal monsters that also sets up the grave. It’s an ok include, but you generally want as many normal monsters in deck as you can so Dai, Chalice, and E-Tele have as many targets as possible.</li>  	<li>Guardragons: If you trim down some of the excess World Chalice cards, you can put a Guardragon engine in the deck as well. It’s not nearly as good as it was before Elpy and Agarpain were banned, but it still gives some nice extension to the deck if you find yourself in need of it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""The Agent of Creation - Venus"">The Agent of Creation - Venus</a>: A good initial normal summon for the deck that can make way better endboards than the World Chalices can make natively. It just tends to brick me more than it helps me since all the Mystical Shine Balls clog your hand easily.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>: This deck summons an absolute ton of monsters to perform its combo, and it doesn’t really summon a negate until it reaches its endboard. Crossout is the only real Nibiru protection the deck can make use of, so it might be a good idea to include it either in addition to Called by or instead of it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talents"">Triple Tactics Talents</a>: This card is a ton of money for a reason. If you get handtrapped you can draw some more cards, Forceful Sentry your opponent, or just snag one of their monsters. All three of these effects work well in the deck so having three copies isn’t a bad idea.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart</a> / <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a>: Since this is a link deck, snagging an opponent’s monster helps a ton with extending your plays. It also forces out negates since this deck doesn’t work well through interaction.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> / <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>: Both cards are useful in shutting down negate boards when going second and Droplet even helps with graveyard setup.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>: This is the only link 1 monster that can use Lee as material turn 1 (from what I could find anyway). So, it’s useful for getting her into the grave if you brick, but it doesn’t do much other than that. At least Linkuriboh does something when it’s on board. Almiraj just kinda sits there and prays your opponent bricks as well. Still, it does have a single corner case where it can be useful, so it’s a valid option to run.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a>: Makes your turns play much differently than they otherwise would, but Girsu and Lib play super well with each other. If you run him just be mindful that you’ll have to adjust your plays around him. I also just really love running all the “final stages” of the original World Chalices in the same deck as the originals. (Auram becomes Avramax and then Avida, Ib becomes Lib and I guess Lee does too but that’s a complicated explanation, Imduk becomes Almarduke, and Ningirsu becomes Girsu)</li> </ul> I was originally planning on going through every potential combo the deck can produce, but there is just so much variation in the deck to realistically cover them all. So instead, I’ll just go over the basic steps of the combo. <ol>  	<li>Summon a normal monster (Dai, Rabbit, E-Tele, or Normal Summon)</li>  	<li>Link summon Link Spider (if you have another normal in hand), otherwise summon Imduk</li>  	<li>If you summoned Link Spider, summon a Normal from hand and link it into Imduk</li>  	<li>Tribute summon Chalice</li>  	<li>Link away Chalice and any remaining card to summon Auram</li>  	<li>Activate Chalice, then Imduk in that order to chain block</li>  	<li>Resolve the effects to gain three more material on board</li>  	<li>Make sure one monster is in a zone Auram points to and that that zone is not the center monster zone.</li>  	<li>Link the two materials Auram doesn’t point to into Ib</li>  	<li>Tribute the other material using Auram’s effect to summon Imduk from grave</li>  	<li>If Guardragon is in grave, activate its effect and summon to a zone Ib points to. Otherwise, use Lee’s effect to send Imduk to grave to summon another card from hand. And if that isn’t available either, just link everything into Apo or Avramax and pass turn.</li>  	<li>If you used Guardragon, summon Lib with the Imduk and the extra material on board to set World Legacy Succession from deck. If World Legacy Succession is already in hand, set World Legacy’s Heart instead. If you summoned Lee instead, summon Apo or Avramax here and then pass turn.</li>  	<li>Special summon Imduk to the zone Lib points to.</li>  	<li>Link away Imduk and Lib to summon Ningirsu</li>  	<li>Activate Ningirsu and Imduk in that order both to chain block and to maximize the draws</li>  	<li>Summon the monster for Imduk’s effect to the zone adjacent to Ningirsu, and then draw 3 cards. Those three cards help you play during the next turn as by now your hand is almost entirely empty.</li>  	<li>From here, you can either link away Ib and Auram into Avramax, link away Ib, Auram, and the extra monster for Apo, link away the extra monster (if it was a normal) to make Imduk and have the whole World Chalice crew there or summon Almarduke to flex on your opponent. It’s up to you really.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Hopefully that explains the basic combo the deck can do. There’s a ton of variance between hands so the combo won’t always work exactly as intended, but that’s what practice is for. Test a ton of hands and see how far you can take the deck. It may not be the next meta-contender, but it really is a fun deck to learn and play. And I hope I was able to present a good way to run the deck here.

It's better to pull Winda out on your opponent's turn if possible. We run a lot of interruption and interaction, as the biggest body we're ever getting on board is 3000 power, which is far too easy to swing over. Try to keep Monster negates and big bodies off the field.  &nbsp;  Going first, you'll want to lay down your protective traps, and try to use as few cards in hand as possible to get into Tearalaments Kitkalos. If Reino is in your hand, grab a Shaddoll if you don't already have one, otherwise grab whatever. If Reino is not in your hand, grab Reino, put him in your hand. Never summon Kaleido-Heart on your turn unless you need to pop something or you need lethal.  &nbsp;  I'm not very good at Yu Gi Oh so I have no other advice, this deck could use Barrel Rock, but sadly that's only in the OCG. You can sub in any Stone Ogre Grotto, but it's not the same."

Summoning Borreload Savage Dragon can easily be done in nearly every duel YET Borreload Savage Dragon is the main closer and often gets the most value later in the game after several link monsters have been destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deck build runs heavily artillery trap cards that can devastate an opponent otherwise dealt with such as different variants of Mirror Force and Magic Cylinder (Mirror Force Launcher, Mirror Force, Magical Cylinders, and Magic Cylinder) and main decks Anti-Spell Fragrance as a stall mechanism to how this whole Rokket/Borrel/Dragon Link Deck build works. Any spells or traps that can prevent an opponent from flooding the field or attempting to win in one turn would tremendously help this deck build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Boot Sector Launches are VERY due to how Striker Dragon is currently at 1. Boot Sector Launch will often be destroyed, running 3 is an insurance to having another one available. This build heavily relies on Boot Sector Launch to summon Rokket monsters onto the field and begin Link climbing. Boot Sector Launch at 3 is very necessary. (There are no field spell extenders included aside from Striker Dragon the reason being is that field spell extenders can become bricks once Boot Sector Launch has been activated. There are very technical plays that can be done with Rokket Tracer that can help compensate and bring resources out onto the field while Boot Sector Launch is not active).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Quick Launch are because they are not limited to once per turn and extends 3 more copies of any other Rokket in deck. One of the most versatile cards in the deck next to Rokket Tracer and Boot Sector Launch. Quick Launch synergies with most of the Rokket monster End of Phase destruction effect and there are plays that can be done with Rokket Tracer and Quick Launch. (Very important to help bring out Rokket Tracer.)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Rokket Tracers - Without a doubt one of the most technical cards in the Rokket archetype. (Rokket Tracer and Quick Launch are the best Rokket extenders in the deck to help summon out Rokket monsters from deck). There are clever plays that can be done with Rokket Tracer due to its quick effect. For example, Rokket Tracer can be used to quick effect onto any quick-play spell being used (Some clever plays involve having Rokket Tracer on the field, activating Quick Launch as chain-link1 following it up with using Rokket Tracer's quick-effect to target Quick Launch as chain-link2, targeting Quick Launch to destroy it as chain-link2, granting a Rokket Tracer speical summon off chain-link2 and a Quick Launch special summon off chain-link1). This same exact combo can be done with Rapid Trigger, Squib Draw, Bayonet Punisher, and any other Quick-Play spell as long as Rokket Tracer's chain-link is of latter of the quick-spells activation. Please keep in mind that these combos can be done on your opponent's turn as well. The real advantage to this is that these combos can be used as the final parts of a chain due to how they are all quick-play/quick-effects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rokket Tracer can also be used to destroy a Rokket monster equipped with Borrel Regenerator to trigger Rokket Tracer's special summon effect, draw 1 from Borrel Regenerator and depending on the ROkket destroyed grant another Rokket special summon during the end phase. (This clever play destroys your Rokket and sends it to the graveyard. The Rokket Monster does not get banished. Borrel Regenerator is worded cleverly and only banishes the Rokket monster attached to it if Borrel Regenerator is destroyed or removed from the field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Rokket Caliber - Helps provide variance to build Borreload Savage Dragon. Very useful when having Double Disrupter Dragon in hand and it is also very useful card to be able to be special summoned to any zone a Dark Link monster points to for resources to Link climb.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 of each other Rokket Monster - Provides variance for combos with Link monsters that can target (Mainly for Borrel Dragons and Booster Dragon. Striker Dragon as well can trigger a Rokket's quick-play destruction effect). All Rokket variance Gives Boot Sector Launch even more value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Borreload Riot Dragon - Possibly the heaviest brick in the deck but was included to provide more value out of Double Disruptor Dragon. Can be very strong if summoned early on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Absorouter Dragon, Noctovision Dragon and Outburst Dragon - All 3 of these have different extending functions YET their main purpose is to go +1 when link summoning. Both Absorouter Dragon and Noctovision Dragon are the main Rokket Synchron targets to build a quick Borreload Savage Dragon. Outburst Dragon helps further extend Rokket monster effects by destroying them when being special summoned. (This sets up resources in GY for Boot Sector Launch to have more value later in the game)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Triggering Wurm - Was put in mainly for Topologic Zeroboros. Has follow-up synergy with most of the deck when used as link material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Speedburst Dragon - A fun and useful extender that helps search 2 Rokkets when tribute summoned. Its in hand effect can also be triggered when Exploderokket's quick-play effect is triggered on field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gateway Dragon - One of the best first turn extenders to summon out a level 4 or lower Rokket monster from hand before Boot Sector Launch has been activated on the field. (Helps provide a Rokket to link summon into Striker Dragon to then search Boot Sector Launch to add to hand. Striker Dragon can then destroy itself and add the Rokket monster in graveyard back to the hand. Boot Sector Launch can then be activated to special summon the Rokekt monster that was added back to the hand to then link off into a Link-2 Dragon link monster).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hibernation Dragon - a very useful mid-game card that can help bring back a level 4 or lower Rokket monster from graveyard to hand to then special summon with Boot Sector Launch. When Hibernation Dragon is in the graveyard it serves as a Link Monster Reborn for your own link monsters by being able to be banished to special summon 1 Dark Dragon Link monster from your graveyard. (All link monsters in main deck are Dark Dragon link monsters).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Borrel Regenerator - Helps set up mini combos for Rokket Tracer or Squib Draw to trigger special summon effects and draw engine. Very useful and can also help set up resources for a link summon OR to summon Booreload Savage Dragon if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Squib Draw - Very underestimated draw engine. Synergies with most of the End Phase Rokket effects and helps provide a draw 3 with Borrel Regenerator. Very underestimated and versatile. Since it is a quick-play spell it can be used during your opponent's turn to bait spell/trap removal and easily go +1. Can also be used with a Rokket attached to Borrel Regenerator to draw 3 cards and trigger an End Phase Rokket effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bayonet Punisher -&nbsp; Very underestimated. More than often 1 Borrel link monster will either be on your field or GY (being able to banish 3 cards from your opponents graveyard). Any of the other effects on this card is a plus and can easily be met if this card is activated later on in the duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rapid Trigger - Fun card to bring out Borreload Furious Dragon early in the game. Destroys materials on field to fusion summon Borreload Furious Dragon and also protects Borreload Furious Dragon from any other special summoned monster effects from the extra deck (Rapid Trigger triggers Rokkets End Phase effects). Borreload Furious Dragon helps stun and provide synergy with Rokket monsters End Phase effects. Very underestimated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Borrel Supplier - Gets its most value when being able to summon a lower Link Borrel monster to help get Borrel Supplier's Standby special summoning effects. Get its most power when used with a Borrel Link-4 (Ideally with Borreload Dragon and Borrelguard Dragon).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror Force Launcher and Mirror Force - Synergies with Rokket/Borrel/Dragon Link Deck functions. Forces opponent to use spell/trap removal and provides Boot Sector Launch GY resources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Magical Cylinders and Magic Cylinder - Provides similar function to deck as how Mirror Force Launcher and Mirror Force do. Though Magical Cylinders effect is slightly different from Mirror Force Launcher's in that it is not a continuous trap, Magical Cylinder helps set up a trap counter to an opponent's monster's attack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anti-Spell Fragrance - Very powerful, helps delay opponent's spell cards and leaves any normal spell card vulnerable to destruction. Forcers opponent to deal with it otherwise leaves their spells vulnerable on the field. Helps delay opponent from going off on combos. If necessary or if an extra copy is in hand Anti-Spell Fragrance can also be destroyed by Rokket Tracer for a +1. Synergies with the whole Rokket deck build due to the most versatile Rokket Spell cards being Quick-Play.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Side Deck:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Red Reboot - Insurance card to seal the duel. Never set, always keep in hand and only use to end the duel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Royal Decree - Tech card vs Eldlich</p>"

As the deck has no 1 card combo, unrelated cards (handtraps, for example) have to be cut for consistency. However, almost every board can be clearer somehow. if you draw the right cards.  One thing worth noting though, as the deck combos are all 2-3 cards combos, together with Card of Demise's discard effect, you will not have any luxury to run any handtraps, so don't bother trying. If your opponent runs any FTK deck it's gg.  Tips for playing the deck: <ul>  	<li>If you want to activate The Monarchs Stormforth in opp's turn, chain it AFTER True Draco's traps, or else the effect of being able to tribute opp's monster will not apply to the traps' tribute summon.</li>  	<li>Remember to chain True Draco's searches to opp's effect, then chain The Monarchs Erupt as chain 3. This way you can search for your cards while negate opp's monster effects at the same time.</li>  	<li>Amano Iwato will stop every monster activation effect. Always summon it first.</li>  	<li>Try to tribute summon your True Draco BEFORE activating any Pot cards or Card of Demise or Dragonic Diagram. This way even if your spell is Ashed you can still at least search for a True Draco card.</li>  	<li>When you do not have a good hand and have Dragonic Diagram activated,  do not hesitate to destroy a True Draco's monster on the field for True Draco Heritage. With your 2,3 cards draw you can get Disciples of the True Dracophoenix to extend your draws and your combo further.</li> </ul>"

New T1 play goes into 4 mat Apo and Nat Beast, typically with Berserkion in hand for a T3 summon. Prefers going first but doesn't have much trouble going second, even against the current meta.

The appeal to the deck is easy to see - lots of 1 card starters that play nice with each other, lots of space for hand traps and interruptions. Very possibly the best Mechaba shell (until Branded Fusion gets here).  So, it's pretty simple - all of the Aleister cards, all of the Dogmatika cards (with a 2nd copy of Punishment), the DPE package, a pair of pots, 2 upstart, standard Ash/Maxx/Called by for Maxx ""C"" formats, standard Imperm as the first hand trap after that, and Forbidden Droplet, because the tech plays this card can make are pretty good in this deck (even though it isn't a GY deck it takes advantage of removing cards from your spell/trap zones). We also have 1 Shaddoll Schism, with 1 of each of the best Shaddoll fusions (really you're hoping to make Winda by sending Apkallone off of Nadir Servant). We also have a single VFD in the extra deck, to make using the pair of Mechabas in a grind game.  I forgot Upstart conflicts with the Pots. Fixed it now."

An actually good deck!?,"So right off the bat... Wow. I genuinely didn't thought that both archetypes would mash so well together. Now, while it may have an arguably better endboard than what i personally believe is the best variant of Libromancers (Libromancer Dogmatika) it is not <strong>as</strong> consistent, but don't let that discourage you of trying it out, it still is quite consistent.  <em><strong>What do Nephthys do to aid Libromancer?</strong></em>  First of all, libromancers love having more ritual monsters to activate their effects. Nephthys has access to ""<strong>Pre Preparation of rites</strong>"" which nets you a nice +1 and searches a ritual monster. ""<strong>preparation of rites</strong>"" searches basically everything from both archetypes.  With only one Geek Boy/Fire/First Appearance/E-Teleport you can do the entire Libromancer combo. Diviner is naturally the Normal Summon of the deck, and you can search her out with Benten who is searched out by Preparation of Rites  <strong><em>Ok, but WHAT does Nephthys do?</em></strong>  If you summon ""<strong>Conductor of Nephthys</strong>"" you can make a 4 material apollousa or any generic Link-4 of your preference, while having a destroyed ""Phoenix of Nephthys"" in the GY ready to SS in your next Stand-by Phase and pop the entire backrow (or waste one opponent's negation) all by herself.  ...  Pretty dope, right?. And you can actually do it without losing advantage since conductor is a lv 2 monster, so you can tribute the leftover geekboy of the normal Libromancer combo to start it all.  The endboard should consist of: ""<strong>Baroness of the Fleur</strong>"" + ""<strong>Libromancer Doombroker</strong>""(with intervention set) + 3200 ATK ""<strong>Apollousa, bow of the goddess</strong>"" + ""<strong>Phoenix of Nephthys</strong>"" destroyed in the GY.  Notes:  -I tried to introduce a really small Dogmatika package (2x Nadir Servant, 1x Ecclesia, 1x Fleur) but since this build relays more on the extra deck Nadir is not that great of an extender unless used last. The only target to search by sending arc light would be White Knight/Relic which would require adding Dogmatikalamity, it is a good ritual spell, but at the same time really hurts the consistency. Also i hate opening with fleur.  -At first i played 1 copy of ""Libromancer Fireburst"" thinking it would give the deck OTK potential, but seeing how easily you can summon Accesscode/Borrelsword, it is just redundant.  -No, the Phoenix of Nephthys reviving and popping backrow doesn't hurt your plays since it SS during <strong>your</strong> next Stand-by phase, and by that time, if you still have backrow it's because your opponent didn't play a thing lol. Also the field spell doesn't matter neither since you'd search another with geekboy anyway  (I'm still testing it, so the decklist may be tuned in the near future)  <strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Main deck  Out: 1x Cerulean Phoenix Of Nephthys.  In: 1x Sauravis, 3x Ash Blossom and joyous spring.  Extra Deck:  Out: 1x Draco Berserker, 1x Stardust Warrior, 1x Herald of the arc light, 1x Nephthys the sacred flame.  In: 1x Avramax, 1x Underworld Goddess, 1x Borreload Savage Dragon  Reasoning: The ED is easy to explain, basically more going second options. Also, since this deck combo plays a link-2 you have easier access to borreload, which is arguably better than berserker. Cerulean Nephthys comes up... Never, i only played it to have another target for pre-prep in case i draw 2 copies, but that also doesn't show up, and to slim the chances even more i decided to increase the size to 45 cards to filter out the bricks better, i believe the deck has enough search power to endure this."

Powerhold the moving battery is kind of a boss monster in the deck being able to be a 3400 from a trap. Your spells and traps are meant to hold your opponents down while you are always +1 off your gadgets. The main boss monsters are Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer who you can get by hard drawing fusion destiny or by playing 2 of your level 4 monsters because they are all effect monsters to play Predaplant Verte Anaconda and using its ability to activate fusion destiny straight from you deck, and Apollousa who you mainly want to use if you get out Phoenix enforcer and have extra monsters with different names to throw into her link summon, you could also play her if your get out a lot of creatures with a lucky hand to make her very big. If you are going first they how great at controlling your opponents board state. If going second you probably still want Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer if possible but you boss monsters are Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe who you can get by using the rank 4 xyz Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid, or Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder who you can get by using your Zoodiac monster and making sure to end on Zoodiac Boarbow so you can attack directly then in main 2 summon Zeus out with 6 materials. All of your xyz can gain crazy amounts of power through Xyz Territory helping your big monster become even bigger and helpful for getting Number 27 to activate its ability. Double summon and Platinum Gadget can allow you to possibly even get out 5 or more level 4 monsters on your first turn to make whatever summons you need to win."

The main combo you want to go for is 2 Toads + UDF, which you can get with any 4 bodies. Abyss Shark and Nettle lock you from doing it, but Abyss Shark increases the consistency of the deck by a lot and Nettle gives you a lot more grind, so you can't really go without them. You usually have a minimum of Toad + Kragen, which is a pretty decent board and it gives you an immense amount of followup.  I'm not playing C101/C104 or CNaphil because I think the package takes too much valuable ED space for the mediocre payoff . For this same reason, I'm also not playing Lantern Shark, as its main purpose imo is being summoned from the deck with Buzzsaw to make a rank 5.  &nbsp;  Some advice:  If you can only make 1 Xyz and you're playing blind, go for Kragen, unless you have Buzzsaw in the GY, in which case, go for Toad for the followup.  Kragen's floating is extremely strong and can help you a lot going second. Don't be afraid to purposely crash it into your opponent's monsters to get 2 quick non-targetting pops per turn or a free UDF. It can also attach Toad from the GY to get lots of advantage."

I tried other versión with Therion King Regulus and his field, in a more control based with better turns 1, but I like more this OTK version, I think I'll be switching over this two versions of the deck analizing my local's meta.  Only tried in YgoPro because with work and girlfriend, I don't have much time to spend in tournaments and stuff, but I have faith in this version, looking for someone who wants to try this deck.

Going 1st, dimensional barrier can come in clutch for those game 1 situations where you recognize the opponent's deck right away.  Siding in sanctum/scythe and DDG, you're near guaranteed to pull something to lock your opponent down before they can even play.  If you don't pull any of that, following the standard combo set of the new predaplant cards will often times get you into a board tough to beat over regardless, especially if you end on dragoon or DPE alongside dragostapelia or mirrorjade.  Going 2nd, siding in cards like raigeki and kaiju in place of D-Barrier and 3 others is ideal for breaking your opponent's board.  Typically I go with removing 1 sundew, one allure, and 1 branded opening since I'm notorious for opening an aluber or branded fusion regardless.  You can also opt to side out the allure of darkness's instead.  The DPE and Dragoon package's in the deck aren't bricks either.  Being able to use them as dark fusion targets in hand just further adds to the potential of the cards and then using cards like albion and lubellion to use them in grave gets you into dragoon or DPE that much easier."

Fuse into your many strong fusion monster whether that be through Super Poly, Branded Fusion, the newly released Branded Banishment, etc. This deck the more I play it is more about the grind game if anything and you look at the side and say ""why are you not playing the Patchwork engine in the main deck"" and my answer to that is because I find it to brick WAY TOO OFTEN now, that may all change because we have access to Branded Fusion but my point still stands  BUT I did put it in here because it is a nice game two change where my opponent may think ""oh ok so she is not playing the Patchwork Engine huh?"" then you start game two and just give them a big ol surprise when they see the engine being played. I also run the Zombie World package for Flunder matches, potentially Salamangreat if that deck sees more play because of 3 Circle and Miragestallio being a thing or just decks that rely on a specific monster type to function. You also see Eldich there and may be thinking to yourself ""why is he there?"" well the answer is very simple- we have Zombie World out; everything is a zombie now so Eldich is just a free ooga booga beatstick who can go up to 3500. The reason I run two Necroworld Banshee is for insurance in case the first one gets negated. Now, the biggest eye raiser is of course the Sales Ban inclusion and the reason for that is because it FORCES an interaction to happen to your opponent in case they want to activate a card I call with it- example: Activate Sales Ban. Call Ash Blossom. Either they use the ash or they aint using it for the turn. I do think that Crossout is also a VERY valid and option for the deck so take this as you will. I hope you enjoyed this summary of mine and I hope you like the decklist. One final note- if I had to make a choice for the deck I would either switch the Snow or Alba-Lenatus for a Necrodragon because that is the best Super Poly target under Zombie World (plz Konami reprint the card already along with Snow)."

If not stoped, Super Poly and Dragostapellia and Triphyovertum are a problem for opponent, maybe with a follow up of predaplast but only maybe if you are lucky. Your strategy is to get out Stapellia as fast as possible if you are going first, or if going second just do not ask anything, summon Chimerafflesia and banish their monsters. Don't ask, just do it."

For full combos, watch: https://youtu.be","Post may 2022 Banlist. This is an update to my Inferno Salamangreat Deck.  For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on Youtube for more info.  This Salamangreat deck incorporates Decode Talker Heatsoul. Just one tip: in case you you get Nibirued while you hold Salamangreat Circle in hand and you control a Salamangreat monster that was linked using a monster with its same name as material, you can negate the Nibiru by using Salamangreat Circle if it's the only monster you control, or at least protect that monster from being being tributed if you have multiple monsters.  https://youtu.be/AGEHsINz7m8"

When going first, you are at the risk of being Kaiju'd (or other similar effects) on your opponent's first turn, excluding your boss monster from the field, and being at the mercy of your opponent, but if playing second, your opponent can have many negate monsters and/or traps to break your combo, which would leave you in a very vulnerable state. In your starting turn, what you want to do, is generally to try to special summon both Cobalt Sparrow and Celestine Wagtail, although the latter isn't neessary if you drew Bird Sanctuary. You can do this using the effects of Bird Call, Turquoise Wabbler, Saphire Swallow, One for One, Summon Storm, Swallow's Nest, and from the GY with Beryl Canary and Turquoise Wabler. Then search for either monsters to extend your combo, or Bird Sanctuary to finish it."

Though their Main Deck monsters are primarily lackluster in power and effects, the true power of this archetype lies in the Extra Deck. The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la, respectively, can special summon the other if you control no other monsters, making them excellent starters, and the deck has a lot of ways to search them out in their archetypal Spells and Traps.  On your 1st turn, your goal is to summon E*T Ki-sikil first, special summon a Lil-la from your GY, then make E*T Lil-la, special summon E*T Ki-sikil from your GY to draw a card, you can then make either Trouble Sunny or Unchained Abomination depending on your preference or whether you go 1st or 2nd, or if you have Evil*Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, the Main Deck Boss Monster, in your hand or GY, you could make that as well.  The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la are Cyberse Type, meaning that they can be searched with Cynet Mining, their alternate cards, Frost and Treat are Aqua and Zombie, respectively, and their Extra Deck monsters and E*T Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la are Fiend Type, and most of them lock you into Fiend monsters from the Extra Deck. So thankfully, Unchained Abomination, the Boss Monster of the Unchained archetype, happens to work very well with the Live/Evil*Twins as it is also a Fiend.  For the decklist, we have a Twins package of 1x E*T Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, 3x L*T Ki-sikil, 2x L*T Ki-sikil Frost, 3x L*T Lil-la, 1x L*T Lil-la Treat, 3x L*T Sunny's Snitch, 3x Secret Password, 3x L*T Home, 1x E*T Challenge, 2x E*T Trouble Sunny, 3x E*T Ki-sikil, and 3x E*T Lil-la, for the rest of the Main Deck, we have a Handtrap lineup of 2x Nibiru, 3x Ash Blossom, 2x D.D. Crow, 2x Veiler, and 3x Infinite Impermanence, 3x Parallel eXceed, 3x Cynet Mining, 1x Avarice, and 1x Called By, for the rest of the Extra Deck, we have 1x Unchained Abomination, 1x Underworld Goddess, 1x Accescode, 1x Knightmare Unicorn, 1x Knightmare Phoenix, 1x Halqifibrax, and 1x Masquerena"

Triple Tactics Talen was a last minute inclusion that won me at least three games, definitely a good card to have.  Only 3 Ash Blossom for hand traps (besides Mercourier) was good. Using Ash to stop Fateful Adventure or Branded Fusion is great. Side deck has more matchup-specific handtraps but there's not much room for siding. Usually it makes sense to replace Ash with a more specific hand trap like token collector. Some other cards to consider when siding are the third Albaz, Albion, Mercourier, and triple tactics.

You must run 3 copies of all true draco spell and trap cards to make them consistent. The true draco monster cards can be flexed to meet your needs or the meta, but 8 tends to be enough. You can run metaverse in order to search drogonic heritage but I find it too slow for the meta. Demise and Pot of Duality are a must at 3 to ensure consistency. Pot of desire can be changed to any other card that boosts consistency, but I prefer to use pot of desires.  This is a hard going first deck. The strategy is simple, draw until you get get a floodgate and a negate, if you don't you get put in a very bad spot. Going second and not starting with a floodgate or a negate involve the same strategy. You use your true draco monsters to search for the spell to bait backrow and traps in order to bait negates or in order to disrupt the opponent.  What makes the deck powerful is the lack of a need to special summon and the powerful destruction effects of the true draco spell and trap cards in order to bait backrow or monster effects. That being said the counter to this deck is losing the coinflip, or the opponent having strong removal that does not destroy the backrow, such as their can only be one.  &nbsp;"

Why you might be asking, well I simply wanted to see how many floodgates and fun legal cards you could squeeze into a deck while still having a win condition, the win condition being leaving your locals unscathed. These are legal cards so we should be allowed to play them right? Smile.  The goal is to turbo out Utopia Double, and setup skill drain and every floodgate under the sun. Utopia Double's double effect is not an effect that can be negated by skill drain, and there for your opponent now has to deal with a 5000 ATK monster with no out, unless they draw it lol! Which is why you setup anti spell fragrance, mystic mine, d barrier and artifact sanctum by simply drawing them because drawing the 3 of cards is easy!  Waking the Dragon package is to punish them for ""drawing the out"" by forcing them to draw yet another out! Fun for the whole family! What? This isn't a monkey flip deck it takes skill!

The only way I could find to make use of Seiyaryu was to use the Hieratic monsters. Thankfully, the Hieratics actually do synergize with the Starry Knights because of Starry Knight Astel. Starry Knight Astel can tribute a Hieratic to summon Radiant Seiyaryu from the hand and also a normal dragon from the deck. Seiyaryu can be summoned from the deck to make a level 7 XYZ and Labradorite Dragon can be summoned and synchro'd with Astel for Master Flare Hyperion. The ideal turn 2 combo is:  Hand: Radiant Seiyaryu (searchable), Starry Knight Astel (searchable), Dragon of Su (or Tefnuit), Dragon of Eset (searchable), Holy Knight Sky (4x w/terraforming), Monster Reborn/Silver's Cry (4x). Normal summon Eset, tribute for Su, pop a S/T, special summon Laboradorite, overlay for Atum, detach Laboradorite, special summon REDMD, REDMD effect to special summon Eset, activate Holy Knight Sky, use effect to normal summon Starry Knight Astel, use Starry Knight Astel's effect to tribute Eset, special summon Radiant Seiyaryu from hand, pop a card, and special summon Seiyaryu from deck, overlay them into Voloferniges, link Atum and REDMD into Hieratic Seal, reborn Laboradorite, and finally Synchro Astel and Laboradorite into Masterflare Hyperion. This board packs 4 interruptions, Voloferniges' quick effect can destroy 1 face-up card, Masterflare Hyperion can banish 1 card on the field, and Hieratic Seal can tribute itself to bounce a card and then special summon Radiant Seiyaryu which can pop a card for a 4th interruption. I feel like one time I managed to pull this off with a Return of the Dragon Lords but I forgot how I did it lol.  Side deck is just some alternate options I considered."

I'm In Danger! Anti-Meta. OTK.,"Hello everyone, and welcome back to the latest installment of Gren Maju Danger Kaiju!  While I did not post a deck to for the previous format, Pot Of Desires being at 1 kinda hindered the deck, Fairy Tale Snow and a 3rd Eater Of Millions didn't quite have the same impact as 2 Desires. With it now being brought back to 2 gives the deck a reasonable chance to compete again.  The only real significant change to the main deck, as everything else is still the same as before, is the return of Super Poly. Not only is it decent VS Branded Despia, but it offers the deck a way to break through ABC Therion, as it typically ends on Masqerena and Buster making it vulnerable to Dragostapelia and also can make holes in anything using Adventurer and Baronne. Lone Twisters because I really couldn't think of anything else to put except maybe use Snow. For more in depth explanations of the rest of the deck, feel free to look through my previous builds for inspiration and insight.  The Extra deck is as before except the  addition of 4 Super Poly targets. Dragostapelia is literally immense, as non Adventurer ABC Therion is forced to lose all it's on field monster interruptions (Super Poly IP and Buster + quick eff Dragostapelia against  Regulus) and also puts work in against Branded Despia. Starving Venom works in tandem with Drago for double Dark, Mudragon typically for Gryphon and Baronne plays and Earth Golem Ignister for anything Cyberse related and also throws Shuirag/Apolussa under the bus while playing against Tri-Brigade.  Ra Sphere and D-Shifter. The two MVP 's of the side deck, that will continue to be relevant until at least Splight and Tearlaments have been power crept well into the future. These 2 cards cause literal carnage. Ra Sphere says bye bye to ABC Therion, and anything that plays Adventurer or simply spams mass monster interruptions. Also is a pretty funny psychological weapon against Floowandereze (Floow players take note!) If Floow players have Statue, Empen + Dreaming Town, simply declare you want to go into the battle phase while holding Ra Sphere. You pretty much force the Dreaming Town and the Floow player to summon Apex to combat the implied threat of Evenly Matched. Because the game state has changed, you can now choose not to go into Battle Phase and simply Ra Sphere over the 3 monsters.  D-Shifter is the opposite of Ra Sphere.  Rather than allowing your opponents to commit resources, you can just stop them wanting to commit resources. 2 Twisters , 1 Super poly and Reboot for further board breaking and OTK potential. D barrier swaps places with DD Ground, because while DD ground is solid, the meta is pretty Branded and Swordsoul heavy, and DD ground doesn't entirely stop either from playing (Branded have Lubelion to shuffle fusion material back into the deck,  and certain monsters of theirs benefit from the banish and normal Swordsoul plays that don't involve Tenyi are pretty much unaffected as you run no handtraps other than Shifter).

In general, the goal is to just get at least 1 Telefon in the grave, and 1 in attack with its effect ready to activate. From there, you can use the attack position Telefon's effect to summon the Telefon in the grave. This will let you link off the Telefon whose effect you just used before you can use the new Telefon's effect to resummon the linked-off Telefon. Repeat the chain until you either assemble whatever end board seems appropriate for the situation, or you run out of links."

I have spent about 3-4 years playing this deck. After all this time what you are seeing in front of you is the best I was able to come up with. I proudly present to you ""COMBO GEARGIA""!!! To play Geargia you basicaly have two options. The first one is to play many floodgates and traps while sitting on one 'Gear Gigant X' and waiting for your opponent to lose interest. The second one is to try and summon monsters like 'Megaclops' , 'Zeus' or 'Utopic Future'.  Since we are obviously focusing on the latter here are some of the hands you may be looking for going first, and also what they end on.  Geargiauger + Machine Duplication: NS Auger - add Accelerator - acc Dup, targeting the Auger - SS the Accelerator - SS Gigant X - acc Gigant, detaching Accelerator, add another Accelerator    *repeat a few times until you have 3 Gigant X*  link all three away into Megaclops and hope that your opponent didn't draw an out.  Geargiaauger + Machine Duplication + Infinitrack Anchor/Accelerator:  If you happen to open with an additional Accelerator all you have to do is replicate the strategie above now just beeing able to summon an extra Number 27 which can be considered a mini tank with high hopes for its future. Anchor Drill on the other hand can give you the option of either going into the Megaclops line again or to summon Utopic Future + Number 27. You do that by summoning Auger via Drill then SS Accelerator and prociding to acctivate Machine dup, in this line you do not use the effect of Auger and by that are not ristricted to only summoning machines.  A way to summon two monsters without using Auger + Geargiagear/eXceed: Link the two monsters away into I:P and set Geargiagear. On your opponents turn you summon Apollousa. OR Link into I:P summon two eXceeds link those into Virus Swordsman and summon, now or later, Avramax!  Going second its all the same exept that you can now use Schedule + any earth machine to summon out Avramax, due to it being summond with I:P it cannot be destroyed by card effects!  So yeah thats about it. A way to improve the deck is probably to look into some of the rank 8 and 9 plays Anchor Drill provides but I'm not going to be the one to do that. Hopefully this can be considered usefull and I have been able to demonstrate that there are other ways to play geargia than just set 5 pass.  :)"

For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on Youtube for more info.  In the gameplay, I opted not to use the Field Spell's effect (Once per turn: You can target 1 Set card in your opponent's Spell &amp; Trap Zone; while this card is in the Field Zone, that Set card cannot be activated until the End Phase, and your opponent must activate it during the End Phase or else send it to the GY) because I wanted to do more plays.

I was heavily considering cutting D - Force and E - Emergency Call, and siding Dimensional Barrier and Evenly Matched. I'm also interested in maybe adding or siding Destiny HERO - Dark Angel. I've been duped into buying the Secret Rare, so may as well try it.  If you have any suggestions for what I should add or cut please feel free to message me on Discord @ Tzisae#6054."

If you have a few Mysterune Quick-play Spell card, those non-Mysterune must be strong. You can build a deck with those properties with 40 card quite easily, and there are a lot of Mysterune Decks like this have been top in some Tournament. But how to build a 60 card Mysterune Deck? To ensure the property 1, you must play all Mysterune Spell card at 3 except the Countinous Spell card, because it is a dead card. But still, you just have 1/3 Mysterune Quick-play Spell in your Main Deck, so the deck must have card/archetypes/engine that can Draw/Mill or Disrupt/Control strongly. -Among non-Mysterune card, Pot of Desire and Grass is the must have card, and Triple Tactic Talent/Metalfoes Fusion are good Draw card that you should play 1. Another very strong Draw/Mill cards are Maxx ""C"" (which also Disrupt card) and Reasoning/Monster Gate, but sadly, those card can't be play together because you don't want to have a lot Monster in your deck for Reasoning/Monster Gate, and Maxx ""C"" whatever how many you play in this Deck is very arkward. So either 3 Maxx ""C"" or 3 Reasoning+3 Monster Gate, not both. You must choose between strong going second or going first ability. -Among non-Mysterune archetypes, Tearalaments is the best choice. This archetypes is very strong, it works very well with Grass, it can Mill sometimes and it can Disrupt/Control with just 1 Rainoheart or 1 Tearalaments+some lucky, and the best thing this archetypes can do is El Shaddoll Winda, which one of the best Floodgate in Meta game. -And is there any good engine for this deck? Luckily, Konami have realeased ""the Ancient"" archetypes, which can mill 5 CARD with Kelbek/Agido!!! So you can play this deck without Reasoning/Monster Gate by replace them with the engine Kelbek/Agido so you can play 3 Maxx ""C"" while still have strong going first ability!!! And you can play more Tearalaments monster, like Haufenis, so you have 9 hand trap Maxx ""C""/Haufenis/Kelbek for going second!!! And after add some good card, you now have a good Mysterune Deck as show here. It still weak to hand trap or going second (sadly) but if you lucky, it is very fun to play."

A similar deck is not to be found on this side, so I decided to share it here.  In an effort to not copy the deck 1 to 1, I made some minor changes to MBT's decklist.  &nbsp;  The idea behind the deck is to use the Branded engine as tribute fodder for the Monarchs.  Your combos are very hand dependent.  &nbsp;  The side deck presents some options to play with the ratios in the deck, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!  &lt;&lt; Edit:  I removed the Shaddoll package and included the Dogmatika cards. Escalation is the backup way to tribute summon during the opponents turn. &gt;&gt;"

Most expensive cards are Pot of Extravagance and Foolish Burial Goods but they make the deck more consistent. Can add more handtraps, I just included Effect Veilers since they are only 1 dollar each and generally useful against most decks. Pretty much just an outline for the deck. I excluded extra deck since it doesn't matter what's in it, just make sure that there are 15 cards if you want to resolve your Pot all 3 times. Side deck is whatever, make sure you have some sort of spell removal."

I've already made a definitive guide on how to use Megalith that I consider a deck that needs a lot of training to know how to use but that is not among the most difficult decks in the game at the DDD level: https://ygoprodeck.com/megalith-master-duel -apr22-format/  The main change I made to what I used before is to <strong>cut </strong><a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a><strong> to 1 copy in the deck</strong> because it is a necessary card for combos to work but the second copy is not that relevant compared to the second copy of <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> or of <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, so by decreasing the number of Megalith Ophiel in the deck I was able to put <strong>more tech cards</strong> improving the deck's blind second against meta decks.  The deck has good qualities to be used: - <strong>Consistency</strong>: despite the <strong>high number of hand traps</strong> (11 slots) you have a lot of <strong>combination of 2 card combos</strong> so you can build a Ritual Summon deck that manages to have a balance between engine and tech cards. - The deck <strong>engine is cyclical and manages to generate an advantage every turn</strong>, whether yours or the opponent's turn, which makes the game volume very high and oppressive for the opponent because you are always proposing new moves with each passing turn. No wonder it's common for you to end turn 3 of the game with between 12 and 14 cards in the deck so absurd is the <strong>Megalith's search power</strong>. - The surprise factor also helps a lot because there are starting hands that you open that in themselves are <strong>resilient to 1 Hand Trap/interaction</strong> and depending on the opponent's ignorance about your moves you can combo up 2 Hand Traps and I even managed to make my 1 turn setup up to 3 Hand Traps. - The <strong>end board you make is very good against any match up you face</strong>, whether it's combo decks, control decks, that have several layers of play or that just set 5 traps and pass the turn so it's very difficult for you to lose to random decks and meta decks most of the time will have to open with a very <strong>strong combination of cards</strong> to go over their field and I practically never took OTK when making my turn 1 setup so <strong>resilient is it to Blind Second Cards</strong> like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> etc.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////// Now I'm going to talk about some cards that most positively surprised me in the use of the deck:  <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och:</a> when using the card in the deck I didn't regret testing it because it really makes the <strong>Megalith engine plays better whether to build field or break</strong>, mainly because it's a <strong>fourth name of low level Megalith Monster</strong> to use the effect of Ritual Summon on your turn allowing you to build moves that aren't possible if you don't use it. And on the opponent's turn it works almost like <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> being able to Ritual Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> to the field, but you'll have to have it in hand first and that's good if your <strong>Megalith Phul eff from Ritual Summon doesn't resolve</strong> because your opponent used <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> or <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> type of card to negate it.  <a data-name=""Cyber ​​Angel Benten"">Cyber ​​Angel Benten</a> and <a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a>: These cards greatly increase your grind game because it's <strong>very simple to loop Benten for Ritual Summon</strong> and add Manju to your hand every turn which allows you to access <strong>XYZ's Toolbox Rank-4</strong> easily to control the game.  <strong>Impcantation Engine</strong>: It's a fantastic engine to <strong>deal with opponent interactions</strong> because you can Ritual Summon saving cards and leaving the rest in your hand as push moves, so for example I've managed to deal with Virtual World <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> which is a <a data-name=""Macro Cosmo"">Macro Cosmo</a>s field without having any of my Ritual monsters banished because I just used <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> and Impcantation monsters to Ritual Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> who brought <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> from the deck for example and as I had done NS <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> on the turn I was able to RANK-4 <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> to shuffle the Shenshen back to the deck and play cool afterwards. So it's an engine that is not only good against interactions, but also <strong>helps to play around cards that are out of your control like some Floodgates</strong>.  <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a>: This card plays more than one role in the deck because in addition to saying <strong>""No"" to field-breaking cards</strong> like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> it <strong>adds two follow ups to the hand</strong> so it's a card that always leaves you on par with your opponent in card advantage and since you can <strong>always loop Benten back to your hand</strong> in this deck your opponent is short on time to take it out as you will always have the negate spell/trap live effect again to use.  <strong>Extra Deck Monsters</strong>: Among the XYZ monsters, the ones that surprised me the most were <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> which is basically a <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> for face-up cards on the field, which is important to avoid card effects like <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</a></span> or <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a></span> that don't activate its effects if gets back to the Extra Deck.  Another card that was very useful was <a data-name=""Number 101: Silent Honor ARK"">Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</a> because <strong>LINK monsters can't play around</strong> its effect and after stealing the opponent's LINK monsters you go to the battle phase and <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> in Main Phase 2 to deal with even more opponent's cards. Simply <strong>Number 101 and AA-Zeus can take a lot of boring card out of the field</strong> like <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></span> because even taking 3k damage with Silent Honor ARK you do AA-Zeus on M2 and take it out of the field.  And finally we have the <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a> that has the utility of being made on top of <a data-name=""Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk"">Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk</a>, <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a> that are out of material and give <strong>piercing damage</strong> to the opponent or simply make it difficult to take it off from the field because if not <strong>you reborn any Level5 or lower monster from GY</strong> like a Megalith Phul for example.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// ////"

Oh and also it's a control deck I guess. ,"So, the idea behind this deck is simple - I've always liked the idea of a Cyberse deck, because there is a lot of really good generic cyberse link support, but the pieces aren't all the way there yet - there's an absence of good things to end on going first (yes, Tri-Gate exists, but it takes a lot of resources to turn on and doesn't have many partners). Also, while going second has sweet OTK potential, there isn't really a ""generic"" 1-card engine that puts up Update-Transcode-Accesscode - however, you can do that with the salad engine. It's pretty brilliant all things around - you get to run Micro-Coder and Cynet Conflict, letting you stack up even more Omnis going first while having more tools to jam out Accesscode. You have good Salad grind game to fall back on, looping Ashes, looping the traps, basically if you get ground into a halt trying to kill or combo you most likely have some interruption still. Suddenly, going first your common end board is Transcode protecting self-linked Sunlight Wolf with backrow galore, whereas meanwhile you're tuned to very often just kill outright with Accesscode on a turn you have a battle phase. Add in a couple Pot of Avarice for a little greed and a hell of a lot of extra grind, and suddenly you're the deck that can do anything... almost.  The truth is, the end board is very weak to sweepers, and going second is always a huge risk if you don't see Droplets. I don't see this as a tier 1 or even 2 threat, even if it is respectable and will just suddenly kill out of nowhere. I also don't think this is the best version of Salad if you want to play Salad - this is a link deck that OTKs with Accesscode first, and Salad plays are just to get you there.  I've also included I:P into Crusadia Avramax because 1) it is funny, 2) it's kinda lowkey good in the Master Duel meta rn, and BO1 makes it more viable, and 3) it actually synergizes with the Salad engine and gives you something to actually work towards when you can just extend for days."

Although the End Board is often not cool for your opponent to face, what I find interesting are mainly the use of <strong>several generic engines that have some synergy with the Fluffal deck</strong> such as <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> and <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> and especially <strong>Destiny HERO package</strong> to make <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> and I'm using <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> to have more ways to Fusion Summon. I made these other deck profiles that explain how the deck works and are very useful for playing Fluffal correctly because this is not a linear deck and each starting hand changes the way you build plays: https://ygoprodeck.com/fluffal-fusion-format-may22/ https://ygoprodeck.com/fluffal-may22-format/  ////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combo details</strong>:  - During your combo, think about <strong>which peaces you need right now and which ones you can leave and add later</strong>. So many times you will use <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> to send <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and add the <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> that will set you to <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> from the deck which is a very good move <strong>depending on your cards</strong> in hand especially if you have <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>, <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> or some other good discard for the GY like <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>. <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">- Bahamut Shark</a> you will always use as a material link so if you made it without having Link Monsters before you put it in the Extra Monster Zone so you don't create conflicts when you special summon the field.  - It's common for you to take hand traps/interactions or <strong>when you can't access</strong> <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> at all you do <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> just to <strong>force the opponent not to destroy it</strong> because if you don't you <strong>add Scythe to the hand</strong> and Fusion Summon on his turn.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Details about the engines used</strong>:  <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> sends Spells/Traps as a cost to GY so if you have 2 <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> on the field it doesn't matter if the opponent denies DRAW 2 because you will still have <strong>2 Toy Vendor search</strong> which will most likely be <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a>. The only detail of this engine is that you only use the <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> effect when you <strong>have already done the searches</strong> and now you will activate Toy Vendor eff of draw so that the <strong>top of the deck does not change</strong>.  <a data-name=""Destiny Hero - Dangerous"">Destiny Hero - Dangerous</a> package with <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a> = RANK-6 <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> to send <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> <strong>without wasting your Normal Summon</strong> and has easy Link Climb to make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> move for example. You do this combo by opening only <strong>one of the HERO ""Bricks"" and Frightfur Patchwork</strong>. This engine can also be useful for you to <strong>send</strong> <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> <strong>to the GY if you haven't had access to the card yet</strong> and <strong>add it back to the hand</strong> with <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Fluffal Octopus</a>. It also helps you to play after taking <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> when solving the <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> effect because you do <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> and basically you <strong>have 3 more Special Summons</strong> for the field which allows you to Link Climb to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> or even make the <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> that allows you to Fusion Summon your Frightfur monsters to give OTK if you bring the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> for example.  <a data-name=""Proxy F Magician"">Proxy F Magician</a> = Fusion Summon plays, he's not as bad in this deck as at first although you <strong>need to have the Fusion Materials on the field</strong> because you have cards like <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> that make it <strong>easy for you to setup for Fusion Summon</strong>. And it's Fire attribute which gives you another pop for Accesscode Talker.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Examples of Test Hands</strong>: Here I've copied some moves I've made with the deck by playing matches in the Dueling Book so you can get an idea of ​​how to make the deck engine spin and build boards. So it's basically me repeating the same steps I did in the match and even demonstrating the gamestate of the opponent's field in one of the replays so that the move makes sense.  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-39587859 Example 1 versus PUNK Therion  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-39589406 Example 2 versus Despia Predaplant  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-39590690 Example 3 - Two examples of Full Combo from the deck I made, in one of them I played Beatrice send Scythe to GY to add to the hand. And you can see the luck factor present in the random draws of the deck because it's not always guaranteed to pass with the interaction of Scythe + Penguin on the opponent's turn if your draws are redundant.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////  A very <strong>important Ruling</strong> with <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> is about the <strong>atk boost</strong> because if you <strong>successfully resolve the Boost effect and then the opponent negates the effects</strong> of the Fusion monster you targeted and increased ATK that monster will <strong>continue with the Boost ATK</strong> until end of turn. So a common situation in which this happens is you use the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> trigger effect when Fusion Summoned and the opponent tries to negate it with <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> for example and in <strong>chain link 3 you use Cruel Whale to increase its ATK to 3900</strong> and when the chain link resolves the Cruel Whale will be with the effects negated but will continue with the ATK Boost. So call a judge if your opponent thinks the ATK goes back to the original of the Fusion monster because I know this ruling ATK modifiers and that's the difference in many cases between losing and winning.  ////////////////////////////////////////////////"

The strategy now has 2 new monster extenders, Springirl and Sleepy Maiden, an incredible spell card, Marincess Dive, and two fantastic new link monsters, Aqua Argonaut and Coral Triangle. Along with an engine that provides near-endless amounts of recyclability and follow-up, Marincess is ready to grind out the best in the format, positioning itself as one of the strongest control decks in the game!</span>  <b>Main Deck- 41 cards</b>  <span>Marincess Engine (Monsters)</span>  <b>3x Marincess Blue Tang-</b><span> Blue Tang is your most consistent starter. On Normal or Special Summon, she can send one Marincess monster from your deck to your graveyard. When she's sent to the Graveyard as material for a Water Link Monster, she can excavate the top 3 cards of the deck and, if there are any Marincess cards among those 3, she can add 1 to your hand, like a Normal Summoned Salamangreat Foxy. This 2nd effect is great for chain-blocking your Link-1 effects, and because the deck now plays more Marincess cards than ever before (19 in this build), your chances of adding a card off this excavation are about 80% or more if this is your starting play.</span>  <b>3x Marincess Sea Horse- </b><span>Sea Horse occupies a unique place in the deck. On first release of the archetype, Sea Horse was the strategy's best Normal Summon and extender. Now, she's essentially the jack-of-all-trades of the deck, good for just about any occasion. She has no effect on summon (Adventurer Marincess is another possible build!), but can special summon herself to the zone a Marincess Link Monster points to without starting a chain. Additionally, in the Graveyard, she can special summon ANY Water monster from your hand to a Marincess Link Monster's arrow, but not on the turn she was sent. If she was a level 4, she'd be perfect but she's still an easy 3-of for her versatility.</span>  <b>3x Marincess Springirl- </b><span>Marincess has a new level 4 extender! Springirl allows you to banish 1 Marincess monster from your graveyard and special summon herself. Previously, if your opponent managed to get rid of your Normal Summon with something like Swordsoul Blackout, the deck crumbled rather easily. But, thanks to cards like Springirl and Dive, this is less of a problem now! Additionally, when she's sent to the Graveyard as Link material, she can send cards from your Deck to the GY equal to the number of Marincess monsters you control, and inflict 200 damage for each Marincess card sent.</span>  <span>This effect might seem rather innocuous but it serves 3 important purposes. First, this effect can chainblock, extremely useful for preventing an Ash on your Sea Angel search. Second, the mill can help win in time in some cheeky scenarios. And third, (yes, this structure is a Vrains reference), not only can you mill cards that provide extension/be added back to hand with cards like Blue Slug, Coral Anemone, Marbled Rock, and Toadally Awesome but in the Adventurer or Swordsoul matches, milling a Token Collector for free can be a huge momentum swing.</span>  <b>2x Marincess Pascalus- </b><span>I wasn't even playing Pascalus for a while, but I've seen the light. Pascalus can be hit-and-miss, but if you're playing Bahamut Shark and Toad, she is a must. On Normal OR Special Summon, Pascalus can Special Summon a Marincess monster from your hand, other than herself. This effect is near-useless if she's the only Marincess in your hand (especially if you open both copies of her), but if she isn't, she can be very powerful.</span>  <span>In a good hand, Pascalus can get Bahamut Shark into Toadally Awesome by your 4th summon, before you even go into your full Marincess combo, or slap down an early Crystal Heart. She also has a neat Graveyard effect where, other than the turn she was sent to the Graveyard, she can banish herself to add a Marincess spell/trap back to your hand. This means you can add back a Dive, a Battle Ocean, a Wave, whatever you may need. You really don't want to see two in- hand, hence not maxing out on her, and Blue Tang is your best 1-card starter, but Pascalus adds that extra layer of pressure that can mean everything in both the opener and the grind.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Sleepy Maiden- </b><span>Sleepy Maiden is the strangest Main Deck Marincess to-date, but neatly fills a spot in the deck others can't. She's a level 5, which can be frustrating (you can’t use her for Sea Angel or Blue Slug), but she is a very unique special summon. Sleepy Maiden targets a Marincess card on the field, special summons herself, and, as long as she's on the field, that card cannot be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. This is great for protecting your Battle Ocean from cards from spell removals like Lightning Storm and Twin Twisters and also popular bosses like Baronne de Fleur and Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. She can be an excellent simple extender, but if she's included on your endboard, the deck has another level of difficulty to crack.  Additionally, in the Graveyard, she can banish herself to equip a Marincess Link Monster in the GY to another Marincess Link Monster on the field. This makes Sleepy Maiden a go-to send for Blue Tang, for times when Sea Angel gets negated or for Wonder Heart to put an extra body on the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>1x Marincess Mandarin- </b><span>Mandarin is likely the worst Marincess monster, but she deserves her spot in the deck. Mandarin can special summon herself to the zone a Water Link Monster points to if there are 2 or more Marincess monsters on the field, but she is banished when she leaves the field. Notably, this effect works in either the Graveyard or the hand, so she can be a great send off of Forbidden Droplet, Cynet Mining, Coral Triangle, or Great Bubble Reef, and can even help boost Bubble Reef's attack in a pinch. And, as she can be used for either of the Link-1s, she's still a one-card combo thanks to Marincess Dive.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x Silent Sea Nettle- </b><span>The only non-handtrap, non-Marincess monster in the Main Deck! Silent Sea Nettle is a level 4 extender that can special summon itself from the hand, as long as you control another Water monster, but it locks you into only summoning Water monsters for the rest of the turn... </span><span>Yeah, I think we can live with that.</span>  <span>This card is straight-up perfect. Excellent for an early Bahamut into Toad, an easy way to continue a turn, and, while it's in the Graveyard, you can banish it to shuffle 3 Water monsters from the Graveyard back into your deck (this can also include another copy of the card, and can be used the same turn it special summoned itself!). Running low on Extra Deck resources? Silent Sea Nettle can fix that, easily. Even sending/milling the card isn't a loss by any means. Just an outstanding card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Marincess Engine (Spells + Traps)</span>  <b>3x Cynet Mining- </b><span>A neg-1 but a strong way to boost consistency, and if you send a Marincess card off of Cynet, it is more than likely the card will find itself back in your hand shortly. However, watch out for Droll and Lock bird in games 2 and 3. Droll isn't a silver bullet against the deck like it would be against something like Dragon Link or Drytron, but it can still hurt, especially if your first search is off of Cynet Mining.</span>  <b>3x Marincess Dive- </b><span>Oh my God, is this card amazing! Marincess Dive is Monster Reborn for any non-Link Marincess monster but, if you have Marincess Battle Ocean up on the field, Dive can summon from deck. You want to open this card as much as possible. And remember that 3 different Marincess monsters can add this card back to your hand from the graveyard, so it will continually wind up back in your hand. As a note, the effects are bulleted, allowing the player to choose which effect they'd like to activate if Battle Ocean is on the field, playing around certain handtraps that may ruin your day otherwise.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Battle Ocean- </b><span>The heart and soul of the deck, Battle Ocean is a fascinating and unique Field Spell. When it is face-up on the field, monsters in the Extra Monster Zone that were Link Summoned using Marincess Crystal Heart are unaffected by your opponent’s card effects, and all Marincess monsters gain 200 attack base plus 600 attack for every Marincess monster they're equipped with. How do Marincess monsters become equipped?</span>  <span>Well, when a Marincess is Link-Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone, Battle Ocean can equip up to 3 differently-named Marincess monsters from your Graveyard to the newly-summoned monster. This is amazing for giving your Marincess monsters some extra attack, and also provides some very interesting interactions with cards like Forbidden Droplet, which is getting a reprint in Duels from the Deep as well! Most funny scenario? A 3500 attack Marincess Blue Slug crashing into an Eldlich under Skill Drain.</span>  <b>2x Marincess Wave-</b><span> Wave is a recursive, searchable monster negate that turns all face-up monsters on your side of the field into Towers (unaffected by opponent’s card effects). This card can even be activated from the hand if you control a Link-3 or higher Marincess monster! This is another key feature of your Marincess endboard, and being able to essentially put an Infinite Impermanence back in your hand every turn can make life quite difficult for your opponent. Because the card can be added by Coral Triangle, added back to the hand by Anemone, Marbled Rock, or Pascalus, isn’t a once per turn, and isn’t great going 2nd, 2 copies is the best ratio.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span><b>Utility (Handtraps + Going 2nd cards)</b></span><b> </b><b> </b><b>3x Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring- </b><span>Too much use to not play at 3 in a mid-range deck!</span>  <b>3x Effect Veiler- </b><span>Not as good as Infinite Impermanence but still hits a vast majority of decks, and while drawing Imperm off of Great Bubble Reef on the opponent’s turn is a dead card, Veiler is live from the get-go.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>3x Infinite Impermanence- </b><span>The better Veiler, good in just about every matchup.</span>  <b>2x D.D. Crow- </b><span>Crow isn’t a once per turn, and is impactful against almost every meta deck save Floowandereze (it can still stop Stri but that’s about it).</span>  <b>1x Cosmic Cyclone- </b><span>It’s an out to Mystic Mine, but also, banishing a Swordsoul Blackout before it can pop 2 of your cards, forcing an early Branded in Red, banishing a Discolosseum or Sunavalon Bloom, it certainly comes up.</span>  <b>1x Called By The Grave- </b><span>Can we just ban this sacky-ass card already?</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>3x Forbidden Droplet- </b><span>Marincess struggles with going 2nd into an established board. It can play through multiple disruptions, but being able to set up while breaking is difficult. Droplet is a massive boon to the deck for both your going first and second plays. Marincess cards sent to the Graveyard off of Droplet won’t stay there long.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Additionally, Battle Ocean’s effect to equip Link Monsters isn’t a once per turn, so you can use Droplet while link climbing going 2nd. Additionally, sending a Coral Anemone off of Droplet in the S/T zone will put a Marincess card back in the hand, so you can even gain free resources/follow-up off of negating your opponent’s monsters!</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><b>Extra Deck</b><b> </b><b> </b><span>The Marincess Links</span>  <b>2x Marincess Blue Slug- </b><span>Blue Slug is a very simple Link-1 that adds back a Marincess monster from the Graveyard on Link Summon. It can only be summoned once per turn, but you’ll want two of these in the grind game. Remember, as soon as you use this effect, you’re locked into Water monsters. Some builds may care about that, but this one doesn’t at all.</span>  <b>2x Marincess Sea Angel- </b><span>On Link Summon, Sea Angel adds a Marincess spell to hand. Previously, the only spell was Battle Ocean but now, Sea Angel can add Dive, which makes her so much more powerful! It is very likely that your opponent will attempt to negate Sea Angel, so if you have a way to chain-block her search, it is wise to use cards like Blue Tang and Springirl as material. Playing 4 Link-1 monsters is excellent for the grind game and resource management.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Crystal Heart- </b><span>Crystal Heart is the only card in the extra deck that isn’t necessarily a piece of disruption or advantage generation, but it is entirely unique. She’s unaffected by monster effects while in the Extra Monster Zone, which is very funny if your opponent uses Nibiru while she is the only monster on the field (she is often the 5th summon), and has a niche battle protection effect for herself and other Marincess monsters that has come up precisely 1 time in dozens of hours of playtesting.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Crystal Heart is in the Extra because, with Battle Ocean up, any Link-Summoned monster in the EMZ that uses her as material is unaffected by your opponent’s effects. This means no Nibiru, no Super Poly, no effect destruction, no banishing, any of these monsters can only be tributed or destroyed by battle under this protection. Very interesting card.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>2x Marincess Coral Anemone- </b><span>Coral Anemone is a 2000 attack Link-2 that can special summon any Water monster with 1500 or less attack from your Graveyard to a zone she points to, without negating their effects. This is very powerful, but it does target </span><b>and</b><span> does have to summon to her link zone, so Imperm, Crow, Veiler, Gamma, and Ghost Ogre can all interact with her. If your hand has a good starter and extender, make Anemone using Crystal Heart and prevent your opponent from being able to interact with her.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>When sent from the field to the Graveyard, Anemone can add </span><b>any </b><span>Marincess card from the Graveyard to the hand. She does not have to be sent by card effect or anything, so even sending her as a cost for Droplet triggers this effect. This is normally the card you’ll most want equipped to your Marincess Link Monsters.</span>  <b>1x Marincess Marbled Rock- </b><span>The original Marincess boss monster still has a place in the deck! Once per turn, Marbled Rock can add 1 Marincess card back to your hand from the Graveyard, similar to how Coral Anemone works when she’s linked off. In battle, she has a non-once per turn ability to send a Marincess monster from hand to the Graveyard to prevent damage/battle destruction when she or another one of your monsters is attacked. Mostly, she’s used for link-climbing in later turns to recur resources, and having a 2500 body on a Link-3 is nothing to sneeze at, especially when she reaches 4500 under Battle Ocean with 3 equips.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Coral Triangle- </b><span>The new Link-3! Coral Triangle can send 1 Water monster from your hand to the Graveyard to add a Marincess trap, which is just Wave for our purposes. Any level 4 or lower Marincess monster can get to Coral Triangle + Wave, which makes this very easy to accomplish even without a strong starter or extenders. Searching Wave is amazing for the deck, as it no longer has to focus so much on drawing into the card for turn or off of Bubble Reef.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Her Graveyard effect can provide immense crackback if your opponent isn’t prepared. If only your opponent controls a monster, you can banish Triangle from the Graveyard and special summon any number of Water Link Monsters from the Graveyard whose total Link Ratings equal 3. This is usually Anemone + Angel/Slug, but can also include Marbled Rock, Crystal Heart, Eria, and so forth. The effects of these monsters are also not negated. So essentially, if you make Triangle as part of your turn 1 combo, your next turn is already set to go, even if there aren’t any cards in your hand. Coral Triangle is a huge boost for the deck!</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Aqua Argonaut- </b><span>Marincess’ new Link-4 is also likely their best to date. On your turn, Argonaut can bounce 1 Water monster you control and 1 card your opponent controls back to hand. On your opponent’s turn, she can negate the activated effect of a Spell/Trap by special summoning a Marincess Link Monster she’s equipped with (watch for Ogre!), and while she’s in the Extra Monster Zone, your opponent can only attack her. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Normally, she is unaffected and at somewhere between 3700-4900, depending on your equips, so destroying her in battle is easier said than done. This is also great if an opponent attempts to destroy Toadally Awesome in battle before you’d like to use their effect to negate, or to out Sleepy Maiden to go after your field spell. In my opinion, the deck’s best endboard for power and follow-up is an unaffected Argonaut in the EMZ equipped with Anemone + 2 others, Sleepy Maiden in defense (summoned by targeting Battle Ocean), Toadally Awesome, Coral Triangle in the Graveyard, and 3 cards in-hand, including Wave. This board is not only difficult to crack, with multiple pieces of interaction, but also provides 3 possible follow-ups from Triangle, Toad, and Anemone.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Great Bubble Reef- </b><span>Great Bubble Reef is another eccentric, 3-effect Link-4 in your arsenal! Each time a monster is banished face-up, Bubble Reef gains 600 attack for the duration of that turn (this card is hilarious against Fairy Tail Snow), and during the Standby Phase, she can banish 1 Water monster from your Graveyard or face-up field to draw 1 card.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>By sending a Water monster from your hand to the Graveyard, Great Bubble Reef can special summon back any of your banished Marincess monsters, including Link Monsters, without negating their effects. And, once again, if she is outed and in the graveyard, you have 5 different monsters that can put her back in the Extra deck!</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Marincess Wonder Heart- </b><span>Wonder Heart is mostly used to push for damage. Some people play Accesscode/Transcode instead of, say Eria and Wonder Heart, but I enjoy not having to worry about the Water lock, and Wonder Heart has tricks that Accesscode simply doesn't. When she battles an opponent’s monster, she can special summon a Marincess monster she’s equipped with, and protects herself from damage/battle destruction. If she is destroyed on the field by your opponent, she can special summon a Link-3 or lower Marincess from your Graveyard.</span>  <span>Wonder Heart can help close out games, or get in some quick damage in a pinch. I really like doing a combo in the late game, if I’m not at lethal, where I’ll make Marbled Rock, add back a Marincess card, summon Wonder Heart, equip Wonder Heart with Marbled Rock, attack with Wonder, summon Marbled, attack with Marbled, and then go into one of the other Link-4s in Main Phase 2. It’s a little dance of link juggling that I find super fun!</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>The Marincess Extra Deck Supporting Cast</span>  <b>1x Eria The Water Charmer, Gentle- </b><span>Eria is likely summoned the least out of every monster in this Extra Deck but, for her particular niche, she is extremely useful. Eria can get an annoying Contact “C”, Nibiru, or Knightmare Corruptor Iblee off of your board, as she just takes 2 monsters including a Water, but on destruction, she can also add any of your Water monsters to your hand, save Pascalus and Sleepy Maiden.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Additionally, though her effect to special summon a Water monster from your opponent’s Graveyard will come up only on occasion, I have been able to take cards such as Swordsoul of Mo Ye and Tenyi Spirit Shthana to make Bahamut Shark, though in theory, you could also take cards such as Sky Striker Ace Shizuku, Plunder Patroll cards, and even Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign Chengying.</span><span> </span><span> </span><b>1x Bahamut Shark- </b><span>This card just reads “Slap together 2 level 4 Water monsters, detach 1 material, and summon one of the best negations in the game.”</span>  <b>1x Toadally Awesome- </b><span>As many people already know, Toadally Awesome is entirely befitting of their name. Their effects are:</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1. Standby Phase: Detach 1 material, special summon 1 Frog from the deck (is not used in this deck)</span><span> </span><span>2. When your opponent activates an effect (Monster, Spell/Trap), you can send 1 Aqua monster from your hand/field (including itself!) to the GY to negate that effect, destroy the card, and set the negated card to your field. </span><span>3. If this card is sent to the GY (in any way), you can target 1 Water monster in your Graveyard (including itself, again!) and add it back to your hand.</span>  Toad is just incredible. The negation is excellent, the set card can have a variety of uses, and the ability to recur itself or any of your Marincess monsters makes the deck even more difficult to fully take down.  <span><b>Side Deck</b></span><b> </b><b> </b><b>Tailor this to your locals/liking! Remember that, going first, Marincess can also play under cards like Skill Drain, Gozen Match, Rivalry of Warlords, and Summon Limit, to name a few!</b>"

Use the force Raye. Engage and destroy. ,"Hello everyone and welcome to my Skystriker Enforcer deck profile.  With Skystriker winning YCS Hartford with a Mystic Mine/D-Barrier variant of the deck, uptake for that particular build is no doubt going to skyrocket. With that in mind I'm opting to play a more grindy Enforcer build. The deck is solid against the rest of the meta, but is also able to laugh in the face of the mine/barrier mirror match.  3 Raye and 2 Roze is still the correct ratio. Once Linkage makes its way into the TCG Roze can be cut to 1, but with 1 Drones, Area Zero and Multirole that's roughly 7 ways to get into your Ace monsters and that's good enough for me.  Handtrap wise 3 Ash and Veiler are used, as well as 2 D.D Crow and 1 Nibiru. The deck has enough in built monster negation with Widow Anchor so I fell adding imperm is somewhat unnecessary but Veiler is due to it being required for the Accesscode Talker package. 2 D.D. Crow is really good against a lot of meta, hitting Tenyi's, Fusion materials in the grave when Albion is summoned in Branded, banishes Eldlich itself and the Golden Land traps, as well as ridding the mirror of Engage/Raye.  1 Engage, 3 Widow Anchor, 1 Multirole, 1 Hornet Drones and 1 Afterburner are fairly standard so no more needs to be said there. Where my build does differ is the inclusion of 1 Jamming Wave over 1 copy of Shark Cannon (which is usually played at 2). My reasoning behind this is I wanted an additional something to force lone backrow such as Dreaming Town or Branded fusion cards to activate prematurely, and also Shark Cannon has no utility against Floowandereeze. Waves is also decent against the mirror too.  The draw engine consists of 3 Foolish Burial Goods, 1 Metalfoes Fusion, 1 Upstart and 1 Avarice. While desires was OK with Engage at 3, it isn't great with it at 1. This build also plays a fair few important 1 of that I cannot afford to be banished. Pot Of Prosperity takes a lot of the grind game away for my liking. You either permanently lose the ability to go into the accescode engine, DPE or you lose ace monsters that could be very important if you do end up in a grind game with a lot of attrition. My view is Striker needs to retain it's extra deck to remain flexible enough for any opportunities to close the game. Goods is amazing as it puts 2 spelks in thd grave, and looping metalfoes with it for additional draws is always great. Avarice is a key card as you can recycle the Striker links, the DPE engine and the handtraps, as well as draw into 2 cards.  Lightning Storm and Forbidden Chalice are additional board breaker cards. The ED is pretty much standard. Skystriker engine links, DPE, Accescode package and Dhrac. Dhrac being a spellcaster means you don't have use up what could be a precious Effect Veiler to go into the Accesscode package, plus bringing back opposing Raye, DPE, or any dark monster with a powerful effect is too good to pass up.  3 Droll in the side mainly for Floowandereeze but does also impact any deck that searches quite often too. 2 Nib for combo, 2 Contact ""C"" is really strong this format.

I was first introduced to this card when I did a mini tournament at an anime convention where my opponent was playing a sacred phoenix dark dust spirit deck. I was impressed. The only reason I won was because I got lucky and drew a chaos sorcerer off the top, even though looking back, my deck was definitely lacking.  When I dove head first into goat format during covid, I was really disappointed with the design choices of the standard phoenix decks. Historically there have been some zombie decks that splashed a phoenix engine into their deck since it somewhat matched vampire lords effect, but it was effectively just a redundant and somewhat worse version of vampire lord. The common builds I have seen on sites have a weird defend the castle linear phoenix deck idea that is so paranoid about chaos that they run solemn judgment and multiple one for one backrow removal. The problem with this is that sacred phoenix is only good if you use it so that you can put pressure on the opponent without being so worried about their own back row. If you play defend the castle with heavy back row, you just end up damaging yourself instead of actually doing anything useful with your own phoenix since you just pop your own stuff on revival. Phoenix decks deserve better than this!  My idea is to have a jack of all trades master of none goat phoenix deck. It isn't as useful as an aggro deck in all out offense and  it will get out goated by a standard goat deck. So why run this at all? The ability for this deck to pivot in the middle of a match from a defensive to offensive, or offensive to defensive strategy while still keeping field presence and momentum is surprisingly powerful. Instead of being stuck on phoenix being your only win condition, you can choose to summon it when useful, and when you do you can be very aggressive with it, because if it is taken care of you have other options to still carry out a win.  I know I have probably committed heresy, but this deck does run 41 cards. Space is pretty tight so I decided it was better to just go slightly over than to get rid of or lower the count of certain spell/traps since the power and utility definitely comes up in longer games. That being said, consistency is not really a significant issue with the one card difference, and since the deck relies heavily on recruiters you actually go through a lot of deck thinning in the process.  The recruiters allow for you to have a defensive wall that toolboxes some powerful cards when you need them. Mystic tomato and shining angel having 1400 attack allows for you to potentially put your opponent on a clock if you need to, while still being a good defensive wall while grabbing useful cards along the way. Mystic tomato is the best recruiter in the deck, since you can grab  apprentice magician and sangan  and shining angel provides easy access to magician of faith or d.d warrior lady when you are really needing removal options. If you have tsukuyomi or book of moon you can flip magician of faith down or even go for an old vindictive magician in a pinch. Since you are running so many recruiters, creature swap becomes a very useful way to gain the upper hand. Remember, apprentice magician's old goat rulings mean that it is not usually a good card to use creature swap on, since its effect does not activate in grave, so if it is destroyed while in your opponents control they get the effect.  Kycoo the ghost destroyer is a good offensive, anti chaos monster that does really help keep your opponents at bay and synergizes well with phoenix. Breaker the magical warrior is a good standalone monster with solid attack and the ability to pop spell and traps, and also synergizes with apprentice magician since you can give it an extra counter. That being said, it does not come up a lot so it is best to think of it as a situational bonus and not get stingy with breaker hoping to keep adding counters to it. The same can be said with old vindictive magician and tsukyomi together. It can be great when you recycle it's destruction effect, but it is almost always better to use it as soon as it will give you any monster destruction as a way to keep momentum/one for one your opponents.  This deck runs a mini goat/ metamorphosis engine. This can be useful in slower games, but your strategy does not depend on you pulling it off all the time. It gives you an adaptable strategy and access to thousand eyes restrict is always useful. Sinister serpent fits in well with this engine and has synergy with creature swap and graceful charity. Book of moon is used over enemy controller since enemy controller does not have nearly as much use as book of moon in this deck. The ability to tribute a goat to snatch a monster seems tempting, but since you only have two monsters that could situationally be used to tribute that monster you steal, you are much better off with the utility that book of moon gives you. It works much better with your magician engine as well as the metamorphosis engine while also being a good battle trap alternative and way to protect your monsters in a bind.  This deck does not run a heavy trap lineup since phoenix is not good in a trap heavy deck. The traps that are run synergize with phoenix and the rest of the deck. Torrential can punish priority chaos monsters trying to out phoenix, call of the haunted plays reacting to your opponents spell/trap removal options with a phoenix, jinzo, or sangan in the grave is very powerful, and ring of destruction works with phoenix, is a great game ender, and also a solid chainable one for one removal that pressures the opponent.  This deck does have a solid lineup for using BLS, which can apply pressure to the opponent at all points in the game. Chaos sorceror is tempting, but it does end up contributing to possible bricking, and since it's not as game warpingly powerful as BLS, it is not really worth running in this deck.  While this would not likely contend with the powerful meta decks found in the goat format meta, I believe this is a much more solid take on sacred phoenix as a deck choice and creates a very fun, adaptive deck to use.  &nbsp;"

The deck actually has everything to suit me. It's a Fiend deck. It can run the Accesscode OTK thanks to also technically being a Cyberse deck. It actually really loves Unchained Abomination, and can make use of most of the best generic links. It can run a lot of interactive cards. And it is a dumb control deck where you set 5 and pass. Also, it has grind game. I really appreciate decks that can do a little bit of everything, and while the archetype is a little weak to Nibiru, it survives other hand traps admirably, and what the engine lacks in negation you can make up for with how many interrupts you can run.  New day, new list, new me. This version cut Desires to run cards I had cut on the basis of wanting to run Desires - this should enable Accesscode OTKS more often with Parallel Exceed, and I:P more often with the defensive Gamma, as well as shoring up the deck's play going second against FTKs or otherwise incredible combo decks. The main cuts were the extra Frost, 2 Desires, and some of the board breaking cards, as well as Knightmare Phoenix in the extra deck, because honestly, I never summoned that card, and we need Almiraj for Parallel Exceed plays. The list is otherwise the same - it has cut the draw power down (although the engine itself does that admirably) but in it's place it has stronger offensive and defensive tools."

If things go our way game 1, in game 2 the opponent will surely make up go first, so we side in all 15 cards and use the dangers to go into our rank 8 package with negates like hope harbinger and photon lord, and try to make apollousa as well. Our deck makes use of several different monster types so TCBOO while it does hurt us a bit, most likely will hurt the opponent more."

Generaiders to stop some plays on your opponents turn.,"A fun deck idea that I thought of when I was creating a heroic deck. Weirdly enough it actually got me a few wins at my locals. While I did lose more than I won matches, this deck managed to make certain meta decks struggle just to defeat me. I wanted to share this deck to show that there are options to make heroics fun and somewhat competitive.  So there are 2 engines and a couple of support cards  1. Heroics: There are two points to the heroics. One is to get as many heroics on the field to go into your xyz monsters. Two is hitting your opponent with massive damage or as one yugituber said ""Hit em in the Jaw.""  2. Generaider: This engine is more effective on your opponent's turn as long as you have the field spell out. You just bring out one generaider monster and spam the field with tokens, making your opponent deal with a lot of monsters.  3. Support cards like Isolde help your heroics since they are warriors and Immortal Phoenix Gearfried utilizes the equip spells you send to grave due to Isolde's effect.  &nbsp;"

This deck is a control deck, but unlike normal paleo, it has a way to summon level 8 synchro monsters using Graydle Slime Jr. You do this by summoning on to the field through one of several means, and building an endboard of halq and Toad. With this you can go into locust and a level 2 on the opponent's turn. Other than that it is a fun trap control deck using the paleo cards and other good generics like D Barrier and solemn strike. Going second the plan is to side into raigeki and dark hole in order to clear the field and set up your control board."

Because BAR can search for Scattershot from the grave, the deck uses Foolish Burial Goods and Volcanic Rocket to fetch it from the deck first, and either Magic Planter or Volcanic Doomfire can send it from the field to the grave with great effect (assuming your opponent doesn't destroy it) Other powerful traps are run to help force your opponent to mistakenly send it, and can be changed to suit the matchup (I run Mistake because my usual opponent mains Blackwings). Laval and Flamvell cards provide the rest of the heavy hitters and burn with potential for syncho summoning bigger cards and/or useful utility like Black Rose Dragon. Synchoing is made even easier with Rekindling, and you can always fill your grave using discard effects like Laval Canonneer and Lightning vortex, aside from just setting to chump block. The deck is good for casual games, and works best against monster-heavy decks. It isn't very efficient or consistent, but it does have explosive potential for nuking your opponent's monsters while chunking away at their LP, just as pyro cards should."

This can be achieved most easily with Foolish Burial Goods or milling it with the effects of Agido and Kelbek. The main strategy will be to mill your opponent completely with Exchange in the graveyard, however, with a bit of luck it is possible to actually use the effect of Exchange and swap graveyards. You can get the card fairly easily in your hand with a number of tricks such as using Keldo's ability to put -any- card that mentions Exchange on your hand or using Kelbek to set it if it's already in your graveyard.</span>  <span>Using Vernalizer Fairy of Forests and Awakening will also easily get any of your mill cards into the graveyard. With Exchange in there with Agido, you can mill your opponent for 10 cards! If you have any mysterune cards in your starting hand, a great first move is to use them to get the field spell in your hand. Notice I only have one in my deck list. You really don't need more than one of it, or the continuous spell, Deceit of the Mysterune, as they're extremely easy to get out of the deck or graveyard with the extra deck monsters. Using the ability of Spring, you can mill your opponent with a few Mysterune cards, put them back in your deck and draw for more potential.</span>  <span>A big thing to remember with the Vernalizer fairies is that after you use them you are locked into Earth monster effects! Not a big deal, except if you want to throw out a Mysterune extra deck monster to get a field or continuous spell, you need to do that first before using the Vernalizer's. This is usually very easy to do and not a problem.</span>  <span>Blast Held By Fate is another card that while amazing, I might be willing to knock down in order to get the deck to 40 cards. It's a great surprise trap that can hit your opponent hard when set. It can be searched by Keldo or set from the graveyard by Kelbek and it can be banished from the graveyard to add a level 4 fairy monster back into your hand.</span>  <span>Gravekeeper's Trap is another must have in this deck. Once again, you really only need one as it's mostly searchable by either Keldo, set by Kelbek, or directly with Mudora (Who can also put cards back into your deck!) This card can not only keep your oppoant from activating affects in the graveyard and special summoning from it, but by discarding a card (Kelbek or Agido to mill on your opponents turn???) you can add -another- earth monster to your hand. More for milling back on your turn.</span>  <span>A key thing to keep in mind when building the Mysterune side of this deck is that Mysterune works best when it's about 1/3 of the deck. That's when you'll be seeing 2-3 of them consistently in your hand. Using them right away and getting Spring on the field is a great way to mill into your Vernalizer and Agido/Kelbek. I focused on Mysterune cards that I could be more guaranteed to use to matter going first or second. It gives me the best ability to get them into my graveyard right away. </span>  <span>Obviously you need to defend yourself and that's where this deck can get a little tricky. It's meant to mill an opponent completely within two turns. Gravekeeper and Blast By Fate can help, but the biggest and easiest defender to get out is Number 41: Bagooska The Terribly Tired Tapir. This card acts as your Book of Moon (And the main reason why this version doesn't have them in the main deck.)</span>  <span>Scareclaw Tri-Heart is a Book of Moon with more ATK, though he's much harder to pull out. In all of my test hands, I only bothered pulling him out once or twice.</span>  <span>And that's basically it! Mill as fast as possible! Cause chaos! There's a lot of potential in this deck. Not only are there dozens of cards I ended up pulling out (D.D Dynamite!) but there are other archetypes that could be potentially slipped in (Tearlaments!) Below is a list of a few of the cards that just didn't make the cut, but may return in a 60 card variant. </span>  <span>Mystic Mine: I desperately tried to keep this card in and will probably throw it back in for a 60 card version. It's a great defender, but I just couldn't get it consistently in my hand. </span>  <span>Set Rotation: Wasn't consistent, but it was great to have Spring and Mystic Mine up at the same time.</span>  <span>D.D. Dynamite: My first version of this deck had two of them. I desperately wanted to keep it in, but kept drawing it when I didn't want it and then never did when I did want it. I often milled my opponent faster than I could set and use this card.</span>  <span>Vernalizer Fairy of Flower and fields: I mostly kept this one in, because I love bunnies and have two rescues... but the other two work far better in the deck. I might slip this one back in to help get a few creatures on the field to get into Tired Tapir or Scareclaw.</span>  <span>Vernalizer Fairy of Hills and Blooms: It works, but with Forests and Awakening allowing you to throw a card in the graveyard to mill and Melting Snow allowing you to draw... there's no reason to have her in here.</span>  <span>Aussa The Earth Channeler: She's great, but Vernalizer does the job a little better.</span>  <span>Cataclysmic Crusted Calcifida; Great kind of hand trap and able to mill on your opponents turn by sending a card to the graveyard, but it often got in my hand when I didn't need it and was a little slow. Might go into the 60 card version.</span>  <span>Trap Trick: This was in my first version. Ended up bloating my mill hands.</span>  <span>Book of Moon: Not needed when you have that very Tired Tapir.</span>  <span>Toll Hike: Great card to add in theory, but it never showed up in any test plays.</span>  <span>World Soul - Carbon: Great card, but Vernalizer does the job better and faster.</span>  <span>Zolga The Prophet: This was in my first build to interact with the last effect of Gravekeeper's Trap. This card allows you to look at the top five cards of your opponents deck. With Gravekeeper's Trap, if you call what they draw correctly, they discard a card. It's a great idea in theory, but you often won't have these on the field together so I ended up tossing this one.</span>  <span>Demise of the Land: Was meant to work with Mystic Mine. Ended up bloating my hand (I was running it at 3). Swapped it out for Pot of Extravagance. </span>  <span>I spent far longer than I care to admit working on this deck and am more than excited to see them come to the States. Let me know what you think and what ideas you have for this deck.</span>"

Is that too hard for you to grasp!?,"Hi guys!  So heroic got support in the new set, it’s an older archetype that, despite being interesting, is not that good.  But they just got five new cards, all of them pretty good in their own way.  Here’s my build for Heroics, in 2022.  Heroics are an earth warrior archetype using xyz monsters to get their job done. They recently got support to make an otk. I made an “ftk” list, it’s not really an ftk but it can win before your opponent does anything.  This list also has some nasty stuff it can do, particularly with the second engine I have, Bamboo.  The idea is that you can drop Excalibur, make it double, clavesolish then doubles it again, then the cursed bamboo sword lets it attack directly for game.  But if you go first there’s something different they can do, a turn skip.  Essentially the idea is to force your opponent to skip the main phases and make them pass, then swing for game, it’s pretty inconsistent but incredibly funny when it pulls off.  I will be writing up a full guide in the future for this variant of heroic."

This will push you to go down one of the paths. There is also a possibility of drawing both of the lvl5s (<em>Linkslayer</em> + <em>Red Hared Hasty Horse</em>) which would also facilitate Rank 5 plays.  <strong>Rank 1</strong> will end up with <em>Number F0: Utopic Future</em> with 6 materials (2x Lyrilusc XYZ each with 2 materials) and a <em>Linkuriboh</em>. I intend on either adding Utopic Draco Future or Downerd/Zeus to this build, as and when I can aquire them  <strong>Rank 5</strong> will end up with <em>Number 5: Doom Chimera Dragon</em>. Whilst not the best Rank 5 that can be made, it's the best that I have at my disposal at the moment. Adding <em>Overlay Regen</em> at a later date would allow for it to be boosted further  <strong>Link</strong> will end up where ever links end up. Being a low priority deck I haven't put much thought into it so I just have some casual annoyance, but ending up on the standard big bosses in <em>Accesscode Talker</em> or <em>Borrelsword</em> <em>Dragon</em> is possible with the correct build.  Overall, it is just a Kuriboh deck. The main deck can be tweaked for sure but I like that it pretty pure, without any of the standard staples or anything that take away from the uniqueness. Extra Deck is very rough, will need to see what I prefer playing and if I want to put generic boss monsters in."

Straightforward, consistent, efficient, and easy to use. ","The main gimmick of Blackwings is that when one comes out, more soon follow. This Deck runs like a well-oiled engine using Black Whirlwind to find exactly what you need, no heart of the cards necessary. Using a wide array of powerful 4 stars to put pressure on your opponent early and retrieve fellow Blackwings, mostly fetching tuners to synchro into stronger monsters with powerful effects. The most potent combo is using Auster the South Wind and Harmattan the Dust to get level 10 with only 2 Monsters. However, Dusty also pairs well with any 3 star tuner to get a Black-Winged Dragon. Black Wings also have access to good removal like Icarus Attack and Black Sonic. A playset of MST (including sideboard) and Delta Crow will also offer value against spell/trap heavy decks. The Deck is rounded out with some additional card advantage through Wing Requital and Allure of Darkness. Spells and Traps can be sideboarded out for more relevant cards like MST and Solemn Strike to counter Spell/Trap users or Book of Moon against aggro decks. That brings me to I think the most alluring aspect of this deck which is the huge surge of usable card advantage with multiple draw/fetch spells, Monsters that special summon for free and still plenty of room for customizable answers to any deck that you come across. On top of that, once you figure out which cards can be special summoned and which ones cannot, the deck plays straightforward as an aggressive beatdown deck and is very consistent with Black Whirlwind on the field. The balance between shutting down your opponents and playing to your strengths is a fine line but Blackwings soar along it gracefully."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendelum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a &lt;#907791420469956678&gt; You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendelum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a &lt;#907791420469956678&gt; You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

You can brick sometimes.  I wanted to keep this short so I left out many specific interactions between cards that you should look out for. I've been optimising and playing this deck since Master Duel was released.  &nbsp;  <strong>Goals:</strong> <strong>Dump as much of deck as possible into GY to activate effects and summon multiple negates.</strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>Step 1:</strong> Checking for and playing around hand traps:  Bait out hand traps with low value cards. <ul>  	<li>Use danger engine to bait out ash-blossom as their effect is not once per turn</li>  	<li>If you have Psy-Framegear Gamma in hand, try to bait out hand-trap into free Chaos Ruler</li>  	<li>Charge of Light Brigade discards cards even if the search is negated</li>  	<li>You have 10 cards which counter Maxx C</li>  	<li>Normal summon Raiden is good for checking for hand-traps</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Step 2:</strong> Get out Chaos Ruler or Curious  Chaos Ruler is better summon, only Curious if you are unable to go into Chaos Ruler first.  I usually summon Curious with 3 different dark monsters  Curious can send: <ul>  	<li>Felis to the GY to set up for Borreload Savage Dragon (Most cases)</li>  	<li>Starliege Seyfert to get Levianeer from GY (if Felis cannot be sent to GY)</li>  	<li>Fairy Tail Snow for more material for Link Summons and disruption on opponents turn</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Step 3:</strong> Summon Main Negates <ul>  	<li>Link Curious into Apollousa (usually for only 2 Monster Negates, the maximum 4 is overkill), so that there is a Link Monster in GY for Borreload Savage Dragon</li>  	<li>Summon Borreload Savage Dragon</li> </ul> If you still have extra resources: <ul>  	<li>Go into I:P Masquerena for Underworld Goddess and tribute opponents monster on their turn</li>  	<li>Go into Halqifibrax to summon Forumla Synchron and then Big red synchro dragon</li>  	<li>Go into Archlord Kristya if you are running that win-con</li> </ul> This is a basic end board that you want to achieve, however this deck has many different paths depending on draw and GY rng, you will have to play this deck for a long time to figure out all the possibilities.

The you want to overlay them to XYZ summon infinitrack river stormer you then use stormers effect to detach and search for Therion ""King"" Regulus you then use King's effect to summon himself and to equip the harvester or metalcruncher in your gy to him (This is your fifth summon so you have avoided Nibiru). Also with some hands you don't want to search king for example if you have a revolving switchyard in your hand you would rather search derricrain or if you have detticain in your hand you would like to search for bullet. But continuing with the king line you would link off the river stormer for a goliath and activate the effect of trencher in your gy to bring back the brutal dozer you then link off dozer for goliath the link off both goliaths for an ancient gear ballista to search for an ancient gear bot which will then search for the infinitrack tunneller. Then you activate the tunneller tribute the ballista to summon itself then link off the tunneller for a goliath and use the gy effect of river stormer to tribute the goliath to summon itself(Don't use goliaths effect) then activate the effect if tunneller in gy to shuffle the brutal dozer, the three goliaths and the ancient gear ballista into the deck to draw two cards, that's the core combo the rest depends on your hand and what you draw the main thing is that your always looking for a way to summon number 81 with a derricrain attacked to it as effectively an unaffected zoodiac drident."

Pacifis has two primary effects: <ol>  	<li>When a Normal Monster is summoned, search for a ""Phantasm Spiral"" card</li>  	<li>After the resolution of an opponent's card effect, Special Summon a lvl 8 Normal token to your field</li> </ol> Search the Phantasm Spiral trap cards to control the field and take victory. Phantasm Spiral equip cards help summon the 2900 Attk Phantasm Spiral Dragon to push for that extra bit of damage, and  Cardcar D gives draw power.  The Paleozoic trap cards not only assist in controlling the field, but also count as Normal monsters when Summoned from the graveyard, and thus can trigger Pacifis' effect to search for a Phantasm Spiral card.  Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi operates as a powerful omni-negate, and should your opponent destroy it, Summons a 4500 Attk Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon from the deck.  Sea Stealth Attack not only recycles and protects your field spell, but banishing your token as a response to opponent card effects guarantees a Pacifis search, and it also provides a destruction effect during battle for your lvl 8 token and Phantasm Spiral Dragon.  The Extra Deck should almost never be used, as it locks you out of the Phantasm Spiral card effects. Use only as a toolbox when absolutely necessary."

One thing is clear that it is the norm to not try to innovate what can be fixed; but sometimes, old norms need to be broken in order for new habits to be instated for the sake of progressing new ideas. That being said we have reached a point to where Pendulums have a chance to make a comeback in Yu-Gi-Oh's already tragic metagame. One full of chaos and disray; one full of cynicism and calamity; but also a metagame where it's not one deck or the other. Just as the ""supposed tier 0"" deck that feeds off the darkness by taking advantage of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>, and it's fusion caliber to maximize the playing field with negates, disruptions, and all other annoyances; but only to be thwarted by all others by it's own tools.  &nbsp;  Now that the dust has settled and the dragon has been slained, the Pendulum Magicians can take it's course to do all it can to retake their place, even though they lost what was once their former power harnessed from a span of over 5 years. In contrast, the first of these pieces to make a comeback from their downfall of <a data-name=""Performapal Monkeyboard"">Performapal Monkeyboard</a>; however, the problem lies in it being at only 1 copy per a deck and given that I couldn't draw it out entirely or make proper use of it during my test runs, I recommend not playing it until it at least gets back at 2 or even back at unlimited status (considering that Plushfire will less likely ever come off the banlist at all). Arguably you can search Monekyboard out with <a data-name=""Performapal Skullcrobat Joker"">Performapal Skullcrobat Joker</a> and go from there; but I argue that he has better targets (such as <a data-name=""Double Iris Magician"">Double Iris Magician </a>and <a data-name=""Performapal Celestial Magician"">Performapal Celestial Magician</a>). Regardless, this is a card that has just got off the banlist and has already circulate its preferences from many other players who had different experiences and opinions with the card firsthand, so I will take it with the grain of salt instead.  &nbsp;  Next I made some slight changes to the lineup with the addition of the Symphonic Warrior package over Scythe Lock. The reason for this is the need for 0/0 Pendulum scales to make consistent Pendulum summons more frequent if I do not have <a data-name=""Oafdragon Magician"">Oafdragon Magician</a> at hand, or if I tend to need to him to go into <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>. Now in this case, I also made it clear it could also be a justification that I could take the opportunity to test the new Synchro monster <a data-name=""Symphonic Warrior Rockks"">Symphonic Warrior Rockks</a>; as on summon he can recover a Pendulum Monster (such as Harmonizing Magician) from your Extra Deck to your hand, and can be placed in the Pendulum Zone if destroyed by battle/card effect. Also can retain the effect of the Pendulum monster recovery from the Extra deck (during the stand-by phase), but can pop itself and 1 monster that declares an attack during your opponents battle phase. It's a fun addition I wanted to do, not to give the cards any real attention or to inflate their sedimental value with hype through arrogance or over eagerness; but just an experiment I wanted to work with.  &nbsp;  Then comes the newly released link-2 monster, <a data-name=""Beyond the Pendulum"">Beyond the Pendulum</a> that allegedly was supposed to be a step up in replacing the former <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>. What I do have a problem with here is that while it does a decent job in doing what Electrumite tries to do (which is generic searching for a pendulum monster); but it locks you out of monster effects of all kinds, unless you pendulum summon during the turn you summon this card. Which means that unless you wanna pass this off and just search for any Pendulum monster to prepare for Next turn plays, you aren't exactly gonna hesitate to rush in and play <a data-name=""Beyond the Pendulum"">Beyond the Pendulum</a> immediately into <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magician"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magician</a>s or into <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. To be fair though it does a good job on it's own if you play her right, and I give it the benefit of the doubt that I expect her to see play alongside <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> if he comes off the banlist in the future.  &nbsp;  Finally I wanna talk about the other stuff I have, regardless if I have or I haven't used them. First and foremost, there was a newly acquitted TCG exclusive Pendulum Fusion monster released in the most recent set know as <a data-name=""Patissciel Couverture"">Patissciel Couverture</a>, which can place itself in the Pendulum Zone if destroyed, and can place ANY other pendulum monster from the Extra Deck in the Pendulum Zone that is face up in the Extra Deck (made possible all thanks to the infamous fusion card, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>). Next comes another recent release from the same set known as <a data-name=""Psychic End Punisher"">Psychic End Punisher</a>, Which (at a cost of 1000LP) can banish up to 2 monsters on the field (1 from each side); can also be unaffected by your opponents activated effects if your LPs are lower than theirs; and can gain Attack points equal to the LP difference between both duelist during the battle phase. Then we have <a data-name=""Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer"">Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer </a>and <a data-name=""Timestar Magician"">Timestar Magician</a>: both being Rank-4 XYZ that are useful for being generic searchers, usually used to search out components to expand further Link/Synchro plays that are needed."

This was submitted for the Novakin Membership Tournament.,"Main strategy is getting Stratos on the field either through Normal Summoning or getting him with Reinforcement, Emergency Call or A Hero Lives.  From there get Faris to the hand and throw another hero from the hand to activate the effect. Put Increase in the backrow with Faris effect. Tribute Faris for Increase's effect. Activate Increase to get Vyon who'll throw to the graveyard a hero.  From here we can go two places: - Ditch Shadow Mist if you want a card on your hand like Honest Neos - Ditch Malicious if you want to activate his effect or if you have thrown Denier there as Faris cost.  If Malicious and/or Denier are on the graveyard you want to go into Xtra Hero Crusader to get Malicious on the field for a free draw. After Malicious activate his effect to bring another one, activate Denier effect. When he hits the field choose the Banished malicious. This will allow for you to Link Malicious and Crusader into Dread Decimator and still activate Malicious effect once more to summon the one that was thrown back to the deck. With Denier and Malicious on the field you should be able to Poly to make DPE or some other hero. From here on out it's freestyle."

Get Domitianus out and time be confident on what you negate. ,"With this toolbox deck If you can get at least Special summon one gladiator beast card you can usually find an out for most situations.  With that said the deck needs good resource management.  Equestes is your recycler he will get your comebacks back after use. Play Gladiator Rejection then combo Test tiger + any glad beast, Rescue Rabbit, Unexpected Dai to get the cards needed out. usually wiht Rejection i will bring out Bestiari (although this negates the automatic trigger of destroy spell on field) it will usually allow me to summon out Gyzarus the other big boss monster out on the field and clearing the board and tagging out after.  The ultimate goal is to get Domitianus out and to protect it with handtraps, his own effect and Gladiator Rejection.  Being able to end turn with Gladiator Beast comeback in hand in case they do break your board. However this usually happens AFTER the battle phase due the GBs getting their effects after combat.  On tag out idealy you set up your Domitianus but sometimes you need to use those SS for other situations the decision making will come with practice. But main combo is Attroxi send an Augustus to GY and SS Darius to then SS the Augustus you just sent from GY; OR just SS Augustus from deck and hopefully gain an effect from your hand.

You can, on turn 1 without handtraps, leave Megaclops on the field. You can, with 2 handtraps end up with number 81 and river stormer. You can, with 3 or more handtraps leave Zeus on board. It is Beatdown oriented, and I don't carry cards like Droll &amp; Lock or Ash blossom because of its structure. If you like, you can add them. Since it is difficult, I will leave some guides to understand how it works.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX4rIQ-O_jqikmqk7X7bOZg  (Keep in mind this is a different decklist that the video shows) Credits to SuperPeludo for the guides.

Your extra is pretty much a toolbox for remaining cards or going second.  You <strong>really </strong>want to see Uni-Zombie, Vampire Ghost, and Vampire's Domain in your opening hand. Vampire Ghost+most Vampire cards typically means you can end on Beatrice to send Necroworld Banshee and Doomking Balerdroch to the gy. The deck has a lot of unique interactions-Vampire Sucker+Ghost in the grave can be a quick effect 2 tribute on your opponents turn,  and Sucker draws you a card every time Doomking revives. Rivalry+Zombie World locks your opponent out of summoning."

The deck has a lot of room for tinkering around with cards that can specifically help go against a variety of different decks. This deck doesn't contain a lot of complex combos but I will go over simple lines you can go through with different resources in your hand, remember that as this is a control deck, the majority of your focus will be playing the game in a way that counters your opponent, so your combo lines may differ depending on the match-up, but the majority of cases will use the lines I lay out. I'll start out with the most basic <strong>Aleister the Invoker</strong> <em>Normal Summon Aleister The Invoker &gt; Effect To Add Invocation &gt; Summon Salamangreat Almiraj Using Aleister &gt; Summon Secure Gardna Using Almiraj &gt; Activate Invocation, Banishing Aleister + Secure Gardna &gt; Summon Invoked Mechaba. </em>This simple line will almost always guarantee you an Invoked Mechaba from just 1 copy of Aleister the Invoker. <strong>Aleister The Invoker + Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous </strong><em>Normal Summon Aleister The Invoker &gt; Effect To Add Invocation &gt; Summon Salamangreat Almiraj Using Aleister &gt; Summon Secure Gardna Using Almiraj &gt; Activate Invocation, Banishing Aleister + Secure Gardna &gt; Summon Invoked Mechaba. Activate Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous &gt; Special Summon Ecclesia &gt; Activate Effect To Add A Dogmatika &gt; Add Dogmatika Maximus. Dogmatika Maximus Effect Banishing Almiraj For Cost &gt; Special Summon Dogmatika Maximus &gt; Activate Dogmatika Maximus &gt; Send Titaniklad The Ash Dragon + El Shaddoll Apkallone To The GY &gt; Activate El Shaddoll Apkallone &gt; Add Shaddoll Schism.</em> This line is a really explosive set-up for the deck, netting you a Mechaba for negation, two Dogmatikas on field and a Shaddoll Schism with the material to make El Shaddoll Winda already in the GY. On top of this, the effect of Titaniklad will have an optional trigger on your end phase that will let you add a Dogmatika Fleurdelis, The Knighted to your hand for another negation tool on your opponent's turn. <strong>Aleister The Invoker + Nadir Servant </strong><em>Normal Summon Aleister The Invoker &gt; Effect To Add Invocation &gt; Summon Salamangreat Almiraj Using Aleister &gt; Summon Secure Gardna Using Almiraj &gt; Activate Invocation, Banishing Aleister + Secure Gardna &gt; Summon Invoked Mechaba. Activate Nadir Servant</em> <em>&gt; Send PSY-Framelord Omega &gt; Add Dogmatika Ecclesia, The Virtuous. </em>From this point you can just commit to the combo as explained above with Aleister the Invoker + Dogmatika Ecclesia, however keep in mind the PSY-Frame Omega you sent to the GY, you can activate its effect to put itself back into the Extra Deck and put Nadir Servant back into the deck to resent your resource usage. These are the standard lines to go through while playing this deck, however there are far more things you can do, as you have a bunch of options in your extra deck to almost act like a toolbox, like summoning Invoked Purgatrio to pick apart boards and help facilitate an OTK as it can also deal piercing battle damage. Invoked Raidjin and Invoked Augoeides are good summons off of Super Polymerization, Invoked Raidjin is good to make with something like your opponent's Baronne de Fleur or their Wind Barrier Statue if they're playing Floowandereeze. Invoked Augoeides is good in games against Branded Despia or in games where someone might be playing something like Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, Invoked Augoeides is also a decent monster to help push for an OTK. As always, play around with the deck, understand what the meta you will be playing in will look like and give and take accordingly, realistically I could have uploaded this deck with the engine specific cards but I just wanted to show off some tech choices you can consider for your build.</p>"

Have an itch for bringing out the big bads of the manga kind? This deck's for you! ,"<strong><span>Lacking searcher cards, the deck focuses on whittling itself down via Trap Trick &amp; LoHP while maintaining mixed backrow options for some punishing utility. Consistency is wishful thinking for now; Witch's Strike &amp; Waking the Dragon will hopefully provide options for you if and when Avatar fails. LoHP is the deck's lifeline: backrow protection, lv10, 3k beatstick and the all-important search (Metal Slime for plays, Solemn/Witch as a contingency, Bound Creator for protection etc.).

With this in mind, there is no clear win condition: the deck is highly opportunistic and not to be played for wins. If there is a goal, it is to find that rare duel which, after exhausting all unorthodox and goofy options, the opponent is left slack-jawed with the unsuspected Exodia in place of a deckout.

Twins give the deck some good solid grind game (and with Sunny a way to beat over monsters) whereas the Splights give the twins the generic negation and protection from hand traps that they are really lacking. I like this version a lot.  Added the Twins, it really does come up. The basic route is pretty simple, just Evil Twins things. The idea is to use Splights to set up Red + Djinn Buster + Trouble Sunny, and maybe a Carrot. However, when your Live Twin gets stopped, the Splights will also help set-up Ki-sikil or Lil-la plays, usually again back by negation. Red does a lot for the deck. Weirdly enough the deck doesn't rely that much on gigantic Splight.

Note: Doom kaizer dragon is not OPT so you can use mezuki to revive him and borrow your opponent gy as your monster to make your board, this fit well with baronness de fleur when it go back to extra deck and you can sp.summon Dkd to borrow your opponent again and again  &nbsp;  With this synergies it makes your opponent <ol>  	<li>Can't activate and special summon monster from their own gy (But you can) because gravekeeper's trap with exchange of the spirit in gy will lock your opponent out.</li>  	<li>Easily make union carrier to equip buster blade dragon to your monster to lock your opponent extra deck, you don't need to worry about milled it because ishizu engine can return him back to deck and you can guaranteed equip it.</li>  	<li>Vanity's emptiness every turn from kelbek</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Try out and have fun dude.

Writing up so I can refine this monstrosity,"<span><strong>Intro</strong></span>  This deck somehow won a local. Dinomight semi limit is stellar and the eminent Inspector boarder is my saviour in a branded infected locals.  Sad time for casual decks as everyone is running branded and the branded structure deck at my locals so might as well stick to competitive and switch off of earth machine sadly  <strong>2-0 vs flunder however the fuck you spell that awful name</strong>  Went first set rivalry solemn lose 1 turn tribute summoned dinomight opponent scooped  Went second opponent set 2 cards I activated disciples to summon Ignis heat and tribute summoned dreiath III opponent scooped following turn  <strong>2-0 vs despia/branded dark lord </strong>  Went second opponent ended on mirrorjade set 1 pass. Special summoned pankratops to destroy mirrorjade at chain link 2, tribute summoned 2 dreiath III opponent set torrential tribute I attacked for game.  Went first set dimension barrier and solemn tribute summon majesty maiden opponent scoops on activation of dimensional barrier they bricked on 3 morningstar 1 superbia and one branded fusion incredibly unlucky  <strong>2-0 vs despia/branded</strong>  Went first and established inspector boarder with solemn strike and rivalry of warlords full combo won the following turn .  Went second impermed aluber and used ash on branded fusion they ended on a El shadoll winda with a negated aluber. Established dinomight and Ignis with a set solemn strike, opponent top decked aluber I used solemn strike and opponent scooped.  <strong>2-0 vs dragon link? With some synchro stuff no baronne </strong>  Went second opponent ended with hot red dragon abyss and zombie vampire. Tribute summoned dinomight knight using True king apocalypse destroyed red dragon abyss set lose 1 turn and rivalry opponent scooped on activation of rivalry of warlords  Went first normal summoned inspector boarder opponent scooped  <span><strong>Card ratios/inclusion notes</strong></span>  I own 2 ash blossoms and have no desire to spend 20 quid on another  2 pot of extravagance I ran out of time when deck building but this should be a 3 of  2 dreiath III is nice against exactly mirrorjade end phase effect or other destruction effects and if I draw 1 dreiath III and 1 majesty maiden. Two dreiath III create an annoying board if both are on field they both get protected by each others effect  0 skill drain I should definitely play this at 3 just cannae be arsed to spend 10 to 15 quid per copy  0 card of demise forgot to include it but very unlikely I would see it due to it being limited. If I did use 1 I would cut 1 Evil Eye Pareidolia  0 nibiru I don't own nibiru waiting for a reprint replace the 3 waterfall in side deck with whatever meta call handtrap e.g. skull meister nibiru d.d crow  Evil Eye cards, serziel and selene equip spell create a really annoying 1 card distruption that does not mess with the stun game plan. Gorgon sadly did not come up but having a monster negate in the extra deck that is easy to make is never a bad thing. Evil eye retribution is a target for the second serziel summon and just a good draw if you get it. Evil eye of selene can go to 2 copies  <span><strong>Weird extra deck anomalies</strong></span>  White aura bihamut, Orichalc and last warrior are all targets for Metaltron XII effect if it happens but you usually just win if you summon him as long as you tribute a spell and monster . You totally do not need the extra deck with this build and can play a monarchs erupt variant I just wanted to play an extra deck for metaltron.  I will say that relinquished anima and geonator transverser are excellent vs mirrorjade pass if you bait out the banish effect it has helped me out in my evil eye eldlich deck a surprising amount so give it a try if you can't fill up the extra deck it's very flexible.  <span><strong>Side deck </strong></span>  3 Waterfall of Dragon Souls, this searches any true draco and can unbrick your hand by discarding true dracos but is too slow sadly so this can definitely be replaced by 3 of any meta call hand trap or Bophades  3 Cosmic Cyclone, mystic mine is pure cancer also messes up eldlich trap rotation/engine this will stay until mystic mine eats a dick  3 Token Collector, is excellent against swordsoul which is another popular deck at my locals  3 Dimensional Barrier, this card fucks branded and swordsoul and the future tearalament when that hits TCG so this is staying in the side deck forever <strong>BUY THIS WHILE YOU CAN</strong>  3 Gamaciel Kaiju, a generic out to any big monster which can be dealt with in battle phase with all true Dracos except Dreiath III  <span><strong>End notes </strong></span>  Side deck is more tailored to the decks I see at my local place so results will vary and will change over the months  Just done this write up so I can refine this monstrosity and try for a 40 to 50 over the weeks.  Thank you to inspector boarder for completing my ghostrick angel of mischief playset and nabbing me an ultimate rare fusion destiny.  &nbsp;"

The Ice barrier protections and special summons for each other to make the rank 4 XYZs. Make Trishula Zero Dawn, going first, you'll get the field negated off Trishula Dragon of the Ice Barrier, and have a 3300 beatstick on board. Going second you get the pop three if they don't negate the summons and you are set up for their next turn when they destroy it and summon your Trishula then. Running Ice Knight and Silent Sea Nettle nearly make extending our Defender easy, Revealer makes it even easier.  ________  Deep Sea Diva into Guitar, Guitar effect to banish the top two of opponents deck, Guitar double Divas level, Synchro Prima Donna, Prima Donna effect to give one of the banished cards to the opponent hand (careful) and special summon level one Deep Sea Artisan, she can send your top deck into grave to special summon a level 4 or lower from grave (Guitar), then Prima Donna and Guitar synchro away for a Barronn de Fleur who can't be destroyed by card effects. One card combo.  __________  Crystron Halqifibrax special summons:  •Plan A &gt;&gt; Citree, on opponents turn, Citree effect with a level 4 in grave to make Powered Inzektron and follow up with Halq into Crystron Quandax, and Quandax into Swordsoul Champion Cheng who will off the citree play have at least +200ATK/DEF and the Opponents cards will have at least -200ATK/DEF and he will respond to any banishment with his own, also indestructible as long as you have cards in the graveyard.  •Plan B &gt;&gt; Defender or Hexa, Make White Aura Whale on your opponents turn using Crystron Halq into Quandax with any level four extender, or Prima Donna and the Token summoned by banishing Speaker from grave (assuming you used Speaker and 1 Ice Barrier tuner to make Halqifibrax).  If Zujin is in grave he can come back off the Defender to trigger Defenders protection from battle.  If Zujin is not in grave, Send him off with Defender, so next turn is set up for his return.  ____________  If you are able to get Ice Knight and Silent in turn 1 with any other level 4 you can Bahamut Shark into Toadally Awesome, protecting your plays keeping Ice knight on field, or hoping you had Defender of the ice barrier and your 3rd level four was Revealer to get him or Speaker to follow him up. You have the Defender and Ice knight and Toadally to send away off the Toads effect.  __________  General Wayne can get Ice Barrier to hand if you need to protect what you've got, then dump it for the one Kaiju, or get Medallion if you need specifics, or Freezing Chains if you want protection from extra deck monsters and have a play in grave.  In a tightspot, you can use Silent Sea Nettle to return any extra deck monsters or combo pieces in grave, or summon Mistar Boy to crash with the opponent, and Summon White Aura Whale from grave, or try to get Borrel Savage Dragon on the field when Mistar Boy and Halq are in grave.  &nbsp;  _________________________________________  HANDTRAPS &gt;&gt; a ratio I use in every deck so far to at least compete in the meta.  2x Ash  2x Maxx-C  2x Infinite Impermenance  _________________________________________  BOARD WIPES &gt;&gt; must haves when all else fails  1x Feather Duster  1x Raigeki  _________________________________________  Comments :  Prior of the Ice Barrier was too slow. The larger Ice Barriers were bricks, though Raiho can work with some changes.  I haven't had the materials to try the Atlantean Prince Nebatyss with 3x Atlantean Dragoons, but what I'm doing feels consistent.  Crystal Wing Synchro is very easy to make, could trade Borrel Savage Dragon for him.  I've seen Desert Locust played, the level 9 Crystron, the Moulinglacia but I felt what I had to remove to add them wouldn't be worth the reward.  I was playing with targets for Prima Donna other than the 1* Deep Sea Artisan and 3 cards could work if you take something out for them ; Needle Fish (when sent to GY, 1 monster your opponent controls loses 500ATK), Mermail Abyssnerei (When Sent to GY, mil a card and discard a card) works well with Zujin, Speaker, and Revealer if you already have another Revealer in hand, and Hammer Shark (Opt: reduce the level of this card from *4 to *3 and special summon 1 level 3 or lower monster from your hand.)  Open to suggestions please comment if you find something cool, or want to tell me your experience with the cards!"

This deck has a simple 1 card combo which ends on a board of Dragostapellia and mirrojade with bufocolia and triantis in scale with either a set retribution or a follow up with branded fusion for next turn.  This combo requires Lonefire/Scorpio and 1 monster to discard.  Normal summon Lonefire and then activate effect to summon scorpio from deck (Skip this part if scorpio is already in hand).  Activate scorpio's effect on summon to discard the monster in hand and special summon Chlamydosundew.  Use Chlamydosundews effect to fusion summon into Ambulomelides.  Activate Ambulomelides' effect on summon to add bufocolia to hand.  Activate Ambulomelides' effect to tribute itself and special cobra.  activate cobra to add branded fusion.  Activate branded fusion sending albaz and romarin going into Albion the branded dragon.  Chain link 1 albion, chain link 2 romarin.  Romarin to send Byblisp to GY. Albion to fuse ambulomelides and albaz into mirrorjade.  activate byblisp in GY to add Triantis.  Scale Triantis and Bufocolia.  Activate Bufocolia to fuse into Dragostapelia using Albion and Cobra.

Hi so this is my first deck sharing, when I first saw Tearalaments, I saw infinite fusion potential. So in order to make use of it's full power before the new card updates. I've added a few core fusion in the form of predaplant, tearalaments &amp; venom. I had a lot of fun with this deck and it's even called anti-meta by my friends (I highly doubt it's anti meta YET) <strong>So going through the Extra Deck</strong> <br />1. Starving Venom Predator Fusion Dragon - this will be your master negate once you've setup the whole board (both yours and your opponent) with preda counter. Even if this big fella gets taken out in your GY there will be at times one more fusion monster which you can bring back to restart or counter 2. Guardian Chimera - summon him with the effects of any of the 3 main girls of Tearalaments + Predaplant Buffolicula with Predaplant Triantis and trigger his draw effect. Although it won't have its immunity without polymerization but you will get your draw power <br />3. Tearalament Kaleido Heart - This will be one of your troublemakers for your opponent to keep sending something back into their deck and come back (once per turn) should he get sent to the GY. He will be your catalyst searcher to fusion summon extra by sending another tearalaments monster to the GY. <br />4. Starving Venom Fusion Dragon - Struggling with high attack monster? Use his effects to help you <br />5. Predaplant Chimeraflessia - Well this is another trickster... Always use it to manipulate atk values of your opponent monster. It may look like a worthless 2.5k atk monster buts its actually a 3.5k with a -1k penalty to your opponent monster that its attacking. This predaplant would also help you to find instant fusion once its in the grave... <br />6. Tearalaments Chaetocaros - She is your main catalyst of this deck to either be used as a fusion material and sent to the GY or mill some cards with the hopes to send a few cards (EG: predaplanning, any of the three girls of tearalaments) and trigger a chain effect from the GY, The only reason keeping her at 2 at the moment because you can easily bring her back because you will use her as a fusion material (always) <br />7.&nbsp; El Shaddoll Winda - Your main special summon lock. ALWAYS summon her LAST otherwise she will lock all your fusion combos <br />8. Predaplant Ambulomeloides - your searcher for predaplant and also another popper to help u pop something with preda counter on opponent field <br />9. Tearalament Lulucaros - Waifu yes but also a very cute version of D Hero Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer with a self-revive the same turn she sends herself to the GY or just send any of her sisters from the field after you negate <br />10. Time Thief Redoer -Well he's here for 2 things the effects from material detach and locking any possible cards your opponent may use against you each turn <br />11. Predaplant Dragostapelia - YAY for preda counter disabler. Use him to disable any effect before they trigger and rack up your counters for the big dragon <br />12. Raider's&nbsp; Knight - if you're thinking him as a placeholder why yes he's just going to sacrifice himself for Arc Rebellion.... <br />13. Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon - THIS IS A LAST RESORT or when you think you have the field secured for OTK purpose. I'm very 80% sure of the time you won't be using them at all the same goes for Raider's Knight <br /><br /><strong>Monsters in the Deck Summary</strong> <br />Tearalaments will be the catalyst for fusions Predaplant will be the traps to disable synchro summon, disable effects (if Dragostapelia is present) <br />Shaddoll Beast is just for draw power and Winda &nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>So why are there pendulum monsters?</strong> In a situation where you need more monsters on field to mill the deck or be used for material, this was the best answer to it because that way should your opponent take down any of the 3 tearalaments girls, they're basically asking you to summon as many as you can to ruin the board for them <br /><strong>Important Magic &amp; Trap Cards</strong> <br />Field Spell Pelreino, the Primal Parallel Ruined Realm - chain its effects with any tearalaments especially Kaleidoheart and you can clear 2 cards on the field (well this got limited to 1 but it will slow down the chains you can make with it)<br />Predaplanning - this is another one that adds problems for your opponent, if its in the GY any fusion monster u summon will allow it to be removed from play and destroy 1 card on opponent field <br />Tearalaments Heartbeats - a switcher Tearalament card, use wisely or just remove from the deck <br />Tearalaments Grief - another switcher card with a search for your trap card (this keep at least 1 in the extra deck) <br />Tearalaments Scream - KEEP 2 at all times (never use just 1)</p>"

This deck works by using the power of P.K. to be able to get both a materialless <a data-name=""Break Sword"">Break Sword</a> and a <a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a> to make an <a data-name=""Ophion"">Ophion</a> during your opponents turn, while also setting up a back of interruptions to keep you monsters in check. While this is the main strategy is by and far your only one as you also have access to strong cards like <a data-name=""Arc Requiem"">Arc Rebellion</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Requiem"">Dark Requiem</a> to close out or slow down your opponent even more so. With the plethora of starters in the game this build can be modified to fit one's one taste, even going so far as to become a 60 cards list should on desire it.  Side Note: This deck is very much capable of using the Adventure Engine to setup and easier time with the rest of the combo lines. I personally do not prefer that way but if one desires it would be easy to add it in.  &nbsp;"

By using a deck with strong otk power and good flood gate monsters like plasma and colossus. This deck has alot of potential and has alot of cool interactions.

The first two need no introductions, first is the iconic <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> straight off the banlist and ready for some action while the other one has been off for a while and has been one of the low-key GOAT's among traps, <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>. The third, and most searchable, is the impressive two card combo of <a data-name=""Volcanic Scattershot"">Volcanic Scattershot</a> + <a data-name=""Blaze Accelerator Reload"">Blaze Accelerator Reload</a>. This combo has been the heart and soul of Volcanic deck for years, being able to both build advantage for yourself and deny your opponent of board presence. Unfortunately the deck has not seen any support since 2015 and it shows. While it can get one part of the combo easily enough with <a data-name=""Volcanic Rocket"">Volcanic Rocket</a>, the other half has always been the blasting power and without it you have nothing but a card filter. Fortunately Reload has an effect while in the grave to banish itself to send Scattershot to the grave and activate it's effect that way. Now we come to the question that is a mystery to all; how do we get reload into the grave consistently?  This is where the power of modern cards comes in. There is three ways to get a card into you grave; from your hand, from your field, or from you deck. From your hand and field share the same issue being you need to actually get the card into you hand, so the better way is to get it out of the deck directly. This can either be achieved by self mill (taking cards from the top of your deck and sending them to grave) or by binning (taking cards directly from your deck to grave). While mill is plentiful, it is by far the worst of the two options since you may mill cards you didn't want in the grave to begin with. On the opposite side though, binning is better as you can send the exact card away but there are only an handful for cards that actually bin to begin with, let alone a spell/trap. There is exactly one card that can bin spell/trap's and that's <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>. One bin card isn't nearly enough, so we need another card and one that is preferably searchable/summonable and as it turns out we have that card in the form of<a data-name=""Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion""> Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion</a>. He's a hard to bring out, needing three monsters of the same attribute but different type, but fortunately we have a couple of combos for the boy.  The Classic Combo: I did not choose to use this combo but it is perfectly viable. <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> &gt; add <a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a> (this can be achieved if either or is played first)</li>  	<li>Activate Spirit Gates &gt; add <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a></li>  	<li>Use Dark Beckoning to normal summon Chaos Summoning</li>  	<li>Link away Chaos Summoning for <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></li>  	<li>Use Spirit Gates effect &gt;discard&gt; special Chaos Summoning from Grave</li>  	<li>Link away Chaos Summoning for<a data-name=""Relinquished Anima""> Relinquished Anima</a></li>  	<li>Use all three monsters on field to make Curious &gt;effect to bin Reload</li> </ol> This is the old way, though still good enough if you like it. However I have found a far better, and flexible, method to create Curious using the power of Scrap <ol>  	<li>Open <a data-name=""Scrap Raptor"">Scrap Raptor</a> (achievable through the use of <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a> as well as <a data-name=""Scrapyard"">Scrapyard</a>)</li>  	<li>Use Raptor effect &gt;destroy Raptor&gt; add <a data-name=""Scrap Chimera"">Scrap Chimera</a></li>  	<li>Normal summon Chimera &gt;special Raptor from grave</li>  	<li>Link away both cards for <a data-name=""Scrap Wyvern"">Scrap Wyvern</a></li>  	<li>(IMPORTANT! YOU MUST HAVE SET A CARD BEFORE YOU PROCEED) Use Wyvern effect &gt;summon a Scrap from grave &gt;destroy the Scrap &gt;summon <a data-name=""Scrap Golem"">Scrap Golem</a> from deck &gt;destroy set card</li>  	<li>Use Golem Effect &gt;summon a Scrap from grave to YOUR (do not misclick or you will be very sad) field</li>  	<li>Link away to make Curious.</li> </ol> The reason I like this combo more is it easier to find your starter in Raptor, and when you get to the point where you could summon Curious you have other options to link to instead. In addition, normal Volcanic decks use <a data-name=""Royal Firestorm Guard"">Royal Firestorm Guard</a>s to reset the Scattershot so that it can be used again however this is not good as it uses up your normal summon and you need to have another Pyro type in your grave. With the Scrap line you can go into <a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a> to reset if you have already Scattershot.  All in all, I feel this is a fun and flexible rouge deck that can easily go up again many decks."

Besides the <em>rokket </em>engine I am using the <em>Buster Blader</em> archetype to end in a more powerful board. The inclusion of the <em>Albaz</em> cards is for a better support and interruptions.  For the <em>dragon link </em>part of the deck you would do the same combo to end on a <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere </strong>and a <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong> with <em>typically </em>2 counters.  <strong>Dragon link basic combo path: </strong> <ol>  	<li>Summon a lv 4 or lower Dragon</li>  	<li>Link-1 <strong>Striker Dragon</strong> <ol>  	<li>Search for <strong>Boot Sector launch</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Summon a Dragon</li>  	<li>Link-2 <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> <ol>  	<li>Search for <strong>Dragon Ravine</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Dragon Ravine</strong> <ol>  	<li>Discard a card</li>  	<li>Send <strong>Absorouter Dragon</strong> from Deck to GY</li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Absorouter Dragon</strong> Effect and search for <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Boot Sector Launch</strong> <ol>  	<li>Special Summon <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>(If you manage to have another dragon on the field) <ol>  	<li>Link-2 <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere </strong>(Before using <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong> effect)</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>(If you only have <strong>Rokket Tracer</strong>) <ol>  	<li>Active Rokket Tracer effect to destroy a card and Special Summon <strong>Rokket Recharger</strong></li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon (Depending on the card that you destroy with <strong>Rokket Tracer<em> </em></strong>in this scenario that will be the amount of Counters that it will have based on the link monster in the GY.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> The Buster Blader archetype is very easy to use and is good as a backup if your opponents spend all their resources to stop your d<em>ragon link </em>combo and have a smaller hand to start their turn.  <strong>Buster Blader combo:</strong> <ol>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</strong> <ol>  	<li>Activate its effect to search for <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Set <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong></li>  	<li>(In your opponent's turn) <ol>  	<li>Activate <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong> <ol>  	<li>Send <strong>Destruction Sword Memories </strong>and <strong>Buster Blader, The Destruction Swordmaster </strong>(this step is cost!)</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Since it was cost, activate <strong>Destruction Sword Memories </strong>as part of the chain <ol>  	<li>Banish <strong>Buster Blader, The Destruction Swordmaster </strong>and <em>any</em> dragon from the GY</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Resolve and Special Summon <strong>Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</strong> and <strong>Buster Dragon</strong></li> </ol> </li> </ol> And basically that's it! Even if you opponent interrupts your search, you can use <strong>Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman </strong>to start your d<em>ragon link </em>combo since it is a dragon and level 4 monster. It can be use as an interruption bait.  In some cases you can manage to have <strong>Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</strong> in the GY and you can equip it to your <strong>Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman </strong>with <strong>Buster Dragon</strong> and have your opponent's Extra Deck unavailable!  For the <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> part of the deck is very simple, if you manage have <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere</strong> on the field there is a cool interaction with <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>.  <strong>Fallen of Albaz scenario:</strong> <ol>  	<li>Have <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere</strong> on the field <ol>  	<li>Use its effect to tribute <em>itself</em> to send back a card to the hand</li>  	<li>Since you tribute it, his other effect will trigger in the GY to Special Summon a dragon monster from your deck.</li>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> <ol>  	<li>Activate its effect, discard a card and use it to Fusion summon with an opponent's monster</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> I consider this scenario to be better than using <strong>Omni Dragon Brotaur </strong>as the summon from <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere </strong>effect, since you can have a better board and interruptions with the <em>branded</em> fusion monsters.  Also, if your opponent manages to use the effect of <strong>Nibiru, The Primal Being</strong>, while you have <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Sphere</strong> on the field. You will have the same scenario. You special summon <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>, use its effect to fusion summon with <strong>Nibiru, The Primal Being</strong><strong> </strong>and, since it's a <em>light</em> you fusion summon <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon. </strong>After that is up to you to decide which other fusion you want to make. You can go straight into making <strong>Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong>.  A good option is <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon → </strong><strong>Borreload Furious Dragon</strong>. Since you can use <strong>Borreload Furious Dragon </strong>effect to destroy your <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon </strong>and another card from your opponent. This will send <strong>Albion the Branded Dragon </strong>to the GY and at the <em>End phase</em> you can search for <strong>Branded in White</strong> to have another fusion for the next turn since you will have <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong> in the GY.  For the trap cards there's no much to say. They are self explanatory. Red Reign is a very good protection for your boss monsters since all, except links and one synchro monster, are level 8.  And that's it. I have being playing a lot with this deck, its super fun and very powerful. A lot of people never expect to be locked with the <strong>Buster Blader</strong> combo."

The main rank 4 enablers are Thousand Blades and Morning Star, so if you try to make your own heroic deck, keep in mind that you need quite a few heroics for Blades.  The real important thing is all of the cards that I <em>don't</em> run. <p>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</p> The reasons that you would want to run isolde, is that it can summon a Thousand Blades from deck which, of course, is a good payoff.  The issue with Isolde is that you actually need to make it before you can use it.  What I mean is that, the only cards that you would actually <em>want </em>to use for Isolde would be non-level 4 warriors, because making a rank 4, even if it isn't the otk, has more payoff than Isolde.  The reason for this is that if Isolde summons Blades, then you would need to have 3 heroics in hand to discard for Blades, otherwise you aren't getting any actual payoff from making the Isolde in the first place.  One could argue that you only need 2 discards since technically that would leave you with 3 lvl 4s and Isolde herself, but the only thing that gives you over the same play in a deck that doesn't run Isolde, would be a unicorn, which <em>also </em>needs a discard, albeit a generic discard, leaving you in essentially the same vice.  Wether you have 2 heroics or 3 in hand with the Isolde play, the issue is that more often than not, heroics are free lvl 4 extenders, and you wouldn't need to use material on the Isolde anyways.  Assuming that you are in a situation where you have 2 or 3 dead heroics in hand, AND you need to get 2 Isolde material on field, that would leave you with 2 cards in hand to actually be hts or board breakers. In most match-ups, that isn't enough to win, unless it's specifically the one(s) you need, and running Isolde (which would need 4+ brick equip spells, mind you) wouldn't be able to rescue you.  &nbsp; <p>Heroic Challenger - Clasp Sword</p> Fun fact for all of the 2 (max) people reading this: one of the many, MANY, reasons that I've detached myself from the rest of the ""heroic community"" (one other player and his abusive friend) is over disputes of the usefulness of clasp sword, many of which ""ended"" with me getting muted after getting insulted and yelled at for about an hour because I managed to realize that Clasp has no actual place in a heroic deck.  But all of my deep hatred of them aside, I can certainly understand why a new player with no heroics experience would believe that Clasp is useful, although I must admit I don't understand the staunch defense of it.  The reason that I despise Clasp so much, is that it just plain isn't worth making. The reason you would play clasp is so that you could add another lvl 4 heroic extender after summoning it w/ Blades (one of 2 ways to trigger Clasp, the other being Ambush Soldier), However all that leaves you with is (assuming you have nothing unrelated) is Blades, Clasp, and a lvl 4, but if you didn't run/summon Clasp, then you would be left with Blades and whatever lvl 4 you would summon off of blades.  At first glance, this seems to prove that Clasp truly does have a use. After all, it gives you another body, and since this is a rank 4 spam deck, Clasp would <em>also </em>be a lvl 4...  ...right?  It isn't. It's lvl 1.  Not to mention the fact that using Blades's effect locks you into heroics for the rest of the turn, so you can't even use it for link material.  Now, if any Extra-pilled fellow such as I were to explain this one of the filthy Clasp-pilled lot, I can assure you they would respond with ""Clasp doesn't add a lvl 4, it adds Knuckle, then you summon Knuckle from hand with its own effect, so you can make Jarn and summon a lvl 4 from your gy.""  (Side note: Knuckle will usually be classified as another lvl 4 extender, but in this case you wouldn't use its 2nd effect and it would stay lvl 1)  However, as my brothers have already figured out, the difference between using Clasp that way and not using it at all, is that using it gives you a spent Jarn.  Filthy Claspians would argue that that is better than not running it, which while technically being true, is overlooking a few things.  First and foremost, Clasp is a HARD GARNET. This means that if you draw it, it is entirely <em>useless.</em> And before someone can get a chance to say it, no, being a discard for Blades is <strong>not </strong>a use.  Secondly, Jarn's protection won't matter that late, since most always anyone would just use anything that pops would just quickfire it on the summon of Blades, so you wouldn't be able to summon anything at all. And keep in mind that, even the people who would die on Clasp's hill would agree that Blades is the only reasonable way to trigger Clasp anyways. <p>Forbidden Droplet</p> You literally just can't afford to discard a bunch of stuff, I don't really know how to elaborate at all.  &nbsp;  Now that I've gone through all of the things that I get lambasted for not running, I'd like to take this time to explain some of my ""spicier,"" as some would say, deck-building choices. <p>Denko Sekka &amp; Bujinki Ahashima</p> Yes, I know that Sekka is a thunder monster and not a warrior, just hear me out here.  If you win game 1 against a backrow heavy deck, then a Sekka backed by your 15/17 hts is usually just a free win.  Some of you may be wondering why I've paired Ahashima with Sekka, and that's because Ahashima is what you use Sekka for turn 3.  Sekka herself may not be a warrior, but she's still a lvl 4 monster, so if you summon a lvl 4 warrior on turn 3 and make Ahashima with that and Sekka, you can still make Claive assuming you have another lvl 4 warrior in your hand.  And before you ask, yes, this IS Ahashima's only use, but the ED is really open in heroic decks. <p>Extra Sword</p> I'll admit, Extra isn't important.  At all.  The reason that I run it is because it's the 2nd best thing to summon off of Blades after Morning Star, and given the fact that Morning Star is a 3 of with 4 searchers, I would like to have some back-up. If you would like to, you can absolutely replace Extra with anything else (unless it's one of the things I said to not play, as my word is next to law).  Have fun"

The main goal of this deck is to completely shut down your opponent's ability to summon anything, then lock down the duel with any combination of hand/field control options.  Ground Collapse, Ojama Knight, and Ojama King all terminate your opponents ability to use Main Monster Zones. Royale Decree negates all trap effects. Silent Swordsman can negate any spell card once per turn without cost. Robbin' Goblin can tear apart your opponent's hand. These pieces in any combination will severely gimp your opponent's ability to play the game.  Ojamagic is the hidden gem here. When sent to the graveyard, it allows you to add one Ojama Green, Yellow, And Black to hand which you can use to bring the big boy Ojama King out (or if you have an Ojama Red in hand, you can finesse out the Ojama Emperor himself). This effect is easily activated with Raigeki Break, Magical Hats, Gagaga Gardna or Ojama Country.  Big Shield Gardna is not only a beefy defender, but when Ojama Country is active he is a massive 4-star 2600 beater.  Raigeki Break has two uses here. The first is generic removal, but the second is discarding Ojamagic (which it can still do even if Royal Decree is in play!)  If you are feeling extra cheeky you could add in a Yata-Garasu for a cheeky little Yata-Lock"

You ns the Debris and use its effect to summon Lightning from the gy, and then you synchro summon a Shooting Riser Dragon. After that, you use REDMD or Flash to get another lvl 3 non-tuner on field, and use Riser to synch with it for Baronne.  At least, that's the main combo. Of course, as a Tier 6 far sub-rogue deck, the main combo doesn't always happen, which is why I play things like the full Armedra package.  If you have a lvl 3/ flash and lvl 5, then you can summon the lvl 3, use it's effect discarding lvl 5, lvl 5 gy eff adds lvl 7, lvl 5 on field eff discards lvl 7, lvl 7 gy eff adds Armed Dragon Lightning, Armedra Lightning adds lvl 3 from gy, lvl 7 on field discards the lvl 3 to summon lvl 10, lvl 3 gy eff draws one.

I built a Gem-Knight FTK deck in master duel. The deck works incredibly well.  Your job is two things, one trigger block dragon and two get Gem-Knight fusion out of your deck, once you do that take it from there and ftk them.  The backup plan is dpe pass and if you REALLY brick hard then try surrendering but most times you’ll be able to make a play of some sort.  When you ftk it’s usually this setup, 6 monsters all special summoned including a lady lapis lazuli and master diamond along with a gem-knight monster in your hand usually achievable and gem-knight fusion in your graveyard with a banish target.  What you do from there is pitch another lady lapis lazuli with the first one and use master diamond to do the same for 6000, then you use gem knight fusion fusing the gem-knight in your hand, master diamond, and lady lapis lazuli for a second master diamond, who pitches for game.  If you want you can swap out Seraphinite for another master diamond to give the deck more wiggle room but for me the first two master diamonds are usually good enough at preforming the ftk themselves."

(the other one is in the side for going second against decks that can't deal with it.) be carful about when you activate neos fusion he's not just straight broken like dragoon or enforcer if they have an answer it can mess you up a lot. Also by no means do I think this is the best version of 60 eldrich so just have fun with it and make changes as you see fit. :)

Extra Deck is customizable.  Updated the list and giving a more indepth explanation of my card choices  3 Naturia Molcricket and 3 Naturia Camellia - The core of the deck. Both of these cards sets up the other and are the best normal summons in the deck. Sets up your graveyard to disrupt your opponents plays. Most games begin by getting both of these cards into rotation. Camellia is also a tutor for any naturia cards by sending Naturia Sacred Tree and Molcricket can help you catch up going second.  3 Lonefire Blossom - Extra copies of Camellia. Can also be used to start your Therion engine.  2 Naturia Marron - By far the weakest starter in the deck but sometimes Marron send Molcricket is all you got. Other than that it recycles your naturias for grind games.  1 One for One - Summons Molcricket without taking your normal summon, lets you end your first turn on boards that aren't just Camellia + Regulus  1 Foolish Burial - Sets up graveyard, sends Molcricket or a therion in a pinch  3 Foolish Burial Goods - Essentially ROTA here. Sends sacred tree to search any Naturia Card  3 Therions' ""Lily"" Borea - You probably know why this is here. Search the field spell to get Regulus for an omni. Also can send Sacred Trees you've drawn to search.  1 Therions' ""King"" Regulus - Big stats, omni negate, level 8 for Dingirsu  1 Therions' Ring, The Colosseum Saucer - Searches your Regulus, pretty great in a grind game as well. Bump this and Regulus up to 2 if you want  Naturia Tool Box  2 Naturia Horneedle - This is your main source of disruption. In tandem with Camellia and Antjaw can be triggered quite a few times.  1 Naturia Sunflower - Monster negate. Pretty strong if you have Camellia, otherwise the cost is steep  1 Naturia Antjaw - Ammo for your tribute effects, could get away with running more of these but i didn't feel it was necessary  1 Naturia Rosewhip - Floodgate summonable off of Halq. Can be used to completely shut off your opponents Spell/Traps  1 Naturia Vein - Spell/trap negate. Same deal as Sunflower but can be used with Rosewhip to completely shut off Spell/Traps  These next 3 are only in the deck because their level is convenient or are pretty good extenders  1 Naturia Hydrangea - having a level 5 is nice to summon off of Molcricket if you need a synchro monster quickly. can summon itself.  1 Naturia Cosmobeet - Just wanted a level 2 tuner  1 Naturia Ladybug - The best of these three by far, I use it in my turn one combos often as link material for Seraphim Papillon. Seraphim, Beast, Regulus and Molcricket is a pretty doable setup  3 Naturia Spring Breeze - Really good spell. Is by far the best extender in the deck and can be used on your opponents turn to drop synchros. Not a single once per turn on this card.  3 Naturia Sacred Tree - Had this at 2 but it proved to be a very good card to send for costs. Its non-search effect is sometime relevant as well.  1 Called by the Grave - Getting handtrapped can sometimes turn your entire deck off. Honestly probably should cut some of the worse naturias to run a Crossout Designator package.  3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - i just picked the first hand trap to come to mind.  Extra  Naturia Exterio - Probably never gonna summon this but its better than Gaiastrio  Baronne De Fleur - Its the best synchro monster in the game  Borreload Savage Dragon - The second best synchro in the game, although i often find myself in situations where i haven't summoned a link monster to equip to it  Naturia Barkion - Doesn't come up very often, its really here just to have another naturia name for ladybug so any of the other synchros would do this is just the least bad of them excluding beast  Naturia Beast - incredibly good and very easy to summon. often a piece in my better setups  Herald of the Arc Light - Its another omni  Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton - Big negate monster, my Strenae target  Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star - Cleans up the board on the crack back.  Strenae the Rikka Queen - Recycles your Camellias and Lonefires. tribute it to aromaseraphy jasmine to summon Hyperyton  Meliae of the Trees - never summoned this but i'd rather have it then not  Accesscode Talker - You know why this is here  Knightmare Unicorn - Mostly to climb into accesscode  Papillon Seraphim - Proactive way to get Molcricket back on the board. Sometimes if i already have a molcricket in rotation i'll send a Horneedle to the graveyard to summon with this  Aromaseraphy Jasmine - Not sold on this TBH, might go with Crossrose Dragon instead, much easier to summon but needs another monster in the extra as a target.  Crystron Halqifibrax - Theoretically has some pretty powerful setups, i haven't practiced them yet so i have no idea what to do here. Could always put a Jet Synchron in the deck  Cards im considering  Naturia Mantis - Might be a sideboard card for Floo but the cost kind of doesn't jive with the deck  Naturia Ragweed - Might be good if you're running more handtraps than i am and you know your opponent is running draw spells.  Naturia Stinkbug - Could potentially make you unkillable in a grind game  Crossrose Dragon - alternative to Jasmine. Needs another extradeck slot which isn't a big problem, you can do anything with the extra deck.  Periallis, Empress of Blossoms - My Crossrose target of choice, summons Borea from the grave  I:P Masquerena - You create a ton of material on your opponents turn  Apollousa - I:P Target, but i dont feel like you can summon it early enough for it to do much  Retaliating ""C"" - Decent handtrap, relevant typing  Contact ""C"" - for the Realiating search  I've considered insect stuff but i dont think theres enough synergy there, Resonance Insect has potential but i don't think theres enough Doom Dozer targets in this deck.  The other Naturia spell traps dont have Naturia in the name making them unsearchable so i don't think they're consistent enough to justify. The field spell search is okay but you dont really want the naturias in hand unless you're running mantis.  No draw spells, didn't seem necessary, the new support makes the deck Super consistent  All in all I think the new support is exactly what the deck needed. Naturia has always had a lack of enablers for their low key busted effects but Molcricket and Camellia do exactly what the deck wants. The strengths of the deck lie in being very, very consistent and adaptable but its still not very capable of power plays. I think you can win games with it, its just not easy due to nonlinear setups and having to know which Naturias are relevant in matchups.

Slifer is there as a floodgate. Why I play 1 copy of Hootcake &amp; Mesangelo is because they're garnets.

This deck can handle Swordsoul, Despia, Adamancipator, and even tri-brigade thanks to numerous cards such as: A negate (Mechaba) A floodgate (Winda) A Second negate (Fleurdelis) A second floodgate (If winda goes to gy [Caliga]) etc...  This deck is easy to learn, and is one of my favorites so far! Please, leave any suggestions in the comments. ------------------------------ This deck is very linear, so I'll show an example combo to show how it works. Normal Summon Aleister the Invoker, add invocation, summon almiraj, summon secure gardna using almiraj, activate invokation and summon mechaba. Now you have a 1 card combo w/ a negate on board.  Dogmatika monsters are used as some sort of engine to get another negation on board (Fleurdelis) but also have a great sinergy w/ shaddolls (Maximus sending to gy Apkallone, etc...)  Shaddolls are used to get construct or winda quick, so its pretty useful!

Here's my take on the deck (Based on the TCG banlist, though the only things i'd consider from OCG are Maxx ""C"", Dimensional Fissure and Macrocosmos)  Here's the explanation of uses and ratios:  <strong>3x Kshatri-La Fenrir/Unicorn/Ogre</strong>: As of yet the only main deck Ksha monsters, they search Monsters/Spells/Traps respectively while also disrupt the opponents play by banishing cards facedown. Normally you see a 3/3/3 ratio on the lists and the reason behind that is, well... There's barely any other choice, the archetype is still quite small so it really relays on swarming from deck, either way, the three of them are very good cards that almost never represent a brick on hand.  <strong>3x/1x Danger! Nessie!/Dogman!:</strong> One of the examples of ""easy"" to summon lv7 monsters, and after some testing, arguably the worst ones, yes they're extenders and give some draw power (la berth combos with them). BUT the random nature of Danger! makes them really unreliable, a wrong discard can be really detrimental and by themselves (no other cards on hand) they're practically useless. The 3/1 ratio obviously goes on favor of Nessie since she's the searcher.  <strong>3x Instant Contact/The Ascended of Thunder</strong>: Really good extenders and combo pieces, basically free lv7 bodies on board anytime, anywhere, just by giving LP (like, does that even matters in modern YGO?, lmao), the ascended of thunder it's not even OPT. 3/3 is a must.  <strong>2x Psi-beast/Astral Kuriboh</strong>: A tricky pair. Psi-beast comboes really well with la berth/prepare to extend even further and Astral Kuriboh is a free lv7 that can make a harder to get rid of Diablosis/Harmonizer (remember that this is a lingering effect, so even if their effects get negated they remain indestructible) .The only reason i don't just dump the dangers and play 3 of each is because of ""Seven Star Sword"", which needs a lv7 monster aaaaand, thinking it again, i may just do that. Needs some testing tho.  <strong>3x Ash/Imperm</strong>: Nothing to explain here, just the HT's (if you want to swap them for other one go ahead).  <strong>1x Pankatrops</strong>: Kinda a tech. Is only useful on turn 2 onwards but gives isolation and puts pressure on board, may be drop on an update.  <strong>3x Seven Star Sword:</strong> A staple on the deck, not only the draw power is really good, it also comboes with ksha by using la berth/prepare to just re-summon the monster you just banished.  <strong>2x Pot of Desires/Triple Tactics Talents</strong>: Still not convinced with desires, yes, since this list uses 3 of each ksha monster is really unlikely you'd just banish 3 copies of the same one, but i just don't like to risk it, you know?. TTT is basically called by cope, another option would be a handtrap such as veiler/droll. Desires is semi-limited and 3 TTT is an overkill, so i think 2/2 is okay.  <strong>3x Kshatri-La Berth</strong>: I can see why some people won't run it at 3 like i do, but it's just so useful, to the point where you want to see it in your opening hand, even if the following copies are unusable, it's just great.  <strong>1x Kshatri-La Prepare</strong>: Useful, but not as useful as La Berth, if by some misfortune i lose it, well, i'll just have to deal with it.  Extra Deck:  Instant contact targets, various R7NK options to deal with various situations and Soldier of chaos because we are using lv7 monsters. But the most important ones are ""Kshatri-La Shangri-La"" which gives you the swarming capabilities to out-resource your opponent while also blocking their zones. ""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"", Shangri-La's sidekick, by removing from play cards directly from the Extra Deck you can really block your opponents play, and he's an huge contributor of shangri-la's lockdown. ""Number 76 Harmonizer Gradielle"" another target for astral kuriboh, a decent way of disrupting plays by attaching opponent's monster from the GY.  (Still testing)"

Problem is, there are so many tournament decklists, why bother writing up my own. Not because it's bad or worse but because tournament decks have a level of credibility other decklists don't. So there's no reason for you guys to check out my regular Salamangreat list if you could netdeck one that topped. *insert bragging about being 4-1 at regionals with Salamangreats and then delete this note* I'm not playing some weird tech either that would make it worth discussing over. My Salamangreat list is the most basic it's ever been: Bufferlo, Salamangreats, Heatsoul and Handtraps. I will say I fell in love with Will of the Salamangreats again and put it at 2 after playing it at 1 since forever and I love it and Bufferlo always has and always will be the best card in the game! See, 2 sentences and you've probably figured out my entire decklist by now without even looking at it. </span>  <span>After extensively making clear as to why you don't need a Salamangreat decklists coming from me, here's a Salamangreat decklist :-)))))) SIKE! Well, sike but also not really sike. It's not how I would advise you to play Salamangreat. Earlier I said I didn't play any tech cards, right? So this list is ""<span>What If: Salamangreats were teched to the brink?</span>""</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Cyberse Techs</span>  <span>We had Dragon Link and then recently Plant Link as link decks that revolve around a type rather than an archetype and while Cyberse has pretty much always been able to, Heatsoul is what started making Cyberse Link a viable choice recently. But what I didn't like about that is how they used Salamangreat as an engine to get into Heatsoul. No Rage. No Roar. So this is the Cyberse Link stuff cramped into a Salamangeat deck. The gameplan is unchanged. Make Sunlight Wolf or Heatsoul but now you can end on either an omni negate that banishes and/or an omni negate, a handloop and monster removal on top of it.</span> <ul>  	<li><strong><span>Code Talker</span></strong> <ul>  	<li><span>You're probably familiar with this one.

Disclaimer I did not put in the newer card. You can substitute the hand traps with any other hand trap or even pots; (forbidden droplet would probably make this deck better but tbh I haven't bought the card so I didn't ""test"" it in this deck).  This deck helps you work around almost any deck. how you use it is that using the Invokers as the muscle and the pushup as the engine/""emergency backup"" Because you are playing invoker you'll have access to many combinations and safe guards. In this deck your elements (for invoke) will consist of Fire (mainly), earth, and dark. You can use other elements if you want to use hand traps as materials (ogre for example--has come in handy).  The Suship engine uses the Invoker field spell to activates its own effects.  DPE- Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer can be summoned through Invoker's Meltdown. The down side is that you'll have to gather the materials by drawing; which can be covered through the drawing mechanic of Suship and any pot cards you can substitute. The reason I put plasma and dogma is because of Destiny END Dragoon (it has defiantly came up several times) and it also gives you more opportunity to summon either.  &nbsp;"

If you have something like <em>Witchcrafter Creation, </em>use it to add <em>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru </em>for protection and a bounce on one card your opponent controls, if he tries to attack your Vice-Master or try to destroy it. After that your focus should be to get <em>Witchcrafter Madame Verre</em> on the field, so you can have a negate on all your opponents face up monsters that he currently controls by discarding one spell from your hand which you can immediately add back by using Vice-Master's effect. If your fusion summons are disrubted, try and summon 2 of your level 8 monster on your turn so you can at least go into Number 38 to have some protection. If the dragons that you used to get Vice-Master on the field are still alive on your next turn you can go into Dingirsu or Number 38 depending on the situation. You cna also use Vice-Master to try and destroy Dingirsu with her destruction, then send one of the materials to the graveyard and if it's Albion, </span><span>during the end phase add one<em> Branded Fusion </em>or <em>Branded Opening</em> depending on if you have a DARK monster to use for 2 other dragons. </span>  <span><em>Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</em> is just a backup if you can't go into Vice-Master as it can send something like Ash or Abyss Dragon to the graveyard to add more Branded cards in the end phase and non-target banish one monster on the field. </span>  <span>Getting the lower level Witchcrafters will be easy for you with Vice-Master's effect and with them you can special summon one of the higher levels Witchcrafters by discarding one spell but with Vice-Master's third effect you essentially do this for no cost, as you can add back the spell card you just </span><span>discarded. </span>  <span>If by any chance your opponent tries to destroy your fusion monsters by a card effect, you can just banish <em>Branded Fusion</em> and protect them  </span>  <span>This is my first time making something like this, i hope you enjoy the deck!</span>"

But. If you do, each engine should be able to get out their own monsters on their own, and for anything else, there's Drytron.  Manju and Prep can search Sauravis if necessary. If you *really really* want to, you can run Sprite's Blessing to actually summon Sauravis (and any other light attribute ritual in the deck).  Pre-prep can search Libromancer Bonded and Fireburst if going for an OTK and Firestarter if you want to give Fireburst added protections. Mystigirl enables this by reducing one of their ATK position monsters to 0.  Extra Deck can also run 1 N'tss 3 Arc Light or vice versa if you prefer.

The main idea of the deck is that your gameplay is setup into two separate parts: before pendulum summoning and after pendulum summoning.  The solfachord engine works amazingly to setup for a card like Beyond The Pendulum, which can then search for a missing pendulum scale (usually gate), harmonizer magician as it leads to halq very easily and special summons more material, or Gracia so you can get your field spell out. After your pendulum summon you will mainly be relying on your dark engine pieces (mainly the phantom knight cards unless you draw into Arma) to generate resources because a large majority of the time you will be able to link Beyond The Pendulum and another dark monster such as a plague spreader or darkwurm in order to go into rusty bardiche. From that point you can send cloak, set the brigandine, banish the cloak to add boots, and get creative with the raw amount of materials you can now put on the field. This concept was developed after realizing the deck does not need cards like Loagaeth as they can already get the materials on board for BTP fairly consistently, but struggle to find more resources after pendulum summoning. Cards like Diviner of The Herald are still AMAZING in Solfachord, the only problem is that I am not an oil baron who can drop $240 on a playset of them compared to this much cheaper and equally as effective alternative. Despite being a 45 card deck I have found that its incredibly consistent and also can not think of any cards to take out, if you have any ideas of cards to take out or some ideas on how to improve the deck please shoot me a message on twitter @Gliscare.  &nbsp;  Basic Combo: Assuming a two card hand of Cutia + Dragon Shrine you can go into the following: Dragon Shrine Send Darkwurm, special darkwurm, add Gate Zero Normal Cutia, add Dreamia Darkwurm + Cutia make BTP, set  Gate and Dreamia as scales Add harmonizer to hand Pendulum Summon Cutia, Darkwurm, and Harmonizer. Activate Harmonizer to special summon Oafdragon BTP + Darkwurm to make Rusty Bardiche, Bardiche send cloak, set Brigandine and special summon it, banish cloak add Boots and special summon Boots Harmonizer + Cutia, Boots, or Brigandine to make Halq, special summon plague spreader Plague Spreader + Oafdragon make Borrelload Savage Dragon, target BTP in grave From here you can either make a three material Apollousa or use the leftover materials to make IP, then use IP + Halq to make Avramax which can be very hard to out if your opponent is not ready for it. Banish boots and set fog blade  In addition to that combo theres also a number of extensions you can do via Armageddon Knight by sending cards like Zephyros to the grave so you can summon a hand trap off of halq and then bounce it back to your hand with Zephyros or by sending Malicious to grave for extra material. Whatever you do the deck is shockingly versatile and is an absolute blast to play once you start looking into it more and more. The deck can play through a negate or two depending on the hand, though as it is still solfachords it is painfully fragile at times hence why cards like Instant Fusion and Called By The Grave are here.  ""Why is Instant Fusion Here"" Instant Fusion is always an amazing card to draw as it can summon Restrict to protect your Cutia, BTP, or Armageddon Knight from being negated or you can summon Ciel to have a pendulum for BTP in a pinch (it comes up alot more than you'd think). Ciel is an espescially good target as you can pendulum summon her back to the field like any other face up pendulum monster so she can recur herself if you have the proper scales."

By using the quick effect of Rakea or Escape of the unchained you can destroy your monsters during Battle Phase for extra dmg).  After some iterations (also playing this deck as Evil Eye + Unchained), I can say this deck has reached a fairly balanced state. Going first or 2nd is completely valid.  Going first I try to end on I:P, Soul of Rage and Rakea. This allows me to activate the effect of I:P and chain Soul of Rage as CL2 right after a monster has been summoned by the opponent. Linking into a link 3 with a monster of the enemy and link into a link 4 (unchained abomination or avramax) with I:P. Rakea could now trigger abominations effect.  Elsewise the deck is built so that enemy bord destruction is allways possible.  Side deck is almost only for playing against backrow heavy decks."

I was bored and decided to spend more time practicing on utilizing obscure and absurd tech options with rogue decks. That being said, today's deck is basically a can of Whoop-Ass; but that said can has maggots, cockroaches, and possibly mosquitos infected with malaria virus. To fix this, I disposed the said can of Whoop-Ass, and replaced it with a fresh can of actual fresh tasting utilities and flavor. Now we must proceed to the usual descriptions of what it is that said current thing of thing, because it is my job to do so.  &nbsp;  First and foremost, <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma </a>is no more; but if you can't make proper link plays and have <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> ready to be played, then you can go for pass for your opponents turn. Now besides what I mentioned earlier, one in particular I have been working on utilizing for Mathmechs is the newly released Link-3 monster, <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a>: a link monster that has a quick effect that draws 1 card for 1000LP (during either players turn); and can Special summon a Link-3 or lower Cyberse monster from your Extra deck (if your LP's are 2000 or lower) by banishing the card from the field. Now, I have also used the <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> pass with <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a>, and I prefer it over <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> for reasons of consistency over OTK utilization. Plus given I can have proper target for <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> given I have used most of my Link monsters for <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>.  &nbsp;  Next comes the other stuff I have worked with that I never expected to use; but used anyways for better or worse. Despite the banning of <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> can still be utilized in two different ways: either with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax </a>to <a data-name=""T.G. Wonder Magician"">T.G. Wonder Magician</a> (which was the most easiest and common way of activating the Scythe Lock); or a Link-2 monster within the Artifact archetype known as Artifact Dagda (which can set it during either players turn when an effect is played; but is destroyed during the end phase, which makes it more predictable). Then comes the newly limited card <a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart </a>(which allows you to control a monster until the End Phase, regardless of what type of monster it is). Honorable mentions in my deck include <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> (which is a +2, -1 if removed from the field), <a data-name=""Primathmech Alembertian"">Primathmech Alembertian</a> (an XYZ monster that just searches for Mathmech pieces such as ""Mathmech Diameter""), and <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> (special summons itself from the hand if you link summon during your turn, then special summons another copy of itself from your deck; but both copies are treated as LV4)."

So after hours of searching through different archetypes trying to find cards that I believe roughly resemble the gagagigo/lizardman look I ended up with this, The Lizardman Aliens deck. The engine of this deck is the Alien archetype engine, unfortunately unlike my other decks this one didn't meld together as well but it's still a functioning deck although pretty slow sometimes depending on your hand. If you're a fan of casual slower games this deck is good for you however against pretty much any other casual deck you'll probably get stomped.  The point of the decks I am making is to take a theme I like and make a cool deck with it and as long as the deck functions properly and is cool then I'll post it.  Anyway, thanks for checking out this weird Lizardman-Alien deck!"

Often times you also put a <strong>Fairy Tail Snow</strong> in the grave to have more points of interruption. The deck uses its crazy amounts of extension and high potential boards to completely shut out an opponent going first and to push through interruptions going second. </span>  The most basic combo of the deck only needs <strong>Rite of Aramesia </strong>and any <strong>Tuner</strong> monster in the deck. The standard combo of the deck needs <strong>Rite of Aramesia</strong><strong>, </strong>Any<strong> Normal Summon</strong>, and any<strong> Extender</strong>.  Dragon Link has many powerful extenders like <strong>Chaos Space &amp; Quick Launch</strong>. Both cards create loads of card advantage (Both are normally a plus 2-5 in card advantage) and allow you to extend into more plays.  The deck is very consistent. With my testing, the deck has a <strong>9/10 for playable hands </strong>with <strong>7/10 being full combo</strong> (low on bricks) and an average <strong>1 hand-trap/going-second card per hand</strong>.  One weakness of the deck is a lack of going second card room, this is why I main <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong>, for its high impact in the current meta going second.  The last cards I want to mention are <strong>Chaos Dragon</strong> <strong>Levianeer &amp; Chaos Ruler The Chaotic Magical Dragon.</strong> Due to the deck's playstyle, it is not as consistent to get Levi into rotation but it is still viable as an extra option for massively powerful effects such as <strong>Non-Targerting Destruction x2 &amp; Hand Ripping</strong>, both effects a plus 2 in card advantage and very impactful. Chaos Ruler is the gambler of the deck. He enables a powerful boss monster in <strong>Hot Red</strong> and gives you the potential for massive amounts of advantage in sending 4 cards into your grave and 1 to your hand (Normally E<strong>ffect Veiler</strong> or a Levi).  I don't think it's an unpopular opinion that Dragon link is very hard to pilot, and while I do think that the use of the adventure engine makes the deck easier to play I don't think that the higher ceiling of difficulty is gone. Because at the core the dragon link cards are the cards that win you games. <span><strong>Borrelend Dragon </strong>is the new MVP of the deck and frankly, a lot of decks don't have consistent ways to out the card making it a real obstacle for some players.</span>  Thank you for reading and I hope you try out the deck :)  DB- BumpyBlue"

This version is a more of a place holder while I experiment with exact ratios. This may be updated again in the near future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this re-write I'll be going over the new combos, how this deck fairs against the meta and how to overcome it, and cards to swap in if the deck isn't quite working for you. For those re-reading this, I'll cut to the chase and start off with the new stuff so you don't have to re-read everything:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ancient Gear Ballista-</strong></p><p>This card is the predecessor of Crystron halquifibrax for this deck. It's a link 2 that takes 2 earth machines, on link summon, It adds Ancient gear from your deck to your hand. Ancient gear can special summon itself, or be used as a Discard for Knightmare Unicorn during a Telefon loop. Furthermore, Ancient Gear Ballista can pop Clockwork Night to give you Clockwork night's search effect and make an opponent's monsters ATK drop to 0 to help with OTKs. That's the card's use on it's own, but there are combo's for it, though I haven't discovered it's full potential as I only thought of using it last night. Alongside Urgent Schedule, this card takes you from brick to a minimoun of a Link-2 and 3 bodies on board and can tie into P.U.N.K combos if your opponent has an earth monster. So start off by summoning Gizmek Tainguku and Gizmek Uka with Urgent Schedule. Use both as link material for Ancient Gear Ballista, and use Ballista's effect to add and special summon Ancient Gear. Then banish Gizmek Tainguku to special summon Gizmek Uka from your gy, this triggers Uka's effect to special summon a monster from the deck. And the combo you go into from there vaties on what's in your hand and what you were able to summon from the deck. It can get as good as I:P Avramax + Hope Harbinger + Zeus off of just Urgent Schedule alone. This combo and the Garunteed discard for Knightmare Unicorn are all I've discovered for it so far though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Telefon Looping Methods-</strong></p><p>Sadly Halquifibrax got banned, but, there were enough ways to get Telefon on the field that Machine Duplication could pick up the slack. Telefon looping is done by having a Telefon on the field, and one in the gy. Telefon can summon Telefon from the gy, then use the Telefon that did that as material, then the newly summoned Telefon can summon the other Telefon back from the gy, causing an infinite summon loop that lets you gain LP in the process. So the first method is to-</p><ol><li>Summon a Single Telefon(Normal summon/Gizmek Naganaki effect/Urgent Schedule effect/Gizmek Tainguku effect/Gizmek Uka uka effect/Small world then normal summon).</li><li>Activate Machine Duplication, this summons 2 more Telefon to your field.</li><li>Use 2 Telefon to link summon Ancient Gear Ballista, and activate it's effect to add Ancient gear to your hand. Then loop both back.</li><li>Use 2 Telefon to link summon I:P Masquerena. Use Ballista And Masquerena to Link summon Mekk Knight Crusadia Avramax. And loop both back.</li><li>Use 2 Telefon to Link summon Qliphort Genius. Loop both back, then, use Genius to negate one and a card your opponent controls. Then use the negated telefon and Genius to link summon Knightmare unicorn.</li><li>Use Unicorns effect to discard Ancient Gear to shuffle a card your opponent controls back into the deck. Then use it and a Telefon to link summon Accesscode Talker.&nbsp;</li><li>Loop 1 Telefon back in DEFENSE POSITION, this Telefon will let you look at up to the top 6 cards of your deck depending on the dice roll, and organize them however you like, and if you don't like them, Telefon lets you put the cards on the bottom of your deck. Use both remaining Telefon to xyz summon Assembled Nightingale. After the battle phase, Nightingale can be used as xyz material to summon Zeus.</li></ol><p>Depending on what else you could get on the board, it's possible to make a combo consisting of up to 3 of 4 negate Apollousa, 3 negate Borreload Savage Dragon, Barrone de fleur, Hope Harbinger, Therion King, and Chengying in addition to the 5k Accescode &amp; I:P Avramax &amp; Zeus that the Telefon loop gave you.</p><p>The second Loop is a lot harder. You need to get 3 Telefon on the field/gy using any number of these different methods, before repeating the previous loop into your 2 link-4s and Zeus. You can use-</p><ul><li>Normal summon Gizmek Naganaki, then special summon Gizmek Arakami with its own effect. Tribute Arakami using Naganaki's effect to special summon Telefon from the deck. The banish Arakami using its own effect to send a Telefon from the deck to the gy.</li><li>Using just Naganaki or Arakami.</li><li>Sending Telefon from the hand to the gy via Foxy Tune or Clockwork Night effect.</li><li>Normal summon a Telefon.</li><li>Use urgent Schedule to special summon a Telefon from the deck.</li><li>Activate Gizmek Ukas effect that special summons Telefon/Gizmek Naganaki from the deck.</li></ul><p>And loop once you have the three Telefon. In the instance you draw a bunch of cards you can special summon via their own effects, it's possible to Telefon loop using just 2 Telefon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other new stuff-</strong></p><p>Ash blossom and Infinite Impermanence were added for disruption in place of a few cards you'll notice missing such as the field spells. With all the new cards that didn't have balanced stats, and and the 3 more spells, Gizmek Scrolls become less consistent. Therion discollusseum wasn't drawn enough to be a keeper over my other options to take out, so Terraforming followed suit. I took out the Chimeratech board wipe for being inconsistent, and I took out a Foxy Tune since you only need to search it once. Silent Grave Yard was added to the side deck to help against Tearalaments, and Ojama Trio was added to fend off Mystic mine(gives your opponent 3 monsters so you can mak unicorn to shuffle Mystic Mine back into the deck.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Qliphort Genius combos-</strong></p><p>Back to old stuff again, however Ancient Gear Ballista does spice up this old combo. Qliphort genius is a Link-2 that can negate a monster's effect you control other than itself to negat a face up card your opponent controls. It's unaffected by spells and traps so if it was out before skill drain was activated, it can negate it for the turn. In adition to that, it has another effect that let's you add a level 5 or higher machine from your deck to your hand if 2 monsters are summoned at the same to the zones it points to. The old play was to summon 2 machines(Arakami/Naganaki/Orochi/Uka/Therion King), then link them off for Genius. Then activate Urgent Schedule summoning 2 machines, then activate Genius effect to add Gizmek kaku. Banish Arakami you used for Genius to send Gizmek Orochi from your deck to the gy. Now you have a link-2 and 2-4 bodies that can easily be used to synchro spam. In this combo you can do things like small world a Gizmek Naganaki/Arakami/Uka to your hand, and banish Naganaki from the gy to get yet another body on board.</p><p>But, this combo is now twice as consistent, and twice as powerful. It goes like this-</p><ol><li>Summon 2 machines for Qliphort Genius. Now, use either Urgent Schedule or Machine Duplication to summon 2 Earth machines to the arrows, allowing you to add Uka/Orochi/Kaku/Therion king regulus from your deck to your hand.</li><li>Use both monsters Genius points to to Link summon Ancient Gear Ballista, and add Ancient gear from your deck to your hand and special summon it. You can use cards like Tainguku to summon uka from your gy and give you another two bodies, and you allready have two bodies in your hand you can summon from your hand via their own effects. You can use things like Emergency teleport or Ukas effect to atart P.U.N.K comboing in addition, if you used Machine Duplication, you can start Telefon looping in addition. This combo pretty much has it all. Without Telefon you can still end up with 2 link 2 and up to 7 bodies for comboing.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>On it's own, this card negates hinderinces and let you combo under cards such as Skill drain, Gozen match, and Zombie world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>P.U.N.K Combos-</strong></p><p>PUNK help get cards to the gy for their gy effects, and can make a 1 card combo into a Zeus, or when in a combo, Can make Hope Harbinger and Zeus/Baronne:</p><ol><li>Normal summon Ze Amin or special summon it off of Gizmek Uka/Emergency Teleport.</li><li>Activate it's effect to add Foxy Tune.&nbsp;</li><li>Activate Foxy tunes effect to discard a card to summon Deer note(the discard can allow for effects like that of Clockwork Night or Gizmek Tainguku, and the summon can trigger Gizmek Uka,).</li><li>Use Deer note and Ze Amin to synchro summon JAM Dragon Drive. Then either;</li></ol><p>Use Deer note to revive Ze Amin, and use JAM to add and summon Psychic Wheeleder. Use both level 3s to xyz summon JaJa, and make Zeus after the battle phase.</p><p>Revive Foxy tune and if you add it to the deck, add Ghost Ogre to your hand, then use both level 8 to xyz summon Hope Harbinger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kaiju &amp; co.-</strong></p><p>Kaijus, Nibiru, Lava Golem, and Sphere mode are all famous for their role of tributing opponents monsters before they can react, easily wipung threats away like a speck of dust on the play mat. Sphere mode is the best of these cards for the current format, however this deck uses Kumongus the sticky string kaiju. Kaijus have different attributes, and allow you to control what you summon off of Gizmek Uka. Kumongus lets you summin cards like Telefon and Ze Amin off of uka. Where as all Spheres can get you is a self destructing Obelisk the Tormentor. So I prefer Kaijus, but it's up to your preference here. 3 monsters, or 1 monster and a combo. The different Kaijus have different summons you can gain off of them, for every kaiju, there is a Gizmek card that shares the attribute, excluding WIND. So any can be used. Being a level 7, if you manage to get a Kaiju to your field you can easily use it as Baronne material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clockwork Night-</strong></p><p>This card has a few uses, the first one being an OTK. Urgent Schedule lets you go into some insane combos, but, only machines can attack the turn you use it. The majority of your extra deck aren't machines. But, Clockwork night not only makes them machines, but gives them 500 extra ATK while making your opponent loose 500. This let's you attack over pretty much anything. The second use is it's search effect. After being sent to the gy via foxy tune/knightmare unicorn/ancient gear ballista, you can banish it to discard a card, and search an earth machine. Letting you gain gy effects of your Gizmeks and letting you add powerful cards like Therion King Regulus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cards to swap in</strong><strong>-</strong></p><p>1&times;Ghost Ogre: Ghost ogre can be searched by Dragon Drive.</p><p>1xMachina Citadel: a good main deck boss monster if you can get it to the gy, it can destroy itself to destroy all monsters with less that 3000ATK on the field, and whenever an earth machine you control is destroyed, it summons itself back to the field.</p><p>3&times; Cyber Dragon nachester/1&times;Chimeratech Fortress dragon: ockwork night makes all monsters machine, so if you have nachester on your field, you can use it and all of your opponents monsters as fusion material for chimeratech fortress dragon. However you can't search clockwork night so this was rather inconsistent and removed from the deck.</p><p>1&times;Scarlight red dragon archfiend: Scarlight can destroy all monsters with lower or equal ATK to it. Alongside Clockwork night, this card can wipe away a card that was once at 4000ATK,&nbsp; with Chengying, you can wipe away practically anything if enough cards are banished. Even better, Scarlight deals 500 damage for each card destroyed, dealing up to 5500 effect damage and 3000 battle damage all on its own in a full field.</p><p>Gizmek Inaba, the hopping hare of hakuto: More OTK stuff, you can banish this card from the gy to make a face up machine you control whos stats are balanced gain ATK equal to that of all other machines you control with balanced stats, but only it can attack this turn. Ancient gear balista can change an opponents ATK to 0, so in a Qliphort Genius combo, it's possible to give a single gizmek enough ATK to OTK.</p><p>Limiter removal: This card doubles all your machines ATK, but destroys them during the end phase. So another OTK card. Clockwork night makes Avramax a machine with 3500ATK, that gets doubled to 7000! 7500 if you count the fact that Clockwork night makes your opponent's monster loose 500ATK. Due to Avramax's effect, it will almost alwayse deal it's ATK stat as damage, meaning on its own this card will almost alwayse do 7500 damage in this scenario. Accesscode talker's ATK can shoot up as high as 11600!</p><p>Gizmek Scrolls: This field spell lets you look at the top 3 cards of your deck to add a machine with balanced stats to your hand,&nbsp; and banish the other two face down. It has an additional effect to where when you summon a monster with balanced stats 10 times, all monsters wothout balanced stats have their effects negated. This excludes link monsters.</p><p>Therion discollusseum: this field spell lets you add a Therion King regulus to your hand upon activation. It also gives you battle protection once per turn that lets you add another therion king regulus.</p><p>Brain research lab: normal summon P.U.N.K in addition to your normal summon/set.</p><p>Terraforming.</p><p>Iron call: monster reborn for level 4 and lower machines but their effects are negated.</p><p>Dimensional&nbsp; barrier: pick an extra deck mechanic, it doesn't exist this turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meta/Bad matchups &amp; how to counter it-</strong></p><p>Spright- pretty much lost their spark now but you still see them around. Use a negate on spright Blue/starter, silent graveyard stops frog shinanigans, and most of the time you should be able to combo around 2 or 3 negates.</p><p>Branded- you can outlast branded resource wise, if you need to, they honestly don't do alot other than banish a single card and change your ATK to zero, the occasional shrimp that can attack all your monsters. Other than that it's play around generic disruption as you usually would.</p><p>Exosister- step 1. Pray. Step 2. Kaiju. Exosister suck, this deck relies on it's gy alot so really you need a kaiju, or bait them while trying to make zeus so you can combo next turn when you get your gy back.</p><p>Tearalaments- The second threat, you have Silent gy to shut them entirely down if you draw it, you have your 7 disruption cards, your kaijus who don't help much as it triggers fusion summoning. Ojama trio helps too funnily enough, they only get 2 monster zones and an extra monster zone that way, which cuts how much they can fusion summon against you. If you manage to get a barrier statue out alongside Avramax, you can kill them as they won't be able to summon at all. So go first and pray for a decent hand.</p><p>Trap based decks- Just use red reboot. Oh wait, konami decided right now was a great time to ban it and give them a card that searches normal traps right after giving them a monster that searches continuous traps. You can use Cosmic cyclone to banish the troublesome ones, Ojama trio saves the day again as it stops eldilich from harassing you with trap monsters. Making therion king early in a turn can help a TON, but other than that you play like usual. Against cards like there can be only one and gozen match, Qliphort genius can negate them. In rare cases, you can make Genius under summon limit. Knightmare unicorn and I:P Masquerena are both different types from eachother and your machine based deck, allowing you to make unicorn under there can be only one to shuffle it back into the deck.</p><p>Mystic mine- banish it with cosmic space cyclone. Ojama trio can give your opponent 3 monsters, allowing you to compress your board into a knightmare unicorn so you can shuffle the mystic mine away, then set up negates to stop it from coming back out.</p><p>Zombie world &amp; co.- these cards change your typing from machine, wrecking your plays. Knightmare unicorn, cosmic space cyclone, qliphort genius, and clockwork night negate these kind of cards.&nbsp;</p><p>Kshatri-la- I haven't fought them, but they are going to be meta with that new support no doubt. Firstly, Gizmek has a strange archtype specific damage control. Kshatri la banish your cards face down, but Gizmek Naganaki can add a face down banished machine with balanced stats from banished face down to your hand. So that helps. This archtype has a variety of attributes, so barrier statue Avramax hits them hard. They are a somewhat combo deck so Ojama trio should help by filling monster zones, but you are a combo deck as well, so them negating your ability to use zones is just as impactful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for now, as always, hope you enjoy!</p>"

This build also includes new and better combos as well. For full comb,"For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on YouTube for more info.  This is an update to my U Link Code Talker Deck: https://ygoprodeck.com/the-u-link-code-talker-deck/ This build involves new cards that were added by the mod. It is much better than the older build and involves better combos. One thing that would make the deck much more consistent is the addition of 3 copies of Small World. Hope you enjoy this one.

The Magistus Engine makes this deck extremely viable.,"This IMO is the best version of a Pre-POTE Exosister deck! It's very consistent with the help of the Magistus Engine.  Since we don't have Malfa at the moment in the TCG and Master Duel, Zoroa will act as your Malfa. It can special summon a spellcaster monster from the hand or graveyard and Artemis can search another Zoroa for next turn! Also since it's a tuner and it can equip itself with a link, it's also a 1 card Borreload Savage Dragon!  You can also change Solemn Judgment to Solemn Strike or another playset of handtraps, but I prefer playing them to protect my field from going 2nd cards.  I've been getting alot of consistent wins and and even beaten toe-to-toe with the best decks in the game!"

In short, this deck wants to go first and setup a variety of different boards depending on the cards you open.

Very powerful in a casual format ,"White Aura Fish Synchro Combos:  This is a fish Synchro/Xyz spam combo deck that takes advantage of some of the insane generic water and fish support. It can do some crazy things facilitate floodgates, OTKs, and play through some disruptions. It can take advantage of a very large Sychro and Rank 4 Xyz pool. This mostly operates at a casual to low-rouge status. It won’t take any event tops, but could definitely steal some wins.  &nbsp;  This deck has a few combo/playlines that come up fairly frequently. The main goal is to spit out your giant boss monsters from the depths. If you are going first try and make Adamancipator Dragite, for the disruption and if your going second try and make White Aura Whale and Bihamut for a potential OTK. This deck can take advantage and make almost any synchro monster, using Magalancia you can alter the monster levels to make any synchro needed. This deck can also utilize some of the new support from the Duelist from the Deep Booster. This is probably one of my favorite decks ever, I love the idea of all of these ancient and powerful sea monsters rising up from the depths. It s a sold deck and can hold its own quite well in a more casual format.  &nbsp;  Combos and Tips: <ol>  	<li>Your main starters are Lifeless Leafish or Beatunaful Princess to SS Lealfish or Royal Swamp Eel from the deck. Use Leafishe’s foolish burial effect to dump usually Fishborg Launcher or Coelacanth any level 4 fish if you open White Mirror.</li>  	<li>The main tuners are Gluttonous Reptolphin Greethys, FIshborg Launcher, and Royal Swamp Eel. You will usually SS Swamp Eel from the deck or the GY. Greethys can SS a fish from the grave and gives his Synchro’d monster a nice attack boost, fishborg you want Foolished for his SS effect.</li>  	<li>White Mirror is an insane extender, it’s a +1. The main targets are Silent Angler or Greethys you can SS one from the grave to add the other to the hand you can then SS Silent Angler from the hand for 2 bodies on the field for any Xyz play.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Main Combos:  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li>Opening Hand: Greethys + Silent Angler- summon Greethys and SS Angler from the hand. Synchro for White Aura Monoceros, trigger his effect SS Greethys from GY. Use Greethys effect to SS Silent angler back from GY in def. Synchro Greehtys and Monoceros into Barrone de Fleur. Use Greethys effect to boost Fleurs attack to 4000.</li>  	<li>Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth: SS him from GY with Monster Reborn, White Aura Monoceros, Number 37, or Whitefish Salvage. Resolve his effect and SS from the deck Fishborg Launcher, Greethys, Friller Rabica, and any other lvl 4 non tuner. Use FIshborg and the Deepsea King to make Dragite or White Aura Whale, then Greethys and Rabica to make Coral Dragon to then Synchro with the lvl 4 into either White Aura Behaumut or Barrone de Fleur.</li> </ol>"

It's pretty fun and allows for alternate routes. Buster Dragon turns every monster on your opponents side into the Dragon typing which can be disruptive when they need to use specific monster types for extra deck plays. Exosisters are able to go into rank 4 monsters pretty quickly especially with the help of the familiars.  You can soft lock your opponent by just starting with a single Whelp. Simply normal summon Whelp search prologue and go into Almiraj. Use prologue on your opponents turn to target Memories and a Buster Blader to go into Buster Dragon. Then you banish Memories and use the Whelp from your first turn and the Blader to summon Dragon Destroyer.  With this, your opponents side is soft locked and they will have to spend resources to get rid of your field or end their turn if they are heavily relying on activated effects from monsters.  Still playing around with the build and changing it as I go."

I tuned the deck to be as consistent and as pure as possible, the classical ""floodgate gravekeeper"" uses too many handtraps, solemns etc. to be consistent (but it can actually work very well, see the side deck for some cards you might want to side in if a more floodgatey playstyle is needed). So lets look at the cards...</span>  <span><strong>Necrovalley (+ Terraforming, + Commandant, + Throne)</strong></span>  <span>The backbone of the whole archetype. Blocks cards in the GY from being banished, blocks any effect that would move a card from the GY to a different spot (e.g. <em>Monster Reborn</em>) and effects that would include changing types or attributes in the GY (e.g. <em>Zombie Worlds</em> first effect). This card is able to block a lot of plays and we need it to use the effect of <em>Spiritualist</em> for fusion summoning <em>Supernaturalist </em>(and then profiting from the destruction protection). Together with <em>Terraforming</em> and <em>Commandant</em> we practically play 7 versions of necrovalley and because we can search commandant with <em>Throne</em> we basically play 10 copies of necrovalley.</span>  <span><em>Necrovalley</em> also gives all Gravekeeper Monsters a 500 ATK/DEF bonus which makes them quite impressive beatsticks.</span>  <span><strong>Spiritualist (+ Polyermerization)</strong></span>  <span>The second most important part of our strategy. To fusion summon <em>Supernaturalist</em> (SN) we either need <em>Spiritualist</em> + <em>Necrovalley</em> (see Necrovalley) or we can directly use <em>Polyermization</em>. Personally I found only few builds that use the classical <em>Polymerization</em> but I found it to essential to increase the consistency and amount of options.</span>  <strong><span>Supernaturalist</span></strong>  <span>Our fusion summoned boss monster. Gains 100 ATK/DEF for each level used for the fusion summoning. Summoning with 2 lv 4s and <em>Necrovalley</em> on the field this already becomes a 3300 ATK and DEF beatstick. Protects itself and <em>Necrovalley</em> from destruction (as long as <em>Necrovalley</em> is on the field). Also gives the opportunity to search a 'Gravekeeper' monster or 'Necrovalley' card from the deck in the end phase (sadly the end phase, that could bring some really strong negates otherwise). You basically have 1 main go-to options here: search for <em>Throne</em> (most generic and strongest search card in the archetype). But you could also search for <em>Hidden Temples </em>or <em>Tomb of Necrovalley </em>as this either gives the option to completely lock out the opponent from special summoning monsters or gives you another negate - but the consistency might be weakened if your opponent is able to break 'your board'.</span>  <span>Another option is to search for <em>Headman</em> if you have <em>Spiritualist</em> in the GY: this allows you to special summon her to the field and fusion summon another <em>Supernaturalist</em>.</span>  <strong><span>Necrovalley Throne (+ Allure of Darkness, + Upstart Goblin, + Pot of Desires, + Stele)</span></strong>  <span>Throne basically lets you search any <em>Gravekeeper</em> monster, in most cases you are either searching <em>Spiritualist</em> or <em>Commandant</em> (the latter to get access to <em>Necrovalley</em>). The second effect is in my experience rarely the right choice, but the side deck contains some Rank 3 and Rank 4 xyz that might be an out in some situations.</span>  <span>We also play <em>Allure</em>, <em>Upstart</em> and <em>Desires</em> just to boost our consistency. These cards are essential to get to the cards we want and really need. Also we dont play <em>Demise</em> because we want to turbo out <em>Supernaturalist</em>. Beyond that, <em>Gravekeeper's Stele </em>allows us to add 2<em> Gravekeeper </em>monsters to our hand from the GY (ignoring <em>Necrovalley</em>) and is together with <em>Headman</em> our only way to recycle ressources.</span>  <strong><span>Other Gravekeepers</span></strong>  <em>Spy</em> is a strong card with a lot of defense especially if necrovalley is on the field, we can summon <em>Spirtiualist</em> (if there are not attacks left) or <em>Recruiter</em> (for another search if destroyed). <em>Guard</em> is basically only here so we can use non-destruction removal if needed and Descendant if we really need to get rid of a card. <em>Headman</em> can be used to special summon a lvl 4 monster from the GY (sadly <em>Headman</em> is lv 3 otherwise this would be really good opportunity for an xyz summon), main play here is to ressurrect <em>Spirutualist</em> and fusion summon again.  In general the ration of <em>Descendant</em>, <em>Recruiter </em>and <em>Guard</em>  doesnt matter too much, they can be tech cards, but mainly we need some monsters for fusion summoning. Sadly I was not really able to get other Gravekeepers cards in here really, most of them are sadly just too bad.  <strong><span>Tech Cards (+ Extra Deck)</span></strong>  <span>We play the Dark Kaiju <em>Radian</em> (to allow usage of  <em>Allure</em>) and a copy of <em>Rite of Spirit </em>which might help to recover a destroyed <em>Supernaturalist</em> or to further stall the opponent. We play a <em>Starving Venom</em> if we have poly + Kaiju + 1 Dark in our hand, just so we are not stuck doing nothing. The other extra deck cards are just some generic rank3/rank4s  that might come up handy, a really nice tech card is <strong>Akashic magician</strong> that gives a really nice option for non-destruction removal.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The fusions themselves are not incredibly impressive, though with the help of Instant/Ready Fusion, Mobile Base should be easy to get out.  However, while the deck CAN do fusions, it mostly specializes in searching for Expressroid and Ambulanceroid to swam the field with roid monsters and get cool link plays. Dragonroid, Gear Gigant X, Pot of Prosperity and Megaroid City help you find them, while the Gadgets get you started, and Platinum is usually how you'll end up getting Expressroid onto the field for its effect.  Emergeroid Call is tempting as an omni-negate, but it's also just another card that returns a roid from grave to hand, which in this case means Special Summon if you have Ambulanceroid out.  Still trying to get the deck as consistent as possible, and while it can't really fit handtraps with this mix of fusion and link summoning, you can theoretically make a much more skim list with only the link aspects and actually have hand traps for interruptions."

In Virtual World, we can use this level 6 synchro tuner to send eldlich to the GY, thus making Immortal Dragon a level 4 tuner. This allows you to end on boards with Eldlich at 3500 ATK alongside Chengying (or Barronne). Other great features include using Muddragon to get to Mirrorjade, and a tiny PUNK engine to help add negates to your board. This build is sure to turn heads at your next locals!"

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendelum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a &lt;#907791420469956678&gt; You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

I'll use this space to go over a few key choices I made for the WCQ, some tricks people may not know, and my match history.  &nbsp;  <strong>40 Card Main Deck:</strong>  One thing I was certain of this meta is that I had to be on 40 cards and it was not optional. This is because many matchups in the format are NOT WINNABLE without seeing side cards. Scythe locks, floodgates, giant boards, and cards like Zombie World are everywhere this format. Often times, drawing just engine makes the game impossible to win. I kept my deck to 40 specifically to increase my chances of drawing side cards. Both for going first and for going second. This paid off immensely today as the majority of my games I opened a blow out side card in backrow removal or something like anti-spell. Some of my ratios are a little weird because of this with things like Adhara at 2, but it was more than worth it.  <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird:</strong>  I respect the Floowandereeze matchups a lot more than I feel other players do. If you are going second, it is almost impossible to win without seeing a side card. This is one of the reasons I main decked droll over Nibiru. This format Swordsoul plays exceedingly well into weaker boards. Often clearing the board as part of their normal combo for setup through Baxia combo lines. I am not a huge fan of Nibiru turning off your Tenyis and Droll was an excellent substitute. Every game I drew Droll, even in multiples, I won the game. Would highly recommend trying it out for those who haven't.  &nbsp;  <strong>Heavenly Dragon Circle vs Vessel:</strong>  I play 3 circle and no vessel for my spell ratios. In my own experience, I dislike vessel alot as its only great when you open it with another Tenyi. Past that its only hand advantage and doesn't contribute to the board if you have to use it after making a token. Swordsoul boards are often fairly weak and getting otk'd before you can use your resources is a major problem. I play 3 circle for a few reasons. <ol>  	<li>Circle is effectively Crossout Designator. Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence are the 2nd and 3rd most popular handtraps behind Ash Blossom in every deck right now. Circle was a card I wanted to see in my opener every game (played 3) as it would protect my normal summon. This came up so often and completely saved me at least 5 times throughout the tournament.</li>  	<li>Second is the fact that it can turn any Tenyi into any Swordsoul. When doing your Chixiao search, you often have to decide between searching Longyuan and Blackout. With circle, you can special a Tenyi, and use it to search your starter, or a Longyuan so you can get Blackout later. This further increases the consistency of the deck as you have 14 ways of getting to your normal summon.</li>  	<li>Circle is a main deck out for Mystic Mine. In the months since the latest banlist. I looked back at my games and the majority of my losses were either to a trap floodgate, Artifact Scythe, or Mystic Mine. With circle you can tribute summon a lvl  7 Tenyi over your board and tribute it off with circle to out Mystic Mine. You can either do this on your own turn to guarantee Mystic Mine being destroyed, or you can tribute set a Tenyi over your board and set circle. During their End Phase you can tribute your monster with Circle and catch them by surprise.</li>  	<li>Many people dislike circle as many times you don't use it and they see it as a minus 1. Often times this isn't quite the case. If you have circle and go through your turn without using it, then you didn't need it. You must already be in a winning position and it didn't need to resolve in the first place. In these scenarios I set the card before passing the turn. You can combo Circle with Blackout as a cl2 to tribute your Blackout target and get your search. Furthermore, you can tribute your Wyrm on field when do a removal effect. Many times I would tribute off my own Chixiao or Monk in the End Phase to search a starter for the next turn. Then on my own turn I could use the second effect to add a Tenyi to discard for Longyuan. Furthermore, this would be a Vishuda to remove problems, or Ashuna, to get extra bodies on board for lethal.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong>Forbidden Chalice vs Forbidden Droplet:</strong>  I chose to run Chalice over Droplet today primarily because I was main decking Droll &amp; Lock Bird. Many  times there is a single card on the board that is stopping your turns from going smoothly (Barrier Statue, Rexterm, Standard Boss Monsters). I found I didn't need the extra punch that Droplet provided and allowed me to keep more of my hand in the process. Furthermore, I don't play many spells in which to combo Droplets with as it was often the only spell I drew for turn. Finally, I found my biggest issue was token collector, and just having a quick 1-for-1 to deal with it instead of a 2-for-1 in Droplets was better for me. I am also siding DRNM to deal with the board breaking issue.  &nbsp;  <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma:</strong>  I have run Final Sigma over Dragite for many months for a few reasons. The first is decks like Floowandereeze and Sky Striker. These are decks that not only need to setup, but also overcommit to beating Final Sigma. Some Floowandereeze players do not run the Extra Deck outs as there is not a single card in their main deck which beats it. This came up round 6 when I played against the Floowandereeze player who won the tournament. He used Dimension Shifter in SP and I immediately made Chixiao and used its effect to banish Blackout from deck instead of searching to make Final Sigma. It took him 4 turns to eventually waste his turn outing the card and by then I had built up enough cards in hand to easily OTKand beat him 2-0. In these matchups, Final Sigma often serves as a pseudo Mystic Mine. Against Sky Striker their only out is Accesscode Talker. If you save a monster negate, when they gain the attack, on resolution you can negate Accesscode and it loses the attack and they no longer have a way to beat it. Finally, many times on turn 3 you do a Baxia line with Taia that often banishes Blackout in the process. You have an extra token and I use Baxia and that token to make Final Sigma to OTK since it deals double damage through monsters. This comes up very often.  &nbsp;  <strong>Important Tricks:</strong>  <strong>Outing Gozen Match: </strong>  There is one specific hand going first that can beat this card. Say you Special Summon Vishuda to the board and they flip Gozen Match. You can use Heavenly Dragon Circle to tribute Vishuda off and search Adhara. You can then SS Adhara and make Monk as they are both earth. From here if you have Vishuda in Graveyard or in hand you can bounce Gozen.  &nbsp;  <strong>Outing Necroworld Banshee and Baiting with Tenyis from Hand: </strong>  In my round 3 I won game 1 by doing the following line: My oponent ended their turn with a Banshee face up on the field. For those that don't know, they can banish Banshee as a quick effect to put Zombie World on the field which is a huge lock for us. In this game I SS Vishuda first and linked it off for Monk. I then normal summoned Taia and banished Vishuda. My opponent seeing that the threat was gone and that I could synchro summon used Banshee to put Zombie World in play. I then activated adhara from hand to add the banished Vishuda back to hand and use its effect in hand to bounce the Zombie world and win that game. It is very important to be aware of when you can activate Tenyis from hand when your opponent isn't expecting it. In this scenario he could have stopped my play with Huaquero but held it as I was removing my own threat. A few other times I drew Shthana and stopped my opponent from OTK'ing me by leaving a monk on field and using Shthana to disrupt their Battle Phase.  &nbsp;  The best tip I have besides the first two is take things very slowly. Often times you can sneak a Tenyi on board or get an additional card in hand if you fully think out your plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>Match History (going 1st/2nd)</strong>  Adamancipator: 2-0 (1st)  Trap Eldlich: 2-0 (2nd)  Trap Eldlich: 2-0 (2nd)  Swordsoul: 2-1 (2nd)  Swordsoul: 2-1 (2nd)  Floowandereeze: 2-0 (1st, first place finisher)  Dragon-Link: 1-2 (1st)  Punk Pendulum: 2-1 (1st)  Punk Synchro: 2-0 (1st)  I personally wouldn't change anything about the main deck as I never lost game 1 the entire day. If you have any questions or just want to talk theory feel free to reach out to me and best of luck with your own lists!"
