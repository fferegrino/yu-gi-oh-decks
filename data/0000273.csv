But that doesn't mean we don't want it-","<strong>Bread and Butter Combos:</strong>  Delta The Magnet Warrior + Magnetic Field + Magnet Induction  Activate Magnetic Field, leave your opponent in a state of chronic shock as they realize they're playing against Magnet Warriors, then Normal Summon Delta. Use Delta The Magnet Warrior's effect to send Beta The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck to Grave, then activate Magnet Induction to Special Summon Epsilon The Magnet Warrior from Deck. Use Epsilon's effect to trade out the Beta The Electromagnet Warrior in grave by milling a Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck, then add Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck to hand with Beta. Use Magnetic Field to bring back Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior from grave to Special Summon Alpha from hand, and add a Level 8 Magna Warrior (preferably Berserkion since you can summon Valkyrion from Deck). If going first, make Gallant Granite and Gorgonic Guardian. Use Gallant Granite to search Adamancipator Researcher to get another body on board, then use Adamanciaptor Researcher and the remaining Level 3 to make a Naturia Beast. If going second, make Gallant Granite (or Number 101: Silent Honor ARK) and The Phantom Knights of Break Sword and use Gallant to add an Adamancipator Researcher OR another Magna Warrior. It doesn't take much thought to go on from there.  (You can tell from this upcoming combo that I play this Deck more than I should.)  Beta The Electromagnet Warrior + Magnetic Field + Magnet Induction  Activate Magnetic Field, panic because you really hope your opponent doesn't have a hand trap, then Normal Summon Beta The Electromagnet Warrior. Use Beta The Electromagnet Warrior's effect to add Delta The Magnet Warrior from Deck to hand, then activate Magnet Induction to Special Summon Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior from Deck.  Use Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior's effect to summon the Delta from hand, and mill an Epsilon. Now your first instinct, especially when playing on a simulator (because let's be real, who would spend $95+ on a Magnet Warrior Deck?) is to immediately activate Magnetic Field to Special Summon Epsilon and mill an Alpha, then immediately forfeit because you realized how stupid that was. Instead, hold back from using field for a bit, and make Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss (SYNERGYYYYY). Use its effect to mill and Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior and get an insignificant 2200 ATK. NOW you use Magnetic Field to Special Summon Epsilon The Magnet Warrior from grave, which then mills any Magnet Warrior except an Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior, to Special Summon the milled Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior. Use its effect to add a Level 8 Magna Warrior, and well, you know the procedure when you've got 2 Level 4s out.  <strong>Overview of the Deck:</strong>  Magnet Warriors are an interesting bunch. Lots of people complain that they don't do much by themselves and need lots of support to even be playable (not that new support is unwelcome, please give us the rest of the Magnets, Konami), and while that's true, this has always been the design of Magnet Warriors. From day 1, Valkyrion's design implicates that the main function of Magnets was for being a Tribute engine to turbo out high level monsters like the god cards (which wasn't practical, but hey it's something). Their continued support has simply allowed them to adapt, and enhanced their ability to support other strategies even more. Now, whether or not this design choice was a good one is up for a debate that I could honestly care less about. What is a fact though, is that Magnet Warriors have a degree of splashability and weird field interactions that give them a variety of play styles, and always leaves them open for experimentation. More credit than what people give them.  <em>Either that or I'm just mad that Block Dragon's still banned, and am resorting to a 3 card combo to search Researcher.</em>"

You can <ul>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> <ul>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Curse of Dragon</strong> from hand or GY, <ul>  	<li>Pick up <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> (this can get Ash blossomed) and fusion summon Gaia Magical Knight of Dragons</li>  	<li>Or pick up <strong>Galloping Gaia</strong> (usually if you already have Spiral fusion in your hand)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Normal summon <strong>Artillery Catapult Turtle</strong> <ul>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong> from the deck (this can get Ash blossomed) <ul>  	<li>Then follow through first steps.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Special summon <strong>Curse of Dragon</strong> <ul>  	<li>Then pick up either <strong>Spiral Fusion</strong> if you can use it, or get <strong>Galloping Gaia</strong></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> With Spiral Fusion, your fusion Gaia gains 2600 ATK, and is allowed to attack twice on monsters.  <strong>Gaia Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> is the safest, and strongest card you can play on turn one as it can decrease its ATK by 2600 to destroy one card on the field once per any turn, but <strong>NOT</strong> negate. This card is the go to for fusion summoning cause of its effect to gain 2600 ATK after killing a monster in battle, once per battle phase. Becomes ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" on the field.  <strong>Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion</strong> is situational as he can force the monster he's attacking to attack or defense position. His summon searches <em>Spiral Spear Strike</em> from the deck or GY, which allows ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" pierce dmg on defense position monsters. It allows you to draw 2, discard 1, if you are able to destroy the monster. Becomes ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" on the field. (You can Fusion summon this card using <strong>Keeper of Dragon Magic</strong> as material)  <strong>Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</strong>, is a super situational card. Once fusion summoned, you can fusion summon a level 7 dragon fusion monster using materials in the GY, and pull out Spiral Fusion out of your GY to fusion summon any of the fusion Gaia's above.  <strong>Soldier Gaia the Fierce Knight</strong> quick effect is to tribute a fusion dragon monster to summon this dude. This effect can be used in battle phase and can attack as well when summoned, so attack after the monster has attacked.  When Fusion summoning with Curse of Dragon, it can activate another effect by targeting your ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" and negating all your opponents face up monsters effects with ATK less than or equal to that Gaia.  <strong>IF an open board, no cards on opponent side, 8k LP</strong> <ol>  	<li>Fusion summon Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</li>  	<li>Fusion summon any ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" cards</li>  	<li>Go to ""Battle Phase""</li>  	<li>Attack on each monster, then use Soldier Gaia the Fierce Knight quick effect to summon himself using Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon</li>  	<li><strong>DON'T </strong>use his effect once summoned.</li>  	<li>The DMG should come out to 2k + 5.2k + 2.6k = 9.2k</li> </ol> You usually don't have to worry about traps in the battle phase because of Galloping Gaia's effect, if you have any ""Gaia the Dragon Champion"" fusion cards on the field.  When using <strong>Galloping Gaia</strong>, you want to pick up <strong>Curse of Dragon</strong>, or <strong>Gaia the Magical Knight</strong>. These two cards are the engine of this deck.  You can fusion summon with any of the Gaia the Fierce Knight, and ANY level 5 dragon monster. <strong>Mahaama dragon</strong> is in this deck incase you have absolutely nothing and can help stall a bit.  IF <strong>Gaia the Fierce Knight Origins</strong> is in the GY, you can change one monster's ATK to the original value. You DON'T use this on your Gaia's unless you happen to have your <strong>Gaia Magical Knight of Dragons</strong> ATK to be at Zero for some reason.  <em>Spiral Spear Strike</em>. This is a dead card in most cases on your starting hand. You only want this if the enemy has a defense monster. *It's okay to throw this card away since <strong>Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion </strong>can pick it up from the GY or deck.  &nbsp;  Feel free to add more to the extra deck. This was just basically a pure Gaia fusion deck and it's fun seeing a 5.2k beater on the board destroying monsters on the field."

Starters are Rescue Cat, Nimble Beaver, and Obedience Schooled. Ideally you end on a Naturia Beast + Joyous Melffys with a Kalantosa under it, giving you unlimited spell negates and a pop + another card, ideally Puppy or Wallaby, and you also then have the potential to go Sealy + 2* into Cheerful or Herald, or Sealy + 4* into Desert Locusts, ripping a card, then Locusts +4* into Leo for a big dude to sit on. Joyous Melffys is here if you don't have anything else turn 1, Mommy can do some fun stuff with 5 materials but really is cope, Crumble Logos can get something annoying out of the way, Barkion and Landoise for specific matchups where trap or monster negates are more useful, Dawn Dragster for a negate to summon on your opponent's turn with Sealy, since Naturia Beast requires an Earth tuner, Cross-Sheep to play around Knightmare Gryphon, although that's really just my casual environment talking, and Saryuja for additional summons and to make use of a swarmed board.  In the side I just threw a bunch of random stuff without much thought, but there's the other two Alphas for going second, 3 Lost Wind for more negates, 1 Obelisk because it's hilarious, a Knightmare package just for fun, 3 Drowning just because, and a little Fabled package because Unicore is kinda nice, and Cerburrel isn't terrible."

Forget expensive staples/techs and control the battlefield with powerful Gladiator Beast Fusions ,"Unleash the beast with Gladiator Beasts on a budget! The aim of the game is summoning Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor, and there are multiple ways to do this.  [Before talking strategy, I'd like to get this out of the way first: This is by no means an optimal build, missing most pricey staples/techs currently available in the modern TCG. Funny enough, after not having played the TCG for maybe a decade, I had finally gotten around to selling my entire collection (except for my GBs and a few staples for nostalgia's sake) last year, but the successful marketing campaign that is Master Duel (and my success in Platinum Ranked using GBs with their new support) rekindled the heart of the cards in me. However, I was not looking to start throwing large sums of money at the TCG,  Therefore, no single card in the deck is valued above $6, and almost 80% of all cards used are below $2.]  Disclaimer now out of the way, let's talk about Tamer Editor. This fantastic fusion monster, requiring 2 LV5+ GBs, has a *soft* 1/turn effect to summon any GB fusion monster from the ED, allowing you to quickly stack your field with big bodies that can either pop or negate your opponent's cards. The particularly helpful part of this effect is being able to summon Dominitianus and Heraklinos without the need for 3 GBs. In fact, the deck doesn't even run Vespasius or Laquari, the GBs normally needed to summon them, freeing up space in the deck for more cards that add support or consistency to achieving our main goal of summoning Tamer Editor.  You'll normally summon Tamer Editor with Augustus (field) + Augustus/Noxious/Attorix, but Augustus + Attorix is by far the easiest way, Attorix being searchable with Test Panther (2), Tenki (1), Proving Ground (3), and Rejection (3). The Tamer Editor flowchart normally starts with a field consisting of Test Panther and any GB (except for Augustus), and x1 Augustus/Noxious/Attorix in hand, though it can be done without Panther if you draw into Test Tiger.  STEP 1 The many ways to summon Test Panther + 1 GB: - Rescue Cat/Rabbit: Summon Samnite+TestTiger or x2 Andal, link into Test Panther, Panther searches GB Comeback to summon any non-Beast GB from hand or GY (non-Beast because Comeback can only summon a GB of a type not already face-up on your field, and Panther is a Beast, so make sure if you use Samnite that you have a different GB in hand). - Rescue Cat + Rescue Rabbit: SUMMON CAT FIRST, summon Ferrijit with Samnite+TT, Ferrijit summons Rabbit into Andal x2, 1st Andal+Ferrijit summons Test Panther alongside the 2nd Andal. - Andal x2 (inhand): 1st Andal links into Link Spider, Spider summons 2nd Andal from hand, link to Test Panther, search Comeback to revive Andal. - Unexpected Dai + Andal (in hand): Achieves the previous option before even normal summoning, allowing you to normal summon a GB alongside your Panther and save Comeback for a follow-up play, or search GB Charge/WarChariot/United for defense, or search Augustus/Noxious/Attorix if you don't have a LV5+ GB in hand (normally you'll want either Noxious/Attorix, but Augustus in hand can extend plays even further if you have Darius/Equeste/Bestiari in hand). - Mind Control + 1 GB: Steals an opponent's monster to use alongside 1 GB to summon Test Panther, since Panther is a Link2 requiring min. 1 GB. Panther searches Comeback, revives your GB. - Gladiator Rejection + RescueCat/RescueRabbit/UnexpectedDai/TestTiger+1GB: Free summon of an additional GB from deck whose type isn't face-up on your field when resolving when a GB is summoned from deck, and the main deck contains 11 cards that facilitate this alongside Rejection, in additional to GB tag-in/out effects (but the aim is to be able to summon Tamer Editor BEFORE the battle phase whenever possible). - Any 2 GB + Comeback: Summon 1st GB, Comeback summons 2nd GB, link into Panther, searches 2nd Comeback to revive either GB.  STEP 2 Use Panther + 1 GB on field and Augustus/Noxious/Attorix in hand to summon Tamer Editor: - Attorix/Tenki/ProvingGround: Draw or search Atttorix, Panther tags out the GB on field to summon Augustus from deck, summoning Attorix from hand, Attorix sends Augustus/Noxious from deck to GY to gain their LV, fuse Augustus+Attorix into Tamer Editor. - Noxious: Panther tags out the GB on field to summon Augustus from deck, summoning Noxious from hand, Noxious sends Bestiari from deck to GY (for follow-up Gyzarus plays using Darius/GBUnited), fuse Augustus+Noxious into Tamer Editor. - Augustus: Panther tags out the GB on field to summon Augustus from deck, summoning a 2nd Augustus from hand, fuse Augustus+Augustus into Tamer Editor. If you have another GB in hand, you can use the 2nd Augustus to summon it, potentially extending your combo (Darius to revive a GB, Equeste to recover Comeback, Bestiari to pop a S/T and/or fuse into Gyzarus for more pops). - Test Panther: Searches Augustus/Noxious/Attorix if you don't have it in hand by drawing or other means and already have Panther + 1 GB on field without the need to search Comeback.  STEP 3 Use Tamer Editor's effect: - Summon Domitianus: This is almost always your #1 pick. Soft 1/turn monster effect negate+destroy, PLUS you choose your opponent's attack targets on their Battle Phase, a useful effect used to protect your weaker cards like Panther. So many players DON'T READ this part of Domi's effects, leading them to accidentally attacking into your heavy hitters instead. #imagineduelistsactuallyreadingcardeffects - Summon Heraklinos: Can discard 1 to negate+destroy any S/T. Only summon with min. 1 card in hand. Remember that Darius/Equeste can help recycle your discarded GB cards (Remember that Equeste CANNOT recover Proving Ground or Rejection). Great for protecting your monsters from stuff like Raigeki / Lightning Storm or backrow-heavy decks in general. - Summon Gyzarus: A free pop 2 anywhere on the field. Great for dealing with high ATK targets, or pesky backrow.  Congrats! You now likely have a field of Test Panther, Tamer Editor and Domitianus. But why stop there? If you managed to conserve your GB Comeback, Link Tamer Editor and Test Panther into any Link 2 or 3, revive Tamer Editor with Comeback and activate its effect again, summoning either a 2nd Domi for more effect negation, Heraklinos to also gain protection from S/T, or Gyzarus to pop and clear the way to victory. Domitianus (3500) + Tamer Editor (2400) + Gyzarus (2400) = 8300 damage. That's lethal without even taking into account the ATK power of the Link Monster.  STEP 4 (optional) Link summon using Tamer Editor + Test Panther, revive Tamer Editor with Comeback to use its effect a 2nd time on the same turn: - Knightmare Unicorn: Your only way of non-destruction removal in the deck besides Tri-Brigade Shuraig. Alongside Gyzarus summoned by your revived Tamer Editor, you can remove up to 3 obstacles in your way before the Battle Phase. Up to 4, technically, since you can further Link Summon with Tamer Editor + Unicorn into Shuraig for a 1/turn non-targetting banish. Borrelsword Dragon is also a viable candidate for running over opposing heavy hitters. - Cross-Sheep/Ferrijit: These let you summon an extra monster from hand (Ferrijit) or GY (Cross-Sheep). If using Cross-Sheep, make sure you can summon Tamer Editor from GY to a zone Cross-Sheep points to to get its effect off. From here, you can further Link Summon with Tamer Editor + CrossSheep/Ferrijit + the extra monster into either Tri-Brigade Shuraig or Borrelsword Dragon. Borrelsword is usually for Turn 1 plays, to add an additional layer of defense to your field. Summoning Shuraig Turn 1 is not recommended, as you may lose it before ever getting to use its removal effect.  Notes on other main deck cards: - Gladiator Beast United: This searchable quickplay spell requires a bit of set-up, but is a great way to disrupt your opponent's plays on their turn. With Bestiari in hand, field or GY (usually put in GY by Noxious) and any other 1 GB in hand, field or GY, you can summon Gyzarus and pop 2. If you already have Bestiari + 1 GB + United on Turn 2 going 2nd, you can simply enter BP and summon Gyzarus to clear your opponent's field and attack, tagging out into setting up your Tamer Editor combo in MP2. - Gladiator Beast Charge: Effectively Gyzarus in searchable trap form. Lets you pop up to 1/GB with different names face-up on your field. - Gladiator Beast War Chariot: Searchable monster effect negation, for when Domitianus isn't enough. - Effect Veiler: Probably one of the best cheap hand traps. Interchangeable with Kaijus or other available had traps like Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit. However, Veiler (and other monster HTs like Ghost Ogre) has the added bonus of being able to normal summon it alongside a special summoned GB to go into Test Panther if necessary.  Side Deck: - Skull Meister and GB Retiari: For GY-heavy decks. - Gameciel: The Kaiju of choice, being the only one Tamer Editor and Gyzarus can run over. - Dimensional Barrier: For shutting down decks that focus heavily on ED monsters, especially those that use mostly a single type. - Royal Decree: For those nasty trap-heavy decks and Skill Drain. The deck doesn't really suffer by removing its 2 GB traps. - GB Charge: For decks that use a lot of continuous S/T, and an alternative out to Skill Drain. Looking at you, Eldlich players.  Other decent+cheap side deck options: - Twister / Twin Twister: For more S/T removal. Twister only works for face-up S/T but doesn't require a discard. You want your hand for Heraklinos and Unicorn, but remember you can recycle with Equeste. - Ghost Belle &amp; Snow Rabbit: Generic hand-trap destruction effect. Potential alternative to Veiler. - Dark Ruler No More: Another out to problematic monsters that are indestructible or have negation effects. Potential alternative to Gameciel.  Fun fact about GBs and Skill Drain interractions: - You can still tag in/out a GB under Skill Drain, because returning to deck is the cost, but the summoned GB will obviously not get its effect.  Main deck card options for those with a bigger budget or who already have some modern staples/techs: - Evenly Matched:  I love using this card in Master Duel with GBs. Summon a GB, attack, tag out (returns GB to deck as cost), chain link 2 Evenly Match, wipe your opponent's field, tag in to new GB. Fun fact about GB Comeback, the monster summoned by it is indestructible by battle, which is helpful if you have EM and a GB that can't attack over anything on your opponent's field. - Accesscode Talker: Another great finisher with high attack and a removal effect. Would probably replace Shuraig or Borrelsword (should probably keep for Turn 1 plays) with it. - Obviously stuff like Ash Blossom, Nibiru, Crossout, Droplets, Impermanence, etc.  Final Notes: This deck is a lot of fun and surprisingly consistent. Great for casual play with friends, or catching players off-guard at locals, but likely not big-tournament viable. Still, a great option for nostalgic players returning to the game on a budget."

This deck uses a combination of Stratos and Shadow mist's searching abilities in combination with the Vision HERO summoning engine to consistently build a board of monsters capable of OTKing. There is a bit of a learning curve however, the combos are situational and you need to adapt to your available cards. Expect to get pushed around a little as you learn the strategy and logic of this deck, but once mastered you'll be dunking on opponents in style.  Generally with this deck you want to go second. The deck doesn't have many options to defend itself aside from forbidden droplet and ash blossom, so going second allows you to generate your full field and immediately go for the kill instead of hoping your board survives the opponent's turn. Typically if you do go first the goal is to get Dark law or Plasma on the field as having those cards on the field can really disrupt your opponent, and almost guarantee a win if they can't clear them. This deck does not like extended duels and uses most of its resources in a large wombo combo. Generally speaking if after turn two you haven't done enough damage to cripple their game plan/win, most competent decks will out scale HEROs later into the duel.  Stratos/Shadow mist: Most of your searching power comes from these two cards, Getting their effects off successfully generally allows you to start your major combos. Shadow mist is an excellent target for effects like Vyon, Faris, Increase, and foolish burial, netting you a free hero search. Stratos can be used to clear spell/traps in a pinch.  Faris(Vision engine): Getting Faris to your hand allows you to kickstart your bnb, his discard effect can be used to get cards like malicious and shadow mist out of your hand(where they don't do much) into the graveyard. Then allows you to special summon  itself, and send Increase to your spell/trap zones. Tributing Faris(or a different monster) with Increase allows you to get an extra summon of Vyon who lets you discard from the deck. This one combo gets you two monsters on the field and allows you to discard from your hand and deck which is pretty nice.  Vyon: Has an effect that lets you send a card from the deck to the graveyard, and search for polymerization. Because of the amount of monsters the vision engine usually lets you summon, it's very easy to get Trinity on the field with Vyon.  Malicious: Malicious is another excellent target for cards you want to send to the grave, his effect allows you to special summon himself from the main deck by banishing himself from the grave. A free summon that can be used for links and combos very nicely with cards like fusion destiny, and Xtra HERO Cross Crusader. Worth noting that if you use Malicious to link summon Cross, you can bring him back using Cross' effect then link into Dread Decimator. Giving you a relatively cheap way to bring out one of your ideal OTK beat sticks.  Adusted Gold: Straightforward combo here. Discard Gold to get dark calling, use dark calling to fuse him from the grave with Dynatag or Malicious to get Malicious Edge, a board clearing 3k beat stick that generally ends most duels.  Liquid: Liquid soldier's effect allows you to draw 2 discard 1 if you use him in a fusion summon. Needless to say this is very helpful, and Absolute Zero (who is the typical target to fuse liquid into) can be mask changed into Acid for a full board wipe combo.  Mask Change: Mask change gives you access to some nice utility effects and is one of the more vital spells in the deck. Defensively you can use it to save a hero from being destroyed via card effect by using it to summon a masked hero before it's destroyed. Offensively it can be used during the battle phase on a monster that's already attacked to net you an extra attack thats between 2200-2800 dmg. In addition to that Blast and Acid have some helpful effects like clearing spells/traps and lowering attack points of opponent monsters. Not to mention Dark Law has one of the best effects in the game, neutering decks that rely on the graveyard and banishing cards from your opponents hand.

Aromage Laurel is an important combo card to trigger jasmine search, so prioritize searching it first if its not in your hand.

He makes the end board I respect most in current yugioh: <strong>distributed interactions</strong> whether field monster effect, spell/trap and hand traps. This type of combo is <strong>much better than decks that go to a table full of negates and lose to blind second cards</strong>. That's why I consider this a deck with immense potential for excellence in distributing interactions and this will be clear to everyone when <a data-name=""Mathmech Circular"">Mathmech Circular</a> support is released, which in my initial tests <strong>solves all of the deck's shortcomings</strong>. I tested Mathmech a lot in the current Tcg format and the deck performed very well, even with the powercreep of Token and DPE engines. This is due to a lot to understand that even with a lot of 1 Card Combo absurdities in the format the use of a lot of <strong>hand trap is still the best way to face everything unfair in the game</strong>, even if it doesn't completely stop the opponent it sure makes your end board breakable. With that in mind, I'll show you what I learned about the Mathmech archetype:  - Like every Cyberse deck it has a tight Extra Deck but it <strong>makes one of the best end boards among Cyberse decks in terms of interactions</strong> since <a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a> is an absurd card that is <strong>guaranteed at least -3 to the opponent</strong> since when it enters field it has an effect similar to <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> sending a card from the hand, a monster and a spell/trap to the GY in addition to the <strong>Omni Negate that gains</strong> from the <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> to deal with another card. - And if the hand is very good, you will have the interaction of <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> who turns <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> to deal with another opponent's card, not to mention the interactions in the form of <strong>hand traps and the OTK facility of Mathmech</strong>. - The deck ceiling is not very high so you have to make the most of every interaction you do which requires a lot of training and knowledge of competitive matchups.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //////////////////////////<strong>Combos</strong>: So as you can see your turn 1 has the objective of setting up <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> by making <a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a> on the opponent's turn using <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> as material to have an Omni Negate as well. For this you use an engine that became popular recently in the so-called ""<strong>Eldlich Cyberse</strong>"" but which has always been used in Mathmech: <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> + <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a>. Here you use this engine exclusively to access combos involving <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> which is a card that is only missing by ""Mathmech"" in the name because it <strong>connects several parts of the engine by adding one of its 3 Tuners</strong> from the deck to the hand: <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a>, <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> or <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a>. And to complement the archetype we have two <strong>great generic Cyberse support</strong> options in the Main Deck: <a data-name=""Balancer Lord"">Balancer Lord</a> and <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>. These cards make the deck's consistency much better as they <strong>increase the amount of 2 combo cards possible</strong> and even help when you need to build a field going second while dealing with opponent interactions. Finally, I demonstrate this whole theory below:  /////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Balancer Lord + Diameter</strong>  NS Balancer Lord and eff pay1000LP and Link Disciple NS Diameter and eff Reborn Balancer Lord and RANK-4 Alembertian and eff Add Superfactorial *Alembertian eff tribute itself Reborn Diameter and Link Devotee and Mandatory eff *(if you have any extenders in your hand like Subtraction/Addition you don't need to tax the Alembertian and he stays on the field as a negate of Nibiru if the opponent has it)  Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter Hand adn Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Wicckid and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Wicckid eff banish Balancer Lord Add Nabla Balancer Lord eff Special Nabla and Nabla eff tribute Linguriboh SS Sigma from Deck LINK-2 I:P Masquerena and Set Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wickid + I:P Masquerena + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Sigma  /////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Sigma + Subtraction/Addition</strong>  Sigma eff SS from Hand and Subtraction/Addition eff SS from Hand Link Disciple and Link Devotee and Mandatory eff and Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter Hand adn Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Wicckid and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Wicckid eff banish Devotee Add Nabla NS Nabla and eff tribute Linguriboh SS Diameter from Deck RANK-4 Alembertian and eff Add Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wicckid + Alembertian + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Subtraction/Addition  /////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Subtraction + Parallel eXceed (basically any Normal Summon from the deck + eXceed)</strong>  NS Subtraction and Link Disciple and eXceed eff Link Devotee and Mandatory eff and Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter hand and Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Splash Mage and eff Reborn Subtraction and LINK-2 Wicckid RANK-4 Alembertian and eff cl1 Add Superfactorial and Wicckid eff cl2 Add Nabla and Alembertian eff tribute itself SS Nabla and eff tribute SS Diameter from Deck and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Set Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wicckid + Linguriboh + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Subtraction  ///////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo: Balancer Lord + Sigma (basically any other Mathmech Monster other than Diameter + Balancer Lord)</strong>  NS Balancer Lord and eff pay1000LP and NS Sigma Link Disciple and Link Devotee and Mandatory eff and Disciple eff tribute Devotee filter Hand adn Devotee eff create 2 Tokens LINK-2 Wicckid and LINK-1 Linguriboh and Wicckid eff banish Balancer Lord Add Nabla Balancer Lord eff Special Nabla and Nabla eff tribute Linguriboh SS Diameter from Deck RANK-4 Alembertian and eff Add Superfactorial  Gamestate: Wicckid + Alembertian + Superfactorial /in GY: Diameter + Nabla + Sigma  /////////////////////////////////////////////////  Put the continuation of the link on the <strong>duelingbook</strong> website after <strong>.com/</strong>  replay?id=813757-38220625 Test Hands Before Support Mathmech TCG Apr22 - In general you will always be able to setup <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> + <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> but sometimes you <strong>won't have 3 Mathmech Monsters in the GY</strong> for Superfactorial because the hand didn't come out good, but otherwise the test hands presented help you a lot to understand how to use Mathmech.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Technoplay:</strong>  <a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> omni negate allows you to be <strong>guaranteed access to</strong> <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> when using <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> eff because you <strong>negate the Hand Trap</strong> he chained to his effect. That's why you <strong>always try to make</strong> <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> on your 1st turn using <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> as material. And on the opponent's turn the <strong>Diameter omni negate</strong> given to the <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> has to be used with caution given the hand traps you have in your hand, sometimes <strong>you can spare the hand trap</strong> like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> if it is clear that negating with <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> the opponent already there will be no more ways to continue playing.  In the case of starting with a <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> draw, many of the combos can be done in order <strong>to guarantee having 3 Mathmech Monster in the GY</strong> including the <a data-name=""Diameter"">Diameter</a> over 5 summons, avoiding instantly finding yourself in a <strong>bad position in the game if you take Nibiru</strong>. For this <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> is essential to access the third name of Mathmech in the first summons. Even if you take <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> or any other card that takes one of the 3 targets from the GY's with <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> eff, you can Summon the other 2 Mathmech Monsters and RANK-4 <a data-name=""Alembertian"">Alembertian</a> in place of Laplacian.  <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> is one of the best hand traps against this deck because <strong>currently the hands played around it require 3-card combos</strong>. In other cases you are <strong>very dependent on the search</strong> effect of <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> passing to continue your plays which makes the <strong>deck not very resilient</strong> to common hand traps of the format. But I say that for sure these <strong>shortcomings will put an end to Mathmech Circular in the game</strong>.  <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> is your biggest blind second card nightmare when playing Mathmech so in cases of passing with <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> and <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> interaction always use <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> interaction <strong>first even if you have to use Wicckid</strong> to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> and miss its Follow Up.  All Special Summoned Main Deck Mathmech Monsters <strong>have restrictions</strong> - <a data-name=""Mathmech Addition"">Mathmech Addition</a>, <a data-name=""Mathmech Subtraction"">Mathmech Subtraction</a>, <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a>: - Everyone restricts you from <strong>Special Summoning Cyberse monsters from the Extra Deck</strong>. - <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> will be <strong>banned when leaving the field</strong> unless used as an Xyz Material. - <a data-name=""Addition"">Addition</a> and <a data-name=""Subtraction"">Subtraction</a> <strong>can't attack for the rest of the turn</strong> and that's why I always Special Summon them in <strong>Defense Position</strong> as they won't be able to attack anyway. - <a data-name=""Mathmech Addition"">Mathmech Addition</a> and <a data-name=""Mathmech Subtraction"">Mathmech Subtraction</a> are even better <strong>going second</strong> as they can <strong>target opponent's monsters</strong> without you having to spend your Normal Summon early. And there's still the detail that the monster they target <strong>doesn't need to lose or gain 1000atk</strong> for them to be Special Summoned.  <strong>Additional Effects</strong> You Should Consider: <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a> allows a monster made in the Extra Monster Zone to <strong>attack Monsters twice</strong> during the Battle Phase. <a data-name=""Mathmech Multiplication"">Mathmech Multiplication</a> <strong>doubles the atk</strong> of a monster you control in the Extra Monster Zone which synergizes very well with <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> for <strong>inflicting double battle damage</strong> on the opponent so you pretty much OTK attack any opponent's <strong>monster that has 2k atk or less</strong>. which is easy since Subtraction can decrease ATK by 1000. And finally, we have the detail that <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> can be <strong>used as a non-tuner for a Synchro</strong> Summon of Mathmech monsters.  <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> has a <strong>Mandatory effect</strong> that is not once per turn when it is Link Summoned from you <strong>lock in doing only LINK-2 or less</strong>. I use two Link Devotees in this format because the Token engine made <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre"">Ghost Ogre</a> popular again which means if I'm facing a player who knows how to correctly use Ghost Ogre against Mathmech he <strong>will use the mandatory Link Devotee effect</strong> then the second copy is needed to allow you to combo <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> if you take Ghost Ogre.  Against trap decks, don't think twice about <strong>starting your turn by doing</strong> <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> in scare to avoid losing to floodgates.  <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> is the only <strong>way to follow up on Mathmech's deck</strong> because even on the opponent's turn you can <strong>trigger search eff</strong> by Special Summoning a monster in the zone he points to using <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> eff or <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a>. It <strong>protects your monsters from being destroyed by card effects</strong> so makes your end board even better against blind second cards like <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>.  Many times you will make <strong>more Link Monsters</strong> which at first point of view are unnecessary summons but <strong>in the end give you more pops</strong> to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>. For example in <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> + 2 <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> you can do: Linguriboh then <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> reborn from GY and do <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> and do <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> bringing I:P Masquerena back and finally <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a>.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Important interactions to know against metagame decks:</strong>  When you have to take <a data-name=""Mirrorjade"">Mirrorjade</a> out of the field with <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> <strong>without protection</strong> from <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> then the best thing is to use Accesscode eff <strong>banish itself to destroy Mirrorjade</strong> just to prevent the opponent from being able to Reborn Accesscode with <a data-name=""Dark Charmer"">Dark Charmer</a>. Speaking of <a data-name=""Dark Charmer"">Dark Charmer</a>, this card is so good that I almost <strong>always banish I:P Masquerena as Wicckid's activation cost</strong> when I do <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> to prevent him from giving Reborn.  Chain <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> not on <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> <strong>activation but on</strong> <a data-name=""Lubellion"">Lubellion</a> effect because you take <a data-name=""Mirrorjade"">Mirrorjade</a> off the field and already <strong>forces it to use the effect of banishing a monster</strong> from the field as soon as it enters.  <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a> vs <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> Unlike cards like <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Revolt"">Tri-Brigade Revolt</a>, even if you use <strong>Superfactorial as cl2 to the opponent's DPE effect</strong>, what will happen is to bring the <a data-name=""Laplacian"">Laplacian</a> to the field and even if it's not in the zone that <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> points out, there's no problem because you <strong>protect him of destruction with its own continuous effect</strong> so you are always <strong>guaranteed that its effect when it is Xyz Summoned</strong> will activate and take up to two cards from the opponent in this case in addition to having the <strong>Diameter Omni Negate</strong> to negate the effect of the Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer on the GY.  <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> is absurd against <a data-name=""Floowandereeze"">Floowandereeze</a>, it only has <strong>Continuous Spell</strong> <a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds"">Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds</a> out or Tribute Summon <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and if you leave any of the <strong>small birds on the field</strong> like <a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Robina"">Floowandereeze &amp; Robina</a> it automatically <strong>increases the chance of losing the game</strong> with an ATK.  Another cool thing about <strong>Mathmech versus Floowandereeze</strong> is that even with <a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Empen</a> on the field you <strong>have ways to clear his field</strong> thanks to <a data-name=""Primathmech Laplacian"">Primathmech Laplacian</a> so always try to see plays of <strong>making Laplacian to force his interactions</strong>.  Make <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> under <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> = Always remember that on the field effects denied <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> <strong>returns to 2000atk/def and is level 8</strong> so you can for example make <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> and <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> eff and use eXceed and <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a>/<a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a>/<a data-name=""Mathmech Diameter"">Mathmech Diameter</a> to make <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> and go to Beat Down and buy time until you have out for <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> not to mention that if Final Sigma leaves the field you <strong>add a Mathmech card</strong> to your hand as <a data-name=""Superfactorial"">Superfactorial</a>. Another tip for dealing with <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> is to use <a data-name=""Subtraction"">Subtraction</a> and <a data-name=""Addition"">Addition</a> effects to decrease the ATK of an opponent's monster or increase your monsters ATK and take it out in battle as <a data-name=""Golden Lord"">Golden Lord</a> etc since they are effects that activate in the hand and are <strong>not affected by Skill Drain</strong>. But of course the only out in monster form for Skill Drain after being activated is <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> banishing itself from the field as a cost. <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> vs <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>: If <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> <strong>was already activated before</strong> <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> entered the field, it comes with the <strong>effects negated</strong> so it's no use doing it in the Extra Monster Zone, but if Final Sigma was on the field in the Extra Monster Zone <strong>before of Skill Drain is activated</strong> then it will <strong>continue to be Unaffected</strong> by Card Effects.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Missplays you must avitate to win games:</strong>  Analyze if the Combo you are going to make <strong>loses to a hand trap</strong> because if so it is better to use <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> at the <strong>beginning of the combo to see if the hand becomes more resilient</strong> to interactions.  Trying to keep <a data-name=""Mathmech Sigma"">Mathmech Sigma</a> in the GY when his combo is weak for an interaction with <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> and couldn't do <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> which made his end board much worse.  You should <strong>analyze what to return to the deck after Link Disciple's draw</strong> because if it's any monster in the deck that <strong>can extend its plays after interactions</strong> when your combo is fragile to hand traps <strong>if you return the monster to the deck it could mean losing to</strong> an <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>/<a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> in <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> eff.  Do not play around <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> on your <a data-name=""Wicckid"">Wicckid</a> + <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> End Board when you <strong>knew the opponent used that card</strong> in the Main Deck. It's better not to have <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> interaction than to lose almost all of your field to a <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>.  You can <strong>Normal Summon a hand trap to make</strong> <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a>. It just <strong>cannot Special Summon non-Cyberse on the turn you do it</strong>. So if you do <a data-name=""Balancer Lord"">Balancer Lord</a> eff Special Summon <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> you won't be able to Transcode Talker.  &nbsp;"

It plays a in a very control style, and the cool thing about the deck is the versatility it has in match ups. if you have fairy you can recycle xyz monsters in the graveyard to go into Utopic future which is a very strong play with not too many outs.

You are welcome to change those monsters in any way you like if you have a better idea.

First off, my knowledge in this archetype is a lot lower than my knowledge of infernoid, so  feel free to give me any advice.</span>  <span>The new “altergeist card” that won about one game by itself was <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>. At first, I thought that card was convoluted to use alongside a deck that is highly dependent on the monster's effect. However with <a data-name=""Altergeist Protocol"">Altergeist Protocol</a>, my boys…girls…. altergeists things cannot  have their effects negates. That's super neat to shut down my opponent’s board.</span>  <span>Second thing to talk about is the use of three <a data-name=""Altergeist Pookuery"">Altergeist Pookuery</a>. Going First, I loved the fact that this card was glued on every opening hand, because I was guaranteed to make a good  board. However, going second this card just bricked me a lot. In the end, I can see that using three was beneficial because of siding these cards off for my techs on the side deck. </span>  <span>Now every other card is just the same strategy that everyone hates about altergeist: Say No to everything that the opponent does. </span>  <span>The Highlights that I am going to do is:</span> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>“<a data-name=""The Warning Point”"">The Warning Point”</a>, This trap took a lot of my opponent off guard, because it shut down effects and cannot be used for anything until the next turn.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Using <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> instead of <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>, Card advantage is everything on this deck, even more than get a combo piece. This card helped me a lot.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>More <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> than <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, a lot of monsters that summon themselves by effects. That 's the reason. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Waking the dragon and the “ Trio Parada dura”, just a spice for the second game.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span><a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> is a beautiful card. </span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Finally, I can guarantee that (even though I did not do well in the local tournament), I did not make any friends. This deck is only for your amusement. </span>"

Heroes deck focused on generating hand advantage and summoning a variety of Extra Deck monsters to break through opposing boards for an O,"Mostly pure Elemental Heroes focused deck. Aim to go second, hopefully opening with a hand trap or two to disrupt the worst of your opponent's setup, then go for an OTK on your turn. The monster effects of the combination of Liquid Soldier, Shadow Mist, Blazeman, and Stratos let you summon a variety of fusion monsters while still maintaining hand advantage. The deck provides a solid toolbox for getting around most forms of protection. Captain Gold can be discarded by its own effect, providing material for Miracle Fusion, and Skyscraper is either an easy discard candidate itself (for something like Liquid Soldier's draw effect) or can allow you to win combat if you're locked out of the Extra Deck. The best choices for Shadow Mist's search are either Stratos, or Honest Neos. Stratos is best for when you fuse Shadow Mist and Liquid Soldier together, structure the chain so that you search Stratos first, then discard Stratos for Liquid Soldier's effect. Then, you can either use Stratos to summon E. Hero Tornado with Miracle Fusion, or special summon it with Liquid Soldier on a later turn to destroy at least one spell/trap on the opponent's field and then follow up with a Rank 4 Xyz or a Link-2 as an extending play. Remember that the hand traps like Ash Blossom, Ghost Mourner, and Effect Veiler can also be used as fusion materials in a pinch as well.  If you have to go first, or you're unable to OTK this turn, the deck has just a few options for closers. Masked Hero Dark Law shuts down many meta strategies by itself. A combination of Absolute Zero plus a set Mask Change allows you to activate a one-sided board wipe at any time, and is generally easier to setup than transforming Honor Ark into Zeus for a similar effect. Rivalry of Warlords is also a useful stun tool since a majority of the Deck are Warrior type monsters.  The Side Deck contains two alternative strategies. One is a Vision Hero package that allows for more swarming ability for maintaining card advantage on the field. You can substitute in the extra Rank 4 Xyz monsters for additional removal tools. The other strategy is a discount Kaiju strategy revolving around Super Polymerization to remove threats from your opponent's field when they are capable of putting up multiple layers of protection for their boss monsters. Adjust the Side Deck to fit your target meta. The Main Deck is already balanced around the Master Duel meta and performs well up into Gold Rank.  Consider substituting out Blazeman and the regular Polymerizations for the Vision Hero package (replace one Emergency Call with Reinforcement of the Army), and substitute out some of the fusion monsters in the Extra Deck for more generic Xyz and Link monsters.

since we are playing lots brick we can discard them to summon out our lvl 1 tuners really easily to make needlefiber and also if you have any extenders like the legacy or reborn they can help you extend the combo even further.  The reason why I only play 2 <strong>return of the dragons lord</strong> because the third one really never comes up for me during my play testing.  The reason why I play<strong> dragon shrine</strong> is because of its secondary effect for example: sending blue-eyes+ stone of legend or either  blue-eyes+ wyvern.  The reason why I play the <strong>eclipse wyvern </strong>and <strong>RedMD(Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon)</strong> is because your able to to send it off with the <strong>dragon shrine</strong> and with the<strong> galaxy eyes dark matter dragon.</strong> The main banish dragon monster off of Wyvern is the <strong>RedMD(Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon)</strong>.

At this time:</strong>  <strong>- Germany and France sold weapons to Russia.</strong> <strong>This weapon is killing ukrainians now - check it out.</strong> <strong>- Germany was building more pipes and pumping billions of euros into Russia.</strong> <strong>The previous pipelines ran through Ukraine, which secured them a bit, as the safety of these pipelines was of interest to Russia.</strong>  <strong>What is happening now, while thousands of Ukrainians are killed, starved and is buried under the rubble:</strong>  <strong>- Germany,  is against the real sanction. Germany introduces illusory sanctions on Russian banks.</strong> <strong>Sanctions on Russian banks except 2 largest Russian banks and the rest of the Russian banks make transactions through them.</strong> <strong>- The european union pays € 800 million Russian for energy resources every day.</strong> <strong> Germany, France and Netherlands is against sanction on these raw materials.</strong>  <strong>I appeals to common sense, leaders of many countries, because I have no reason to appeal to their decency.</strong> <strong>An attack on another country or maybe blowing up a few nuclear power plants in Ukraine,</strong> <strong>or maybe some other step and we are one step away from an even greater tragedy.</strong>  <strong>Will you enjoy your fortune, luxury houses and yachts when the world turns into a nuclear deserts ?!</strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>Thank also to all users yugiohpro for understanding.</strong> <strong>I know that this message is not easy, but I also know that over 90% of my deck users are adult people</strong> <strong>(maybe each of us separately and together we can also change something).</strong>"

Activate home, chain Dagda; set scythe, resolve home with any twin, red preferably. Link off the twin and dagda into trouble sunny trouble sunny can split back into the 2 evil twins and pop scythe on the opponent's turn. The twin+ extender play should look like summon twin+eff, summon extender, go into evil twin, ss the other from grave (should have an evil twin and live twin of the same color, and then ss the other color. Link them off + 1 opponent monster for goddess. Otherwise I would recommend just normaling a twin, linking into anaconda, and going into dpe and getting the draw 2 in quickly. The idea is to thin out the deck while at the very least, make a solid play. Also on your following turn, you can clear your monsters with dpe so you can get more twin plays through, I tried to fit the adventure token engine in here, but I feel the hand traps will be more useful. The hand trap line up is flexible, but I highly recommend gamma as it can be a really solid combo extender if you get ash'd early"

Thanks to Extra-Deck consistency tools like Tearalaments Kitkalos, the deck is quite consistent and capable of easily cycling through a variety of different Fusions to suit your needs. Ideally you will go first, summon Kitkalos, search out Tearalaments Salic and summon some number of Tearalaments and other Fusion monsters, but thanks to plentiful room for tech cards, handtraps and the archetypal handtrap of Tearalaments Haufenis, the deck is reasonably competent when going second. My ratios and reasoning are as follows:  Main Deck: <strong>3x Tearalaments Rainoheart </strong>- the main character of the deck and your most reliable starter. On summon he mills any Tearalaments monster to instantly make a fusion, usually Kitkalos, and he can be sent from the hand or deck off of a variety of cards to trigger his effect to special summon from the GY. Absolutely mandatory at 3, as he is the best normal summon and discard fodder in the deck, and most of the time you will either want to open him or search him out using Kitkalos or the Field Spell.  <strong>3x Tearalaments Shaylen</strong> - the archetypal extender. Shaylen is fantastic as she can be used to pitch any cloggy monsters in hand to trigger their effects while also milling 3 more cards from your deck, which will typically enable a fusion play. As this deck has a good amount of RNG involved in its plays, you want as many Tearalaments names as possible in the deck to ensure that Fusing is always available, so as of now I would argue every Tearalaments Monster should be played at 3.  <strong>3x Tearalaments Haufenis</strong> - an archetypal handtrap/extender. Haufenis relies on your opponent to trigger her hand effect, but in exchange enables some nasty Fusion combos on your opponents turn, including on turn 1 when you're going second. Depending on the cards you mill off of her, you can make a variety of powerful interruptions on your opponents turn such as Millennium-Eyes Restrict (if <strong>King of the Swamp</strong> is milled- more on this later), Predaplant Dragostapelia (after making Kitkalos and using her to mill a different Tearalaments monster), and even El Shaddoll Winda (if <strong>Shaddoll Beast </strong>is milled).  <strong>3x Tearalaments Mieru</strong>- arguably the worst of the bunch as she can clash with Rainoheart for your normal summon, Mieru gives you an additional option for milling cards to continue your combos and set up your GY. A common play is to summon her off of the effect of Kitkalos to mill 8 cards from your deck and almost always enable 1-2 Fusions.  <strong>3x King of the Swamp</strong>- King of the Swamp fulfills multiple roles in this deck, allowing you to search out Polymerization to allow for alternative methods of Fusing without relying on milling Tearalaments and also can serve as any specifically-named fusion material. King of the Swamp allows you to make far more than the otherwise limited pool of Fusions Tearalaments would be capable of making, most notably cards like Millennium-Eyes Restrict (who requires Relinquished as material) and Lubellion the Searing Dragon (who requires Fallen of Albaz as material). King of the Swamp is also an Aqua-type Monster, meaning it can serve as one of the generic materials for Kaleidoheart and Kitkalos, and it can also be used in place of Rainoheart in order to make Kaleidoheart. As you will be Fusing using materials in your GY, discarding it to search Polymerization essentially gives you free GY setup while searching you a potential extender. While you could theoretically play less than 3, the card gives you enough value and versatility that I currently max out on it.  <strong>2x Shaddoll Beast</strong>- a Shaddoll played to enable summons of El Shaddoll Winda. You could play any of the Shaddolls for this purpose, but I've found that Beast is generally the best as it gives you a Draw when sent off any of your card effects, such as any mill effect or if sent from the hand for Shaylen. I currently play 2 to ensure I see it frequently enough without bricking on them, but you could easily run more/less Shaddoll names by preference.  <strong>3x Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju / Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring / Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit / Infinite Impermanence</strong>- the going-second cards. These 12 flex spots could be anything you feel like playing to suit your particular meta, but I like these particular handtraps due to their versatility. I play 3x Gameciel as it is not only a powerful removal option (and this is somewhat lacking in non-targeting removal effects), but also because its Aqua typing allows it to be used as Fusion material for the Tearalaments Fusions if milled.  <strong>3x Perlayno, the Primal Parallel Ruined Realm / 1x Terraforming</strong>- the Field Spell(s). Perlayno searches for any Tearalaments Monster on activation, allowing more access to your combo pieces. Furthermore, Perlayno can pop a card on <em>either field</em> whenever you use one of your Tearalaments' Fusion effects (once per turn), allowing you to break boards, have an additional interaction when Fusing on your opponent's turn, and trigger your cards that activate upon being sent to the GY (such as Kitkalos' effect to mill 5). I max out on the Field Spell as it isn't currently searchable and can grab any Tearalaments Monster you want, but you could drop Terraforming if you find it cloggy.  <strong>2x Polymerization / 1x Instant Fusion</strong>- Polymerization is here as a free card off of King of the Swamp and to enable alternative routes for Fusion Summoning, while Instant Fusion can be used to instantly make Kitkalos, who in turn searches for any Tearalaments card in your deck. Instant Fusion can also be used to make Time Wizard of Tomorrow to break boards, or Millennium-Eyes Restrict to counter some common handtraps and interactions. You could cut these cards if you find yourself wanting more room, but I've found this to be a comfortable ratio.  <strong>3x Tearalaments Salic</strong>- Salic serves as a reliable interruption, a consistency enabler and a method of Fusing during your opponent's turn. If milled or sent by any effect it searches for any Tearalaments monster, and utilizing the on-field negation effect allows you to trigger any of your Tearalaments effects at will. I run 3 as you want to both have one copy in hand and at least one to mill for the searching effect.  <strong>1x Tearalaments Metanoise</strong>- Metanoise gives you a Book of Moon-like interruption while also milling a Tearalaments monster in the process, allowing you an additional method of Fusing as a quick-effect. However, the GY effect of Metanoise is surprisingly niche as you'll rarely end up in a position with monsters to add back from your GY to your hand as they all shuffle themselves back into your deck when Fusing. As a result, I only run the 1 copy as it is very searchable and you'd rather not hit this with your mills early-on, but you could easily play more copies.  Extra Deck: <strong>3x Tearalaments Kitkalos</strong>- the main fusion of the deck, Kitkalos allows you to have a high degree of consistency while enabling large chains of effects. She is easily summoned, giving you the ability to search or send any of your Tearalaments cards at will from almost any position. Most commonly, you'll use Kitkalos' effect on herself to summon a Tearalaments Monster from hand/GY while triggering her effect to mill 5. While she can technically be recycled infinitely, I run 3 copies to ensure that I always have access to Kitkalos even if one gets banished or if you play a bit fast and loose with your Fusing, but you could just as easily run 2 copies if you find yourself wanting more room.  <strong>2x Tearalaments Kaleidoheart</strong>- the main boss of the deck. Kaleidoheart is a quick-effect shuffle into deck on summon <em>and</em> whenever an Aqua Monster is sent to the GY by card effect, allowing you to easily spin cards on either player's turn. He also can special summon himself from the GY for free whenever he is sent there by a card effect, and mills a Tearalaments card in the process. This frequently comes in handy both for making him difficult to out and also allowing him to serve as an extender by milling a Tearalaments Monster for their Fusion effects, or by milling Salic/Metanoise for their GY effects. I run 2 copies as he is the biggest monster you can summon off of Tearalaments Monsters in order to push for damage, as well as to have one as a backup in case the first is banished, but you can technically recycle him off of the reborn effect of Kitkalos and could thus get away with only playing 1 if you so desire.  <strong>2x Predaplant Dragostapelia</strong>- one of your main forms of interaction, Dragostapelia can be made with surprising ease in this deck and gives you access to a simple negation effect on a soft once-per-turn. I play 2 as you can frequently make 2, and one can be recycled by fusing into a new copy using the one in your GY. Furthermore, the materials of Dragostapelia allow you to recycle any of your other Fusions, giving Tearalaments a strong grind game.  <strong>1x Lubellion the Searing Dragon</strong>- made using King of the Swamp as material, Lubellion allows you to put an additional body on the field while Fusing, or to recycle Monsters from your GY/Banished zone. Lubellion also satisfies the requirement to use the effect of Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon.  <strong> 1x Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</strong>- a strong non-targeting quick-effect banish that can be made using King of the Swamp and any Extra Deck monster, with an additional boardwipe effect if it gets removed. Mirrorjade can be a bit difficult to summon reliably due to its awkward material requirements, but its effects are certainly strong enough to make up for it.  <strong> 1x El Shaddoll Winda</strong>- made using a milled Shaddoll Beast, Winda gives you a devastating floodgate that can be extremely difficult for some decks to play around/out. Tearalaments play quite nicely around her effect as well, as you rarely need more than one Special Summon per turn after establishing a field and you can easily get rid of her by using her for a Fusion if need be.  <strong> 1x Time Wizard of Tomorrow</strong>- made using King of the Swamp in place of Time Wizard, Time Wizard of Tomorrow is a bit of a niche board clear typically used when trying to power through tough fields or as a last-ditch nuclear option. I don't often make it, and as such could easily be replaced by anything else should you desire to do so.  <strong> 1x Millennium-Eyes Restrict</strong>- made using King of the Swamp in place of Relinquished, Millennium-Eyes Restrict allows you to counter all manner of handtraps and disruptions while removing cards from your opponent's field/GY. As Millennium-Eyes Restrict isn't a hard once-per-turn, you could easily play and potentially summon more than 1 should you choose to run more.  <strong> 1x Number 39: Utopia / 1x Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</strong>- I run Utopia the Lightning as an Extra Deck out to get rid of things this deck otherwise has a hard time clearing. Untargetable/indestructible Monsters like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and unaffected Monsters like The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister can be a problem for this deck as nearly everything in this deck either targets or destroys, but luckily there are no restrictions anywhere on your effects that prevent you from running toolbox monsters in your Extra Deck to deal with said problems. While this is the option I currently run due to its low material investment, you could also play other removal options such as Borrelsword Dragon, Accesscode Talker (with a Link-3+ in your Extra Deck) or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, though they can be difficult to summon under fire.  <strong> 1x Time Thief Redoer</strong>- Redoer has an interesting place in this deck, as he is a relatively strong generic Xyz Monster that happens to detach his materials as part of his effect, rather than for cost. This means that Redoer can be used to trigger the effects of the Tearalaments Monsters you use to Summon him, those being the Fusion effect of Shaylen and the revive and subsequent mill effect of Rainoheart, and as a quick-effect no less.  The Side Deck in this list is currently comprised of some other options you could run. -Mare of the Shore is a decent normal summon who fulfills the same role as Rainoheart while also being an Aqua Monster for your Tearalaments Fusions. -Invoked Caliga is a powerful floodgate Fusion you can make using King of the Swamp in place of Aleister the Invoker. -Mudragon of the Swamp can technically be made in this deck to recycle any non-Aqua Dark Monster and give your Monsters targeting protection. -Knightmare Phoenix, Cerberus and Unicorn are decent generic Link Monsters that can be somewhat easily made, though their roles are covered by various Tearalaments cards anyway. -Super Polymerization can be used to great effect in this deck as it naturally plays a myriad of generic and semi-generic Fusion Monsters, and King of the Swamp can be Set to allow you to Fuse away any monster using Super Polymerization for something like Millennium-Eyes Restrict (who can be made using any Effect Monster). -Tearalaments Crime is the archetypal omni-negate Counter Trap, and while it is indeed a powerful effect, I found it to be too costly to be set up reliably. The GY effect isn't particularly useful either, and with no current in-archetype way of recovering milled spells/traps, I feel it best to ignore Tearalaments Crime for now. -Foolish Burial Goods can be used to send Tearalaments Salic/Metanoise to trigger their GY effects, allowing you to search or recover a Tearalaments Monster at will. However, I found it to be somewhat redundant as the deck already has many ways of doing this, not to mention that Foolish Burial Goods can be bricky and does nothing for you if milled. I would play at most 1-2 copies if you do decide to play it. -Foolish Burial falls into the many of the same problems as Foolish Burial Goods. It can potentially allow you to extend and mill a Tearalaments Monster to trigger their effects, but it felt redundant and unncesessary to me. -Reinforcement of the Army can be used to search Rainoheart as he happens to be a Warrior Type Monster, but I generally felt that the deck has enough ways of getting to him without it."

You want to start with either Venus or a combo of dragonfly+hornet/gigamantis/ladybug.  If you start with venus, get 3 shineballs on the field in Def and XYZ into gantatsu.  Ideally with the inzektors, you want gigamantis attatched to dragonfly to give it some beatstick protection.  Gorz, torrential tribute, mirror force, etc. are generic support/defensive cards to use.  If you're able to use Tualatin against an opponent, you can lock them down.  Same with archlord Krystia.  Hyperion and BLS both are good at clearing the field.  I've recently added Trishula as the inzectors are very good at level manipulation, combined with Venus's ability to get multiple low-level monsters on the field.  Wish I would have thought of this years ago."

Over the years however, several cards have been released which unintentionally make it slightly easier to activate.  Ideally, you'd like to succeed in this combo during your first or second turn before your opponent can set up their board of negates. I've included some options in the side deck to help with stalling or going second.  Ideally your turn goes something like this, summon Dark Doriado which you can alternatively achieve through Summoner Monk. Excavate your cards, then activate Enchanting Fitting room which will special summon each of your necessary monsters for Huge Revolution to be activated. Set trap trick or huge revolution. The main issue with Huge Revolution is that it must be activated during YOUR main phase. So all three of your monsters must survive your opponents turn in order for you to activate Huge Revolution on your next turn. In case they don't, Tri-Wight and Monster Reborn are key cards to bring your monsters back after they've been destroyed. If you manage to complete the combo in your first turn, Temple of the Kings will allow you to activate Huge Revolution immediately.  &nbsp;  Another way to accomplish this combo is with Rescue Ferret and Saryuja Skull dread. If you have the furry emancipator in your hand and manage to get four monsters on the field to link summon Saryuja, you can special summon Rescue Ferret from your hand and activate its effect to special summon your three key monster cards from your deck. However they will be destroyed during your end phase so make sure you can activate Huge Revolution that turn if you take this route.  Overall, this deck is quite inconsistent and resolving Huge Revolution is still a difficult feat. However the feeling of accomplishment once you do is unlike any other."

Summon Diviner, and send Trias Hierarchia with her effect. Use Hierarchia in the grave, and tribute Diviner to summon her. Diviner will proc, use her effect to summon Valkyrie Sechste. Sechste will proc, use her to summon Sigrun. Then just XYZ Sigrun and Hierarchia into VFD. You can use any other monsters you have after this too, such as an Aluber to grab Theater and use him and Sechste for Quaeritis, or using any other effect combination you have in hand.</span>  <span>Archlord Kristya is a floodgate than can be summoned by First Darklords effect should you get the opportunity to, for example by sending it with Diviner or Foolish Burial. </span>  <span>Everything else is relatively the same as a normal Despia Darklord deck.

Yeah it's bascially that except it has waifus and can fusion summon from the gy. ,"This deck is excatly what you expect, you ns a Tearalament, mill some cards, activate some gy effects, fusion summon a bunch of times and end on winda + some other stuff.  Here is the stuff which makes it different to shaddoll invoked:  It can make Winda in the opponents turn without using schism. How? Simple you use Haufenis to summon herself and mill 3 cards or If you went first end made your board with Kitkalos and Salic, you negate an opponents monster eff with salic and send Kitkalos to the gy to mill 5 cards. Then If you milled an Shaddoll and a Tearalament you can use those to summon Winda. It sounds pretty rng based at first, but in the end it comes up more often than you would expect, especially if you used Kitkalos to mill 5.  It has access to Bahamut Shark, so it can make Toadally Awesome! The basic combo would be Rainoheart + any other Tearalament: Ns Rainoheart, Send a Tearalament monster to the gy, fusion summon Kitkalos, eff Kitkalos to Send Rainoheart, eff Kitkalos to ss Rainoheart, Overlay both Rainohearts for Bahamut Shark while also getting a mill 5 off of Kitkalos.  You always have some fuel for your schism, since you mill your entire deck in a couple of turns.  And the last point is that you basically have infinite Windas since you can just use a tearlament to recycle the Winda, so 2 Windas are a infinite loop (Hey That's the dante/cir loop, but in better). Btw I play 3 Windas, just because.. ehm... actaully idk it either. You can probably replace it with something else like a 2nd Gravity Controller, Abyss Dweller or a link monster like Underworld Godess or Knigmare Unicorn.  &nbsp;  Is it better than Shaddoll Invoked and Shaddoll Invoked Dogmatika?  Maybe, only time will tell, but there's definetley some potential here. It could definetley be better depending on the support we will get in Darkwing Blast, I personally think that it's either a Link-1 or another Fusion. And no matter what it is, if it's on the same level as the scareclaw link-1 then it could definetley be a meta contender.  &nbsp;  So yeah that's for the Shaddoll varient, next up is tearalaments despia/branded, Oh man that's gonna be fun..., until then!"
