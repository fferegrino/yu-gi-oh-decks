The only downside is that it's kind of difficult to shuffle such a big deck lol. Running the Dragoon package of course, because it's a powerful boss monster. Same with Ulimate Conductor Tyranno. With Double Evolution Pill you just need one Dino in your hand or GY, and Misc/Archosaur can help you get there consistently. Eldlich is overall a strong archetype, and all the spell cards makes it easy to summon Golden Lord. Ten Thousand Dragon is great for OTK'ing your opponent in one attack. Catches your opponent off-guard, and is very satisfying to pull off! Dogmatika is good at disrupting your opponent. Invoked lets you get to Mechaba for more negates, and there are plenty of light-attribute targets in the deck. Dragonmaids are an interesting tech option I've been exploring to unbrick if you aren't able to summon 10k Dragon. Similarly, the Evil HEROs are quite powerful and difficult to deal with. Aside from the main archetypes, some solid competitive staples are included because you can't really go wrong with them.  The extra deck is mostly straightforward, with the fusion monsters being associated with the above archetypes. Gustav Max is easy to go into with Golden Lord, UCT, and 10k Dragon all being level 10. From there you can burn and go into Liebe for massive damage, and if they're still alive somehow you go into Zeus! Underworld Goddess is a great removal option since linking your opponent's monsters gets around pretty much all forms of protection. Accesscode, BLS, and Anaconda are insane. Anima is good to go into from Archosaur, and stealing your opponent's monster is pretty cool.  Overall, I think this is a very powerful deck that pretty much anyone can afford. It is a highly unpredictable deck that can switch from slow control style to fast-paced OTK. It has outs for any situation I could think of. The only thing is I wanted to incorporate Drytrons as well, but the special summon restriction makes it hard to work. Regardless, I could see this becoming a Tier 1 or maybe even Tier 0 deck in the near future!  If this deck is still a little outside your price range, feel free to swap Infinite Impermanence for Effect Veiler."

Featuring an omni-negate boss monster (Sheou), and various starters to gain access to your fusion spell and 30 million extenders, this deck is probably the main deck to make use of the Hieratic link monster. The deck can make use of dragon link-esque guardragon combos, as well as various interruptions in the form of the hieratic link, and the trap Dragonmaid Tidying.  tl;dr dragon maid waifus gain advantage every turn because of their angry boss monster who turns into her normal self after saying no as well as going +2 every standby phase.

The deck needs its entire hand to function, so if your board gets broken you're SOL When handtrapped you might still have some wiggle room to squeeze out a Dragoon or I:P + Dragoon for some basic interruption.  This deck can't go second. Win the die roll.  The side deck is format dependent, but the Gameciels and Dark Rulers have stuck around for a while in an attempt to mitigate the going second problem. If you really wanna make going second not suck, you can side in the cards to swap your Dragoon engine for a Rainbow Neos engine in game 2."

You want to get Mara on board with joy to grab Oneiromancy or Black Knight, if you cant then you go fully into chaos combo's.  Dangers are their to help get extra monsters on board and to add extra Allure of Darkness targets, I suggest only using them once you use all your important cards unless you have Effect Veiler in hand.  If you are able to keep you normal summon by getting one for one, you can extend with Effect Veiler to make Halqifibrax which can then climb into Selene or Unicorn, depending on if you have enough spells in grave and on field.  More optional cards are: <ul>  	<li>Chaos Daedelus unless you want to add Hypnagogia.</li>  	<li>Dream Mirror Disciple as its just an extender for Phantasms if you are unable to get the correct field spell with Mara although it does make using Set Rotation alot safer as you can return the field spell back to hand.</li>  	<li>Effect Veiler, Halqifibrax and Selene if the cost is too high or you would rather run some other extra deck options and alternative hand traps (preferably light/dark).</li> </ul>"

As noted, this is a very casual deck I experiment with to play with friends  Other ideas: * Havenât added 1.5-card Spheres engines (to dilute the combo pieces) since these combo pieces so far arenât horrible in-handâ¦ and Dragunity Remus w/ Guisarme could be a nice discard engine * Hieratic Seal of Creation: Personally reallllly like to send it to the GY (Foolish Burial Goods/Brotaur) because it can revive Spheres...&amp; Hieratic+Brotaur+Spheres is a fast Apollusa * Rose Dragons are really powerful fun (&amp; Roxrose is a 1-card Spheres!), but for consistency, Iâd likely add a copy of each Dragonmaid instead...? * Armed Dragon LV7, LV3, &amp; Flash with Twin Triangle are powerful but VERY clunky (fun tho) * Pile Armed Dragon is good but doesnât seem to have enough unique advantages over Darkflare in this build (currently. Will keep in mind) * Avoided Rokkets for a deckbuilding challenge, may optimized with it again soon * Removed Seyfert since this deck has plenty of normal summons &amp; already likes to search the small chaos dragons with Tempest, may consider 1 copy * Abhyss: could replace Halqi-Auroradon as a Nibiru back-up plan if drawn into * Stardust Synchron: could replace Halqi-Auroradon as a Nibiru back-up plan if drawn into, currently looking for ways to make &amp; destroy Chaofeng to search it (not necessary, just for curiosity) * Been thinking about adding Dogmatika+Shadolls * If anyone wants to shrink this deck size, Iâd recommend removing some of my combo pieces to build your deck with a Codebreakers and Phantom Knights engine  Hieratic Discord link: <a>discord.com/invite/rmdXrbX</a>  EXTRA DECK combo order: right-to-left for playtesting in EDOPro"

Uses Halq, Selene, Acesscode to end games. Doe","This is not a particularly optimized deck list for competitiveness, but it avoids alot of my feels bad moment like drawing 2 copies of the handtrap or some garnet and it doesnt play floodgates.  &nbsp;  3x Raye: It starts your engine and keeps it going.  3x Roze: Its extra copies of Raye that can occasionally help steal games. Can be bricky, but I prefer opening it with Raye then not having link access at all. It also helps in outing Dragoon by running over Verte and negating Dragoon, and then using Zeke/Afterburner to delay/remove threat.  3x Area Zero: Helps even out your hands, and a goodextender to close games.  3x Shark Cannon: Its graveyard disruption helps alot, and revive can leads to interesting game states.  3x Window Anchor: Disruption, and help close out games by attacking with the monster you steal.  2x Afterburner: Removal for chunky monsters. Feel free to use it as a way to pop Area Zero or using it on your own monster to get rid of a backrow.  1x Jamming Wave: Remove unknown backrow, but the non targeting destruction is also good.  1x Drone: Consistency Booster, might be used as a extender to link climb, but it haven't came up for me.  1x Eagle Booster: A really funny one-of, I use it to protect Shizuku in the end phase or Accesscode against Nibiru(Selene summoning veiler is the 5th summon tho) and during your opponents turn.  1xMultirole : Help clean up your MMZ, clear the way for your spells, and get tons of advantage.  2x Foolish Burial Goods: 3 is a bit too much since its HOPT, and it allows you to use Kagari without using Hayate. It also helps with the spell count in grave.  1x Metalfoes Fusion: There are a lot of ways to pop this, so drawing it doesn't hurt too bad, and it makes Foolish Burial Goods another way to draw Raye, and Area Zero into a +1  2x Pot of Desires: It's a really good card, but since the decks has 4 cycle cards, I feel comfortable with how much I see it. Also, its HOPT, and I dont like banishing 20 cards.  2x Forbidden Droplets: Dragoon out, and can fulfil the 3x spells in grave cost by sending the activated spells on the field as cost. The half attack is really neat. I play 2 because widow anchor does the same thing most of the time.  2x Ash Blossom: Disruption  2x Ghost Ogre: Disruption  2x Belle: Disruption  2x Veiler: Disruption, but also needed for the halq selene combo  1x Reinforcement of the Army: Find Raye or Roze  Terraforming: Extra Spells in the grave  Ice Dragon Prison: Dragoon out #3  Upstart: Free Spell  &nbsp;  Turn 1:  Objective: Not Die  Try to get a Sky Striker link on board, and set up your disruption.  Foolish Burial Goods to get a Anchor or a Shark Cannon, or Multirole if you can benefit from the resetting during the EP.  *If you have multirole, you can search Anchor during EP with Shizuku and use it on her to reset using multirole.  Turn 2-3:  Objective: Establish Parity and 3+ Spells in Grave  If you went first, try to disrupt your opponent so that that you will have Raye during the EP.  If you went second, try to break the board while making sure Raye stays in rotation. If you manage to establish 3+ spells in grave, use the additionally effects of Window Anchor to go into Zeke to remove 2 monsters. Make sure to chip in extra damage, since Accesscode can't kill them from 8000.  &nbsp;  Turn 3-4:  Objective: Establish a winning position  If its your turn, use the empowered effect of your spells to accelerate in card advantage or look for ways to get end the game. Look for stray tuners, and some combination of Window Anchor, Raye and Roze with Area Zero.  If its your opponent's turn, evaluate your cards in hand and consider saving cards like Widow Anchor and Shark Cannon to end the game. Acesscode talker can usually clear 4 cards easily, so letting them build a field might not be the worst idea if your Window Anchor and Shark Cannon can be used more aggressively.  &nbsp;  Turn 5+:  Objective: Win  At this point, multirole should likely be in play, and with 3+ spells in grave, each of your spells generate +2-3 card advantage. However, Sky Striker links are likely almost depleted, so make sure at all point to look for ways to kill your opponent. At I find 6 thousand life is my standard reach in most games. I can clear the board, Summon Raye and Roze, and pop Area Zero to get the 3rd copy, and deal 6k with Raye summoning the last striker link during combat.  &nbsp;  <strong>Cards to not run:</strong>  Scissor Cross: Its a neat card to play since it helps you end games way easier, but your most important objective is to survive turn 1-2 and let your cards out advantage your opponent. You can maybe consider cutting Roze for this Shizuku search as insurance, but it feels bricky and win more.  &nbsp;  Hercules Base: This gives the deck a great amount of grind, Kagari can recur this ad infinitum, but it doesn't help me survive when I need to, and I should be winning when Hercules Base is getting value.  &nbsp;  Utopia Double: I don't like Double or Nothing, loses to ash and desires.  &nbsp;  Pot of Avarice: It bricks turn 1, and it bricks when you don't have Raye. This is when you are most vulnerable, so I don't run it. It feels great when it resolves though.  &nbsp;  Toon Table of Content: Might be okay when it was MR4 with Toon Cyber Dragon and Engage, but getting 3 spells early isn't worth it for it.  &nbsp;  Dragoon: Its not fun for me or other people, and its bricky.  &nbsp;  <strong>Cards to Consider:</strong>  Cosmic Cyclone: Its difficult to get rid of face up spell and traps without waiting a few turns.  &nbsp;  Handtraps: They are mostly flex spots except for veiler, so feel free to swap those anytime.  &nbsp;  Borrelsword/Generic Link: Sometime I find myself with awkward amount of materials to link climb with.  &nbsp;  Relinquished Anima : Turns a level one into a spellcaster for Selene. It can be useful if you find yourself with crow in your hand or opponent's graveyard.  &nbsp;  Called by the Grave: Its good, but people really like playing Gamma.  &nbsp;  Triple Tactical Talent: Maybe for going second, but I am not sure how I feel about this.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Anyways, this is a Scrap Kaiju deck featuring Scrap Raptor, one of the best cards that Scraps have gotten in a long time. When I read Scrap Raptor's effects, I figured out that it plus Interrupted Kaiju Slumber or Scrap Factory can lead to an OTK. By himself, Scrap Raptor is a 1-card Avramax that was Link Summoned with I:P Masquerena!    &nbsp;  Anyways, this deck's whole goal is to go second and OTK. Because of Scrap Raptor's effects, you wanna draw this card or a card that searches it as often as possible. But if you have to go first, use Scrap Raptor's effects to summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax with I:P Masquerena.  &nbsp;  As for this deck's name, Â I named it after ""Godzilla Interception Operation Awaji"", a real-life tourist attraction on Awaji Island, Japan. Godzilla Interception Operation Awaji is part of the Nijigen No Mori theme park on said island. It comes with 4 main parts:   1. A theatre playing a short exclusive film. To keep with the theme of GIOA, those who come to it will be sent to the theater, where they will watch a 7-minute short film explaining why Godzilla is on Awaji Island. It also explains what the other parts are.   2. A Godzilla zipline and statue. Inside GIOA, there is a 65-foot/20-meter tall, 180-foot/55-meter long statue of Shin Godzilla with his mouth open. There are two ziplines which allow guests to actually glide in Shin Godzilla's mouth!   3. A shooting game. There's also a game in which people can pick up fake guns and shoot at Godzilla's cells.   4. The official Godzilla Museum. Godzilla Interception Operation Awaji has the world's first-ever permanent Godzilla-themed museum. The Godzilla Museum features dioramas of scenes from the films, as well as figures of the monsters, and material involving the Godzilla movies in general!  So if any of you plan on going to Japan once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, BOOM! Now you have a good reason to!"

You just need to summon <strong>Halq while having lv2 non-tuner in GY</strong>. Both Revealer of the Ice Barrier and Deep Sea Diva accomplishes it by ss-ing Hexa Spirit which then sends Prior (lv2 non-tuner) making us have 9 starters with Medallion Ice Barrier RotA.
