The Metalfoes are armed with an arsenal of alchemically-enchanted vehicles. From aurum ATVs to argent areial machines. By merging with their rides, these alloyed warriors are able to combat the dangerous dreadwyrm and aid the Dracoslayer in his quest to eliminate the eminating evils.

Burn up the Soul! Metalfoes Fusion!""

The Metalfoes are an interesting deck, being more of a Fusion deck that happens to sue Pendulum monsters. I would say that this would make them somewhat self sufficient and thus resilient to banlist hits...if not for the fact that one of the banned cards was Electrumite.

The general gist here is to use the monsters to create fusions and recur resources and then try to swing for game. Off-themed cards here include:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: Decent extender given the normal monster focus</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver"">Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver</a>: Which this isn't a pendulum deck per se (in terms of playstyle that is), it does still consist entirely of Pendulum monsters and is a Fusion deck so Vortex fits like a glove. Dissolver and Absolute offer ways to get to Vortex with the former properlly summoning it so that it can be revived if necessary and possible.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""GranSolfachord Musecia"">GranSolfachord Musecia</a>: Closest thing we got to Electrumite and while she can't get you draws she can at least offer some way of fixing scales once you used their effects.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Dowsing Fusion"">Dowsing Fusion</a>: more of a meme tech, but since we do play Absolute and since fusing from the hand from the other spells doesn't put them in the ED it is more likely to be live here compared to other Pendulum decks.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>, <a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a>, <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> and <a data-name=""Rescue Hamster"">Rescue Hamster</a>: Normal Monster support and pendulum support, though some do need you to already have a copy on hand to work.</li>
</ul>
The side deck is purely conceptual. That said with the advent of certain cards, <a data-name=""Engraver of the Mark"">Engraver of the Mark</a> might be a decent budget option. Other possible options include <a data-name=""Greater Polymerisation"">Greater Polymerisation</a> if you want Crimsonite to not be a Vanilla (wont work with the other ones), Some Rank 4s with Goldriver and Hamster/Rabbit (Vimana is out until there is a Level 5 in theme pendulum monster, and even then that is imcomptable with Rabbit) and a Magician engine with Chronogrpah is you want to play it like the average pendulum combo deck. Though I'm not sure if any of these suggestions are good."

One of the win conditions of the deck is of course <a data-name=""Odd-eyes raging dragon"">Odd-eyes raging dragon</a> the problem with that is ... handtraps .  The only thing i would change is maybe switch the dragons mirror for an <a data-name=""allure of darkness"">allure of darkness</a> and the ignister for an bls link or zefra link .

It easily synchro climbs into big boss monsters, but there is no nice guaranteed combo. Instead you're forced to rely on a little luck and some good deck building to make your huge boards. However, with that little bit of luck the deck can consistently put Apollo + 2-3 Synchros on the board at the end of turn 1. If you like negating effects a lot this might be the deck for you. It is very good at stealing Game 1s, but doesn't side deck that well. Anyways, let's get into the deck list.

We're a Sekka's Light deck. I didn't really have room to run a lot of spells and traps when I was near the end of deck building, and while you have to side this out often it seems too good to run a better Pot of Greed not to run it.

3 of each Adamancipator Tuner is essential to your deck. When things are going well for you the deck will use all 3 of these in a turn, and really to goal is to use as many of your ""monster maker"" cards in a turn as possible. I can't imagine the deck will ever run fewer than all 9 of these, they are your main starters, your best extenders, and the whole reason the deck is a deck. Rock goodstuff doesn't seem like a deck without them that's for sure.

3 Doki Doki. This is a great hit off of an Adamancipator, a good starter in its own right, and one of the effects you really want to go off in your turn. It's also nice to have level 2 non-tuners for Synchro climbing, and this is the best level 2 Rock monster that isn't a tuner.

We're running the Prank Kids engine to Link climb. One copy of Rocksies results in a Dodo-Doodle-Doo and a Rocksies on the field while adding 2 cards to your hand, one of which is a level 4 EARTH Rock monster, very relevant for some combo plays. What you do with those resources is up to you, but this is another one of those effects you want to get in a turn, and an amazing hit off of Adamancipators, and sometimes a decent starter in its own right. Dropsies and Fansies gives you a little bit of a buffer, and also gives you more ways to turn on your Risen Adamancipators.

Plaguespreader Zombie is a brick for Needlefibre, getting to Link climb into Needlefibre while generating the resources to Synchro climb is really quite good. This card also allows you to stack the top of your deck for your Adamancipator triggers etc, very useful actually, particularly since this deck doesn't require a lot of resources from the hand to combo off, but rather some luck in your hits.

Penguin Soldier is a brick for Penguin Brave, not much to say. You almost never summon this, but you want it for when you need it.

3 Koa'ki Meiru Supplier are our main extender, it's a level 4 EARTH Rock monster that special summons itself, so it's a no-brainer. You can do cool things with the Guardian it searches, so try not to forget this second effect.

3 Koa'ki Meiru Guardian are also obligatory. Hand traps are good, but being able to hit this really puts a hamper on them. The deck makes negates early to stop Nibiru quite easily. It also fills its hand with Rock monsters, so this card can often represent an additional negate. Usually if I hit 7+ negates it is because of a copy or two of this card. Can be a decent normal summon sometimes too.

3 Tackle Crusader. We need level 4 EARTH Rock monsters for the deck. This one does something if you're going second, probably wouldn't be playable in usual circumstances but the deck necessitates a high density of Rock monsters which means we run this card.

1 Gate Blocker, run for the same reasons as above, the absence of playable rock extenders leaves me running any trash that could have upside. Does protect Apollo from Imperm among other things, so this card feels pretty good when it is good.

1 Weeping Idol. It is the wrong attribute, but it is mostly a generic rock extender, and it gives us a fourth level 2 which is actually pretty useful.

3 Madolche Petingcessoeur. It's a generic level 4 extender, run whichever one of those you think has the least downside. I think it is this one, though it does sort of limit you from playing hand traps, so the plan is to side these out when you need Ash.

3 Tenyi Spirit - Adhara. It's a generic tuner you can special summon. Your biggest turns require a little luck and starting with these and and the Madolche monster. It basically only makes Needlefibre, but you want to make Needlefibre, so it is good enough given the limited space Rock monsters occupy. Also not a rock, oh well.

3 Nib. It has fringe advantages over other hand traps in the deck, and is usually high impact in the matchups you need hand traps most. There isn't really space for hand traps in the deck, but we need as many playable Rock monsters as possible and this is, in fact, one of them.

&nbsp;

In the Extra Deck, we have the Prank Kids engine to ""turn on"" Rocksies. Pretty self explanatory, generate a bunch of resources off of one hit. We have Apollo - you're almost always trying to end on this to pile the negates on, very important. We have the two playable Risen Adamancipators - Raptite is occasionally an extra interruption, and a half decent one, but is mostly just an engine card that gives you an extra Adamancipator effect in a turn. Unlike the tuners, it can hit the tuners, so it is pretty decent. Dragite helps break boards and also helps pile on spell negates, and is also important just for being an Adamancipator monster. You try and make this before Apollo to protect her from Imperm. Needlefibre summons Plaguespreader Zombie while link climbing which is important to your combo. Herald, Savage, and Crystal Wing are all your generic boss monsters you make to set up negates. Penguin Brave is interesting in the deck for a couple reasons. You need another Synchro 6 to make for Synchro climbing, if possible it should generate resource, and if possible it should serve as an interruption. Prenguin Brave happens to do all of that pretty well. Sometimes you have to mind your zones and not summon a Penguin with it, and you're mostly just trying to climb it into an 8, but it isn't bad as an interruption in a pinch. Gallant Granite searches you an Adamancipator monster, usually Researcher, helping turn 2 level 4s into Needlefibre + an Adamancipator effect, very relevant to trying to activate all 4 Adamancipator effects in a turn. Abyss Dweller is a good floodgate and worth running for GY matchups. Accesscode and Unicorn are to break boards going second as well as for follow-up plays. I:P is only okay in this deck, but helps put up an extra interruption when your materials don't Synchro together.

&nbsp;

Side decking is weird for this deck. You need a mass of Rock monsters, you want your extenders, and Sekka's Light and the Madolche monster kind of narrow your plays down. You mostly don't really want to side, which makes the deck a lot worse in Bo3. Still, there are a few packages I wanted to run. 3 Anti-Magic Arrows and 1 Red Reboot are here for trap decks - you can absolutely break an average trap board after using anti-magic arrows, and as we don't run other spells and traps aside from the Sekka's Light it is easy enough to side Sekka's light out and just blow out the trap deck. Gamma is a good high-impact hand trap that is fairly generic and doesn't put monsters in the GY for the Madolche monster, so I think these are kind of a must-run. The rest is a crapshoot. I decided DRNM is a good emergency card to have against combo, then I slammed in Ash and Imperm for some more good generic cards you can add in to increase hand trap density if that plan makes the most sense."

Note that this deck is not very viable in tournaments an,"My first ever decklist!

Someone on Dueling Nexus asked me for this decklist, so I've decided to make one on YGOProDeck. This deck can reliably get out an Borrelend Dragon + a dark level 8 Synchro of your choice while remaining cheap (~$87 on TCGPlayer with a $20 Borrelend for a total of $108). Note that this deck is made as an fun deck for local plays, although you can ""competitively"" play this against top decks by adding staples, expensive cards and a proper side deck.

<strong>Card choices, basic combos &amp; Alternatives</strong>

-3x Black Metal Dragon: Your best starter. Normal summon, then link it into Striker Dragon to add BSL &amp; Darkness Metal. Banish Striker Dragon for Darkness, reborn Black Metal then link into Romulus. Add Dragon Ravine ( or Divine Lance for a free dragon if you already have Tracer in your starting hand) and Wyvern as discard fodder (sometimes synchro material with Romulus' effect). Special summon Tracer (and possibly another Rokket) using your BSL and work toward an Borrelend Dragon + Tracer using Elpy, Quadborrel and Dillingerous Dragon. If you've used Tracer's effect before, use Borrelend to reborn your level 4 Rokket is always an option, but I usually save it for something like an Shelrokket or Silverrokket.

x1 Magnarokket/Shelrokket/Silverrokket/Anesthrokket Dragon: Fun cards, although gimmicky to resolve. Magna provides non-targeting removal, Shel literally ""shoots"" your opponent's monster with an interesting ""fragmentation"" effect, Silver can sometimes win you the game (by banishing your opponent's single copy of Meow-Meow-Mu, etc) and Anes as a free negate. They all float into other Rokkets during the End Phase, providing you the ability to push for game using Borrelsword or powerful level 8 Synchros such as Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. Always replaceable with hand traps if you already have them.

x2 Rokket Caliber: Nice extender that gets your Rokkets in position, also is a free level 4 tuner. This card haven't been released in the TCG though. If released, I think that it won't really change the $108 price of our deck as a common in BODE. (Seriously, I pulled a playset without spending more than ~$5 on 3 packs.) Ditch it for other cards if other players insult you for playing an OCG card.

x3 Forbidden Chalice: Budget replacement of Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet. Swap them out if you already have one of those expensive cards.

x1 Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend: You won't be using this card regularly, but sometimes this can be more than enough to ruin your opponent's day. Board wipe + Burn, also has nice interactions with Borreload Dragon.

1x Beelze: Fun to beat your opponent.

1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi: Your worse but cheaper Borrelsword.

1x Firewall eXceed: Can become a cheap 5k beatstick.

-If you have the financial ability, go for 3x <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>+ 1 each of Nibiru and Ash Blossom. This deck dies to Nibiru and Ash and a single copy of Called By The Grave isn't going to help. (If you're broke like us Vietnamese duelists, use proxies to play with your friend. A $100 card is about 1/4 the average monthly salary of us.)

Thanks for reading this! Hope you enjoy dueling with my decklist!

Post-Script: Sorry for my broken English ;-; I'm not very good at writing long guides.

UPDATE: Ditched the Chaos Ruler for an Borreload Savage.

<span>Lo que tenemos aquí, es un mazo con el que estrategias tipo combo, que necesitan dejar dejar un campo bien establecido o generar/reciclar recursos para poder avanzar en el duelo ven truncados sus esfuerzos. Esto es gracias a que el mazo ya sea siendo turno 1 o 2 tiene bastantes posibilidades de darnos algunos problemas durante nuestros turnos (si no tenemos cartas muy especificas dentro de nuestra estrategia para evitarlo), ya que la cantidad de interrupciones, floodgates y recursos que puede generar son bastante potentes.</span>

<span>Cartas como <strong><span><em>Dimension Shifter</em></span> </strong>y <em>Macro Cosmos</em>, provocan que cualquier estrategia que necesite recursos en cementerio (Drytron, Tri-Brigade, PK, entre otros), no logren hacerse con ellos para continuar sus jugadas o reciclar recursos.</span>
<span>Así mismo el control que le generan cartas como <em><strong><span>Thunder King Rai-Oh</span></strong>, <strong><span>Inspector Boarder</span></strong>, <strong><span>Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</span></strong>, <strong><span>There Can Only Be One</span></strong> y <span><strong>Summon Limit</strong></span></em><span><strong>,</strong></span> son bastante útiles, pues todas ellas afectan directamente al oponente. </span>

<span>Del lado de las trampas que ayudan a controlar un poco mas el juego de nuestro oponente tenemos <strong><span><em>Crackdown</em></span></strong>, para robarle un monstruo (starter o extender y de ser posible monstruo jefe) a nuestro oponente e interrumpir sus jugadas; también tiene a su disposición  <span><strong><em>Solemn Judgment</em></strong></span> y <span><strong><em>Solemn Warning</em></strong></span> que junto con <em>Thunder King Rai-Oh</em> evitaran cualquier Special Summon de nuestro oponente, aún si no tenemos a <em>Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</em> en el campo; siendo de todas ellas Solemn Warning la que representa un mayor problema, ya que esta niega invocación Normal, Flip (lo que es bastante útil ya que hay monstruos que requieren hacer flip una vez colocados para activar sus efectos) y por ultimo pero no menos importante niega Special Summon tanto inherente (<em>Cyber Dragon</em>, <em>Kaijus</em>, <em>Pankratops</em>, etc.), como asistida (<em>Monster Reborn</em>, <em>Tri-Brigade Revolt</em>, <em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>, <em>Nibiru</em>, etc.).</span>

<span>Para la generación de recursos en caso de no tener una mano tan favorable tenemos las ollas indicadas para esta estrategia que son <strong><span><em>Pot of Desires</em></span></strong><span><span>, </span></span><strong><span><em>Pot of Extravagance </em></span></strong>y <strong><span><em>Pot of Duality</em></span></strong>, siendo Desires y Extravagance quienes potenciaran al monstruo jefe de esta estrategia <strong><span><em>Gren Maju Da Eiza</em></span></strong>, el cual recordemos que se suma 400 ATK/DEF por cada carta baneada (nuestra), y Duality la cual nos puede dar el robo que necesitamos sin arriesgar mucho pues no requerimos tanto la Special Summon.</span>

<span>Ahora bien el Extra Deck tiene 2 funciones, siendo de las principales pagar costo de Extravagance e <strong><span><em>Eater of Millions</em> </span></strong>los cuales requieren banear boca abajo, exclusivamente del Extra Deck. La segunda función viene de la mano de <span><strong><em>Gizmek Orochi</em></strong></span>, que aunque no nos podemos hace de él mas que robandolo; si se tiene el suficiente control en el juego, a la larga podremos hacernos con hasta 2 de ellos en el campo e ir por los <strong>XYZ</strong> que necesitemos según la situación, si necesitamos quitar algún monstruo molesto que no pueda ser destruido por efectos o sea intargeteable, tenemos a <strong><em>Dingirsu</em></strong> o si queremos ir por el OTK tenemos el <strong><em>combo Draglubion</em></strong>, el cual solo se puede detenido si el oponente tiene algo que niegue efectos sin hacer target.</span>

<span>Para finalizar en el Side Deck vemos una carta bastante interesante <strong><span>Super Polymerization</span></strong>, pues con ella podemos deshacernos de algunos monstruos del oponente que representen algo con lo que no podemos lidiar tan fácilmente, esto lo logramos gracias a que por lo regular nuestros oponentes siempre trataran de ir por el duelo y dejar al menos 3 monstruos; y si es el caso que robamos o tenemos en mano <strong><span>Instant Fusion</span></strong>, esto nos facilita un poco lograrlo pues podemos invocar <span><strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict</strong></span> y con ello conseguir el monstruo que nos pudiera faltar; pero si nuestro oponente no esta listo , podemos equiparnos un monstruo suyo con Thousand-Eyes, despues podemos traer <strong><span>Relinquished Anima</span></strong> con Thousand-Eyes asi ya le enviamos un monstruo al GY a nuestro oponente y con Relinquished Anima le robaremos un segundo monstruo, para así cerrar con Super Polymerization y quitarnos el resto que pudiera tener en campo.</span>

<span>Para conocerlo mejor, solo descargarlo y pruebalo en tu app/programa para jugar YGO! en linea.</span>

<span>Nos vemos y..., Buen Duelo.</span>"

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Card by Card Explanation:</strong></h2>
<span><strong>Starters</strong></span>

The two main starters of the deck are Live☆Twin Lil-la and Live☆Twin Ki-sikil. It is preferable to start with Lil-la if possible, as it gives you access to Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost, a card with a useful GY effect. You want to prioritise opening with whichever Twin whose matching extender you have access to, to ensure you're able to play through interruptions such as Ash, Veiler or Imperm.

<span><strong><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la"">Live☆Twin Lil-la</a></strong></span>

One of the two starters in the deck, if possible start with Lil-la as you'll gain access to Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost's GY effect.

<span><strong><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Ki-sikil"">Live☆Twin Ki-sikil</a></strong></span>

The deck's other starter, you'll start with this if you do not have access to Lil-la.

<span><strong>Extenders</strong></span>

The extenders are your tools for if your opponent tries to interrupt your plays. They allow you to continue your combo through your opponent's disruptions and are a large consistency boost in achieving your end board.

<strong><span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat"">Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat</a></span></strong>

The matching Twin for Ki-sikil, she's the weaker of the two Twin extenders, due to her underwhelming GY effect, her main purpose is to act as an extender.

<span><strong><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost"">Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost</a></strong></span>

The matching Twin for Lil-la, her GY effect is very useful, banishing herself from the GY to draw a card if your opponent adds a card from their Main Deck to their hand.

<strong><span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Home"">Live☆Twin Home</a></span></strong>

Very versatile card, it can be used as a starter, or as an extender that can summon either twin from deck. This card will lock you to Live☆Twin monsters which will lock you from certain extra deck plays.

<span><strong>Utility</strong></span>

These are the other archetypal cards that boost consistency and have other benefits.

<span><strong><span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch"">Live☆Twin Sunny's Snitch</a></span></strong></span>

The archetypal ROTA, it searches any Live☆Twin monster.

<span><strong><a data-name=""Secret Password"">Secret Password</a></strong></span>

Secret Passcode is a very flexible searcher that can add any archetypal Spell/Trap to hand.

<strong><span><a data-name=""Evil&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;★Twin Challenge&lt;/span&gt;"">Evil<span>★Twin Challenge</span></a></span></strong>

This card functions similarly to Call of the Haunted. It lets you recover from losing Evil<span>★Twin's </span><a data-name=""Trouble Sunny"">Trouble Sunny</a> during your opponent's turn by reviving Evil<span>★Twin Ki-sikil.</span>

<span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>

<span><b><a data-name=""Evil&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;★Twin Ki-sikil&lt;/span&gt;"">Evil<span>★Twin Ki-sikil</span></a></b></span>

One of 2 link 2s the archetype has at its disposal. Ki-sikil's quick-effect allows her to revive a Lil-la monster from the GY, this allows her to revive Evil<span>★Twin Lil-la in order to pop a card on field.</span>

<span><b><a data-name=""Evil&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;★Twin Lil-la&lt;/span&gt;"">Evil<span>★Twin Lil-la</span></a></b></span>

The other part of the Evil<span>★Twin pair. Lil-la's quick-effect allows her to revive a Ki-sikil monster from the GY, this allows her to revive Evil★Twin Ki-sikil in order to draw one card.</span>

<span><b><a data-name=""Evil&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;★Twin's Trouble Sunny&lt;/span&gt;"">Evil<span>★Twin's Trouble Sunny</span></a></b></span>

The boss monster of the deck. Sunny has the quick-effect to tribute itself to revive a Lil-la and Ki-sikil monster from the GY, this allows you to activate the trigger effects of both link 2s to pop a card on field and to draw one card. This effect can be used during the battle phase which nets you a potential 5500 points of damage, you can then re-link both link 2s into a Sunny in Main Phase 2 to maintain disruption on your opponent's turn. Sunny's GY effect sends one Evil<span>★Twin monster from your deck, field or hand to the GY to remove a card from the field. It's important to note that this effect does not target or destroy therefore it can bypass pseudo-towers cards like Dragoon. The send target for this effect is the main deck Evil★Twins Ki-sikil Lil-la.</span>

<span><strong><a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a></strong></span>

Abom is a powerhouse card in the deck, its ability to pop extra cards as well as pop a card in the End Phase allows you to pop a potential 3+ cards per turn when used in conjunction with the effect of Evil<span>★Twin Lil-la.</span>

With 2 of each of the Onomat trio, Utopic Onomatopoeia, Gagagacoat, and Gogogoglove, 3 Utopic Astral Hope, 3 Astral Kuriboh, and 2 ZS - Ascended sage, you have all you need for a great rank 4 engine. The onomat trio, when all 3 are on the field, are essentially 6 lvl 4s. The basic combo with these guys is:

Summon Utopic Onomatopoeia, use effect, Glove and Coat, xyz with Glove and Utopic for utopia double, double detach glove, go into Leo, Leo effect, detach Utopic, equip Twin Saber. Then you use Coats effect, to revive Utopic. And gloves effect to revive itself. Then you xyz (any materials) into ZS - Utopic Sage. You then use Sages effect, ss Ascended sage from the deck. Ascended sage with the left over lvl 4, and here's where you make a decision. 1 Decision goes into utopia, ending on a utopia dragner with 4 materials, or a utopic Draco Future. For the Dragner Route, you go into Utopia with Ascended and the left over lvl 4. Use Ascended (Technically Utopia, since Ascended gives it an extra effect) to search Hyper Rank Up Magic Hope Force, then (NOT USING HYPER) summon Utopia Prime, then use the Rank Up Magic to go into a Utopia Dragner. Then use Dragner, detatch any 2 materials, summon Hope Harbinger (Don't use Hyper Rank Up Magics Gy Effect.) Then, during the opponents end phase, you can use Dragner to summon Heart-eartH Dragon, using Hyper Rank Up's gy effect, to attack itself to it. Then you can use Heart-eartH to banish all of the opponents monsters. Only do this if you plan for an OTK Next turn. Now, for the Utopic Draco Future Route, use Ascended Sage and the leftover lvl 4 to go into Gagagaga Magician, then use Gagagaga Magician with the ZS - Utopic Sage to go into Utopic Future (Only those 2, the monsters on Gagagaga are detatched), then go into Utopic Draco Future. The Route with Dragner ends of 2 Monster negates, and 1 spell negate, and at the ep, banish all of your opponents monsters. With the Draco Future, 3 Monster negates, with the added benefit of taking control of the opponents monster when you negate it on the field with Draco Future.

&nbsp;

And good morning, that was very tiring to read, wasn't it. Well there's more. great... Luckily it's only about 4 cards. The first is Zexal Entrust. This one is just when you need another target to search with Utopic Astral Hope. Basically a fallback. Feel free to remove it, but sometimes it's decent. The 2nd is Chain Summon. This is another one of, just like Entrust. It's for when you got enough cards to go into the Dragner Route, and when you still have enough space, you can use chain summon to summon Utopic Future, since there's no requirement for summoning and it's a rank 1. The 3rd card is Numbers Protect. This is also just another searcher for Utopic Astral hope, really powerful, Omni Negate, definitely a keep. The last card is Zexal Construct. This card is more used to unbrick your hand. In a lot of cases, you may draw cards you don't want to. Those 3 cards are the 2 Double or nothings, and Pegasus Twin saber. Construct sends a card from your hand to the deck, then adds one of a few Utopic Support cards. Most of the time you'll search a ZW, like Tornado Bringer. This combined with the normal combo lines and it being a searchable way to unbrick your hand (Utopic Astral Hope) is AMAZING. And for the Droll &amp; Lock Bird, you can replace that for your hand-trap of choice."

Why just the two Tenyi Adhara how do you use them? They are not used as an syncrho engine like in other decks but for consistency and recursion they can either be used for verte material turn one or most likely and frequently to banish and recur a banished wyrms, but how? well the tokens are non effect monsters use adhara to reclaim monsters of choice from banished perhaps chosen by your grand sword master previously.

Why the Pheonix enforcer? ecclesia recursion from gy and well its just powerful too.

Why so many Iris? Surprisingly comes in useful more often than you might imagine negation hate from yourself and enemy as well lv8 more on that later.

Why the number 100 package? Very easily accessed otk monster in an lvl 8 spam synchro deck also can use harbinger by itself if need more negation.

Why Chaos? Good xyz material discard extender and the extended

Why so strong on the Desires? One of the few decks it can benefit from both the banishes and draws for example Grand Duke, only thing that desires can potentially put an outright end to if unlucky is killing fusion destiny by banishing its targets

The decks primary combos are straight forward

Dragon Sword + any Wyrm/Swordsoul // Dragon sword in hand add Tai A, summon Tai A banish Dragon sword summon token making either yang zing synchro Tai A send Mo Ye, yang zing sacrifice summon Mo Ye reveal swordsoul or wyrm summon token, synchro grand sword master (atm dont get Mo Ye +1) add tactician send sword soul for tactician for ss summon token make any L10 synchro you wish (based on hand may wish to use search for trap/spell or even banish)

As for those like me who aim to make the deck when the cards are availible yes the tech choices are expensive but very very very easily substituted dont need verte only for consistency on pheonix and most hand traps and coounter traps can be swapped for basic floodgates other tech choices and engines a great thing about swordsoul you can play literally any tech choices because its own engine is so consistent and not particularly reliant on anything but desires may be important for boosting consistency through its ratios."

The strategy consists in focus your normal summons only on Resonators to ensure you to have <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a> on field. (that's why i maximized Chain Resonator instead of Synkron). The Inca engine is a ""1"" card special summon and allows you to have a dark dragon synchro on field nor just a synchro to trigger Chain's eff (it discards a card but searches 1 from the deck, baits Ash and works as an extender as well, since you have a Resonator name on grave). It's a cheap version of the deck i hardly recommend you guys to use Ancient Pixie Dragon and Chaos Ruler Dragon (this one is insane with Ascator, Dawnwalker) instead of Exploder Dragonwing and Beelze."

Megaliths are one of my favorite archetypes in this game because the concept of a ritual archetype with only ritual monsters is the kind of innovation that makes this game fun. They are also extremely cheap, you can pick up a full megalith core for under 20$ and you can easily get this deck down to 150$ or less by cutting the expensive extra deck monsters like Zeus and Accesscode. They are nice to have, but not mandatory by any means. Also you can nuke your opponent on their turn which is just sick.

<span><strong>Card Breakdown</strong></span>

3 Megalith Phul - This is the single best card in the entire archetype. It does literally everything you can want a card to do within reason. It recurs a ritual monster on summon to lessen the impact of the card deficits that are inherent in ritual summoning while also modulating its level for XYZ plays. Its second effect is even better, allowing you to ritual summon a monster from the deck at spell speed 2. This is insane. You get to special summon a monster from the deck, which is one of the strongest things you can do in this game because it is both searching and field presence, and it being spell speed 2 allows you to bring out Megalith Bethor on your opponent's turn to pseudo-nuke them in the middle of their combo. This guy is both your starter and your ender in most of the 2-3 card megalith combos and it carries the entire archetype on its back.

3 Megalith Ophiel - Ophiel mostly facilitates consistency by searching a Megaltih (usually Phul, but sometimes hagith) and then using itself as the material to summon them. Its also useful in a few combos where you could already search a megalith but using Ophiel as a middleman will make the end result better, usually by giving you an extra Bethor pop or Letting you use Phul's on summon effect to make it level 4.

3 Megalith Hagith - Hagith is the megalith backrow searcher, and while there isnt much of it, its still good enough to be worth searching. You can run 2 Hagith but from my experience you are pretty happy to see this in your opener so its worth the third copy.

2 Megalith Bethor - Bethor is the biggest playmaker Megaliths have. It essentially field nukes your opponent on summon which is always a welcome effect in any deck. It can brick your hands though because it relies on the other megaliths to set it up, so running 3 is not advised.

2 Megalith Aratron - Aratron used to be one of the best cards in the deck because of the hand trap ritual summon but since the block dragon ban finding the resources to use it effectively has become significantly harder. Its still worth playing because it offers solid protection and recycling for your other Megaliths and the spell speed 2 ritual summon can save you in a pinch, but its not the staple it used to be.

3 Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands -  Megaliths don't have a normal summon in their archetype so playing ritual monster stratos is a great boost to consistency and being level 4 makes it useful for XYZ plays with Phul.

3 Senju of the Thousand Hands - Megaliths don't have any ritual spells so Senju is effectively identical to Manju and its worth playing for the same reasons.

8 hand traps - I'm going to break my own unofficial rules here and just say you can run any 8 hand traps by preference. Outside of Nibiru which is risky to run maindeck none of the hand traps have that much synergy with Megaliths so just play whatever.

3 Megalith Unformed - The first effect of Unformed is barely ever relevant but that doesn't matter because the second effect boosts consistency and allows you to start your plays without a level 8 Megalith. Its also an important part of the decks best combos.

3 Dark Ruler No More - It breaks boards going second like nothing else and this deck can't really afford to discard for things like Forbidden Droplet or Super Polymerization. Run this or get steamrolled by Drytron :/

3 Pot of Desires - You only have 2 one-of engine pieces so 3 desires is a no-brainer.

2 Cosmic Cyclone - Cyclone is mostly here to out annoying floodgates like There Can Be Only One and -ugh- Mystic Mine.

1 Treacherous Trap hole - This is for Rafflesia, as a pro tip don't XYZ summon Rafflesia until after you activate Pot of Desires and confirm that this isn't banished.

1 Megalith Emergence - This is what you usually search off Hagith because you can use Emergence to summon a Phul from grave which can use its effect to summon Bethor to nuke your opponent at spell speed 2. After that it gives you a solid grind game.

<span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>

1 Abyss dweller - Its a good floodgate XYZ monster to end your combos on.

1 Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer - Its Castel, this deck can make a rank 4. This bird person was a knightmare before knightmares were a thing.

1 Traptrix Rafflesia - Another rank 4 option to end on, popping 2 cards by sending Treacherous Trap Hole is a very strong disruption but if you can already make a spell speed 2 Bethor it can be a little redundant.

1 Baguska, the Terribly Tired Tapir - The ultimate stalling tactic for rank 4 decks everywhere. If your opponent is winning, make baguska and try to topdeck DRNM.

1 Gallant Granite - Usually not as good as the other rank 4s but its nice to have around because the search can unclog you draws, with megaliths needing at least 2 card to do anything and all that.

1 Number 97: Draglubion - Megaliths can also make rank 8 somewhat easily which makes a Draglubion engine pretty good here as a negate and beatstick or as an otk.

1 Number 100: Numeron Dragon -  For Draglubion.

1 Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy -  For Draglubion.

1 Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder - Its zeus in a deck that can make XYZ monsters. It can be a bit redundant with Bethor, But again, its Zeus.

1 Knightmare Phoenix - Its a knightmare.

1 I:P Masquerena - I had some extra deck space free so i just threw this in because we are playing knightmares. You almost never make it but its there.

1 Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos -  Its really funny to just slam this absolute beast down on someone who forgot to put a dragoon out in their deck and watch them lose.

1 Knightmare Unicorn -  Okay i should probably explain why extra deck monsters with removal effects are so good for the sake of clarity and newer players. Having an answer to your opponent's most threatening cards in the forever accessible extra deck completely removes the luck aspect from whether you can remove things, which is a pretty big deal because then you don't have to play cards like Raigeki so that you have access to removal.

1 Accesscode talker - Having accesscode in your extra deck means you can always generate a ton of damage to otk your opponent and that's why its 100+ dollars and played in basically everything.

1 Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess - Its the best link monster that has the word negate on it, and while again its usually better to just make an XYZ, having it doesn't hurt.

The first combo is the following:

 	<li>Activates photon sanctuary to summon your tokens and link them into summoner;</li>
 	<li>Normal summon your thunder monster;</li>
 	<li>activates ties of the brethren by targetting your thunder monster on your field (Here you will summon solar and a floodgate, if if have terminal world, activate it first and summon lightning rod lord, if not summon rai-oh, them dump the other floodgate with solar effect);</li>
 	<li>During your opponent turn activates summoners effect, discard a card to summon the floodgate you dump with solar during your turn (if you draw one of the floodgates in your oppening hand, dump any other monster and when you activate summoners effect, discard your floodgate as a cost, them summon it from gy, cause you can summon the the monster you discard as a cost with summoners effect as long as you have another monster in your gy beforehand);</li>
 	<li>End board: summoner, rai-oh lightning rod lord and a thunder monster (this is at least cause you can have terminal world if you draw it or a handtrap).</li>
</ul>
The second combo is the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Open with pa/ma and another thunder monster (both monsters must have different names from each other and at least  one of them must be pa or ma);</li>
 	<li>Normal pa/ma;</li>
 	<li>activates ma/pa effect to normal your other monster;</li>
 	<li>Overlay both into utopia double;</li>
 	<li>Activates double effect to add double or nothing from deck and summon dragner;</li>
 	<li>Activates dragners effect to summon either hope harbing if youre going first or utopia beyond if youre going second;</li>
 	<li>Endboard: Dragner and hope harbinger or utopia beyond (this is again at least because you can have handtraps and other extenders).</li>

Para evitar llegar a esas fases del duelo, lo que buscamos es la rápida invocación en turno 2 o 3 de las fusiones por medio de la carta ""Power bond"" queriendo rematar al oponente normalmente con el ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" tras limpiar el campo con sus efectos, pero lamentablemente en la mayoría de casos no será suficiente. Para esos casos en los que el oponente logro defenderse exitosamente, ya estableció un campo que no podemos atravesar con fuerza bruta o de plano algún efecto nos frena. El objetivo será establecer nuestro propio campo 'defensivo' usando de diana a los dos monstruos XYZ ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"" junto a alguna fusión o link que logres agregar a las defensas para resistir lo mejor posible los turnos consecuentes.

Notas:
-Si bien el deck y el arquetipo en general no le gusta tomar el turno 1 del duelo, tiene los recursos para establecer su propio campo defensivo con el cual estorbar al oponente.
-Ninguna trampa es poco, 2-3 trampas es ideal, 5 es mucho.

Welcome to my Six Samurai deck profile! Today, I am going to explain to you how insane this deck really is. Trust no other Samurai deck than this. Any other Samurai deck profile is irrelevant! ^.^ Just kidding! haha.. ha.. But for real listen up yo -.- Do not underestimate the Power of the Samurai, you'll need an entire side deck dedicated to this matchup if you want to stop me :P

Anyway, Kageki and Kizaru 2 card combo is all you need to have a first turn full combo board. Or any spell card and 2 monsters. Or 2 bushido counter cards/spells and 1 monster. Or any 3 monsters. There are a few exceptions but usually, that's what it takes. Anything better than that, you can even play through some negates. Best 5 card hand would be Kageki, Kizaru, Gateway of the Six, Terraforming for Temple of the Six, and a Fire Flint Lady for protection or even another counter card. First turn board should go full combo almost every game, it's ridiculous.  This usually includes unlimited bushido counters on *up to*  4 spell cards, also Battle Shogun can have unlimited counters and your 1 field spell, temple of the six can have unlimited counters, reducing the enemies attack to nothing.

At the end of our first turn. monster/trap/spell/field spell/graveyard/deck/hand will look like this:

Battle Shogun of the Six, with unlimited counters(infinite attack damage). He will deal with high attack monsters.

Apollousa with at least 3200 attack. She will deal with effect monsters.

Naturia Barkion. He will deal with trap cards.

Naturia Beast. He will deal with spell cards.

Abyss Dweller. He will stop any hand traps or graveyard effects.

Grandmaster of the Six. Just a body to fill the last open monster row.

Imperial Order. This will deal with spell cards that Naturia Beast cannot negate, like Dark Ruler No More.

A field spell, Temple of the Six.

2 3 or 4 bushido counter cards on the field.

2o-25 cards in the graveyard.

10-15 cards left in the deck.

6 cards in hand.

&nbsp;

This deck is VERY consistent. You will end first turn with 20+ cards in the graveyard and about 10-15 cards left in your deck. I have drawn full combo 30 shuffles in a row. Still testing the accuracy and I have made some edits after posting this deck list. I added more temple of the six because it never feels like a brick. I have tested over 100 hands. Drawing 2 has never stopped me, it often helps. The deck is more consistent with 3 temple and 1 terraforming. The consistency is the best part about the deck, except the BEAST of a lockdown.

&nbsp;

I run 42 cards instead of 40 because there are NO cards that you specifically need to see in your opening hand. If you don't have Kageki and Kizaru there is no need to worry, there is at least 10 different ways to achieve the same result and you can still do full combo even without opening a single bushido counter card. If you do draw bushido counter spells, you can play through some negates. Temple of the six is amazing, almost as good as Shien's Dojo. Fire Flint Lady helps play through a negate as well. We can bait out a hand trap with Kageki and then go into Fire Flint Lady to continue our combo, so I run 3. Special summon Kizaru and use his affect to add Legendary Secret to the hand to later summon when we get Hatsume. There are a few garnets and other cards you would rather NOT see in your opening hand, so 42 cards help alleviate the ratios, better than a 40 card deck. I have a lower chance of drawing 2 equip spells in a 42 card deck compared to a 40 card deck. Even drawing just 1 of my 4 equip spells is a 1 in 10.5 chance in a 42 card deck. It is a 1 in 10 chance in a 40 card deck. The cards that you would rather not draw opening hand are Hatsume, Fuma, D.D.R., Living Fossil, Divine Sword Phoenix Blade and Infernoble Arms. It is 100% okay if you draw 1 equip spell, drawing 2 can slow you a bit but unless you have a horrible hand it should be okay. There are plenty of situations where drawing Hatsume and Fuma on the first turn is okay as well, but the main strategy is to special summon Hatsume from the deck by using Isolde, sending 3 equip spells to the graveyard. Use her first affect to add a Kageki to the hand. Then use her 2nd affect to summon Hatsume. Chain summon Legendary Secret of the Six Samurai or any other special summon.  Then summon it and Isolde away for Battle Shogun. We then discard 1 card, (the Kageki that we searched off of Isolde) and get Gateway of the Six. Then we use Hatsume's effect to special summon Kizaru from the grave. Search Mizuho with Kizaru affect and add to hand for later. We can then bring out another Battle Shogun for 3 more counters, we next get 2 Kizans special summoned and then we can XYZ for Shadow of the Six Samurai for 3 more counters.. Bring out more Kizans and Grandmaster. Go into a 4 link material Saryuja and draw some cards. Special summon Mizuho with Saryuja's next affect. Finally, we do the Mizuho and Shinai loop combo with Gateway and Battle Shogun. We can then go through everything in our extra deck including all 3 Saryuja summons on our first turn, drawing a ton of cards. We can use all 15 extra deck monsters in 1 turn, very easily if we are not stopped.. I'm talking almost every game, maybe 90% accuracy for full combo if they have no negates. Maybe a 50% chance if they do negate.

&nbsp;

Asceticism is great! It allows for a free special summon. We are trying to get as many free summons as we can. Not many people run it right now but it has never been a bad draw for me. It works with Fuma/Kageki, Grandmaster/Kizan, Hatsume/Mizuho.. Asceticism even works great with Legendary Secret of the Six Samurai. He can copy any samurai's attack power from the grave. So he can copy a Kizaru's attack, to special summon another Kizaru from the deck! It also works very well with Battle Shogun of the Six too because his attack is always changing depending on the number of bushido counters on the field, we can manipulate those counters with Gateway to Asceticism for Kizaru or anyone else. Asceticism works well with Divine Sword Phoenix Blade too, which boosts a monsters attack by 300. You can boost Hatsume or Mizuho to Asceticism for Kizaru! Asceticism is a great way to get Kizaru more active even if it doesn't appear that way at first because no other monsters have 1900 attack. Last, it works well with Gateway of the six, which can use 2 counters to give 500 attack to any samurai monster that you can then Asceticism with. Asceticism can be very good if you get creative with it, even if your deck isn't entirely built off of it. Right now I run 1 asceticism.

&nbsp;

Primathmech is used to search for Imperial Order or another spell if you already have it. The 3 Saryuja allows for a ton of draw power. 1 Battle Shogun is nice but 2 is needed for those final extra 3 bushido counters you need sometimes. Shadow of the Six xyz can get you 3 extra bushido counters. Crystron Halqifibrax ensures a way to get Shien's Squire in case you don't already have him. Shien's Squire allows for Naturia Barkion and Naturia Beast to come out. Basically, once your bushido loop combo is established, you have a way to search for everything you need. The important cards that are searchable are Shien's Squire, Imperial Order, Gateway of the Six, Kizan, Grandmaster, Mizuho and Shinai. You probably won't even need a Mizuho and Shinai combo to do a Gateway loop.

&nbsp;

The biggest weakness to this deck is Nibiru because of course it is. You would need 3 bushido counter cards with counters to play through a Nibiru and continue full combo. Also, if you can destroy my Gateway, I can't do the loops."

And Aleister,"I think this is an easy deck for newcomers to try and get caught up with Yugioh without getting completely stomped on. With the new tins coming out soon, the only expensive cards should be Invocation and Nadir. Dogmatika should drop drastically.

<em><strong>Strategy 1</strong>:</em> <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> combo into Shaddoll Winda on your opponent's turn. Mainphase, use Nadir, <strong>send</strong> <strong>Apkallone to graveyard</strong>, add and <strong>send Schism to graveyard</strong>. Activate Maximus's effect to banish and special summon from hand. Activate her effect to <strong>send Ash Dragon and Shaddoll Construct</strong> to graveyard. <strong>Activate Shaddoll Construct</strong> to add Prism trap to your hand and then set and pass turn. <strong>End Phase</strong>, activate Ash Dragon to <strong>add Dogmatika Ecclesia and special summon</strong>. Activate her effect to add Dogmatika Fleurdelis. Fleurdelis can be activated during your opponents turn to negate monster effects. <strong>Finally,</strong> activate Prism trap to special summon Shaddoll Winda.

<em><strong>Strategy 2: </strong></em>Summon Aleister the Invoker and activate effect to add Invocation to hand. Activate Invocation to go into any Invoked monster. Mechaba is good for negating anything if you have the right cards in your hands. The good thing about the Charmers is their attributes, which allows Aleister to go into what he wants.

Tips and Tricks:
<ol>
 	<li class=""engine-dark-box"">Grand Spiritual Art Ichirin can negate the first monster effect when you have a spellcaster with 1500def on the field. Dogmatika Ecclesia just so happens to be a spellcaster with 1500 def and is a powerhouse for the deck. If you already have Fleurdelis in your hand, that can give you 2 negates.</li>
 	<li>Possessed Partnerships can special summon Dogmatika Ecclesia to activate her effect and destroy one face up card on the field. You go +2 and can destroy one of your opponents cards.</li>
 	<li>Use Unpossessed in weird ways. You can ram your Jigabyte into your enemy to special summon Dogmatika Ecclesia from your deck. Ecclesia and Jigabyte's effects both activate giving you +2 card advantage.</li>
 	<li>The familiar combo. Battle Phase, ram Jigabyte into a stronger monster and destroy it, activate effect to special summon Ranryu from your deck. Ram Ranryu into the same monster to destroy itself and activate effect. Revive Jigabyte and ram into your opponent's monster again to special summon Inari Fire or Nefarious, depending on what you already have in your graveyard. Inari Fire and Nefarious have an endless loop where they can special summon themselves. The only way for them to be stopped is if they are banished or returned to hand or deck. <strong>Getting Inari Fire on the field while you have Nefarious in the graveyard is key. </strong>You don't want to use these two as tributes unless absolutely necessary. Once Inari Fire goes to the GY (Unless destroyed by card effect) it will never be reborn from the GY ever again.</li>
 	<li>Use Terraforming and Metaverse to bait hand traps.</li>
 	<li>If you draw both Spirit Charmers and Possessed Partnerships, discard Partnerships as you can revive your continuous spells and traps later on.</li>
 	<li>If you're playing against decks with different attributes, use the Link Charmer monsters to your advantage. Having both Awakening of the Possessed, Unpossessed, and Grand Spiritual Art make them invisible. And you get to special summon one of your opponents monsters from the GY. Pray you don't get feathered dustered.</li>
</ol>
Side Deck Tips
<ul>
 	<li>Trismagistus can special summon level 4 spellcasters, which Familiar Possessed meet.</li>
 	<li>I haven't tested Spiritual Light Art yet, but considering you do a lot of banishing extra deck monsters, this may be worth looking into. I assume you can special summon from either banished zone.</li>
 	<li>Use Dark Ruler No More to setup your board.</li>
 	<li>I forgot to sidedeck the Awakening of the Possessed but they should be worth looking into. If you do decide to add some of them, I advise to increase your deck size, to avoid drawing them on the first turn. At 40, I find I draw them too frequently (even just 1 in the deck). Bad luck perhaps.</li>

This deck is a going first combo deck focused on getting the Super Quant link monster out and a bunch of Super Quant XYZ monsters to cycle cards, with the option to go into a Great Magnus. </span>

<span>The main starters in the deck are Super Quantal Fairy Alphan, Super Quantum Blue Layer, One-for-one and Emergency teleport. By far the best normal/special summon in this deck is Fairy Alphan, as it allows you to essentially painful choice 3 Super Quantums from your deck, all of which have excellent floating effects. Foolish Burial can also be considered a starter since you can foolish Super Quantum White Layer to guarantee a Fairy Alphan. Unfortunately due to deck space limitations, it is not feasible to run more hand traps besides Ash without ruining the consistency of your plays. Since you will be discarding 5+ cards a turn, it is not ideal to run more hand traps that will inevitably shrink your resources and be discarded without any positive floating effects.</span>

<span>A 9-card danger package is run here because it synergizes very neatly with all of the Super Quantum floating effects, and can also provide as fodder for the link summon of the Super Quant link monster. All the Dangers in this deck also have ideal levels that make them great for XYZ summoning for the Super Quantum cards. Cards like Tsuchinoko and Nessie can go plus off of their own discard effects, and can also be selectively discarded with the use of the Super Quantal field spell, which is the main playmaker of the deck, and is the ideal search in this deck past Fairy Alphan.</span>

<span>Many of the Super Quant spells and traps were cut out because they are too slow and do not contribute to the combo potential of the deck. Conversely, spells such as Pot of Desires and Monster Reborn were added to increase the chances of seeing 3+ XYZ monsters and the link or link + Great Magnus turn one.</span>

Having the Danger! engine to dig deeper into your deck + obviously using your Chaos Beasts into getting your Sacred Beasts with the Fallen Paradise combo to dig ever deeper. Having Allure of Darkness is also incredibly helpful as well.

-<strong>The Main theme</strong> of this deck is to quickly draw into your key pieces, to get your combo going with Chaos Summoning or Dark Beckoning Beast. Having the ability to also Foolish Burial or One for One to discard cards to use them for their GY Effects (ie Banishing Dark Summoning Beast to get 1 Sacred Beasts from deck to hand or Banishing Chaos Summoning Beast to get 1 Fallen Paradise from deck to hand). The deck also utilizes Archnemeses Eschatos, Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair, Dark Armed Dragon and Chaos Daedalus incredibly well, since you can easily resolve their effects naturally, with the way the deck plays.

-You will have a graveyard full of dark monsters for your Dark Armed Dragon to be easily summoned, or even if not, you can banish monsters to reduce the size of your GY. The deck may face problems with backrow heavy decks  but Dark Armed Dragon + Chaos Daedalus can easily take care of that with banishing them instead of just destroying them, don't forget that Dark Armed Dragon can spam his banish effect as long as you have Dark monsters in your GY, which you will have plenty, thanks to the Danger! engine that we use.

-<strong>The Extra Deck</strong> utilizes the general staples you're most likely fond of seeing, ie Knightmare Unicorn, Knightmare Phoenix, also using Knightmare Cerberus which I feel people sleep on. Unchained Abomination and Saryuja Skull Dread both offer solid choices that you can pick from + having Pentestag is a nice bonus for piercing.
Barricadeborg Blocker and Salamangreat Almiraj both offer some decent utility, especially Almiraj, which can unbrick some shitty hands you may have. The fusions simply exist there as an option, but truthfully, you will rarely go into them, since we're using the Fusion spell once, even though you can search it. Armityle the Chaos Phantasm - Phantom of Fury is still pretty strong if you manage to resolve it. For the XYZ's, we use the Superdreadnaught package + Number 81, but you can easily remove Juggernaught Liebe with something else. Hieratic Sky Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis and Dark Armed, the Dragon of Annihilation are there as a choice, you can also replace any of those with Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star for example or any other staple Link Monster.

-<strong>The Side Deck</strong> is general staples which are there to simply give an idea of what you may want to use. Skill Drain is insane in this deck because you can play through it. You can add/remove things depending on what you face on your locals/friend group etc, the list is simply there as a general rule on what you can use, there are obviously more staple side deck cards which you can utilize, again, depending on what you see fit."

Here's a build with a few cards I don't often see played in Dragons. ,"<span>This deck is intended for online play where Borrelend Dragon is available.</span>

<span>I don't know why but I don't see many Dragon Link players finishing on <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a>. Granted it is a very high investment. But crucially it's not just a boss monster; it's an extender! This is hugely important for being able to go into BOTH Borreload Savage Dragon AND Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss on your opening turn. Use it's effect to negate one of your monsters that is going to be sent to the graveyard's effects and get a free Rokket from the Graveyard! </span>

<span>This deck can consistently finish on 3 big boys; Borrelend Dragon, then some combination of Borreload Savage Dragon, Zombiestein, and Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. You usually just need one starter and one extender to accomplish this. </span>

<span>Regarding Tripple Burst Dragon; I always go into it as a link climb into Borrelend Dragon as it's a great card to attach to Borreload Savage Dragon. </span>

<span>Some other cards I haven't seen played too often in Dragon Link, that are in here; </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Dragon Shrine + Galaxy Serpent + World Chalice Guardragon. This represents a free extender with some light attribute grave setup. And none of these cards are hard garnets: Dragon Shrine has other good targets, GS and WCG can both be discarded fodder or in an emergency normal summoned to be linked off into Striker Dragon if you don't have an available normal summon.  </span></li>
 	<li><span>Keeper of the Shrine. If you can get this into the GY before you use Rokket Tracer's effect you can use Tracer to destroy a Dragon rather than a spell card and get an additional level 4 body on board. </span></li>
</ul>
<span>Finally the deck count. I think going for higher deck counts (even 50+) works wonders for Dragon Link. You have so many great starter cards (and any normal summon is basically a starter with Striker Dragon) that having that higher deck count helps keeps garnets out of your opening hand. </span>
