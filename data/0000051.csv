What's new with cubics and how to run them? Right here folks.,"Well my friends, It seems that hell is serving ice water. After much hope, new cubic support has been revealed over the past few months. Here's to another year of <strong><em>dat cubic bullsh*t.</em></strong>  If you have absolutely no idea what I'm on about, please check out my previous <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/cubics-a-fundamental-guide/"">Cubic guide!</a>  Now that the fundamentals of a ""good"" cubic deck are in place, let's get right to the point. A new era is coming, yet Sky-strikers, Guardragon, and Salamangreat still rule the meta even after laughable banlist hits at the time of writing this. We live in a lawless land of board-state decks that rely on scummy combos to completely cheat a win out of abusing an opponent for a 15 minute turn one, just to have the only option being to scoop and go to game two.  Now some (maybe all) may be asking, ""what does this have to do with cubics, and why is this guy already wrong?"". Well, I have a snippet of great news that will bring a smile to any cubic player's face.  <em>Incoming destruction meta.</em>  Hakai? Destruction. Tenyi? Destruction and bounce. Marincess?...Stall?  Whatever, Nova will just whack over it eventually.  These decks may force out the three current giants, much to the benefit of cubic players. anyways, on with the show.  First up is the best cubic card released to date, <a data-name=""Cubic Dharma"">Cubic Dharma</a>, a continuous spell card. Hot damn, did someone say recursion? With this card you get consistent card draw and mill, along with a hilarious destruction effect that lets you <em>add</em> your cubic monsters back to your hand from grave. This can be very versatile, with access to <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>, <a data-name=""Dark World Dealings"">Dark World Dealings</a>, as well as just another copy of Cubic Dharma to send to grave and recover combo monsters in a pinch. Oh, and you can swing Vijams at face to put free counters and free up board space. A mandatory 3 of that should not be overlooked.  Next up is <a data-name=""Cubic Ascension"">Cubic Ascension</a>, a normal trap card. Since the new push of cubics is to use the counter play (heh) to brick your opponent's field, to support that strategy is this little morsel. Allowing you to dump vijams onto the field like your ex did to all of your belongings, this card helps IMMENSELY with the survivability of the deck with it's graveyard effect for mats and link fodder, as well as supplying an attack redirect for the clutch-bricking of a problem monster. Be careful though, this card can be a danger to brick with since it's on field usage is limited. I personally run two, since having 3 with no outlet is a bit risky. A really great card just for a bit of stun as well. Try splashing this in a stun deck with 3 vijams. The world is your metaphorical oyster.  Oh boy... the last one is kind of a doozy. <a data-name=""Cubic Omen"">Cubic Omen</a> is a normal trap card that places cubic counters up to the number of Cube boyes you control. Simple and painless if you want to keep this on the DL for that sicc battle phase fake out. I recommend not running this card if you aren't explicitly going for a ""brick house"" sort of build. The graveyard effect is... very transparent. It tells your opponent <em>exactly</em> what to remove, as well as being probably the <strong>only</strong> once-per-turn clause in the entire archetype. If, by chance, you can use it on Nova, do so after you've moved to battle phase. Don't embarrass yourself, kid. All in all, a pretty nifty card (it's support huzzah!). Run at 2 if you're building around it. Otherwise, don't clog your deck with too much of the archetype. Less is more.  Onto some newer cards and combos that may be of interest!  Ok so not that new, <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a> is a pretty neat extender, and a good use of the turn 1 Nova dump. It's a 2 for 2, but going even is better than going negative. Run at 2 if you find yourself with those frustrating multi-nova hands and nothing to do with it.  <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is at 2. Milk this for all it's worth while you can. Stuff a <a data-name=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a> and a <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> in that extra deck against those problem boards. I know you have room, punk. A great side option for the mirror, or even main deck if problem decks are all you face. <a data-name=""&lt;br /&gt;Dark Factory of Increased Production""> Dark Factory of Increased Production</a> is a pretty cheeky continuous trap that lets you pitch your dead monsters in favor of a draw. A little setup and patience, and you have an on board dark world dealings! Combined with the new support, this card is a good 2 of if it tickles your fancy. Can be kind of bricky if not ratio'd right, but still a funny option.  With more cubics being thrown onto the board, a good option to clear out an emergency is <a data-name=""Vulcan Dragni the Cubic King"">Vulcan Dragni the Cubic King</a>. Along with being searchable by <em>*cough*everything*cough* </em>a simple 1-of can help you clear out those 2 monster weird situations that may arise in a negated duza combo, as well as recurring 3 vijams to the field after battling, and searching out <a data-name=""Indiora Doom Volt the Cubic Emperor"">Indiora Doom Volt the Cubic Emperor</a> for an emergency restart to the duza combo.  Onto the extra deck, a clutch card that has won me a good few games is <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a>. All it takes is 1 vijam to take someone's <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>. Any upwards pointing link monster or even hastily placed main deck monster actually. A really clutch card on turn 3/4. Run 1 or 2 depending on the use you get out of it.  Run the knightmares. I don't care which ones or how many, but discard for an effect isn't a cost. It's advantage.  So one last hurrah, cubics got support. Thank you for coming by to check out this amalgamation of probably over-hyped support cards for an archetype that may-or-may-not be good on release written by a fanboy with delusions of grandeur.

It's best trying to have Crystron Smiger in your graveyard to banish it and tuto Crystron Impact. The good hands can go into Needlefiber + F.A Dawn Dragster. Needlefiber can summon Citree or Rion, most occasionnaly Quan, and just let it on the field because their effect will be no more negated during your opponent's turn. Finally the field spell can help to debrick a hand tributing monsters like Red Resonator to go on Junk Speeder and add disruption during your opponent's turn, possibly forcing him to waste one resource to handle it.  Now you can skip turn and use effects of your Crystron tuners to perform rapid synchros using your graveyard, your banishment or your hand depending the monster you use to summon things like Dragon Ogre Deity Of Tenyi, or Crystron Quariongandrax to have more negation or disruption. Then activate the quick effect of Needlefiber and finish on Stardust Warrior to pressure your last opponent's resources. Depending the board of your opponent, Crystron Needlefiber can go to Formula to draw 1, T.G Wonder Magician to pop the backrow or Shooting Riser Dragon to better adapt to your opponent's board and foolish a crystron to gain more effects during your second turn.  If you have to go second, you can just spam the field with your monsters effects and try to break inside opponent's board with the powerfull effects of Quariongandrax, Deity and Phoenix against more defensive builds.  Basically, synchro summon monsters with great disruptive effects during your opponent's turn following his deck and board can completely shut down some decks. Quariongandrax has an excellent match up against decks like True Draco that can't interract with banished cards and all Guardragons variants since you can completely stop the loop by striking key link monsters. Phoenix can completely shut down Sky Striker and Trickstar's turn by banising all spell and trap cards on opponent's field and graveyard when summoned, that can be deadly if there aren't widow anchor or if you have Dragster's effect to back up Phoenix. Phoenix is equally good against going second Orcust since it can banish all the backrow and prevend Fog Blades to activate from the graveyard, and generally can disable the whole Orcust part of hybrid builds that often runs only one field spell. Finally Stardust Warrior is good against one monster focused decks like the new cyberse Processlayer archetype since it can simply stop a turn, and is generally a good way to handle the last resources of more stable decks. If Stardust Warrior is negated by the opponent and has to leave the field, you can directly summon a Jet Warrior from the extra deck and bounce a card of the field.  Don't forget that depending the build of the field, during your second turn you can trigger Crystron Sulphafnir from your hand or graveyard and directly destroy Crystron Phoenix or Crystron Quarionguandrax to free extra or link zones and activate their second effects to reform a board or just allow an OTK.  &nbsp;  Now the side deck  Borreload and Borrelsword can be added cutting one needlefiber and Junk Speeder since Needlefiber can be summoned by Crystron Impact and Junk Speeder is just a way to assure boards under bricks or negations of hand traps. Borreload is a good way to break through unaffected monsters, especially ones like Blue-EyesChaos Max that is'nt summoned from the extra deck and is counted as a tribute summon, going through Stardust Warrior's effect, and being huge Beatsticks. Borrelsword sets up solid OTKs against decks with a lot of resilience.  To better handle backrow decks that can be annoying while going second, we run Twin Twisters that are reallygood in this deck since you can pop 2 cards and discard Crystron monsters to facilitate the preparation of your board or potentially debrick your hand.  The artifacts are runned to better contain the boards of the most aggro decks in the case of Artifact Scythe, and soften the match up against going first Orcusts in the case of Artifact Lancea.  Lastly Dinowrester Pankratops is a way to have more spam potential while going second and can pop 1 card to back up a loop.  The siding phase is quite flexible, all the main deck cards can be added cutting non-interractive Synchron cards that just helps to spam with Junk Speeder's effect, just be sure of what you do if replacing Quickdraw Synchron since it can be used as a starter due to it's discarding effect and consists on a free Crystron Needlefiber while discarding Crystron Rosenix."

With 3 Iblee and 3 Instant Fusions, your chances of locking down your opponent is far higher than with any other decks.

Where did that bring you?"" ""Right back to me.""","It is the summer of 2017. The sky is dark with pendulous rainclouds, small spits of water falling upon a graveyard. After the post-master rule 3 disaster, many burials were occurring. We come to a congregation of humanoid creatures, all gathered around many freshly filled graves.  The elderly insectoid priest raises his scripture to the podium. His mandibles open with a click, as he begins to speak.  “We gather here today over the graves of our flip archetype ancestors to pay our respects and allow their spirits to pass into the extra deck. Our dearest companions, who paved the way to our success, their bodies do lie still in their tombs, with their eternal rest but may they be in facedown defense position, to flip face up in the afterlife.  Blessed be, Konamus Moneus.”  A stranger, tall, dark, handsome. He steps in front of the congregates, a bouquet of deep red roses in his hand.  He speaks in a monotone drone: “Tragic. In their day, they may have even been tier one. May they rest in peace.” He lies the roses upon a headstone marked ‘ghostrick’ The stranger turns to leave, just as fast as he arrived. He is paused by a hand on his shoulder.  A woman. Frail and timid, and in the right light, slightly demonic. “Who are you? Did you share many memories with them as well?”  The man ponders solemnly.  “They were children to me, although naught but tools in their day. They gave me riches and fame. If given another chance, I would do it all over again, but right this time.”  A small tear rolls down his cheek, while the woman extends a kerchief towards him.  “Well, this little one here has no home.”  A small insectoid child peeks from behind the woman’s dress.  “Maybe you could take him in?” She suggests with a halfhearted smile.  The child, scared and young, timidly approaches the man and with a silent bow, he takes the child by the hand.  “What is your name, young one?” the man asks.  “umm… Krawler.” The boy squeaks out.  “I’m Konami” the man replies. “Let’s go home.”  Hey welcome to my Krawler guide.    Have you ever seen evidence of an angry god? Well Krawlers are here to bring forth the endophobic responses of your opponents in perhaps the most visceral flip deck known to man, while also lying just under the radar as to not provoke the wrath of komoney. As a personal note, I have no idea why these little dudes aren't seeing play. The absolute shenanigans this deck can pull off are somewhat vulgar and leave a bad taste in the mouths of opponents.  First up let's look at the ability that all krawlers have, their float effect. <blockquote><div>If this face-up card in its owner's control leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect: You can Special Summon 2 ""Krawler"" monsters with different names from your Deck in face-down Defense Position, except ""Krawler ----"".</div></blockquote> A few things to note here. Firstly, This effect specifies ""leaves the field"" so in that regard it is much like <a data-name=""Unification of The Cubic Lords"">Unification of The Cubic Lords</a>, So this will include - <ul>  	<li>Destruction</li>  	<li>Banishment (Face up)</li>  	<li>Bounce to hand</li> </ul> Return to deck effects do not apply to this rule, as a card in the maindeck cannot activate it's own effect unless otherwise specified <a>[source]</a>. Do remember this for mirror matches or even if you just get cheated by that one friend who plays the deck. I don't blame you if you came here looking for how to beat krawlers if you were having trouble. We'll get to that later though.  Now the strengths of this are tenfold. If a krawler's flip effect on your field is negated and the monster destroyed by your opponent, it's other effect triggers and allows you to not only have the chance to swarm, but in essence, for your opponent to out-resource your removal and completely brick your field, they will have to either allow you to have your way with their field, or use two negates per monster. The main perk of krawlers is that if an opponent attempts to stop the wrong effect, they may only be helping you, and the deck is full of inherent +1's and really easy to gain a card advantage with.  With that out of the way, let's have a change of pace and look at the spells first. The entire archetype plays really well with other flip archetypes, and most of that results from the field spell, <a data-name=""World Legacy in Shadow"">World Legacy in Shadow</a>. While not only being your additional summon engine, This card offers much in the way of protection and intimidation. While the 300 att/def buff may not seem to be much, Krawler Spine has an effective defense of 2400 with this card on the field, making for a pretty beefy level 2 that can soak an unexpected attack, as well as the effect of non-targeting send to graveyard removal on the battle destruction of a flip monster.  [Author's note: Please don't summon <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> against krawlers. No matter how hilarious it is to see it be thrown into the grave like trash. You're just embarrassing yourself.]  On the second effect, you get a free special summon from hand of a level 2 or lower insect monster in face up or <em>face down</em> defense position. Enough said. Run 3.  Next up is <a data-name=""World Legacy Survivor"">World Legacy Survivor</a>, a normal spell card that lets you fill up your grave by excavating the top five cards and adding a ""Krawler"" or ""World Legacy"" card to your hand from them, and pitching the rest. Be mindful that you will not be able to special summon monsters from the extra deck except for link monsters (if you are summoning other than links, bully for you.) A really good card for adding consistency, and giving your monsters graveyard targets along with being able to dig for answers or the cheeky graveyard trap. Mandatory 3 of unless you are running a mixed variant hybrid build, then try running 1 or 2.  Next up are the traps, and boy are these great.  <a data-name=""World Legacy Pawns"">World Legacy Pawns</a> is a continuous trap card that allows you to flip face down monsters face up, as well as letting you recycle krawlers from your graveyard back to your deck to flip them face down again. Sadly, a very hard once per turn and vulnerable to being targeted as it is a very easy destruction, and allows you to cheat out some flip effects. Personal choice is 3, but if you find yourself clogged, don't be afraid to drop it down to 2 or 1.  Now an odd mix, <a data-name=""Crusadia Krawler"">Crusadia Krawler</a> serves three purposes in descending order: <ul>  	<li>Summon to a zone a link monster points to search out a world legacy card</li>  	<li>Summon as emergency link material</li>  	<li>use during battle phase to block an attack</li> </ul> While the least expected 2'nd wave support for krawlers being a trap monster, it nestles it's way nicely into the deck at 3 or 2, being a good ""plan-b"" to whatever is going on at the time, or just to give our next card a target. Or even just to access <a data-name=""Crusadia Spatha"">Crusadia Spatha</a> for some quick link fixes.  Finally for our traps we have <a data-name=""World Legacy's Mind Meld"">World Legacy's Mind Meld</a> (say that 3 times fast). While many of the support cards released for Krawlers revolved around their flip effects, this takes a drastic turn and sucker-punches your opponent in the face, forcing them to play the game the way <em><strong>you</strong></em> want to play it. This card is also one of the very few cards that change an opponent's monster's effect to something else. Mainly, you will be using this card to interrupt your opponent's handtrap or monster effect that would negate one of the flip effects of your buggo boyes, and force them to dig the hole they will die in. The card also has a graveyard effect that you can use to summon a krawler from hand, deck, or grav- sorry, GY to a zone a link points to. Personal testing has led me to saving it for when I lose a krawler link just to summon it again with the 2+ posse of little shitlins. A useful chain-block if you need to just get out the kids as well.  Run at 3 and verbally assault people who aren't.  Now we get to the monsters (finally). Keep in mind the generic effects that they have, as mentioning it every time is just a headache that nobody needs to feel.  First up we have our sweet children. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Krawler Spine"">Krawler Spine</a> and <a data-name=""Krawler Axon"">Krawler Axon</a> are sisters, not twins. Spine destroys a monster on flip while Axon destroys a spell/trap. Simple and easy, 2 each will suffice unless you find yourself hurting for more bugs.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Krawler Glial"">Krawler Glial</a> is the recovery and main graveyard interaction of the deck. Mostly used to rush out the smaller friends from hand or recover a link back to the field. Run 3.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Krawler Receptor"">Krawler Receptor</a> (or receptionist if you have a sense of humor) Searches out your maindeck boys, and is great negate bait. almost always useful, it's good to run at 3 or 2.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Krawler Ranvier"">Krawler Ranvier</a> is not only hard to say, but is great for recurring your spent links and graveyard monsters. The +2 to hand comes in handy when you need to have a summon + field spell play for the next turn. Personal choice of 2.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Krawler Dendrite"">Krawler Dendrite</a> is a... unique monster. It allows you to send any monster from your deck to the grave. Normally just run it at 1, and if you need another, remember you don't have to summon <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>.</li> </ul> Oh, and our new baron of Up-Fuc*ery, <a data-name=""Deus X-Krawler"">Deus X-Krawler</a>. Let me explain why this is one of the best cards in the archetype.  Deus (<em>it's ok if i call you Deus, right?</em>) is one beast of a bug. The first of it's kind, an effect monster that activates while face down, If it is targeted by an opponent's card or effect while it is face down, you can flip it face up to negate and destroy that card.  Quoth the raven - <em>bitchin', man.</em>  But that's not all. Oh no, there is much more. After the card is turned face up, Monster effects that are activated on the field are negated for your opponent. They cannot interact with your deck with monsters. Essentially a searchable <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> without the banlist that doubles as a ""don't touch me"" <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> without a cost.  Finally it has a 3'rd effect that lets you search a level 9 when it is destroyed that isn't itself (different type and attribute). You won't be using that much, unless you're running that subterror or... <a data-name=""Amaterasu"">Amaterasu</a>? At that point, your actions are questionable, and you've made me <strong><em>very proud.</em></strong>  I normally run 2, just because he's summonable from deck and is inevitable if your opponent... you know... plays yugioh?  Finally for the in-archetype cards, we have the extra deck.  <a data-name=""X-Krawler Qualiark"">X-Krawler Qualiark</a>, along with having the <em>coolest</em> middle-school shaking name, is your main boss monster for the extra deck in terms of flavor. In reality, he is a good starter piece, but loses out on the utility front to some of the other choices for starters like <a data-name=""Subterror Behemoth Fiendess"">Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</a> and the newly announced <a data-name=""Seraphim Papillon"">Seraphim Papillon</a>. Great for if you are playing a pure deck though, as the more Krawler monsters you have on the board, the better they all are. This strategy is good only if your opponent can't shatter it like glass, otherwise, go hog wild kid. They're dead.  3 of just for the name, or 1 if you're not concerned.  Real talk though, two things of importance. <ul>  	<li>You face the <a data-name=""Crimson Nova Trinity the Dark Cubic Lord"">Crimson Nova Trinity the Dark Cubic Lord</a> problem that I mentioned in my <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/cubics-a-fundamental-guide/"">Fundamental Cubic Guide</a>.</li> </ul> <blockquote><div><em><strong>""At any point you could get him out, you should have won the game already. Let it be a sign that you are probably dragging things out beyond the capabilities of the Cubics themselves.""</strong> </em>Qualiark is a great choice for starting, and offers a way to get out of the link zone, but if at any point you are relying on him for your endgame, you won't be able to recover from any sort of interruption. Always try to expect it and not encounter it, and not vice-versa. Similar to Nova Trinity, you shouldn't be gunning for him to be your endgame, as the unexpected happens. A lot. Survivability wins more games than brute force.</div></blockquote> <ul>  	<li>The X-Krawler Extra deck monsters have a similar but wildly different effect than the kid Krawlers. This effect trades off the ""from deck"" in favor of ""from graveyard"" to summon, so make sure to not get shark'd because you get it mixed up. And in addition to the ""removed by opponent's card"" it also can trigger by being destroyed by battle. The summon from these cards also summon the monsters in face down, so you can't recur the links. All three of them have this, And mentioning every time will be tiresome, so keep that in mind.</li> </ul> Next is <a data-name=""Krawler Neurogos"">X-Krawler Neurogos</a>. Note, this link requires two <em>Insect</em> monsters as material, so make use of that spent <a data-name=""Man-Eater Bug"">Man-Eater Bug</a> or any other insect tech you throw in. In addition to being great protection as a pseudo <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, It boosts the attack and defense of whatever monster it points to by 300, and also doubles their battle damage. Two of these pointing at eachother like a spiderman meme make for a decent field if you are in a slow game where you need some time against a battle-phase deck. Easy 3 of.  For the same song but a different dance, <a data-name=""X-Krawler Synaphysis"">X-Krawler Synaphysis</a> also protects monsters from battle, and can be made with <em>Earth </em>monsters, so feel free to dump some subterror junk away if you need. The perk of this monster is that monsters it points to can make 2 attacks <strong>on monsters</strong> during the battle phase. Another 3 of.  Finally, we end on our tech cards.  Working our way down from the extra deck, we have <a data-name=""Seraphim Papillon"">Seraphim Papillon</a><a data-name=""Seraphim Papillon"">. This little butterfly is a new addition to the insect family, and requires 2+ monsters with different names. With three different krawlers, you have yourself a 2700 attack link 3 bug to start. By removing the counters it received as a quick effect, you can summon one of your sweet beans from the grave for additional link summons or to flip back face down with </a><a data-name=""World Legacy Pawns"">World Legacy Pawns</a><a data-name=""Seraphim Papillon"">. A great 2 of in the extra deck, just so if one gets dumpster'd by a solemn, the swarm will return and oH G<strong>OD IT HA<em>S WINGS!!!</em></strong></a>  <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>. What, you wanted an explanation? Shut up and draw cards, scrub. All the good decks have a dragon in the extra deck. Run just 1.  <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> is a tricky lil bitch. buy's you some time if you have some bricked link 2s on the field, as well as offering the slightest bit of removal once someone actually does something about it. A good gut check for stun and removal decks. I like it at 1.  <a data-name=""Subterror Behemoth Fiendess"">Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</a>. Pretty much a staple for any flip deck that is running on that whack earlygame stall. Great for if you just <strong><em>CAN'T </em></strong>get that field spell, assuming you survived turn 2. I like her at 1, since she's a tough bitch and isn't afraid to hide behind the Krawler's own problematic microaggressions.  Now for the controversial pick. <a data-name=""Inzektor Picofalena"">Inzektor Picofalena</a> (what is up with these bug names by the way?) is a good one of in this deck for the reason that krawler monsters don't specify that they have to be in the monster zones when they are removed by card effect to get their trigger to summon. Against decks with a good amount of mass S/T destruction, equipping one of your smaller boys from the deck may end up saving you the game if they just try to wipe the S/T zone. She also recycles 3 for a draw, so a good mid to lategame card to pull some of your insect links back into extra or bug babies into the deck for some added length to your combos.  Now my favorite part, the main deck tech.  As an absolute madman for actual trash nobody has touched in years, my loins quake for <a data-name=""Ghost of a Grudge"">Ghost of a Grudge</a>. This card is wild. Combined with <a data-name=""Deus X-Krawler"">Deus X-Krawler</a>, you can brick your opponent's entire field warranting them to entirely set up again (without monster effects) while you swing in for pure level 2 insect attack damage. I run 2 just for the cheese, but if you can make 3 work, <em><strong>please call me.</strong></em>  <a data-name=""Traptrick"">Traptrick</a> is just mean. Drop any of your traps minus Pawns from your deck and activate it. Then beat your opponent about the head and neck with some insect babies. 2 or 3 is great depending on the amount of asshole-ery you are feeling that day.  <a data-name=""Chain Hole"">Chain Hole</a> is the perfect amount of ""no u"" for that ash or whatever is on the field. If it's an extra deck monster, feel free to tell them Skarot sent you. Get some of this networking done for me. Run at 2 if you are seeing too many handtraps.  <a data-name=""Ghostrick Scare"">Ghostrick Scare</a>. Perfect for the explosive play your heart desires in a flip deck. Run at two or three because I bought an Alucard themed mat 2 days before MR4 was announced. Don't my legacy die.  <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> (duh, 2)  For probably the only tech monster you will run in pure, <a data-name=""Tindangle Angel"">Tindangle Angel</a> holds a dear place in my flip decks just because ""end the battle phase"" is a real tilter for the enemy, and nothing pleases me more than watching my opponent's life drain from their eyes because of some 2 cent card I found in a bulk bin. run at 2 - 3 if you find yourself needing more face down summon cheese during the battle pha- oh wait its already main phase 2.  For those of you wondering, You can play a bunch of different things with krawlers as well, since they are just happy to be here honestly. <ul>  	<li>Subterror Krawler Shaddoll is an odd 60 card variant I devised in a flip deck fever-dream. Consistency is surprisingly high, and for 3 options of endgame, you can't beat these prices.</li>  	<li>Prediction princess Krawlers is a fun deck if you like having rituals do all the work for you. 40 card normally, but everything is searchable, so don't be afraid to spit in the eye of pro-set deck standards.</li>  	<li>Krawler Cubics don't work. I tried. Laugh at my folly.</li>  	<li>Krawler Subterror stall is pretty fun as well, with the guru being out and all.</li> </ul> Anyways, thanks for coming to my ted-talk Skarot out."

It actually ended up working really well and this deck is insane against most decks. The goal is to go second and bait out your opponent's negates (breaking their board) and then use <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> to stun them and cause them to either deck out, or you can OTK them when you get the resources since they will just keep passing their turn. The hiita combo where you link summon into hiita and special summon a monster from your opponent's graveyard is busted because then you can go into <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> and kill them that turn. Surprisingly from my experience at least, this deck really doesn't brick. It can but it has only bricked very rarely for me and the only way you can really brick is by your entire hand being just Infernoid monsters. This deck is fun to play and it's competitive. Most of the side deck I have composed is for going first because if you choose to go second game won because you win the die roll/rps they will force you to go first game 2. Also I know a lot of you probably don't like Pot of Desires, but trust me in this deck it's busted. Just try it and you'll see! Hope you guys enjoy."

This deck can special summon a lot of level 1 monsters and that can allow you to activate Hidden Armory and search an equip spell card (Psychic Blade most of the time) and inflict a lot of damage. You can use Kaijus to get rid off negations and Red Reboot againts traps, the deck it's simple and can defeats a lot of unprepared players and Assembled Nightingale can protect itself if you can't in that turn.  &nbsp;  Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oTyUu-2Ljs"

Then Synchro into Superheavy Samurai Stealth Ninja, attack directly, 1400 damage, just enough for the requirements for Berserker Soul. Actviate it, if not negated, and it's effect damage isn't negated, you win. Since you have no other Spell/Trap cards in your deck. If that fails, I would wait till you get Metaltron XII, then Tribute 3 to Summon it (IK it's steep, but just pendulum summon 3 monsters or whatever). When it gets destroyed, Special Summon Steam Train King from your extra deck. Banish your Berserker Soul along with other Spell/Traps in the Graveyards, to deal damage. Also now the deck should run as well as it did before and now you have a 4800 defence beatstick.  NOTE: You could add ""Called By the Grave"" to stop any ash or ghost ogre or whatever, but i wouldn't, I know it's a huge risk, but if you draw into Called By the Grave when activating Berserker Soul, you might lose. The only reason I added Continuous Traps in my side deck, is just incase. But I wouldn't activate them both at the same time lol. And always add in at least 1 Cosmic Cyclone to your deck if you decide to add Royal Decree or Imperial Order.  **And I am pretty sure there is a card that banishes all SPELL/TRAPS that is sent to the GY, but I forgot it.** (I have a bad memory)."

Here we have some littles updates like  the deban of Super Polymerization and the brand new Salamangreat Almiraj (TCG since yesterday) that considerably upgrade the consistancy of the deck and can protect Invoked Mechaba while playing first. Spells like Instant Fusion and Mind Control are usefull to suppress opponent's ressources and facilitate OTKs, and hand traps and backrow removers/super polymerization can contain opponent's plays in conjunction of Mechaba.  Almiraj is great in this deck particularly, because while starting first you can solidify your board and protect your Mechaba from destruction more easily and in more starting hands. Plus if you face Cyber Dragon your Mechabe won't be eaten by Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon. But the most notable boost is the consistancy, if you normal summon Aleister The Invoker and tuto Invocation, you can just use it to special summon Salamangreat Almiraj, set the Invocation in the same column and start to summon youtr Mekk-Knights, just starting by 1 card. Now you can easily summon mechaba without using your light hand traps if playing first and just have Terraforming/Magical Meltdown/Aleister The Invoker + Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall.  The rest of the main deck and extra deck use pretty classic engines, excepted the Lair Of Darkness backed up by 2 Super Polymerization and so the addition of Starving Venom and Violet Chimera directly main deck, and the 2 Cosmic Cyclones that are used over Twin Twisters to keep some materials to discard with the Super Polymerizations, Mechaba's effect and Aleister The Invoker Of Madness's effect. World Legacy's Secret is played at 1 to negate key monster's effects at crucial moments and have potentially more board for a future OTK, plus it's searchable by Mekk-Knight Of The Morning Star's effect and will beneficiate of a good protection effect against direct battles.  The good capacity of the deck to negate cards with the high ratio of hand traps and the great disruption effects of Invoked Mechaba and the likes of World Legacy's Secret and Super Polymerization give you a good match up against most of decks that don't excessively spam the board while playing first. Great ways to handle a lot of monsters increasing your ressources like Instant Fusion and Mind Control + the Mekk-Knight engine give youthis time a good match up against most of decks that don't set too much disruption depending the spam potential of your hand while playing second. To help against boards capitalizing on monster's effects, Millenium-Eyes Restrict and Thousand-eyes restrict can block some boards during the time you construct a solid OTK board or just force the use of an anti spell effect to break through opponent's board with the rest of your hand.  &nbsp;  The side deck  The deck don't like facing too much backrow, often being dependent on Magical Meltdown/Aleister The Invoker effects to make the most efficient boards, so the addition of Twin Twister is greater against decks like Sky Striker and Altergeist at the cost of Cosmic Cyclone banishment side effect and Red Reboot may be a deadly weapon against Trap focused control decks.  The artifact package helps against Orcusts and decks hardly depending on the extra deck like Salamangreat, plus artifact monsters are good targets of Invocation after being used as link materials.  The winged Dragon Of Ra - Sphere Mode is an insane way to handle going first decks that sets negation boards like Guardragons builds. Here we have 1 classical Winged Dragon Of Ra that can be used as link material during your next turn being a reliable way to gain 1 monster in a deck that don't run many of them without counting the hand traps, besides it's still a huge beatstick that will have a 4000/4000 body due to the Sphere Mode effect and can clean some monsters of your opponent's board with it's effect."
