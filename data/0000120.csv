I haven't tested the deck yet but I can give a few tips. </em>  <em><strong>XYZ Summoning Tips-</strong> XYZ summoning Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon isn't that hard and you only need Two Level Four Monsters the only tip I can really give you is to only summon Dark Rebellion when it is necessary for example if your opponents monster has like Four Thousand Attack Points then you definitely want to get   out Dark Rebellion and activate its effect.  </em>  <em><strong>Synchro Summoning Tip- </strong>If you want to get Clear Wing Synchro Dragon or Clear Wing Fast Dragon out I'd recommend to first summon Performapal Parrotrio,<strong> </strong>Performapal Spike Eagle and Performapal Stamp Turtle then once you have all the three monsters on the field use Stamp Turtle's Effect to increase Parrotrio's and Spike Eagle's by one. After that you have the required levels to Synchro Summon! Do not summon Clear Wing Synchro Dragon summon Clear Wing Fast Dragon instead since it is more useful. </em>  <em><strong>Fusion Summoning Tips- </strong>Fusion Summoning with a Performapal Deck can pose a problem </em><i>depending on what you draw and what's your starting hand. If you want to get out Starving Venom Fusion Dragon to try and destroy most of your opponents monsters the best way to summon Starving Venom is to Pendulum Summon Two Dark Monsters then summon Performapal Trump Witch and tribute her to add Polymerzation to your hand. For Ru</i><i>ne-Eyes Pendulum Dragon and Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon I can't give any tips with them but if you want to Fusion Summon even more I'd recommend to add Two more Polymerzation's to your deck.</i>  <em>This Deck isn't exactly meant for competitive play but you can still use it!</em>"

Powerful Cards Like <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> only can use their on board effects on an opponent’s already established board. This build takes advantage of two main cards <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a>.  <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> lets you discard it and a Nekroz ritual spell to stop your opponent from special summoning from the extra deck during Main Phase 1. Since a player can’t enter battle phase and therefore main phase 2 turn 1, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> is electively a hand trap version of <a data-name=""Domain of the True Monarchs"">Domain of the True Monarchs</a> on turn 1. Also every Nekroz ritual spell lets you banish itself and one Nekroz monster to search another ritual spell, giving you back much needed value when discarded with <a data-name=""Nekroz of  Sophia"">Nekroz of  Sophia</a>.  <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> is an often underutilized tool that has the following effect on field: “Your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of a ""Nekroz"" Ritual Spell Card“ And “""Nekroz"" Ritual Monsters you control cannot be targeted by an opponent's card effects“. This card lets you play around negates that would stop your ritual summons. <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> combined with a ritual summon of <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> can easily disarm your opponent’s monster negates. Its effect when tributed, while not the main reason for its usage in the deck is also relevant allowing for recycling of resources in longer games. It also should be noted that as this card is a level 4 water monster it aids in making <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and then <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>.  The Deck also utilizes the cards <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>,<a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode""> The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, and <a data-name=""Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity"">Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity</a> to help go second. Gizmek Uka is fantastic in this deck as it can punish the usage of the ever popular <a data-name=""Cryston Halqifbrax"">Cryston Halqifbrax</a> with a summon of both itself and <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a> from deck. Gizmek Uka can also fetch both itself and the two non-ritual Impcantation Monsters if the opponent doesn’t play <a data-name=""Cryston Halqifbrax"">Cryston Halqifbrax</a>.  <strong>The Math and Consistency</strong>  While its not perfect odds, this deck is optimized to have some form of blowout over about 85% of the time. The Deck will simply draw one of <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, or <a data-name=""Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity"">Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity</a> around 78.89% of the time. That’s a healthy base for going second but what else does it have? The deck opens <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and a ritual spell in 17.83% of games, that’s about 1 out of every 5 where your opponent cant use their extra deck to set up negates to stop your ritual summons.  Outside of these blowouts let’s look at Nekroz’s inherent searchability. 10/42 cards in the deck search another nekroz card with no questions asked. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> gets you any Nekroz Monster which gets you <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a> who in turn gets you any Nekroz Ritual spell. Another 13/42 cards search Nekroz cards with a bit of setup. Due to Nekroz’s heavily search reliant playstyle its very hard to calculate exactly how many negates on average this deck can play through. From personal experience being able to play through 1 negate is almost guaranteed, 2 negates is common enough, and 3 negates can be done with a lucky enough hand.  <strong>Side Deck and Extra Deck.</strong>  This deck struggles quite a lot against non-extra deck focused decks. That's not to say its unwinnable but that’s what the side deck is for. We run a backrow destruction package in the form of <a data-name=""Harpie’s feather Duster"">Harpie’s feather Duster</a> and Three copies of <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>. <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> also helps deal with backrow decks. The rest of the cards enable the deck to be played going first. The additional copies <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus </a>are there for the classic nekroz play of setting up a floodgate with <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> style battle protection. <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> combine with any spellcaster Nekroz monster just shuts down any spell-based deck. Last but not least <a data-name=""There can be Only One"">There can be Only One</a> is an easy disruption card for Nekroz to play with as more often than not only one of each type of monsters will be on the field at once.  Most of the Extra deck is focused around enabling <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>. <a data-name=""Herald of the Ark Light"">Herald of the Ark Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> are commonly used for effects when ritual summoning. Everything else was chosen because they either recycle themselves or can be special summoned off of an opponent’s <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> type effects. I also tried to set these up to play around giving Lights and Fire attributes to <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, but several levels didn’t feature enough monsters to do this Perfectly. <a data-name=""Nepthys, The Sacred Flame"">Nepthys, The Sacred Flame</a>, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>, and <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> are al situation tools the deck can use."

Using Air Raider and Irradiator to special summon them to the field to make a strong rank 8 xyz monster is easy if there are not a lot of resources in the hand. A lot of main deck monsters destroy other monster by effects, this can help bring out Citadel easily through his effect. Machina Possesstorage is a great way to bring out extra deck monsters due to its effect on summon which brings back one machina monster in the graveyard. Possesstorage can also get rid of Spells or traps easily by sending targeting one machina monster you control and one spell or trap card on your opponents field and send them to the hand. This deck can also bring out synchro monsters through Torque Tune Gear. Either use Fortress and Tune Gear to bring out a level 8 synchro or use his effect to equip to a level 4 and synchro summon through that way. The level 8 synchro monster depends on a persons budget."

Fun fact: Kaijus are one of my favorite archetypes. I adore the entire Kaiju genre so, the archetype itself is something I love. Deck guide? Deck guide. 3x Bigfoot- 3k beater if you get it out, easy card removal if it's discarded. Underappreciated Danger! imo 3x Chupacabra- draw/tribute fodder, and can special summon a discarded Danger! if itself is discarded. 1x Nessie- Would run at more if I could, but it's limited. 28k wall if you get out that's also just draw/tribute fodder, but if discarded, it gives you another Danger! to replace the lost Nessie, which is amazing. 2x Thunderbird- 28k beater if it special summons itself, can remove possible problem cards like Imperm and Fog Blade that your opponent has set otherwise. 1x Jackalope- Yet again, draw/tribute fodder. But if discarded, gives you another Danger! to act as tribute fodder. Fantastic Danger!, it's limited for a reason. 1x Snek Boy- can't spell his name and i'm not gonna try. Adorable card, and it gives you tribute/draw fodder and it's always tribute fodder no matter what, as it special summons itself when discarded. I'm tempted to get one just to frame it because I love this card 1x Pankratops- Easy special summon and monster removal, but can also serve as tribute fodder. 2x Dogoran- tribute monster, 3k beater 3k Gamaciel- Easy monster removal 2x Jizikuru- Fantastic 33k beater with a built in negate 2x Majesty's Fiend- stop playing lol 1x Radian- literally just tribute a monster, either an opponent's or your's, OTK lol 1x Jupiter- Requires two tributes but that's not very hard for this deck, discards two cards which can be Dangers! for their effects, and steals an opponent's monster to become a big beater 1x Pluto- Also two tributes but, hand info and if you somehow guess write ya get a free monster 3x Thunder King- The boss monster. 33k beater, attacks three times on occasion, can OTK with ease 2x Vanity's Fiend- stop playing the game lol 3x Interrupted Kaiju Slumber- Dark Hole combined with a free monster, just give your opponent a Gamaciel and it's free damage and you can go in for an OTK with ease 3x Kyouto Waterfront- Great field spell, racks up counters fast as fuck as you tear through the opponent and get rid of your own cards, can search a Kaiju when neccesary or provide counters for the Kaiju's own effects 3x Pot of Extravagance- fantastic draw power, what else do u want me to say 2x World Legacy Monstrosity- Leads into the occasional Eternity, and thins out your deck. 3x There Can Only Be One- Locks down nearly any deck and stops them from playinh, making them an easy target to OTK The extra deck is just banish fodder, you might wanna link into Linkuribo then Gardna on occasion though, or maybe make an Eternity, but banish the rest Playing guide Deck is a pretty simple OTK based going second deck. You spam out Dangers! and draw if you didn't open with an Interrupted; if you did open an Interrupted, play it and destroy the board, then special summon your Thunder King and a Gamaciel for the opponent. Afterwards, spam Dangers! for tribute fodder, and tribute into either a Kaiju if you didn't use the Interrupted method, or go into a Fiend or beater with tributes. Rack up counters for Thunder King. Afterwards, set There Can Only Be if you opened with it. Attack the opponent, although you probably won't kill them in the first turn. Use the effects of the Fiends and such to make sure they just can't play, then OTK them entirely. Note: Yes, you'll want to go second. If going first, just set up your floodgates and hope. Maybe make an Eternity as well, or a Pluto for hand info before they even start their plays. Fun fact: I'm mostly blind"

Cons</strong>  <em>Pros of playing the deck:</em> <ul>  	<li>The gameplan is really simplistic, which helps avoiding any mistakes in gameplay</li>  	<li>The Floodgate effect of Evilswarm Ophion is still very strong (but very meta dependent though)</li>  	<li>Evilswarm has an inbuilt protection against easy main deck Outs, as it can search its own Spell/Trap protection while also making your opponent unable to summon Kaijus/Pankratops/etc</li>  	<li>'There can only be one' and 'Dimension Shifter' nearly hit every deck, so being able o play them without any downside speaks for this deck</li>  	<li>The deck is not reliant on the graveyard and doesn't search often ( usually 1 time for Infection Pandemic and that's it)</li>  	<li>The deck also isn't really reliant for on field monster effects to go through (Evilswarm Castor's additional summon effect can't be negated with effect Veiler /etc and Rescue rabbit banishes for cost)</li>  	<li>The deck can easily be sided for a match up, as the spots for backrow-cards are not fixed</li>  	<li>in a meta, that isnt dominated by combo decks , your gameplan can catch many people off guard</li>  	<li>The deck leaves a lot of free extra deck space that can be filled with any targets you find helpful</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <em>Cons of playing the deck:</em> <ul>  	<li>'Ash Blossom &amp; Jouyous Spring' or 'PSY-Framegear Gamma' can hit hard against Rescue Rabbit / Ghost Ogre on ophion's search effect also is hard to play against ( notice that if you activated Dimension Shifter, Ghost Ogre can't be activated as it has to be send to the Graveyard; also when Ophion hits the field, PSY-Framegear Gama is turned off)</li>  	<li> If you are playing against Link based decks, your backrow mostly is your only hope</li>  	<li>while Going second, your tools for winning are very limited</li>  	<li>As this deck only plays a few monster negates ( 3 Solemn Strike/ 3 Forbidden Chalice gives a 57% chane to draw at least 1, not counting the potential of Allure of Darkness to draw further through your deck), match-ups against decks with inbuilt backrow removal are very draw dependent.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Card Ratios &amp; Explaination</strong>  <em>Main Deck</em> <ul>  	<li>3 Evilswarm Heliotrope: We have to play 3 in order to maximize the chance that Rescue Rabbit is live (the chance to draw 2 or more copies of Heliotrope is 3,6%), also It's not as bricky as someone might think, as we can summon it with Evilswarm Castor's effect, use it for Allure of Darkness or just reshuffle it into the deck with Infestation Infection ( besides using it for Rescue Rabbit and Unexpected Dai)</li>  	<li>3 Evilswarm Castor: It's additional summon effect lets you play around every Hand Trap as it can't be negated</li>  	<li>3 Rescue Rabbit: The perfect enabler for the deck, even if its weak against Ash and Gamma</li>  	<li>3 Evilswarm Mandragora: We need targets for Evilswarm Kerykeion/ Castor/ Infestation Infection, also it can be helful going 2nd ( special summoning this plus normal summoning any lvl 4 monster is already a Rank 4 Xyz)</li>  	<li>3 Dimension Shifter: Insanely strong Hand Trap, that can be good going first and 2nd (you literally always use it, exeptyou draw it as your 6t card and need fodder for Allure of Darkness)</li>  	<li>2 Evilswarm Kerykeion: Its a good Mid-Game centered card, but you really want to see other cards in your opening hand ( 2 copies might come up in he long run, also it's a target for Castor)</li>  	<li>1 Evilswarm Castor: Spell/Trap removal that tributes for cost can be useful in niche scenarios, if not, it's at least another Evilswarm Target</li>  	<li>3 Unexpected Dai: Works as a good starter/ bait for Ash; if you draw more that 1 copy you could set it as a bait for upcoming backrow removal</li>  	<li>3 Allure of Darkness: The deck plays 15 dark monsters and desperately needs a way to unbrick some hands/ swich unused monsters to potential backrow (an extra copy of Dimension Shifter is a good example)</li>  	<li>3 Forbidden Chalice: Good going 1st and second; can be activated in the Damage Step</li>  	<li>1 Reinforcement of the Army: Searches Evilswarm Castor</li>  	<li>1 Infestation Pandemic: Helps keeping your Ophion (a)live, you usually search this with Ophion ( some people play more than 1, I tend to keep an extra copy in the side deck for consistency reasons)</li>  	<li>1 Double or Nothing: We have to play this Brick in order to quickly close out games with the Utopia Double package</li>  	<li>3 Solemn Strike: Good ging 1st and still useful going 2nd, as you can't chain on it with spell speed 2 (one might swap it for Solemn Judgement for backrow protection, but I'd rather keep that in the side deck)</li>  	<li>3 There can only be One: This floodgate + Ophion forms a lock that is kind of hard to break for a lot of decks, the only downside is that you can't follow up with utopia double/ Rescue Rabbit ( it only summons 1 Heliotrope from the deck instead of 2)</li>  	<li>3 Crackdown: An insanely good card for simplyfied gamestates, while our goal is to achive exactly that</li>  	<li>1 Infestation Infection: Works as another target for Ophion's search effect, switches unwanted Evilswarm Monsters to useful ones, if Ophion is about to leave the filed you can at least shuffle him back to the Extra Deck in order to not lose card advantage</li> </ul> <em>Extra Deck</em> <ul>  	<li>2 Evilswarm Ophion: Boss monster of the deck ( you might bump it up to 3, but  in scenarios where that 3rd copy would be useful, you usually lose anyways)</li>  	<li>1 Evilswarm Bahamut: as a great effect, but is quite conditional though</li>  	<li>1 Utopia Double: For OTKs</li>  	<li>1 Utopia the Lightning: For overrunning monsters that can only be killed by battle</li>  	<li>1 Utopia: In order to use Utopia Double/the Lightning</li>  	<li>1 Tornado Dragon: For Spell/Trap removal</li>  	<li>1 Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer: For Monster removal/ swiching monsters to defense position to overrrun them/ turn off their effects</li>  	<li>1 Evilswarm Exciton Knight: Works good going 2nd for board wiping/ even better if you sided in Dark Ruler no more</li>  	<li>1 Bagooska the terribly tired Tapir: if you can't OTK in your 3rd turn you usually stall with this + Ophion; this card might be better going 1st in some match ups</li>  	<li>1 Abyss Dweller: Good going 1st in some match ups, or for further stalling if you couldn't OTK</li>  	<li>1 Underclock Taker: good for linking off stolen monsters/ overruning your enemy</li>  	<li>1 Knightmare Phoenix: can link off unused Monsters/ as a back up plan if you already used Tornado Dragon</li>  	<li>1 Knightmare Cerberus: can link off unused Monsters/ as a back up plan for Castel</li>  	<li>1 Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: I play Super Polymerization in the side deck ( if you don't, play what is suitable for you)</li> </ul> <strong>Side Deck</strong> <ul>  	<li>3 Dark Ruler no more: very strong card going 2nd, especially with Excition Knight</li>  	<li>3 Super Polymerization: extremely good going 2nd against certain match ups</li>  	<li>3 Twin Twister: against Backrow decks/ decks that rely on certain Spell/Trap cards</li>  	<li>3 Solemn Judgement: to prepare for upcoming backrow removal of your enemy if going 1st/ to negate  Spell/Traps  that are the core of your enemy's strategy</li>  	<li>1 Infestation Pandemic: If you are facing more Spell/Trap hate against your Ophion</li>  	<li>1 Imperial Order: against Spell oriented decks</li>  	<li>1 Anti-Spell Fragrance:  against Spell oriented decks ( doesn't hurt yourself as much as Imperial Order, in that sense you might switch to 2 Anti-Spell Fragrance and cut Imperial Order)</li> </ul> <strong>Non Budget Variants</strong>  If you aren't playing on a budget( you might also change to a meta deck if that is the case) you probably should swap Allure of Darkness for Pot of Extravagance and rearrange your Extra deck; you should also swap  Forbidden Chalice for Infinite Impermanence; Nibiru/ Forbidden Droplet/Lightning Storm are probably stronger  side Deck options than the cheaper ones I mentioned  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

It's taken a minute but I believe I've finally built a formidable magnet warrior deck.  &nbsp;  First of Adamancipators are still great, by removing block dragon I couldn't put one of the best rock searches in here. But adamancipators and magnet warriors go hand in hand when it comes to searching for the monsters that you need to win the game. It only takes a matter of timewhich isnt something we always have today in the Yu-Gi-Oh world, but oh well right? I recently seen on someone else's decklist that Fossil's and Magnet Warriors work well together. The Adamancipators take care of filling up the field and Fossils use the discarded rock monsters as fusion materials to create a quick gate way to a great rock monster. Depending on which monster you'll be able to summon, you can gain some effects that'll give you the upper hand.  &nbsp;  Starting of with all four magnet warriors in your hand isn't an issue, Its actually right where I would wanna be. Magnet tip: Do not summon berserkion right away. Take your time. Use Gamma to summon Delta and send the other beta to the grave. Beta is an amazing card but its very easy to search your warriors in this deck so he's as much needed as usual. Now during your opponents turn you want to use Gamma's effect to summon another Delta from the deck in defensive position, hint hint, most of the rock monsters you summon will be in defense. Then use that Delta to send the other Gamma. Now if your opponent destroys one of your Deltas. You can use his effect to summon Valkyrion from the deck and boom easy hit stick to have on the field for protection. Next turn summon Berserkion now you have them both until either you get poly or find a way to get yourself out of trouble (if you're in any.)  &nbsp;  Now if you start off with Admancipators and a Weathering Soldier. Do your best not to use the weathering solider unless you already have Fossil Fusion. The Adama's mill effect will more than likely find another weathering solider. It's better to start of with a level 2 tuner so that you can have the opportunity to go into crystal wing. Synchro summon Raptite to searching ANY rock monsters instead of Leonite's Adama card effect.  &nbsp;  My current best combo is CrystalWing and Imperion's effects. Just those two alone stop my opponents whole push. Two gameciels so that you can have extra options for WATER monsters in the grave for Dragite effect. Naturia Beast mills everytime to stop spell cards, Gorgonic Guardian negates monster effects, Stardust Dragon negates destruction effects.  &nbsp;  Left A Very Detailed Explanation for the beginners, Vets will understand this combo easy. Please let me know how you feel about the deck in the comments! Let me know what other things you try!"

I use a lot of tech support cards for negation and the ability to counter. I get a lot of compliments on my Red Dragon Archfiend build.  I use two each of <b>Twin Twister</b> to get rid of field cards, counter traps, normal traps, and annoying continuous cards.  <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> stops opponents nuisance negation/problematic monsters so I can quickly get out Supernova Dragon and Abyss in my first turn.  <strong>Resurrection cards</strong> for bringing back my monsters that the opponent sent to the graveyard.  <strong>The only high level in my main deck:</strong>  <strong>Chaos Hunter</strong> is the best counter for stopping opponent from banishing cards. Enough said. It's hilarious against Dark Magician decks and zombies, or any build that is built around banishing or has banishing support cards.  <strong>Synchro Call</strong> helps me quickly get out Abyss or Void Ogre, or save a monster from any problematic situation.  <strong>Red Screen</strong> is just a far better version of Swords Of Revealing Light. It also helps me get out Abyss, Bane, Calamity, Nova, or Supernova.  The level four monsters:  <strong>Stygian</strong> solves an issue with being disrupted in a match where I get negated but can solve it by special summoning a monster from my hand. Another thing is that it allows me to get a second level four on the field after I have one Rising Dragon to special summon a second Rising Dragon.  <strong>Valkyria</strong> helps me special summon it while I have a <strong>Rising Dragon</strong> on the field to bring out a second Rising Dragon. Another thing, it helps me send certain monsters to the graveyard that will benefit me later on.  <strong>Wildwind</strong> helps me special summon it and allow me to get out two Rising Dragons.  &nbsp;  The strategy is to bring out <strong>Supernova Dragon</strong> and <strong>Abyss</strong>...  With, on a great hand, sometimes I am able to get out Abyss, Supernova, Void Ogre, and Bane,  or on rarer occasions, with Calamity amongst them in one turn.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><strong>Be prepared for constant rage quitters, whiners, accussers, etc!!

","Like normal, i'm trying to mash Invokeds into something because I love Invokeds. Myutants don't work as well with Invokeds as Dragonmaids did, but they still do work fairly well. They have a few ranging attributes to use, and Invocation banishes cards, providing more banish fodder. Deck list time. 2x Arsenal- too bricky at 3. Another one of the, like, weird evolved forms that I run at 2. Pretty good in the current meta, considering how it can dodge fog blade and imperm. 2x Mist- i'm seeing a patttern here. I run all the weird evolved forms at 2. Mist gives instant advantage by banishing a card, which can easily turn into a plus 3 in the right situation. 2x Beast- Beast is solid. Can't be targeted by monster effects, which dodges Dragoon, Borreload, etc. Also negates spell cards by banishing cards, so it gathers advantage. 3x Aleister- Mandatory for the Invoked engine. Great searcher as well. 1x GB-88- Running at 1, since it's effect is awkward to special summon it. Works well with Cry though. It's also fairly good late game recovery. 3x ST-46- Reliable searcher for the Myutants, as it searches a spell/trap. If you need fusion, you can get a fusion, you can get a cry, etc. Great searcher, staple 3 of. M 3x M-05- adds a monster, which is also fairly nice, although not as great as searching a spell/trap. Reliable card tho. 3x Ash Blossom- ez negate 2x Ghost Ogre- ez destruction 1x Cyberstien- This deck doesn;t use it's normal summon a ton, so if you don't need to normal summon an Aleister at the moment, you can normal summon a Cyberstein to cheat out Ultimus. Banish/fusion fodder otherwise 3x Magical Meltdown- Easily snags you an Aleister if you don't already have one, and gives good protection. Replace it after you're done with it with Lab 3x Myutant Evolution Lab- Da archtypel field spell. Easy special summon that can free up your normal summon for Aleister or Cyber-Stein, and a small attack boost. Replace Meltdown with this after you search 3x Invocation- Da invoked fusion spell. Provides extra banish fodder as well, which is nice. 3x Myutant Fusion- Da Myutant fusion spell. Also provides banish fodder while getting out fusions. 1x Terraforming- Searches out whichever field spell you need. Nice searcher 1x Set Rotation- Can be used to make use of your Magical Meltdowns and such in the deck after you've searched, in order to stop the opponent. 3x Myutant Cry- Great for getting out Ultimus easier during the opponent's turn, also searchable by Trap Trick 3x Trap Trick- Searhces Cry to fuse Ultimus easier, and provides more banish fodder Extra deck 3x Ultimus- Strong beater and boss monster 2x Mechaba- Easy negates 3x Synthethis- Nice negate built in, generally a solid monster to ""rank up"" into Ultimus by fusing it 1x Magellanica- 3k beater for an OTK finish 2x Purgatrio- Another solid beater 2x Cocytus- Stalls for time like an asshole by summoning a wall 1x Raijin- Built in book of moon, helps to beat over problem monsters 1x Caliga- god i love floodgates Playing guide This won't be super in depth or anything. I've done a bit of play testing, and my main strategy is fairly simple.  If you don't have an Aleitser, activate Meltdown to search one. If you already have one, Meltdown is just usable for Set Rotation. If you didn't activate Meltdown, or after activating Meltdown, activate Evo lab to special summon a monster. Search Evo with terraforming if you don't already have it.  Tribute the small special summoned Myutant (the one that's in the cage) to search either a monster or a spell, while also providing more banish fodder. Afterwards, fusion summon Synthethis using Myutant Fusion, or search a Fusion using 46 if you don't already have one. After fusion summoning Synthethis, use Invocation to get out whatever Invoked fits the current moment attribute wise. Pass turn. During your opponent's turn, activate Cry and use Synthethis to get out Ultimus much easier. Note: I didn't mention it, but throughout this, you can normal summon Cyber Stein or Aleister if neccesary. Cyber Stein is fantastic for cheating out Ultimus, or if you already have Ultimus, you can use it to get out an extra Ultimus or a Synthethis. also note you'll want to go first so you can set up Cry with Trap Trick to get into Ultimus easier. Any feedback or thoughts is appreciated in the comments. Thanks for reading this, have a good day."

I don't collect card anymore but i still play on my switch when I have free time. I mostly play a Blue eyes deck( I know, but i like it). this is a concept deck ive hand floating in my head for a few days, combining some elements of of Seto's dragons into some that that might not fully work yet. as of writing i have not fully play tested this deck and i havent fully had time to work all the bugs out but here is the main way to play  &nbsp;  plan A is Ritual Summon with advance ritual,  either Chaos max of Chaos regular is fine but its a 3000+ on turn one. proceed to demolish what's in front. for added power and more attacks silvers cry will res the Blue eyes you sent to the grave. this will net you about 6000 + damage, downside is no real way to save your monsters is a trap or magic or effect takes them out.  &nbsp;  plan B, if all your monsters are destroyed, no worries, you still have a few options left but you will need the right cards. Maiden of blue will resummon with a good shield or chaos Emp will banish above monsters to then reclaim the duel.  &nbsp;  Plan C if you made it to this plan you are all kinds of done, but in the event you need it. i added some Fang cards to add a few back up plans.  &nbsp;  you can play any plan in any order but i highly recommend using the Ritual monsters first.  &nbsp;  that's all for now.  &nbsp;  thank you and enjoy."

Quick disclaimer: This is a combo deck, not a control variant like the one that topped  Here's a video detailing the deck if you are interested: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBofBlPBthQ</a>  STRATEGY: The deck aims to turbo out Crystron Halqifibrax, everyone's favourite card of the format through a mass of tuners and extenders. As soon as you get to halq, you will combo off as I will detail below and draw at least 5 cards while doing this (Although 3 will be put back by saryuja), not to mention the plethora of Danger!'s you run, which are basically upstart goblins on legs. This basically gurantees drawing into one of your 6 copies of Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman, and you can also simply search it with a Buster Whelp if you draw it in your opening hand. At that point you just need 1 more extender to make infinite negates, with prologue being able to set up a the buster blader lock, which is basically a one-sided bagooska. You also gurantee having a dragon buster in your GY to resolve buster dragon's 3rd effect to equip buster lock too! If you do not draw into the buster whelp, the trap will likely be private knowledge, so you can do all that after your opponent activates something like Dark Ruler No More or Forbidden Droplets. This deck can play through handtraps to some degree if you are able to open enough extenders  &nbsp;  COMBO:  Basically any way to get to halq.  1.) Halq eff summon Buster Whelp from your deck. This is usually because it has the potential to be an extender later on which is important in this deck. If you hard draw the 1 copy of Dragon Buster, summon that instead 2.) Link Halq off into Linkross 3.) Linkross eff generating tokens in order to make synchro plays 4.) 1 token + the tuner to synchro summon Formula Synchron 5.) Formula eff to draw a card 6.) Formula + another token to synchro summon Metal Marcher in any zone EXCEPT the one directly under Linkross because we'll need it 7.) MMM eff to bring back your dragon tuner 8.) Link your dragon tuner off into an Elpy 9.) Link MMM and Linkross into a Protector Whelp directly above the Elpy 10.) Protector Whelp eff to dump the Dragon Buster from your deck. If you summoned DBDS off Halq, dump a card of your liking, preferably a Buster Whelp or a Destruction Sword Memories 11.) Elpy eff summoning brotaur from your deck 12.) Brotaur eff target itself to search Levianeer 13.) Link Brotaur into a Pisty in any zone so that Elpy and Protector Whelp still point to the same zone. This will probably be the right-most zone you can summon in. 14.) Pisty eff summon back anything (It doesn't really matter) 15.) Link all 4 of your monsters into a Saryuja 16.) Saryuja eff drawing 4 cards. You are more than likely going to have access to a trap trick/prologue at this point. If you don't...... I'm sorry 17.) Summon Levianeer from your hand by banishing Formula Synchron, Linkross and Protector Whelp (3 LIGHT monsters) 18.) Levianeer eff bring back anything (It doesn't matter) 19.) Saryuja eff summon a monster from your hand 20.) Summon an extender you may have drawn (you should have 9-10 still in your deck to draw off Saryuja. You also have the ability) 21.)  Link into a Reprodocus so that it points to a monster you control 22.) Reprodocus eff change your monster into a winged-beast 23.) Reprodocus + that monster into Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty 24.) Link the remaining 2 monsters into a Union Carrier 25.) Set prologue and use Carrier's eff to equip Mist Valley Thunderbird to Simorgh 26.) Proceed to the EP and use Simorgh's eff to summon Mist Valley Apex Avian from your deck 27.) During your opponent's turn: Activate Prologue and send Destruction Sword's Memories and a Buster Blader monster to summon Buster Dragon from your extra deck. 28.) Use Memories' GY eff to banish the Buster Blader and any dragon monster (Saryuja) in order to summon the Buster Blader fusion 29.) Use Buster Dragon's effect to equip Dragon Buster to the fusion  It was a long combo, but here is the endboard: Infinite Negates (Apex Avian + Thunderbird lock), an extra deck lock (Dragon Buster Destruction Sword) and a one-sided Bagooska/Skill Drain(Buster Blader fusion + Buster Dragon)  Overall, the deck is extremely consistent as it almost never needs you to draw specific cards and simply having extenders is usually good enough. This deck can also play a decent amount of handtraps because the ones we play are all tuners so one of them + an extender equals Halqifibrax. I've had a ton of fun with this deck and I hope you do too!"

I fixed Nordics. *deck begins to leak as all the duct tape starts to fall apart*,"<span>It's hard to do create a ""viable"" Nordic deck, isn't it? There are many issues plaguing the archetype and the most recent support actually hinders the archetype from making any play other than ""Summon Gullveig, banish cards go brrrrrr-"" and end up as Rata would put it, a ""boring, linear, defend the castle strategy"". On top of that is Alviss specific ""banish only this card"" clause combined with Gullveig's ""can't special summon other monsters other than Aesir"" clause creating one of the most suffocatingly specific summoning restrictions because it was the link era and Konami was too afraid that people could realistically summon more than one Aesir god at a time despite each God having such underwhelming and outdated effects for the amount of resources need to summon them. Bleh.</span>  <span>Now some of you may think that it sounds like I don't like the archetype but it is actually one of my most thematically favorite and something I played often back when synchro's were just becoming a thing.  </span>  <span>But enough talk, what is the strategy in this deck? Well it's pretty much a worse Needlefiber Linkross combo deck where Plan A is to summon a tuner and another monster to get out the combo or Plan B which is the classic Nordic defend the castle strategy. The way that this deck is ratio'd however is so that you can consistently rely on getting either Plan A (any monster + tuner into link synchro shenanigans, then ending it off with Gullveig into an Aesir God and calling it a day) on the field or Plan B (single Nordic into Gullveig go brrrrrrr-). Surprisingly after testing this deck, I managed to get Plan A most of the time starting with either Rescue Cat, Righty Driver, Double Summon, Dverg + Nordic tuner, T.G. swarm, etc. pretty consistently too. And if you can't get Plan A on board, then Plan B tends to be there most of the time as well. Plan A board tends to end with a negate or two (usually herald and/or F.A.) on the board plus an Aesir God through ending it with Gullveig and if you somehow survive a second turn, you can make even more monsters depending on the resources you have on hand (Pot of Avarice, Skull Dread, T.G. Hyper Librarian are all great ways to recycle/replenish back resources). Hop Ear Squadron is also an interesting card that can be useful in hand or deck. I find it neat to summon F.A. Dawn Dragster during my opponent's turn in those rare occasions while I have Hyper Librarian on the field.</span>  <span>As for weaknesses, it's pretty self evident. The deck may survive one disruption but two or more and it is over considering the amount of hand traps and omni-negates there are these days. Realistically this deck is best when going first but going second is...well...risky to say the least. The other problem is Gullveig's arrows pointing down which means your Aesir God will not receive Gullveig's protection if you are setting up with plan A since you would need a clever method to get rid of the link from your own extra monster zone. I'm pretty sure that it is possible to make an even better combo Nordic deck but I'm pretty much out of ideas at this point. I also feel like this deck could have some great potential if it had a new wave of support. Perhaps a new Aesir God (we have a whole pantheon, cmon Konami!) or just some new monsters and card effects that focuses getting multiple Aesirs on the field? All I wish is for is one of my favorite archetypes to get some awesome support being the Nordic Gods and all. . .  ; - ;</span>"

The main issue of this deck is the inability to fit handtraps.  The strategy depends on the opening hand. Most times, however, you will be going second, using Eldlich to dump him in the GY. Then, use his second effect to SS himself or another important zombie monster. Now, it is possible to Normal Summon a zombie monster to get your plays going, such as Hajun. Use Hajun to begin climbing to either The Skeletal Synchro, or the Link-4 Yuki.  The only way to disrupt your opponent is through Doomking and Link-4 Yuki.  Monsters:  3 Eldlich: Removes stuff from the field and allows us to play through at least one disruption most time. He is a starter.  1 Doomking: Revives himself and allows us to disrupt our opponent. Can run 2, if needed.  2 Necroworld Banshee: Can run at 1, I like her at 2 because she makes for really cheesy Doomking banish by chaining Doomking to her effect.  3 Uni-zombie: Allows the GY to get filled with zombies easily. Starter.  2 Dakki: Synergizes really well with Hajun, Doomking, and Link-4 Yuki. Run 2 because if she gets banished, the entire Mayakashi portion of the deck is no longer usable except for Yuki-Musume.  3 Hajun: Powerhouse starter, but also get ashed, veilered, and ogred easily. Run 3 because he is a great card to have in hand because he activates when Normal or Special Summoned.  1 Yuki-Musume: Amazing card, but if she gets banished, it is not the end of the world. Is a Foolish Burial in monster form.  1 Glow-Up Bloom: Do not want to draw him. He is an easy way to summon Doomking. Can replace a Link-4 Yuki in Extra Deck for a Linkuriboh for this guy.  Spells:  3 Mayakashi Return: Allows use to get any Mayakashi card to our hand or GY. Great card.  3 Eldlixir of Black Awakening: Easy Eldlich summon, or if Eldlich is already on board, allows for easy summon of any zombie.  3 Eldlixir of White Destiny: Easy Eldlich, or if Eldlich is already on board, allows for easy summon of GY Mayakashi Synchros to activate their effects. Can Run 2-3.  1 Foolish Burial: Can be used to dump Yuki-Musume, Necroworld Banshee, Eldlich, or Glow-Up Bloom.  3 Cursed Eldland: Easy way to get Eldlich in hand. Also allows us to get our ""Golden Land"" Traps easily.  3 Zombie World: Allows for Doomking to pop off, also floodgates some deck.  Traps:  3 Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine: Easy way to summon Eldlich, or if he is already on board, any other zombie. Also allows us to get our ""Golden Land"" Traps easily.  3 Conquistador of the Golden Land: With Eldlich on board, this guy is good non-target destruction and a body for Link Summons. Also, allows us to get those Eldlixir cards easily.  2 Huaquero of the Golden Land: Great way to rip apart opponents GY. Also, allows us to get the ""Eldlixir"" cards easily.  Extra Deck:  2 Of Each Mayakashi Synchro: Can run 1 of each if you really wanted to, or can run 1 of certain ones to make space for Linkuriboh.  2 Link-4 Yuki: Great card, negate field monster effect, and sets their ATK to 0. Fairly easy to get out. Synergizes well with Dakki. Also, negates the effects of banished monsters, which is very niche, but is great when it works.  1 Link-2 Yuki: Bad card, but makes for an easy way to get the Link-4 Yuki.  1 Vampire Sucker: Works great with Doomking, Eldlich, Yuki-Musume. Be careful though, Main Deck Mayakashis lock you out of non-Mayakashi Extra Deck.  1 Avendread Savior: Great at dumping cards to the GY. The same warning applies to this guy.  Side Deck:  1 One for One: Used to be in the deck, was replaced with Dakki but can be put back if needed.  3 Guardian of the Golden Land: This card is mainly used against Dragoon after Dragoon has already negated something. Is non-targeted ATK removal. This allows us to run over Dragoon with any non-0 ATK monster.  2 Golden Land Forever: Could make for good negate if needed.  1 Huaquero of the Golden Land: If the opponent relies on their GY heavily, this card is very useful."

Access R4NK or R8NK toolbox with your mass machinery and overwhelm your opponent! GOG","<em><strong>Deck Summary!~</strong></em>  This budget Gadget deck designed to primarily go second that utilizes the R4NK/R8NK toolbox to overwhelm and quickly OTK your opponent using gadgets and extenders.  While sub-optimal going first, this deck can still set up Bagooska/Time Thief (R4NK) and Number 38 (R8NK) for interruptions with 6 handtraps. This deck is better suited going second, breaking the board with the kaiju package (or if you're rich, Lightning Storm/Forbidden Droplet/Evenly Matched), and swinging for 10K damage with the utopia package. If the opponent is still standing after such an assault, Divine Arsenal can be overlayed on top of Utopia during main phase 2 for a board wipe during the opponent's turn.  <em><strong>Card Breakdown!~</strong></em>  <strong>The Gadgets</strong> are the main stars of this deck, allowing summon spam of rank 4s very quickly. Gold/Silver summon more 4 star machines and float into other gadgets. Resources are added to hand with the summons of Red, Yellow, and Green Gadgets.  This deck has three <strong>extenders</strong> - are Infinitrack Anchor Drill, also allowing rank 8s to be made (using it's effect) when summoned with another level 4 machine. Parallel Exceed can be special summoned for free from the hand when Platinum Gadget is link summoned, summoning another copy of itself from deck for a free rank 4. Boot-Up Corporal is another free 4 star machine given there are gadgets in the field/graveyard.  To break your opponent's board going second, the <strong>Kaiju Package</strong> is my budget friendly option. Kaijus tribute your opponent's problematic monsters away (like Dragoon or Borreload Savage), and can also wipe the board clean with Interrupted Kaiju slumber. Kaijus can then be dealt with your rank 4 toolbox, as they are only big beaters and have no inherent protection. If you have deep pockets and can afford Lightning Storm, Forbidden Droplet or Evenly Matched, I suggest using them in place of the handtraps/kaiju package in this deck for a more effective going second style. Dark Ruler No More is also a sidedeck option for board breaking too, I just don't like it because OTKs cannot be performed the turn it was used.  The <strong>handtraps</strong> of choice are Ash Blossom and PSY-Framegear Gamma in an effort to slow down your opponent before they can build a big board. Ash Blossom is currently expensive, so it can be switched out to Effect Veiler to drastically reduce this deck's price. Ghost Ogre/Droll/Impermance can also be used, depending on the match-up.  <strong>Divine Arsenal - Sky Thunder</strong> has not been released yet (as of the creation of this deck profile), and it will likely be incredibly expensive. Budget players, keep in mind that this card is optional and it isn't overly crucial to this deck's strategy.  <em><strong>Game Plan!~</strong></em>  After doing all we can slowing our opponent down with handtraps and breaking their board, we try to summon as many gadgets as possible along with our extenders Anchor Drill/Boot-Up Corporal -&gt; link summon Platinum Gadget -&gt; Special summon another machine to Platinum Gadget's zone/Special Summon Parallel Exceed to Platinum Gadget's zone -&gt; XYZ summon to our monster of choice using our R4NK or R8NK toolbox. Usually we try to swing for 10k into our opponent's monster/kaiju with the Utopia package. If the opponent is still standing after such an assault, Divine Arsenal can be overlayed on top of Utopia during main phase 2 for a board wipe during the opponent's turn.  <strong>Conclusion!~</strong>  Without the expensive cards of Ash Blossom and Divine Arsenal - Sky Thunder, this deck can be bought for about $50 USD!  This deck does a good at it's job of achieving it's purpose, board-breaking into an OTK, however, it falls to handtraps and has little to no grindgame. It is sub-optimal going first. This deck is one-dimensional, it's moves are highly telegraphed and can be dealt with accordingly by a prepared opponent. Overall, this deck is meant to be a weaker rogue/casual deck. However, this deck can still steal wins from the meta big boys and with that being said - GOGO POWER GADGETS!~"

Fur Hires can go 1st or 2nd and the end board slightly changes based on who's going first (Personally I think the deck shines going 2nd). If you are going 1st you want to summon Folgo as fast as you can then use his effect to play Filo so you can continue to special summon and to keep building up your board, and usually end on Folgo, Rafale, Wiz, and Linkuriboh so you have a monster effect negate and a spell/ trap negate and a way to weaken your opponent's monsters during battle. Going second your gonna wanna use Folgo and Filo again to build up your board and using different destruction effects  (i.e. cards like Raigeki, Donpa, and Recon) that way your opponent is open for attacks then you should end with Rafale, Folgo, and Saryuja (or one of the Borrels as well if you want a monster with protection instead). I know that Fur Hires are not the best deck but it has a really cool aesthetic and playstyle that I think with the right support can actually compete with some of the more competitive deck. Anyway, with that, I hope you guys like this decklist, and I am planning on posting more soon! ^^"

The deck is fine going second because of the Monarch engine but has good options going first with cards like Re-qliate/Skill Drain and Monarch Stormforth.  If played correctly you can get a lot of advantage, that said the deck is not easy to play if your not familiar with Qli´s.  As always don't copy a deck 1 to 1, add your flavor to it.  I love Qliphorts a lot and i´m working on them all the time to make them as good as possible."

So this is my first decklist so I am kinda new to this but I hope you guys enjoy this list!  So the deck is obviously Fortune Ladies, the idea behind this deck is to draw as many cards as possible to get the resources to summon a bunch of level 7 synchros. I tried to make the deck focus on summoning Fortune Lady Water and Fortune Lady Past ( Past cuz she's the tuner, and Water for her draw 2 effects). I use monsters like Light to help supplement the strategy and Dark to help recycle resources. The main spell that you are going to wanna see are Fortune Visions, Fortune Lady Calling, and Future Visions. Fortune Visions is great because it lets you search any card that has Fortune Lady in its name (This includes the spells and traps). Fortune Lady Calling special summons a fortune lady from your deck as long as it doesn't share a name of any other fortune ladies that you control (Keep this in mind if you already control a Water your gonna wanna get rid of that one before you can summon a new one from this spell), also this card does lock you into synchros. Future Visions is just a great spell card that stuns really hard! Also it can help activate Fortune Ladies effects like Light for example. So finally the Synchro you gonna wanna summon is Fortune Lady Every, Fortune Ladies new Boss monster, she not only has a self revival effect from the GY but also whenever she gains a level during the standby phase you can banish a face-up monster your opponent controls. To help with some spot removal I am using other levels 7 synchros like Arcanite magician, and interruption monsters like Clear Wing Synchro Dragon.  Anyway sorry if this description is kinda long-winded I am still super new to this, but in the end, thank you all for checking out my deck!"

This deck is very consistent and is easily the best deck of the metagame right now. Adding Dragonmaids to this deck is one of its upsides, chamber and parlor dragonmaid can easily use their effects to get 2 dragons to the field aka Romulus (full combo). </span>  &nbsp;  <span>I explain the deck and the COMBO, which results in 1 hand rip, 1 extra deck rip, banishing the top card of your opponents deck, having a true king of all calamities on the field (free win) and apollusa with 3 negates - all with just one of the 15 starters in the deck (dark ruler doesn't save the opponent as well) on my youtube video, please subscribe to my channel and like the video it is a great way to support me and the channel.

You are playing the high impact handtraps like droll and nibiru for this reason and playing gamma to ensure your combos goes off (sefert tribute itself, chaos space etc). Handtrap lineup is your choice, you can mix things up the way you like but you should definitely keep droll, nibiru and gamma - they are the most high impact handtraps in the game.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Extenders - 22</span></td> <td><span>You need extenders to extend your own combo if you get handtrapped - no explanation needed here.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Bricks - 4 </span>  <span>Special case bricks - 4</span></td> <td><span>There are 8 cards in this deck that you don’t usually want to draw but that does not mean ALL of them are bricks.

The deck I chose to take was my personal </span></span><span><span>build</span></span><span><span> o</span></span><span><span>f</span></span><span><span> Invoked Dogmatika. </span></span><span><span>I’ve been experimenting with Dogmatika </span></span><span><span>casually in the online space since they were announced. </span></span><span><span>I started testing the engine with the Invoked archetype after </span></span><span><span>I saw Nicolai Howlett’s top at the Prodigy Games ROTD Case tournament in August (Link to </span></span><span><span>d</span></span><span><span>eck </span></span><span><span>p</span></span><span><span>rofile </span></span><span><span><span><span lang=""zxx""><u>h</u></span></span></span></span><a>ere</a><span><span>). </span></span><span><span>I’ve made use of a lot of great guides and resources in the creation of this list so I’ll link all of them here, they’re all worth a look if you’re working on your own build: </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/dogmatika-invoked-4/"">lilthunderygo’s build</a><span><span>, </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/dogmatika-invoked-2/"">Smouv’s guide</a><span><span>, </span></span><span><span>and </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-tcg-banlist-2020-10/"">Seniorious’s build</a><span><span>. Special thanks to Seniorious for helping me with the techs and extra-deck the night before YCS 10. </span></span>  <span><span><b>2. Decklist and Techs</b></span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Main-deck: The Usual Suspects</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Aleister the Invoker x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>We begin </span></span><span><span>with one of the best normal summons of the year: Aleister the Invoker. </span></span><span><span>Playable in decks from Mek</span></span><span><span>k-</span></span><span><span>Knight to Eldlich he forms the summon portion of a 10-card Invoked engine that generates repeated negates and board presence turn after turn. If you are unfamiliar </span></span><span><span>the standard opening play is to find and normal summon Aleister before using his effect to search Invocation before linking him off for Salamangreat Almiraj and Secure Gardna in turn. This gives us materi</span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span>l in grave for not only summoning Invoked Mechaba this turn but also for summoning Invoked Purgatrio for a swift </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> next turn. </span></span><span><span>Another thing to note is Aleister’s second effect that allows us to boost the at</span></span><span><span>tac</span></span><span><span>k of</span></span><span><span><i> any fusion monster,</i></span></span><span><span> even during the damage step. This can be used to save one of our fusions from battle destruction or to help with our </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span> We have seven-</span></span><span><span>ish</span></span><span><span> main-deck copies of Aleister so </span></span><span><span>about a</span></span><span><span><b> 65%</b></span></span><span><span> to open one mak</span></span><span><span>es</span></span><span><span> this opening play highly consistent. I don’t think there's an Invoked build out there that wants to run less than three Aleisters so I’d stick with this ratio. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous x 3 </b></span></span>  <span><span>While this isn’t ideally your normal summon I thought it would make sense to group it here based on its effect. Dogmaticka Ecclesia, the Virtuous is another powerful searcher that, like Aleister, is the centre of a powerful advantage-generating engine. She can special summon herself from the hand “if there is a monster summoned from the extra deck on the field” </span></span><span><span>at which point she can search any Dogmatika card from the deck. This is easily accomplished on your first turn due to our above mentioned Aleister play allowing us to add another interruption to our opening board. </span></span><span><span>We play a total of six copies so you’ll be seeing Ecclesia about</span></span><span><span><b> 55%</b></span></span><span><span> of the time; you’ll see her and Aleister </span></span><span><span>together </span></span><span><span>about</span></span><span><span><b> 35%</b></span></span><span><span> of the time. </span></span><span><span>These are very good odds for a low investment two-to-three plus negates on your turn one board in my opinion, hence why I choose to play </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span>. If you’d like to experiment with less I have tried </span></span><span><span>two </span></span><span><span>in more budget-friendly builds. </span></span> <b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Maximus x 1 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Next up is a controversial one. Dogmatika Maximus can be a huge swing for either player depending on the composition of both players’ extra decks. This is all due to Maximus’s high-rolling effect that lets both players send two cards from the extra deck to the grave. If the Foolish goes off unpunished you can get a huge amount of set-up or removal for free, plus the value of milling your opponent’s extra deck for at least two. The most common way you’ll see this punished is with your opponent sending a couple of their own Elder Entity N’Tss to pop your board, although some still choose to play the Cyber Dragon Nova plus Invoked Mechaba combo. Since Maximus is searchable of off Ecclesia I don’t feel like you need to main-deck more copies but siding one-to-two more could be viable depending on if you think you’ll be punished for the effect or not. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>Finally we’ll finish out this look at the main-deck monsters with Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted. It’s searchable off of Ecclesia and Titaniklad the Ash Dragon’s effects like Maximus but unlike Maximus; Fleurdelis is a quick effect. As long as there’s an extra-deck monster on the field you can special-summon Fleurdelis from hand and then if there’s a Dogmatika monster on field you can negate one face-up monster’s effect. As I mentioned with Ecclesia it’s very likely you’ll end the first turn with an extra-deck monster on the field; so this effect is live on a minimum of<b> 70%</b> of your opening boards. Now due to the wording of Fleurdelis’s effect it can't be used to hit trigger effects that activate on the field such as Stratos-style search or permanent effects like Eldlich the Golden Lord’s attack gain on summon effect. Besides those this effect will hit most any other effect activation you might need it to. We run two for that reason and because its highly searchable off of Ecclesia and Nadir but you can try three if you value opening it more. </span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Spells and Traps</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Nadir Servant x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>We begin our look at the spells with the Dogmatika searcher Nadir Servant. For the price of one monster sent from the extra deck you can search any Dogmatika monster with an at</span></span><span><span>tac</span></span><span><span>k equal or less than the monster you sent. The most common targets for this effect tend to be Titaniklad to search Ecclesia or Fleurdelis, </span></span><span><span>or</span></span><span><span> N’Tss </span></span><span><span>to</span></span><span><span> pop. You can get a max</span></span><span><span>imum</span></span><span><span> of </span></span><span><span>two </span></span><span><span>pops and an effect negate on field with this line </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> add a Mechaba to this and you have our ideal opening board. It’s important to remember </span></span><span><span>that like Punishment this effect will lock you out of the extra-deck for the rest of the turn, so make sure to fusion summon first. I would recommend always playing three Nadir if you can as it is a fantastic consistency booster for your Dogmatika lines; it boosts our chances of opening Ecclesia to</span></span><span><span><b> 58%</b></span></span><span><span> going first. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Harpie’s Feather Duster x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>The bugbear of control decks stalks through our list. Beyond Eldlich there aren’t a ton of decks that want their back-row wiped so this becomes a powerful equalizer. This came in especially clutch against other Dogmatika decks as it allows us to clear their Punishment or Impermanence with zero risk to our monsters. Incidentally like our above-mentioned Lightning Storm, Harpie’s can completely blow out lesser control decks like Guru or Monarch. I would recommend running one of these in either the main or side deck if you can afford the space. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Triple Tactics Talent x 2 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Now on to our super-pushed Called By The Grave replacement. Triple looks broken on paper as it features three of YuGiOh’s most busted card effects. Depending on the situation you can either: draw two, scout your opponents hand and discard one, or take control of an opponent’s creature. Picking the right one at the right time can end games by itself, especially against tier three decks and below. We play two copies main to counter our opponent’s Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler on our Aleister or Meltdown on turn one. You could play less but I like having a<b> 33%</b> chance to open some kind of handtrap hate. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Mind Control x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Another tech from </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/seniorious/"">Seniorious</a> <span><span>here, </span></span><span><span>M</span></span><span><span>ind </span></span><span><span>Co</span></span><span><span>ntrol is a real blowout card going second. </span></span><span><span>Most often we use it </span></span><span><span>to bait out negates from the like of Herald or Savage Dragon, as if they don’t negate it we take their largest monster. As with most of our text it’s also a huge blowout against non-meta strategies. The only weakness of this tech is the lack of uses for a taken monster beyond trading up. </span></span><span><span>If you’d like to make this pick more synergistic then I’d maybe look at playing something like the Knightmares or I:P Masquerena in the extra </span></span><span><span>deck</span></span><span><span> if you can make the space. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Terraforming x 1 </b></span></span>  <span><span>So it should be obvious why we’re playing this as it’s a fourth copy of Meltdown. If it’s not obvious Meltdown is a starter that gives our fusion summons protection and Terraforming is just another copy. There is some potential synergy with other fusion spells like Secret Village of the Spellcasters or Magical Mid-Breaker Field in order to keep Terraforming live later in the game. I would always include this in an Invoked build but if you want to drop it expect the consistency to drop.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Invocation x 3 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Invocation needs no introduction these days as one of the greatest fusion spells of all time, next to Red-Eyes Fusion. It allows us to fusion summon <i>any monster </i>and if it’s an Invoked monster we can use materials from the hand, field, or either graveyard. This can be huge as it allows us to use our follow-up plays to clear problem cards from our opponent’s graveyard. This can be used to turn problem floaters like Eldlich the Golden Lord into a Mechaba on the follow-up. Also of note is Invocation's graveyard effect that allows us to recycle our banished Aleisters for follow-ups or the convenient attack boosting effect. We run three Invocation for the increased chance to open it as Aleister’s effect attracts negates like no other and we want our opening to be consistent. You can run two if you don’t want to open it but be wary of handtraps if you do. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Super Polymerization x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Onto one of the last bad calls I made in this build. Super Polymerization is an incredible card in any fusion-based deck with flexible materials as it lets you clear threats in a way that your opponent cannot respond too. The thought for playing it here was that I could use it as a way to resolve a negated Aleister without drawing Invocation. This worked in testing against less meta strategies but struggled against the superior tempo of the tier one decks. I could see a place for this in a budget Invoked build but for meta Forbidden Droplet is a better choice. Try this if you’d like but I don’t recommend it. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Magical Meltdown x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Magical Meltdown is an essential inclusion. It functions as four more copies of Aleister and allows us to protect our fusion monsters and summons. I’ve also found it useful to bait out Ash Blossom or the occasional Ghost Ogre in scenarios where we draw Aleister and Meltdown. In the updated build I often send Magical Meltdown for Forbidden Droplet as once you’ve searched Aleister and fusion summoned it’s better to get it off the field for the plus two. Overall there's no reason to run less than three of this in any build in my opinion. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Punishment x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>The f</span></span><span><span>inal card of our main-deck </span></span><span><span>is</span></span><span><span> one of my favourite cards in the deck. </span></span><span><span>Dogmatika Punishment is one of </span></span><span><span>only</span></span><span><span> a few playable trap cards in the current format, next to the previously mentioned Infinite Impermanence. </span></span><span><span>Punishment allows us to send a card from the extra deck to pop a monster with equal or lower attack than the monster we sent. </span></span><span><span>Half the extra deck is geared around this effect so there are a number of optimal targets depending on your situation. I’ll mention a couple here but you’ll find the rest below. The two I find myself sending on my opponent’s first turn most are N’Tss for the dual pop or Titaniklad for the follow-up Ecclesia or Maximus play. It’s important to note that Punishment locks you out of summoning till the end of your next turn, so use with caution if you plan to follow-up with Purgatrio. Some builds run two of this </span></span><span><span>b</span></span><span><span>ut I chose three in anticipation of grindy mirrors, and this payed off, however I would caution against that choice going forward. With more coverage of the deck the player base </span></span><span><span>is</span></span><span><span> likely to start siding against this strategy specifically. Expect more blowout cards and shorter games going forward. </span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Side Deck and Tech Choices</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Notes on the side </b></span></span>  <span><span>Normally I wouldn’t go into a lot of depth on the side deck as I tend to feel like sides are best as personal calls made by players with a specific meta in mind. On this occasion I've decided to analyze my picks here as I feel the meta of YCS 10 is worth exploring. Hopefully this approach helps you all make better siding choices in future events this year, as we’re not seeing a banlist update till December 15th at the earliest (<a>Source</a>). We’ll start with the side deck and my reasons for playing them before going over the main-deck tech cards in the same fashion. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Nibiru, the Primal Being x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>We begin our look at the side deck with </span></span><span><span>the format staple Nibiru, </span></span><span><span>the bane of combo decks everywhere. Now rarely alone is this enough to stop tier-one combo decks like Dragonlink or Infernoble but you need to understand this card in terms of its place among other disruption. I board this in going second in hopes of drawing it with another powerful handtrap like Gamma </span></span><span><span>which can be enough to buy me a turn to set up my </span></span><span><span>more recursive</span></span><span><span> negates. This happens about </span></span><span><span><b>10% </b></span></span><span><span>of the time so I wouldn't count on it if you're expecting a higher density of Dragonlink than I was. </span></span><span><span>Against anything under tier three or so Nibiru is absolutely devastating even by itself as most decks</span></span> <span><span>don’t have enough extenders to continue their combo or setup. </span></span><span><span>I ended up resolving this way more in practise than I did in the tourn</span></span><span><span>ament</span></span><span><span>. I’d chalk that up to the density of rogue decks in my practise environment as opposed to any of my </span></span><span><span>match-ups</span></span><span><span> being Nibiru-proof or something. If you expect a high density of </span></span><span><span>Dino</span></span><span><span>saur</span></span><span><span> or Infernoble</span></span><span><span> I’d take this out in favour of mass removal, but for most general </span></span><span><span>match-ups</span></span><span><span> this is a good pick at three. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Droll &amp; Lock Bird x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>On to Droll &amp; Lock </span></span><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>ird, a necessity against many of the same decks mentioned above. </span></span><span><span>Droll has a storied history in various decks, most notably Trickstar with the dreaded Droll loop. </span></span><span><span>Today we play </span></span><span><span>Droll &amp; Lock </span></span><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>ird</span></span><span><span> for much the same reason we play Nibiru: to fade Dragonlink and Infernoble going second, and to crush rogue-tier decks like Numeron variants and Adamancipator before they can build powerful boards. It can come in clutch in the mirror as well </span></span><span><span>due to how many opportunities you have to activate it</span></span> <span><span>such as Nadir Servant or Magical Meltdown. </span></span><span><span>As with all of the handtraps I play at three you have a</span></span><span><span><b> 33%</b></span></span><span><span> chance to open a single copy of this, so I wouldn’t cut down on them if you value being able to play against meta. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Effect Veiler x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>This will be the first of a few bad calls I made going into the tournament that I’m going to discuss in this guide. Effect Veiler is a solid handtrap in a vacuum due to it essentially being three more copies of Impermanence. In addition it has a fantastic typing for the Selene combos that many decks are using to summon Accesscode Talker. I chose to side Effect Veiler because I was expecting to see a lot more Mekk-Knight Girsu and other Aleisters than I ended up seeing. Due to my match-ups this ended up being a waste of space as I didn’t run into any of the decks I was expecting beyond the stray Dogmatika variant. I’ll go over why Impermanence was useful below but for now I would suggest switching this for some back-row hate like Cosmic Cyclone or Twin Twisters. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Lightning Storm x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Unlike the above choice this ended up being incredibly useful. I sided Lightning Storm against every non-meta deck I faced to simply disgusting results. One game my opponent managed to resolve three copies of Evenly Matched against me going first; I won a turn after I resolved Lightning Storm for a plus-three. In terms of why this works so well right now I’d point to its use as a must-negate to draw out the ever present Herald and Savage Dragon along with the lack of Solemns outside of niche control decks and Eldlich. Lightning Storm is even better in conjunction with any form of mass negates like Forbidden Droplet or the option I sided, Dark Ruler No More. I would recommend playing this with one of those options as I think it doesn't do enough on its own this format against meta. All said I continue to run three of these in my side and I’d suggest you do the same. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dark Ruler No More x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Next up </span></span><span><span>is </span></span><span><span>our answer to the powerful Dragoon boards that filled out some </span></span><span><span><b>57% </b></span></span><span><span>of all decks in the tourn</span></span><span><span>ament</span></span><span><span>. I’ve never enjoyed needing to side in Dark Ruler </span></span><span><span>No More</span></span><span><span> as it’s not the most interactive, but this meta necessitates it. In </span></span><span><span>c</span></span><span><span>onjunction with the a</span></span><span><span>fore</span></span><span><span>mentioned Lightning Storm it can clear almost anything; </span></span><span><span>its also consistent </span></span><span><span>at about a</span></span><span><span><b> 1</b></span></span><span><span><b>4</b></span></span><span><span><b>%</b></span></span> <span><span>chance </span></span><span><span>to see them both together </span></span><span><span>going second. Now admittedly in my updated build I’ve switched this for Forbidden Droplet as I think it’s slightly better due to its discard effect stopping a wi</span></span><span><span>d</span></span><span><span>er range of interruptions. Either option could be good here depending on the specific meta you’r</span></span><span><span>e</span></span><span><span> expecting so I’d recommend testing both before taking this out. </span></span>  <span><span><b>PSY-Framegear Gamma x 3 and PSY-Frame Driver x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>We’re done looking at the side so onto the main-deck hand-traps and techs now, starting with the PSY-Frames. I’ve grouped them together as you’re never playing one without the other. Gamma is probably the most impactful hand</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>rap of modern YuGiOh due to its powerful monster-effect negate and summoning condition preventing </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span>s. The negate is so powerful due to its ability to hit any monster effect no mat</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>er where it’s activated, including most other handtraps. We main-deck the Gamma package because of its versatility </span></span><span><span>and ability to hit everything in the meta, as like with the rest of our three-ofs we have a</span></span><span><span><b> 33%</b></span></span><span><span> to open it going second. The one down side to Gamma is the need to play an extra Garnet in the form of Driver and of course Gamma itself can be a soft Garnet going first. None of the downsides outweigh the vast positives in my opinion so I’d keep this in the main deck for the foreseeable future. If you really don’t like Gamma you could always main Nibiru instead, but it didn’t preform as well in my testing.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>On to another bad call now, Ash Blossom was not worth main-decking in this event. I think that like Effect Veiler, Ash Blossom is good in a vacuum, but in the current meta I found myself siding in Droll &amp; Lock Bird for Ash Blossom going second every time. I’ve subsequently switched Ash Blossom for Droll &amp; Lock Bird in my latest build — if you intend to to play in this meta I’d recommend you do the same. Ash Blossom could be good in the side deck against certain match-ups like Gren Maju or anything that plays Pot of Desires or Pot of Extravagance but I didn’t see enough of that to justify it. One thing to note about Ash Blossom is that it can be used with Invocation to summon a follow-up Purgatrio due to its convenient attribute. Overall I wouldn’t count on Ash Blossom right now, but if you’re really attached to it or on a budget, it’ll do. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Infinite Impermanence x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Now onto the last handtrap I chose to main: Infinite Impermanence. You’re probably familiar with Impermanence from the last few metas and Altergeist specifically. We play it here to use with our PSY-Framegear Gamma, Droll &amp; Lock Bird, or Nibiru to have a chance going second versus tier one of the meta. It’s especially useful due to it being a trap, as if we draw it going second (<b>40%</b> or so) we can use it with Mechaba to negate our opponent’s Dogmatika Punishment or Impermanence. This can also be a valid reason to keep it in your hand going first. As with a large portion of our handtraps Impermanence smashes non-meta strategies, often without the need for other handtraps. Overall it’s worth playing in meta events if you can afford the deck space or cost.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Dinowrestler Pankratops x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Finally onto the first and only tech choice I elected to mention in this section. </span></span><span><span>I was alerted to this tech by </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/seniorious/"">Seniorious</a><span><span> and I have to say it ended up coming in clutch several times. I would attribute this to the huge amount of Mekk-Knight that </span></span><span><span>I ended up seeing as their in-archetype negates are tied to continuous spells and traps. Pankratops’s effect hits these regardless of whos</span></span><span><span>e</span></span><span><span> turn it is and worst case you blow up a monster. I was hoping it would be an effective out to Dragoon as well and that proved to be correct as it hits </span></span><span><span>Predaplant </span></span><span><span>Verte </span></span><span><span>Anaconda</span></span><span><span> hard. Additionally we can use Pankratops in the grave to summon Magellancia for help with the </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> on the follow-up. This tech worked fantastically against several decks </span></span><span><span>and</span></span><span><span> I would advise keeping this in for the foreseeable future. </span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Extra Deck</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Elysium x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>We s</span></span><span><span>tart our look at the extra deck with another of my bad calls: Invoked Elysium. Unlike many of the others this was a bad call with some data to back it up. </span></span><span><span>Elysium tested well against Dragonlink specifically as </span></span><span><span>in</span></span><span><span><b> 66%</b></span></span><span><span> of the</span></span><span><span> games it was summoned </span></span><span><span>i</span></span><span><span>t</span></span> <span><span>ended within three turns in my favour. This may not be directly because of Elysium </span></span><span><span>due to variable skill in my practise environment, but I digress.</span></span><span><span> I took it at face value and brought Elysium in favour of</span></span> <span><span>a third N’Tss or Invoked Raidjin for summoning with spent Droll &amp; Lock </span></span><span><span>Birds. </span></span><span><span>In retrospect either of those would have been better choices as I saw maybe one Dragonlink player the whole day. For future builds I’m experimenting with some new tech to hit the increase in Dogmatika builds but a third N’Tss is probably just as good. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Mechaba x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>O</span></span><span><span>ne of the best cards in the extra, Invoked Mechaba is at the centre of most of our first-turn boards. </span></span><span><span>If you’re unfamiliar, Mechaba can negate and banish </span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span> card providing you discard a card of the same type. This can be tremendously useful </span></span><span><span>in conjunction with our Dogmatika package as it gives us access additional negates as well as consistent access to traps and monsters to fuel Mechaba’s effect. Aside from that primary use, Mechaba has the secondary use of being materi</span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span>l for follow-up Augoeides play</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> when needed. </span></span><span><span>I don’t think there’s any reason to run three Mechaba but one might be fine if you don’t value the </span></span><span><span>Augoeides </span></span><span><span>follow-up as much.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Magellancia x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>The f</span></span><span><span>inal tech from </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/seniorious/"">Seniorious</a> <span><span>and a follow-up to the Pankratops mentioned above, Invoked Magellancia is here to assist with the </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> line from hands where we draw Pankratops. It can be useful with Punishment on occasion if you need to hit a 3</span></span><span><span>000-attack</span></span><span><span> threat like </span></span><span><span>Nibiru or Bo</span></span><span><span>r</span></span><span><span>relsword </span></span><span><span>Dragon</span></span><span><span>. If you’d prefer not to run Pankratops then this is obviously not worth it; </span></span><span><span>in that case </span></span><span><span>I’d recommend running Invoked Raidjin for synergy with main-deck Droll &amp; Lock Bird </span></span><span><span>instead.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Titaniklad the Ash Dragon x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>Enter the last piece of our Dogmatika engine: Titaniklad the Ash Dragon. This is played exclusively to send off of our Dogmatika Punishment or Nadir Servant to maintain our tempo and board presence. We can use its graveyard effect to special summon or add to hand any Dogmatika monster from our deck at the end of the turn we sent it to the grave. This is most useful for getting a main-deck follow-up on the turns you’re locked out of the extra by Punishment. You normally want to do this by special summoning Ecclesia during your opponent’s end phase and using her effect to search either another Punishment or Fleurdelis. Punishment is good for stalling your opponent’s plays for a turn if you don’t have the card advantage to close out the game. Fleurdelis is useful for clearing extra-deck threats and closing out games with its attack-boosting effect. There is some debate around how many of these is optimal; personally I settled on two because I was anticipating longer matches. I’ve gone into detail about how that turned out above but suffice it to say if you’re expecting quicker games, I’d cut this down to one. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Augoeides x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>One of our last Invoked extra-deck monsters, Invoked Augoeides is a powerful and unexpected threat. </span></span><span><span>It’s an excellent way to punish your opponent on the follow-up for destroying your first-turn Mechaba. Aside from that it’s also a pop when your opponent special summons which can be very hard for some decks such as Salamangreat or other Dogmatika to out cleanly. Augoeides is also a fantastic </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> enabler due to its attack-boosting effect as you’re likely to have at least a</span></span><span><span>n</span></span><span><span> N’Tss or Titaniklad in grave </span></span><span><span>on </span></span><span><span>turn one. </span></span><span><span>This translates to an Augoeides with at least 4400 a</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>ac</span></span><span><span>k, plus potentially a Purgatrio or Magellancia on the follow-up for a total of at least 7000 damage on board turn three. </span></span><span><span>Personally I like running one of these but if you’d like to go heavier on the Dogmatika synergy you could replace this with an extra N’Tss or Wind Pegasus if you'd prefer. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Purgatrio x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>On to our final Invoked monster and OTK enabler: Invoked Purgatrio. Regardless of what client you play on you’re probably familiar with Purgatrio as it has been consistently popular since its release in both Duel Links and the TCG. It’s easy to get out thanks to our first-turn Aleister line with Almiraj on the follow-up, where its multi-attack effect and piercing damage are most relevant. Judicious use of Purgatrio on the follow-up is our answer to decks like Guru and their irritating walls, as the innate attack boost plus Aleister’s hand effect is enough to get over a boosted Guru for big damage. I wouldn’t run any less than one of these but more is probably a waste of extra deck space.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Fossil Warrior Skull Knight x 1 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Done with the fusions we actually aim to summon, we can continue with Fossil Warrior Skull Knight. Despite the obvious synergy a lot of people seem to be surprised to see this one. For the unenlightened we run Skull Knight for his graveyard effect: if we remove him from play we can target and pop an opponent’s monster. Now you might be asking why we’d play this over a third N’Tss since they do basically the same thing, right? Well, not exactly. You see, sometimes we want to pop an opponent’s monster without telegraphing N’Tss. To this end we use Skull Knight to send off of Punishment to pop on the following turn. This can be hard to deal with without a Towers or Called By The Grave specifically as almost no one is on Ghost Belle in this format. Overall this is a good option right now as some decks are starting to expect N’Tss, but you could just play another N’Tss if you wanted. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Elder Entity N’Tss x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>I’ve mentioned N’Tss many times at this point as has all other Dogmatika coverage </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> it might as well be a part of the archetype. </span></span><span><span>On the most basic level N’Tss allows us to double Punishment’s pop, turn Nadir into a pop, or turn Maximus into two pops. </span></span><span><span>This is so well known that even non-Dogmatika decks are playing her as a way to punish the rise in Maximus. Despite how telegraphed it is, this will still catch less experienced players off guard so I’d advi</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>e caution when firing off Maximus. Overall there’s not a ton to say about N’Tss that hasn’t already been said; I’d advise playing between two and three in </span></span><span><span>this build</span></span><span><span> and potentially one to two in anything else </span></span><span><span>with the space</span></span><span><span>.</span></span>  <span><span><b>PSY-Framelord Omega x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Second-to-last Punishment target now and a key piece in our grind-game, Omega is a well-known tool for recycling banished cards to the point that it finds itself on the </span></span><span><span>L</span></span><span><span>imited list. We use it here for just that, recycling our </span></span><span><span>resources like N’Tss or Punishment while still keeping any remaining </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish effects live. I’ve tested the deck without Omega but I would recommend against this as any games going past turn four start to </span></span><span><span>put significant strain on your extra deck resources. If you’d like to do without Omega I would perhaps recommend playing Cyber Dragon Nova as a way to cheat out your second Mechaba to close out games faster against Dogmatika, as they tend to be our grindiest match-up. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Wind Pegasus @Ignister x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>At last we arrive at our last Punishment target and only non-destruction removal aside from Super Polymerization in this build. Wind Pegasus @Ignister is powerful in much the same way N’Tss is, although slightly more restricted due to its effect triggering when a card is destroyed. The benefit over N’Tss is that Wind Pegasus shuffles a card back into the deck. Now this does target so regrettably it won’t hit Dragoon and the like, but it’s very much worth playing right now due to the popularity of Dinosaur and Infernoble. I’ve experimented with two of these in favour of a third N’Tss and it shows promise as out of the six games played with that build specifically, four of them resolved at least one Pegasus by turn three and two by turn five (providing the game lasted that long). I think that might be worth some more testing in the future, and you can bet that if I make a follow-up to this guide I’ll be sure to have a more definitive answer then. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Secure Gardna x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Finally we can look at the deck’s small array of links, starting with Secure Gardna. Gardna is mostly here to link off Aleister by way of Almiraj to get a </span></span><span><span>L</span></span><span><span>ight on field and Aleister in the grave. This is an incredibly consistent opening as almost </span></span><span><span><b>70% </b></span></span><span><span>of hands can accomplish this line. Aside from that Gardna doesn’t see much use outside of matches against Mystic Mine decks. In one such game I used Gardna to totally negate the effect of their burn win-con</span></span><span><span>dition</span></span><span><span> long enough for me to draw my Harpie’s Feather Duster, after which the game swiftly ended. I would advise against playing more or less of this as one seems to be optimal in my testing. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Salamangreat Almiraj x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>L</span></span><span><span>ast extra-deck card now, and final piece of the above-mentioned line with Gardna. Salamangreat Almiraj is played here simply to get our Aleister and itself in grave for the summon of Mechaba turn one and Purgatrio on the following turn. Its effect comes up rarely as a way to keep a Fleurdelis or </span></span><span><span>Magellancia</span></span><span><span> alive </span></span><span><span>to assist with lethal in situations where you have the chance to special </span></span><span><span>summon</span></span><span><span> it with it</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> owns effect. Aside from that I have little to say about this card, like above don’t </span></span><span><span>play any less if you value the consistent opening play. </span></span>  <span><span><b>3. Combo Guide</b></span></span>  <span><span>Before I begin going over the hands I’ve picked out I’d like to go over who this section is for. Simply put, if you’re a more experienced player I’d recommend skipping this as I’m writing it for those who are new to the deck. I’ll be going over three types of hands that make up<b> </b><b>87%</b> of all hands the deck produces. If you’d like a more in-depth combo guide versus meta, I’ll be posting an addendum to The Yu-Gi-Oh Writers Guild (see Final Thoughts). </span></span>  <span><span><b>1) Aleister the Invoker </b></span></span>  <span><span>The first hand </span></span><span><span>I’ll be covering is any hand with access to just Aleister. This can be through Meltdown or Terraforming so remember to resolve those first if needed. We start by normal summoning Aleister and using his effect to search Invocation before linking him off for Almiraj. From Almiraj we link summon Secure Gardna to get ourselves access to a </span></span><span><span>L</span></span><span><span>ight monster for summoning Mechaba with Invocation. Next we do just that before ending on Mechaba and any traps you drew. This leaves us with an omni-negate at minimum plus an average of one handtrap and/or one trap card (</span></span><span><span><b>66%</b></span></span><span><span> of hands draw Aleister plus a trap or handtrap,</span></span><span><span><b> 20%</b></span></span><span><span> draw Aleister plus one of each). From here you should have </span></span><span><span>enough negates to stall your opponent’s strategy long enough to finish them on the follow-up. Said follow-up is normally </span></span><span><span>accomplished by</span></span><span><span> summoning Purgatrio with the Aleister we add back off of Invocation’s grave effect </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> providing they didn’t manage to out our Mechaba </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> for some 6000 </span></span><span><span>or so</span></span><span><span> damage on board with piercing. </span></span><span><span>If they outed our Mechaba, Augoeides is a better follow-up as its on-summon effect allows us to stall our opponent for longer while pushing for damage with its at</span></span><span><span>tac</span></span><span><span>k</span></span><span><span>-</span></span><span><span>boosting effect. From this position the game should be over </span></span><span><span>shortly depending on your opponent and their draws. </span></span>  <span><span><b>2) Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</b></span></span>  <span><span>Next up is Ecclesia, normally an extender, but there will be hands without Aleister where this is your best normal summon. Ecclesia can be special summoned providing there is a monster summoned from the extra deck on the field, and on summon she searches any Dogmatika card. The most common targets for this are Punishment, Fleurdelis, or Maximus on occasion. As an aside I would caution using Maximus on the first turn against unknown decks as many strategies are either running picks to punish us generally or running N’Tss and Punishment sincerely as an engine. Aside from that, most of the time you’ll want to search Punishment providing you didn’t draw it for the potential two pops it provides. This will leave you with at least Punishment plus a<b> 40% </b>chance of a handtrap in your opener to get you through your opponent’s turn. This is obviously not as good as the above mentioned Aleister line but its important to remember we are aiming to open and resolve both lines simultaneously. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what to do if you don’t open the full combo. </span></span>  <span><span><b>3) Aleister + Ecclesia </b></span></span>  <span><span>Our final hand to go over is the deck’s best hand and standard opener in the cases we draw it. </span></span><span><span>We have a</span></span><span><span><b> 35%</b></span></span><span><span> to open this hand </span></span><span><span>which is not bad for the number of negates it puts up.</span></span><span><span> To get started you want to be opening some form of Aleister and Ecclesia, </span></span><span><span>although if you didn’t open Ecclesia herself be careful not to activate Nadir Servant before fusion summoning. Speaking of which, your first step to resolving this hand is </span></span><span><span>the same as the first hand we covered. Normal summon Aleister, link into Almiraj and Gardna ,then use Invocation to summon Mechaba with Gardna and Aleister in grave before adding back Aleister with Invocation’s graveyard effect. </span></span><span><span>From here we</span></span> <span><span>can execute our Dogmatika plays starting with getting Ecclesia on the field by her own effect. As a note if you’re resolving Nadir Servant to search Ecclesia at this point I’d advise sending Titaniklad to add Fleurdelis to your hand at end step for the effect negate. That aside, we search Punishment of off Ecclesia to add an additional two pops to the omni-negate and potential effect-negate we already covered. </span></span><span><span>The follow-up from this point is similar to the first hand we covered in that we want to summon either Purgatrio or Augoeides </span></span><span><span>for a swift </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span>. This is assisted by Fleurdelis who you’ve either summoned on your opponent’s turn or are summoning by its own effect as a follow-up. All told if you get everything on board that I’ve mentioned you’ll have some 9500 damage </span></span><span><span>to finish off your opponent and hopefully the game soon after. </span></span>  <span><span><b>4. Final Thoughts</b></span></span>  <span><span>At last we reach the end of this deck guide! I’m really grateful to anyone who read this far.

We hope to see you there soon.</span></span>  <span><span>Before I finish this I’d just like to go over my final thoughts on the deck and its future. </span></span><span><span>Overall I was very impressed with the performance of the deck, despite the hostility of the current meta. The gap between tie</span></span><span><span>r-</span></span><span><span>one decks and all other viable strategies is staggering, but despite being tier two at best Invoked Dogmatika managed to steal wins from the best of them. Both of my losses were the result of getting out-tempoed in game three by grindier decks like Eldlich </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> for your sake I’d recommend changing up the side-deck to avoid this. As far as the future of the archetypes involved go I’d say that </span></span><span><span>Invoked will continue to be meta for as long as it goes un-hit on the banlist. </span></span><span><span>D</span></span><span><span>espite being three years old at this point, Aleister is still one of the best normal summons in the game </span></span><span><span>and Mechaba’s negate will continue to be relevant regardless due to it banishing. As far as Dogmatika goes Konami seems to revealing more and more </span></span><span><span>indirect </span></span><span><span>support for it as time goes by. With the release of </span></span><span><span>Brigand the Glory Dragon next month </span></span><span><span>and Splind the Steelexpress Dragon sometime next year we</span></span><span><span>’ll soon be able to jam Dogmatika </span></span><span><span>with Tri-Brigade </span></span><span><span>and Sprigguns.</span></span><span><span> I’ve not tested </span></span><span><span>either</span></span><span><span> myself but the results look promising. </span></span><span><span>Until next time</span></span><span><span>, stay safe </span></span><span><span>duellists</span></span><span><span>!</span></span>"

It is always important that Mighty Guard delivers the finishing blow, otherwise it is pointless having him in the deck other than to just look pretty, which he does!"

Prime Photon detaching Afterglow gets boosted to 11200 on its own, so you can OTK over anything with 3200 or less.  Photon Sanctuary is basically RotA, it makes Union Carrier to equip Orbital which searches your entire deck. Usually you'll search Galaxy Soldier then with that search Galaxy Knight, but you might search either of your big dragons too. It's also non-OPT, so multiples let you summon your other links for free.  Galaxy Trance is amazing for pushing through interruption. As long as you have Photon Dragon in grave, it summons it and then Afterglow from deck. NOTE: You're locked out of the Union Carrier play if you want to do this.  No Galaxy Expedition because it just bricks us more. Hyper Galaxy is potentially strong, especially since it summons a Photon Dragon, but in practice its a huge minus if it whiffs and some boards don't have a 2000+ atk monster.  Don't be afraid to summon Photon Dragon by it's own effect if you already have Afterglow in hand, but always be sure your Prime Photon will stick before you specifically commit to it.  If you expect to go first games 2 or 3 just side in the Dragon Buster and equip it to Hope Harbinger. If you specifically want to go first though, the Warrior/Isolde version is probably better for it.  Have fun!!"

Xyz revive splash is used to rank-up Number 101 or Bahamut Shark (after it's summoned another xyz) into either Valiant Lancer or Silent Honor Dark. When going second, utilize Utopia double and the White Aura Synchros to potentially OTK your opponent. 3 Moray of Greed can be replaced with other consistency boosting cards (Instant Fusion is one possibility). The Extra deck can be further edited to account for personal preference (running more copies of Toad is certainly viable even though the card can recur itself). Note: As of the current date on which this profile was submitted, some cards in the list have not yet been imported into the TCG."

If you know how to use Mayakashi's then you're good. But for those that don't know, here's a quick info. Mayakashi's work when there's one of its name on the field, Meaning you can't summon two Yasha's on the field at the same time so you're stuck with the one. Also, Mayakashi's work by using their Synchro Summoning method, but make sure you read the effects of the Mayakashi Synchro Monsters and know what you're gonna summon. Also, for the Synchro Summoning method, if you used Dakki for a Synchro, then you're gonna use her over and over and over again for MANY synchro summoning for Mayakashi Synchros, because Dakki gets special summoned if a Mayakashi Synchro monster was special summoned from the extra deck.  This deck also has other cards that'll help special summon monsters from your graveyard, including Mayakashi Synchro monsters to activate their effects to help turn things around if you're low on monsters and you need a wall. Every Mayakashi Synchro monster special summoned from the grave, their effects are activated and depending which you use, they are helpful to get your opponent in a difficult position.  Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon is in this deck that can help because of its effect in gaining 100 ATK and DEF for the zombies in your field or graveyard. You can add Zombie World field spell but that's only if you want to make the deck become a competitive deck, but seeing I made this for fun, this is what you get.  As for your side cards, you can get some combos if you got Robbin' Zombie and special summoned from the grave Tsuchigumo, the Poisonous Mayakashi. World Legacy Succession is there incase if you want to use this deck for Master Rule 5 game so it MIGHT be useful for your Synchro monsters in the grave, but I cannot confirm this at this time of typing this description."

CHAZZ IT UP,"The main objective of this deck is to get ADT lv10 out as consistently as humanly possibly, however Dragoon is the better win condition, so aim for that if you can.  Best endboard I remember getting is dragoon, ADT lv10, AD lightning and 3 blank cards in hand, however the most likely end board is either dragoon or ADT lv10 + AD lightning on field with 3-4 cards in hand. The deck can often play through 1 negate, but usually never more than that.  Deck was tested on Edopro casual servers, and has decent matchups. I would put this deck at tier 3/rouge, however it is probably just garbage haha. Armed Dragons would have better synergy with dragon link,  rather than ojama but I haven't figured out how to make that work yet.  *DECKBUILDING NOTES*  This deck is built with consistency as its number 1 priority, so if a card wasn't consistent, it was cut.  Ojama pajama and Ojamagic are not being run as they are way too sacky, inconsistent, etc.  AD lv10- white, could be played but I think Arma gram is <em>slightly</em> better  upstart isn't played as it can brick with Extravagance  Volcanic shell can be played - but space issues  AD blitz and AD thunderbolt can be played - but space issues  A second ADT lv10 is not recommended - too many issues  Lightning storm and evenly matched can be ANY card you want.  *DUELING NOTES*  I'm finding most success in 3 match duels where I go second on the first duel, where afterwards I side 5 solemn negates and I choose to go first. No one really knows how this deck works so mind gaming your opponent is where it's at right now.  Don't activate ojama pinks effect unless your hand is garbage,  it's only helping your opponent find a hand trap and thin their deck.  It's ALWAYS better to make a Dragoon endboard rather than ADT endboar; if you have a choice but can't do both.  This deck has no recursion. Once ADT lv10 and dragoon die you will only have arma gram and tempest as win conditions - so play with that in mind  Combo's are all very simple - nothing you won't figure out by yourself :)"
