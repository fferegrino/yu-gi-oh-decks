Crow is for an allure target and as well as the meta has graveyard effect.  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Allure of darkness z It's really meant to help me dig deeper in my deck. Sometime I'll banish Dark magician cause I'll make 2 work or rod if I already normal <span class=""hiddenSuggestion"">summon</span> him the same turn</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Foolish burial goods - It send cards I need to help draw or the navigation to negate a spell/trap effect for a turn. Send <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">metalfoes</span> to shuffle and draw or soul servant to draw.</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"">Metalfoes</span> fusion z This card is great, like an upstart. If it's in the starting hand there are plenty of cards that will discard, souls being the best one cause you draw one and shuffle and draw another. </span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Soul servant - It's funny how its first effect let's you stack your deck. But it's great how it <span class=""hiddenGrammarError"">can be</span> any dark magician card (expect eye of Timaeus). Normally I just use DM to draw but if there's <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">DMG</span> than it well help draw more </span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Called by the grave - you have multiple ways to draw/add and monster effects going off. But stopping it all together is great. Cause stuff you didn't think about like navigation <span class=""hiddenGrammarError"">can be</span> ash.</span>  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Forbidden chalice - effect <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">veiler</span> better sibling. You can't active during the opponent turn unless it's set. But I prefer this over effect <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">veiler</span> because it can only be activated it during the opponent main phase, while Chalice <span class=""hiddenGrammarError"">can be</span> </span>activated when ever  Super poly - amazing board wiper so long as the targets match  <span class=""mceItemHidden""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"">Serect</span> of dark magic - it's a great card to get one of the 2 dark magician fusion</span>  Dark magical circle - I only run 2 cause you don't need 3. It's a good card but sucks when you can't add off it. And I have using circle to add circle.  <span class=""mceItemHidden"">Magicians navigation - It helps get DM and <span class=""hiddenSpellError"">DMG</span> out there. But it's really meant for its dank graveyard effect. </span>  Eternal soul - it has been my favorite dark magician card for the fact that it makes DM immune to all card effects. And the graveyard revive.  Skill drain - no reason to not run it. Some problematic cards have ridiculous effects. So this helps a lot.  Magicians Combinations - The second brick of the deck. It's here so I can negate cards, and to switch back a forward between the Magicians. Also has a cool effect if it get a popped.  Solemn Judgment - the king of saying NO. But be careful to pay attention to life points"

You get to your end by mainly using the 2 Slimes and using their effects to summon Genghis and have some way to get Lamia ither on the field or in the graveyard, which can then go into one of the level 7 Synchros and continue your combos from there. Thanks to Gilgamesh being released in DUOV the deck has a much easier time for a mid combo setup of scales at the cost of being locked into D/D/D's for the remainder of the turn, that is why sometimes you will be unable to go into a Halqifibrax.  One of the deck's biggest weaknesses is disruption, be it an Ash, Veiler or Lock Bird, which is why Called by the Grave is an absolute necessity, without it the deck can play through a single disruption max before you're forced to scoop. Nibiru is your worst nightmare also and recovering from being hit with that rock can be damn near impossible.  The side deck is for when your opponent forces you to go second as well as having a Riser dragon in there if you feel that he is more useful than the Formula Synchron, though it is recommended that you test both out before hand and replace his spot in the side with anything else you might find useful. Ash is also there because I couldn't think of any other card for the side so feel free to replace it as you see fit.  The deck has a quite high skill ceiling and memorizing combos and playing around certain cards can be daunting but feels very rewarding when you finally think of a way to establish a strong board, even if it did take you about 30 minutes into the match to think of it. On a side note the deck can do quite poorly in time as your continuous spells constantly drain your life points therefore I would suggest finding a way to negate it or get rid of it before your standby phase comes up.  &nbsp;"

The link below is the duel between Marcel ( Yubel Possessed) Vs Jaden in season 3 of Yugioh Gx. The duel shows basically why the sacred beast cards belong to her and why i built the deck the way it is. Yubels full 40 card deck when using her sacred beast anime deck wasn't shown, so i took elements from Yubel's Anime Themed Plant deck and the new sacred beasts support cards to help fill the deck out.

HIGH CHANCE FOR OTKs. EASY TO SUMMON HERO BOSS MONSTERS.,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU GO SECOND TO GET THAT OTK.  You need to have Stratos and/or Faris on your opening hand. If you don't have neither, search it out with Emergency call or Reinforcement of the army. It's better if you have solid soldier in your hand so once you have stratos on your hand, you get to summon both.  If you have Faris, special summon it then use its effect to put Increase on your spell/trap zone. Then use Increase's effect to put Faris in the GY to summon Vyon. Once you have Vyon, put either Shadow Mist or Malicious in the GY (based on which effect you need more). If you have Malicious in your grave, summon him back to the field, then link summon Cross Crusader. Activate Cross Crusader's effect to summon back Malicious to the field and back to GY in order to search out a hero to your hand. If you dont have aduster gold yet, search him out using this effect. Activate Aduster Gold's effect to get dark calling. You can activate Vyon's effect to banish a monster from the GY (use Faris) to get polymerization. Before fusion summoning, link summon Decimator using your monsters on the field. Then summon malicious bane. If you have monsters left on your hand, (ideally two different attributes) you can summon Sunrise using polymerization. Activate Sunrise's effect to get miracle fusion. You should have at least 3 strong monsters with at least 3000+ ATK by now  OTK your opponent   The side deck contains the omni heroes so you can use super polymerization and add those heroes to your extra deck based on your opponent's monster attribute.  &nbsp;"

Not looking to reinvent the wheel here. I'm trying The Shining as a Miracle Fusion target when you loop it with Wonder Driver, a convenient LIGHT monster. I usually like decks that are 40 cards, but here I think decreasing the odds of seeing your bricks is good, and more than made up for by all the searching in the deck.  Trying an Isolde Package, with all the equip spells that can easily be put back into the deck before you activate her effect. To compensate for the extra bricks, we're running a full 3 of all the pieces which are now 1 card starters for Isolde. You can't use Cross-Crusader for anything on the turn you Isolde, but you can still essentially do the same thing of searching for a hero monster (via Stratos) while getting extra value in an Honest Neos. It makes Emergency Call and A Hero Lives way better, and improves access to mask change, which is key. So far testing is going well on the reworked Isolde variant.  Updated in advance for April ban list. It's hard to guess what the format will look like between new cards and MR5, so I'm packing a bunch of staples and some stuff for Invoked Shaddoll. Losing Malicious 3 sucks, but is probably fair, and I like the added utility Isolde brings to the deck so far."

Basic strategy is aiming to resolve Halqifibrax effect to summon Deskbot 001 and make Auroradon, ss 3 tokens + 001 back from GY, use Auroradon tribute 2 tokens for Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, use Coltwing ss another 2 tokens, synchro summon using 2 tokens + 001 for Karakuri Burei, make plays until you have 2 Karakuri Bureido and 2 lv4 (one tuner and one non tuner), overlay both Bureido for True King of All Calamities, and synchro summon both lv4 for Borreload Savage Dragon.  Follow up play we can use Accesscode Talker since we have unused Auroradon link3 on field and bunch of different attribute link in GY (can be Almiraj, Halqifibrax, Auroradon, etc.). The Dragun lineup is just precaution if we run out of plays. The tuner engine used works with both the brick Karakuri tuners because they both can go into Almiraj and we can summon Crusadia Arboria to its link point. The handtraps are just good tuners and we can use them as Crossout Designator fodder to ensure our Halqifibrax resolving.  Pros: Super consistent, bunch of handtraps, end board can choose between negation or removal, still has follow up play, and can OTK even going second.  Cons: drawing doubles either the Mecha Phantom Beast or Karakuris will make this combo totally offline, super poly and other power cards are still threats."

Its hard to get everything you want to have on your end board but if develop a feeling for this deck you will soon get lots of fun with spamming your opponent to the surrender.

And one of its effects is that if a monster gets summoned to a zone Cross-Sheep points to while you control a Fusion, you can revive a Level 4 or lower monster. I named this deck after both Five Nights At Freddy's, and Sora Perse, the character in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V who has a Fluffal deck.  This is the reason why I made this Fluffal deck. Cross-Sheep's effect can either help you Link Summon other monsters, or help you do other Fusion Summons. And given how often Fluffals OTK, this deck isn't going to need Borrelsword Dragon (I miss muh baby...), which is why I settled for Borreload instead.   Plus, there's the obvious fact that Cross-sheep's artwork fits in with the ""stuffed animal"" theme of Fluffals. Cross-Sheep is a great addition to Fluffals, both aesthetically and functionally."

Before Jewel Beast - Argosaurus was revealed, I tried to make this before, but it was too inconsistent. But now that Argosaurus helps make Miscellaneosaurus more powerful and makes you less reliant on Souleating Oviraptor, I can afford to make this. It's just your typical Dinosaur deck, except it runs Foolish Burial Goods and Survival's End.  &nbsp;  Because of the artwork of Survival's End, I decided to name this deck ""Ice Ice Baby"", after the song by Vanilla Ice. Your goal is to turbo out Souleating Oviraptor and Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. And Survival's End's graveyard effect makes this easier, since you can use it to destroy Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon (or your opponent's Juraegg Token, if you control Lost World) to summon Oviraptor."

Now with bonus turn 1 board building, a still incredibly fragile combo game, and even more salt from people who","Hello everyone, Tranquilis here. Last year I submitted a decklist for pure Fur Hires that served me fairly well for the entirety of MR4. With MR5 just around the corner I figured it was time to give it a few updates, and the deck plays better than it ever has. A very low bar for Fur Hires, I know, but this version of the deck aims to swarm the field with a series of various members of the Furry Force to pull off a vast toolbox of effects.  The basic premise of the deck is that Fur Hires come in two shapes, the small monsters and the big monsters.  Once per turn all of the small Fur Hires have an effect to special summon any other Fur Hire monster from your hand, except for duplicates, and have an effect that activates when another Fur Hire, regardless of size, is special summoned to the field.  The big Fur Hires meanwhile are all high enough in level as to not be able to be normal summoned without a tribute, and cannot special summon additional Fur Hires from the hand, but have an effect that activates when they finally hit the board that scales in strength based on the number of Fur Hires you control with different names, and a secondary effect to either negate cards by discarding (Rafale and Wiz) or prevent your opponent from targeting your other monsters with battle or card effects (Dyna and Sagitta, respectively.)  At the absolute bare minimum the idea of the deck is to continuously summon the small Fur Hires with their effect to special summon another from the hand, and then end the proverbial chain of special summons with one of the big Fur Hires to get the best bang for your buck from their effect. Where the strategy gets more interesting than an exceedingly linear beatdown archetype is the things the deck is capable of busting out via the extra deck, namely their archetypal boss monster, Folgo, Justice Fur Hire, and the extreme variety of plays enabled by I:P Masquerena.  Folgo is a link 3 that can be made with any three monsters of different type, has three arrows pointing downward, and cannot be used as link material. His two effects are fairly simple, but open up a lot of possibilities depending on what kind of hand you open. His first effect is to summon a Fur Hire from the deck in defense position, so long as it doesn't share a type with any monster that was used to summon Folgo. The effect sounds restrictive, but as a whole two Fur Hires actually share a type, this in the vast majority of cases simply prevents you from summoning duplicates of whatever you made Folgo with, allowing easy access to either Rafale or Wiz, the two main deck monsters you're aiming to leave on your board, or a deceptive amount of play extension thanks to two factors. Do remember that the small Fur Hire effects activate on the special summon of ANY Fur Hire monster, not just from the hand, meaning Folgo being summoned period can proc these effects when you have no more Fur Hires to summon from the hand, and his easy access to their main deck boss monsters also equates to easy access to any other tool the archetype could suddenly need. So long as you have another Fur Hire in hand, or can proc the effect of Filo to summon a Fur Hire from the GY, you also have easy access to Beat's search, the face-up or face-down card popping of either Recon or Donpa, the discard and draw of Helmer, or the graveyard recovery of Seal. If no other options are left your best bet is to simply summon Rafale, or Wiz if he's already on board, but most times you can get the most mileage out of this simple summon from deck by bringing out one of the smaller Fur Hires.  His second effect has a comparatively much less complex amount of utility, but is still one of the main things that make him an amazing card. Once per turn, when an opponent's card is destroyed <span>which does include destruction they triggered with their own cards, and trust me be ready to watch people immediately trigger this effect of their own volition with zero thought, <span>Rafale can draw you one card. If you have three Fur Hire monsters on board with different names, this turns into drawing three cards. With the right set-ups I've come damn near decking myself out in the past with how much advantage this effect can net you, and it makes up the essence of what the deck tries to accomplish.</span></span>  &nbsp;  The deck's main playmaker for f a n c y set-ups is I:P Masquarena. Your ending board, no matter what effectively, should usually be an attempt at getting Folgo, I:P, and some combination of various main deck Fur Hires leftover. Masquarena can quick-effect perform a link summon on the opponent's turn, using herself and face-up monsters you control as material, and giving the summoned monster battle protection. For most turn 1 set-ups the dirtiest thing you can do is make a very quick and easy battle immune Appolousa, Bow of the Goddess, with three monster effect negations ready to go, possibly even 4 depending on how hard you popped off. Rafale and Wiz can discard a Fur Hire card from hand to negate a monster or spell/trap effect respectively, meaning that on an ideal day you can end up with 4-5 monster effect negates, and a backrow negate so long as you have the materials and requisite cards in hand to discard.  Alternatively, Masquarena has two other main options to quick effect link herself into: Either another copy of Folgo, or Unchained Abomination. By making Folgo you can get your free summon from the deck, and trigger the effects of your leftover Fur Hires on board during the opponent's turn, resulting in potentially quick pops, draws, searches, or surprise attack point boosts.  Unchained Abomination is a bit more of an edgecase, however. If the opponent has nothing really worth negating with Appolousa, a rarity that does periodically happen, Abomination can be worth making for his pseudo-battle protection of popping cards when another card is destroyed, when he gets destroyed by card effects, or simply a pop during the end phase, all to the benefit of triggering Folgo during the opponent's turn. Again, he should never really be the priority to make, but can be worth considering against backrow heavy decks Appolousa can't pester to the fullest.  &nbsp;  Otherwise your extra deck is a suite of various, random, toolboxy extra deck things you just happen to be able to make.  Your instant fusion targets are Millenium-Eyes Restrict for defending against hand traps, and Sea Monster of Theseus for being a free special summon to convert into Folgo that doesn't conflict with the typing of any Fur Hires in your deck, while also opening up a very small synchro engine. Feel free to substitute what you feel works best, just be mindful you are very hard-bound to non archetypal, completely generic 2 material synchros that you just happen to be able to make with the levels of your smaller Fur Hires +5. The Xyz line-up is also fairly open to interpretation, but do be warned that most all of your Fur Hires are also different levels which makes any choices here inherently incredibly inconsistent to make. I have Bagooska for emergency stalling, and Ronin Raccoon because the level 2s of the deck happen to be Beasts, so he just happens to be a powerful pick I can kinda make. Sometimes. not often.  And of all your links, we also run one copy of Borrelsword because...  &nbsp;  I mean it's Borrelsword. He does big number and OTK going second, and the deck can pop him out piss easy to shred boards.  &nbsp;  Otherwise, that's the gist of the deck. I may potentially return to this post to throw up some cherry-picked replays of the deck in action, and look forward to answering any questions about piloting the deck or specific card choices in the comments. Thank you for reading."

All you need to start the fun is a Noble Arms and a way to summon Medraut (Medraut, Merlin, RotA, etc) Summon Medraut, equip him with a Noble Arms, and use his effect to bring out Iyvanne. This will destroy your Noble Arms equip and then reattach said equip to Iyvanne, triggering Iyvanne's effect to summon a token. Use 2 of your monsters (usually the token and whichever other one you like) to summon Isolde. Use Isolde's effect to add a Noble Knight to your hand, then use her effect to send 4 equips to the grave (you want atleast 3 Noble Arms in grave to use with Artorigus (you need to send Clarent if you don't have it in hand) and you can/should probably also send a Cursed Bamboo Sword to add either a Broken Bamboo Sword or a Golden Bamboo Sword to get some draw power) and summon a Noble Knight to board. From here depends on what you have in hand. You could use Bamboo Swords to draw if you have the ability to do so, you could use Pop Up to discard and draw some cards, there are several options but in the end you want at least 2 out of the 3 of these in your hand: Mage Power, Glory of the Noble Knights, Twin Swords of Flashing Light. XYZ summon Artorigus and equip him with 3 Noble Arms equip cards (there are rare cases where you want to equip less if you, for example, opened with Clarent or have 2 Mage Powers in hand, etc) then use use Glory to equip Twin Swords/Mage Power (whichever you don't have in hand), then equip the other to Artorigus. By this point, rather typically, you should have Arorigus with Galatin, Clarent, Noble Arms of Destiny, Twin Swords, and Mage Power. This will allow you to spend 500 LP on Clarent to attack directly this turn, and Twin Swords will allow you to attack twice."

There are 3 main OTK options in the deck, depending on what you draw, and what your opponents board is like.  The first OTK option is- of course- Final Sigma. For the OTK, all you need is Nabla and Multiplication. You can consistently get Nabla out through Cynet Mining or Alembertian(or simply by having him in hand already), and from there you can easily summon Multiplication through Nabla's effect. Alternatively, you could summon Alembertian with Multiplication as material if you have Monster Reborn or Equation in your hand, and simply revive Multiplication once you get Nabla. A simple play for a very strong monster.  The second OTK is the Transcode Talker/Update Jammer combo. This is fairly self-explanatory. Link summon for Jammer, then link summon again for Transcode. Jammer lets Transcode attack twice, and Transcode revives Jammer back to the field for a total of 8100 attack on board. This becomes even stronger if you use Multiplication or Code Radiator when link summoning Transcode. Multiplication can double Transcode's attack, and Radiator can reduce an opponents monsters attack to 0 AND negate its effects until it leaves the field. If Radiator was already on the field, it can do this to two monsters, which is even better.  The third of the main 3 OTK options is Masquerenamax. This play is done by Link summoning Link Disciple and Devotee. Disciple tributes Devotee for a draw(and place 1 on bottom of deck), and Devotee produces two tokens. Then, link summon for Wicckid, and use the final token and another monster to summon I:P(You can then search for a tuner from Wicckid's effect). Then on your opponents turn, link into Avramax, which has protection because of I:P. To achieve an OTK, equip this Avramax with Billionblade. Battling any monster with 1000 attack or more, and discarding Multiplication with Billionblade, instantly gives you a minimum of 8000 damage.  You could also potentially OTK with Earth Golem @Ignister by equipping it with Billionblade after summoning it with Super Poly. If it attacks a special summoned monster, it buffs to 4600 at the start of the damage step. Then Billionblade sends Multiplication, which bumps Earth Golem up to 10200 attack, giving you OTK on anything under 2200 attack, which includes Gameciel! This, however, doesn't come up too often, so I don't consider it to be a ""main OTK option"".  Ash Blossom, Ghost Belle, D.D. Crow, Effect Veiler, Pankratops, Impermanence, Reboot and Called by the Grave are self-explanatory. Note that you can discard Mathmech Sigma for Cynet Mining and Twin Twisters, and then special summon it back to the field if you don't occupy an extra monster zone. As of MR5, you can also do this with Super Poly, as long as you don't summon to an extra monster zone. Linkslayer is an extra special summon, and gives backrow removal. Backup Secretary is also an extra special summon. Gameciel is self-explanatory, and can facilitate your OTK if you go for Final Sigma or Avramax.  Light Dragon @Ignister and Red Reboot can swap with Superfactorial and Laplacian to give you extra negate, destruction and recovery. Topologic Bomber Dragon is self-explanatory.  Cyberse Gadget gets you a Disciple &amp; Devotee on its own, meaning you can get Wicckid and I:P with two Cyberse monsters instead of three.  Code Talker Inverted is in the extra deck as it assists the OTK when used with Code Radiator. If you have Nabla, Code Radiator and another Cyberse monster(Sigma, Addition, Subtraction), you can link summon the Code Talker Inverted using the Cyberse monster and Radiator, dropping one opponents' monster to 0 attack and negating their effects.

Ultimaya Tzolkin. Tap into the power of the crims,"I, like many other members of the community, really enjoy the yugioh 5d's anime. Synchro summoning is one of the best mechanics in the game - but it doesn't get the respect it deserves. Many synchro-based archetypes are simply cast away, or just forgotten as a whole. In 2017, a study showed that people would get PTSD flashbacks when exposed to the word 'X-Saber'. Oh god......not again! I already tributed for Gottoms' effect! Despite the injustice given to our white warriors (and dragons), many deck related around the mechanic have been appearing here and there. But you still want something fast-paced, something that can give you an end-board of 8 negates without breaking a sweat. Here I present: Tzolkin HERO.  Making an endboard is pretty easy - but there's no real combo to do so. The way you make Tzolkin most of the time is with Malicious and Coral Dragon. Getting malicious in grave is really easy - the challenge is summoning Coral Dragon. But don't worry; I promised a consistent deck. All of the hero monsters we run are warriors, so Isolde is definitely the ideal play. Since it pitches equip spells - and the new Magicians' Souls allows us to discard spells - we run a reasonable bamboo engine. It surprisingly works really nicely and lets you draw into more extenders like Synkron Resonator (which you mainly use to create Archfiend Abyss the second time you use Ultimaya's effect. Back on topic however - you can send four equip spells to the grave and get an Armageddon Knight + two free cards. Armageddon will send Destrudo and our not-so-new Crystron Halqifibrax (released recently for the TCG) will be put forward. With all the ways to summon in this deck, you simply use Plaguespreader and a level 4 and KABLAM! Your ultimaya. You obviously want to set a card and get that sweet Crystal Wing - but it doesn't end there. Draco-Equiste is a tech that drives this deck to top tier level. Not only can you summon it with your Coral Dragon and a warrior - it allows you to use Ultimaya a second time, as it copies its effect. Here I'd recommend having a void ogre or beelze in order to make abyss, but if you have no cards in hand Void Ogre is still great. And the cherry on top of this concoction of ours - Apollousa. You can use Needlefiber + the other monsters in your grave like Plaguespreader and Malicious in order to get those free negates.  So what do you do if you unfortunately don't draw Miracle Synchro Fusion? Well - keeping Ultimaya on the field isnt bad. Scrap-Iron Signal is a card that just got released, and optimises the build anyway. Its another negate in trap form - but the catch is that it sets itself, so you can activate Tzolkin on your opponents turn for <em>another </em>negate. You should play no more than two copies, because it does clog your deck and there are high chances of you getting what you need anyway with all the draw power in the deck.  In conclusion: this deck deserves a 7.9/10. It's quite old but manages to get the job done. If you think through your plays - you could end on some dope boards. The only downside; side-decking and bricks. Going Second against a deck like Shaddoll (with Winda absolutely killing the purpose) makes it hard for you to do something. Not only that - but you're not guaranteed to open well every game. While yes the ratios are somewhat in favour of good pulls, it still has a too high chance of bricking to be competitive. Its still a fun deck though, and I'll definitely try it out more. You should too."

When that happens, target an opponent's monster to make their ATK 0. If Absolute Zero is destroyed, special summon Gashadokuro from the GY for a 3300 ATK beat-stick that's unaffected by card effects. Use Yuki-Musume to send cards like Mezuki, Necroworld, and Doomking to the GY. Speaking of which...</span>  <span>Second strategy: Use Necroworld for a direct activation for Zombie World.

Guaranteed 100% opponent rage. (Under 100$),"The deck is very easy to use, gives a lot of fun and is very strong.  If you do not draw the mystic mine in the first round, you should choose this card through Metaverse, Left Arm Offering or Demise of The Land. The priority is to activate Mystic Mine, Field Barrier and set Dark Bribe. Then activate Cauldron of Old Man or Wave Motion Cannon. Then win.  <strong>Remember to summon cards when the opponent has more monsters on his field.</strong>  If the opponent is blocked and can't do anything, you can start to heal. If you have 2x Cauldron of the Old man in the field, you heal for 5000 life after 5 turns, after 6 turns you heal for 6000 life, etc. My record is accumulated 75,000 life points but the opponent almost didn't kill me because we played 30 minutes and the deck is annoying. :P  A good option is to activate Prohibition and remove Ash, MST, etc. from the game or cards that can remove Mystic Mine from field.  This deck cost under 100$."

After its release in december 2019 I changed a few things, for example I put in the new unchained monsters. You can find the original idea <strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygorganization.com/unchainedscrap/"">HERE</a></strong>  The strategy guide came to me in the right moment: I was thinking about what could I do with the Unchained archetype, also one the older archetypes I really loved to play is Scrap. I didn't waste to much time, got myself the cards I was missing and gave it a try.  With the release of Scrap Factory back in 2014 I started playing the (pure) Scrap deck, because they got some nice floating (and good looking ultimate synchros). With the beginning of the Arc-V era until the release of the Unchained archetype I couldn't think of a way how to build a competitive deck around Scrap. Not only because Scrap Wyvern wasn't released until early december 2019 in the TCG.  The Unchained archetype itself is more of a control based deck. The Link-2 Unchained Soul of Rage is perfect for interrupting your enemie during their turn, to get yourself some nice big Link monsters.  Both of these archetypes are going pretty well together and if you stay cool you'll be able to have some pretty nice duels.  &nbsp;"

And thus, this hellspawn was born.  As a general rule, you want to go first and turbo out Tarotrei as fast as possible, and then abuse her effects to repeatedly summon/activate the effects of Pot of the Forbidden, Coinorma and Arsenal Summoner. Arsenal Summoner in particular is extremely helpful in building a bigger board, and if you can't get Pot onto the field somehow, you want to activate this guy's effect and search an Eatos or a Grarl. Just keep in mind both Eatos and Grarl are basically vanilla beaters with a nice summoning condition, so don't rely on them or anything; they're more so there to close up the game faster and make BLS."
