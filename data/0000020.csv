With a Brilliant Fusion in your hand and a Ritual Sanctuary on your field, you can Accel Synchro with ease - even Limitover Accel Synchro under the right conditions.  I'm keen on any kind of criticism.  Not gonna tell you my personal combos with this one, but if you ask me for something in particular I <em>could </em>explain it tho. c:  It's been my personal deck for a while now, and so I decided to make it public. Have fun with it, this is probably its final version."

Strategy itself is a classic. Mill your powerhouse level 8 dragons using your wide variety of methods and abuse your ease of access to the graveyard by quickly reviving them. Use Tachyon Transmigration, Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy and Cyber Dragon Infinity to negate attempts to stop your engine, and OTK your opponent as quickly as possible.  <strong>Card Tips &amp; Combos:</strong> <ul>  	<li><em>Heliosphere Dragon</em> is a minor strategy in of itself. Not only is it a target for Galaxy Soldier, it's also a stall card to sit on while you're waiting for combo pieces. Once you've found one, you can Rank 4 into <em>Galaxy Stealth Dragon</em> using another Heliosphere Dragon or Dragon Knight of Creation, and start pumping out even more dragons from your hand. Alternatively, it can also make itself a level 8 when another level 8 dragon is on the field, which opens up your Rank 8 plays. <em>Dragon Shield</em> can make Heliosphere indestructible even if your opponent surpasses five cards in their hand.</li>  	<li><em>Dragon Knight of Creation</em> is fairly versatile, by giving field presence, milling dragons upon destroying a monster, and reviving any dragon by sending itself and a card from your hand to the graveyard. It can be swapped out for <em>Denko Sekka</em> or <em>Ghost Orge &amp; Snow Rabbit</em> (also both Galaxy Soldier targets) if you're facing back-row or effect-heavy decks.</li>  	<li><em>Dragunity Arma Leyvaten</em> revives <em>Arkbrave Dragon</em> by attaching him as an equip spell from the grave. Once you overlay Leyvaten for a Rank 8 play, Arkbrave is recycled into the grave again to revive another dragon next turn. It can be swapped out for <em>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon </em>for even more swarm plays, or <em>Amorphage Goliath </em>if you're fighting other Extra Deck reliant builds.</li>  	<li><em>Draconnection </em>can be a good little combo with Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon or Galaxy Stealth Dragon, by letting you pick and choose which level 8 dragon you want to SS from your hand, by trading for something else from your deck. If you have Dragon Ravine or Galaxy Soldier in your hand as well, it can be used in a pinch if you really need to get a Lord Felgrand or Amorphage Goliath into the graveyard, but not the Photon Dragon or Arma Leyvaten sitting in your hand.</li>  	<li><em>Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One</em> is an instant <em>Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</em>, which goes into<em> Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</em>, if you draw it for a draw phase. If not? No big deal, just ditch it as cost for Dragon Ravine.</li>  	<li>People underestimate <em>Galaxy Queen's Light</em>. Instant Rank 8 play with one dragon and any other monster(s) is extremely helpful in a pinch.</li>  	<li><em>Quickdraw Synchron</em> synchros with Galaxy Soldier to go into <em>Ultimaya Tzolkein</em>, which SS's powerhouses like <em>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</em> and <em>Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</em> just by setting a spell card before using it. Links nerfed this Extra Deck spam strategy a bit, but it's side decked in case you're not playing link format, or can find a way to make it work in link format.</li> </ul> <strong>Note about Link Format:</strong>  This isn't formatted for links but it can be with minimal edits. Because half our Extra Deck XYZ summons into one another (ergo only requiring our one Extra Monster Zone), if you strategize what you're going to need and use, you won't even need a Link Monster to spam more than one Xyz monster at a time in every duel. Infinity or Titanic Galaxy for negation, Full Armor for popping then goes into Dark Matter for milling, Galaxy Stealth Dragon or <em>Queen Dragon Djinn</em> for swarming and protection, the Cipher Dragons for more shenanigans, and <em>Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld</em> or <em>Starliege Paladynamo</em> for additional effects."

Search with Kozmo Tincan which goes great with the new Monster Reborn Reborn from Flames of Destruction  Kozmotown is the most broken field spell in the game. Its a free magical mallet for Kozmo cards in your hand allowing you to reveal any number of Kozmo cards and shuffle them back in the deck and drawing the exact same amount you shuffled in. It also allows you to bring back banished Kozmo cards for the bargain price of 100 LP x the level of the monster and finally when its destroyed it can replace itself or allow you to add any ""kozmo"" card from your deck to your hand  Kozmojo is broken its a non targeting card that for the cost of one your Kozmo Monsters you banish 1 card your opponent controls or from their GY.  Kozmo Dark Destroyer is  your boss monster when that thing is summoned you can target one monster your opponent controls and destroy it also it can not be targeted by card effects and lastly when it bites the dust you can float into a lower level Kozmo from your deck!  Lots of monster recovery with 3 call of the haunteds and monster reborn reborn.  I have full force virus in there at the moment as a test since i run 2 DOG fighter which generate tokens with 2000 atk and 2400 def it pair nicely if it makes it to your next standby phase and if it goes you can SS a level 5 or lower Kozmo from your deck.  Kozmo FarmGirl is another good card it there if it inflicts battle damage to your opponent pay 500 LP to add a Kozmo card to your had this has potential to OTK with the right hand  <strong>TL;DR the lower level kozmos are banished to summon the ships and most of the ships cant be targeted and when they go they summon pilots.</strong>  Try out this deck if you have the cards its kinda pricey but its definitely a fun deck to play when chilling with some friends. I didn't explain what everything does but its pretty easy to play once you're familiar with what the stuff does."

The entire purpose of this deck is to OTK your opponent. The main cards your going to be using are Power Bond and Machine Duplication. If you brick (which is rare) you can use cards like Foolish Burial to send cards like Cyber Dragon Core or Cyber Dragon Herz to the grave to help you get going. Cyber Dragon Core banishes itself to special a Cyber Dragon card. But Herz adds a  card to your hand. Also I run a Kaiju engine so you can get rid of things like Cyber Dragon Infinity, or any monster that Cyber Dragons can not run over. Your main card your going to use for the OTK is Rampage Dragon. Basically have 2 Cyber Dragon cards in your hand, use power bond, then use Rampage's effect to attack three times.  Thanks for Downloading the Deck!"

This deck will put a smile on your face and infuriate your friends. It certainly makes mine angry...","This is mostly a zombie deck, and is built as such. However, the three trump cards in this deck are Pyramid Turtle, Despair from the Dark, and White-Horned Dragon. White-Horned Dragon is obviously the stand-out of this group, as he is not a zombie card.  If you can get Pyramid Turtle early in the duel, lay him face-down in defense mode. Wait for the enemy to destroy him, then activate his card effect and special summon Ryu Kokki. Ryu Kokki's attack is 2400, which is devastating most of the time, and destructive in early game.  Alternatively, If you have Zombie monsters on the field whose levels add up to 3 or 7, you could instead use Pyramid Turtle to summon Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries, which is a Tuner monster. You can then utilize Ghost Reaper and any other Zombies you have to Synchro Summon one of the Shuranui cards.  Another great monster is Despair from the Dark. As an 8 star, he'll probably stay in your hand for a while. If your opponent activates a card that would destroy him, he'll get sent to the field instead. With his 2800 attack, this is a deadly surprise.  White-Horned Dragon is a great monster for late-game. His effect gives the ability to raise his attack up to 3700 (which is difficult to rival). Mix this with Malevolent Nuzzler and Mountain, and he has an utterly destructive 4600. And all for one monster sacrifice.  If, at any point, you're dissatisfied with your hand, or you feel your opponent's planning something, simply activate Disturbance Strategy. This will refresh both of your hands.  A few more cards I definitely want to note:  Spirit Reaper cannot be destroyed in battle. It's incredibly useful in that regard for tributing, especially for White-Horned Dragon.  Mix Spirit Reaper with Patrician of Darkness, and you can make it so that none of your opponent's attacks do anything to you.  Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower can also be comboed with Spirit Reaper, as attacks can't kill Spirit Reaper, and as long as Spirit Reaper remains alive, attacks can't target Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower. This is a combo useful for preparing to summon Despair from the Dark.  WightPrincess is a great card for weakening your enemy. Since it only affects monsters <em>currently</em> on the field, you can discard her, then summon, then destroy the enemy's monster. Alternatively, you could use White-Horned Dragon's low level to your advantage. Since most monsters that can combat him are 8 star, they'd have to have more than a 600-point attack lead to defeat him.  Save Trap Hole and Raigeki Break if you get them early. Wait until your opponent thinks they have their trump card, then destroy it. After that, use Monster Reborn to claim their trump card as your own.  &nbsp;  There are many more strategies with this deck, and I'll admit it's not perfect (I threw it together with cards I own), but I enjoy it. Have fun!"

Today, I think a strong deck is a deck which can cut your enemy combo, not can summon high ATK monster, and the best stragedy I think is send enemy monster to GY without active they effect  With 5 Kaiju monster and 2 Lava Golem, you can easy send they monster to GY and no one can stop you to do this.  And you can use Relinquished to steal that Kaiju.  Main boss is Milenium Eye and Relinquished, when they steal enemy monster, almost enemy monster you steal has  effect negative when they in field or send to GY(because they in spell zone and they send to GY, not destroy) , and Milenium (and Illustionist hand-trap) is QUICK EFFECT, that mean hard to stop him. If you play well and with some lucky, you can easy to cut combo of enemy and kill so many strong monster.  Some combo I can see:  MAIN COMBO:  alway FIRST use kaiju to replace enemy monster because many deck need some type of monster to active a trap or hand-trap  Relinquished+Faceless mage(in GY)+Illustionist make your Boss near immortal.  Illustionest-Millenium can negative 2 effect monster. Notice use Illutionest first because enemy can negative you with solem or Rabbit.  Dark Renewall =&gt;replace relinquished with Faceless mage , because it is hard to send faceless mage to GY to make combo( because also hard for draw him or summon him with LV5, normal way is tribute him with ritual spell) and destroy a enemy monster. Or you can summon a relinquished from you GY and destroy faceless mage with that trap.If you lucky, you can have 2 relinquished. Many combo with that spell.  SUB-COMBO:( I put on side deck)  So I add 2 Instant fusion, you can summon a thousand eye retrick, steal one enemy monster, then at end turn thousandeye will die  will die and send that monster he steal to GY. but I dont think this is such a main combo because very easy to counter it.  Moon mirror to kill some monster that cannot target by effect.  Breakthrought skill or Lost wind to negative enemy effect but NOT destroy it, because relinquished and Kaiju need monster to active effect. I like BS than lostwind.  So Phantom of chao is such a mention choice.  So this is not a link-XYZ or Syntro deck, uhm, you can not summon many monster in one turn to play that ways, and that not neccessary. So I put linkuriboh, and LANpholinkus is you play Tag with friend.  And the last thing I want to say: THIS IS NOT A META DECK BUT NOT A FUNNY DECK, so many combo you can use with it and can make enemy very hard to control the battle, but you dont think to use it in tourament. And  you can change any card you like if you thing that card make deck stronger or just because you want to use them. Good luck  and have fun.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck is very explosive with floodgates and all sorts of spicy techs and tricks. The goal is to use Altergeist Multifaker to summon itself after a trap of yours has been used and special summon Altergeist Silquitous for an extra interruption. Also, making Altergeist Hexstia really hurts your opponent because then you can negate a spell or trap card. Anti-Spell Fragrance is very powerful in this format so using two or even bumping it up to three is essential. Cherries targets are also included in the extra deck for side decking. Use the Scapegoat tokens to make Borreload Dragon to get over boss monsters or use the tokens to make an unbreakable board with the new Knightmare cards!"

Going-second geared,"The goal of this is to practically shut down the game or beat up the opponent quickly depending on what happens early on.Note that the extra deck is a  work-in-progress and the side deck is not actually a side deck but just cards that I have thought about using/was using before. <h4>Ideal Scenario Strategy</h4> <strong>Ideally</strong>, the opponent sets up a board on turn 1. <ol>  	<li>Then by some means (naturally draw, <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, or <a data-name=""Ahrima, King of Wickedness"">Ahrima, King of Wickedness</a> )  get 2 copies of <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> in hand, get at least one to actually stay on the field (2 cards out of the starting 6).</li>  	<li>Next, tribute an opponent's monster to summon <a data-name=""Duke Shade, King of the Umbra"">Duke Shade, King of the Umbra</a>(card #3).</li>  	<li> Then normal summon Ahrima (card #4),  and use it's effect to tribute Duke and search for the 2000 or more defense-criteria meeting <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a>. Since the tribute for Ahrima went to your grave, you can summon Diabolos right off the search effect.</li>  	<li>At this point, you are left with 2 other cards in hand, with Ahrima and Diabolos on the board, allowing you to attack for potentially 4700 on turn 2. In main phase 2, tribute Ahrima with Diabolos to drain the opponents hand by 1 (of their choice) back to deck. Set whatever traps you have from cards #5 and 6. End the turn, get 3 1k/1k Torment Tokens in defense or watch Lair get hit by <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit</a>. (they can not hit Lair with GO until it actively triggers in the end phase) This potentially will disrupt the opponent enough (especially if you have a virus available) that they either accomplish nothing the next turn, or they spend so many resources to reset the game state that they can not deal with your second Lair on turn #4.</li> </ol> <strong>Most of the time,</strong> you will be missing some piece of this combo, having a set monster on the opponents field which you can not tribute, or they will be able to <a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring</a> Ahrima's search when you did not have Lair or Diabolos in hand. Also, since you are going second, you will be vulnerable to counter traps like <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>.  <strong>Other Notes on the main trick of the deck</strong> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, if you have it, will allow you revive Ahrima after discarding it, and if you have Diabolos in hand or the grave, you can summon it right there by tributing Ahrima to draw rather than search (the latter options requires another monster as tribute). Alternatively, it can be used to grab a monster in the opponent's graveyard to be used as the Diabolos-summoning viable tribute target without costing the once-per-turn lair tribute, which can in turn be used for Diabolos's effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a> also works as a one-card means to summon Diabolos, but will cost you your normal summon (or MR if you somehow have her in the graveyard). She allows you grab traps like the viruses to make the big disruption play. The main issues with her include the telegraphed trap play of course, the fact that the effect is unusable once you are down to 2 normal traps in the deck, and that the one-card-play really denies you the ability to use the effect on your opponent's turn as a uninterruptible monster removal (In this deck Lilith, the viruses, and <a data-name=""Dark Spirit Art-Greed"">Dark Spirit Art-Greed</a> are the only effects that allow you to do that on either turn).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> works as another <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>, but costs you your normal summon. In that case, you would summon Diabolos via Duke tributing Armageddon.</li> </ul> <h4>Plan B: Stall it out</h4> Given the strong presence of traps that are used in part to provide to Lilith with targets, even without the right offensive pieces, we can try to delay the game a bit so that we can get them. Our main stall monster is  <a data-name=""Vijam, the Cubic Seed"">Vijam, the Cubic Seed</a> . It provides a set-able wall that will cost your opponent their monster's effects (and then you can just re-summon it from the spell and trap zone) or will continue to act as a non-battle destroy-able wall until your turn. Again this fits the theme of simply stalling the game out, but since we just set this, we can potentially avoid letting the opponent know what we are actually using until turn #4 (assuming we went second. Furthermore, it works as a target for <a data-name=""Recurring Nightmare"">Recurring Nightmare</a> , which gives a +1 if and only if we have 2 or more monsters with 0 defense in the grave as targets (both Lilith and more importantly Ahrima fit that requirement) . <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost </a>is also used as a stall card that more importantly advances our game state going into our next turn. 4x lvl 1 0/0 Zombie-type, Black Sheep tokens provides ample shielding against non-piercing boards. If they actually survive, we can use them to make <a data-name=""Link Spiders"">Link Spiders</a>, which we can turn around and use to make effect monster requiring links like <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a>. This card is much better if we have <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh </a>available, although that is definitely will not be a budget friendly card until the next starter deck comes out in mid-July 2018. This could be used to make <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> (again not the most cheap card at the moment, will come down assuming it gets reprinted as a tin promo) as well (although more often than not that one comes out from Lair's tokens).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Hole"">Dark Hole</a>/<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki </a>(budget permitting) work(s) as a quick way(s) to clear a board(s), although both have a tendency to be ineffective if we actually have the tribute-engine online.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> is of course the classic answer to attack defense. Can work well in conjunction with Scapeghost to keep it alive in order to flip it up and synchro-summon off it rather than just link-out with tokens.</li> </ul> <h3>Notes on the Other Cards Used</h3> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Malefic Stardust Dragon"">Malefic Stardust Dragon</a>: Theoretically protects Lair of Darkness, but more often than not it is used as a stepping-stool for getting Diabolos out by being a valid tribute for it's summoning effect. Also can be used to make a rank 8 xyz with Diabolos like <a data-name=""Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis"">Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Diabolos, King of the Abyss"">Diabolos, King of the Abyss</a>: The original version of Diabolos is costly to summon at two tributes (with no special summoning potential), but it will always generate valid tributes for darkest's summoning effect (because Lair does not give you tributes for tribute summons, it only gives the opponent tribute for effects). This one will not win a game for you, but it is a way to clinch a win out by selectively managing the opponent's draw phase while under the effects of a virus. Would be a lot better if it was 3k attack and level 8.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Soul Release"">Soul Release</a>: I generally like to include this card because it allows for grave managing offensively (banishing anything the opponent has in the grave that could be a target for something) or defensively (taking out grave-originating effects). Practically mandatory if GGV was used to take out any upside your opponent got out of it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Spirit Art - Greed"">Dark Spirit Art - Greed</a> : Allows for a really dirty way to abuse the viruses. All but GGV gives you hand information, meaning you know whether or not the opponent could even negate it, but with lair active it becomes even more nasty. I started using this instead of <a data-name=""Share the Pain"">Share the Pain</a> since it could be a Lilith target and I started to feel that <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> tended to hurt me more than it helped, given I have no way of interacting with banished cards in this deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a> : This one came out of a project to try to find a way to recycle destroyed lairs, as well as find more normal traps that were actually worth running (namely stuff other than battle traps and other situational traps that are hurt from the telegraphing so much). This ends up working somewhat like trap version of Soul Release, but I can also use it to recycle key cards that I have used up, namely lairs and particularly EEV.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a> Actually have not summoned this even once yet (in general I do not use the extra deck much with this). Mainly have it in there is as a highly situational means to draw possibly two cards off Scapeghost, one from summoning an opponent's monster by Sucker's effect, and then drawing for doing so, and then another from <a data-name=""Formula Syncron"">Formula Synchron</a>. I could then tribute Sucker and the monster I summoned with sucker (by her own effect, not lair) into a Diabolos, darkest or original.</li> </ul> <h4>Diagnostic Manual Mk5</h4> In order of severity. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"">Eradicator Epidemic Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Loss of Spell or Trap Capacities from the field or by drawing.</li>  	<li>Notes: There is a reason this is the only one that is limited. Many decks require spell cards as either ways to draw or search for pieces of their combos, and in other cases killing traps simply clears the way for Diabolos to beat them into submission. Definitely the most common target for Lilith other than the triple bottomless search. Pretty easy to use with how common monsters with 2.5k+ attack are.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Full Force Virus"">Full Force Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Loss of non-defensible (1500 or less) 'cells'. Can not take hold in non-defensive cells (Link monsters)</li>  	<li>Notes: At first I was skeptical of using this card, but given how often Duke ended up sitting on the field (requires a 2k defense tribute like duke), it made for a good inclusion. This one actually manages to get a lot of monsters that people still use given how aggressive the game has become.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Deck Destruction Virus"">Deck Destruction Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Victimizes weak individuals (1500 or less atk), but effective against non-defensive hosts as well.</li>  	<li>Notes: It is almost never an issue to find a target this (once Lair is up), but it really misses a lot of targets now. There are decks that use basically no monsters whatsoever that would be hit by this (Evilswarm, a deck where I used this as well, being one of them if the build does not run Evilswarm Obliviwisp). The one thing it can do well is of course is hit a bunch of weaker link monsters.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Grinning Grace Virus"">Grinning Grace Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Targets newborns (newly drawn monsters).</li>  	<li>Notes: This one requires a 2000+ attack tribute (maxing out at 3000), to actually get the desired effect, but always forces the selective loss of monsters from the opponent's hand or deck for every 500 atk of the tributed monster. Thankfully it does prevent the use of the destroyed cards for the turn of their loss, which will actually hurt deck like burning abyss where the effects are on the transfer to the grave and not selectively triggered after-the-fact (but many of those cards already had restrictions on using their grave effects the same turn), but it allows for easy grave-loading. Currently this runs 0 in the main deck as it seemed to be accomplishing little, plus it does nothing for the field situation or the hand.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crush Card Virus"">Crush Card Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Wide-spread controllable outbreaks (kills anything over 1500 attack, but with a lot of penalizes attached)</li>  	<li>Notes: This one got errated hard. It has the deck destruction effect like GGV, but it is optional and basically any deck can find something over 1500 atk that it would like to be in the graveyard. The main thing it does do is wreck the heck out of field, but your opponent is under total LP damage protection for the next 2 turns, so you flat out can not win the game until they have had a chance to respond. Basically the only reason to run this at this point is for <a data-name=""The Fang of Critias"">The Fang of Critias</a> into <a data-name=""Doom Virus Dragon"">Doom Virus Dragon</a> play, but there is no good way to get the Fang in a timely manner. <h1 class=""page-header__title""></h1> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The Spirit Monster Amano is an excellent way to stop hand traps since he will stay on the field after you end your turn. Baroness will give you 2 tokens, very usefull with Pacifics and Spiral Battle and Spiral Power on your hand. Spiral token can be used to tributo ritual both shinobird ritual monsters, as Phantasm Spiral Dragon can be sent to the Gy by Advencd Ritual spell card.  Other solution to keep your side safe is to use Perfomapal Trump Witch's pendulum effect and Fusion summon your Normal Monster to bring First of the Dragons Fusion Monster to the field.  As you can see, this deck is based to have at last one monster to stop your opponet to make a direct attack, or perform a otk.
