The main idea of this deck is use Shinobird Baroness to swap 3 spell/trap on the opponent's field and bring Amano to your side of the field. The Spirit Monster Amano is an excellent way to stop hand traps since he will stay on the field after you end your turn. Baroness will give you 2 tokens, very usefull with Pacifics and Spiral Battle and Spiral Power on your hand. Spiral token can be used to tributo ritual both shinobird ritual monsters, as Phantasm Spiral Dragon can be sent to the Gy by Advencd Ritual spell card.  Other solution to keep your side safe is to use Perfomapal Trump Witch's pendulum effect and Fusion summon your Normal Monster to bring First of the Dragons Fusion Monster to the field.  As you can see, this deck is based to have at last one monster to stop your opponet to make a direct attack, or perform a otk.

Going-second geared,"The goal of this is to practically shut down the game or beat up the opponent quickly depending on what happens early on.Note that the extra deck is a  work-in-progress and the side deck is not actually a side deck but just cards that I have thought about using/was using before. <h4>Ideal Scenario Strategy</h4> <strong>Ideally</strong>, the opponent sets up a board on turn 1. <ol>  	<li>Then by some means (naturally draw, <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>, or <a data-name=""Ahrima, King of Wickedness"">Ahrima, King of Wickedness</a> )  get 2 copies of <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> in hand, get at least one to actually stay on the field (2 cards out of the starting 6).</li>  	<li>Next, tribute an opponent's monster to summon <a data-name=""Duke Shade, King of the Umbra"">Duke Shade, King of the Umbra</a>(card #3).</li>  	<li> Then normal summon Ahrima (card #4),  and use it's effect to tribute Duke and search for the 2000 or more defense-criteria meeting <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a>. Since the tribute for Ahrima went to your grave, you can summon Diabolos right off the search effect.</li>  	<li>At this point, you are left with 2 other cards in hand, with Ahrima and Diabolos on the board, allowing you to attack for potentially 4700 on turn 2. In main phase 2, tribute Ahrima with Diabolos to drain the opponents hand by 1 (of their choice) back to deck. Set whatever traps you have from cards #5 and 6. End the turn, get 3 1k/1k Torment Tokens in defense or watch Lair get hit by <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit</a>. (they can not hit Lair with GO until it actively triggers in the end phase) This potentially will disrupt the opponent enough (especially if you have a virus available) that they either accomplish nothing the next turn, or they spend so many resources to reset the game state that they can not deal with your second Lair on turn #4.</li> </ol> <strong>Most of the time,</strong> you will be missing some piece of this combo, having a set monster on the opponents field which you can not tribute, or they will be able to <a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring</a> Ahrima's search when you did not have Lair or Diabolos in hand. Also, since you are going second, you will be vulnerable to counter traps like <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>.  <strong>Other Notes on the main trick of the deck</strong> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, if you have it, will allow you revive Ahrima after discarding it, and if you have Diabolos in hand or the grave, you can summon it right there by tributing Ahrima to draw rather than search (the latter options requires another monster as tribute). Alternatively, it can be used to grab a monster in the opponent's graveyard to be used as the Diabolos-summoning viable tribute target without costing the once-per-turn lair tribute, which can in turn be used for Diabolos's effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a> also works as a one-card means to summon Diabolos, but will cost you your normal summon (or MR if you somehow have her in the graveyard). She allows you grab traps like the viruses to make the big disruption play. The main issues with her include the telegraphed trap play of course, the fact that the effect is unusable once you are down to 2 normal traps in the deck, and that the one-card-play really denies you the ability to use the effect on your opponent's turn as a uninterruptible monster removal (In this deck Lilith, the viruses, and <a data-name=""Dark Spirit Art-Greed"">Dark Spirit Art-Greed</a> are the only effects that allow you to do that on either turn).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a> works as another <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>, but costs you your normal summon. In that case, you would summon Diabolos via Duke tributing Armageddon.</li> </ul> <h4>Plan B: Stall it out</h4> Given the strong presence of traps that are used in part to provide to Lilith with targets, even without the right offensive pieces, we can try to delay the game a bit so that we can get them. Our main stall monster is  <a data-name=""Vijam, the Cubic Seed"">Vijam, the Cubic Seed</a> . It provides a set-able wall that will cost your opponent their monster's effects (and then you can just re-summon it from the spell and trap zone) or will continue to act as a non-battle destroy-able wall until your turn. Again this fits the theme of simply stalling the game out, but since we just set this, we can potentially avoid letting the opponent know what we are actually using until turn #4 (assuming we went second. Furthermore, it works as a target for <a data-name=""Recurring Nightmare"">Recurring Nightmare</a> , which gives a +1 if and only if we have 2 or more monsters with 0 defense in the grave as targets (both Lilith and more importantly Ahrima fit that requirement) . <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost </a>is also used as a stall card that more importantly advances our game state going into our next turn. 4x lvl 1 0/0 Zombie-type, Black Sheep tokens provides ample shielding against non-piercing boards. If they actually survive, we can use them to make <a data-name=""Link Spiders"">Link Spiders</a>, which we can turn around and use to make effect monster requiring links like <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a>. This card is much better if we have <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh </a>available, although that is definitely will not be a budget friendly card until the next starter deck comes out in mid-July 2018. This could be used to make <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> (again not the most cheap card at the moment, will come down assuming it gets reprinted as a tin promo) as well (although more often than not that one comes out from Lair's tokens).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Hole"">Dark Hole</a>/<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki </a>(budget permitting) work(s) as a quick way(s) to clear a board(s), although both have a tendency to be ineffective if we actually have the tribute-engine online.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> is of course the classic answer to attack defense. Can work well in conjunction with Scapeghost to keep it alive in order to flip it up and synchro-summon off it rather than just link-out with tokens.</li> </ul> <h3>Notes on the Other Cards Used</h3> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Malefic Stardust Dragon"">Malefic Stardust Dragon</a>: Theoretically protects Lair of Darkness, but more often than not it is used as a stepping-stool for getting Diabolos out by being a valid tribute for it's summoning effect. Also can be used to make a rank 8 xyz with Diabolos like <a data-name=""Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis"">Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Diabolos, King of the Abyss"">Diabolos, King of the Abyss</a>: The original version of Diabolos is costly to summon at two tributes (with no special summoning potential), but it will always generate valid tributes for darkest's summoning effect (because Lair does not give you tributes for tribute summons, it only gives the opponent tribute for effects). This one will not win a game for you, but it is a way to clinch a win out by selectively managing the opponent's draw phase while under the effects of a virus. Would be a lot better if it was 3k attack and level 8.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Soul Release"">Soul Release</a>: I generally like to include this card because it allows for grave managing offensively (banishing anything the opponent has in the grave that could be a target for something) or defensively (taking out grave-originating effects). Practically mandatory if GGV was used to take out any upside your opponent got out of it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Spirit Art - Greed"">Dark Spirit Art - Greed</a> : Allows for a really dirty way to abuse the viruses. All but GGV gives you hand information, meaning you know whether or not the opponent could even negate it, but with lair active it becomes even more nasty. I started using this instead of <a data-name=""Share the Pain"">Share the Pain</a> since it could be a Lilith target and I started to feel that <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> tended to hurt me more than it helped, given I have no way of interacting with banished cards in this deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a> : This one came out of a project to try to find a way to recycle destroyed lairs, as well as find more normal traps that were actually worth running (namely stuff other than battle traps and other situational traps that are hurt from the telegraphing so much). This ends up working somewhat like trap version of Soul Release, but I can also use it to recycle key cards that I have used up, namely lairs and particularly EEV.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a> Actually have not summoned this even once yet (in general I do not use the extra deck much with this). Mainly have it in there is as a highly situational means to draw possibly two cards off Scapeghost, one from summoning an opponent's monster by Sucker's effect, and then drawing for doing so, and then another from <a data-name=""Formula Syncron"">Formula Synchron</a>. I could then tribute Sucker and the monster I summoned with sucker (by her own effect, not lair) into a Diabolos, darkest or original.</li> </ul> <h4>Diagnostic Manual Mk5</h4> In order of severity. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"">Eradicator Epidemic Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Loss of Spell or Trap Capacities from the field or by drawing.</li>  	<li>Notes: There is a reason this is the only one that is limited. Many decks require spell cards as either ways to draw or search for pieces of their combos, and in other cases killing traps simply clears the way for Diabolos to beat them into submission. Definitely the most common target for Lilith other than the triple bottomless search. Pretty easy to use with how common monsters with 2.5k+ attack are.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Full Force Virus"">Full Force Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Loss of non-defensible (1500 or less) 'cells'. Can not take hold in non-defensive cells (Link monsters)</li>  	<li>Notes: At first I was skeptical of using this card, but given how often Duke ended up sitting on the field (requires a 2k defense tribute like duke), it made for a good inclusion. This one actually manages to get a lot of monsters that people still use given how aggressive the game has become.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Deck Destruction Virus"">Deck Destruction Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Victimizes weak individuals (1500 or less atk), but effective against non-defensive hosts as well.</li>  	<li>Notes: It is almost never an issue to find a target this (once Lair is up), but it really misses a lot of targets now. There are decks that use basically no monsters whatsoever that would be hit by this (Evilswarm, a deck where I used this as well, being one of them if the build does not run Evilswarm Obliviwisp). The one thing it can do well is of course is hit a bunch of weaker link monsters.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Grinning Grace Virus"">Grinning Grace Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Targets newborns (newly drawn monsters).</li>  	<li>Notes: This one requires a 2000+ attack tribute (maxing out at 3000), to actually get the desired effect, but always forces the selective loss of monsters from the opponent's hand or deck for every 500 atk of the tributed monster. Thankfully it does prevent the use of the destroyed cards for the turn of their loss, which will actually hurt deck like burning abyss where the effects are on the transfer to the grave and not selectively triggered after-the-fact (but many of those cards already had restrictions on using their grave effects the same turn), but it allows for easy grave-loading. Currently this runs 0 in the main deck as it seemed to be accomplishing little, plus it does nothing for the field situation or the hand.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Crush Card Virus"">Crush Card Virus</a> <ul>  	<li>Symptoms: Wide-spread controllable outbreaks (kills anything over 1500 attack, but with a lot of penalizes attached)</li>  	<li>Notes: This one got errated hard. It has the deck destruction effect like GGV, but it is optional and basically any deck can find something over 1500 atk that it would like to be in the graveyard. The main thing it does do is wreck the heck out of field, but your opponent is under total LP damage protection for the next 2 turns, so you flat out can not win the game until they have had a chance to respond.

This deck is very explosive with floodgates and all sorts of spicy techs and tricks. The goal is to use Altergeist Multifaker to summon itself after a trap of yours has been used and special summon Altergeist Silquitous for an extra interruption. Also, making Altergeist Hexstia really hurts your opponent because then you can negate a spell or trap card. Anti-Spell Fragrance is very powerful in this format so using two or even bumping it up to three is essential. Cherries targets are also included in the extra deck for side decking. Use the Scapegoat tokens to make Borreload Dragon to get over boss monsters or use the tokens to make an unbreakable board with the new Knightmare cards!"

Today, I think a strong deck is a deck which can cut your enemy combo, not can summon high ATK monster, and the best stragedy I think is send enemy monster to GY without active they effect  With 5 Kaiju monster and 2 Lava Golem, you can easy send they monster to GY and no one can stop you to do this.  And you can use Relinquished to steal that Kaiju.  Main boss is Milenium Eye and Relinquished, when they steal enemy monster, almost enemy monster you steal has  effect negative when they in field or send to GY(because they in spell zone and they send to GY, not destroy) , and Milenium (and Illustionist hand-trap) is QUICK EFFECT, that mean hard to stop him. If you play well and with some lucky, you can easy to cut combo of enemy and kill so many strong monster.  Some combo I can see:  MAIN COMBO:  alway FIRST use kaiju to replace enemy monster because many deck need some type of monster to active a trap or hand-trap  Relinquished+Faceless mage(in GY)+Illustionist make your Boss near immortal.  Illustionest-Millenium can negative 2 effect monster. Notice use Illutionest first because enemy can negative you with solem or Rabbit.  Dark Renewall =&gt;replace relinquished with Faceless mage , because it is hard to send faceless mage to GY to make combo( because also hard for draw him or summon him with LV5, normal way is tribute him with ritual spell) and destroy a enemy monster. Or you can summon a relinquished from you GY and destroy faceless mage with that trap.If you lucky, you can have 2 relinquished. Many combo with that spell.  SUB-COMBO:( I put on side deck)  So I add 2 Instant fusion, you can summon a thousand eye retrick, steal one enemy monster, then at end turn thousandeye will die  will die and send that monster he steal to GY. but I dont think this is such a main combo because very easy to counter it.  Moon mirror to kill some monster that cannot target by effect.  Breakthrought skill or Lost wind to negative enemy effect but NOT destroy it, because relinquished and Kaiju need monster to active effect. I like BS than lostwind.  So Phantom of chao is such a mention choice.  So this is not a link-XYZ or Syntro deck, uhm, you can not summon many monster in one turn to play that ways, and that not neccessary. So I put linkuriboh, and LANpholinkus is you play Tag with friend.  And the last thing I want to say: THIS IS NOT A META DECK BUT NOT A FUNNY DECK, so many combo you can use with it and can make enemy very hard to control the battle, but you dont think to use it in tourament. And  you can change any card you like if you thing that card make deck stronger or just because you want to use them. Good luck  and have fun.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck will put a smile on your face and infuriate your friends. It certainly makes mine angry...","This is mostly a zombie deck, and is built as such. However, the three trump cards in this deck are Pyramid Turtle, Despair from the Dark, and White-Horned Dragon. White-Horned Dragon is obviously the stand-out of this group, as he is not a zombie card.  If you can get Pyramid Turtle early in the duel, lay him face-down in defense mode. Wait for the enemy to destroy him, then activate his card effect and special summon Ryu Kokki. Ryu Kokki's attack is 2400, which is devastating most of the time, and destructive in early game.  Alternatively, If you have Zombie monsters on the field whose levels add up to 3 or 7, you could instead use Pyramid Turtle to summon Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries, which is a Tuner monster. You can then utilize Ghost Reaper and any other Zombies you have to Synchro Summon one of the Shuranui cards.  Another great monster is Despair from the Dark. As an 8 star, he'll probably stay in your hand for a while. If your opponent activates a card that would destroy him, he'll get sent to the field instead. With his 2800 attack, this is a deadly surprise.  White-Horned Dragon is a great monster for late-game. His effect gives the ability to raise his attack up to 3700 (which is difficult to rival). Mix this with Malevolent Nuzzler and Mountain, and he has an utterly destructive 4600. And all for one monster sacrifice.  If, at any point, you're dissatisfied with your hand, or you feel your opponent's planning something, simply activate Disturbance Strategy. This will refresh both of your hands.  A few more cards I definitely want to note:  Spirit Reaper cannot be destroyed in battle. It's incredibly useful in that regard for tributing, especially for White-Horned Dragon.  Mix Spirit Reaper with Patrician of Darkness, and you can make it so that none of your opponent's attacks do anything to you.  Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower can also be comboed with Spirit Reaper, as attacks can't kill Spirit Reaper, and as long as Spirit Reaper remains alive, attacks can't target Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower. This is a combo useful for preparing to summon Despair from the Dark.  WightPrincess is a great card for weakening your enemy. Since it only affects monsters <em>currently</em> on the field, you can discard her, then summon, then destroy the enemy's monster. Alternatively, you could use White-Horned Dragon's low level to your advantage. Since most monsters that can combat him are 8 star, they'd have to have more than a 600-point attack lead to defeat him.  Save Trap Hole and Raigeki Break if you get them early. Wait until your opponent thinks they have their trump card, then destroy it. After that, use Monster Reborn to claim their trump card as your own.  &nbsp;  There are many more strategies with this deck, and I'll admit it's not perfect (I threw it together with cards I own), but I enjoy it. Have fun!"

The entire purpose of this deck is to OTK your opponent. The main cards your going to be using are Power Bond and Machine Duplication. If you brick (which is rare) you can use cards like Foolish Burial to send cards like Cyber Dragon Core or Cyber Dragon Herz to the grave to help you get going. Cyber Dragon Core banishes itself to special a Cyber Dragon card. But Herz adds a  card to your hand. Also I run a Kaiju engine so you can get rid of things like Cyber Dragon Infinity, or any monster that Cyber Dragons can not run over. Your main card your going to use for the OTK is Rampage Dragon. Basically have 2 Cyber Dragon cards in your hand, use power bond, then use Rampage's effect to attack three times.  Thanks for Downloading the Deck!"

ElementSaber Lapauila Mana's effect to make himself and all your other ElementSabers immune to what you choose them to be immune to is really powerful.

Search with Kozmo Tincan which goes great with the new Monster Reborn Reborn from Flames of Destruction  Kozmotown is the most broken field spell in the game. Its a free magical mallet for Kozmo cards in your hand allowing you to reveal any number of Kozmo cards and shuffle them back in the deck and drawing the exact same amount you shuffled in. It also allows you to bring back banished Kozmo cards for the bargain price of 100 LP x the level of the monster and finally when its destroyed it can replace itself or allow you to add any ""kozmo"" card from your deck to your hand  Kozmojo is broken its a non targeting card that for the cost of one your Kozmo Monsters you banish 1 card your opponent controls or from their GY.  Kozmo Dark Destroyer is  your boss monster when that thing is summoned you can target one monster your opponent controls and destroy it also it can not be targeted by card effects and lastly when it bites the dust you can float into a lower level Kozmo from your deck!  Lots of monster recovery with 3 call of the haunteds and monster reborn reborn.  I have full force virus in there at the moment as a test since i run 2 DOG fighter which generate tokens with 2000 atk and 2400 def it pair nicely if it makes it to your next standby phase and if it goes you can SS a level 5 or lower Kozmo from your deck.  Kozmo FarmGirl is another good card it there if it inflicts battle damage to your opponent pay 500 LP to add a Kozmo card to your had this has potential to OTK with the right hand  <strong>TL;DR the lower level kozmos are banished to summon the ships and most of the ships cant be targeted and when they go they summon pilots.</strong>  Try out this deck if you have the cards its kinda pricey but its definitely a fun deck to play when chilling with some friends. I didn't explain what everything does but its pretty easy to play once you're familiar with what the stuff does."

Strategy itself is a classic. Mill your powerhouse level 8 dragons using your wide variety of methods and abuse your ease of access to the graveyard by quickly reviving them. Use Tachyon Transmigration, Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy and Cyber Dragon Infinity to negate attempts to stop your engine, and OTK your opponent as quickly as possible.  <strong>Card Tips &amp; Combos:</strong> <ul>  	<li><em>Heliosphere Dragon</em> is a minor strategy in of itself. Not only is it a target for Galaxy Soldier, it's also a stall card to sit on while you're waiting for combo pieces. Once you've found one, you can Rank 4 into <em>Galaxy Stealth Dragon</em> using another Heliosphere Dragon or Dragon Knight of Creation, and start pumping out even more dragons from your hand. Alternatively, it can also make itself a level 8 when another level 8 dragon is on the field, which opens up your Rank 8 plays. <em>Dragon Shield</em> can make Heliosphere indestructible even if your opponent surpasses five cards in their hand.</li>  	<li><em>Dragon Knight of Creation</em> is fairly versatile, by giving field presence, milling dragons upon destroying a monster, and reviving any dragon by sending itself and a card from your hand to the graveyard. It can be swapped out for <em>Denko Sekka</em> or <em>Ghost Orge &amp; Snow Rabbit</em> (also both Galaxy Soldier targets) if you're facing back-row or effect-heavy decks.</li>  	<li><em>Dragunity Arma Leyvaten</em> revives <em>Arkbrave Dragon</em> by attaching him as an equip spell from the grave. Once you overlay Leyvaten for a Rank 8 play, Arkbrave is recycled into the grave again to revive another dragon next turn. It can be swapped out for <em>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon </em>for even more swarm plays, or <em>Amorphage Goliath </em>if you're fighting other Extra Deck reliant builds.</li>  	<li><em>Draconnection </em>can be a good little combo with Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon or Galaxy Stealth Dragon, by letting you pick and choose which level 8 dragon you want to SS from your hand, by trading for something else from your deck. If you have Dragon Ravine or Galaxy Soldier in your hand as well, it can be used in a pinch if you really need to get a Lord Felgrand or Amorphage Goliath into the graveyard, but not the Photon Dragon or Arma Leyvaten sitting in your hand.</li>  	<li><em>Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One</em> is an instant <em>Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</em>, which goes into<em> Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</em>, if you draw it for a draw phase. If not? No big deal, just ditch it as cost for Dragon Ravine.</li>  	<li>People underestimate <em>Galaxy Queen's Light</em>. Instant Rank 8 play with one dragon and any other monster(s) is extremely helpful in a pinch.</li>  	<li><em>Quickdraw Synchron</em> synchros with Galaxy Soldier to go into <em>Ultimaya Tzolkein</em>, which SS's powerhouses like <em>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</em> and <em>Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons</em> just by setting a spell card before using it. Links nerfed this Extra Deck spam strategy a bit, but it's side decked in case you're not playing link format, or can find a way to make it work in link format.</li> </ul> <strong>Note about Link Format:</strong>  This isn't formatted for links but it can be with minimal edits. Because half our Extra Deck XYZ summons into one another (ergo only requiring our one Extra Monster Zone), if you strategize what you're going to need and use, you won't even need a Link Monster to spam more than one Xyz monster at a time in every duel. Infinity or Titanic Galaxy for negation, Full Armor for popping then goes into Dark Matter for milling, Galaxy Stealth Dragon or <em>Queen Dragon Djinn</em> for swarming and protection, the Cipher Dragons for more shenanigans, and <em>Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld</em> or <em>Starliege Paladynamo</em> for additional effects."

However my twist on it is to protect your spells / traps with Artifact cards to be able to get easy backup defense/offense cards. If you opponent attempts to disarm your spells / traps they will more than likely trigger your artifacts.  Being able to put on vast pressure with Sky Strikers with some insurance from artifacts is a reliving feeling.  I hope you guys enjoy it as much as i have.  -P.S. Please remember to give me feedback so that i may improve this deck and all future deck builds. :D

Che,"The main strategy for this deck is to summon Secutor to the field (either by the effect of Test Tiger or any other GB monster), and then start swarming the field with his effect at the end of each battle phase. Ideally, you want Secutor remaining on the field indefinitely but even if you’re only able to resolve his effect once: It can put you so far ahead of your opponent that it’s essentially a win-condition by itself.  Another important part of this deck is the Respite engine: Comprising of the card itself, Gladiator Proving Ground and every other card in the deck that has “Gladiator Beast” in its name. They synergize together to make the deck flow easily and consistently, by allowing you to filter through your deck to get to your key cards faster; while also greatly reducing your chances of bricking by allowing you to “reload” your hand if necessary. As with all the other GB cards, Respite can be looped back to your hand via the effect of Equeste, allowing you to re-use Respite multiple times in a single duel.  Secutor’s effect can snowball in numerous way: Whether it’s by going +4 through summoning 2x Equeste and resolving both of their effects; or by using the monsters summoned by him to make the Fusion monster Gyzarus, or the Link monster Dragacius.  I hope you find the video below helpful in understanding the sort of combos you can do with him, along with the rest of the deck:  <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANOY_eC6UGQ</a>  Thank you for reading!"

But thats over now... WE WILL COME FOR YOU! (enjoy and have fun^^","Am not a native speaker so I am sorry for the mistakes that may be in the text.  The strategy is simple, spam Blackwings via Pinaki/Blizzard/Black Whirlwind and synchro summon what your enemy needs... You are able to boost your searching ability(Black Whirlwind) via the Mystic Plasma Zona, every monster now let u search for 500 atk stronger monsters.  Most combs run around Bora and Gale becouse they have no limitation how often u special summon them, like u have Gale, Genex Ally Birdman and Shura in hand, you summon shury, special summon Gale(here you are able to use his effect), take gale back to hand with genex and becouse u have Shura, you special summon him again (and sure use his effect again= -75%atk on 1 monster or 2 Monsters -50% atk). Now u could summon any lvl 7 that not become a tuner, and go then for your Diabolic Dragon.  To have a defensive Monster that helps me to keep the specialsummon running AND be a backup against mirrorforces i put Force Strix in my side.  With Artifact Sanctum i play Artifact Moralltach to play santum in enemy M1, special summon moralltach, destroy a card. Moralltach is a lvl 5 non tuner and can easyly be used to special summon Crystal Wing or a lvl 7 BW synchro. Sometimes the enemy counter Sanctum, what is dumb, becouse u then can destroy a Monster by Sanctum too.  The spell Swallows Nest is a litle special, becouse I can make every lvl 4 BW you have a Zephyros the Elite, what strengths up my combo unbelievable well. With Zephyros Elite I can also make a 5 Turns Swords of Revealing Light, becouse I also can add Swords to my hand to special summon him. ( do it turn 2, makes 2+3=5)  A weapon against early heavy enemys like Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon is Utopia The Lightning I can easyly summon. Against many decks Ally of Justice is very strong, and he makes me able to specialsummon Onimaru the Divine Thunder even when I just have a lvl 7 Tuner BW Synchro monster.  To clear the enemy off and have weapons against his traps a.s.o. I run each once: Icarus Attack, Galaxy Cyclone, Phoenix Wing Wind Blast, Dimensional Prison, Black Sonic, Scrap-Iron Scarecrow and the Artifact Comb i explained befor.  In my side I got 3 Denko Sekko becouse many of my friends love to paly Traptrix and with that card I had at least a good chance."

Incorporates a small Magician engine to take advantage of the 3x Duelist Alliance. Remember to summon Dissolver to fusion summon Vortex Dragon, as this makes him able to be re-summoned later. If not, Absolute Dragon being linked away offers a backdoor way to access him.  If you don't own/don't wish to run Electrumite, here's what I recommend to replace her:  Cut the Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm, the Supreme King Gate Zero, the Dragon Shrines and the Foolish Burials, along with the two Electrumite in the ED. Replace those main deck cards with 2x Pendulum Dragon, 1x Lancer Dragon, 1x Xiangke Magician, 1x Odd-Eyes Fusion, 1x Persona Dragon and 1x Mirage Dragon. The two Electrumites can be replaced with an Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon or Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon (food for OE Fusion) and another link such as Underclock Taker or Space Insulator.

This deck for :for player have some experience in yugioh game, know how  to play link and set co-link monster. this is not easy and not for newpie, but if you know how to play it is so funny and...so META, I mean you can duel with almost other META DECK nowadays, no-one can stop you pro!!!!  Archetype:  -Fable and some other similar monster: all FABLE monster  is have a same type of effect that can active when you discard 1 card to GY, I just put  monsters that can ""special summon when discard another ""fable"" cards/when you discard it from hand. "". I also put some monster such as ""the tricky"" and ""illustion magician"" have a same effect like that. All of them dont have ""can only active once per turn"" that mean you can special summon them unlimitted time and Opponent is very hard to counter you by solem or hand-trap.  -"" use-me-2-time-for-link-summon!!!"" monster: I mean all monster that can auto reborn from GY or summon a token when you send them to there such as Glow-up bull/o-lion/combo frog ""ronin-dupe-swap"", performage clown etc...  LINK-MONSTER:  -now is main monster of the deck, 7 troymare monster, this is so main boss, so you can summon all of them in 1 turn, but a combo of mermail-phoenix-ceberus-gobin is almost immortal.  -need fible is common searcher of the deck, You should summon it first if nothing stop you to summon 1 ""UM2TFLSM"" monster like ""cloak(black-wing tuner)"" or O-lion. Because that monster can re-use 3-4 time in 1 turn.  -firewall dragon: nothing to say with this boss, you should search google how to use it  -And some powerful link monster you can option when use, there is so many way to use that deck.  STRONG POINT OF THIS DECK: all of card is monster, just 1 soul charge ( and 3 pot of desire in option if you want to use), and must be very unlucky guy to bad draw with this deck. Not use spell or trap, very hard to stop it  WEAKNESS OF THIS DECK: some card like mornach field that can stop you to summon anymonster from extra deck, if you must battle a deck like that, oh, nothing you can do. And some  deck that can negative effect of monster like ""skill drain"", but dont worry, I put 2 link-4 monster with 3k ATK, you can easy to summon them with this deck( because the ""fable"" effect active when they in hand, not in field)  NOW I MUST SAY AGAIN: this deck is not for newpie and if you is a newpie and want to use it, you should know that you can lose many time before you know how to play well with this deck."

The biggest issues I've run into while trying to use Coelecanth are the reliance on normal summons and a lack of good search tools.  Brilliant Fusion into Seraphinite and Baobaboon with Dragonic Diagram are there to remedy these problems while also providing a possible win condition with Metaltron XII.  If this deck works properly, it can deal well over 8000 points of damage in one turn.  The current list is a bit bricky atm but I will continue to tweak it.  I will also add a side deck once I am happy with the main deck.  I know this deck looks messy, but I swear there was a reason for each card at some point.  If people would like a more detailed explanation of the strategy and card choices, just let me know.  I am also open to suggestions for card changes, make sure to indicate which card(s) would be removed for any new additions."

It performed extremely well in testing and I was able to go 6-0 on Ygopro using this deck. I had to edit the ratios so much over the course of the past two weeks and this is the final product! Also my last Altergeist build messed up and the file can't be downloaded for whatever reason so sorry about that. The goal of this deck is to go first and set traps and then use them next turn to trigger <a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a> and blow up the field with Altergeists and interruptions. I added <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a> to the main deck because it stops the current meta decks completely by having meta Cherry targets in the extra deck like <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> for pendulums, <a data-name=""Spyral Double Helix"">Spyral Double Helix</a> for Spyrals, etc... Also there is <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> in the extra deck. That is a Cherries target for Raidraptors, but it's mainly for the side deck card <a data-name=""Waking The Dragon"">Waking The Dragon</a>. During game two, if your opponent sides properly they will want to destroy your backrow since Altergeists rely on backrow. You can set <a data-name=""Waking The Dragon"">Waking The Dragon</a> and when they destroy it, you can summon <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> and then you win the game because Ultimate Falcon is almost impossible to deal with since it can only be Kaijud or destroyed by battle. One really cool combo going first to help you if you're new to Altergeists is if you draw <a data-name=""Altergeist Meluseek"">Altergeist Meluseek</a> going first and you didn't draw Multifaker, you can normal summon Meluseek and then link into <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and use Meluseek's effect to add Multifaker to your hand!

I'll try to make this as brief as possible.  <strong><em>Dozered:</em></strong> The first possible OTK is This hand. <strong>Manju</strong>, <strong>Ritual</strong>/or/<strong>Demise</strong>, and <strong>Megamorph</strong> and <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. if the opponent is not running Monster Effect counters you can wipe the board with <strong>Demise's</strong> effect Taking 2000LP and more than likely leaving you with less health then your opponent. When you ritual summon if you have <strong>Doom Dozer</strong> in hand send both <strong>Neo Bug</strong> and <strong>Insect Knight</strong> to the graveyard. this allows you to SS <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. Once you've finished this apply <strong>Megamorph</strong> to <strong>Doom Dozer</strong> and <em>BOOM </em>you got an OTK.  <em><strong>Blue Eyes: </strong></em>The second method is to Have <strong>Manju</strong>, <strong>Ritual</strong>/or/<strong>Demise</strong>, <strong>Megamorph</strong>, and <strong>Swing of Memories </strong>the same pattern applies as above however instead of sacrificing Insects you sacrifice <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</strong>. Once you've cleared the board use <strong>Swing of Memories </strong>and bring <strong>Blue eyes </strong>back. then apply <strong>Megamorph </strong>and once again you've got an OTK.  I've played around 50 games with this deck and it has run though its Great games and its bad games. If any players have any suggestions please leave a comment and i will overview it.  Thanks a lot Blason!"

Use the Toad, Kaiju, F.A. Dawn, and Tri-gate Wizard to negate ur opponent","Please read the deck description below as certain combos are quite complicated.  Advices for the Deck  The deck is not fixed. If you want to have a lower chance of brick, you could well take away one Atlantean Marksman and one Atlantean Heavy Infantry and add in Surface or Aqua Spirit. These cards also help control the graveyard to summon Moulinglacia.  The same goes for adding a few cards to prevent ur opponent from disrupting ur combo. Take away Infantry and Marksman (if you think 3 terraforming is too bricky, take away one) and add in Called by the Grave or Twin Twisters or Cosmic Cyclone.  Two Abyss-Scales equip spell cards are also applicable, as it adds extra protection and makes OTK real easy if you equip it to Mermail Abyssmegalo.  Adding one copy of Dupe Frog seems to also work as Toadally Awesome would be able to summon a fixed Attack target next Standby Phase, and the Dupe Frog would be able to search for the last Swap Frog if it was sent from the field to the graveyard, and potentially bring back Toadally Awesome again. But I personally find the card bricky in certain cases and didn't add it.  Remember you can edit the deck according to ur play style.  Combo 1  Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince + Mermail Abyssteus <ol>  	<li>Summon the prince, use effect to throw Atlantean Dragoons into the grave.</li>  	<li>Dragoon search for a Mermail Abyssmegalo and Prince search for another Atlantean Dragoons</li>  	<li>Summon Mermail Abyssteus by throwing away Atlantean Dragoons into the grave</li>  	<li>Atlantean Dragoons search for Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord, Mermail Abyssteus search for Mermail Abyssgunde</li>  	<li>Summon Riplodocus using Prince and Abyssteus</li>  	<li>Summon Abyssmegalo by throwing Abyssgunde and a random water monster into the grave (leave the spot below Riplodocus open)</li>  	<li>Abyssgunde effect revives Abyssteus</li>  	<li>You have 5 water monsters in the grave, so summon Moulinglacia below Riplodocus</li>  	<li>Use Riplodocus effect to change Moulinglacia type to dinosaur</li>  	<li>Summon Summon Sorceress using Riplodocus and Moulinglacia</li>  	<li>Summon Number 42: Galaxy Tomahawk under Summon Sorceress</li>  	<li>Use Tomahawk effect to summon 4 token</li>  	<li>Use 2 token to make Proxy Dragon</li>  	<li>Use Tomahawk and 1 token to make Knightmare Goblin beside the Proxy Dragon</li>  	<li>Activate Goblin effect throw away one card and draw one, and then normal summon a random monster next to Goblin</li>  	<li>Use Goblin and the random monster to summon a Trigate Wizard</li>  	<li>Use Summon Sorceress effect to summon Knightmare Corruptor Iblee (because it's pointing to Proxy Dragon)</li>  	<li>Use Iblee and Summon Sorceress to summon Knightmare Gryphon</li>  	<li>Iblee will be summoned on ur opponent's field</li>  	<li>If you prefer, use Gryphon to bring back any spell cards from the grave</li>  	<li>Remember the last token? Use that to summon Link Spider above the Trigate Wizard</li>  	<li>You must also realise that this combo work best when it's a 3 card combo, to make Proxy Dragon work you must have another monster next to it. So for example if you had a swap frog in ur hand, you could normal summon it using Goblin, it throws Ronintoadin into the grave, link it away, and it gives you an extra Ronintoadin available to summon next to the Proxy Dragon.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Combo 2  Terraforming (or Kyoutou Waterfront) + Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson + any monster you can normal summon with (not Deep Sea Diva or Ronintoadin) <ol>  	<li>Activate Terraforming to search for Kyoutou Waterfront and activate that.</li>  	<li>Normal summon the monster</li>  	<li>summon Destrudo by activating its effect</li>  	<li>Summon Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</li>  	<li>Use Yazi effect to pop one opponent card</li>  	<li>summon Mare Mare</li>  	<li>Mare Mare effect to summon 3 token</li>  	<li>Summon Linkuriboh and Link Spider</li>  	<li>Use the 4 monsters to summon Saryuja Skull Dread</li>  	<li>Skull Dread draws</li>  	<li>Use Waterfront to search for Kaiju</li>  	<li>Skull Dread special summons the Kaiju</li>  	<li>You will find most times in this combo that you will be able to summon other monsters due to Skull Dread's drawing effect. Such as an extra Toadally Awesome if you managed to draw Swap Frog. Dawn Dragster is also possible to summon next turn as Destrudo is in the graveyard.</li> </ol> Combo 3  Swap Frog + any water monster <ol>  	<li>use frog effect to rid of the water monster, summon the frog and throw Ronintoadin into the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Bounce frog back and normal summon it again</li>  	<li>frog effect throw another swap frog into the grave</li>  	<li>use Ronintoadin effect get it back on the field</li>  	<li>Summon Toadally Awesome</li> </ol> Combo 4 (OTK combo)  Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince + (Optional) Mermail Abyssteus or Mermail Abyssmegalo  The one card combo works when you have Prince and 3 other water monsters in hand. If you have another Abyssteus or Abyssmegalo in hand, it would be a lot easier to carry out the combo. <ol>  	<li>summon Prince, use effect to throw Atlantean Dragoons into the grave</li>  	<li>Prince search for another Dragoons, Dragoons search for Abyssmegalo</li>  	<li>Summon Abyssmegalo by throwing Dragoons and another random water monster from hand</li>  	<li>Dragoon search for another Abyssmegalo</li>  	<li>Summon Abyssmegalo by throwing away 2 random water monsters</li>  	<li>Use Abyssmegalo effect to attack twice by tributing Prince</li>  	<li>Prince effect activates and revives Atlantean Dragoons</li>  	<li>now you have 9000 worth of damage, enough to OTK ur opponent</li>  	<li>This combo improves a lot if you have Abyss-Scale equip spell cards in the deck. I didn't include it in this deck as this deck is mainly focused on bringing monsters that can negate ur opponent.

I normally do not upload OCG based decks or decks with OCG cards in them since I live in the USA and want to stick to the current meta game we have in the TCG. I have found this Pure Abyss Actor deck to be fun to play and there are many combos hidden within the deck to be discovered for people who are trying this specific deck for the first time. The combos involve the Abyss Actor cards themselves and the extra deck monsters, especially <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a>. This deck utilizes all of the Abyss Actor monsters and the Abyss Actor spell cards with no other pendulum monsters in the deck since it is Pure Abyss Actors. Making a build that relies on summoning <a data-name=""Heavymetalfoes Electrumite"">Heavymetalfoes Electrumite</a> going first and setting up interruptions could be a good meta deck once the new Abyss Actor cards come out in the TCG. I have found this deck to be most effective going second because you can actually OTK your opponent on that second turn! One cool combo I love in this deck is when you're going second and your opponent has a monster and you have none while you have <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser"">Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser</a> or <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Extras"">Abyss Actor - Extras</a> in your hand. You can summon one, or both of those monsters and then normal summon if you only special summoned one of the two to make Electrumite and send <a data-name=""Abyss Actor - Wild Hope"">Abyss Actor - Wild Hope</a> off Electrumite's effect. Then, you activate a scale and pop it using Electrumite's effect to add Wild Hope back to your hand and draw one. Next, activate Wild Hope in scale and any other Abyss Actor monster for the other scale and use Wild Hope's effect to make the other scale a nine scale. Lastly, pendulum summon four or five monsters and OTK! I love this combo because your opponent just gets OTKd out of nowhere and it's very funny. Hope you enjoy the deck and have fun figuring out all the other fun combos!"

When the Dark Saviors set came out this year, it introduced Vampires, Brandish (Sky Striker Aces), and Skyfang Brigade (Fur Hire). To make things simpler I decided to test out the Mekk-Knight build with the Brandish engine and found out that its actually really consistent in terms of summons. As long as the main field is empty you can spam the brandish spells to get your monsters on the field to special summon the Mekk-knight of your choice and continue the chain. Only problem is whether or not you can get the cards to get that said chain started. If you think this deck is still inconsistent feel free to alter the card list to suit your play-style...  I will give a bit of advice; once you get the sky striker of your choice on field, try to get the link-2 Mekk-Knight Morning Star on field to have a bit of advantage. Outside of that, I hope you enjoy..."

HOWEVER the limits are very high, i have been in duels were both my opponent and I gain 30,000+ life points, and 10,000+ attack points. This is primary because, my deck focus on stealing the power of my enemy, and using it against them. Without the right hand, you may still lose against fast decks like Fluffal or the new link decks, but your win lose streak will be about even, but with more wins. I love playing with this deck, because of how fun the duels can be, so I hope one of you duelers give it a try :D."

The deck works by giving Ryu Okami to your opponent through Summon Sorceress and milling Cyber Dragon Nova to special summon machine fusion monsters from the extra deck. The deck won't work if the opponent's zones in front of the extra monster zones are occupied or if either Summon Sorceress or Ryu Okami get negated.  Having Ryu Okami in your hand is mandatory for the deck to work: destroy Mariamne with Diagram or another Mariamne to search it out.  Second step is to summon Summon Sorceress, which you can do in three ways <ul>  	<li>discard Rosenix or Thystvern to special summon Sulfefnir, destroy it with its effect to summon Citree and use Rosenix's token or Thystvern's search to go into Needlefiber, use its effect to special summon another Citree and go into Sorceress;</li>  	<li>special summon Terrortop and bring out Taketomborg, then summon any Crystron and go directly into Sorceress;</li>  	<li>summon a True King and Al-Lumi'raj to go Needlefiber -&gt; Citree -&gt; Sorceress; Al-Lumi'raj can be brought out by destroying Bahrastos.</li> </ul> Now the combo begins: special summon Ryu Okami to your opponent's field with Sorceress' first effect, then use its second effect to bring out a True King: this way Ryu will start milling your Extra Deck.

First of all, this deck is so much fun to play in my opinion so please enjoy the deck! I have play tested this deck so much from scratch and it has become really good. I was able to beat Trickstar Sky Striker three times in a row with this deck and many other meta and tier two decks. The goal of the deck is to always go second and special summon Kaijus to your opponents field in the same column as their spell/traps are and then special summon Mekk-Knights! <a data-name=""Psi-Blocker"">Psi-Blocker</a> is super helpful too to block off cards your opponent needs to win once you know what deck they are playing. Use <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a> to dominate meta players and make them banish their core pieces. <a data-name=""Waking The Dragon"">Waking The Dragon</a> is really good to side in against decks that like removing your backrow. Once they try to remove it they will be stuck with <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a> on your side of the field and that will win you the game! <a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a> is a spicy tech card I threw in to help counter Trickstars and Chain Burn since they inflict so much damage. One awesome combo I love to do is special summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Blue Sky"">Mekk-Knight Blue Sky</a> and then normal summon Cherries or <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> and synchro into <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>.

Both strats are ideal for going second so you can counteract your opponents opener. <strong>Itaden's </strong>ability to not only negate but reduce opponents atk to 0 is extremely efficient for removing other boss monsters. The <strong>LightShower </strong>opener is if you know you'll be in a long match against stall decks or turtles. <strong>LightFlare </strong>is the King of efficency in this deck uinmatched with a staggering 5000 Atk points and negating enemy effects, combined with <strong>LightShower</strong> they can become a extremely deadly duo.  <em>Note~This deck was a fun design I came up with yesterday so it does have flaws here and there however the performance with a semi-optimal hand gave amazing results.

He is an amazing guy and outstanding friend to have. Even though he couldn't win the entire NAWCQ he was still able to get Top 64 after the banlist killing <a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a>. Jeremy is a professional Pendulum Magician player who has been playing Pendulum Magicians since they first got released in 2014. He has topped many events but his biggest successes are the recent 2017 UDS in Orlando, Florida and the 2018 YCS Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. He got 2nd place at the UDS and 1st place at YCS Atlanta. He has also topped many regionals this past year. All of the events Jeremy has topped have been with Pendulum Magicians. After Jeremy testing different Pendulum Magician builds from scratch, this is the one he came up with before the NAWCQ that got him Top 64. It is very consistent and plays nicely. If you have experience with Pendulum Magicians then this deck should be easy for you to master!  Here is the full deck profile link on YouTube if you wish to go check it out. Please thumbs up the video and support him and his amazing top at the 2018 NAWCQ!  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ2FFLr6KAE</a>"

It never bricks and can go first or second. Going second is better though since this build runs a lot of handtraps for many reasons. The ghost girls are used to stop your opponent from doing pretty much everything, not only are they good handtraps but you can use them as synchro material with the other Burning Abyss monsters so they aren't bricks in your hand your upcoming turn! That is why this build plays three <a data-name=""Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> so that you can send Libic to the graveyard and use his effect to special summon a Burning Abyss monster from your hand and negate its effects. This way you can normal summon a ghost girl and go into <a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> or <a data-name=""Gravity Warrior"">Gravity Warrior</a> which is another cool tech I added in. <a data-name=""Gravity Warrior"">Gravity Warrior</a> is good to use when you're opponent has a lot of monsters on their board and you don't have access to Black Luster Soldier. Since <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> are light monsters, they can be used as material for Black Luster Soldier. Also, Virgil isn't dead! Synchro into <a data-name=""Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss"">Virgil, Rock Star of the Burning Abyss</a> in this build using <a data-name=""Rubic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Rubic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> and the other Burning Abyss monsters. Virgil's shuffle effect is very powerful even in today's meta. After testing I have won games because of Virgil! Enjoy the deck and have fun guys."

Don't want to spend hundred$ on a deck like them? Use this deck to end them all! Laugh in their face as they sit contemplating t,"This deck is based on cards I actually have. Keep that, and the fact that the fanboy in me shows, in mind. For example, there is only one Buster Dragon because they cost +$6 each. Also, there is a majestic dragon in there because I am a fanboy. This deck is able to run relatively well without spending $100.  I personally find it fun to use. Of course, the main idea is to summon the Buster Blader fusion and Buster Dragon so your opponents monsters are all stuck in defense and unable to use effects. There are other options like Dark Paladin, and the Ebon Magicians, which are both easy to summon with this deck. Number 11 is always nice to have and it is very easy to summon in this deck. Just for extra fun there is the Stardust option and Beelze. Great fun to play a Blue-eyes fanboy and do 10,000 plus damage on a Chaos Max stuck in defense. Any feedback is welcome.

There is room to include Called by the Grave &amp; other Floodgates without effecting combo's.  The Deck is built on 3 Combos;  1<strong>. ISOLDE</strong>: Opening up with ""<em>Armageddon Knight</em>"" will let you send ""<em>Destiny Hero - Malicious</em>"" to the GY, allowing you to Special Summon another copy to Link into Isolde. Search and add ""<em>Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</em>"" to your hand OR another ""Armageddon Knight"" if you have ""<em>Allure of Darkness</em>""/ ""<em>Hand Destruction</em>"" in Hand. Use Isolde to send an Equip spell to the GY to special summon ""<em>Destiny Hero - Dark Angel</em>"" &amp; if possible Special Summon another copy of Malicious. You can Link into most LINK - 4 monsters from here or into ""<em>Decode Talker</em>"" &amp; ""<em>Linkuriboh</em>"". Also if you have a copy of One for One in hand you can Link into Saryuja.  2.<strong> SERIAL SPELL</strong>: Opening up with ""<em>Pot of Desires</em>"" &amp; ""<em>Serial Spell</em>"" is almost always a Win. It should draw enough power to get you BLS &amp; Primal Seed first turn, and banish enough to allow you to continue your plays with Primal Seed.  3. <strong>GRINDER GOLEM / ONE DAY OF PEACE</strong>: If you open the duel with these 2 Cards in your hand, you're almost GUARANTEED a FTK with Exodia.  **The best thing about Armageddon Knight &amp; Isolde, is you can use them to thin your deck out prior to playing big draw power cards.**  Enjoy this build.

Prof. Banner will be proud.,"The strategy for this Deck is to remove from play as many cards as you can then either summon Gren, Gandora Giga Rays ,or Golden Homunculus for your advantage. Keep using Golden Sarcophagus to remove Necroface and use its effect.Once Necroface returns to your hand, do not use it unless you are confident to summon it or return your cards back if you do not have the play cards you need.  Pot of Desires also greatly helps in removing as much cards off your deck. The Extra deck structure is optional, it is mostly there to summon Eater of Millions. Freely adjust the Extra Deck for any format to either Link or Non-link. Use Macro Cosmos, Dimensional Fissure and D.D. cards to your advantage both affecting your side and the opponent's side of the field. Soul Release and Fairy Tail - Snow is also useful in removing from play your cards from your graveyard. Caius and Mobius are there to even the field mostly to remove pesky cards.

That this deck doesn't work well right? Well, guess again! The Invoked Engine with Burning Abyss works super well. This deck also has a very low brick rate. After building this deck from scratch, testing, and making many edits I found the ratios that work. I was able to beat many meta decks and many tier two decks. The decks goal is to go second and win in two turns, or otk on the second turn after your opponent used up all their resources their first turn to setup. Another thing to remember when playing this deck is that you need to make Dante so you can mill cards from your deck to graveyard like <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow"">Fairy Tail - Snow</a>. Snow is a big pain to deal with, so stack up your graveyard! This deck gives so many resources to you because while you have the Burning Abyss monsters in your hand or Dante on the field, you also have either a boss monster in your hand like Black Luster Soldier, <a data-name=""Orbital Hydralander"">Orbital Hydralander</a>, or <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker"">Aleister The Invoker</a> which gives you even more boss monsters and resources after your opponent has run out since normally your opponent will only have one or two boss monsters after they've finished their first turn. The deck also mains many handtraps so going second is a breeze and you can make your opponent lose a lot of their resources if you play the handtraps at the correct time. Since the deck runs so many handtraps, plus having your opponents graveyard at your disposal, going into <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>, and <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> is easy. On the other hand, if you are forced to go first by your opponent, making <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a> is very effective at stopping your opponent from doing anything monster effect related turn two. Since many of the decks monsters are dark you shouldn't have a hard time making Caliga going first. There are so many cool tech cards I added in to the deck to make it so great! <a data-name=""Creature Swap"">Creature Swap</a> is a great one that I love using on my opponent, and I prefer this over <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a> because Mind Control can cause your Burning Abyss monsters to blow themselves up while Creature Swap doesn't and still allows you to use their effects after you destroy them via battle or card effect. Another amazing combo I love doing is with <a data-name=""Tour Bus From The Underworld"">Tour Bus From The Underworld</a>. This card is super effective late game because if you mill it and you've used Beatrice already, you can shuffle her back into the extra deck to make her again! I also don't like using <a data-name=""terraforming"">Terraforming</a> and <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> in this deck because after testing I've realized that since Magical Meltdown counts as a spell card, it prevents you from special summoning the Burning Abyss monsters. Lastly, if you don't like <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>, which I do in this deck since you play so many three ofs, you can swap it out with three <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> instead and the deck will still work well. Enjoy and have fun!"

I was able to beat a lot of meta decks with this TKD build. The goal of this deck is to go second and otk them that second turn. This deck hardly ever bricks, in fact every time I've played it I've never had a bad hand. The part of the deck that I noticed it struggles with the most is dealing with backrow so to solve that problem I put a lot of backrow removal in the side deck. <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> is so good in this deck since you want to go second and you can just use Red Reboot on your opponent during your first turn (second turn of the game) so they can't use backrow anymore is so good because then you can just otk them freely without worrying about all their backrow that will stop you. <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> is also super effective against decks that run field spells like ABC, Lair of Darkness, Pure Dinosaurs, etc... One of my awesome spicy techs I put into the deck is <a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a>. If your opponent has any monster that's not dark type and is a problem for you at that moment you can use Catastor to destroy it. I also love playing this deck because going second they get otkd out of nowhere on the second turn and then don't really know what happened, it's funny. Please enjoy the deck and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask!"

This deck is extremely overwhelming going second, so going second is your best bet at winning. I have been able to beat almost all the meta decks using this deck so it is very powerful and can win almost every time. It has has a low brick rate. The goal of the deck is simple, to go second and handtrap your opponent when they are going first and then use their graveyard and/or your handtraps in your hand or grave for Invoked fusion material. You also have the Sky Striker cards at your disposal to draw more cards and use <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a> as fusion material for <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a>. <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> is really great to screw decks that use a field spell and it's also another <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> basically because you want spell cards in your grave to use the second effect of the Sky Striker cards. Some games I've even been able to get <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a> plus two <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>s or an <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> and an <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> depending on how many <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>s I have in hand. This deck is also really good to bait your opponent into wasting their handtraps on the wrong cards e.g. when you have <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker"">Aleister The Invoker</a> in your hand plus <a data-name=""Sky Stiker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Stiker Mobilize - Engage!</a> and use Engage to bait their Ash Blossom and then summon Aleister to search <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>. Enjoy and have fun."

And it's actually kinda meta. I was surprisingly able to beat a tier two deck, <span class=""module__title__link"">Cinderella, and a lot of tier one decks... I was actually able to beat Pure Dinosaurs, ABC Knightmare, and Pure Sky Strikers. The only problem with this deck is that the brick rate is moderate. You can actually draw too many monsters in your starting hand which will then cause you to lose the game. That has always been the problem when you combine multiple archetypes that are somewhat large. This deck is somewhat meta I would say tier 1.5 maybe. But in the worst case, this deck is always super fun to play against your friends as a casual deck. The goal of this deck is to otk your opponent going second or control your opponent with you going first. You pick! You want to simply mill. That is the goal, that way you can trigger cards like <a data-name=""Performage Trick Clown"">Performage Trick Clown</a>, <a data-name=""Revival Golem"">Revival Golem</a></span>, <a data-name=""Wulf, Lightsworn Beast"">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a>, etc... To special summon from the graveyard so you can make a lot of link monsters or go into <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a>, or <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>, or whatever you want to play to make your opponent suffer from your deck being depleted. <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a> kills in this deck. Being able to bait your opponent's handtraps with something like normal summoning <a data-name=""Aleister The Invoker"">Aleister The Invoker</a> and then using Double Evolution Pill to get <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a> is amazing, or the other way around. You can also make <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> going first sometimes. If you have Giant Rex in your hand and you have <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> in your hand is you can normal summon Giant Rex and then us Foolish Burial to send <a data-name=""Glow-Up Blub"">Glow-Up Blub</a> and use Glow-Up Blubs effect to send one card from your deck to grave to special summon himself. Then you can go into Naturia Beast which is basically a win condition going first since he stops all spells plus you'd have UCT. There are other ways to make Naturia Beast first turn like using Double Evolution Pill and using Giant Rex in your hand as material plus another card and get UCT and then special summon Giant Rex then you can normal summon Glow-Up Blub from your hand to get Naturia Beast.

Better going second, but is fine with going first. ","This is an old deck, I'll admit. But I've tried experimenting for zoodiacs to go aggro as quick as possible, and even with a high spell count, it seems to work almost all the time. The main focus is to get either Broarbow with a ton of zoodiacs on him for direct attacks, or Anything else with protection from the mirror forces and their effects. Drident is used more of an end-game sort of card, to clear the field to attack. Overall, I really found this deck to be fun! Only edits, Maybe take out some jar of greeds for raigeki and dark hole, maybe some Xyz agents for an extra finish."

As I learn more and more, I hope to keep the deck constantly updated.  A few combos that could be exploited in this deck: <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> can send  <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> to the GY to draw 2 cards, them revive with <a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a>. Normal Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a> using its effect, allowing for an Xyz Summon. If that Xyz Monster would be destroyed, <a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a> can be banished for a 1-time escape.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> can send <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> to the GY, and once there Special Summons itself, and search out for <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a>. With it on the field, you can Normal Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a> to Special Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> from the GY, for an Xyz Summon.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a> can be activated in order to Special Summon 2 <a data-name=""Photon Token"">Photon Token</a>s, and with them you can Special Summon <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a>. This also leaves you a Normal Summon, and with <a data-name=""Galaxy Knight"">Galaxy Knight</a>, you can Normal Summon it in order to Xyz Summon.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  I'm afraid these are the only combos I could find, but best of luck to anyone that tries out the deck, and let me know what you think of it!"

Updated with the most recent ban list in mind. Capable of OTK. You should win about 90% of your duels with this deck,"Combo 1: When opponent has less then 3 monsters in their main monster zones, activate Just desserts, then chain Ojama Trio to give them 3 Ojama Tokens. Just desserts will then resolve its effect conflicting 1500 damage to your opponent. (Plus 500 x whatever monsters they already have.)  Combo 2: While your opponent has many cards on their field, and you have any combination of Just desserts, Ceasefire, Secret Barrel, or Secret Blast set down on your field, activate them all, and then activate Accumulated Fortunes as the 4th (or higher) chain. You'll do insane Burn damage and draw 2 cards.  Combo 3: Set Absolute King Back Jack face down. When he's (or she... it's 2018 I don't judge) destroyed and sent to the graveyard, activate his effect to change the order of the top 3 cards of your deck. You should pick a normal trap to be on top. Then, banish Absolute King Back Jack to excavate the top card of your deck, and since you already know what you'll get, you should have drawn a normal trap, and since it's a normal trap, you can set it face down on your field as soon as the effect resolves. Choose a different trap depending on the situation."

Focusing on special summoning and hea,"There are a couple of strats in this deck. One of which is getting an Extra Deck dragon onto the field, usually by special summoning materials from the graveyard using cards like Call of the Haunted, Silver's Cry or Soul Charge. This strategy is all about control of the field, with cards like BE Twin Burst Dragon, FHD and Odd Eyes Absolute Dragon. Some of these summoning methods even have ways of summoning multiple ED dragons at once. Take Azure Eyes Silver Dragon, when summoned, you're guaranteed to get a Blue-Eyes White Dragon at the start of your next turn. This can be used to help get Twin Burst Dragon onto the field.  Alternate strategies involve using the two Egyptian Gods, Slifer the Sky Dragon and Obelisk the Tormentor, Slifer isn't a priority in this deck but can come in handy when you've got a big hand and maybe a Soul Charge lying around. The best way to get one of these onto the field is to either special summon from the graveyard, or (If you're lucky), your opponent not destroying your front line.  A simple overview of the deck is that you want your best cards in the graveyard to special summon later. But if you're worried about banishment, don't fret. Imperial Iron Wall will help protect against that. As much as this deck seems to be about pressuring your opponent and dealing a lot of damage, it does have some elements of denial. Whether it's Compulsory Evacuation Device, Enemy Controller or Raigeki, you're sure to foil your opponent's strategy."

Soul Absorption is an amazing choice - 500 free LP every time a card's banished. I've also won games with over 40,000 LP before. Needless to say this deck is filthy, I came second in a tournament recently with it and only lost because of deck-out, so this is good if you want to win. Full Extra Deck but you won't use it except for Eater of Millions - Banish entire extra deck to special summon it.

There is a cool otk combo going second where you summon <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> and then summon Black Luster Soldier under Underclock Taker and then use Underclock's effect to reduce your opponents monster's attack to zero and then inflict seven thousand damage or more if you have Dante on board or another monster!"

You go first, you win. Goukis make crazy boards going first that make your opponent lose instantly because they cannot target, destroy by battle, or destroy by card effects your monsters. The combos to this deck are stupidly good but really hard to master. I will explain how to extra link your opponent... The first step is to make <a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights</a>, then use her second effect to send <a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a> and special summon <a data-name=""Gouki Octostretch"">Gouki Octostretch</a>. Then, from the first effect of Isolde you should have added either <a data-name=""Gouki Bearhug"">Gouki Bearhug</a> or <a data-name=""Gouki Riscorpio"">Gouki Riscorpio</a> and <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">Gouki Headbatt</a> from the Gouki you sent to the graveyard as material for Isolde. Keep in mind you can use <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">M-X-Saber Invoker</a> too to summon Isolde. Then special summon Headbatt by sending Bearhug or Riscorpio and make <a data-name=""Knightmare Goblin"">Knightmare Goblin</a> but do not use Goblin's effect. Search off the <a data-name=""Gouki Octostretch"">Gouki Octostretch</a> that was used to make Goblin to get <a data-name=""Gouki Rematch"">Gouki Rematch</a>. Use Rematch to special summon two Goukis in your grave. <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">Foolish Burial</a> can help if you have it in your hand before you use Rematch that way you can send a Gouki that you haven't used its search effect yet. After that, use Isolde and the two Goukis on the field from Rematch to make <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> to the right of Goblin. Use the effect of Divine Sword in your grave to banish two warrior monsters, preferably not the Goukis and add the Divine Sword to your hand. Then make <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a> using Goblin and put it up on top of Firewall so that they are co-linked and activate Firewall and Mermaids effects, Mermaid as chain link one, Firewall as chain link two. Send Divine Sword as cost for Mermaid and special summon the monster from your hand from Firewall's effect right next to it on the left or right side and then <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a> on the other side of Firewall and draw one card from Mermaid being co-linked. Keep in mind when you are special summoning monsters from your hand off Firewalls effect they need to be Goukis that way you can keep searching Goukis and keep special summoning off Firewalls effect. Next, use Divine Sword again to add it again. Then, use Iblee and the monster from Firewall's effect to link summon the second Goblin to the left of Firewall where the previous Goblin was. Go ahead and use both Firewall and Goblin's effects, doesn't matter what order, and pitch the Divine Sword again. But do not use Iblee's effect in grave! You need Iblee at this point. Special summon another Gouki from your hand to the right of Firewall. Make sure to draw one card since Goblin is co-linked. Then use Firewalls effect to add Octostretch and Iblee from grave back to your hand. Try to keep the Octostretch in your hand as long as possible because you need it for <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> later. Perform your second normal summon with Iblee right next to Goblin and special summon the other Goblin in your grave off Iblee's effect to the left of Iblee. Proceed to link summon <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> using Iblee and the monster to the right of Firewall where the monster to the right of Firewall was. Use Iblee's effect this time to special summon Iblee to your opponent's field. And of course, Firewall's effect triggers *sigh*, special summon another monster from your hand where Iblee was, to the left of Goblin. Then use that monster and Underclock to make <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">Trigate Wizard</a> in between the two Goblins. Of course, Firewall goes off again... Special summon again to the right of Firewall. Use that monster and the Goblin that has its effects negated that was summoned off Iblee to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> to the left of Trigate Wizard. Then use Firewall's effect to special summon but this time, special summon a level one whither its <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> or Octostretch if you were able to keep it in your hand, etc. Go into Linkuriboh on top of Trigate Wizard to extra link your opponent. Finally, that triggers Firewall's effect once more allowing you to use Firewall and the monster you special summoned off Firewall as material to link into <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> to the right of Goblin where Firewall originally was. That's how you extra link your opponent! You can also make <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> going first using <a data-name=""Glow-Up Bulb"">Glow-Up Bulb</a> and <a data-name=""Spyral Super Agent"">Spyral Super Agent</a> or <a data-name=""Gouki Suprex"">Gouki Suprex</a>. Enjoy the tutorial and deck profile!"

""Mound of the Bound Creator"", and  c.) a combination of co-linked ""Knightmare"" monsters, ""Borrel-"" monsters, and ""Firewall Dragon"".  The absolute best hand you can start with, going first, will contain either ""Terraforming"" or ""Mound of the Bound Creator"", an ""Earthbound Immortal"" monster, and ""Scapeghost"". The best Immortals' effects require you to tribute a monster (e.g. Uru's ""Change of Heart"" effect.), so ""Scapeghost"" provides, at most, 3 uses of these effects, as well as fodder to Tribute Summon an Immortal. Alternatively, you can make ""Summon Sorceress"" and a ""Knightmare"" monster, then use the effect of ""Summon Sorceress"" to Special Summon ""Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu"" from your deck. This deck does best going first. If done right, you can often OTK using the effect of ""Borrelsword Dragon"" and the Direct Attacking abilities of your ""Earthbound Immortal"" monsters, as well as the burn effect of ""Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu"". This is the second edit of the deck, which is still in-dev by myself and a few friends."

A standard combo would only require a Rainbow Dragon and Vision HERO Vyon in hand:  1. Normal Summon Vision HERO Vyon 2. Send Elemental HERO Shadow Mist to the grave through Vyon's effect 3. Use Shadow Mist's effect to search for Elemental HERO Neos to add to your hand 4. Activate Vyon's effect to banish Elemental HERO Shadow Mist to add a Polymerization to your hand 5. Use Polymerization to fuse Rainbow Dragon and Elemental HERO Neos into Rainbow Neos 6. Winner winner, chicken dinner  If you can't get to Vyon but have Shadow Mist or Prisma in hand as well as a Mask Change, Masked HERO Koga and Dark Law are good alternatives till you can get to the necessary play makers. Nova Master, The Shining, and Escuardo are also good if you happen to have a Polymerization in hand with Blazeman or Rainbow Dragon in hand. Good luck and have fun!  --  In the advent of the newest banlist, I have made some slight tweaks to the deck to try and boost consistency. If you have any suggestions on improving the deck, please feel free to comment to make my favorite deck the best it can be! Thank you and enjoy!  --  My (possible) final update for my favorite deck to play. With the new Neos support and the access of Super Polymerization as well as Neos Fusion being a one card Rainbow Neos, I feel as though the deck has reached it's final stage. If you have any suggestions on improving the deck, please don't hesitate to let me know!  Enjoy duelists!  --  I was a big silly for thinking I was done lol So I <em>tried</em> to make it so you have a much more variety of plays you could make besides Isolde, Fusion Monster, Pass. Added some more generic links and cut some dead cards like Prisma and Mask Change and the like. I dunno if this is better, I haven't tested it out yet (what a genius I am) but I cut the cards I knew that needed to go. Hope this can be the definitive version of the deck, I love Rainbow Neos so I want to see him do his best. As always, please leave suggestions that could help make this deck the best it can be! Enjoy!  --  I don't know anymore. The new Predaplant Link monster means you are now playing like 7 copies of Neos Fusion. That's crazy. Enjoy!  &nbsp;"

Its pretty straight forward, however it leaves alot of options depending on the opening hand. I dont use a hero lives, its not worth the cost to me. I often use mask change with absolute zero with masked hero acid to clear my opponents side of the field. Forbidden lance is very useful and underrated in my opinion. I always keep at least two copies of twin twisters and discard shadow mist to use its effect and add a bubbleman to my hand.  I never use traditional recipes.

This deck can go first or second. You can go first and make your opponent lose their entire hand by using <a data-name=""Trickstar Reincarnation"">Trickstar Reincarnation</a> and then <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> right after your opponent searches. Or if you have two Trickstar Reincarnations you can use the first one during your opponent's first standby phase then after the first one resolves use the second one and chain it with Droll &amp; Lock Bird, that way they lose their entire hand and cannot play. Or you can go second and use cards like <a data-name=""Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!"">Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!</a> to kill off your opponents monsters. Trickstars fix the whole Sky Striker engine as a whole because you have six extra spell cards at your disposal which are the three <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>s and the three <a data-name=""Trickstar Light Stage"">Trickstar Light Stage</a>s. This way you get spells into your grave faster which will allows you to activate the second effect of all the Sky Striker spell cards. <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> is also super powerful in this deck because it means you get to summon <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> which then means you can loop <a data-name=""Trickstar Lilybell"">Trickstar Lilybell</a> and <a data-name=""Trickstar Lycoris"">Trickstar Lycoris</a> to continuously summon Lilybell off Firewall's special summon effect. Scapegoat is just really powerful in general though since you can go into the Knightmare link monsters and all. Enjoy the deck!"

With Double Iris and Astrograph Sorcerer banned in the last lists, i've been testing a build that can handle a great variety of situations using some of my favorite Extra Deck monsters. This deck uses all Extra Deck summon methods, and reasonably knowing what your opponent's deck does, you choose the appropriate monsters to bring. Here are some examples:</p> <p><strong><em>OFFENSIVE MOVES:</em></strong></p> <p><strong>*Opponent's monster cannot be destroyed by battle</strong>; -&gt; Use <em>Borreload Dragon </em>to steal it or just summon <em>Supreme King Servant Dark Rebellion </em>to cause a lot of damage if the opponent's monster have a great attack. <em>Timebreaker Magician </em>can also banish both itself and your opponent's monster.</p> <p><strong>*Opponent's monster cannot be targeted by your card effects</strong>; -&gt; <em>Borreload Dragon </em>and <em>SKS Dark Rebellion </em>can handle this situation. You can also use <em>SKS Clear Wing </em>to destroy all your opponent's monsters and OTK using all your monsters. <em>SKS Clear Wing </em>also can destroy a monster that battles with him before the damage step and cause effect damage equal the ATK of the destroyed monster.</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's monster cannot be destroyed by your card effects</strong>; -&gt; Again, <em>Borreload </em>and <em>Dark Rebellion </em>helps a lot when you are trying to OTK.</p> <p><em><strong>STUNNING/CONTROL MOVES:</strong></em></p> <p>*<strong>Opponent is using a deck with a great number of LV5 or higher monster effects; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon </em>and <em>Odd-eyes Vortex Dragon </em>to interrupt your opponent's monsters effects. <em>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon </em>is really helpful against <em>Timelords </em>and <em>Blue-eyes,</em> for example. <em>Jackal </em>can also help negating too, but it'll need 2 spell counters (it works for any deck, not specifficaly LV5).</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's deck uses too much special summons to build its board; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Evilswarm Nightmare </em>to stun 2 of your opponent's special summons. Be sure to stun at the weak point of your opponent's combo. You can also use <em>Number 41: Bagooska </em>to stun the game for 3 turns, but be careful with Link monsters, since they can't be changed to defense position.</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's deck uses spells/traps to significantly build its board; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Vortex </em>and <em>Norito </em>to negate your opponent's spells/traps.</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's deck uses card destruction to clear your field and attack you directly with medium/low attack monsters; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons </em>to hold your field, since it cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects (but can be targeted).</p> <p><em><strong>SUPPORT/FIELD BUILD MOVES:</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>Electrumite:</strong> Summon him (2 or 3 times, if possible) to prepare your Pendulum Summon. Be sure to bring 2 level 7 monsters to summon Absolute Dragon.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Odd-eyes Absolute Dragon:</strong> Absolute is the gate to bring Vortex. Use it as a link material to summon Borreload to just bring Vortex after that.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Odd-eyes Meteorburst Dragon: </strong></em><em>Meteorburst is here to summon a monster from your Pendulum Zone and use itself to bring Absolute. It can also stun effects during the battle phase.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Metaltron: </strong></em><em>Metaltron is summoned using 2 Electrumites. Use it to open more zones for the Pendulum Summon and optimize your play bringing more Extra Deck monsters to help you.</em></p>"

Naturia Beast Turbo Sekka's Light 2018 (Going Second) (Post Cybernetic Horizon),"Ready for a ""Dangerous!"" deck? Haha, well here it is. The new Danger! archetype mixed with Burning Abyss plus the Naturia Beast Turbo engine starring <a data-name=""Elephun"">Elephun</a>! This deck did really well in testing and is meant to go second with. You otk your opponent very quickly with monsters like <a data-name=""Danger! Bigfoot!"">Danger! Bigfoot!</a> and Black Luster Soldier. There are other special techs I put in like <a data-name=""Fabled Soulkius"">Fabled Soulkius</a> which allows you to send two cards from your hand to the graveyard to special summon itself and it's a 2200 beater so it's really good. In testing I hardly bricked and the deck is really amazing. The deck also has <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> since the deck is all monsters which allows for more draw power and more otking. If your forced to go first though and you have Rescue Cat in your hand, it's a good idea to summon it and use it's effect to get out Elephun and <a data-name=""Gallis The Star Beast"">Gallis The Star Beast</a> to go into <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> and stop your opponent from playing their spells. Of course just like in my other 60 card Burning Abyss decks I always have that one copy of <a data-name=""Tour Bus From The Underworld"">Tour Bus From The Underworld</a> because it can shuffle back <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a> back into the extra deck allowing you to summon it again. Have fun everyone!"

Zones (for board placement): EM         EM  M    M    M     M    M  ---back row ---  Combo: Requires 1 Gouki + 1 other card that can get you to Isolde, or 2 level 3s 1.) Get to Isolde; you can do this through 2 level 3's --&gt; going into invoker --&gt; summoning suprex --&gt; going into Isolde; or by having a monster that can SS + one gouki.  Board Placement: Isolde --&gt; goes in right extra monster zone  2.) You Link your 1 Gouki + other card/Invoker --&gt; go into Isolde; CL 1 Gouki add of GY eff (add headbatt off of this Gouki's eff), CL 2 Isolde (add that Gouki that just hit the Grave, off isolde).  3.) Dump Phoenix Blade, or Moon Mirror (if you draw Phoenix Blade), and SS octostretch from your Deck. Then activate Headbatt's eff in your hand --&gt; discarding the Gouki you added off isolde and SS Headbatt to the field next to octostretch. Then special summon knightmare cerberus (you do not need phoenix blade in hand at this point) using octostretch + headbatt --&gt; CL 1 Gouki #1, CL 2 Gouki #2 (doesn't matter the order) --&gt; add a Gouki you haven't used this turn (so in this case it can't be headbatt/octostretch/gouki used to get into Isolde) and Gouki rematch.  Board placement: Knightmare Cerberus, since Isolde is in the right monster zone, should be summoned to the Left Downward Zone of Isolde.  4.) Activate rematch, targeting headbatt and octostretch to Summon them to the field. 5.) Special Summon Firewall dragon to the left of Cerberus (its arrows point up to an empty spot and left, the only zone firewall should be going in), using Isolde + Octostretch + Headbatt (<em>remember that octostretch and headbatt were SS from grave by the effect of Gouki Rematch</em>). 6. Now add the phoenix blade to your hand (if it was in your GY) by banishing 2 warriors (Isolde is fine to banish at this point, but <strong>DO NOT</strong> banish octostretch)  Board Placement: In the spot that is left to Cerberus you have summoned Firewall, this zone is right underneath the Leftmost Extra monster zone (you had used the rightmost to SS Isolde).  7. Special Summon Knightmare Mermaid, using Knightmare Cerberus, above firewall dragon in the Leftmost Extra monster zone --&gt; activating Mermaid as CL 1 and Firewall as CL2 (if you mess this up, combo dies). For CL1, discard phoenix blade --&gt; SS Iblee (this Special Summon happens after Firewall's effect resolves), CL2 (Firwall Eff) Special Summon the Gouki you had added when you made Knightmare Cerberus back in Step 3.  Board Placement: Knightmare Mermaid in leftmost extra monster zone, above firewall dragon, with knightmare corruptor iblee &amp; random gouki being on your side of the field.  8. Add back the Phoenix blade to your hand (banish 2 warriors from the GY, <strong>NOT</strong> octostretch) and then Special Summon Knightmare Goblin to the right of firewall (in the middle main monster zone) activating Firewall Dragon as Chain Link 1, the Gouki that hits the GY's eff as Chain Link 2, and Knightmare Goblin as Chain Link 3 (don't use iblee's effect just yet). CL 3 resolves first --&gt; discard phoenix blade, draw 1 (now you can normal summon), CL2 resolves next --&gt; add another Gouki that you have not used this turn (probably riscorpio or bearhug), CL1 resolves --&gt; Special Summon the gouki you just added to the leftmost main monster zone (Left of Firewall Dragon).  9. Up until this point we have not activated Firewall Dragon's bounce effect; now that you have Knightmare Mermaid up top, and Knightmare Goblin to the right of Firewall Dragon - you are going to activate the bounce effect, adding 2 cards to your hand. You will add octostretch and iblee from your GY to your hand.  Board Placement: Leftmost extra monster zone - Knightmare mermaid, underneath Mermaid is Firewall Dragon, to the left of firewall dragon is the gouki you last summoned, and to the right of Firewall Dragon is Knightmare Goblin.  10. With that extra normal summon, you're going to Normal Summon iblee to the only zone Goblin has open (it's rightmost zone, which is directly under the rightmost extra monster zone) --&gt; this triggers Iblee's effect --&gt; allowing you to summon Knightmare Cerberus to the rightmost main monster zone (next to Iblee).  11. Using the Gouki you had summoned off firewall + iblee --&gt; you're going to go into your 2nd Knightmare Cerberus (next to knightmare goblin); using that gouki's effect to add another Gouki card (add one more gouki monster that hasn't been used or isn't the gouki you added off isolde/octostretch), and using Iblee's effect to special summon herself to your opponent's field. Firewall's effect will trigger allowing you to summon 1 card from your hand.  12. Use Firewall's effect to summon octostretch from hand (the one you bounced from the grave) to make linkuriboh above Knightmare Cerberus. At this point you have achieved the extra link, however each card can be desroyed by battle; so you use firewall's effect for the last time to summon the last gouki you added (from your hand) to the field.

The way to do that is to have <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>, <a data-name=""Tour Guide from the Underworld"">Tour Guide from the Underworld</a>, or <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a> in your starting hand. Then after you those via starting hand or <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> then go into <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a> using Fiendish Rhino Warrior and another Burning Abyss monster or any level three monster or using Tour Guide and Graff. Then use Dante's effect to send Graff to grave to mill three and use Graff's effect to special summon <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> from your deck. After that, go into either one of the link two Knightmare's and use Cir's effect to special summon Dante and Dante's effect to add back Cir to your hand, then go into Knightmare Mermaid using the link two Knightmare underneath Dante and send Cir to the graveyard to put Beatrice under Mermaid! Also, going second being able to otk is quite easy because you can go into Dante first or any rank three to get rid of your opponent's monsters, or use <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>, etc... and then use the Danger! cards in your hand like <a data-name=""Danger!

Also, by Special Summoning a Link monster either from the Extra Deck or GY you can activate Cynet Regression to destroy 1 card on the field and also draw 1 card.  You can bring two monsters from the GY when a Cyberse Link monster is destroyed by using both Salvagent Driver's effect and Cynet Recovery's effect. This way you can also bring RAM Clouder and in the next turn you can tribute it to bring Transcode Talker and bring another Cyberse Link-3 or lower with Transcode Talker's effect.  Transcode Talker + Crusadia Equimax = Target protection and Crusadia Equimax with 4800 ATK  Transcode Talker + Excode Talker = Target protection for both, destroy protection for Transcode and Transcode Talker with 3300 ATK.  Transcode Talker + Pentestag = Target protection + Piercing damage  Since this Deck have only Cyberse monsters, you can put Rivalry Warlords if your opponent runs a deck with a lot of different types.

Lair is great because each time your tribute an opponent's monster for an effect, you go +1 in card advantage. Diabolos isn't a major part of this strategy but he's a fine boss monster. Activate a trap to summon Multifaker, special Silquiand bounce. Meluseek + backrow wins games on their own. Marionetter is an okay starting normal summon if you need more traps or just a body on the field. Pot of Duality get you monsters when you have all backrow and backrow when you have a ll monsters, reasoning is good because you have all normal summons in the main deck. Called to the Grave for those pesky ghost girls. Mind Crush to laugh in their face when your opponent searches for something. Enjoy!"

Also, the Danger! engine allows for very easy Galaxy Tomahawk's. You can jump start some serious Gumblar/Knightmare/Firewall plays with it alongside other special summons.

I'M OUT OF MY MEDS.,"Graydle: Suck your opponent's monsters.  Paleozoic: Engine for Toad and disruptions. Also sucking your opponent's cards.  Put two together and you get Grayzoic deck. A mash-up of both worlds. What's interesting is that this deck opens up a lot more options due to the existences of Tuner monsters in form of Slime and Slime JR. This allows a new branch in which Frog Paleozoic, in what I believe lacks: Raw Power and Exchange.  This deck is great for going first, but decent for going seconds. If your opponent doesn't have any cards for negation. You basically ram Graydle Snake, Eagle or Alligator(SEA) into the monsters and take control of them.  Since both Gray's and Paleo's (Banana&amp;Egg diet) effects activated mostly in the graveyard. Skill drain is a very good card to tech in. (TCG note: sorry for the loss. Since Skill Drain is limited in your side, it's not a good card since you can't search it.)  It's best for you to get Mistar Boy, Ophanibia and Toadally in one turn. This formation is very infamous. With Graydle, you had secondary options of pumping out Graydle Dragon and maybe Psy-Framelord Omega for more disruptions.  Anyways, here are some reasons of the number of cards in main deck:  1x Graydle Slime: You only need one. This card is great but with additional one more, you basically take away one slot from your 40-cards deck instead of another Paleozoic cards. Plus, his effects run on graveyard too. So there's Monster Reborn for you.  1x Toadally Awesome: I'm from OCG, and toad is limited. Plus, your deck isn't a Rank 2 spammer. So therefore, IMO, you don't need a second toad in your extra deck.  Eldonia instead of Canadia: Canadia is in the side deck because right now, a lot of monsters have targetting-immune effects. Link monsters can't even be set down. So I opted for boosting 500 ATK for you to ram SEA without getting damaged, a lot.  No Solemn cards: Wishes and Authority are self-explanatory but Strike and Warning are out because you need to conserve your LP for you to ram your SEA into your opponent's monsters. Remember, the highest ATK Graydle monster is only 1500.  PSY-FRAMELORD ZETA AND SHOOTING STAR DRAGON? : I had situations whereby I only had plays for a Level 7 Synchro, so this is an option. Shooting star for making White Aura Biphamet come out faster and easier.  No Needlefibre: <ol>  	<li>Your deck only had 4 tuners.</li>  	<li>You need to save up 1-3 extra Extra Monster Deck Slot for it to work flawlessly.</li>  	<li>Mistar boy is better for this deck.</li> </ol> Salvage instead of Surface: Salvage is better than Surface due to Salvage's tremendous recycling, a discard fodder for Dinomischus and JR'S effect only Proc on normal summoning effect.  Side deck options: <ul>  	<li>+1 Graydle Slime= -1 Gamaciel.</li>  	<li>Canadia to replace with Eldonia if you want to flip down cards.</li>  	<li>Surface to replace with Salvage if you want.</li>  	<li>Black Moonlight to replace with Biphamet. Since you don't have Bihpamet, you can replace Shooting star with Clear Wing.</li> </ul> Now, onto my another Meth trip.Timelord+Trains..."

Someone please send help.</strong>  Madolches are known for their shuffle into de- *<em>Heavy cough*</em>  Naturia Beast.  Just nat beast at this point if we're being real with eachother. While that is still a [<em>highly preferred and reccomended]</em> strategy, the deck has good synergy with the brilliant fusion engine and a few zoodiac cards, along with some sort of link spam mechanic that I pulled out of a dumpster behind the arby's on 4'th avenue.  Now some of you may be asking, <em>""How is this deck good or viable in any way, shape or form?"" ""The absolute hell were you thinking making a deck that doesn't have a sky striker engine like us true 1337 brain bois at table 5?""</em>  The simple answer is that it's not designed for playing in the current meta. Sure, if this sees the competitive side of things, it will need HEAVY adjustments, and still may be lucky to see the higher side of table 500, but most importantly, when not completely dead handing 3 brill fusion and 2 gem-norms, it is functional and will get a combo off uninterrupted, hopefully being unmanageable for the opponent.  As far as combos go, its pretty straightforward. Brilliant fusion is your gamemaker. if you get it off and seraphinite on the field, you've done your first turn correctly. Also you must be playing to the tune of 50 cent's ""Candy Shop"", the Julien Creance Remix on loop for 3 and a half hours beforehand. This is a critical step. Do remember your combo should look as such- <ol>  	<li>Scorpio - discard monster ( thousand blades to skip step four and glow up bulb to make nat beast later. never discard the clown without thou blade.)</li>  	<li>Cobra - Grab brill fusion</li>  	<li>xyz, into mx-sabre invoker</li>  	<li>detach to summon thousand blades OR</li>  	<li>detatch to summon zoodiac from deck (rat/pass)</li>  	<li>Make missus radiant (good dog) with mx+ any earth on your field</li>  	<li>Use the damn brill fusion. (you've earned it)</li>  	<li>Send the clown brigade (trick clown if you sent thousand blades at any point, or juggler if you didnt. banish juggler for hat boye immediately)</li>  	<li>summon a hootcake by any means necessary (destroythechild.wav)</li>  	<li>banish mx for the mailman. (nothing stops the mail)</li>  	<li>grab the house for these homeless cakes. (don't activate until after saryuja)</li>  	<li>make saryuja with missus, clown or hat, thousand blades, and mailman. draw 4, send 3. (in ygo, select radiant last)</li>  	<li>you just did a 12 step combo with a 6 year old deck.</li> </ol> After that do what you need to do. natbeast.exe, knightmare removal, or even add trish to the deck. summon another mailman for madolche ticket and go for the madolche extra deck monsters just to be that much more of a <strong><em>Madouchebag.</em></strong> This deck will have a good few problems with interrupts but just make sure that you bait and space your combos accordingly. you can use the zoodiacsto extend your combos around missus radiant if you need a little bit of time to figure out if that trap is actually a sollemn.  Thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to look at my craft of garbomancy! My next decklist will be cubics and their still obscenely mediocre variant decks.  Remember to throw a cake at someone."

Examples of such cards are El Shaddoll Construct, Premature Buiral or Blackwing - Godu the Vague Shadow.  The deck's main focus is to put enough pressure on the board to have your opponent commit to their Extra Deck, making Shaddoll Fusion's strongest effect (Fusion Summoning from the Deck) live. To get to this point, you need 2 things: cards that put pressure on your opponent and ways to get to your Shaddoll Fusion faster.  To put pressure on your opponent, Subterror monsters are very adequate, since they're big, they're easy to summon, and they have powerful effects. The most common way of summoning your Subterrors is throught Subterror Nemesis Archer and Subterror Nemesis Warrior, so that's the reason why I'm using a Trinity on a 2nd copy of The Hidden City: It not only searches our Subterror Nemesis monsters, but it also helps triggering our Subterror Behemoth Monsters and its also has a pretty decent battle protection effect.  Since July 2018's list, Shaddoll Fusion has been co-limited, so that means that only 1 copy of the card can can be used, decreasing the deck's consistency. In order to circumvent this, and get to Shaddoll Fusion as soon as posible, I decided to use 2 trinities (yes, 10 more cards) to play another 2 copies of Shaddoll Hedgehog. This aslo helps with the late game, since having more Shaddoll monsters on the deck means you can resolve Shaddoll Fusion more times throught the duel.  The second co-limited card I choosed to play was terraforming, since it pairs well in a deck with so much Field Spells, and helped with the consistency of the LIGHT engine chosen to run in the deck. The A-B-C Union monsters: a flexible engine that is good both making Rank 4s and Links, while having a very powerful boss monster that is quite easy to summon.  That, paired with a lot of generic good cards and some FLIP support cards, is my approach on a deck that is currently considered one of the top decks of the format. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/alternate-format-analysis-trinity-introduction/"">If you are interested on the format, you can read an introduction to the format here!</a>"

Anyways, after testing another variant of pure invoked, this is what I have come up with. Everyone thinks the new card that came out in the 2018 mega tins,  <a data-name=""Mudragon of The Swamp"">Mudragon of The Swamp</a> is useless. Well I think wrong! This card is amazing and it's an <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> target that allows you to pick any attribute you want and that then allows you to fuse into any Invoked fusion monster you want! Also <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, is of course just super broken in this deck. Going second is great because you can handtrap your opponent badly and then when it's your turn you can fusion summon and control them. And of course you have <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> to just OTK them easily if they have a bunch of defending monsters on board. This deck literally never bricks, but it can't beat every deck, it can for sure win against most tier 2 decks, but tier 1 can be pretty tough sometimes, but you still have a pretty good chance of winning if you play the deck right. Enjoy!"

Cubics are an <em>awful</em> archetype by nature, and you will not only be dueling your opponent, but also your own deck.  As a die-hard fan of these things since they were even announced, the best advice I can give is that everything you hear about Cubics in those rare conversations where they are even brought up is wrong. Continue at your own risk.  The first thing to know about Cubics is that they need to never be the only thing at work. The only way they can truly succeed is with the assistance of other archetypes. In this guide, I will be showing you why that is and what you will need to do to achieve an <strong>amazingly </strong>consistent Cubic plus other deck.  Let’s look at the important monsters in a painless and brief way.  First up is Duza. An odd bird this one is, as it can fill any role you need it to. Stall, OTK, link material, Xyz spam, or fusion assistance...  He does it all.  In an ironic twist of fate, Duza is arguably the best added support for any archetype outside of a +2-draw card. Sends everything you could need for any situation. Karma for a +1, Unification for a pseudo stall engine or 3 additional link materials, or wave for even more stall potential in the form of mass cubic counters.  Always play him at 3.  Next is Crimson nova. Excellent protection against many, if not all non-link decks that don’t focus on backrow much, as well as ending the game when you’re done with the charade of giving your opponent a fair and fighting chance in the battle phase. Easy to summon and not a once per turn.  Can easily become a 10k hitter with a karma and a wave. Beware of honest players and the 3 people in the world that play magical cylinder.  Vijam is interesting because he serves either zero purpose in the deck one game or saves you from defeat in another. Very risky to play, but if your opponent doesn’t know what you’re playing, and they don’t have much removal, he is excellent to sit on face down to buy you some time.  The beast line is weird because you won’t be playing Garnex or Garoodia, just buster gundil. The reason for this is that their effects are rather weak, and in all honesty, you will not be destroying anything with a 1k or 2k hitter in this day and age, and they take too much to bring out with not much reward.  Now Buster Gundil, that’s a different story.  A 3k beater with 3 attacks is very strong and is only magnified by the access to Karma and Wave. In most cases, when you get him out, its better than Nova. If you are interrupted on your warpath you also have an excellent recovery mechanic that lets you summon 3 Cubics from your grave and add 1 Cubic <u>card</u> to your hand. Run 2 at least.  The Cubic king line is the same song and dance except for a few exceptions-  Guera Guile is the damn mvp for everything ever and is the hidden gem here.  From hand, it’s a Cowboy in the form of 800 increment burns and serves as a quick way to get your unification spam going. It can also serve as a good placeholder to get vijam out from the grave and get a Karma proc on the field in a pinch though battle. Remember, the effect CAN be activated after battle because monsters are destroyed AFTER the damage step.  Don’t run Vulcan Dragni. Just don’t.  Indoria is an odd one. In more ways than one, it is a worse Buster Gundil. Hard summoning will more than likely never be the right choice, since Guera Guile does the same amount of burn with 2 less monsters needing to be sent. You’ll only really use it when you can’t get Buster out with unification for the sent to graveyard effect. Usually only run 1.  And for the elephant in the room, Lets have a quick discussion about Nova Trinity.  At any point you could get him out, you should have won the game already. Let it be a sign that you are probably dragging things out beyond the capabilities of the Cubics themselves. The only real reason you should have him out is that you drew all 3 novas turn 1 and you have some sort of fusion card in hand. At that point, you’ve either won, or <em>lost very hard. </em>  The Spells and Traps  Cubic. Karma. 3.  No. More. Questions.  Cubic Wave is finicky because in certain hands it guarantees you the win, but if you aren’t running pure cubics, it can sometimes ruin an entire hand by not being a critical combo piece, or even drawing multiple when it can’t be used.  Unification of The Cubic Lords is your main engine piece in the graveyard if you plan on doing anything productive with your turns. When a cubic is <strong><em><u>removed from the field by any means</u></em></strong>, you get a special summon from deck (duza). Keep in mind, Xyz’s don’t count towards this, so if you plan on using duza as a material, remember that this will end your chain if you don’t have another cubic on board.  We don’t run cubic rebirth or mandala for the simple reason that by the time either of those would be useful (on the rare occasion) you are already either set up to win, or you messed up your combo so hard you deserve the loss.  Next Up, Tech Cards.  Foolish burial goods is first here because it’s essentially an archetype card. Run 3 and pray to your karmas for salvation in the coming turns.  Dark world dealings is the best compromise for a draw card that doesn’t neg you completely while also getting to have some sort of board / hand advantage. Great bait for ash when you send a karma when you don’t need to. It more often than not reveals what your opponent is playing so you can plan accordingly, and can ruin a lot of starting hands for the enemy.  Paired with a foolish burial goods, Sekka’s Light’s second effect can serve as a desperate way to get out of a sticky situation with a bad starting hand, but most of the time, the downside of drawing it heavily outweighs its upsides. Run 1 if you tend to have bad luck drawing your big guys.  Anyone who runs summoner monk is wrong. Do NOT run this card. It will brick you, and it’s just asking you to waste your normal summon with all these handtraps running around. Dark world dealings is all the discard you will ever need, and is always useful along with being beautifully clutch.  Anything else is up to you. Imperial iron wall is great for mega banish decks after you get your turn off, and the gem knight engine (with the clown brigade with the plant bugs) loves to nestle its way into the deck and give you extra duza and vijam normals.  The typical splash cubic engine should be around 27 to 31 cards-  3 x Nova  3 x Duza  3 x Vijam  2 to 3 x Buster Gundil  1 x Indiora  2 to 3 x Guera Guile  2 to 3 x Cubic Wave  3 x Cubic Karma  3 x Unification  3 x Foolish burial goods  2 to 3 x Dark world Dealings  This gives you space to add in almost any handtrap, counter trap, or other archetype in without issue.  To play them is pretty simple. Go for Duza at all times. If you get ashed, do your best to get a unification or vijam in the grave and get duza off the field with guera guile. Hold nova plays until you can win. The less time nova is on field, the better chance you have to win. There is only one real time nova can be chained off of and that’s the battle phase.  The best archetypes to mix with cubics I have found so far are-  Cubic zoo – use barrage to take out duza popping the uni and getting zoos, along with a brill fusion engine  Invoked Cubics – along with having every attribute besides water when you add the trash boys, gives you a quick way to summon trinity if you have all 3 nova in hand.  Cubic lightsworn – Minerva can be made with duza and Cubics love mill.  Cubic Knighmare – scapegoat and iblee give this deck some extra length into the extra deck  And the best so far is Cubic Timelords – Access to rank 10’s, constant gamestate manipulation, along with something to do with your non-existent backrow. Tribute duza’s for timelords and send time maiden with dark world dealings for some added salt.  Hope that if anyone was looking for a way to play these, I was able to help. Have fun!"

This is a bit of a risky way to play Fur Hires where you sacrifice your first normal summon for Aleister but it works considering that you have 6 ways to revive your Fur Hires back to make their plays.  This deck runs a 2:2:2:2 Invoked ratio (2 Aleister, 2 Invocation, 2 Magical Meltdown, 2 Terraforming) and would require you to sacrifice your normal summon to get Aleister out to search Invocation, fusion summon with Invocation using Aleister on the field and one Fur Hire in your hand (any would do). Aleister banishes himself while the Fur Hire monster goes to the graveyard, though with Invocation's effect you can retrieve the banished Aleister and shuffle Invocation back into the deck. The real beauty lies with reviving the used Fur Hire monster with Mayhem Fur Hire/Monster Reborn/Soul Charge/Back to the Front/Call of the Haunted. Revive the Fur Hire monster, do what you can with your hand and bam you got field control. The best outcome that you could have on the field is a Mechaba, Rafale especially with an Effect Veiler in your hand giving you 3 monster negates all in all."

When you have the ""Double Evoulution Pill"" use the effect to Special Summon ""Ulimate Conductor Tyranno"" from your deck or if not possible any other LVL 7 or higher from your deck. If you also have ""Lost World"" use that as well. <h2>Other strategies:</h2> If you are not able to use the main strategy there are some others you can use for example to play ""Rescue Rabbit"" and Special Summon two Normal Monsters and start linking away or XYZ Summon ""Evolzar Dolkka"". There are some others combinations for example to first play ""Unexpected Dai"" and then do the first efffect of his and then send a monster to the grave and then use his second effect to destroy the normal monster but negate the effect by using ""Lost World´s"" effect and sending one ""Petiteranodon"" from your deck instead of destroying the normal monster and then use ""Petiteranodon´s"" effect to Special Summon ""Super Conductor Tyranno""."

Jerry*db),"So I know that <a data-name=""That Grass Looks Greener"">That Grass Looks Greener</a> is banned currently, but this deck was made before it got banned, when it was at one and boy is this deck fun to play. I just had to post it. One of my best friends Jerry and I built this deck from scratch and we were even able to make it in real life! Big shout out to him for helping to make this deck profile possible and making the deck possible in real life for me. Jerry is a professional eBay Yu-Gi-Oh card seller and has many years of marketing experience. He has over 30,000 good reviews on eBay from his customers and years of selling cards. He has the best deals on Yu-Gi-Oh cards around, beating all other card sellers on eBay. His deals on cards are amazing, especially the more expensive Yu-Gi-Oh cards like Ash Blossom, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>, etc... He gets all the newest sets on or a couple days after it's release date. He also has older cards too. All his cards are always in mint condition and stay that way until it is in your hands. He provides free shipping in the USA and ships very fast, the card(s) get shipped by him personally, within 24 hours or less and arrive to your house very quickly. Please go to his eBay store and support him, trust me you won't regret buying from him! He's also very kind and responds to all his buyers quickly and with respect. His eBay store is Jerry*db. This deck is a causal deck to play and is good going second or first, but going second is probably better since the deck plays <a data-name=""Void Imagination"">Void Imagination</a> and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a>. You might be wondering why the deck plays <a data-name=""Beelze of The Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of The Diabolic Dragons</a>, <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a>, <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>, and <a data-name=""True King Of All Calamities"">True King Of All Calamities</a>. Well the reason is because they can be summoned using <a data-name=""Infernoid Decatron"">Infernoid Decatron</a> and a non-tuner. You can use Decatron's effect to send another Infernoid monster from your deck to your graveyard to make it that monster's level plus one. So to summon Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend for example, if you send <a data-name=""Wulf, Lightsworn Beast"">Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</a> to your graveyard off Grass's effect or another card and special summon him, then you can summon Decatron to send <a data-name=""Infernoid Harmadik"">Infernoid Harmadik</a> to make Decatron level 4 and then synchro into Scarlight. As for Black Rose Dragon, it's the same idea but a little different. Get a level 3 on the field like Infernoid Harmadik, then summon Decatron to send the other Harmadik to the graveyard to get Decatron to level 4. Or you can use <a data-name=""Raiden, Hand of The Lightsworn"">Raiden, Hand of The Lightsworn</a> or <a data-name=""Felis, Lightsworn Archer"">Felis, Lightsworn Archer</a> and another level 3 non-tuner. For True King of All Calamities, you have to use Decatron's effect as well to summon him. You first need <a data-name=""Infernoid Devyaty"">Infernoid Devyaty</a> on the field and then summon Decatron to send <a data-name=""Infernoid Attondel"">Infernoid Attondel</a> to make Decatron level 9 and then go into True King of All Calamities. Again, as for Big Eye it's the same concept, get level 7 Infernoid onto the field and use Decatron to send <a data-name=""Infernoid Sjette"">Infernoid Sjette</a> and yeah. Now as for making Beelze, that is a combo that Jerry came up with which I fell in love with immediately even though it's situational. It involves using <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a> and <a data-name=""Chaos Sorcerer"">Chaos Sorcerer</a> to summon him. Overall, this deck is just so fun to play and it hardly bricks. Have fun and check out my friend Jerry's eBay store for great low prices on mint condition Yu-Gi-Oh cards!  &nbsp;  Link to his eBay Account: <a>https://www.ebay.com/usr/jerry*db?_trksid=p2047675.l2559</a>  Link to his Products: <a>https://www.ebay.com/sch/jerry*db/m.html?_nkw=&amp;_armrs=1&amp;_ipg=&amp;_from=</a>"

To do that, I needed more monsters like <a data-name=""Caius the Mega Monarch"">Caius the Mega Monarch</a> in the recipe, but ones that, unlike Caius, wouldn't blow up in my face in certain situations (such as going first). After searching for a while, I discovered that <a data-name=""Dual Assembwurm"">Dual Assembwurm</a>might be the one for the job, since it had the following benefits:  &nbsp; <ul class=""s570a4-12 lnAcJj"">  	<li class=""s570a4-11 fcAyyj""> <p class=""s570a4-10 iEJDri"">It works great with the Deck's search engine, as it <strong>has Mega Monarch Stats</strong>.</p> </li>  	<li class=""s570a4-11 fcAyyj""> <p class=""s570a4-10 iEJDri"">It's a <strong>Trade-In target</strong>, as it's Level 8.</p> </li>  	<li class=""s570a4-11 fcAyyj""> <p class=""s570a4-10 iEJDri"">It's an <strong>Allure target</strong>, as it's DARK.</p> </li>  	<li class=""s570a4-11 fcAyyj""> <p class=""s570a4-10 iEJDri"">It has a useful <strong>banishing effect</strong>, but unlike Caius', it's not triggered at summon and is not compulsory, meaning that you can't burn yourself with it.</p> </li>  	<li class=""s570a4-11 fcAyyj""> <p class=""s570a4-10 iEJDri"">The effect (you banish one card from your hand, then banish a monster with ATK less than or equal to Dual Assembwurm's) <strong><em>does not target</em></strong>, which is pretty neat.</p> </li>  	<li class=""s570a4-11 fcAyyj""> <p class=""s570a4-10 iEJDri"">It also has a <strong>Special Summoning effect</strong>, in case you are running other Cyberse monsters in your build.</p> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  Running 3x copies of Assembwurm along with 1x Caius, 1x Thestalos and 1x Zaborg, not only gives the build 10x targets for Trade-In, but 12x targets for Allure and 10x targets for Tenacity as well. It also offers you a variety of effects that hit your opponent's field, hand and Extra Deck.  &nbsp;  It feels a lot like a pure Monarch Deck with the inclusion of more Monarchs in place of Fiends, and relies on their actual activated effects, as Monarch Decks normally should. The draw potential is insanely good, as there have been instances where I managed to draw/mill over half of my deck by the end of turn 3. It definitely feels bigger and faster, so it's still a fun and competitive deck to use against decks like Elemental HERO (the Side Deck I suggested can potentially make this build more competitive in matches against top tier decks)."

I combine that with <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> and <a data-name=""Tsukuyomi"">Tsukuyomi</a> to continually disrupt my opponent over and over until I can sufficiently reduce their LP.  I also prefer to run 1 copy of Terraforming as I've had a few matches where I've had difficulty drawing <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a>..

However, some ""roid"" <a title=""Support"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Support"">support</a> cards specify Machine-Type ""roid"" monsters.

Patience is a requirement for this Deck, as it requires a great deal of time to create and run the Deck perfectly. Stronger beatdown styles often include a ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>"" and often use it to summon ""<a title=""Chimeratech Overdragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Chimeratech_Overdragon"">Chimeratech Overdragon</a>"". ""<a title=""Rainbow Life"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Rainbow_Life"">Rainbow Life</a>"" combined with ""<a title=""Ambulanceroid"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Ambulanceroid"">Ambulanceroid</a>"", ""<a title=""Rescueroid"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Rescueroid"">Rescueroid</a>"", ""<a title=""Decoyroid"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Decoyroid"">Decoyroid</a>"", and ""<a title=""Cyber Summon Blaster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cyber_Summon_Blaster"">Cyber Summon Blaster</a>"" on the field can wipe out your opponent's life points. Alternatively, ""<a title=""Spirit Barrier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Spirit_Barrier"">Spirit Barrier</a>"" to replace ""<a title=""Rainbow Life"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Rainbow_Life"">Rainbow Life</a>"" works almost as well against most Decks however cards like <a title=""Dimension Wall"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimension_Wall"">Dimension Wall</a> works effectively in Roid Decks as many of the Roids are very weak and reflecting damage back at your opponent can be critical. This Deck is also very effective against Decks made around ""<a title=""Bad Reaction to Simochi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Bad_Reaction_to_Simochi"">Bad Reaction to Simochi</a>"".  Another highly used combo is ""<a title=""Chain Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Chain_Material"">Chain Material</a>"" and ""<a title=""Vehicroid Connection Zone"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Vehicroid_Connection_Zone"">Vehicroid Connection Zone</a>"". The summoned monster will survive the effect of Chain Material (thanks to the effect of ""Vehicroid Connection Zone"") and you will have a very powerful monster on the field. This allows you to <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Fusion"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fusion"">Fusion</a> summon from your Deck in a similar manner to ""<a title=""Future Fusion"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Future_Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>"". The only drawback is that you cannot attack the turn you use this combo, though it is negligible, as the monster summoned is impervious to effect destruction, and its effect cannot be negated. Prior to the release of ""<a title=""Stardust Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a>"", this combo was considerably more powerful, since most players would be unprepared to deal with a monster that had this kind of protection; since almost all Decks now include ""<a title=""Stardust Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a>"", cards that can work around this effect are far more commonly used.  Vehicroid Decks tend to keep great hand advantage with the use of ""<a title=""Expressroid"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Expressroid"">Expressroid</a>"", and ""<a title=""Supercharge"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Supercharge"">Supercharge</a>"". Vehicroid Decks can easily utilize cards like ""<a title=""Card Destruction"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>"", ""<a title=""Hand Destruction"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_Destruction"">Hand Destruction</a>"", and ""<a title=""Dark World Dealings"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_World_Dealings"">Dark World Dealings</a>"" to get more monsters in the graveyard.  By using ""<a title=""Cycroid"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cycroid"">Cycroid</a>"" along with cards like ""<a title=""Natural Tune"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Natural_Tune"">Natural Tune</a>"", this Deck can become <a title=""Synchro Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon"">Synchro</a> capable.

Still needs some improvements (more field destructions and defensive traps).,"The main strategy is to get Chaos Golem out as soon as possible (I recommend to go as second, so you can attack at first) and as often as possible.  Once he is out, just blast of the opponents field with his brute force, spell/trap (and in BP monster effect) immunity and multi-attacks.  Another helper is reactor dragon which can block spell/traps during battle phase and can clear the opponents back row after attacking. Tribute sommuning him with Geartown and Ancient Gear Gadget grants you a cheap and strong monster.  A good kickstarter for the first turn is Catapult and Geartown to search out Wyvern / Dog / Dragon and fuse Giant.  Future Fusion can be used to get a Chaos Giant, then banish the sent materials with overload fusion and get two Giants (one immediately, one in the next turn) with that combo.  Howitzer is used for different situations, because he could either search Wyvern (further searching), Dog (fusion summon) or Dragon (Attacker/Defender)"

""Photon"" monsters are unique in that they often have effects that play with the <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Rule of 2000"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Rule_of_2000"">Rule of 2000</a>– many of the archetype's low-level monsters feature 2000+ <a title=""ATK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ATK"">ATK</a> to make them viable sacrifices for ""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"", while also augmenting their abilities as beaters. However, because of their incongruously high ATK, low-Level Photons often come with restriction effects to balance out their power. For example, the effect of ""<a title=""Photon Crusher"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_Crusher"">Photon Crusher</a>"" is mimics early beatdown favorite ""<a title=""Goblin Attack Force"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Goblin_Attack_Force"">Goblin Attack Force</a>"", forcing it into <a title=""Defense Position"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Defense_Position"">Defense Position</a> after every attack (its DEF is 0), while ""<a title=""Photon Thrasher"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_Thrasher"">Photon Thrasher</a>"" is a <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Semi-Nomi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Semi-Nomi"">Semi-Nomi</a> monster that can only attack if it is alone on the field. The <i>TCG</i>/<i>OCG</i> original Level 3 ""<a title=""Photon Sabre Tiger"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_Sabre_Tiger"">Photon Sabre Tiger</a>"" loses 800 ATK if it's the only copy of itself on your side of the field, but sports 2000-point <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Original ATK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Original_ATK"">Original ATK score</a> if more than one exists.  ""Photon"" monsters are generally difficult to defeat in battle (most notably ""Galaxy-Eyes"", which can never lose at one-on-one combat due to its effect, if not interrupted). However, the archetype focus most of its effort towards offensive plays, and lacks defensive capacity– featuring little to no protection against hostile card effects.  &nbsp;"

Jerome McHale explained in a <a class=""external text"" rel=""nofollow"">post on Pojo</a> that the reason this archetype name was localized to ""Machina"" from ""Machiners"" was that the former name ""clearly demonstrates that these are Machine-Type monsters, not other types of monsters that do work on machines.""  The archetype involves either getting the three ""Machina"" <a title=""Monster Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Card"">monsters</a> onto your <a title=""Field"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Field"">field</a> and using the effect of ""<a title=""Commander Covington"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Commander_Covington"">Commander Covington</a>"" to <a title=""Special Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Summon"">Special Summon</a> ""<a title=""Machina Force"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Force"">Machina Force</a>"" or the quick Summoning of ""<a title=""Machina Fortress"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a>"". <h3><span class=""mw-headline"">Playing style</span></h3> Before the release of <i><a title=""Machina Mayhem Structure Deck"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Mayhem_Structure_Deck"">Machina Mayhem Structure Deck</a></i>, this Deck was not a <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""TCG"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/TCG"">TCG</a></i> Deck. Unfortunately, after the release of <i>Machina Mayhem</i>, ""<a title=""Machina Sniper"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Sniper"">Machina Sniper</a>"" didn't have the 'two-card lock' wording that ""<a title=""Marauding Captain"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Marauding_Captain"">Marauding Captain</a>"", ""<a title=""Magician's Valkyria"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Magician%27s_Valkyria"">Magician's Valkyria</a>"" and ""<a title=""Morphtronic Magnen"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Morphtronic_Magnen"">Morphtronic Magnen</a>"" had, you couldn't block your opponents' attacks. ""<a title=""Machina Soldier"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Soldier"">Machina Soldier</a>"" could <a title=""Special Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Summon"">Special Summon</a> another ""Machina"", but usually that would not be enough. The concept was completely ignored until the Structure Deck was released.  The core components of a""'Machina"" Deck are ""<a title=""Machina Fortress"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a>"", ""<a title=""Machina Gearframe"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Gearframe"">Machina Gearframe</a>"" and ""<a title=""Machina Peacekeeper"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Peacekeeper"">Machina Peacekeeper</a>"" because of their versatility in any <a title=""Machine"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machine"">Machine</a> oriented Deck. ""<a title=""Machina Force"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machina_Force"">Machina Force</a>"" also has a place, but only because it is an easy fodder for the Summoning requirement of ""Fortress"" that can be easily searched by ""Gearframe"". A common loop in all ""Machina"" Deck variants is that ""Gearframe"" and ""Peacekeeper"" search for each other, always ensuring that there is a <a title=""Machine"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Machine"">Machine</a>-<a title=""Type"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Type"">Type</a> monster ready for the <a title=""Discard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Discard"">discard</a> cost of ""Fortress"".  Basically, the main strategy is to Tribute Machine-Type monsters to Summon more powerful Machine-Type monsters. It's harder than it looks, but when it's done right, you can easily defeat your opponent. Using cards like ""<a title=""Time Machine"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Machine"">Time Machine</a>"" and ""<a title=""Dimensional Prison"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dimensional_Prison"">Dimensional Prison</a>"" to protect your monsters until you can combine them is one way to ensure victory. Using ""<a title=""Swords of Revealing Light"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Swords_of_Revealing_Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>"" when you have all the monsters needed to Summon ""Machina Force"" also works. This gives you enough time to complete the process.  Using the ""<a title=""Gadget"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gadget"">Gadgets</a>"" is also recommended, since they can search for more Machine-Type monsters to be used to Summon ""Machina Fortress"". ""<a title=""Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dekoichi_the_Battlechanted_Locomotive"">Dekoichi the Battlechanted Locomotive</a>"" is a good Draw engine, and it is a good target for ""<a title=""Black Salvo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Salvo"">Black Salvo</a>"" for an easy <a title=""Level"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Level"">Level</a> 7 <a title=""Synchro Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon"">Synchro Summon</a> (such as ""<a title=""Black Rose Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Rose_Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>""). Another good card for this Deck is ""<a title=""Cyber Valley"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cyber_Valley"">Cyber Valley</a>"" because of its effect to stop the <a title=""Battle Phase"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_Phase"">Battle Phase</a> and to <a title=""Draw a card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Draw_a_card"">draw a card</a>.  Another decent combo in the ""Machina"" archetype that you can use is to <a title=""Equip"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Equip"">equip</a> ""<a title=""Cyber Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cyber_Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>"" with ""<a title=""Armored Cybern"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Armored_Cybern"">Armored Cybern</a>"". By keeping them in <a title=""Defense Position"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Defense_Position"">Defense Position</a> you have a good defense and an even better offense. When you equip ""Armored Cybern"" to ""Cyber Dragon"" you can <a title=""Destroy"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Destroy"">destroy</a> a card by giving up 1000 <a title=""ATK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/ATK"">ATK</a>. You can also equip it to ""<a title=""Proto-Cyber Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Proto-Cyber_Dragon"">Proto-Cyber Dragon</a>"" to do the exact same thing, but you can only do it once without an <a title=""Equip Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Equip_Card"">Equip Card</a> to boost its ATK. By using ""Proto-Cyber Dragon"" first and then upgrading it to ""Cyber Dragon"" you can easily keep your monsters safe until you can Summon ""Machina Fortress"" or ""Machina Force"". ""<a title=""Roll Out!"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Roll_Out!"">Roll Out!</a>"" can be extremely helpful in this case (either by recycling the effect of ""Armored Cybern"" or providing more protection for your ""Cyber Dragon"").  Also, using ""<a title=""Future Fusion"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Future_Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>"" to Summon ""<a title=""Chimeratech Overdragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Chimeratech_Overdragon"">Chimeratech Overdragon</a>"" is a good way to send copies of ""Machina Fortress"" to the <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Graveyard"">Graveyard</a>. This can be timed along with the effect upon destruction of ""<a title=""Geartown"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Geartown"">Geartown</a>"" to Special Summon ""<a title=""Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Gear_Gadjiltron_Dragon"">Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon</a>"". That's a good strategy to get your monsters to the Graveyard. It's not the best strategy, as ""Chimeratech Overdragon"" sends all other monsters you control to the Graveyard when Summoned this way, but it's still a powerful one and you can Summon the ""Machina Fortress"" once ""Chimeratech Overdragon"" is destroyed. This can also work with ""<a title=""The Last Warrior from Another Planet"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Warrior_from_Another_Planet"">The Last Warrior from Another Planet</a>"", though it is not a Machine-Type.  With nearly constant discard fodder of ""Machina Fortress"", numerous decent-ATK monsters, and a destruction-saving <a title=""Union monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Union_monster"">Union monster</a>, this kind of Deck plays with relentless <a title=""Beatdown"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Beatdown"">Beatdown</a> and some field &amp; hand control.  &nbsp;"

This deck is made to go second every time and otk your opponent very fast! Use the Mekk-Knight monsters to overwhelm your opponent and my spicy tech card <a data-name=""Psychokinesis"">Psychokinesis</a>! Being able to control your opponent using the Sky Striker spell cards make boards very easy to control and manipulate. My favorite spicy tech card I added to this deck for you guys is the decks normal summon, <a data-name=""Psychic Snail"">Psychic Snail</a>! Some of you may remember this card from the 5D's era of Yu-Gi-Oh back in 2008 through the end of 2011. This card's effect says that you can pay 800 life points to make one of your psychic monsters attack twice during this turn. That means you can special summon many Mekk-Knights, then normal summon Psychic Snail and use his effect to give all your Mekk-Knight monsters a second attack that turn and otk your opponent. This deck is meta and is a lot of fun to play!"

One of the strongest Plant-Type monsters is ""Tytannial, Princess of Camellias"" at 2800 ATK. It has the power to negate any card effects that target simply by sacrificing a Plant-Type monster (which in worst case scenario can even be herself). It can be easily Summoned by Tributing ""Lonefire Blossom"". In power and strategy, ""Tytannial, Princess of Camellias"" is followed by ""Gigaplant"", which has 2400 ATK and the power to Special Summon Plants from the Graveyard and hand. <h4 class=""page-header__title""><a class=""image image-thumbnail"" title=""Akiza Izinski""> <img class=""pi-image-thumbnail"" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/b/b1/Akiza_Izinski.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20160620134315"" srcset=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/b/b1/Akiza_Izinski.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20160620134315 1x, https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/b/b1/Akiza_Izinski.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20160620134315 2x"" alt=""Akiza Izinski"" width=""270"" height=""152"" data-image-key=""Akiza_Izinski.png"" data-image-name=""Akiza Izinski.png"" /> </a></h4> &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The mekk-knights and weather painters can search each other easily, so you can grab any card you want in the deck.</li>  	<li>Flexibility. 60 cards allows you to run 1s of some cards (e.g. weather painter spells) that you may not have room for in a 40 card deck. As everything is searchable, if the situation arises you can easily get these cards to relieve yourself from a sticky situation.</li>  	<li>Less bricks. The chance of drawing cards like psy-frame driver decreases significantly, so you can get better opening hands.</li> </ol> Feel free to ask any questions!  https://youtu.be/ibT6-2QGxg0"

As of Jun. 2019 it has remained pretty much untouched and still comfortably sits at Tier 2-3. The goal of True Draco is, still, to grind out the opponent by accruing advantage and locking them out of key components of their gameplan. With this floodgate oriented gameplan, however, True Draco is susceptible to removal, bricking, and having its floodgates falter. Overall the simple floodgate, beatdown, and grinding gameplan is still successful despite the strong side decks that are ever-present and able to even the matchup against this deck.  Having said that Draco relies on floodgates, here are a few techs to consider that I don't run: 1. Lose 1 turn  is a pseudo monarchs erupt that works well in Extra Deck draco 3. Quiet Life is a very oppressive floodgate that effectively shut downs any deck that relies on its Extra Deck 4. Skill Drain is a worse, and riskier, monarchs erupt 5. The Solemn Brigade (Solemn Strike, Solemn Warning, Solemn Judgement) can fit in just about any control deck.  Gameplan: - Establish your floodgates while setting up a board with big beaters and recovery.  Important Cards 1. Diagram: Your primary searcher 2. Card of Demise: Huge consistency booster 3. Ignis: Searches Searches TD spells 4. Dinomight: Searches TD traps 5. Maiden: Adds the better TD monsters 6. Traps: Crackdown, Erupt, Summon Limit and There Can Be Only One all cripple various strategies whilst Imperial Order can eliminate several altogether."

You should have Grapha in your graveyard, maybe using trade-in, or you can discard it thanks to the effect of Portals. Try to special summon 2 more monsters (at least 1 dark world): now you can make a link 2 and thanks to firewall you can special summon 1 monster from your hand, which will be a dark world: now activate grapha's effect and special summon it by returning a dark world to your hand. Now you can special summon a link 3 (grapha + link 2), maybe Unicorn or tri-gate magician and special summon a dark world from your hand (the same which has returned to your hand in order to special summon Grapha).  Now you should have Firewall + link 3 + Grapha on your field: at this point you can activate firewall's effect to bring a danger! back to your hand and activate its effect. You should have at least 2 cards in your hand (a danger and a dark world, which is supposed to be Beiige or Goldd): if your opponent chooses the danger, you will discard it and activate its effect (if Chupacabra you can summon a danger from GY) and if he chooses the dark world you can special the danger, special Beiige/Goldd and draw 1 card, then you can make a link 2/3 using Grapha and other monsters and, if the carded you've just drawn was a monster, you can special summon it thanks to firewall.  &nbsp;"

The archetype's main strategy is almost entirely based on tightening their defense and loading the Graveyard, since most support for the Gusto archetype requires shuffling at least 2 or more Gusto monsters into the Deck. The Deck relies on heavy defensive tactics, beginning with its trio of searchers which form what Duelists refer to as ""the recruiter loop"": ""<a title=""Winda, Priestess of Gusto"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Winda,_Priestess_of_Gusto"">Winda, Priestess of Gusto</a>"", ""<a title=""Gusto Gulldo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gusto_Gulldo"">Gusto Gulldo</a>"" and ""<a title=""Gusto Egul"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gusto_Egul"">Gusto Egul</a>."" These three cards can continuously search one another out of the Deck when destroyed in battle while simultaneously filling the Graveyard with monsters, which can be utilized later with effects such as ""<a title=""Caam, Serenity of Gusto"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Caam,_Serenity_of_Gusto"">Caam, Serenity of Gusto</a>"", ""<a title=""Pilica, Descendant of Gusto"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Pilica,_Descendant_of_Gusto"">Pilica, Descendant of Gusto</a>"", and their Synchro Monsters as well.  Overall, Gusto Decks are naturally passive, having a resilient defensive strategy and great recycling/draw power.

This is the final result with equimax being the most expensive card in this list. If you have any suggestions or questions about combos/synergies hmu!</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Here are some of my thoughts on the cards and ratios I chose:</p>  <ul class=""yklcuq-12 kuqpqj"">  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Black Garden: Super good addition to the deck since it solves the problem of your opponent passing with an empty field. Just remember to switch to the other fieldspell before summoning equimax or else you miss out on some damage. It is also the main reason why I chose to go with 3 Arboria and Maximus. When starting your plays just start off with Garden, and then normal summon Maximus and link up. Then pop the garden to get him right back and trigger the search. Same with Arboria but after the NS.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">-Iblee Package: A double edged sword sure but a strong first turn play if you know it'll hinder your opponent. Also provides an attack target for Equimax. The combo is fairly easy: NS any Crusadia Monster, link it, summon a second one to get the search, link into Knightmare Flamingo (pop a spell if you have the ressources), link into Mermaid and discard for Iblee, Link into Underclock Taker to summon Iblee on their side. Now you even can summon any Crusadia to a Zone UT points to to go directly into Equimax.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Instant Fusion: Great for summoning to a link marker to get off any effects of your Crusadia Links. Thousend Eyes can get rid of any monster (even face-down ones) or Milennium Eyes can protect your search effects from being hand trapped.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Sky Striker Drones: Basically same as IF but results in an extra token for link plays.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Linkuriboh: Can be used on any of the restricts or the SS token or Effect Veiler in some fringe cases.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Gagaga Cowboy: Doesnt come up too often but has won me some games.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">FA Dawn Dragster: Great first turn play and not that hard to pull off since Arboria is a Tuner. Keep in mind though that it wont boost your Crusadia Links since its original atk is 0.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Kaijus: Great addition to this deck. Gets rid of the bad guys that can negate your combo pieces and boosts your Equimax. If you place your and your opponents kaijus correctly, he even gets boosted twice. Can also trigger your Crusadia links if you summon your Kaiju on a linked zone.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Pot of desires: Great when fishing for combo extenders, only use it after you did your searches tho.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Crusadia Trap: The ""Master Peace"" of the deck. During your opponents turn you can tribute a Crusadia Monster to get Recursia. Pop the trap itself or the fieldspell and a monster for free.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Things I decided against playing because of preference or budget: -More handtraps: Budget killer no1 and I dont like them in a combo heavy deck. Yeah sure you can disrupt your opponent more but you also fuck your own hand over.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">-Rescue Cat and Elephun for Naturia Beast: Too unsafe for my taste so you only really can use it with an Instant Fusion for restrict or Called by the Grave in hand. If this gets negated you have to basically pass Also it's pretty bad if you draw your tuner or multiple Cats. FA Dawn Dragster fit my playstyle much better and freed up so many spaces in the main deck.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">More of the Sky Striker Engine: Budget Buster. Would definitely play 3 Engages if you have them.</p>"

The main plan is to get level eater to be in the graveyard (it can be done by a lot of cards like foolish burial and more smartly quick draw synchron but some times u end up sending it to graveyard by battle destruction). Now you have level eater in grave you need one of the black wing either (decay) or (gofu) if u use Gofu simply use level eater effect which make gofu level 4 and then synchro summon sohaya the rainstorm because of sohaya effect which turns it to a tuner when use a black wing as a material then use level eater again to summon sohaya again (yes I'm not stupid) with sohaya effect u can summon 1 blackening wing from your grave yard summon the other sohaya then again use level eater effect on the tuner sohaya to summon accel synchron which has a effect that sends 1 synchron monster to the graveyard and increase its level by the level of that monster ..send jet synchron which has a effect ( u can summon it by discarding 1 card ) then use level eater again (dont worry almost  last time  XD) to decrease accel synchron level and summon formula synchron by using jet synchron and level eater then use level eater on accel synchron to summon another lv 5 (better to summon the last sohaya) then from there summon shooting quasar and boom that's it .  U can also summon other synchro monsters with other tuners like junk synchron etc.. also have a level 5 ready (sohaya effect from the the graveyard that's it then figure out rest and summon other synchros ..  &nbsp;  (also if u use decay the black wing just use his effect to increase its level by 1)the same process. <ul>  	<li>Thanks hope u like my deck</li> </ul>

If you have <a data-name=""Celestial Transformation"">Celestial Transformation</a> and two Timelords in hand, there's a couple of XYZ summons you can make, but chances are you'll be wanting <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a>'s instant 2000LP attack. Hilariously, that can mean a three-card OHKO! But keep in mind though that some of the cards in this deck prevent Special Summoning.  The Windwitch combo is where you start with <a data-name=""Windwitch - Ice Bell"">Windwitch - Ice Bell</a> and end up with a destroy-immune <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> and a 1300LP weaker opponent. The steps are: Ice Bell -&gt; Glass Bell -&gt; Snow Bell -&gt; synchro summon Winter Bell (for the Life Points damage) -&gt; synchro summon Crystal Wing.  Not bad for a one-card combo! As well as being a really strong monster, Crystal Wing's effect negation can also be used to negate your (Special Summoned) Timelords' self-destruction effects. Getting Glass Bell or Snow Bell in hand is not so ideal, but they can be exchanged for a second Ice Bell if you draw one too.  As for the spells... will need some explanation.  <a data-name=""Pot Of Duality"">Pot Of Duality</a> and <a data-name=""Card Of Demise"">Card Of Demise</a> exploit that the Timelords are Normal Summoned, so there's little drawback. Card Of Demise might seem silly in a deck that can only play one monster a turn, but it's important for consistency - if you don't have a monster in a turn, you basically lose. <a data-name=""Ante"">Ante</a> will basically always deal 1000LP at no card disadvantage. <a data-name=""Chain Energy"">Chain Energy</a> works because almost every other deck is more combo-reliant than this one. <a data-name=""Mound Of The Bound Creator"">Mound Of The Bound Creator</a> protects the Timelords, but keep in mind that XYZ summons aren't protected. Indestructible monsters means <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute "">Torrential Tribute</a> will only ever hit the opposing side. And finally, <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> is the real high-risk-high-reward card - goes a long way to protecting your monsters, but also negates half the deck.  &lt;!--more--&gt;  ...Oh yeah, and the extra Link and Summon monsters are just there for very special situations. Don't expect to be using them.  &nbsp;  As for cards left out that you may want to consider: <a data-name=""Zaphiron, The Timelord"">Zaphiron, The Timelord</a>'s trap-destroying ability is ridiculously strong, but unactivated-even-after-battle spells/traps are usually not something to worry about with this deck. <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon Of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon Of Ra - Sphere Mode</a> can be searched if your Mound Of The Bound Creator gets destroyed, but that's not so useful in a deck that aims to block all attacks from no matter how many monsters. And <a data-name=""Savage Colosseum"">Savage Colosseum</a> has really strong potential because it makes your Timelord effects activate twice, while burning them in the process, but protecting your Timelords is typically more important."

Going first, going second, control based, OTK based, it can adapt to almost any situation it is put into and more often than not comes out on top.  The primary strategy of the deck is to blind second, stun your opponent with a handtrap or two, then proceed to either overwhelm them with resources or outright OTK them if you've drawn into your combo pieces. It's unbelievably consistent - proven by the fact that it's gone 12-0 at the last 3 locals I've taken it to. Even more astounding is the fact that it is not even the most optimal build - lacking <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> completely as well as a 3rd Engage and Widow Anchor.  The Invoked engine - used as the main aggressor of the deck, comprises of 3 <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a>; 3 <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>; 2 <a data-name=""Invocations"">Invocations</a>. Along with the 2 copies of <a data-name=""Terraforming "">Terraforming</a>, this is the engine you'd want to see as early on in the duel as possible.  The Sky Striker engine - the control aspect of the deck, and perfectly playable as an engine by itself until you draw into your invoked cards. 2 <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a> gets you to your Hornet Drones which enables the OTK. Aleister + Hornet Drones is an OTK almost all of the time.  The Spellbook engine - used for draw power and consistency. The fact that the deck runs so many spellcastsers means that these cards are almost never ""dead"" in your hand.  The Handtraps - as mentioned, Ash Blossom should certainly be included in an optimised build. This can be tweaked according the the metagame, but you'd ideally want to run between 8-10 of them. Ogre and Veiler are still preferred due to the fact of them being LIGHT tragets for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>.  The Rest - the remainder of the deck is down to user preference. I've gone with the <a data-name=""Toon Table of Contents"">Toon Table of Contents</a> as it's an easy way to fuel your grave with spells and out any monster(s) in the extra monster zone(s). Added to that is the fact that it's an easy bait for negates. <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> is certainly something to consider running if your wallet allows for it.  The Extra deck - quite self explanatory. I feel the ratios of everything is correct, although you might argue that <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a> could be sided instead, and either of the (good) Borrel-dragons be added in its place.  The Side deck - completely up to what the user thinks would work in any given tourney/meta. I've gone for things which help against perhaps the deck's worst match-up - Altergeist.  Weaknesses - backrow heavy decks, OTK-based decks where Kaijus are mained. Other than these, which can be sided for and played around in games 2 and 3, the deck has very little ways to be overcome.  I feel that for people wanting to play something versatile, fun and highly competitive this deck certainly is a must have. If you're willing to drop the cash for it, you'll be greatly rewarded."

And this is my take on Pure Sky Striker since it is considered ""the best deck"" right now and has topped every event basically. This build can go first or second but taking into consideration today's meta, going first is probably your best option taking into consideration of how powerful decks like Goukis can be. The deck is very powerful because you can abuse <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye"">Sky Striker Ace - Raye</a> and special summon the Sky Striker links constantly. Being able to get 3 or more cards on your turn because of <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a> is insane. This deck list is very similar to the one that won the 200th YCS in Columbus, Ohio but with a few changes. Using <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a> to summon tokens to use for link summons is very powerful. This deck is very easy to use and can be used by anyone after playing it a couple times. Many more decks to come soon! Stay tuned :)."

Cyber Dragon Infinity can negate monster effects as well as spell and trap effects, destroying them. Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord can also negate and destroy cards, but it's really good because it can add Photon or Galaxy cards to your hand.  I side decked Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon because you can use it to OTK your opponent and if your opponent is using a Xyz Deck, then you can use Neo to get rid of their overlay units and attack all the monsters.  My favorite card in this deck is Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon because I like OTK wins. This is a good card to OTK because it's attack can almost reach up to 9000!"

Some cards even h,Raidraptor - Force Strix is a good card to bring out at the beginning of your duel because it helps search for other Raidraptor cards to make new Xyz monsters like Raidraptor - Rise Falcon.  Raidraptor- Rise Falcon is mostly used when your opponent has a high ATK monster like Chaos Ancient Gear Giant. Its effect helps gain the ATK of the opponent's monster and let's it to attack every special summoned monster they control.  Cards like Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon and Raidraptor - Final Fortress Falcon are really powerful cards. Especially Ultimate Falcon because its unaffected by card effects and can even lower monster's ATK points on your opponent's side of the field. If your opponent does not control any monsters then your can inflict effect damage to your opponent instead.  I included Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon and Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon - Airraid because they help summon other Xyz monsters. The downside of this is that they are not yet released in TCG so feel free to change those two cards when making your won deck.

Now you have level eater in grave you need one of the black wing either (decay) or (gofu) if u use Gofu simply use level eater effect which make gofu level 4 and then synchro summon sohaya the rainstorm because of sohaya effect which turns it to a tuner when use a black wing as a material then use level eater again to summon sohaya again (yes I'm not stupid) with sohaya effect u can summon 1 blackening wing from your grave yard summon the other sohaya then again use level eater effect on the tuner sohaya to summon accel synchron which has a effect that sends 1 synchron monster to the graveyard and increase its level by the level of that monster ..send jet synchron which has a effect ( u can summon it by discarding 1 card ) then use level eater again (dont worry almost  last time  XD) to decrease accel synchron level and summon formula synchron by using jet synchron and level eater then use level eater on accel synchron to summon another lv 5 (better to summon the last sohaya) then from there summon shooting quasar and boom that's it .  U can also summon other synchro monsters with other tuners like junk synchron etc.. also have a level 5 ready (sohaya effect from the the graveyard that's it then figure out rest and summon other synchros ..  &nbsp;  (also if u use decay the black wing just use his effect to increase its level by 1)the same process. <ul>  	<li>Thanks hope u like my deck</li> </ul>

Its effect doesn't let your opponent add cards into their hand except by drawing them and also protects itself by banishing 1 Thunder Dragon monster in the graveyard.  I saw some similar decks in YouTube and almost none of them use the Thunder Dragon trap card support. However, I included them because they help protect your cards, destroy your opponents spell/trap cards, and special summon more monsters.  There is no side deck because most of the cards are already being used in the main deck.  Make sure to like and comment deck requests!!!  D/D/D Deck Profile coming soon!!!"

There are so many card references in the texts that I simply have compiled a list that should be (most because of incompleteness until further updates) all the cards found within. I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but simply cannot be helped.  This deck is called Madoltrick, a Link-Friendly, modern version of a previously popular deck known as Trick-or-Treat. Trick-or-Treat is a deck style based around combining the incredible stalling and negating power of the Ghostrick archetype with the swarming and all around strong attack and effects of the Madolche archetype, in order to provide the Madolches with the time they needed to set up, and give the Ghostricks the attack power they lacked. However, this build is more of a Madolche deck running a Ghostrick engine for support. This was not the original intent, but has provided me with the best results so far. Also, some cards have been teched in, such as Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, Twin Twisters, and Borreload Dragon. The Side Deck contains other techs that might be needed against certain decks (Borrelsword for decks that run multiple high-attack monsters, Ghost Ogre for decks that rely heavily on the effects of monsters, spells, or traps).  PART 1 – The Main Deck  The first part of the deck to look at is the Ghostricks. Although they are meant mostly to stall (and what stalling power they have!), they can also combo rather well alongside the Madolches. The first combo is with Madolche Fresh Sistart. Ramming an opponent’s monster with Sistart can result in you taking a small amount of damage and being able to shuffle one of your Madolche monsters back into your deck (or add back to the hand if you have Chateau on the field). This can be used alongside Ghostrick Mary in order to Summon a Ghostrick Jiangshi from the Deck, and once Jiangshi has been Summoned into face-down defense position, that gives you a free 1800 defense monster. If your opponent attacks Jiangshi, you can add a Lantern or Jackfrost from your deck to your hand to negate another attack, or if your opponent inflicts piercing damage, you can add another Mary to summon another Jiangshi. Although Specter could be added into the deck, I found he was a dead draw most times, and took him out to improve both deck size and deck consistency. Ghostrick Parade is another great combo card. It can be used to stall for time as you gather your Madolches, and can also be used to search out for Lantern, Jackfrost, or Mary. After finishing gathering the resources you need, it can be used to search for Ghostrick Renovation, allowing Reno to saves your Ghostrick Parade and get a free Madolche Chateau. Afterwards, it can be used to change your Ghostrick Xyz monsters to get the effect you need. The Ghostricks can give you extra searching and summoning power, to help Link Summon into either Wee Witch’s Apprentice or Borreload Dragon. The level 1 hand-traps give you access to rank 1 Xyz monsters like Ghostrick Dullahan, who combined with Ghostrick Angel of Mischief, can get over any monster with 4000 or less attack.  Next, the “meat” of the deck, the Madolches. And by “meat”, I mean “sweet”. The most famous Madolche combo is using Madolche Anjelly to Special Summon Madolche Hootcake from your deck, then using Madolche Hootcake to banish Anjelly, allowing you to summon another Madolche out of your deck. If it is a level 3, you could Xyz with it, and previously you would Xyz summon M-X-Saber Invoker, but now with the Extra Deck Zone, and Invoker banned, this is no longer possible. Now, however, with this new monster, you could Xyz into Mechquipped Angineer, Ghostrick Alucard, Leviar the Sea Dragon (this monster allowing you to return Anjelly to the field for a play next turn), or you could Link Summon into Madolche Fresh Sistart, with whom you could combo alongside Ghostrick Mary. If you summon don’t summon a level 3, you can summon Madolche Messengelato to search your deck for one of your Madolche Spell/Trap cards. Afterwards, you can link summon into Sistart. A new option is summoning Madolche Puddingcessoeur. Puddingcessoeur is a strong enough card to warrant its own section, but this combo is used to jump start one of the other combos it can pull off. Another way to jump start a Puddingcessoeur combo is to search it out with Madolche Magileine. Magileine is used to search out for the other Madolches as needed, can be used very effectively to combo alongside Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode, and is yet another stalling card. If not searching for Madolche Anjelly or Puddingcessoeur, Magileine can search for Madolche Magileine, then take some damage from one of your opponents attacks next turn. When it comes to your turn again, you can simply repeat this. Madolche Lesson might seem like an odd card to add, but it doesn’t seem so odd when you have a 2800 ATK Madolche Fresh Sistart and a 3800 Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode. Madolchepalooza simply can swarm the field with Madolche monsters to protect yourself, or activate their effects (Puddingcessoeur, Messangelato). I have fought Madolche decks that use this card to summon Madolche Chouxvalier in order to protect their other monsters from that battle, and is one of the most annoying combos I have ever faced.  The main card to jump start nearly all of all of the combos, other than Madolche Anjelly, is Madolche Puddingcessoeur, the newest Madolche card. It can be Special Summoned with Madolche Hootcake, Madolche Anjelly, Madolche Mewfeuille, Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode, Madolche Ticket, and Madolchepalooza, all but Mewfeuille and Madolchepalooza summoning from the deck. It can Special Summon itself from your hand, as long as you don’t have any monsters in your GY, which means if you Normal Summon Madolche Magileine, it can search for this card, which can then activate its own effect to Special Summon itself. Aside from the fact that Special Summoning any monster is good, this one is especially good because it Special Summons another Madolche monster from the deck, and then lowers its level by one, the only negative effect being that you can only special Summon other “Madolche” monsters for the rest of the turn. This opens up a world of possibilities. The most obvious one is to summon Madolche Puddingcess from your deck, overlay them both to go into Madolche Queen Tiaramisu, then use Tiaramisu to go into Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode with its ability that before was nearly impossible to get. However, other possibilities include Special Summoning this card to get Anjelly, Madolche Anjelly summons Madolche Hootcake, Hootcake banishes Anjelly to Summon Messangelato. Messangelato can then add Madolche Ticket, Madolche Chateau, Madolchepalooza, or Madolche Lesson from your deck to your hand. The strongest combo that I have found personally, with Madolche Magileine and either Madolche Ticket or Madolche Chateau in your hand, relies heavily on this card. Normal Magileine to search Puddingcessoeur, Special Summon Puddingcessoeur to Summon Anjelly, use Anjelly to summon Hootcake, Hootcake to summon Messangelato, who can search for Madolche Ticket or Chateau, whichever you don’t have. From there, you should have Magileine, Puddingcessoeur, Hootcake, and Messangelato. Now, use Hootcake and whichever other monster you want back in your deck to Link Summon into Madolche Fresh Sistart. Activate Ticket, if you haven’t already, and once that is in play, active Chateau. Chateau shuffles your monsters back into the deck, activating Madolche Ticket (Note: if you are going second, it might be wiser to wait before activating Chateau). You can summon whatever, but if you are using Chateau, Madolche Puddingcess is a smart choice, because it will be a monster with spot destruction and 2300 ATK by the end of this combo. Otherwise, I would suggest Madolche Chouxvalier to protect your monsters from at least one battle, not to mention his ATK will be decent with Chateau. After activating ticket, use 2 of your monsters, which you will have if you have followed the steps correctly, to go into Madolche Queen Tiaramisu. If you did not activate Chateau because you are going second, this gives you Madolche cards to activate her ability to get rid of 2 of your opponent’s cards. If you want to, you can rank up into Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode, for the 3000 ATK beat stick, though I would save her for only if you need the extra cards. But enough on this combo. There is so much more to do with, it is not even funny. With other combos alongside Madolche Puddingcessoeur, a rather overlooked one is using Puddingcessoeur to summon Anjelly, Anjelly summons Puddingcess, and you can Tribute Summon a Puddingcess from your hand using Puddingcessoeur. Puddingcessoeur can also be Special Summoned from the dec during your opponent’s turn using Madolche Ticket, thereby bypassing its negative effect of only being able to summon “Madolche” monsters for the rest of the turn (although this does leave your Ghostrick hand traps useless, so be careful if Special Summoning this card and activating its effect during your opponent’s turn.  As much as I could go on with her, we need to move on to other parts of the deck. The final part of the main deck is the tech cards. At the top of the tech cards is an old favorite, Twin Twisters. TT Can use its cost to your advantage: By sending a monster, it can send the cards you need in the GY to activate Tiaramisu, Chocolat-A-La-Mode, Lesson, Hootcake, or you could send Ghostrick Renovation to activate its second effect without having to use a field card first, which might be detrimental to your strategy at the moment. Twin Twisters also can get rid of pesky Spells and Traps your opponent controls, or even get rid of a leftover Ghostrick Parade or Madolche Ticket. The second tech is Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. She has one major use – disruption. Almost all deck strategies in the meta nowadays require at least one card from your opponent’s deck. This instantly puts a stop to their plans. This card also can be used to summon Synchro Monsters, but 99 out of 100 times Tiaramisu: 1) Won’t take up your Normal Summon. 2) Gets around pesky targeting and destruction protection effects. And 3) Activates effects like Ticket, alongside allowing effects like Puddingcess and Puddingcessoeur to activate. In other words, you don’t use Ash Blossom as anything but a hand trap. Still, against rather odd decks specific non-meta decks, even summoning her can disrupt your opponent, so never count it out.  Next, the Extra Deck. I have composed the Extra Deck based on my own experience, but it cards could easily be replaced for preferred cards, Like removing a Downerd Magician for a Ghostrick Angel of Mischied (The Dorklord). First up are the Ghostricks. Although I do run quite a few hand traps in the deck that are level 1 Ghostrick monsters, I only ever need the one Ghostrick Dullahan. Once he comes out, he not only halves the ATK of one of your opponent’s monsters, but he also ranks up into either Downerd Magician, for the extra power and piercing damage against a defensive monster, or Mischief, who allows the searching of either another hand trap, Parade, or Reno, if you already have Parade in your hand or on the field. Add that to the fact that she can reduce your hand size, gives this deck a (though probably never going to happen) alternative win condition, easily summoned by using two level 4 Madolches, and a decent DEF of 2500, she is certainly a strong card, though I found that I usually needed the extra Downerd Magician rather than her. Either of them ranking off of Dullahan will allow you to detach Dullahan quickly to return one of your Ghostrick cards, whether Reno, Parade, or one of the monsters. Ghsotrick Alucard helps with spot removal, and surprisingly effective against any kind of flip effect archetypes. Alucard also helps with a bit of backrow removal, or forcing your opponent to play cards they would rather not play yet.  Next, the Madolches’ Extra Deck. I have already gone over them extensively, so this is more for formality than anything else. The Madolches’ rank 4 monster is also one of the most broken cards of all time, Madolche Queen Tiaramisu. Returning your monsters to your deck, as well as non-target, non-destruction removal, and a monster she can rank-up into for free? The only penalty is the archetype restriction. She can be used to activate Ticket, can be used to recycle Madolches you have in your GY that you will need to have back, such as Extra Deck Monsters, and can be used as a 2700 ATK beatstick with Chateau. There are too many combos to list here with just her, so I am just going to leave it at what has already been said about her. The other Madolche Xyz monster is Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode. I, again, only run two of her because she can recycle herself, or one of the other many returning cards can do it for her. As a rank 5, she would be hard to get if she couldn’t be ranked up onto any other Madolche Xyz monster that is rank 4 or lower (Tiaramisu), but she can be, so that allows for some pretty awesome combos. My favorite is using Puddingcessoeur to Special Summon out if your deck Madolche Puddingcess, and thanks to the level-lowering effect, they can be overlayed to go into Tiaramisu to rank-up into Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode. Chocolat-A-La-Mode also has 3000 ATK with Chateau, meaning that she can play around with the big monsters like Galaxy-Eyes, Blue-Eyes, and other beatstick archetypes. They also have a link monster, Madolche Fresh Sistart. She has made this archetype very playable, even with links now. Only requiring two Madolche monsters, she can first and foremost be used to get two linked zones for your Xyz monsters. A strong combo, assuming you have this card on your field, is to Summon Madolche Queen Tiaramisu, then use both this card and one more Madolche monster you control to Link Summon into another Madolche Fresh Sistart. This gives you two monsters in your GY to then activate Tiaramisu’s ability. Another thing to use with Sistart is during your opponent’s turn; activate her protection effect in order to shuffle a Madolche monster back into your deck. With that, you can activate Madolche Ticket, allowing you to summon a Madolche monster from your deck, with either Messangelato or Puddingcessoeur recommended (personaly, I would go with Puddingcessoeur). During your turn, if you don’t mind giving up your Battle Phase this turn, you can do the same thing by attacking a stronger monster than her to activate her ability.  Finally, the tech-in Extra Deck cards. The most recognizable of these monsters for most Madolche users is Leviair the Sea Dragon. Leviair combos extremely well with Madolche Hootcake, Hootcake banishing a monster from the GY (most notably Anjelly, who was Tributed to summon Hootcake), Summoning a level 3 Madolche monster, and using them to go into Leviair. Leviair can then send one of the Madolches to the GY to summon back Madolche Anjelly from the banish. Although perhaps less usable thanks to M-X-Saber Invoker being banned, Master Rule 4 being in effect, and Puddingcessoeur being released, Leviair does not quite warrant 2 in the deck, but still has too many good combos to pass up. In a late game grind, Leviair also can be used to recover from all of your banished hand traps, such as returning a Ghostrick to be able to Normal Summon your Ghostrick monsters, or bringing back a banished Madolche Queen Tiaramisu, to rank up into Puddingcess Chocolat-A-La-Mode. The other rank 3 Xyz monster is Mechquipped Angineer. Although with the introduction of Kaijus he isn’t as useful, Angineer certainly can stall for time if needed. A simple Anjelly to Hootcake to level 3 monster to this gives you an almost guaranteed 2 turns to gather yourself. Mewfeuille and any other level 3 Madolche monster gives you a quick defense with this, and Angineer helps remove Jiangshi from the field, once you have the hand traps you need, without leaving an opening in your defenses for doing so. Finally, for other Madolche builds based around Fairy Madolche, Angineer doubles as a Fairy type for Fairy support. The last Xyz monster is Downerd Magician. I have already used Downerd to explain combos above, but a small list here won’t hurt. Downerd can be ranked up onto any rank 3 or lower Xyz monster (Dullahan, Angineer, Alucard, Leviair), turning it into a pretty decent beatstick, with piercing capabilities. Downerd’s greatest effect, in my opinion, is its negative effect: Having to detach an xyz material if it attacks or is attacked. This can be used to get monsters into your GY when it would otherwise be empty, for effects like Madolche Puddingcess or Madolche Puddingcessoeur. It also gets monsters for Madolche Hootcake’s effect. Downerd also can activate Alucard’s or Dullahan’s effect. Finally, piercing damage is simply all the more power to Downerd Magician. Next, the link monsters. The first tech in is Wee Witch’s Apprentice, simply there to help remove your Ghostricks and Downerd, as well as give you extra link fodder for the other tech in, Borreload Dragon. Although Borreload doesn’t combo with anything in the deck, he is very helpful when facing a deck that runs multiple high ATK monsters, such as Blue-Eyes, or Monarchs. It also can be used to remove other pesky monsters without running any risk to yourself. Finally, it has the highest base ATK stat in the deck, and is instrumental in dealing with decks that run cards like Full Force Virus (the viruses are probably the #1 major weakness to this deck, alongside Majesty’s Fiend and other Special Summon-negating cards.  More to come on the Side Deck and Weaknesses for the deck later…  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

If you have number 22 on the field dont try to summon Drochshuile from the graveyard either because the effect negation from number 22 is mandatory from what i can tell)  Open to criticism, please try to state a reason for a change in the decklist if you know a possible improvement.

A calculated approach to","This deck is based around combining the Rank 10 Trains archetype with the also-Level-10 Timelords to easily summon Rank 10 XYZs and Superdreanaught Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe. According to my calculations, this has a 91.6% chance of summoning a Super Dora or Juggernaut Liebe on your first turn (85.6% T1, 97.6% T2), if uncountered, and a 64.5% chance of summoning Double Header Anger Knuckles alongside it. And unlike pure Trains, it's got a much better backup strategy in the form of indestructible Timelords - in fact, there's a 21.2% chance it'll win T2/T3 from monster-bypassing damage to begin with!  Here's how it compares to similar decks:  -----Deck: This One Misc cards in deck: 2 XYZ Summon Chance: 91.579% Knuckle+XYZ Summon Chance: 64.4842% Timelords OTK Chance: 17.137% Bonus cards: 0.615277% -----Deck: This One, but with Kaiju instead of some Trains Misc cards in deck: 2 XYZ Summon Chance: 83.14% Knuckle+XYZ Summon Chance: 47.706% Timelords OTK Chance: 17.156% Bonus cards: 0.25347% -----Deck: Kaiju Timelords Misc cards in deck: 6 XYZ Summon Chance: 47.3952% Timelords OTK Chance: 17.129% Kaiju Chance: 61.35% Bonus cards: 0% -----Deck: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/trains-2019/"">Just Trains</a> Misc cards in deck: 6 XYZ Summon Chance: 88.8357% Knuckle+XYZ Summon Chance: 74.941% Bonus cards: 0.953822% -----Deck: Kaiju Trains Misc cards in deck: 5 XYZ Summon Chance: 86.4134% Knuckle+XYZ Summon Chance: 62.0258% Kaiju Chance: 61.35% Bonus cards: 0.878437% &nbsp;  The overall strategy is very minimalistic - no activate-from-hand, no non-summoning spells, only one trap... it relies entirely on the abilities of the summons. Makes it very consistent, in both a good way and a bad way. That being said, just summoning Liebe can remove at least one of the opponent's cards from the field, so it's not defenceless.  The only complicated part is when to summon Anger Knuckle. Basically: whenever you can, but where it will still leave you with a Rank 10 at the end of the turn. Even if it's just to tribute itself for no advantage that turn, it's a good idea.  Always go first, unless you're up against an OTK deck.  &nbsp;  &lt;!--more--&gt;  This is for the TCG/OCG format that YGOPRO uses. For going pure OCG... don't bother, OCG has so many good generic cards that you're better off going with just Trains.  When playing, keep in mind that having a Michion + Michion/Sandaion is a one-turn kill,  Flying Pegasus + Bullet Liner can continuously draw/summon each other, Anger Knuckle should be played if you have a spare Train - even if it's just sent to the GY that turn, Black Luster Soldier is a good play if you think the opponent has a way to counter Liebe, and several of the cards lock you into attacking with Machine or XYZ monsters for a turn.

This will allow you to safely battle and use his tag-out effect to swarm the field with other Gladiator Beasts, before using them as materials for additional extra deck summons; enabling you to control and win the game.  <strong><em>Engines</em></strong>  The deck features multiple ways to summon Dragases during your Main Phase 1, which is optimal for this archetype; below are three examples:  <strong>Rescue Rabbit/Rescue Cat = 1 card combo:</strong>  Normal Summon Rescue Rabbit/Rescue Cat -&gt; Use the effect of Rescue Rabbit/Rescue Cat to Special Summon 2x Andal/Samnite from your Deck -&gt; Send the 2x Andal/Samnite to the GY to Special Summon Dragases.  <strong>Unexpected Dai/Onslaught of the Fire Kings + Level 4 or lower Gladiator Beast = 2 card combo:</strong>  Use Unexpected Dai/Onslaught of the Fire Kings to Special Summon Andal/Laquari from your Deck -&gt; Normal Summon a Level 4 or lower GB -&gt; Send Andal/Laquari + Normal Summoned GB to the GY to Special Summon Dragases.  <strong>Unexpected Dai/Onslaught of the Fire Kings + Rescue Rabbit/Rescue Cat + Test Tiger = 3 card combo w/ the bonus of a Special Summoned Secutor:  </strong>Use Unexpected Dai/Onslaught of the Fire Kings to Special Summon Andal/Laquari from your Deck -&gt; Special Summon Test Tiger from your hand -&gt; Use Test Tiger's effect to shuffle Andal/Laquari back into your Deck to Special Summon Secutor from your Deck -&gt; Normal Summon Rescue Rabbit/Rescue Cat -&gt; Use the effect of Rescue Rabbit/Rescue Cat to Special Summon 2x Andal/Samnite from your Deck -&gt; Send the 2x Andal/Samnite to the GY to Special Summon Dragases. <strong>*** This is the Deck’s strongest power play. Resolving both effects of Secutor and Dragases in one turn will result in you generating massive card advantage and opportunities; it’s arguably a win condition. ***</strong>  <strong><em>Tips</em></strong>  No matter the engine you use to summon Dragases, you always want to ensure that you can use his tag-out effect to Special Summon Augustus and Darius from your Deck, so that you can then trigger their effects to swarm the field with even more GBs. Better yet, if you have your second copy of Darius in your hand at this time, it will allow you to end up with 5 GBs on the field by the start of your Main Phase 2!  <strong>Dragases + Darius (in hand) = 5 Gladiator Beasts on field:</strong>  End of the Battle Phase -&gt; Use Dragases' effect to Special Summon Augustus + Darius from your Deck -&gt; Use Augustus’ effect (Chain Link 1) + Darius’ effect (Chain Link 2) -&gt; Darius Special Summons a GB from your GY (e.g. the first GB used to make Dragases) -&gt; Augustus Special Summons Darius from your hand -&gt; Use Darius' effect to Special Summon a GB from your GY (e.g. the second GB used to make Dragases) -&gt; Main Phase 2.  <strong>From here you can then perform the following combo:</strong>  Send both GBs to the GY (those that were Special Summoned by your copies of Darius), to Special Summon Dragases -&gt; Shuffle Augustus + 2x Darius back into your Deck to Special Summon Andabata -&gt; Use Andabata's effect to Special Summon Gyzarus -&gt; Use Gyzarus' effect to destroy up to 2 cards on the field -&gt; Return Andabata + Gyzarus back into your Extra Deck to Special Summon Tamer Editor.  <strong>At this point you have opened even more possibilities:</strong>  <strong>Option A:</strong>  Use Tamer Editor's effect to Special Summon Heraklinos (to lock down your opponent's Spells/Traps; this becomes even more oppressive if you also happen to have a set Solemn Strike).  <strong>Option B:</strong>  Use Tamer Editor's effect to Special Summon Nerokius -&gt; Use both as Xyz materials to Special Summon Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy, (to restrict your opponent’s Spells and to protect your weaker monster(s) from attacks).  <strong>Option C:</strong>  Use Tamer Editor's effect to Special Summon Gyzarus -&gt; Use Gyzarus' effect to destroy up to 2 more cards on the field.  <strong><em>Caveats</em></strong><em> </em> - The deck is engineered to go second; having to go first will result in very limited actions.  - Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring is the bane of this deck, so make sure to put those Called By the Graves to good use!  - Try to maximize the usage of Gladiator Beast's Respite in combination with looping it back to your hand via the effect of Equeste. Doing so will allow you to sculpt your hand (e.g. shuffling unwanted copies of Andal back into your Deck to keep Rescue Rabbit/Unexpected Dai active), while drawing deeper into your Deck to get to your key cards faster."

I keep them because i like to play on archetype. the side deck is mostly other dark xyz monsters to go with rusty if you want more utility the dark rebellion.

Mekk-Knight Spyral Sky Strikers! This deck can OTK AND control your opponent. The Spyral spell cards fit in with the Sky Striker spell cards and while your opponent will be trying to get rid of the Spyral spell cards, little do they know that you have those Sky Striker spells in your hand waiting to be played and ready to destroy them! The Mekk-Knights helps otk and overwhelm your opponent. This deck wants to go second for sure and using <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> on your opponent really hurts them because then they most likely will have to pass and you can go off like crazy with the Mekk-Knights and Spyral monsters. I really like seeing <a data-name=""Spyral Sleeper"">SPYRAL Sleeper</a> late game whenever you and your opponent run out of resources and it becomes the grind game because then when they see you special summon Sleeper they just scoop since he's so broken, especially when equipped with <a data-name=""SPYRAL GEAR - Last Resort"">SPYRAL GEAR - Last Resort</a>. And lastly, you all know about my spicy tech, <a data-name=""Psychokinesis"">Psychokinesis</a>. Not only does this card destroy your opponents cards but it also provides another spell in grave for the Sky Striker spells. Have fun!"

To help that strategy we have cards like Caius and BLS that can clean the board pretty easily with the offensive ritual monsters. We can also burn a little to accelerate the KO.  The absolute ritual spell can also use Caius and BLS since they are wariors to invoke easyly your Cyber Angel monsters, even from the graveyard.  If you play first you have the possibility to prepare a defensive board with Kristya and Natasha plus some extra monsters as Photon Lord.  The extra deck is usefull to struggle against some match up since we don't have any obligation to play specific cards."

If you play first you can prepare superbolt, with the help of some hand traps and called by the grave it could be pretty though for some decks to break through.  We play 3 fusions to optimize the banishment mechanism and rebuild a board pretty effectively."

Each component can buffer or create a synergy for Lair of Darkness and it's boss monster, Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair.  Main Deck:  The Lair of Darkness cards included are Diabolos, Ahrima, Lilith, and the Lair field spell. The monsters revolve around tributes to get Diabolos and virus trap support on the field, and the field spell provides superb monster removal. It's slow to start and needs a lot of non-archetypal support to engage it's engine. Once, it gets moving, Diabolos can replace itself as a tribute target, granting you additional tribute resources to build up Lair tokens.  The virus trap support includes Eradicator Epidemic, Grinning Grave, and Deck Devastation, for better control and flexibility.  Non-archetypal spell support for Lair of Darkness can include Allure, Foolish Burial, Downbeat, Terraforming and Monster Reborn. These cards greatly speed up Lair of Darkness. Non-archetypal monster support includes Destrudo, Phantom Skyblaster, and Abyss Actor Curtain. These provide free resources that can be used as targets for Downbeat/Lair of Darkness.  In addition to all that dark support, there is a lot of support coming from Trickstars and Sky Strikers.  Trickstars do not directly support Lair of Darkness, but Lair of Darkness and the non-archetypal spell support can greatly support Trickstars. At a small splash of 6 monsters, they provide a massive buffer to buy you time and slowly but surely chip away at your opponent's life points. Candina is highly reliable and should be prioritized for your normal summon. Add Lycoris to pull Candina back, or Lilybell to begin an offensive board set up. Lilybell becomes very powerful as Trickstar cards start to pile up in your GY; use Reincarnation's 2nd effect to capitalize on replenishing your board with Lycoris. Reincarnation can be paired with any of the virus cards, or chained before Droll &amp; Lock to shut down the opponent's hand.  Sky Strikers can provide an abundance of free resources with Hornet Drones, and Raye's self-tributing quick-effect can stack up Lair of Darkness or pull Diabolos out from the grave.  Extra Deck:  Police Patrol was made with Lair of Darkness in mind, but it isn't a terrible card overall. There are other Link-2 monsters that can better fulfill other needs, if you don't need her protective effect.  Kagari if you're going first, Hayate if you're going second.  To get Omega or Beelze out on the field, you'll need to manage your level 3 and level 4 monsters with Destrudo, or use Downbeat on Diabolos along with the Hornet token or a desperate Droll normal summon.  Side Deck:  Designed to lock out your opponent, because this deck can't beat 'em all. If swinging with full power isn't working, banish more of your opponent's key cards and chip away more of their health. Twin twisters is a superior choice for S/T removal, but this deck has only 4 target cards that can benefit from the cost.  twitch.tv/OreoGravy"

What you need: 1 crusadia, 1 ""special-summoner"" (another crusadia, WL Crown, Mekk-Knights, Instant Fusion etc.) and of course Waterfront.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Since the first two are pretty much a given in any crusadia deck, Waterfront is the weak point. If you play the rose garden variant you can increase the consistency by playing Teraforming and Set Rotation, since you play 3 fieldspells then not a bad addition anyways.</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Here's what you do:</p>  <ol class=""yklcuq-13 dHOYQv"">  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Activate Waterfront</p> </li>  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">NS any crusadia (preferably not Draco</p> </li>  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Link up into Magius and SS your second monster to search Draco</p> </li>  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Link into Spatha</p> </li>  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">SS Draco under spatha, get your first monster back, shift draco to the side and SS your added monster.</p> </li>  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Link into Skull Dread with your 3 monsters.</p> </li>  	<li class=""yklcuq-11 godfjz""> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Search Gameciel with Waterfront and SS it with S.D.'s effect to an outer link zone (So Equimax can point to it on your next turn) You now have a live Gameciel with 3300 def and could extend your combos since SD still has 2 unoccupied link zones. Be careful with overextending though. Also keep in mind kaijus are in herently ""kaiju proof"" so there is no real way for your opponent to get rid of it. Actually Lava Golem seems to be the only out I can think of right now.</p> </li> </ol> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">Why this combo is great: -For going first obviously -Individual combo pieces are not useless when drawn without the combo or when going second: You can still search a kajiu with waterfront and use it on your opponent, maybe just don't give them a disruption Kaiju since he could use it against you :) -The Skull Dread climb could also SS a rescue cat for mixup -When your opponent passes turn to you, search another kaiju if they have a monster, NS any crusadia and link SD into equimax to prettymuch instantly punch for game turn 3 after the stun</p> <p class=""yklcuq-10 hpxQMr"">The downsides: Skull dread doesnt draw you cards with this combo and he takes up an esxtra deck space</p>"

Fabled Sekka's Light OTK 2018 Ft. Jerry*db (Going Second) (Post Soul Fusion/SOFU),"Alright so I'm really excited to post this deck because my close friend Jerry and I who you may know from my custom 60 Card Grass Looks Greener Deck have been working on and have come up with an amazing Pure Danger Going Second OTK deck. This deck is insane! Sky Strikers and any other control heavy/stun based deck has a hard time dealing with this deck, especially the Dangers because there are not enough negates to setup for all the cards you have. Jerry reminded me the other day as we were going over the deck and card choices about <a data-name=""Witch of The Black Rose"">Witch of The Black Rose</a> and I said oh your right this card is busted in Dangers since I remember it back from the 5D's era. So I added it in it and then he reminded me of <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a> and <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a> and told me I can <a data-name=""Beelze of The Diabolic Dragons"">Beelze of The Diabolic Dragons</a>. I realized what a busted combo that is and added it all in! Not to mention <a data-name=""Sekka's Light"">Sekka's Light</a> baits ash and literally gives you so much advantage if it goes off. The Fabled engine is another spicy tech in this deck, except I came up with this one. The Fabled cards just spam link monsters like crazy and win you the game. Sometimes going into <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> can be enough to make your opponent cry after you spam all the Dangers out and the other extenders. The reason I don't like <a data-name=""Number 42: Galaxy Tomahawk"">Number 42: Galaxy Tomahawk</a> in this deck is because there is not enough space to fit a bunch of other link monsters like <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> and <a data-name=""Proxy Dragon"">Proxy Dragon</a>. All the extra deck monsters I already have in the deck come up so they are needed. <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> is a <a data-name=""Zoodiac Drident"">Zoodiac Drident</a> <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>. I love having my opponent discard <a data-name=""The Fabled Catsith"">The Fabled Catsith</a> because then I get to pop something for free and it's really annoying to them haha. Once again, huge shoutout to Jerry for helping me with this deck. Jerry is an excellent Yu-Gi-Oh! player and is one of the best card sellers on the Yu-Gi-Oh! market. He has the lowest prices on eBay and has over 30,000 positive reviews on his eBay profile. His eBay store is called Jerry*db, I will provide a link for both his eBay shop and our custom 60 Card Grass Looks Greener Deck below. In that deck description is a more detailed description of Jerry. Please go support us by buying from his store, I guarantee you won't regret it.

Use Swap's effect to send Angler to grave to special summon himself, then use Angler's effect to special two more Nimbles from the deck. After that, you still have your normal summon for Ra/Sphere Mode.</li>  	<li>Frogs and Nimbles make for an excellent special summoning engine.</li>  	<li>Mystik Wok works really well with a normal summoned Ra. You normal summon Ra, pay all but 100 life points, and do your damage. If anything were to happen to Ra, use Mystik Wok to tribute him, get your life points back, then get Immortal Phoenix of the field since Ra went to the graveyard. Immortal Goes back to the graveyard during the end phase, but you get a Sphere Mode when that happens, and you can start the whole cycle over again but with Ra coming back as a 4000 beater next turn.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Mound of the Bound Creator makes all of your level 10 or higher monsters basically indestructible.</li>  	<li>Convulsion of Nature + True Name allows you a free draw and the chance to get Immortal Phoenix in the grave since Ra and Sphere Mode can't be special summoned by this effect.</li>  	<li>Soul Exchange and Stormforth allow you to tribute one of your opponents monsters if you couldn't get a third special summon onto the field. I would try to use Stormforth first since it allows you to still attack same turn.</li>  	<li>Use Moray as needed if you need to get that extra draw power.</li>  	<li>The extra deck is there to help a little with survivability if you can't get Ra out right away. Same goes for the side deck incase you come across a deck that uses traps or can keep attacking your frogs before you can do anything.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

It focuses on the use of ""Umi"", with cards from ""Fury from the Deep"". I also added in more ","(Updated) I have recently got back into Yu-gi-oh! so wanted to try making a deck using some of my old Fury from the Deep structure deck cards. The main card from the deck were ""<a data-name=""Ocean Dragon Lord - Neo-Daedalus"">Ocean Dragon Lord - Neo-Daedalus</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" (Umi), so I decided I wanted to use cards that synergise well with ""Umi"". I also decided that I wanted to keep to the strategy of the deck (using ""Umi"" to reduce the levels of monsters, and using gravity bind to protect my Lvl4 monsters.  Overarching strategy: <ol>  	<li>By using ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"", I can reduce the level of all the monsters, meaning the Lvl7s will only need 1 tribute, and the Lvl5s will not need tributes, allowing my to more easily put out some bigger cards. Also combining ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" with ""<a data-name=""Gravity Bind"">Gravity Bind</a>"" gives all my Lvl4s some protection whilst also letting them attack.</li>  	<li>I wanted to have plenty of search-ability from my monsters so I could keep monsters coming all through the game. In Fury from the Deep, there was no way to search for ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" so I decided to remedy that by adding in 2 ""<a data-name=""Warrior of Atlantis"">Warrior of Atlantis</a>"" cards as well as Terraforming, allowing me to search for all 3 ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"" cards if need be. ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" also allows me to search ""<a data-name=""Lemuria, the Forgotten City"">Lemuria, the Forgotten City</a>"", which could lead to help with some extra deck summons, or provide me with a discard for ""<a data-name=""Umi"">Umi</a>"" abilities. For other searches, I have ""<a data-name=""Stronghold Whale"">Stronghold Whale</a>"" searching ""<a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a>"", ""<a data-name=""The Legendary Fisherman II"">The Legendary Fisherman II</a>"" searching for the big boss monsters. I then have ""<a data-name=""Shark Cruiser"">Shark Cruiser</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Mother Grizzly"">Mother Grizzly</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Deep Diver"">Deep Diver</a>"" to help with further searching of the cards I need.</li>  	<li>I also wanted lots of re-usability from my monsters, and since I had many cards that either tribute, destroy, or banish cards, I needed plenty of revival to accomplish this. Since I had two ""<a data-name=""Fenrir"">Fenrir</a>""s, ""<a data-name=""Friller Rabca"">Friller Rabca</a>"" banishing its self, and ""<a data-name=""Sea Stealth Attack"">Sea Stealth Attack</a>"" banishing more cards, I decided to include ""<a data-name=""Pot of Acquisitiveness"">Pot of Acquisitiveness</a>"", as well as ""<a data-name=""Sea Lancer"">Sea Lancer</a>"" to bring my banished card back so I can re-use them. I especially like ""<a data-name=""Sea Lancer"">Sea Lancer</a>"" as I can bring back all my banished cards by equipping them to him, and the equipped cards will go to the graveyard rather than back to banishment. Also I can revive ""<a data-name=""Sea Lancer"">Sea Lancer</a>"" with ""<a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>"" and then re-use him, and all the banished cards again. For regular revival, ""<a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>"", ""<a data-name=""After the Storm"">After the Storm</a>"", and ""<a data-name=""Torrential Reborn"">Torrential Reborn</a>"". I also decided to add in ""<a data-name=""Divine Dragon Aquabizarre"">Divine Dragon Aquabizarre</a>"" to enable me to retrieve either ""<a data-name=""A Legendary Ocean"">A Legendary Ocean</a>"", or one of the other ""Umi"" substitutes if need be.</li> </ol> That's the main gist with this deck. This is my first deck build since getting back into the game so I'm sure there will be loads of other cards out there that would better compliment this deck. Therefore I'd gladly welcome C&amp;Cs so that I can improve this style of deck further."

With some spicy techs this deck has the pot,"The goal of this deck is to utilize the recursive nature of Destiny Hero Malicious, Jet Synchron, and Glow-Up Bulb and the spammability of the said cards and other cards like Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion and Danger! engine. These cards allow the deck, with their various levels and monster generating ability, to synchro summon powerful monsters from levels 5 - 10 easily. To start you, the read, off with playing the deck - I'm going to highlight the combo that allows you to essentially start your synchro plays. In addition to me giving an intro to this deck, I'd like to note that when going 2nd - Borrelsword &amp; the black luster soldier link allow this deck to OTK with ease but with that potential gained - the synchro spammability of this deck is also hampered by the fact that we're in a link era that requires significant investment to get multiple arrows.  &nbsp;  Introductory Combo (Starter Combo): you just need 1 way to get to needlefiber, whether that be Armageddon Knight - which is a 1 card starter - or rescue cat. It is important to note, however, that Armageddon Knight is better off used to send Destiny Hero Malicious as Mali allows you to Synchro Summon into two level 8s/7s with ease.  Cards in hand: Rescue Cat + Destiny Hero Malicious <ul>  	<li>Normal Rescue Cat, and activate its effect --&gt; using gallis and valeriafawn to make Needlefiber</li>  	<li>SS Needlefiber, bringing out jet synchron</li>  	<li>SS Summon Sorc using Jet Synchron and needlefiber</li>  	<li>Activate Jet Synchron, pitching malicious --&gt; Jet Synchron goes to one of Summon Sorc's zones</li>  	<li>Target Jet Synchron and SS Mecha Phantom Beast-O lion into your other zone (Summon Sorc)</li>  	<li>SS Borreload Savage Dragon, using O-lion + Malicious --&gt; leaves you with Summon Sorc, one zone has borreload savage dragon and you have jet synchron in the other <ul>  	<li>CL 1: Generate O-Lion token in an open (non-Link) zone, CL 2: Borreload target needlefiber --&gt; add 2 counters, ATK raised to 3750</li>  	<li>At this point you can recur Mali to make a level 7 [clear wing or dawn dragster mainly] (and if you have another tuner produced - level 1 - you can go into something like Clear Wing or Scarlight), or you can recur mali to go into a Link 3 with Summon Sorc + Jet + Mali, or you can use the o-lion token + mali + jet synchron to go into a level 10 Synchro (in the event that you're playing something like Ascension Sky Dragon - which would become a 3200 beatstick or Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> The way in which danger helps this combo: they allow you to make better link plays and help with regards to Synchro Summoning on the lower end and higher end of the spectrum (below 7 and above 8).  Spicy Tech Choices: Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree, Galaxy Tomahawk (Rank 7), Number 38 (Rank 8), Dracossack (Rank 7), Zephyros the Elite, Blackwing Steam the Cloak"

Some characteristics that you can find within this deck:  1) Monsters with high power and that always have very easy summoning conditions. 2) Control of the opponent´s gameplay from 2 different approaches: First, limiting the effects he can activate, second, limiting opponent´s ability to special summon monsters. 3) Large amount of tribute fodder using to 2 different mechanics, Edea-Eidos and The prime monarch (trap card). 4) There is a great balance between tribute fodder and tribute summoning monsters. At least 17 tribute fodders and 10 to 13 tribute summoning monsters. 5) It can easily transformed with its sidedeck to face different strategies used by the opponent. 6) Eventhough there is a very big trade-off, decks that rely on banishing cards from the graveyard or that use Macrocosmos. In this case we will loose the ability to bring our tribute fodders from the graveyard. 7) Once monarchs are up, they are difficult tro bring down thanks to the protection of cards like March of the Monarchs. 8) This is the first deck you will see where Monarchs and Hand traps are combined in order to enhance the oppnent´s control."

The idea of the deck is not to otk like most others, but to contend with and utterly destroy meta decks in a duel where you'll have almost complete control from turn 1. Get the discards off for multiple chain effects that will over whelm your opponent then link into whatever monster you may need to solidify the W!

The main goal of this deck is to get your Phoenix Gearfrieds into the graveyard and then use chevalier and supervise along with other equip cards to clear your opponents field while flooding the field with your own monsters. There's also many other ways to pull out gearfried, as well as your tuners, from the graveyard to consistently give you options to spawn strong monsters through syncing, fusing, and especially using the xyz monsters to handle difficult situations.  The equip cards other than supervise are chosen for extremely useful abilities like discarsing set cards or making your monsters attack +100 your opponents monster. Blast with chain is also a great combo with chevalier that allows you to discard an extra card from your opponents field."

Rather than spending resources engaging with the opponent's board, instead channel those resources toward inflicting direct damage. <a data-name=""Hip Hoshiningen"">Hip Hoshiningen</a> (fielded via <a data-name=""Photon Sanctuary"">Photon Sanctuary</a>) can signficantly increase the Watts' damage output and close games earlier. <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a>, <a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>, and <a data-name=""Number 50: Blackship of Corn"">Number 50: Blackship of Corn</a> contribute burn damage and decrease the number of direct attacks needed.  In the spirit of the original Watts, the rest of the deck focuses on stun and distruption. <a data-name=""Wattgiraffe"">Wattgiraffe</a> prevents floating effects from activating and protects any summons from the Extra Deck during Main Phase 2. Giraffe's stun is especially potent when combined with <a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>.  Finally, cards like <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a> and <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a> are especially noxious here. Monsters pinned face-down will never be attacked or removed from the field, since the Watts can ignore them and attack directly. Strategies focusing on Link Monsters tend to make Quaking less effective than Floodgate, which is still used to flip monsters face-down before they can be used as material. But in general, there is no shortage of opposing boss monsters in the forms of Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and good old-fashioned Effect Monsters that all fall (or 'flip') to these traps.  <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Don't expect a YCS top. Nevertheless, the Watts are an incredibly fun engine that plays competently, challenges your opponent to adapt, and feels genuinely unique to pilot.  &nbsp;"

I also want to say how grateful I am that I have you all viewing my decks and keeping up with me. Your support encourages me to continue posting and making cool decks for you guys. Also as a life update for everyone, I find myself being able to post on the weekends so look out for a new deck every weekend (this includes Friday). This deck performed really well in testing and won many games. This deck always wants to go first because using <a data-name=""Trickstar Reincarnation"">Trickstar Reincarnation</a> twice or even once hurts your opponent badly, making them lose a lot of their resources, especially in decks that play a lot of one ofs like Altergeist and Gouki. Altergeist has a major problem with resources because if they lose their altergeist monsters, especially specific ones like <a data-name=""Altergeist Silquitous"">Altergeist Silquitous</a> or <a data-name=""Altergeist Kunquery"">Altergeist Kunquery</a>, then they will lose since they won't have any way to interrupt you. If Goukis lose <a data-name=""Gouki Headbatt"">Gouki Headbatt</a> or <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a>, it can be pretty bad, depending on how many extenders they draw will determine if they can play without the Headbatt and or Iblee or not. Also burn damage will really kill your opponent when you have 2 or 3 <a data-name=""Trickstar Lycoris"">Trickstar Lycoris</a> combined with <a data-name=""Trickstar Lightstage"">Trickstar Lightstage</a>. Going first siding in <a data-name=""Dark Room of Nightmare"">Dark Room of Nightmare</a> can inflict some serious damage to your opponent with Lycoris and Reincarnation. I've also found that <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> works really well in this deck and stops most decks from going off since decks like Altergeist have all different attributes. Enjoy the deck!"

Burning Abyss OTK 2018 (Going Second) (Post Soul Fusion),"After working with the new Dangers from Soul Fusion, and new Soul Fusion cards in general, this is what I have come up with for Danger! Burning Abyss Chaos Go Second OTK from scratch (as always :)). This deck is really good going second, the new Chaos Dragon, <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> is broke along with Black Luster Soldier and <a data-name=""Orbital Hydralander"">Orbital Hydralander</a>. Orbital Hydralander is so good with Dante because after milling with Dante's effect you will most likely have 5 or more monsters in the grave and can special summon Hydralander. Basically all the monsters in this deck are one ofs so it's almost impossible to mill multiple copies of a monster, meaning you can use Hydralander without having to worry about getting off its effect. I've encountered many games where I can get one of the chaos monsters, plus Dante, plus one or two Hydralander(s) and my opponent just scoops at that point haha. This deck always wants to go second to utilize <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> and <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> to the best of their abilities and making your opponent lose all their resources. I got tired of playing Danger Darkworld ftk so I put in <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> in the side deck. It stops the ftk solid. Also <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> are really good to stop <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a>. If you think you will be forced to go first, siding in <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> and the one <a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a> will make your opponent quit because sitting on Vanity's means they cannot special summon and you will be able to poke them constantly without them being able to do anything. Sauravis protects Vanity's from target cards like <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a>. Enjoy the deck and as always stay tuned for more great decks!"

Let's go over the card choices in small groups. <h1>The Cards</h1> <h2>The Core</h2> <a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror</a>, <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> and <a data-name=""Orcust Brass Bombard"">Orcust Brass Bombard</a> are the heart of the deck, their effects in the GY are the engine. Harp Horror is clearly the main playmaker you're aiming to get the GY ASAP, but Cymbal Skeleton has more value on your opponent's turn where you can revive the Link monsters in a pinch. Brass Bombard is obviously not always as useful, as it requires you to have drawn into another Orcust monster, which can be a tall order when the archetype currently has so few names, but for that same reason we need as many as we can get so we still run 3. <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Wand&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Wand""</a><a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Wand&quot; ""> </a> is related, but doesn't have the advantage of being summoned by the Orcusts nor becoming a Quick Effect from Babel. It's mostly useful if you need to extend your plays some more after using your other resources.  <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>, <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> and <a data-name=""Scrap Recycler"">Scrap Recycler</a> all serve the same purpose - without any other sort of engine, the only way we make plays is with our Orcusts in the GY, so we <em>need</em> to achieve that as soon and as much as possible. With an added <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a> to make 10, <a>yugioh.party</a>'s hypergeometric magic tells us we have a 78% chance, which is acceptable considering the deck has multiple draw cards. Armageddon Knight is obviously the most versatile, as the other two can't send ""World Wand"", but most often you'll just be sending Harp Horror.  The Orcustrated Spells are what push Orcust from a cute little engine into a playable deck. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Return"">Orcustrated Return</a> is a classic ""plus zero"" draw card, similar to <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>, with the added benefit that almost anything you send will have an effect once it's in the GY. Later in the game when your hand is empty, you can send a Link monster and just revive it with Cymbal Skeleton. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Einsatz"">Orcustrated Einsatz</a> allows you to prepare resources for disruption on your opponent's turn after exhausting them all on your own, and why have I mentioned the opponent's turn so much when everything's an Ignition effect? Because <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> makes them Quick, just like that. Despite the fact these latter two cards are so important, we only play two copies each, because they're searchable and you can only use one of each at a time.  The Traps aren't quite as illustrious, but I'll explain them for completeness. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Core"">Orcustrated Core</a> gives you something to search when the rest is exhausted and a little bit of protection, as well as getting another card banished for the Link Monsters if you're really desperate. <a data-name=""Orcustrated Attack"">Orcustrated Attack</a> is just bad. <a data-name=""Karma Cut"">Karma Cut</a> has the same effect with a cheaper, generic cost and no activation condition. It's only in the Side Deck because it's half empty anyway and so you can see it.  Now, what's the end goal of all this? <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a> searches all your important cards like Babel and Einsatz, with a cost you practically <em>have</em> to have fulfilled before you summon it, which also recycles your resources for future use. <a data-name=""Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator"">Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator</a> is a nifty bit of spot removal, and the card effect immunity without having to ladder all the way up to Link 4 is important for a play we'll get into later. <a data-name=""Orcustrion"">Orcustrion</a>'s effect can be difficult to get the requirements for, but if your opponent has a big board of Link monsters it can be a total blowout.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> and <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> are pretty self-explanatory inclusions for a GY-focused deck like this, I would think. <h2>The Techs</h2> <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> has an impressive amount of synergy with Orcust for being a card associated with their Crusadia enemies. As a World Legacy monster, it can fuel the costs for Return and Core, and be summoned by ""World Wand"" - but you don't need to, as it's easy to have it summon itself to a zone which gives all the Orcust Links their protection, after which you can use it to Link ladder or leave it on board as a negation that's not trivial to run over.  <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> is nicer than usual in this particular deck, since the banished card can just be recurred with any of the Link effects. <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> is another card you can nullify the downsides of, as Longirsu and Orcustrion can be made immune, or in the worst-case scenario simply revived with Cymbal Skeleton. <a data-name=""Burial from a Different Dimension"">Burial from a Different Dimension</a> is a little bit ""whatever"", but sometimes you can banish faster than you shuffle back and you need some extra resources late in the game.  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> can salvage hands that brick into too many Orcust monsters, you simply Normal Summon Brass Bombard, link it away, then use its effect to summon Harp Horror (ideally) and continue into at least Longirsu from there. <a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">Wee Witch's Apprentice</a><a data-name=""Wee Witch's Apprentice"">,</a> <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> and <a data-name=""Decode Talker"">Decode Talker</a> are there just in case they come but, any tech monsters need to be DARK because of the restrictions on the Orcust monsters. Witch can at least help push for game depending on the board state and matchup. On the other hand, <a data-name=""Topologic Bomber Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> is a major player. Almost any deck that can Special Summon as a Quick Effect has some build that focuses on using Bomber during your opponent's turn, and as a purpose-built DARK Link deck with protected cards like Longirsu that you can summon and have stick around, Orcust is the best one for the job by far.  Note that while I didn't play any, Brass Bombard is a Tuner and you can theoretically make Synchro plays. 4 and 5 aren't great levels though, especially when you can only make DARK monsters. I guess if you really like <a data-name=""Underworld Fighter Balmung"">Underworld Fighter Balmung</a>? As all the Link Monsters only need one material to be from the archetype, Orcust can blend in well as an engine as a hybrid deck, as long as the other half is also DARK, but this deck is meant to demonstrate how they play pure. This deck can absolutely play monsters like <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, but this deck is adapted from real life and I can't even begin to afford that nonsense. <h2>The Side</h2> I don't like including a Side Deck in online deck profiles. The ""metagame"" online is an unpredictable, casual mess that rarely plays Match Duels anyway, and even if you take this build in real life, a casual deck shouldn't be expecting meta matchups, and you know your locals better than I do. Nevertheless, <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> is so cheap, so generic and so good that I can't imagine anyone not bothering, and <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> saves this Machine-type deck from the ever-present threat of <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> (remember when Cyber Dragon could only do that to certain decks?). I also recommend some Spell/Trap removal that doesn't require a summon, though which specific card is up to you. Attack is just there so you can see it. It's bad. Go away, Orcustrated Attack. <h1>The Plays</h1> Pretty much any ideal game will start like so: Normal Summon Armageddon Knight or an equivalent, and send Harp Horror, which will summon Cymbal Skeleton (or Brass Bombard if you have an Orcust in hand) and make Galatea. Your priority order for searching there is Babel &gt; Einsatz &gt; Return (if you have anything spare to send) &gt; Core. A much more underwhelming 1-card combo than Danger! Dark World FTK, but that deck doesn't play mr. skeltal so I think we're the real winners here. Any other way to Special Summon, like Brass Bombard or ""World Crown"" will get you to Longirsu, then Cymbal Skeleton can revive Galatea and make a Link 4.  Going first, the best bet is to go for Topologic Bomber Dragon for disruption. If you can get another Cymbal Skelton back in the GY through Einsatz, Burial from a Different Dimension, or recycling the same Skeleton with ""World Wand"", you can use Babel to summon Longirsu to its zone on the opponent's turn. Longirsu is linked (pointing to and/or being pointed at by any monster on the field), so it won't be destroyed by Bomber, and if you set your zones up right it can point at the free Extra Monster Zone to remove the survivor or any follow-up. The ideal zone setup here is Topologic in the right Extra Monster Zone, and Longirsu in the centre Main Monster Zone pointing at the left. On the other hand, if things are going poorly and you're stuck with Longirsu and Galatea, you want Longirsu in the left Extra Monster Zone so that you can put Galatea in the centre, pointing at the right and enabling their protection.  Bomber can still be useful going second depending on your opponent's board, but if they have no good monster to attack for burn, protection so that you can't blow things up, you have to play through disruption, or you simply opened Limiter Removal and want to go for a cheesy OTK, you might prefer Orcustrion as your Link 4 for protection, negation and synergy. In general Bomber's usefulness declines as a game goes on.  As previously mentioned, if you opened too many Orcust including Brass Bombard you can start with Linkuriboh as a backup strategy.  As far as success goes, Orcust is a very matchup-dependent deck. Losing Special Summons to <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"">Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</a>, effects to <a data-name=""Inspector Boarder"">Inspector Boarder</a> or GY access to <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> can leave you with very little counterplay (or play at all). As previously mentioned Cyber Dragon can also run roughshod over you as your entire deck is just Fusion Material for a giant Fortress Dragon. Meanwhile, if your opponent sets up a big board of Link Monsters like Cyberse (or maybe even Gumblar Gouki, though I haven't experienced the matchup myself), and you can get out Orcustrion, the game is practically over already. <h1>Conclusion</h1> Orcust have become one of my favourite decks since the moment they were released. Between their aesthetic (doot doot), their gameplay, and the new chapter in the World Legacy lore storyline, I love just about everything about them (except Attack). Hopefully this massive wall of text hasn't scared you off already and I've convinced some people to give it a go. Thanks for reading this far, and I hope you enjoy playing with Orcust."

It's another name to discard for Return or by banished for the Links, it helps you mill what you need, either to extend your own plays or to not need Einsatz in your opponent's turn, it's a target for <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> that gives us enough excuse to run it now, and while Mermaid being WATER is a bit tricky to work around the Knightmare name leads to a number of cool interactions.  <a data-name=""Orcustrated Release"">Orcustrated Release</a>... exists. I don't revile it like Attack, but not being minus one in card advantage requires a condition and Orcust doesn't really swarm with things you're happy to Tribute. I don't play it. <h2>The Techs</h2> As mentioned, <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> is now a great card in the deck. Besides Knightmare, it can target Brass Bombard or even ""World Wand"", though Knightmare is the best option. Speaking of her, <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a> can do some good work. If you summon Orcustrated Knightmare in your opponent's End Phase to avoid the restriction, you can summon Mermaid then Iblee or even another copy. Meanwhile, drawing into Iblee is far from the end of the world, Normal Summoning her and summoning Orcustrated Knightmare from the deck is as good of a play-starter as Armageddon Knight, to the point where it might be worth experimenting with multiple copies.  The only reason I didn't run <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> in the Soul Fusion deck was budget, and since this deck is currently for a future/imaginary format anyway I don't care as much. Level 8 is much better than 4 or 5 for DARK Synchros, and <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> comes out at just the right time. Equipping Orcustrion, Bomber Dragon or Longirsu gives you multiple negations and a fearsome attack value. Meanwhile, you have a lot of Level 7 monsters flying around after a good Machine Duplication, so you can play Rank 7 monsters like <a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a>. <a data-name=""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"">Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</a>, besides just being a card I really like is an option going first - the DARK restriction bars us from classics like <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a>, but in real life where Number 89 is a prize card you might want to replace it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon</a> or just not bother. <h2>The Removals</h2> With more monsters to work with, we don't need ""World Crown"" any more, though it's still a nice card you might want to try playing if you want to build things slightly differently. We also don't need as much mill (at least, not as much as we do need more space), and I cut Mathematician - there's not much difference between it and Scrap Recycler. I also cut one Babel for space, since in addition to being searchable it can also recur itself. It might be worth siding a spare copy against Cosmic Cyclone, though. <h1>The Plays</h1> All the options introduced by Knightmare make the deck a lot less linear than the Soul Fusion gameplan, and when I play the deck at the moment I mostly just wing it as I go. I don't have a solid combo to describe in detail for you this time. The Armageddon Knight starter should now probably summon Knightmare from Harp Horror, then send your next stage. When starting with Iblee, you'd send Harp Horror off the Knightmare used as Link Material. In either case, if you have Machine Duplication you can use it on Knightmare and get enough resources to do almost anything you want. <h1>Conclusion</h1> Orcustrated Knightmare is a beautiful example of how one card of support can completely revolutionise a deck. For the lore alone I was enamoured with it from the moment its art was leaked, and by the time the effect was translated it easily became one of my favourite cards of all time, even being my Discord Avatar for the Halloween season. The Orcust deck is now an absolute blast to play, and I can't wait for Savage Strike to release in the TCG so I can try the deck at locals. Thanks for reading."

General combo is to make a Tomahawk using level 7 Kaijus, Ascended of Thunder/Dino, or Burei. Use eff and Link into Qliphort Genius (in the Extra Zone not in front of enemy Kaiju). Synchro Token and tuners into Burei/Bureidos; making Nishipachi at the end and draw 2. Link token and Genius into Summon Sorceress (in zone in front of enemy Kaiju). If the Kaiju is Thunder King or Dogoran, Sorceress can pull Ascended Thunder and Dinowrestler Pankratops (respectively) in addition to the same Kaiju. You'll want to make a combo of True King of All Calamities + Hope Harbinger / Dracossack, or all three if the hand is good enough.  If they have no defenses, sometimes you can just FTK with Vermillion, Thunder King and Junk Giant, using Vermillion to pop the Kaiju you gave them, and swing for 8000.  Unfortunately, the Extra Deck space is so tight, there's no room for Black Rose Dragon, Big Eye, Divine Felgrand etc.  Tips:  -Go second even if you win dice roll. Preferrably you lose dice roll so they pick first without knowing you prefer going second, if the Kaiju deck doesn't make it obvious to them.  -Even if you are using Radian to make a Tomahawk which will fill your board with Tokens, if you can use his eff, summon a Radian Token because it will count as a separate name for Saryuja.  -Put Qliphort Genius on the zone away from Kaiju so you can use it's both it's Link arrows, then Link it with Summon Sorceress in front of Kaiju to maximize usage of the Link arrows.  -Remember, enemies can use the Quick Effect Kaijus if you have Kyoutou Waterfront so either avoid giving them that Kaiju or manage your plays around it."

I have a deck profile for you! After talking to my friend Demyx for some time who has been playing Phantom Knights for a long time and is really good with the deck, he has shared with me his Phantom Knights deck. Demyx has recently won the Davinator1212 $100 Budget Tournament for 2018 with his budget Phantom Knights build! This is not the budget build he won with, but rather his full best build. This deck is very persistent. It does not care about losing resources from the hand or field because it can recover very quickly by using the Phantom Knight's card's effects in the graveyard. All the Phantom Knight cards have some kind of graveyard effect that they can banish themselves to search or special summon a Phantom Knight from your grave. The trap cards can be banished from grave to special summon a Phantom Knight monster in grave to the field. The Phantom Knight monsters say that they can banish themselves to search a Phantom Knight card or Phantom Knight spell or trap. <a data-name=""Burial from a Different Dimension"">Burial from a Different Dimension</a> is extremely effective in this deck because it can bring back up to 3 banished cards to the graveyard meaning you get to search or special summon 3 more times! That is insane. Also the new Phantom Knight link monster, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a> is really good because it can send a Phantom Knight monster from the deck to graveyard to set a Phantom Knight spell or trap directly from the deck to the field! That's really good because then not only do you get a free Phantom Knight spell or trap to use of your choice but you can search another Phantom Knight card from the deck by banishing the monster you sent off Rusty Bardiche. Congratulations to my friend who won the tournament and I really hope you guys like his deck. Also stick around because in 2 to 5 days I will post some really awesome decks I have been working on and am really excited to share with you guys!"

Most people looking into this deck should probably already know what the deck tries to do, and most things in this deck are pretty standard outside of a few things. Which I will go into why they're being played now.  Unending nightmare is a nifty little way to get rid of opposing back row while also being a trap so you can chain your own paleos to it, and since it's once per chain meaning you could use it multiple times per turn if you're able to take out a whole lot of back row. Although it's only useful on decks that use spells and traps that stay face up on the field, such as flood gates so I limit it to one copy and keep it in the side. It can also be swapped out for a Solem judgement of one so desires.  Lilith can tribute itself on normal summon to reveal three normal traps and your opponent chooses to set one to the field. This is obviously good as all your paleos are normal traps and since you want all your paleos set to the field at one point or another no matter what your opponent picks is good for you.  and Paleozoic Marrella and Pikaia are played as they're both able to send a paleo to the grave for set up. Marrella has the bonus that it can send from the deck and isn't just limited to paleos, and pikaia says draw two on it do of course you gotta play two.  also Marrella has a cute face and looks like a nice guy so of worse comes to worse he's great moral support for the player."

This deck is insane (in a good way). After spending about a week crafting and play testing this deck from scratch this is what I have come up with. The ultimate goal of this deck is to just completely lock your opponent out of their monsters and plays. The Trickstar monsters do not care if they surrounded with floodgates because <a data-name=""Trickstar Candina"">Trickstar Candina</a> has a base attack of 1800 which is really good and will be hard for your opponent to get over. And even if they are somehow able to, that's why the deck plays <a data-name=""Honest"">Honest</a>. I've been playing around with 2 and 3 Honest and I like 2 better than 3 because I always see it when I don't need to. <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a>, <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, and <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a> just completely annihilates your opponent's monster board. This deck always wants to go first because setting the floodgates on the first turn is crucial to stop your opponent from playing on their first turn. Also, since the <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> <a data-name=""Trickstar Reincarnation"">Trickstar Reincarnation</a> combo is still a thing, I have added 3 Droll and 3 Reincarnation. It works out very well and every time I've play tested I've opened with either floodgates or the Droll Reincarnation plus searching one off Candina which means double Reincarnation so you can do the combo at their first Standby Phase. A tech I really love using is <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a>, all you need is the Candina search and even if you don't get it because you get ashed you can use Duality to dig and get to either a floodgate or another Reincarnation which is really helpful. Don't worry about using <a data-name=""Trickstar Lycoris"">Trickstar Lycoris</a> because you can use her on your opponents Draw Phase or Standby Phase. The 400 damage isn't really worth sweating over, it's better to get a floodgate or Droll Reincarnate your opponent than deal 400 to 1200 damage on your opponents first draw. Now this may sound crazy but <a data-name=""Soul Drain"">Soul Drain</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> in this deck is crazy good. Soul Drain just completely stops your opponent from doing anything in their graveyard with monster effects. Skill Drain on the other hand, does nothing to you because if you want to normal summon Candina you just have to use a Lycoris in hand to bounce the Candina back and then you still get to search while your opponent is just sitting there suffering from the effects of Skill Drain. I also really like <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> because it can stop your opponent from link summoning or summoning any kind of extra deck monster. It also allows your Candina or Lycoris to get over any monster that has a big attack. Now the thing you guys will also really like is the extra deck. The level 3 xyz <a data-name=""Mechquipped Angineer"">Mechquipped Angineer</a> is such a staple for Trickstars because you can go into it  with double Lycoris while your under Gozen Match, Rivalry of Warlords, or both since it is a light monster and a Fairy type! Same with <a data-name=""Fairy Cheer Girl"">Fairy Cheer Girl</a> except she is used with double Candina or Honest since she is a rank 4! It's effect says you draw 1 card for free which is awesome. Most of the side deck is for going second which your opponent will most likely force you to do if you win game 1 since they know you are running floodgates. I'm really tired of the Danger Darkworld FTK so therefore I put in Ghost Reaper and Ghost Ogre because it is really good to kill off <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> and prevent them from doing the FTK. Also, I have said this before but <a data-name=""Mind Control"">Mind Control</a> really hurts Sky Strikers. Taking their Kagari or Shizuku and linking it away means they don't get to use Raye's effect from grave to special summon herself. I really hope you guys enjoy this deck because I put a lot of effort into making it and play testing! Stick around for more :)."

It's basically pure Madolche with a LOT of stupid garbage tech cards. I'm going to go one by one with every stupid card I filled my deck with.  <strong>Main Deck</strong>  Puddingcess at 1: Basically just a combo piece for Puddingcessour, or maybe a early game combo with Mewfuille if both are drawn. However, tributes get really bricky really fast in this deck, so running more than 1 is not recommended.  Chouxvalier at 2: He's suitable battle protection for lower level monsters, and has a decent body. Also Rank 4 plays are really nice.  Messengelato at 3: Jesus in card form. If you have Hootcake or Mewfuille on the field, he farts out the field spell, Ticket, or Palooza for free. Really nice. Also rank 4 plays.  Butlerusk at 1: He's Madolche Terraforming. Chateau is so good that it's totally worth sacrificing a normal summon. Also, R A N K  4  Puddingcessour at 3: This. Fucking. Card. Its so good. Your grave should never have anything in it, so it's two free monsters with its effect, one of them being freely searched from the deck. If you want a spell, Hootcake. If you want Tiaramisu, or Dreadnaught Dreadnoid, or Chocolat-A-La-Mode, you have a Puddingcess. There are other options I'm sure, but these are what I've done so far. This is the best thing in this deck and running any less than 3 is a stupid idiot decision. I would run 5 if I could.  Mageiline at 3: Its free searching at the cost of a normal summon. Run 3.  Anjelly at 3: Its free searching and summoning at the cost of a tribute. Run 3.  Hootcake at 2: Anjelly but it banishes stuff. Also beast-type, so combos with Messengelato. I only run 2 because its kinda cloggy for the early duel.  Mewfuille at 1: It's a slower Puddingcessour. There are more in the extra deck if you want more, and it does combo with Messengelato, but it's not a favorite of mine.  Ash Blossom at 2: Hand traps. That is all.  Fang of Critias: Now, this is the moment you start questioning my sobriety, sanity and/or what profile you're reading. ""Why is there a random dragon support card in here?"" I hear you cry. Well, its a free unga-bunga beater with Mirror Force, and there are 3 Mirror Forces here.  Raigeki: Field nuke. Useful for opening up the board and I like me some nukes.  Desires at 2: Plus 2. You may say there are a lot of 1 ofs in the deck. Well, that's why there's only 2. Just don't use it before you get the field spell up because you really want it.  Double Summon at 3: Basically I run this because I'm stupid and don't understand Brilliant Fusion. I assume it works as well, but then you might have to remove tech cards and that's the point of this deck.  Terraforming at 1: Basically Butlerusk but it's backrow. You could swap one for the other depending on what you like.  Madolche Ticket at 2: This card is a win more card. If you have Tiaramisu on the field and this on the field, you basically played Exodia and won. GG. But it's dead in the hand if you don't have the tools to play it.  Chateau at 3: I run 3 of these, yet I never find it in my hand when I draw. Always have to search it. It's an amazing boost and great recovery from a sweep. I could run half my deck with this card. I love it so much. See, Konami. This is a man's field spell. Not this Neo Space, Kyoto Waterfront looking asses. This is peak preformance.  Evenly Matched at 2: It's new age early game Mirror Force. Why it isn't limited, I am unaware. But if you bricked and have this, it doesn't let anyone have fun.  Madolchepalooza at 1: It's a somewhat useful protection on Battle Phase, and you can just fart out just all the monsters any time.  Mirror Force at 3: I love this card so much, so f*ck you I run 3.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Mirror Force Dragon at 1: I like him. He's Mirror Force, but a monster. Chouxvalier + Mirror Force Dragon works surprisingly well as a consistent nuke if this thing hits the field. You could run 2, but I don't  Number 27: Dreadnaught Dreadnoid at 2, Super Dreadnaught Railcannon Gustav MAX at 1, and Number 81: Super Dreadnaught Railcannon Superior Dora at 1: I know, this extra deck looks funky to you so far. But trust me, the Rank 4 boat works as a tech. If you don't have Chateau up, farting out a boat instead of Tiaramisu is more optimal, due to equal ATK and the ability to get a Superior Dora or Gustav MAX out soon after, depending on what you like. I personally like Gustav but both have come in clutch. Sometimes, having 2 cute anime dolls fuse into a boat instead of the physical embodiment of smug is more optimal.  Queen Tiaramisu at 3: The physical embodiment of smug. She has multiple non-target, non-destruction removal, twice per life. She doesn't have the signature Madolche mill effect, but she shouldn't be dying so who cares.  Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode at 1: She's an option if you want more attack on Tiaramisu, and thats it really. Her effects are good but I like Tiaramisu more. You can run more if you like.  Firewall Dragon at 1: It's the best Link and I'm a meta sheep so yeah. It's good. Trust me.  Knightmare Phoenix at 2: It's like Tiaramisu but a easier. Easier to summon, easier to interrupt, and easier to play around. Useful quite often.  Knightmare Unicorn at 2: Honestly its like Phoenix but more. More complex, more effects. Just, more. Run more by preference.  <strong>Side Deck (AKA, the t e c h)</strong>  Winged Dragon of Ra: Sphere Mode at 2 and Winged Dragon of Ra at 2: Sphere Mode is like a Kaiju but more funny because it can fart out a Ra on your side soon after. I run it in matchups where I just can't get advantage.  Mewfuille at 2: If I want more swarming, I replace Desires with Cats. This card is good, but kinda bland imo. Run it all you want.  Ash Blossom at 1: See above about Ash Blossom.  Pot of Benevolence at 1: It's a plus sometimes. Also you can be nice and help your opponent win if you're losing and bricking super hard. Overall just a positive vibe.  Dark Hole at 1: It's Evenly Matched but old and for everyone. If I can't have fun, no one can.  Burial from a Different Dimension at 1: A tech card with Hookcake. It's a lot more viable and useful then you think.  Madolche Lesson at 1: It can do stuff. It's just kinda bricky. If you are confident in your Mewfuille/Messengelato combo, then run it if you wanna win more.  Floodgate Trap Hole: Wow there's a lot of stun cards. It's almost like this guy plays Altergeists too. What the heck? Yeah this card it funny because it basically just makes a card take up space, completely unusable.  Solemn Strike at 2: Wow more stun. Strike is always good, but the Solemns are all preference. Unless you play Wish. Then you and I need to negotiate a restraining order.  &nbsp;  Playstyle:  There isn't necessarily one. It's more of a mindset. A mindset that requires a lot of sleep deprivation and/or alcohol to understand. It's a simple idea. You win. But how? It's all up to you, and the cards. Between Tiaramisu, Chocolat-A-La-Mode, the Dreadnaughts, MFD, and all those links, you have a lot of power. With Mirror Force, Solemn Strike, Ash Blossom, etc, you have a lot of removal and stun. With Mageline, Messengelato, Puddingcessour, Anjelly, etc... you have a lot of consistency. It's a versatile deck, and the perfect drunk deck. You can play it how you want, and you're still not wrong! Stylish, safe, stupid. It's like Captain Falcon in Smash Bros. (Note: I have obviously only played this on simulator. I have no idea how it works irl.)  Moral of the story? Release Puddingcessour in the US please I wanna say I play a tier 1 deck."

I also included 3x <strong>Orcustrated Einsatz</strong> for a better chance of having it or <strong>Orcustrated Babel</strong> on the hand/field as important playmaker. 2x <strong>Mystical Space Typhoon</strong> to replace <strong>Twin-Twisters. </strong>No hand traps but 2x <strong>Called by the Grave</strong> instead.  <strong>Orcustrated Return</strong> would be a better choice to replace <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong> but this is a budget variant so...  The Extra Deck consists of the typical Orcust Lineup as well as Support cards which help to overcome or negate card effects of your opponent. The most expensive card here would be <strong>Topologic Bomber Dragon</strong> which can your opponents Monster Board in his turn.  In the Side Deck is the Cardtrooper Engine an extra <strong>Brass Bombard</strong> if you want to have extra <strong>Machine Dup.</strong> targets as well as the new Orcust Cards that appear in Savage Strike.

To do this you need to get <strong>Zombie World</strong> on the field (usually through <strong>Necroworld Banshee</strong>) and send <strong>Glow-Up Bloom</strong> to the grave.  This will summon <strong>Doomking Balerdroch</strong> to your field, and you should be able to make <strong>zombie sucker</strong> with another zombie on the field. When <strong>Doomking Balerdroch</strong> gets summoned back to your field on the next turn you get an additional draw and can already banish something if necessary.  Aside from this the deck is great and busting out synchros. You will often make <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong>, and with another monster or <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> you can make any of your synchros. Don't forget that <strong>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</strong> gets bonus attack for each zombie on the field and in the graveyard and <strong>Zombie World</strong> makes all monsters on the field and the grave zombies, making his attack go very high!  Additionally, the deck runs staples like <strong>Called By The Grave</strong>, <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>, <strong>Soul Charge</strong>, <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> and <strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops</strong> (to take out any floodgate spells/traps).

Swarm with Cyber Dragons and recycle monsters extremely easily.,"Depending on your starting hand, you have many different options with this deck. I currently use it and find it extremely fun and good at recycling all my monsters.  If you start with an Orcust monster in your hand, it's time to start building up to get all your Orcust Links out. Harp Horror allows you to special summon Cymbal Skeleton from the deck by banishing from the graveyard, and then if you summon another machine monster, you can get out Galatea, who will then allow you to send Harp Horror back to the deck to get a free Orcust spell (and I always choose Babel, which allows you to use the effects of any Orcust monster as a quick effect). If you can get Einsatz onto the field as well, even better, as this will allow you to build your graveyard or banish zone with Orcust monsters when your opponent summons a monster, allowing you to use each of their effects to help build up towards Orcustrion, and building upto Orcustrion and linking it is extremely easy as you can use Cybmal Skeleton to special summon another Orcust Link you used to build up to Orcustrion back, and have them pointing at each other, protecting them. And if you get Orcustrated Core out as well, you're able to refill your banished monsters easily from the graveyard, allowing you to be able to use the Orcust Link monster's effects when needed, and as a added bonus, Longirus and Orcustrion's effects affect any opponent's linked monsters, not just ones your Links are pointing to, making your opponent's own Links dangerous.  If you start with Cyber Dragons in your hand, you want to focus on getting Cyber Network out to banish Cyber Dragons for later, which is easier to get if you have Cyber Dragon Core as it allows you to get a Cyber spell/trap from your deck to your hand if normal summoned. You can even use Orcustrated Core to banish more of you Cyber Dragons so that when Cyber Network is destroyed, even if it's destroyed early, you can special summon ANY banished Light Machine monster, not just the ones sent by Cyber Network's effect. Your aim to to build up to Cyber Dragon Sieger as his effect will cover the majority of this deck's boss monsters, allowing you to add 2100 ATK and DEF to any machine monster with 2100+ ATK as long as you haven't attack with it yet, and making you (and your opponent) take no damage from attacks involving Sieger. You also want to try and summon out your Cyber Dragon Infinity as this will allow you to attach attack position monsters to it once per turn, and that includes your opponent's monsters, allowing you to clear their board, and if they try to negate/destroy Infinity, you're able to use his other effect (once per turn) to negate a card/effect and destroy it by removing 1 material, and if you're building up his material each turn, he becomes a big nuisance for your opponent.  The other cards in this deck are built around trying to recycle cards or fill your graveyard so you can utilize Orcustrated Core as your Orcust Link monsters are gonna be recycling all your monsters, so you don't need to worry much about losing your Extra Deck monsters. All your other Cyber Dragons are used for linking/fusing/XYZ, and with a few different ways to do this (such as Cyberload Fusion allowing you to use your banished monsters as materials). Swift Scarecrow was put in as a way to help stall if you've been unlucky enough to not pull any Orcust/Cyber Dragons, and because it's a Machine monster, you're able to put him back into the deck using Orcusts, or are able to use him for linking or fusing.  If you get a mixture, I personally start out with Orcust as I feel that you rely on them a bit more.  If you can get DNA Surgery out, you can turn all your opponent's monsters into Machine types too allowing you to clear their board with Chimeratech Fortress Dragon, or using Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon to clear out your opponent's monster in the Extra Zone. You do need to have a Cyber Dragon on the field to do this, but thanks to all their effects, every variation of Cyber Dragon in this deck is treated as Cyber Dragon when on the field/graveyard. And Machine Duplication is great for either side, as if you use it on Cyber Dragon Core, you get to special summon your 2 Cyber Dragons as its' name becomes Cyber Dragon, and if you use it on Orcust Brass Bombard, you have your material for Galatea immediately.  d iI also added in 2 Transmigration Prophecy so you can recycle some spell and traps too. As for Cyber Eternity Dragon, Chimeratech Overdragon and Cyber Twin Dragon, they're more ways to utilize your fusion cards and big hitters/defenders to help stall for longer if needed. Also added in a Soul Absorption to maximize on the constant banishing, and reasoning as it's fine to have cards go to the graveyard to search out another monster."

The fact that she is a normal monster means she can come in usage in places her sisters can not. You can use <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> to special summon her from the hand. (Use <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> on <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a>'s token). She is a necessity to use <a data-name=""Draco Masters of the Tenyi"">Draco Masters of the Tenyi</a>'s effect (more below). Tho I'd love a new alternative artwork. ^^'</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Pet Dragon"">Harpie's Pet Dragon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Harpie's Pet Dragon&quot;&gt;Harpie's Pet Dragon&lt;/a&gt; - Fearsome Fire Blast""> - Fearsome Fire Blast</a> - The newest release from Konami. Lovely card, much needed for the reliability of the deck. Also a level 7 dragon to pair with <a data-name=""Harpie Channeler"">Harpie Channeler</a>. Can be searched with <a data-name=""Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms"">Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms</a> and <a data-name=""Hysteric Sign"">Hysteric Sign</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a> - Oh boy do they hate this card. It's easily accessible in this deck. Cards that can search it are <a data-name=""Harpie Harpist"">Harpie Harpist</a> and <a data-name=""Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms"">Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms</a>. Cards that can special summon it are <a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>, <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon"">Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon</a>,<a data-name=""Swallow's Nest""> Swallow's Nest</a>. Also <a data-name=""Harpie Dancer"">Harpie Dancer</a> can bounce a card so you can normal summon it from the hand.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Wing Requital"">Wing Requital</a> - <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a> for harpies. Extremely important. Use it before bringing out your dragons/extra deck monsters.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> - odd card for such a deck that can recycle it's resources as easily, but it's very useful in the newest version. Main targets are <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>, a monster you threw in the GY with <a data-name=""Harpie's Pet Dragon - Fearsome Fire Blast"">Harpie's Pet Dragon - Fearsome Fire Blast</a>'s effect or any other card that can extend your plays.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> - Self explanatory. Can be searched by <a data-name=""Hysteric Sign"">Hysteric Sign</a> or <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Swallow's Nest"">Swallow's Nest</a> - Sadly i removed our ''secret weapon'' called <a data-name=""Inferno Reckless Summon"">Inferno Reckless Summon</a> but it was necessary. It's not reliable in the current meta.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Slash Harpie Lady"">Cyber Slash Harpie Lady</a> - Amazing card. Great effect with non target removal, also it's a level 5+ Harpie card (can help boosting <a data-name=""Harpie Perfumer"">Harpie Perfumer</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie Oracle"">Harpie Oracle</a> and <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Rest"">Harpie's Feather Rest</a>'s power).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Draco Masters of the Tenyi"">Draco Masters of the Tenyi</a> - Use it in desperate situations. It requires having normal monsters in your GY (your Harpie Lady).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a> - When you summon him use his effect at the end of your turn to bring out  your barrier statue. Use his effect again at the opponent's next turn for extended plays (If he survives).</li> </ol> Decided to come back and update the deck because of the latest releases from Konami.

It is a control deck that aims to gain enormous card advantage over the opponent to overwhelm and take over the game state.Going first it usually sets up 1-2 negates with recovery options ready for the next turn,and going second it is capable of breaking boards with their Maneuvers and Widow Anchors. My version is the pure build,without combo cards like Scapegoat and Phantom Skyblaster. <strong>The Deck</strong>:- <strong>Starters,the deck's main play initiators,that require next to none,or no set up to play</strong>(15): 3x Sky Striker Ace - Raye A crucial component of the deck,and the only normal summon in my build.She allows for instant access into any Sky Striker monster.The recovery effect also comes up often.The combo variant can get away with playing 2,but in the pure version you want 3.Losing a copy of Raye (banishing effects,etc) can be quite detrimental early on,especially in the mirror,and getting the next one in your GY is quite important. 2x Foolish Burial Goods Dumps Metalfoes Fusion to the GY,and really helps Engage-less hands by sending Engage to the GY,caving the path for a follow-up Kagari to grab that Engage.3 clogs,1 doesnt come up as often as you'd want. 3x Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage! Without doubt the heart and soul of the deck.The deck revolves around repeatedly activating Engage to gain advantage. Being able to search any Sky Striker card is just too powerful to pass up on,and the draw 1 becomes really prominent late game. No less than 3,no exceptions(unless you can't afford the 3rd copy). 1x Reinforcement of the Army Turbos out Raye from the deck. 1x Foolish Burial Dumps Darkest Diabolos(see Darkest Diabolos,Lord of the Lair under ""Extenders""). 1x Hornet Drones It became limited because of how generic the token-summoning effect was.You normally want to grab this only after you already have a Raye in your GY,for the recursion safety. 2x Terraforming Turbos out Area Zero (see Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero). 2x Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero Lets you potentially remove cards from your Main Monster Zone, make use of a drawn Metalfoes Fusion while gaining some advantage.You can pop it with Afterburners or Twin Twisters when you side it in (more on TwTw ahead) to get out a Raye from your deck as well. <strong>Extenders,cards that require set up and are normally follow-up plays from starters</strong>(6): 1x Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair The main usage of this card is its effect to reduce your opponent's starting hand by 1. Besides that,he is a 3000 ATK Body that is untargetable,proving invaluable against the mirror and Altergeist matchups. You want to get him in your GY early on so that he acts like another Raye to put the pressure on your opponent. 1x Monster Reborn Free revival is always welcome. 1x Soul Charge The bomb card you dont want to use unless you're going for game via something like Topologic Trisbaena or go into some control cards like Borreload or Ningirsu. 2x Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole Generates immense advantage for the deck by allowing recycling of the Sky Striker spells. 3 is largely unneccesary, and 1 would be too fragile to disruption. 1x Sky Striker Mecharmory - Hercules Base You don't want to see this card early on, and really only need 1 for the recycling effect, mainly to be used on your Sky Striker Extra Deck monsters.To be sent off of multirole or area zero to trigger its effect.  <strong>Defense,cards used to disrupt the opponent's plays</strong>(12): 3x Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit. This slot can be used on any handtrap of preference,but other handtraps like Ash are currently not very strong versus the meta. 3x Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor Searchable negate. Stops your opponent's plays and the control effect is what you want to save the anchor for,so that they are left with less resources to make their plays. In the mirror, this can be chained to an opponent's anchor so they cant take control of it. 3x Infinite Impermaneance Flexible card that works going first or second. Going first you'd want to set it in the middle zone so that it can negate an opponent's Spell/Trap card,and going second you can set this in the same zone as a way to block off a backrow piece. 3x Solemn Strike Impermaneance as a slower,but counter trap version,meaning the opponent can only respond to it with other counter trap cards. The 1500 LP cost isn't significant, but if you're going into time I'd side it out.  Re-raisers,cards that stop an effect or action that would hamper your plays(3): 2x Called by the Grave Because we can only run 2 now.Generic handtrap disruption is great,and if they dont have a handtrap you can always just set it as a means of disruption during your opponent's turn. This application is more prominent in the mirror, to banish their Raye. 1x Sky Striker Mecha - Eagle Booster Avoid negation or stall out a game so you can Hayate or something. No more than 1 is really needed, it is easily accessible and floatible via multirole.  Placeholders,consistency cards(2): 1x Upstart Goblin Consistency,also it is another spell in your GY for Sky Striker effects. 1x Metalfoes Fusion Same as Upstart Goblin  <strong>Removal Cards,cards to pop threats</strong>(2): 1x Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners! Free pops. 1x Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves More versatile vs the Paleo or Altergeist matchup, its 2nd effect allows for non-targeting monster removal.  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>: 1x Linkuriboh Drones into this. Helps gather materials for a Borreload or Knightmare. 3x Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku A differently-wired Engage. You can use multirole to set a card from your GY that you want 2 of,then use this card's eff to get the 2nd copy.You go through Kagari and Shizuku rapidly through out a game 3x Sky Striker Ace - Kagari Extremely important. You run out of your Kagaris even faster than your Shizukus. Use in tandem with things like Goods or Hayate to grab any Sky Striker spell from your deck 1x Sky Striker Ace - Hayate Lets you deal damage more often, and adds to the versatility of the deck by fixing Engage-less hands going 2nd. You don't need more copies, besides you can recycle her with Hercules Base. 1x Knightmare Phoenix Out floodgates,because this deck loses to most floodgates. Rivalry,Gozen,Anti-Spell,Imperial Order,you name it.Make under a linkuriboh when link-climbing to get the draw 1. 1x Knightmare Unicorn A more costly,but stronger phoenix. Lets you out multiple type of cards as it can shuffle any type of card into the deck. 1x Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior Out non-targetable cards like Ultimate Falcon which can lose you the game versus decks like Altergeist and Paleozoic. Its summoning condition is fairly easy to pull of mid-game,which is when your going to want to make this most of the time. 1x Firewall Dragon Cherries target. 1x Borreload Dragon One of your best outing materials in the deck, pretty similar to Darkest Diabolos, but this card lets you break apart already established boards by taking control of cards and beating over anything with its effect to lower by 500 combined with its 3000 body. All-round a great card,but its not so effective in the mirror, namely because of Widow Anchor. 1x Black Rose Dragon Niche card just in here for the nuke effect,for late game in mind when you'd be losing. Get a Raye on board,then revive a Ghost Ogre in your GY via Monster Reborn or Soul Charge to synch for this and blow the board.A nice come-back card. 1xSuperbolt Thunder Dragon Cherries Target.  <strong>Side Deck</strong>: 3x Ghost Reaper and Winter Cherries Gouki and Danger World cant extra link or FTK you without their Firewall dragon. Thunder Dragons can get really hurt by this unless they have access to Thunder Dragon Fusion. Greatly reduces the stamina of Sky Striker decks in the mirror, with the added bonus that you may resolve it twice, banishing Kagari(higher priority) and then Shizuku (lower priority). A great side deck card for going 2nd in any deck that can afford the Extra Deck space. 3x Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast! Out Extra Link boards with this searchable spell. 3x Shared Ride Side this in going first to lower their plays significantly. Basically Maxx ""C"" as a spell. 3x Twin Twisters Because this deck loses to floodgates bad. Altergeist is currently a Tier 2 deck, so it will have a decent appearance at events. 3x Evenly Matches By far the best going 2nd card, works vs any deck. The only excuse you can have to not run this card is its price. I have screwed over many players by making them go 2nd Game 3 and siding this and other appropriate side deck cards in,because they'd side for going 2nd,when you're making them go first. It is a bit risky to pull this off,however it can easily win you the entire game quickly, especially when you are about to go into time.  <strong>End Thoughts</strong>:  Sky Striker is a control deck,hence why the low amount of extenders,and high amount of starters and defense cards. While the Pure Variant is, from my knowledge and experience, generally more predictable and easier to counter,it is more consistent and reliable in what it does compared to the Combo Variant that runs cards like Phantom Skyblaster and Scapegoat. I am personally still exploring the Combo Variant,and hope to write about that version in the future if possible!"

If your normal summon is negated, all a player can really do is pass turn at that point and more then likely lose. The addition of the brilliant fusion engine to the deck helps with that problem by having the potential to give the deck an extra normal summon to fall back on. It also provides two different typed monsters for folgo, (Being seraphinite and trick clown) letting you get into your boss monster fairly easily.  With fur hire's main gimmick being able to swarm the board, one can easily also go into any link monster one's hart desires for any situation. Such as borreload, or borrelsword dragon for OTKs, or the knightmares to out problem cards. There's also a small rank 4 engine in the extra deck for more niche situations.  Finally the side deck is geared almost souly for when you have to go second. The only card in the side deck that's not a going second card is cosmic cyclone. the side is build this way as, while two of the fur hire monsters can pop either a face up card or a face down when a fur hire monster is special summoned to the field, I feel fur hires do not do well going second so this side is made to mitigate that."

The Salamangreat cards give the deck a boost that it needs and makes it open to more combos. I dunno man it just works and is a blast to play! Enjoy and please leave input on improvements!  p.s. This will be the last revision I will make to this deck on the website but I basically took most of the salamangreat cards out and added more tech cards. I feel the deck is way more competitive now but sorry for changing it so much on day 1.

When I sold all of my old cards these cards were the ones I kept due to me never losing a game with them.  The cards that may be on a ban list are able to be subbed out for similar cards with similar effects that are still legal, I just do not own those cards that are able to be swapped out.  The side deck still requires more cards that would allow for you to be able to switch out the main dragon/strategy to make it similar to how you may play a dragon deck , this is just one deck I currently use and own."

Wovie is support I elected to have hiita over sunlight wolf the effect was more effective, and of course the fusion of fire cynet fusion is for violet chimera otk. raging flame sprite is clutch card in certain situations and can attack directly bypassing defense if you don't kill fast enough it can be a threat 1k every attack boost. I'm still on the fences about foxer I like its effect might try playing it take out 1 foxy see how it plays. Now around the time savage strike comes out the soul burner starter comes out as we all know so haven't done enough research on those salamangreats yet so that why they are not included."

I've just have been busy but I have been cooking up some cool decks for you guys and this is one of them. Just keep waiting and there will be many more made from scratch decks from me in the near future! I hope everyone had a really great Thanksgiving yesterday. The idea of Thunder Dragon Dinosaurs has been going around for a while now and I just haven't been paying attention so I decided to make my own version from scratch with the <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> combo I've made in some of the other decks I've released that uses <a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a> and <a data-name=""Glow-up Bulb"">Glow-up Bulb</a>. This deck wants to go first and I do admit it can brick sometimes. But I still like it because when it doesn't brick it can really go off! And it can play through some handtraps going first depending on what you draw and what their handtraps are. You can easily play through ash and ogre. Because you can draw into both the Thunder Dragon and Dinosaur engines and then your opponent will ash one of the engines like <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> but then you have the Thunder Dragon engine like <a data-name=""Thunder Dragondark"">Thunder Dragonhawk</a> and or the any of the other Thunder Dragon monsters to go into <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a>. Some games I am able to get out Nat Beast, a Colossus, a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a>, and an <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>. There's no way your opponent can beat that going second unless they main <a data-name=""Evenly Matched or Kaijus"">Evenly Matched or Kaijus</a>. There are other cards to counter it but you get the point, there aren't many and most people don't main them. I hope you guys enjoy this deck and stick around for more soon :)."

Well here you go! This deck may seem crazy at first but once you play it you'll soon realize how good this deck is. This is a special deck I've been working on for you guys for about a month now and it's a masterpeace (no pun intended) haha. After testing this from scratch I've combined all these archetypes and they function very well together. This deck is strictly good for going second, you want to go second whenever possible. Using <a data-name=""True King Agnimazud, The Vanisher"">True King Agnimazud, The Vanisher</a> to destroy the Fire King and or Infernoid monsters in hand makes it so you can use the Fire King's effects plus get an Infernoid in grave for a summon of another one and allows you to banish a monster on the field from Agnimazud's effect. The Mekk-Knight monsters help otk very quickly. Using <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> destroys your opponent when they commit all their resources on their first turn when they go first. You have so many options in your hand so you can bait out their negates and then use Evenly to get rid of all their resources and then on your next turn! The Invoked engine is also really good and is the normal summon condition of the deck since there are no other monsters to normal summon except <a data-name=""Fire King Avatar Arvata"">Fire King Avatar Arvata</a> which is the other normal summon of the deck, but you mainly want Aleister unless you're forced to go first. A cool combo I like to do is to special summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Blue Sky"">Mekk-Knight Blue Sky</a> and then get out one of the ghost girls and use them to go into <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>. Overall, this deck is really solid and can win against a lot of decks even meta decks. I've beaten Sky Striker multiple times using this deck because they can't handle all the monsters on board and get overwhelmed. I really hope you all enjoy and as always stick around for more!"

As of this moment, ""Double Header Anger Knuckle"" is not officially released yet so I temporarily include Qliphort Genius as their link monster (Earth Machine with some protection and Bottom Left/Bottom Right Arrow)  The main strategy this deck is simple, summon the big guys like Super Dora, Gustav Max, Liebe and just go ham on the opponent with their massive damage.  <strong>Main Deck Monsters</strong>  <em><strong>Derricrane</strong></em> is one of the best material to have to go for the OTK since it can destroy 1 opponent's card after being detached.  <em><strong>Ruffian</strong></em> is your quick Lvl10 monster search, I would advise not to use his burning effect since it will hinder your battle phase. You can use it if it's lethal tho :D  <em><strong>Buller Liner</strong></em> the newly added support card that can massively boost the consistency since it can be special summoned if all monsters you have are EARTH Machine monster (which is technically every monster in this deck except <strong>Metal Reflect Slime</strong> and <strong>Malefic Cyber End</strong> - and <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> is for hand use, if you have to use her on the field as the defense then you are in trouble already). It's level 10 for <strong>Urgent Schedule</strong> and the Xyz Summoning. The 3000 ATK can be used for <strong>Special Schedule. </strong>It also has a float recycling effect so this card is your main support card.  <strong><em>Pegasus</em> </strong> your one card Xyz (if you have any lvl 10 monsters in your GY). It can copy the level of that revived monster so Xyz is very very easy with this guy around. One simple way to have Lvl 10 in the graveyard is by chucking them to the GY via <strong>Switchyard</strong>  &nbsp;  This deck lack defense for the big guys (except Super Dora) so it's crucial that you clear up the board and make sure nothing stands in the way and that role belongs to the Spell and Trap.  &nbsp;  <strong>Spell/Trap:</strong>  The aim is to keep up the presence on the field with summoning cards like Special Schedule, Monster Reborn (optional), Urgent Schedule, Switchyard  Also, I added a few cards to clean up the opponent field before going for the full attack like  Twin Twister, Red Reboot, Mirror Force  &nbsp;  <strong>Side deck:</strong>  Contain mostly some situational cards that can alleviate some problems like banish, opponent card advantages  Evenly Matched can wipe out the whole board but one card left so you should have easy time OTK the opponent  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck</strong>  Loaded with Rank 10 Xyz monsters that can deal with a lot of scenarios.  <strong>Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer</strong> (what a mouthful and cool name) can clear the opponent's back row and enable you to get Liebe out for the big punch  <strong>Dyson Sphere </strong>is your main card to get rid of annoying cards like Beelze (one of your dreadful counter) or any monsters that cannot be destroyed by just attack damage  <strong>Juggernaut Liebe</strong> the biggest hitter I've seen in a while, this guy can attack monsters equal to its Material number +1 so with 3 materials (normal Xyz + the Xyz monsters itself used for Liebe's summoning) can give you 4 attacks. That's enough to wipe the board clean if the opponent spam summons and possibly and OTK if they leave their weaker monsters in attack positions. I love using this card to punish monsters that cannot be destroyed by battle in attack positions since I can keep hitting it.  <strong>Super Dora</strong> is your main guy to go for if you are unsure what the opponent is up to OR you know exactly what the opponent is up to :)) Its effect to let a card be unaffected by card effect is very handy, one cool way to use it on opponent monsters is if you know they have <strong>Honest</strong> on their hand or if they try to use <strong>Clashing Soul</strong> on you. <strong>Super Dora</strong> can shut down most offensive options your opponent tries to go since it also have a big body of 3200 ATK and 4000 DEF.  <strong>Gustav Max </strong>your one massive burner. 2000 effect damage makes you a glorified <strong>Gagaga Cowboy</strong>  One basic OTK is to summon Gustav with Derricrane and another rank 10 and detach 1 material to inflict 2000 damage (Esp. Derricrane if they have anything defending) then Rank up to Juggernaut Liebe and detach one material from Liebe to get the 6000 ATK to finish the opponent. Short and simple  Thanks for reading guys, I hope this deck can provide you some nice entertainment of wrecking the opponent's strong start that lack defense (most decks I see nowadays focus a lot on offense and lack defense so if they can't stop you from getting out Gustav Max and Liebe, you should have easy time winning the match)  Good luck and enjoy! Let me know how this deck works for you guys."

I present to you: a calculated approach to Trains! <em>Edit: that was, until Sky Strikers demonstrated to be good enough to be included too.

And try resummoning Bullet Liner and Ruffian Railcar as much as you can.  For the Extra Deck: if you're going second then replace the traps/Pots Of Desires with the Shaddoll set.  Always go first, unless up against an OTK deck. Yes, really. Sure, it can OTK too, but the sheer majority of your opponents would much rather you go second.  &nbsp;  &lt;!--more--&gt;  ...More detail? Alright, let's talk about some of the cards. <ul>  	<li>Going first might sound unintuitive, considering it's an OTK-capable deck, but there's a lot of plays you want to make going first. Letting the opponent have an extra card is worth it.</li>  	<li>Ruffian Railcar is definitely the weakest of the five trains. Still worth a one-of though. Just one.</li>  	<li>Sky Strikers, using Hayate, let you summon two Machine monsters with one card. Which lets you summon Anger Knuckle. That's a big deal.</li>  	<li>Adding more normal-summonable Earth Machines hardly changes the odds. Seriously, adding in <a data-name=""Swift Scarecrow"">Swift Scarecrow</a>, for example, only increases the Liebe odds by 0.5%.</li>  	<li>Don't hate me for Needlefiber &amp; Sorceress. They're just too good a combo in this deck to leave out. ...And yes, having exactly three non-Ash tuners <em>is</em> best for odds, apparently.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Blitzkrieg Bombardment"">Blitzkrieg Bombardment,</a> <a data-name=""All-Out Attacks"">All-Out Attacks, and Xyz Veil</a> would be pretty great... if I had any faith in them sticking around. But I don't.</li>  	<li>I used to use Pinpoint Landing, Imperial Order, and Turbo Booster, but they eventually got bullied out of the deck by better tech cards.</li>  	<li>No, Kaiju are not good enough.</li> </ul>"

A wyrm (pronounced worm or vurm) is a type of dragon that commonly appears in British and Norse mythology. These dragons have no legs or arms and only the long, scaled body of a serpent. They are often given poisonous breath and the ability to regenerate or reattach pieces of their body that have been cut off.  Wyrm-Type monsters resemble dragons, but unlike <a title=""Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon"">Dragon</a>-Type monsters, they take more of a spiritual, mythical, metaphysical look. Most of the initial Wyrm-Type monsters were part of the ""<a title=""Yang Zing"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Yang_Zing"">Yang Zing</a>"" archetype, which seems to be based on Chinese dragons and/or other animals within Chinese lore, such as tigers, resembling ""<a title=""Tiger Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Tiger_Dragon"">Tiger Dragon</a>"" and ""<a title=""Orient Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Orient_Dragon"">Orient Dragon</a>"" (which are both Dragons, however).

Tem como principal objetivo impedir as jogadas do seu oponente, neutralizando seus movimentos deixando seus monstros em posição de defesa com a face para baixo. O objetivo deste deck é trazer uma boa jogabilidade para o deck sem que perca sua originalidade. <strong>Metodologia:</strong> Esse Deck foi elaborado a partir de jogos experimentais, e de uma revisão de Decks e jogos adquiridos nas plataforma:  YGOPRODECK e YouTube. As palavras chaves utilizadas foram ""Baralho"" e ""Fantardil"" e suas correspondentes em inglês, ""Deck"" e ""Ghostrick"". Foram critérios de exclusão: Decks e jogos publicados antes de 2018 e os que se referiam à Decks que não utilizavam os monstros Ghostrick como ferramentas principais. Somando-se todas as bases de dados, foram encontrados 20 Decks. Após a observação de seus cards, notou-se que alguns deles se repetiram nas diferentes bases e outros não preenchiam os critérios deste estudo. Foram selecionados 5 Decks e excluídos os que não conseguiram utilizar-se combos após 5 partidas e finalizou-se com 3 decks mais a minha subjetividade. <strong>Resultados:</strong> O deck aponta que a utilização de XYZ é importante para o funcionamento do deck, porém é necessário trazer os LINKS por conta do novo META-GAME. O jogo é demorado e obedece a uma ordem constante; Mudar posição de batalha do inimigo, utilização de xyz e ataque direto. Foi visto que os jogos que menos se utilizaram xyz seguiram de derrotas. <strong>Conclusão:</strong> O  deck tem como principal objetivo o uso de XYZ para ter domínio sobre o oponente e obter um jogo mais rápido e eficaz."
