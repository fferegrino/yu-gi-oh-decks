I don't bother with meta so there aren't many meta cards you ussualy see in D/D/D decks such as Savage Dragon and Crystal Wing, but you can add them instead of some other monsters.  Use Swirl Slime and Necro Slime to summon D/D/D fusion monsters.  Ghost and Lamia are the main tuners from which one can revive itself and the other one send monsters to GY. Ghost is in my opinion the best way to summon Bright Armageddon.  Necrofear can return banished monsters to GY and easly destroy cards if you have face up spells or traps (good thing this deck uses a lot of pendulums, continues spells and traps).  Gates lets you search needed combo piece, Swamp King is a great fusion spell, Eternal Darkness protects from targeting and tributing (take that Kaiju!) and Witch is a combination of card destruction and ATK buff.  Combine effects of Genghis, Alexander and Ragnarok to revive monsters. D'Arc turns Dark Contract LP price into bonus LP. Siegfried is great for negating any face up spell or trap.  If you get the right set up you can easly summon all 3 Super Doom Kings without any problem"

Not only was Toon Black Luster Soldier a welcome addition to the deck, granting both removal AND the ability to attack directly on the same turn it's summoned (with the ability to be cheated out VERY easily, might I add) but Toon Bookmark and Page-Flip adds some much needed consistency to the deck as well. Toon Harpie Lady is a very nice bonus as well. Backrow removal is always welcome.  Now, I've always been the type of guy who likes to draw his cards pretty darn quickly, hence why you see a 42 card deck with Pot of Desires tossed in. You can tech a surprise Gren Maju De Eiza, or even a Necroface to recycle said cards back into the deck. But, if you aren't chill with that, you can swap the Desires for Extravagance, but be warned that I found the deck a lot more consistent with Desires.  Some of you may be wondering why I'm maining Raigeki/Harpie's Feather Duster instead of shovelling in 2 copies of Lighting Storm. In my experiments, while Lightning Storm is pretty nice on hand to have if you're lagging behind, it's rather limiting seeing as how you can't control anything face-up to use it. Best just to cut to the chase and use the actual cards with no drawbacks. However, I won't object to you swapping in two Lightning Storms.  By the way, just a heads up about Bookmark. If you use Table of Contents, go for Bookmark first. Bookmark can fetch virtually anything Contents can (save for a few cards, but including Comic Hand) and can give you instant GY setup to protect Toon Kingdom when it's out. But if you already do have a Kingdom out, Bookmark can tech Page-Flip or Terror easily. It's your choice depending on if you want to play ""Protect the Castle"" or start stomping on your opponent's guts from the get-go.  If you're using Page-Flip, always, and I mean ALWAYS go for Toon Dark Magician, Red-Eyes or BLS. If you strike gold with BLS, you've succeeded in cheating out your deck's boss monster. If you get Dark Magician, you have access to the Rank 7 engine, by virtue of fishing Red-Eyes as material. Or, you can use him to cheat out BLS. And if you get Red-Eyes, and you have DM or BLS in your hand, well. The game's your oyster at this point.  Number 68 is there because it was the only Rank 8 I had on hand at the time, plus there was a situation where I wished I had one to use.   Instant Fusion is so you can cheese out the Cyber Dragon Infinity engine easy-peasy. I know it ain't the unstoppable Godzilla it used to be, but with this deck, I'm looking to milk whatever advantage I can out of the monsters I put in.  Anyway, I'm a guy who runs Toons unapologetically, and I'm off to play some Pokemon Go. Let me know how this deck runs for you."

It's kinda decent, can be improoved easily with a few non-structure deck cards. Mainly some extra deck monsters.  So, quick explanation. You have Dark Beckoning Beast and Opening of the Spirit Gates, two openers. If you only draw one in the first hand, you want to search the other one with the effect. If you have two and no Dark/Chaos Summoning Beast, search those. The combo would be summoning Dark Beckoning into tribute summon for Dark Summoning, using Opening to discard Chaos and summon it back (Since the cost happens before the effect you can actually do this) and then summon a sacred beast from the deck. Then, with Dark Summoning's gy effect, you search another one if needed and summon it with Chaos, and if you need the field spell he can also search it.  As far as I'm aware the deck runs only one garnet, wich would be Mound of the bountiful creator, wich is mainly for both disrupting your opponent's plays if they run field spells and getting your own field spell. The good thing about this deck is that even if you draw a garnet or an useless card, there are a lot of effects of discard to get something from the gy.  Anyways, the perfect hand would be Opening of the Spirit Gates, Dark Beckoning Beast, Chaos and/or Dark Summoning Beast and then any other card(s). So, what you'd do is use Dark Beckoning to add Awakening of the Sacred Beasts, do the previous described combo to summon two sacred beasts, and if on top of that you have field barrier, cerulean skyfire and/or mistake, you'll be able to put it really hard for your opponent, often instant locking them down.  Another combo you can do, if you want, is normal summon Dark Beckoning, search for Chaos Core, normal summon it thanks to Dark Beckoning, link Dark Beckoning into Salamangreat Almiraj, target Chaos Core, send three sacred beasts to the GY and you can get Armityle just like that.  Good extra deck cards are Salamangreat Almiraj to get rid of Dark Beckoning if you can't other way, Pentestag to deal tons of damage with Raviel and often OTK and not much more.  And a good main deck card to add would be Pot of Acquisitiveness, mainly to unbanish the sacred beasts and/or the beasts."

The strength is that you can use this effect in the opponents battle phase too before the opponent attacks, so if you get a fast summon with <a data-name=""escape from the dark dimension"">escape from the dark dimension</a> or its own effect this can be a good counter. You also don't have to destroy 3 monsters if you throw 3 times 'head', this is the case for <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a>, so <a data-name=""Gatling dragon"">Gatling dragon</a> could destroy itself or your own monsters if you are unlucky, which makes the <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> way better. It has a nice last effect that improves the draw engine a bit, if it gets destroyed or if you discard it with <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> or <a data-name=""One for one"">One for one</a> then you get a <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> from the deck to the hand, which can be used for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> for example.  <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher</a> – It's part of the draw-engine because you can discard it with <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> and you won't lose anything by it because it doesn't matter if you special summon it from the hand or the graveyard. You can also destroy a face-up monster with it's effect by banishing 3 cards from the extra-deck, but only when you didn't already use it's other effect. You can also use it as a discard or target for <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, <a data-name=""BM-4 Blast Spider"">BM-4 Blast Spider</a>, or for a fusion, tribute or synchro-summon, which makes it very effective in a combination with other cards.  <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> – the deck needs a lot of immunity and negates to support the machines and their effects, so <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> fits best as a dark machine. <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> can also be summoned with <a data-name=""Escape from the dark dimension"">Escape from the dark dimension</a> even when it is a trap, because the trap does not get destroyed by <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a>'s effect and the negation happens after the summon.  <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> – You have to get two times head out of three coin tosses, but it doesn't matter if it does not work, the strengeth is that it can be used as the only barrel dragon on spell and trap cards whcih is most of the time worth it. If you can destroy a card it can possibly also trigger the effect of <a data-name=""Heavy metal raiders"">Heavy metal raiders</a> to summon a dark machine from the hand, this effect can be used before the battle phase so it is easier to plan with it, you can for example use the effect and then tribute it, fusion summon a <a data-name=""Gatling dragon"">Gatling dragon</a>, or xyz summon <a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a>.  <a data-name=""BM-4 Blast Spider"">BM-4 Blast Spider</a> – It can trigger the special summon of <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> and destroy a monster, this is worth most of the times if the opponent does not has any negations, it can also trigger the special summon effect of <a data-name=""heavy metal raiders"">heavy metal raiders</a>.  <a data-name=""Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a>, <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>, <a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> – The token and fast summon engine to support the more slow dark machines with link monsters. <a data-name=""Unknown synchron"">Unknown synchron</a> is a dark machine and always good, with two lvl 4 monsters or tokens you can summon <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a> which can destroy one monster one time, but you don't have to toss a coin for the effect, <a data-name=""The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> can get a tuner if you don't have <a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a> but a compass token for example. <a data-name=""The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> can also be used to get a fast <a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a> to spawn a random card from either Graveyard but you can only use it without other monsters and when the opponent already has cards on the field.  <a data-name=""The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a> – With <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> you can summon a <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a>, with any effect monster you can summon <a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a> for a better effect negation, and if you already turned a <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a> to <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> you can summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> which is the best fusion summon option if you get the cards for it.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> -  <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Millenium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a> can be summoned with the effect of <a data-name=""The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> can be summoned by it's own effect when you have <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>, you can either fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> then with it or you can use it to defend because it has to be destroyed before your opponennt can attack your other monsters and it can not be destroyed ba battle. <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> has a very good effect negation, and effect negations are very good together with the already strong destroy-effects of the barrel dragons and some other cards, to get a fusion summon to summon it you need 2 <a data-name=""The Dark – Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a> in total, or use only 1 and one <a data-name=""instant fusion"">instant fusion</a> or you can use one and the <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>. <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> is only in the deck for <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> because it is a better target than <a data-name=""Millenium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>.  <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>, <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> –  <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> and <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> can make Tokens to effect monsters to then use the link monster effects of <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and draw cards with it and to summon the link-3 and link-4 monsters. <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> is the strongest card because of it's immunity against card effects and it's destroy-effect in battle, and can be fast summoned with the tokens of <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> or <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>. <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a> is the alternative if you need more atk against one monster, when you get a <a data-name=""Triple burst dragon"">Triple burst dragon</a> before you summon <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a> you can attack with 4400 atk for one turn, and it is easier to summon <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a> than <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> because you only need 2 monsters when you already have link-2 or link-3 monsters.  <a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a> – It can be rarely used, because it's uncommon to get 2 <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a>s or a <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a>, but if that happens, then you can use <a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a> to steal the opponent monsters.  <a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a>, <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a> – 2 Good Synchro monsters - <a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a> just for stall with a lvl 4 and a lvl 1 monster, and <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a> to destroy one monster with it's effect without throwing a coin.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> - The draw-engine, with <a data-name=""allure of darkness"">allure of darkness</a> you can summon monsters with <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark Dimension"">Escape from the Dark Dimension</a> later. For <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> you have 5 monsters you can use, the <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a>s have an effect that will give you a <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> to the hand, and <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher</a> can be tributed for free because you can summon it from the Graveyard. If you use or want to use <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> you can not special summon this turn but it's very effective and can get you the right traps and spells or another draw-card. With <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity you can Ban </a><a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a><a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">, </a><a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a><a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">, </a><a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a><a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">, </a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">, </a><a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus""> and </a><a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus""> without losing the main combo's which makes it a great card and easier to use than </a><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">.</a>  <a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> – If you get it all your dark machines can not get destroyed by battle anymore, which makes it easy to use the effects of them, without it they tend to be slow, but with it, it can get very fast and everytime you destroy a card with a dark machine you can summon another one from the hand. You can also attack monsters with higher atk to get the same atk as them, but you have to pay the difference in life points, this can be very helpful against cards that have effect immunity and can only be destroyed by battle.  <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>, <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a> – Effect negations make it much easier to destroy monsters with the monster effects that you have anyway, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> is a good backup card that can trigger <a data-name=""Chain Whirlwind"">Chain Whirlwind</a>.  <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion, </a><a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> – <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> is great to get either a link monster faster, or to fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> when you have <a data-name=""The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a>.

I ended up going 5-3 and finished 46th out of about 190 players. The tri-brigade package ended up doing ALOT more then I thought they would. The main goal is to get zeus or megaclopis out. It normally takes a decent amount of resources and planning for your opponent to get over zeus or megaclopis so being able to then pivot into the link 4 tri-brigade and re build your board is extremely effective. Also, the link 4's non targeting banishing is HUGE in removing tough cards on the field. Also the when the link 4 is sent to the gy it allows you to search ad it does not have to be a tri-brigade monster (if you have 8 banished you can even grab alpha). Still working on what hand traps I need to be playing but overall I was very pleased with how this deck performed."

Used for CYS 29/11/20.,"This deck is not particularly good. However, I really like the playstyle of U.A. and I was interested in taking its actually promising core of an omni-negate, strong card destruction, consistency, and occasional runaway wins with Jersey and turning it into something more. Naturally, I added Dogmatikas to the list. The vast majority of the metagame right now summons from the Extra Deck and you're ideally going second with this deck, so your Dogmatikas <em>should </em>be switched on by default.  Some notes:  -This deck was made for the CYS series 29/11/20, and so <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> was not legal. I recommend cutting the <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>/<a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">U.A. Penalty Box</a> engine and replacing <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> with <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> if you're playing in a format with it legal, adding a Powered Jersey and playing around with maindecking varying numbers of handtraps, Dogmatika Punishment and DRNM with the remaining space. Having played both forms of the deck, the Disparity version is slightly better, but this edition is more battle-tested and more consistent for the U.A.s with the Penalty Box engine.  -This deck has a major weakness to <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. Our only real outs in the maindeck are hoping that </a><a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a><a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">, U.A. Penalty Box's banish effect or </a><a data-name=""U.A. Player Manager"">U.A. Player Manager's non-targeted negation resolve,</a><a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box""> and Gamciel</a><a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">. Thankfully, with the big boy himself negated or popped with a kaiju we have a variety of card destruction effects to clear the rest of the field and.... relatively resilient lines of play, should there still be interaction up.</a>  -If you go first, you ideally use both your Stadiums together to normal summon the same <a data-name=""U.A. Libero Spiker"">U.A. Libero Spiker</a> twice and search three times, ending on a board of <a data-name=""U.A. Perfect Ace"">U.A. Perfect Ace and </a><a data-name=""U.A. Blockbacker"">U.A. Blockbacker in defense position and a </a><a data-name=""U.A. Libero Spiker"">U.A. Libero Spiker</a><a data-name=""U.A. Blockbacker""> whose effect you will activate at some point in the opponents' turn to disrupt their play with either another Ace or a </a><a data-name=""U.A. Player Manager"">U.A. Player Manager. </a><a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium's ATK-increasing effect can be more or less ignored turn 1, but is very important to consider going second and on subsequent turns.</a>  -If you go second: Dunkers and Dogmatikas. Just... figure it out. Against a board of multiple omni-negates you're probably going to fold unless you draw Gamciel or sideboarded DRNM, but the deck is surprisingly effective at breaking boards that aren't quite so disruptive! You can run away with games that would otherwise be lost surprisingly easily by abusing <a data-name=""U.A. Dreadnought Dunker"">U.A. Dreadnought Dunker</a>'s high ATK, piercing battle damage, and card destruction along with <a data-name=""U.A. Powered Jersey"">U.A. Powered Jersey</a>'s excess damage doubling and twice-per-turn (if you kill a monster) attacking. <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> is also extremely powerful, sending <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss to the GY for card destruction and starting your Dogmatika chain is a lot of value for one card.</a>  -Dark Ruler No More switches off Dunker's effect. I have made this mistake way too many times, and so I'm now maindecking Gamciel rather than DRNM - the anti-synergy is just really really bad, but sometimes you do need DRNM so it's in the sideboard.  -As always, sideboarding is important. DRNM and Nibiru are my most common swap-ins, but <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> are of course very useful in situations that demand them. Graveyard hate is on there too because, graveyard hate.  -The small amount of the effect U.A.s, cut to free up space for the Dogmatikas and to make the deck less bricky, means that the deck runs out of steam against boardclears pretty quickly. If you want to run Rebounder to shore up this weakness, don't, the card sucks. I've been playing various variants of U.A. for a month or so now and I've literally never resolved its effect.  -please don't blame me for you losing i'm working with an archetype that was weak even for 2015 when it was released and im jamming a good current archetype in to bring it a little up to speed  &nbsp;"

Chazz is my favorite character in all of Yu-Gi-Oh and I love all the different designs for Armed Dragons, Ojama, VWXYZ. So, this deck tries to bring all the different kinds of Armed Dragons out semi consistently while keeping to the Chazz's anime deck as closely as possible while doing so. I also made this playable in the TCG format.  Update:  Removed about 5 cards to make the deck more consistent and gave the extra deck more firepower.  Summary:  At the start of the duel, you try to bring out Armed Dragon Thunder LV3 as fast as possible using Dragon Flash or Ojamatching. Once you have Armed Dragon Thunder LV3 that way you can start sacrificing cards to help you get to <span>Armed Dragon Thunder LV10</span>. Then use Armed Dragon Blitz on <span>Armed Dragon Thunder LV10</span> to bring out <span>Armed Dragon LV 10</span>. If you are lucky you pull out an Armed Dragon Lighting or OjamaPajama to give your Armed Dragons extra protection. Armed Dragon Lighting can bring back Armed Dragon monster with equal or less stars than the one on the field you use this to keep bringing back  Armed Dragon Thunder LV 7 your hand and keep discarding it to the graveyard to pull out <span><span>Armed Dragon LV10- White</span></span> or Armed Dragon Thunderbolt incase Armed Dragon Lighting is destroyed.  To summon <span>Armed Dragon LV10- White</span>, you will have Banish 10 stars on the field or graveyard my play is 2 Armed Dragon LV5 in the graveyard. Next, Ojamapajama can sacrifice Ojamamagic for more Ojama cards to discard for effects or use it for ojamadification to bring out <span>Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon</span>. <span>Dark Armed Dragon </span>which I really had trouble putting in this deck but, I think it fits a little since Chazz used Chthonian (dark monsters) I don’t see why he wouldn't use Burning Abyss cards. The Burning Abyss works pretty good since Graff can be used as LV up requirements and he can be easily tossed in the grave to bring out Scram then when Scram is in the graveyard you pull another Burning Abyss monster from your deck which in the end phase is another Graff. Finally, once all three of them are dead you simply just sacrifice Armed Dragon Thunder LV7 to add <span>Dark Armed Dragon </span>to your hand to special summon. Then your board is finally complete with almost every important Armed Dragon boss monsters besides (<span>Metaphys Armed Dragon</span>) we don't talk about him though.  &nbsp;  Extra Notes:  Lastly, I couldn’t add Ojama Pink since I haven't tested him so he will be up later and try to keep the card count low. And if you have any suggestions pls message me I want to hear your guy's opinion on this deck and how I can improve it.

This deck is for you. It's worked well for me so far.,"I love playing Heroes but I was tired of people winning games by throwing out Dragoon mid-game and winning. So I threw in my Super Polys, said f*ck the hand trap clutter, and decided to main deck S/T removal because back row and floodgates can suck a fat one. Your opponent uses Ash Blossom? Well that sucks but I got 2 more searches and Ash is a hard once per turn or I got the 1 Called By The Grave.  Chain Mask Change on your Stratos when your opponent tries to Imperm or Effect Veiler your monster. Search still goes through.  Fusion Destiny is great but you don't need 3. U can only use it twice really and otherwise it becomes a huge brick. I remember I needed something like Stratos but drew Fusion Destiny after all my targets for it are in grave or banished mid game. Scoop. With 2 you have a chance to draw 1 and decrease your chance of bricking with 2 or drawing one when you don't need it.  Some people may be saddened that the Evil Hero package is not present. Yeah I love using Bane too but he's not necessary to win. For those who don't have him yet this also makes my build more budget. If there was room I'd add him in but I like keeping my decks as close to 40 cards as possible.  &nbsp;  For the Extra Deck I add Starving Venom, Escuridao, and The Shining purely for Super Poly. Super Poly is not once per turn and that won me one game against Dragon Link. ""Oh you have a negate for Nibiru or some other hand trap? That's cool."" Super Poly ends that conversation.  In that game against Dragon Link my opponent ended his turn one board with Dragoon, Verte, and a Herald of Arc Light. I summoned Solid Soldier, used Super Poly. Fused off Verte and Goon into Starving Venom, played the 2nd fused Herald and Solid Soldier for Shining. He took away his negates, did my combo and OTKed.  Everything else in the deck is what you expect from HEROs. Absolute Zero can work as a Super Poly option as well if your playing against a Water deck.  &nbsp;  The power of HEROs is their Flexibility in my opinion. You got a Hero or card for most of what you will face now whether you can get to that Hero and maintain him on the field is a different story. For everything else I got what is in my side deck. Go right ahead and fix ur side deck for whatever you normally deal with but for my Side deck I got simple options. The Main Deck is good either first or second. Got the Twisters/Duster for the Backrow and Super Poly for the annoyances. Most decks want to go first now a days that includes HEROs.  I'd rather put my Law, Absolute/Acid, or Plasma on the field to stop my opponent from playing or setting up. If going first I can set Poly or Twisters/Duster. So Game 1 I win because my deck is prepared or I lose because some BS. Going to Game 2 I opt to go first and side out Polys or Twisters/Duster for whatever I just faced. Altergeist or a trap focused deck? Decree/Reboot. Spell heavy decks like Striker for example. Anti Spell Fragrance just make sure your board is ready before u activate cause it will screw us too so gotta becareful. Combo deck? Droll or Nibiru. Lancea is pretty much for Dinos. I threw in Great Tornado to help combat Virtual Worlds.  &nbsp;  Anyways try it out tell me what you think."

This deck has two main functions that are the core of the deck.  a)Get Red-Eyes Slash Dragon out as fast as possible and continue to summon/revive your cards in the process.  b)Get Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword attached to any of your monsters to create a beat stick. This would preferably be Slash Dragon for the safety reason, but anything works really.  Rocket Hermos and Time Magic Hammer are there in case either main functions don't work out. Really, the three oddity cards (Time Wizard, Rocket Warrior, Amazoness Swords Woman) are there for security purposes.  -Time Wizard gives you a chance to gamble away your opponents cards.  -Amazoness Swords Woman allows you to possibly blow up your opponent (or at least disrupt their strategy) by launching yourself into their own beat stick.  -Rocket Warrior is useless, but he looks cool.  A/D changer is very useful when summoning Slash Dragon, as he allows you easy access to changing your opponents cards positions.  &nbsp;  If it's turn one, it's best to use A/D changer when summoning Slash Dragon, as you won't get to attach him immediately anyway.  If you are on turn two+, you are best using one of the other warrior cards.  &nbsp;  All of the XYZ cards are just there because their artwork looks kinda cool.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

So, with this deck I made it a going second deck and you need to use all of your handtraps to use on the opponent and them destroy them with dark magician spam on the next turn. If they are running something that can run through basically any handtrap (Dragon link) I also have evenly matched in the main deck. If you want to win I wouldn't advise playing this deck, Just play dragon link.

Your goal is simple: Get rid of any problematic monsters with your Kaiju cards, while also making your normal plays with your Burning Abyss monsters. Because BA is possibly the most xenophobic archetype in Yu-Gi-Oh, you absolutely <em><strong>cannot</strong></em> have the Main Deck BA monsters and Kaijus out without also controlling Cherubini, or Fiendish Rhino Warrior.  &nbsp;  However, if you need to go first, you're not totally screwed. You can use Cherubini and IP: Masquerena to link summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. There's only so much your opponent can do against a Link 4 that can't be targeted or destroyed by card effects,  and will destroy most Special Summoned monsters by battle. And even if your opponent does send it to the Graveyard, you can shuffle a card on the field into the deck without targeting!  &nbsp;  I named this deck ""Who Will Know"", after the theme song of Shin Godzilla, the antagonist of the 2016 movie <em>Shin Godzilla</em>. I actually watched this movie about a month ago, and it was one of the best Godzilla movies I've ever seen, so I made this Burning Abyss Kaiju deck in honor of it. I'm not gonna give any spoilers, but Shin Godzilla is quite possibly the creepiest design that the Big G has ever had! He looks like he just crawled out of Hell, so it was kind of appropriate.    In addition to that, the movie does have quite a bit of blood and grotesque imagery, including a scene where small Godzilla-human hybrids are seen <em><strong>growing out of Shin Godzilla's tail</strong></em>. So if you're a fan of body horror, monster movies, or just the king of monsters, <em>Shin Godzilla</em> is the movie for you!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The name here is in reference to Legendary Pictures and Toho, the two film studios which made every Godzilla movie except Godzilla 1998. We don't talk about Godzilla 1998. But given the medival/RPG theme of Crusadia, and the presence of Kaijus in this deck, ""Legendary Kingdom Toho"" was an appropriate name for it.  &nbsp;  While Crusadia is already a go-second deck, adding Kaijus to them will take this to an absolute extreme. Your goal with Kaijus is to use them to get rid of your opponent's monsters, while also giving yourself a big beater. As for the Crusadia monsters, your goal is to use them to link climb into the best Link Monster you can summon. And in a lot of cases for me, that was Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. If the Crusadia monsters summoned themselves from the hand in Attack Position, I'd be using Borrelsword a LOT more. But Borrelsword is still a great monster if you get to summon it.  &nbsp;  Thankfully, Crusadia Arboria is a Tuner. So after searching Crusadia Testament with Crusadia Regulex, you can special summon Arboria, and use them both to summon Crystron Halquifibrax, using it to summon another Arboria. Then you can special summon another Crusadia monster from your hand, use both Crusadia monsters to summon IP: Masquerena. Then use Halq and Masquerena to link summon Avramax! By the way, sitting on an Avramax that was Link Summoned with Masquerena is gonna be your only first-turn play.  &nbsp;  If you do that, you'll be having a Link Monster that can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's effects, protects your other monsters from being attacked, and can't be destroyed by battle with most Special Summoned monsters. Oh, and if your opponent CAN destroy it by battle, just banish Arboria from your field or Graveyard! In addition, if Avramax destroys a monster by battle, then you can activate Crusadia Testament and draw 4 cards!  &nbsp;  Really, in a lot of cases, I don't OTK with this souped-up Avramax, but my opponent surrenders because they don't have any cards that can get rid of it."

New Eldlich cards are in the pipe, but not particularly interesting to me anyways. Still, I decided to update the list slightly for the times.  Eldlich line-up is still the same, I don't see much reason to change anything. You could run another White Eldlixir if you wanted, just to run more Eldlixirs, but space is tight, so I don't want to. We're running 3 Golden Lord, 3 Cursed Eldland to see Golden Lord, and 3 Red Eldlixir with 1 White to summon Golden Lord. 3 of each trap monster makes a lot of sense to me, you want searchable interaction, you want bodies on the table, and these get you those. We run a single Golden Land Forever! since it is searchable, rounding us out with a good omni-negate, and 3 Solemn Judgement. Judgement could be something else, I just like having answers to Feather Duster and Lightning Storm that are generically useful. This card can also negate summons of monsters at Spell Speed 3, which is nothing to sneeze at. It doesn't answer effects that activate in places other than the field, but it's a useful generic trap that makes you harder to out and answers anything that hits the table.  For Dogmatika line-up ,we're still eschewing Maxmimus, and instead are running 3 of each starter and 2 of each searching target. Dogmatika Punishment is, in my opinion, a powerful generic trap in its own right. The restrictions on it keep it from being played in everything, but if you don't need the extra deck the card is pushed. It pops 2, or pops 1 and searches, and since Dogma likes putting extra deck monsters in the GY this is simultaneously one of the best interruptions in the game and essentially extra searchers. Fleurdelis I'm not as high on, obviously generic negation that doesn't target is good, and it is the Dogma engine's main way to output damage, but it doesn't do anything if you don't see Ecclesia. You still need 2 to search out over the course of the game, but unlike Punishment I wouldn't ever consider running 3.  Shaddoll Schism is the deck's other true brick. You do not want to see this card - you DO however want to discard Golden Lord off of Nadir Servant AND search a trap to use to summon it back. This one brick dramatically increases the consistency of the deck by adding that optional discard option, and even without any Shaddolls to pay it off pulls its weight. I highly recommend it in Eldlich/Dogma builds. I tried running Shaddolls you could fusion summon with it, but tbh they weren't worth the space in the extra deck.  For hand traps we're running 3 Imperm, a good generic field negate that has the advantage of being a trap card, which is important in an Eldlich deck, 3 Ash Blossom, a good generic hand trap that is also one of the only ones that hits Virtual World, and Skull Meister, which splits the difference between D.D. Crow and Lancea, good against Dinos and Virtual World, while still being generic enough to hit other commons decks in some way, such as slowing down Eldlich or Dogmatika, and interrupting combos (if not at their weakest points). I needed hand traps that would be useful against Virtual World while remaining impactful against the rest of the meta, and while Imperm kind of misses the bill, it makes up for it by summoning Golden Lord.  Extra deck is actually mostly to dump. Apkallone is how we're extra deck dumps to put Golden Lords in the bin. Titaniklad (that Bastard) is typitcally what makes Nadir Servant such a broken card, and is part of the reason Dogmatika Punishment is such a broken card, and you want 2 of them. 3 N'tss might be a little high, but I wanted an extra one, to occasionally ditch with Nadir Servant. I think at least 1 for each Punishment is correct - might as well get the full value out of punishment. Wind Pegasus trades removal for removal, it's a good thing to ditch when you have Nadir Servant with another Dogma card in hand. The Cyber Dragon Nova / Invoked Mechaba engine is run in case people Maximus the deck - these aren't strictly necessary but there's space for them. Maybe you'd like I:P or other extra deck monsters over it, I just like the cheeky wins.  The Trains are where we start to get into the things you summon. Dogma cards really restrict your options in terms of summoning from the extra deck, but the trains are here for Eldlich OTKS, Vampire Sucker is here to draw cards when the game is in a simplified state, and to put Golden Lords and Golden Land monsters back into the GY, and is probably the monster I summon most from the extra deck. You could run 2 Suckers, and it would make sense, (maybe over the Nova package). Obligatory Knightmares give the deck some spell/trap removal in the extra deck, and occasionally come up. Borreload Dragon could in theory come up, it gives the extra deck a hard to answer form of removal, but realistically you're barely going into the extra deck, so maybe this could be something else.  Token Collector is a really good card against Auroradon combos, most notable Infernoble Knights, and is situationally useful against Linkross as well. Gnomaterial can help stop Zoodiac, that's literally all it is here for. After that it's a suite of backrow removal, including Pankratops, and 3 Appointer of the Red Lotus for when you're going first, to stop those blow-out cards like Feather Duster and Lightning Storm, which will be more common game 2-3."

Traditional Core with some support.,"The deck features a back to basics core quite similar to a pure Cyber Dragon deck with some spice for various matchups. Monsters in the main are my tailor-made picks for A <strong>40</strong> card standard, featuring support monsters primarily being <strong>Light/Machine</strong>. For those of you wanting a <strong>60</strong> card variant, feel free to toss in the side deck along with the typical commonplace staples <em>(IE: Ash, Twin twisters, .etc) </em>While I recommend the base 40 for streamlined optimization &amp; mitigating the chances of dead draws, a deck of 60 does boost your <strong>OTK</strong> damage with the utilization of the Chimeratech cards.  Moving forward, while the main deck was dedicated to the core build, there is some variation however in the Extra Deck, giving you choices for counter-plays &amp; going 2nd which I feel supplement the deck nicely but still give it that classic feel. As for the staple spells, many people play with ""<strong>3 Ofs</strong>"" but I find that running <strong>2</strong> for certain cards can sometimes be the golden ratio.  But of course, for those who can't do without, feel free to make adjustments by utilizing the side deck backups or make changes by swapping out some cards to accommodate your playstyle. For those looking to pick up Cydra or coming back to it, your bread &amp; butter win condition is still mainly <strong>Fusion</strong> <strong>+ OTK</strong> for big damage/multiple attacks. This deck was built with that fundamental in mind but also with simplicity to be played casually by those looking to have fun with the archetype and for those who want to strategically play Cyber Dragons with something more than pure but without going too far off in the deep end with variants. <em>(IE: Infinitracks, Calamity, Orcust .etc) </em>  That being said, the deck is quite adaptable so play as you see fit.

""Simorgh"" is actually a pretty interesting archetype in my opinion, stemming from the first Wind-Attribute Structure Deck back in the day which included ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Divinity"">Simorgh, Bird of Divinity</a>"" as its boss monster and gave one of the biggest monsters in the archetype ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" its name. ""Simorgh"" as an archetype consists entirely of Winged Beasts and the strategy puts its focus on interaction with both players backrows and Normal/Tribute Summoning. In case you are wondering: Since I want to mention some of the interactions in the deck, I will not go strictly by monster, backrow, Extra Deck, but instead mention whatever comes naturally and makes sense at that point in time.</p> <p>For starters, the deck actively makes use of its smaller members: ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Beginning"">Simorgh, Bird of Beginning</a>"" gives you another Normal Summon upon being Normal Summoned, which makes it a great monster to include into your summon chain if you have anything else to summon afterwards; ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Bringing"">Simorgh, Bird of Bringing</a>"" is the archetypal searcher and therefore fetches you whatever card you need or is missing; and ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"" is a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" on legs, allowing for easy Link climbing with certain cards form the Extra Deck. All of those monsters have an additional effect that allows you to Special Summon them from the graveyard if the opponent has no backrow, but they get banished afterwards and locks your Extra Deck summons into the Winged Beast-typing. However, this effect allows you to get further mileage out of your monsters and is paramount for setting up a strong board; but I will come to that.</p> <p>The bigger monsters in form of ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" provide useful control effects in form of negates and bounces, but while ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" only goes back to the hand from your graveyard when a Winged Beast monster in destroyed in battle, ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" actually serves as solid recurring beater, since it will enter the field from either the hand or the graveyard when a Tribute Summon occurs. You can therefore set it up in the graveyard, Tribute Summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" and gain the other bird for free. This notion is also supported by ""<a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>"", which can discard ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" since it is a Level 8 monster and ""<a data-name=""Simorgh Onslaught"">Simorgh Onslaught</a>"", which will search for further useful monsters while putting ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" right where you want to have it.</p> <p>The most important Extra Deck monster to summon by far is ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"". This beast allows you free Winged Beast monster summons from the deck and sets up ""<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>"" to stop most opponent's Special Summons or ""<a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a>"" to keep the opponent from using Spell cards rightaway. On top of that it has various protection-esque effects that make handling your board that much harder. Going into this monster is very much possible with the aforementioned smaller ""Simorgh"" monsters: You can get up to three Normal Summons per turn in the archetype (the one Normal Summon you have anyway, one via ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Beginning"">Simorgh, Bird of Beginning</a>"" and one via ""<a data-name=""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh</a>"") which is exactly the number of monsters needed for ""<a data-name=""Bird of Sovereignty"">Bird of Sovereignty</a>"". But there are also better options available. Since all of the small birds can be re-summoned, you can make elaborate summoning chains with no real cost or effort: Summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"", ditch any of the Level 1-4 ""Simorgh"" monsters, re-summon the ditched monster, Special Summon ""<a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a>"" from your Extra Deck, then re-summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"" to use both it and ""<a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a>"" to summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"". That is, while it uses multiple cards to get it running, a combo that only uses one card from your hand to work. There are various other scenarios you can use with the small bird, just keep in mind that you want to get the free summon of ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"" at the end of it all, so there should be a certain priority attached to summoning it.</p> <p>The rest of the Main Deck monsters serves to help the board come into shape: ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Protection"">Simorgh, Bird of Protection</a>"" works similarly to the other small ""Simorgh"" in that it has the same re-summoning effect but actually takes care of pesky backrow should that be required. It is simply not that highly needed and can be searched, so I only run one copy of it. ""<a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</a>"" has a recurrence effect similar to the smaller ""Simorghs"" but also features the Dark Attribute, which allows you to summon ""<a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a>"" via its own effect more often. Talking about ""<a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a>"", the deck can use the ""Dark Simorgh lock"" with relative ease, which is exactly the reason why there are two copies of ""<a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a>"" in the deck. Stopping the opponent from using Spell cards temporarily is nice, but barring them from using such cards altogether is better. ""<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>"" is a very nice addition in my opinion and was/is commonly used in combination with ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>""; but in a pure ""Simorgh"" deck, you even have the option of summoning it during your summon chain since ""<a data-name=""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh</a>"" allows the summon of any Wind Winged Beast monster, not just ""Simorgh"". ""<a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a>"" is a solid option for effect negation that can also be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>""; there is also the option of running the combo with ""<a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>"", but that was too expensive in my opinion. Lastly ""<a data-name=""Raiza the Mega Monarch"">Raiza the Mega Monarch</a>"" is a Wind Winged Beast that profits from being Tribute Summoned and seemed to be a pretty strong option in certain situations, so in it goes.</p> <p>The backrow is rather straightforward: Three ""<a data-name=""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh</a>"" give stat boosts, easier Tribute Summoning and further Normal Summons, three ""<a data-name=""Simorgh Onslaught"">Simorgh Onslaught</a>"" work as the double searchers and setup for cards like ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"", two ""<a data-name=""The Monarchs Stormforth"">The Monarchs Stormforth</a>"" can clear the opposing field while you profit via Tribute Summons, two ""<a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>"" as helpful and inexpensive draw options, two ""<a data-name=""Simorgh Repulsion"">Simorgh Repulsion</a>"" against opposing backrow, ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" for the same setup scenario I described when talking about ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for obvious monster revival, and one ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" to have access to the Field Spell more often. The Traps consist of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a>"", which I have already explained and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a>"" as pretty insane effect negation.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is pretty budget-friendly in my opinion and leaves room for changes: ""<a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>"" is both useful for Link Climbing and a pretty solid option overall, ""<a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a>"" is used for the Link Climbing into ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Rubberband Shooter"">Hi-Speedroid Rubberband Shooter</a>"" is another option for more Normal Summons, both ""<a data-name=""Fire-Fighting Daruma Doll"">Fire-Fighting Daruma Doll</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" serve as backrow removal and the two Xyz options can be reached with relative ease if ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" is involved. A cheap monster removal option that one can climb into is possible with the three monsters ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Detonate Deleter"">Detonate Deleter</a>"": If ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" is summoned first, you can bounce one monster via ""<a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a>"" since it will be linked with the Link Arrow from ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"". If you then go into ""<a data-name=""Detonate Deleter"">Detonate Deleter</a>"", you can use one of the excess ""Simorghs"" to tribute for its effect to get rid of another monster, while a third would automatically be destroyed via the first effect of ""<a data-name=""Detonate Deleter"">Detonate Deleter</a>"", handling a total of three monsters if unimpeded. Granted, the combo is easily negate- and obstructable, but it is a dirt-cheap way to gain board control in certain situations.</p> <p>I found ""Simorgh"" to be a fun and interactive archetype that can be scaled upwards if the budget allows it. As usual, I wrote a more in-depth analysis about the entire archetype and all cards in it plus useful cards and hints that I simply cannot all fit in here.

The point of this deck is to control the actions that your opponent takes with each of the<strong> Security Force</strong> monsters doing something different. You aren't that able to interact with your opponent by moving around your <strong>Security Force</strong> monsters very often on their turn as <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Specimen"">Security Force Specimen</a></strong> is a hard once per turn for each effect and it is decently hard to put it into your graveyard. The only way you can really truly interact with your opponent on their turn is if you run <strong><a data-name=""Reinforce Truth"">Reinforce Truth</a></strong> in the maindeck, but I highly advise against it as it doesn't do anything if you are forced to go second; most it can do is be a discard for<strong> Magicians' Soul</strong>'s draw effect.  The <strong>Security Force</strong> lineup consists of playsets of <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Pla-Tina"">Security Force Pla-Tina</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Gravitino"">Security Force Gravitino</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Orifice"">Security Force Orifice</a></strong>, and<strong> <a data-name=""Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru"">Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru</a></strong>. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Security Force Professor Digamma&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Security Force Professor Digamma</strong> </a>is a terrible card whose control effect is very niche and doesn't come up for the most part in modern Yu-Gi-Oh!. Restrictions on Battle Positions will only prevent you from getting OTKed, but most decks are focusing more on making negated instead which is why we aren't running him even though he is a target for <strong>E-Tele</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru"">Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru</a></strong> is your one card starter. He/She (I really don't know) bounces him/herself and banishes a <strong>Security Force</strong> monster from your hand to SS one from your deck. Also there's an almost irrelevant attacking restriction for your opponent. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Pla-Tina"">Security Force Pla-Tina</a></strong> lowers the ATK of your opponent's monsters in columns w/ <strong>Security Force</strong> monsters. The important thing about her is that 1) She's a <strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> target and 2) She SS a banished <strong>Security Force</strong> monster which means you can summon the <strong>Security Force</strong> monster that you banished off of <strong>Chiyomaru</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Gravitino"">Security Force Gravitino</a></strong> banishes monsters in the same column as it when they leave the field and it searches a security force card on summon. This is the card you most want to banish off of<strong> Chiyomaru</strong> since it has a very relevant control effect and it searches any card in the archetype.<strong> <a data-name=""Security Force Orifice"">Security Force Orifice</a></strong> prevents your opponent targeting their monsters with effects in the same column as <strong>Security Force</strong> monsters and he can destroy a monster upon their effect activation after you banish a<strong> Security Force</strong> from hand. It doesn't negate which is unfortunate, but it can deal with some(?) decks' starters and provide adequate banishing set-up.  The other monsters in the main deck provide more set-up for your Security Force plays. <strong><a data-name=""Edea the Heavenly Squire"">Edea the Heavenly Squire</a></strong> summons <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> from deck and <strong><a data-name=""Eidos the Underworld Squire"">Eidos the Underworld Squire</a></strong> summons <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> from grave. They both get you to<strong> Chiyomaru</strong> to start your plays, but they restrict Extra Deck summoning which is okay going first sometimes, but they can be a downside going second. You choose to just run 1 <strong>Edea</strong> if you want to make more Extra Deck plays and don't want to see her in your hand all the time. <strong>Eidos</strong> is only run at 1 since you usually are not going to have <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> in your grave for the most part as he/she is safely tucked in your hand (except when you get hit by <strong>Smoke Grenade</strong>). He can be a target for <strong><a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a></strong> when you have access to the extra deck. This allows you to have an easier time getting him into the grave. <strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> sends <strong>Pla-Tina</strong> to grave and is extra draws in this deck yada-yada.  Spell line-up is mostly <strong>Security Force</strong> cards. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Showdown"">Security Force Showdown</a></strong> is an extender and recycles your graveyard <strong>Security Forces</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Bridgehead"">Security Force Bridgehead</a></strong> is another banishing target for <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> and <strong>Orifice</strong>, but it does search a <strong>Security Force</strong> monster on resolution. It mainly combos with <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> to make your monsters immune to battle destruction. <strong><a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a></strong> is for <strong>Edea</strong>. <strong>ROTA</strong> is for <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> (or <strong>Edea</strong>). <strong><a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a></strong> is nice in this deck as your Extra Deck isn't that important and it's not <strong><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a></strong> which means you can use it to search extenders after your main plays.  Trap line-up is pretty normal.<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Infinite Impermanence&lt;/strong&gt;""> <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong></a> for negation and more column control. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Security Force Specimen&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Security Force Specimen</strong> </a>summons a <strong>Security Force</strong> monster from grave or that is banished. It also allows for some column control, but its not the best as each effect of it is a hard once per turn. <strong><a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a></strong> gets you to normal traps faster. And<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt; Imperial Order&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong> Imperial Order</strong> </a>since this deck doesn't ""rely"" on spells as other decks do (by that I mean just discard them off of <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> to draw more cards under <strong>Imperial Order</strong>).  Extra Deck is nothing special. 3 <strong>N'tss</strong> because we have much free space. <strong>Avramax</strong> is an option to wall yourself off. <strong>Accesscode Selene</strong> combo since we are running spellcasters.<strong> Equimax</strong> to link off monsters and for mucho damage. 2<strong> <a data-name=""Security Force Justify"">Security Force Justify</a></strong> to go second or first since it's a negate and removal of up to 3 monsters. <strong>Knightmare</strong> package of course.<strong> Union Carrier</strong> to link off monsters and to equip <strong>Eidos</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a></strong> as another option to link off monsters. And<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Relinquished Anima&lt;/strong&gt;""> <strong>Relinquished Anima</strong> </a>and <strong><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></strong> to make use of lvl 1's.  Side deck. 3 <strong><a data-name=""Wattkinetic Puppeteer"">Wattkinetic Puppeteer</a></strong> which you can choose to maindeck. 3 <strong>Ash</strong>. 3 <strong>Cosmic</strong>. 3 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Warning Point&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Warning Point</strong> </a>and 3 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Banquet of Millions&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Banquet of Millions</strong> </a>since they're <strong>Trap Trick</strong> targets and since you don't care for your Extra Deck.  &nbsp;"
