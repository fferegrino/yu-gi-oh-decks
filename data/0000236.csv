All you need is <strong>Tyrant of D. + Sage with Eyes of Blue</strong>. The pros to this combo compared to other is it uses less brick or other weird engine while still have big staple slot and consistency boosting cards. Santa Claws is used there as Small World bridge, as it has light attribute for Sage and 1200 atk for Tyrant while being useful if drawn because its a kaiju."

This deck gives it all when going 2nd, thanks to the multiple going 2nd options (Chalice, Imperm, Nibiru, DRNM) and also cards like Faris, Destiny fusion, and even adusted gold, which are perfect extenders in case they still manage to stop you.

Fusion destiny is obviously ur strongest card in the whole deck, allowing you to one-card combo Destiny hero Phoenix Enforcer and Plasma.

Unfortunately, the weakness of the deck is always the same: Nibiru.

You can play crossout in the main without any problems, but I do prefer to have it in my side.

While going first, you have multiple ways to play around things like Imperm and Effect veiler, thanks to Mask change and Increase, it's quite hard to stop you because usually, one or two hand-trap aren't enough, or u simply don't care thanks to mask-change/increase.

Always try to make Dark law when possible, even if it's luck-based (if u don't draw mask change u basically can't do Dark law if u want to search it by using liquid to revive shadow mist, u still lose a lot just for dark law)."

Summon loads of level 2 beast type monsters (how to should be pretty obvious if you test draw about 3 times) if you can, if not you set up a way to trigger card effects to summon them in your opponents turn. Preferably summon 2 Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu on your first turn (pro tip, put one in the extra monster zone, because your field will get very full.) use both of their effects to summon the tokens. Both Sandayu's are going to be immune except from effects that return them to the hand (Extra deck in this case) or banish them. Use one Token to trade blows with the highest attack monster and attack directly with the other and attack directly with both Sandayu's. There are also other techniques but they are more obvious, so I wont bother listing them."

The next thing is to prevent the opponent from activating his effects with the quick effect of <strong>Rexsturm</strong> and thus be able to summon other Dinorphia Fusion as the situation warrants.

After having spoiled the enemy's plans, on your next turn you will then be able to summon several Dinorphia or lv4 dinosaur monsters again to be able to do XYZ summoning to monsters that will allow you to finish off with the enemy's monsters (for example: AA-ZEUS)"

So my first deck profile for this year is gonna be Ancient Warriors. Never thought I'd hear about them again...Anyways, this deck is named after the video game franchise ""Dynasty Warriors"", because both of them are inspired by the <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> historical novel.

&nbsp;

Anyway, this deck uses two new support cards revealed in Dimension Force. Tyrannical Dong Ying can search a Spell/Trap, or a Level 7 or higher Ancient Warriors monster. Defying The Warlord's Demands lets you special summon an Ancient Warriors monster, then burns you for 100 Life Points x that monster's Level.

&nbsp;

This deck can either go first or second. If you're going first, your goal is either to end on Double Dragons, Dong Ying, and Lu Feng for at least 2 disruptions. If you're going second, your goal is to summon as many big beaters into you can and pummel your opponent into submission.

Happy New years.,"This is a competitive salamangreat list for 2022, I think that this is the best variant of salamangreat, I believe that the phoenix enforcer is a close second or tied but, this deck plays fine on its own.

<strong>TIPS: </strong>If you are new to salamangreat than this will be helpful, 1, read your cards, simple but effective, 2 If you pitch a salamangreat with cynet mining and add gazelle, than its effect will trigger, Your main target to pitch from deck with gazelle is one of the traps. 3 If you summon from deck with Miragestallio your target is gazelle, or jack jaguar.

<strong>Budget Options:</strong> If you can not afford the deck you can always cut the side deck if you are playing casually only. If the crossouts, and or ash blossom is to expensive add cards like twin twisters, or effect veiler, same with any other hand traps. IF you can not afford an accescode talker than you can add borrelsword, or borreload depending on your budget."

It is undeniable that the deck has come a long way - even becoming playable occasionally. Common Charity will have a good amount of competent decks that gatekeep the format - some with surprising capabilities. I believe some variation of this build of Gren Maju can keep up with the likes of ""Towers"" strategies (often midrange decks that ""turbo"" unaffected monsters with threatening stats) and control strategies, as well as assert dominance over other agro strategies (this deck's forte)

DECK STRATEGY

Many consider Gren Maju to be an OTK deck. Some play it as a stun variant. I Myself view Gren as a Midrange/Control Deck which incidentally can OTK, and have played it this way since Eater Of Millions became legal in the TCG. I personally feel that Gren is best suited for explosive plays, aiming to break the opponent's board (or hard-punish them for not building one on Turn 0). Gren, played in this manner, seeks to accomplish the following win condition against competent decks:
<ol>
 	<li>Force the opponent rapidly deplete resources in the first turn(s) by mass removal and/or insane attack pressure</li>
 	<li>Win in the mid-game by having higher-quality threats than the opponent</li>
</ol>
PROS
<ul>
 	<li>Gren Maju decks, if tuned properly, can reasonably break any board and have decent OTK potential.</li>
 	<li>This particular build blanks opposing spell/trap removal (pre sideboard), as it has no reliance on continuous backrow or field spells.</li>
 	<li>Played skillfully, Gren Maju also provides opportunity for technical plays that exploit the mechanical limitations of some other kinds of decks.</li>
</ul>
CONS
<ul>
 	<li>Gren Maju is inherently weak to backrow. This is offset by mass removal like Lightning storm in Advanced Format, but this weakness is pronounced in Common Charity.</li>
 	<li>Gren is traditionally unable to grind at a high tempo, leaving it at a disadvantage to highly recursive decks - specifically decks that can recur removal.</li>
 	<li>Gren Maju is at a huge disadvantage when hand size is low - despite sometimes insane top-deck draws.</li>
 	<li>Gren must have a plan in the side deck to go 1st if forced to do so during a match</li>
</ul>
The biggest drawback of Gren Maju is related skill/deck-building. First of all, the deck MUST be tuned to a particular meta to be consistently effective against competent decks. This is true for any Rouge Deck. While Gren Maju Decks are fairly intuitive to play, effective deckbuilding is what enables their success. Lastly, you must be very knowledgeable about the rules of the game to be baseline effective at this deck, let alone boast a winning record on a competitive level.

MAIN DECK - MONSTERS

3x Gren Maju Da Eiza

Less ""OTK boi"" and more Removal Through Attacking and lightning-rod for certain negates and removal. Incidentally, sometimes it will result in your opponent's life points being reduced to 0, which is an added bonus. Biggest drawback to Gren is that he is not a 1-Card-Combo... He Needs an enabler to banish cards, which reduces the consistency of this deck. Nonetheless, the upsides far outweighs the downside, and its good enough to name the deck after it...

&nbsp;

3x Eater Of Millions

Depending on the Matchup, the Removal that Eater provides ranges from highly effective to just ok. This card does serve as a secondary Gren Maju, both in terms of removal through attacking and winning through damage output.

&nbsp;

3x Necroface

A tertiary Gren Maju, again serving as removal through attacking and winning through damage output. HOWEVER, this is a ""non-bo"" with Gren while, as well as a conflicting Normal Summon. These drawbacks are balanced with this card's synery with gold sarcophagus and enabling you to grind (sometimes indefinately). Normal Summoning Necroface may result in continued plays with Gizmek Orochi, pot of desires, etc.

&nbsp;

3x GizMek Orochi, The Serpentine Sky Slasher

Easily the best monster in the deck. It fades battle damage by soaking up an attack or simply ""flashes-in"" on your opponent's end phase, is spell speed 1 monster removal, and has decent stats... All while fueling Gren Maju, Eater, or Necroface. This card's  quick effect to special summon itself is very good, and its ability to destroy a face-up monster is good too (when you have the opportunity to use it).

&nbsp;

3x Divine Serpent Geh.

Easily the Worst Monster in the Deck. It is situational, costs half of your life points to use, and takes a little experience to get the feel for when it is good and what situational synergies it brings to the deck. However, it is untargetable, and can usually get over any monster your opponent controls (as long as they have not gained atk). Furthermore, it negates random things like Flip effects during the damage step when it declares an attack, as well as certain problematic continuous effects of the attack target. This card is usually really good against decks that rely on targeted removal.     In an alternate universe, this card is D. D. Assault Carrier, if that card was actually playable.

&nbsp;

3x Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju

This card enables removing a ""Towers""-like monster from the board. Its the Lowest ATK Kaiju at common rarity, and is dark too!

1X DinoWrestler Pankratops

A Solid going-2nd card. Serves as removal via attacking or its own effect. The flexibility this card offers is frankly amazing, despite is lack of a dark attribute of level of 8...

&nbsp;

1x Phantom Skyblaster

Often times, this is a 1 card Link 3, which will often serve as a form of targeted monster removal and an attacker. Dark attribute is good too. It is however, the deck's 7th normal summon, which is pushes the boundary for normal summon only monsters a little bit.

&nbsp;

1x Battle Fader

It has dark dynergy and is enables counter-attack plays that can result in victory. It is outclassed by Gizmek Orochi for what it does, however.

MAIN DECK - SPELLS

3x Pot of Desires

A +1 in card advantage whose cost synergizes with 9 of our monsters - auto include

&nbsp;

3x Allure of Darkness

Card advantage neutral, but has has synergy Necroface, serving as a way to rip apart your opponents deck and eventually boost Gren (or another Necroface). We play 17 dark monsters, to it is sometimes viable to activate this card with no dark monsters In hand, and is rarely dead otherwise.

&nbsp;

3x Forbidden Chalice

One of the best cards in the deck. Since we kind of want the opponent to go off on Turn 0, we don't mind too much on mission out on playing Effect Veiler instead. This card also enables some combat tricks, allowing a Gizmek Orochi to attack over a Radian, a Necroface to get over a boss monster, etc. Also, on the off-chance that magic cylinder is a great card in Common Charity format, this can very well save you from your own Gren... Also good in the mirror (should that ever be a thing you encounter)

&nbsp;

3x Dark Hole

The expectation is never for this card to lead to an OTK, but is is a very good way to punish out opponents for not setting up a solid board Turn 0. Occasionally, this may blow your opponent out, but most of the time, against competent decks, this card will be part of the sequence of plays you make to attrite your opponent into the ground by the mid game.

&nbsp;

1x Monster Reborn

This card enables all sorts of situational plays. It is arguable that Upstart Goblin is better in this slot.

&nbsp;

1x Gold Sarcophagus

In a long game, ensuring that you see a Necroface eventually, can be the difference between winning and losing. Occasionally can lead to banishing some good stuff out of your opponent's deck via this play. Can also get any card in the deck if you figure it'll be good in 2 turns.

&nbsp;

1x Called by the Grave

We want to have offensive turns with this deck, relying on activated abilities of monsters and spells. This card is good at protecting against hand traps, as well as disrupting resources in the opponent's GY.

&nbsp;

1x Foolish Burial

Basically Gizmek Orochi #4. If ever make a rank 8 XYZ with this build, if will probably involve this card.

&nbsp;

MAIN DECK - TRAPS

3x Typhoon

Admittedly, this card is not as good as twin twisters of Cosmic Cyclone - or even MST in some cases. However, I don't this deck is well suited for Twin Twisters (despite Gizmek synergy), and snake-boi Divine Serpent Geh will likely cost us 4000 Life Points for its first activation, adding some risk to Cosmic Cyclone that i'd personally rather avoid. Really, this is a symptom of the bigger issue here: there are not enough playable level 8s for this deck. We would happily leave Geh behind for a competent level 8 - then we could even dump some of the sacky spell cards for Trade In!

Spells enable this deck to function. Anti-Spell Fragrance and Imperial Order will prevent us from breaking a well set up board time and time again. Typhoon will always out those cards, and has situational advantages against field spell decks.  Cosmic Cyclone is in the Side deck if you really need it.

EXTRA DECK

3x Linkuriboh

You can make this card with Eater when situations come up where that is advantageous, so try to always leave 1 in your extra deck during gameplay. You can also make this with Battle Fader

&nbsp;

3x Ra'Ten, The Heavenly General

Phantom Skyblaster goes into this card, and then you blow something up with it. 2 of these copies are banish fodder. This card allows you to target and destroy a card at the start of the battle phase,

&nbsp;

3x Steel Star Regulator

An Objectively Worse Ra'Ten. Banish Fodder

&nbsp;

3x Number 62: Galaxy Eyes Prime Photon Dragon

Can get up to 5600 atk on its own and can serve as a situational out to certain cards, if ypou can make this rank 8 play

3x Aegaion The Sea Castum

We need to banish something from the extra deck to summon Eater of Millions and it might as well be this. Can serve as a situational wall/removal, and if your opponent's extra deck is running out you might hit a payoff... or something.

SIDE DECK

1x Macro Cosmos &amp; Dimensional Fissure

If you're going to be forced to go 1st, might as well play cards that make your deck better (despite lost Gizmek Value), and probably make your opponent's deck much worse.

&nbsp;

2x Trap Trick

If your going to go 1st, might as well have 2 more copies of Torrential Tribute and Banquet of Millions in your Deck

&nbsp;

3x Torrential Tribute

One of the best traps in the game and right in line with the deck's plan to induce resource depletion for the opponent. Just know your matchups so you know when to use it.

&nbsp;

2x Banquet of Millions

If forced to go 1st when wen don't want to, this matchup dependent card can ensure that we see out next turn, at which point our gameplan resumes as normal.

&nbsp;

2x Dark Ruler No More

When you know you want to go 2nd and the matchup will inevitably be a grind, or you know that your opponent's board will be very difficult to break.

&nbsp;

3x Cosmic Syslone

Useful for whenever Typoon alone is insufficient.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

HOT TAKES

TRADE IN

So Close... If you're willing to play Schwartzchild Limit Dragon and perhaps another lv 8, you can replace Divine Serpent Geh and some spells for lv8s and some number of Trade Ins. Right now, I think Gizmek Orochi is the only Level 8 worth playing, which is a shame. Gren can't afford to sit with a dead Trade In in hand, and you don't need the ordeal of trading an optimal Gizmek play on your opponent's turn for that pseudo +1 from pitching it with trade In. We just need more playable lv8s. Of course, you do you... I'm Projecting here.

POT OF DUALITY

Not for me... I've never liked this card in Gren. I think Gren plays a sub-optimal stun strategy, and losing your ability to have a maximally explosive turn at any point in the game seems like an anit-synergy to me. I'd rather run something like Upstart Goblin and just hope I banish it every time..."

The aim of the deck is to put up interruptions with the Springans cards (Interluder, Blast, and Captain Sargus), and then support those with Mirrorjade or Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. The most common play to make with the field spell and a Springans monster in hand is to activate Gold Golgonda, pitch the Springans monster, summon Merrymaker and depending on what you pitched with Gold Golgonda the combo can branch out:

Branga
<ul>
 	<li>Send anything other that Branga to GY with Merrymaker</li>
 	<li>Activate Branga effect in GY banishing both Springan's monsters</li>
 	<li>Search Interluder or Blast as an interruption</li>
</ul>
Captain Sargus
<ul>
 	<li>Send Brothers to GY with Merrymaker</li>
 	<li>Activate Brothers to Summon Captain Sargus from GY</li>
 	<li>Activate Brothers to attach it as material to Merrymaker, giving Sargus a pop on your opponents turn</li>
</ul>
DPE is is a little more reliable than Mirrorjade at times because, going second you will most likely use Mirrorjade's banish effect which means it is just a body on your oppoenets turn. In comparison DPE can always pop cards. The advantage Mirrorjade has is its ability to send Albion from the Extra Deck to the GY to search Judgement of Stigmata or sending Sprind the Irondash Dragon which allows you search or summon a Springans or Fallen of Albaz.

The deck is fully equip to go second. It features 8 hand traps. Ash and Impermanence are a must in my opinion. If you fix some of the ratios, Gamma fits well into the deck because the Springans XYZ can banish themselves on your opponents turn, leaving you with no monsters on the field which allows you to activate Gamma. Ghost Ogre can be replaced by Veiler. They are both Light meaning they can be used to summon Albion if that situation ever occurs. I chose Ghost Ogre because although it doesn't negate, it takes bodies off the field and it is useful against field spells which tend to generate advantage. Fallen of Albaz is great going second because it forces your opponent to make a decision which can bait out negates or handtraps. Furthermore, its basically the only normal summon in a deck that isn't reliant on the normal summon, so it being negated doesn't cripple the strategy. Lastly, Exblowrer is great going second if you can get material under it.

&nbsp;

The main gist of this homebrew format is that you start with a designated non-effect main deck monster on the board (either a normal monster or non-effect ritual monster) that cannot be tributed, cannot attack the opponent directly, cannot be used as the cost of another card's effect, cannot be turned face down, can't be taken control of, can switch between attack and defense position and takes damage in both attack and defense position. The concept is somewhat borrowed from Cardfight! Vanguard in that its a monster that remains on the board at all times and represents the player.

&nbsp;

This is designed to be a multi-man format (akin to Commander in MTG), hence why i have cards like The Forceful Sentry and Painful Choice allowed despite otherwise being banned in the OCG and TCG since i feel like they do a good job of encouraging negotiations between different players since you have to first designate which opponent you'll use a card's effect on in 3+ man games.

&nbsp;

When selecting the monsters for your main deck, you can only pick monsters that share either the same attribute and/or the same monster type as your vanguard. For example, i can put any dark and/or cyberse monsters in the main deck because Suppression Collider is a dark cyberse monster."

The Tellarknight archetype is build to mainly counter Dark and 9/10 times should be winning that matchup, the only Dark deck in the meta right now that would be a bit of a grind game would be against PK. Non dark decks are not hard to out but it but it becomes more of a game of timing also Anaconda isn't just a pay 2000 to special summon using its effect to make one of your opponents cards dark is really strong and opens up super poly plays. The DPE engine helps speed up the deck Dasher allows you to be able to special summon a Teller during the draw phase and Celestial allows you to go +2 in the standby phase after using Dasher while DPE helps you put more pressure on your opponent. The side deck is build to out meta and non dark decks the small Artifact engine can apply a lot of pressure on your opponent as you play traps in the deck and they are going to side things to hit your traps and if they hit a Artifact you gain even more advantage. any questions just common and ill try to answer them asap."

<hr />

<strong>Choice of cards in the main deck explained: </strong>

<strong>-A lot of Spellcasters</strong>, literally half the deck (20/40) consists of spellcasters including the handtraps.

<span>10x Witchcrafter monster cards (I go more in depth with them in my pure build #shameless_plugin)  +  8x Witchcrafter spell cards. </span>

<span>Good hands are when you <strong>don't</strong> open Haine and Verre, lucking illusion of chaos the new inclusion can fix your hand while also providing you with a starter. </span>The most ideal opening start would be to open the <a data-name=""Branded Fusion""><strong>Branded Fusion</strong>, this card would fusion summon </a><a data-name=""Albion the branded dragon""><strong>Albion the branded dragon</strong> which on summon can allow you to fusion summon </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Vice-master ""><strong>Witchcrafter Vice-master</strong> by banishing the required material from GY/hand or field. To summon Albion, you send </a><em><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> + 1 Light monster</em>, by sending a light Witchcrafter you can satisfy 1/2 the required materials for Vice-master. Once Vice-master is on the field, you can activate its effects and setup your field, the only restriction the Branded Fusion causes is not allowing you to special summon from the Extra Deck except Fusions, so nothing too harsh. Ideally you want to end your board with either <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine""><strong>Witchcrafter Haine</strong> as your (psuedo-Drident) and/or </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Madame Verre""><strong>Witchcrafter Madame Verre</strong> for disruption. </a>

<strong>-Ash blossom&amp; joyous spring</strong>, as a hand-trap, remains the most popular option of choice for its versatility, but I choose to cut for both <strong><a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a></strong><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Effect Veiler&quot;&gt;Effect Veiler&lt;/a&gt; and Droll &amp; Lock Bird""> and </a><strong><a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a></strong> as viable options, especially in the current meta; they also are favored for being spellcasters. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Psy-Framegear Gamma&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Psy-Framegear Gamma</strong></a> <strong>+ <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a></strong><a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver""> are in the deck to make sure your spells go through and the activated effects of the Witchcrafters card are not negated. In case of a disruption on your turn, we have a single copy of <strong>Called by the grave</strong> and 2 copies of </a><strong><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent </a></strong><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">for recovery and follow-up.</a>

<strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">-Magicians' Souls </a></strong>+ <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos""><strong>Illusion of Chaos</strong>, are a compact package that allows you to thin the deck/fix your hand/and draw cards with souls, this engine can be made more consistent with the inclusion of </a><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Preparation of Rites&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Preparation of Rites</strong></a>. [<em>Beginner Tip: Illusion of chaos can place itself on the top of the deck in a pinch, but keep in mind once you special summon souls, you send from deck to GY and then <strong>shuffle</strong>.</em>]

That should make the main deck clear, honestly learning to play well with the Witchcrafter portion of the deck is probably the most important thing for its success, just to give you the main idea, you want to <em><strong>blink</strong></em> from any <strong>Witchcrafter</strong> &gt; <strong><a data-name=""Schmietta"">Schmietta</a> &gt; <a data-name=""Genni"">Genni &gt; </a></strong><a data-name=""Genni"">ending on either </a><strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine </a></strong><a data-name=""Genni"">or </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter Madame Verre"">Witchcrafter Madame Verre. In the GY, </a><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-name=&quot;chmietta&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chmietta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;""><strong>S</strong></a><a data-name=""chmietta""><strong>chmietta</strong></a><a data-name=""chmietta""> can send any Witchcrafter spell card for </a><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Genni&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Genni</strong> </a>to copy its effect: <strong>[</strong><em>Best card to use with Genni in GY is  <strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter confusion"">Witchcrafter confusion</a></strong> for a fusion summon/ <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Witchcrafter Holiday&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Witchcrafter Holiday</strong></a> for recovery / <strong><a data-name=""Witchcrafter creation"">Witchcrafter Creation</a></strong> to fetch <strong><a data-name=""Golem Aruru"">Golem Aruru</a></strong></em> to hand for disruption<strong>]</strong>. If only Schmietta is in grave the best thing to probably send by its GY effect is probably <strong><a data-name=""Bystreet"">Bystreet</a>, </strong>for protection. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Draping&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Draping</strong></a> is for specifically countering <strong><a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>, </strong>but it can be used for multiple other targets that may come up.

<hr />

<span><strong>Extra Deck:</strong></span>

<strong>-Fusion</strong> <strong>line-up:</strong> of <strong>6</strong> <strong><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></strong> <em>fusion targets</em> and 2 of the <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;vice-master&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>vice-master</strong></a> herself, the ratios can be adjusted and experimented with this is what I am comfortably running currently. Albion the Branded dragon is what you summon off of branded fusion going first, as this almost always guarantees successfully summoning vice-master. If you feel like high rolling, <strong>Lubellion the Searing Dragon </strong>is your target by sending Haine/Illusion of Chaos and Albaz to GY, activate <strong><a data-name=""Lubellion"">Lubellion</a></strong>'s on summon effect to discard one LIGHT monster from hand specifically to special summon <strong>Albion the Branded </strong>which will banish the Haine and Albaz to give you <strong>Vice-master, </strong>and ending with 3 monsters on field. [<em><strong>NOTE:</strong> you are locked from summoning from the Extra deck only fusion monsters.]</em>

<strong>-1 level 8 synchro monster: </strong>this can basically be any monster as it seldom comes up, but the theory behind <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Psy-framelord Omega&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Psy-Framelord Omega</strong></a> is that it allows you recover your banished cards. The only way to make this monster is with Gamma + Driver, but you maybe don't wanna make a synchro summon at all as it conflicts with Branded Fusion's summoning condition.

<strong>-Link line-up: </strong>

<strong><a data-name=""Artemis, the magistus"">Artemis, the Magistus </a></strong><a data-name=""Artemis, the magistus"">allows you to send any Witchcrafter normal summon to the grave when you want to activate their graveyard effects but don't want to ditch a spell, that is basically the limit of its function.</a>

<strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda </a></strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">is an auto inclusion to most decks that fusion summon these days, however we are not using it nefariously to summon DPE or Dragoon, but to access Vice-masters by using either </a><a data-name=""Witchcrafter confusion"">Witchcrafter confusion</a> or <a data-name=""Magicalized fusion"">Magicalized fusion</a>. <strong>Branded fusion</strong> is a terrible option with this monster as you can't special summon at all afterwards. This monster is also very helpful with <strong>Super polymerization.</strong>

<b><a data-name=""Lambda"">Lambda</a>, </b>is to allow you to use Psy-Framegear gamma in hand when you have an already established field consisting of monsters.

<b><a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> &gt; <a data-name=""Selene"">Selene</a> &gt; <a data-name=""Accesscode talker"">Accesscode talker</a> OTK. </b>This combo can be made with any 2 monsters including a tuner, currently only effect Veiler but you can steal a tuner with Triple tactics talents if needed, this allows you summon effect veiler from deck and then link climb into a link-3 Selene, that special summons the same effect veiler from GY or any spellcasters you have really; Link climb again into Accesscode talker with 5300 attack and 2 pops on the field. <em><strong>[</strong>Tip: Accesscoder made this way will have 5300 atk + 2700 atk that vice-master has will = 8000 LP<strong>]</strong> GG EZ.</em>

<hr />

<strong>PROS:</strong>

The branded engine adds consistency and power, while the pure variant plays a slower control style of build, this deck is more aggressive and combo oriented. Illusion of chaos is basically additional copies of magicains' souls which almost always found place in the deck. Going second, people have few answers to super polymerization and dark ruler no more, essentially you can go for an OTK almost all the time. The playstyle of the deck is essentially vice-master turbo, the card is a house, it's function is to stop your opponent from making a board to counter yours, Haine supports vice-master by target protection, Golem Aruru protects it from battle, and bystreet protects it from destruction. The rest of the tools in the deck are for consistency and to ensure you end on Vice-master.

<strong>CONS:</strong>

This deck relies heavily on vice-master which in itself, lacks built-in protection and negates. Also it losses heavily to the sideboard. Even though Albaz adds a lot to the deck, it is much more stronger in other decks that build powerful turn one negates. Witchcrafters, even though I love them a lot, minus a lot with their current mechanic; which while it is interesting playstyle, stops it from ever reaching meta status."

https://youtu.be/f2Pi7nMvMf4

Targets for negate are Invoked and utopia double.
If i sp summon Ascended/Armed sage and normal summon Alisteir and the opponent negate the eff of Alisteir then i summon utopia double, the opponent use negate eff again but i chain with utopia double. If i used Ascended sage then i summon number 39, after c39 and then dragner. If i used Armed sage then i summon directly utopia leo ray
if the opponent use negate effect for 3rd time in same turn then i can summon utopia lightning or wait the perfect moment (maybe bp) in his turn (utopia double quick eff) to summon utopia dragonic.
If there is no negates and he use just nibiro against me, after nibiro resolves i can summon Mechaba. So i will have mechaba and token with crazy atk.
This strategy can work against the most common cards such as veiller, impermanence, nibiro, etc...

With onomatopaira and Ascended/Armed sage i can end on board:
-If he use 1 negate against me then my board will be with ascended sage: dragner ,leo utopia ray, abyss dweller and in his turn i will summon number 22 or 41.
-if he use 2 negates then my board is: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonik.
-if he use 3 negates: my board: utopia double + Zubababancho and i will chain him in his turn with utopia double to summon dragonic (i can use the eff of bancho the next turn if he is still alive also).
-if i used armed sage instead ascended sage, for 1 negate: dragner (i prefer to summon directly leo but i mention it because u can summon both dragner and leo), leo utopia ray, abyss dweller .
-for 2 negates: utopia double + abyss dweller or number 41 and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik.
-for 3 negates: utopia double + Zubababancho (i can use the eff the next turn) and in his turn i will chain him with utopia double to summon dragonik.
-if i want to play safe and avoid nibiro i will just summon Ascended/Armed sage + Utopic Onomatopoeia and then utopia double and then directly utopia leo ray and the next turn i will have follow ups in my hand.

Why i use number 101?
-if i am in bad position and i need to clear the field but the opponent is with monster 3000atk+ then i use number 101, i attack and i use the eff to stay alive, then i summon Zeus and i clear the field. Number 101 is helpful in many situations.

BRICKS (pegasus, double or nothing) SOLUTIONS:
-Double or nothing: go directly with Ascended sage to number 39 ,after c39 ,dragner and etc. With Armed sage instead go to number 41 in defense or go to number 39 - c39 - utopia lightning +tornado.
-Pegasus: use Ascended sage for utopia double - number 39 - c39 - dragner - number 22 and in the opponent turn u can summon number 41 in defense after u resolved all your effects.
-If u draw tornado or hyper rank up magic, is not big deal  because they can be used from the hand, just keep in mind to use Armed Sage for utopia double and (if the opponent use negate eff or not) then add pegasus in hand and chain with utopia double- summon dragonic and equip tornado to him, after use the eff of dragonic to equip pegasus from your hand.
-Note: if u are second, in every case try to attack with number 39 (+ double or nothing) and win the duel.

-The deck is good going first/second also.
-If u going first u have chance to open Aleister, Meltdown, Onomatopaira, Onomatopickup: 85% + pots = 92%.
-If u going first u have chance to open Astral kuriboh, Ascended/Armed sage (+searchers): 82% +pots = 90%
-if u going second and the opponent have a very strong board, u can destroy that board by forbiden dropplet + dark ruler and u can give him a hard time with Forbidden Chalice: 71% chance to open + pots = 85%

The Dogmatika engine is simple and effective and brings nice synergies with the archetype because as you use <a data-name=""Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la"">Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la</a> then you can simply send an <a data-name=""Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny"">Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny</a> to the gy and use it as a removal opponent's cards even if you don't control any Evil★Twin monster. It's also because of the Dogma engine that I've decreased the number of Link-2 Evil★Twin in the extra deck.
On other decklist choices: What do I think of <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>? Crossout is a bad vibes card in the sense that it does the same thing as <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> but worse for the need to use targets that need to be in your deck and I believe that not any deck can use it because it benefits a lot decks that have room for multiple tech cards like this one but not decks that have a very small space so it's better to focus on using other cards. Speaking of main deck targets, <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> is the main one because there are no ways to play around it with this archetype and only use 1-off because Nibiru conflicts with Evil★Twin's and this problem has already cost me games so I don't find one Very good card to use and I already have two bricks which are the main deck Evil★Twins and <a data-name=""Fleurdelis"">Fleurdelis</a> and I don't want this number to increase. Another caveat I want to make is the use of <a data-name=""Enemy Controller"">Enemy Controller</a> because it is a budget option for the <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> but if you have the Droplet I recommend using it without thinking twice because it excels in this deck and makes your Crossout Designator much better .
About the extra deck I see that many players don't use <a data-name=""Sky Cavalry Centaurea"">Sky Cavalry Centaurea</a> but rather the <a data-name=""Gachi Gachi Gantetsu"">Gachi Gachi Gantetsu</a> and I think its use is due to a budget option because Sky Cavalry is much better in the role of accessing <a data-name=""AA-Zeus"">AA-Zeus</a> by the factor of be able to bounce an opponent's monster in the battle phase and there are monsters like <a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin"">Lyrilusc - Ensemblue Robin</a> that you don't want to send to the GY at all, but banish or return to the extra deck. Another card that is not used much is the <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh </a>which in this version has the fundamental role of versus Tri-Brigade you have the Normal Summon of a Live☆Twin Ki-sikil for example denied and then you do Linguriboh to negate the <a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Revolt"">Tri-Brigade Revolt</a> and then Next you activate <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> to clear the rest of the opponent's field.
Regarding the Side Deck one change I would make would be to use <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package. Regarding spell/trap removal I like the 7 used and <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> is justified in this deck because you have very easy access to AA-Zeus of 4 materials so you will hardly get punished for using Red Reboot and not getting all of your opponent's traps of field.
These are all the ideas I bring with this decklist for you to make changes."

The deck seems to never brick on me and honestly U DONT EVEN NEED RAPTOR CALL,  (just ruins any type of combo with phantom knights into any xyz dragons)

If your going 1st do the basic verte into dragun, and getting into ultimate falcon a rank10 is ezaf, honestly if your struggling on 1st turns, swap out raptor calls for readiness if you open with mimicry send it to the grave yard once u link or xyz  and  search for it and or if you open with tribute lanius send it to the grave yard from your deck to search for it too, its pretty much a end turn if you only control raptors.

I prefer 2 rank ups cause u can pull of a crazy double rank up into a 2x destroy monster on field or 1 back row  and1 monster,( i prefer going for back row combo because your tryna bait any type of negate or quick effect, if they activate  and still have alot of back row cards use phantom rank up into satellite cannon and wipes entire back row. You can also change to 1x silent boost having two is just in case you draw one (u need them in your deck for the effect of phantom knight rusty)

not so many key cards in this deck, you can pull crazy field wipes with pretty much anything but best ones are:

-strangle lanius : If you can, DONT use him at all in any of the early links or xyz summons try and keep him on the field to use his special Summon effect later.

-mimicry : to search for whats missing so you can carry on the flood summon or readiness( this deck lets you get ur main cards to combo all most always ) pretty much a raptors nest ( i recommend to search for a pain lanius because you cannot search summon him with the links or xyz effects once you start to combo)

Combo best hand to open with going 2nd:

1x (trap monster) shade of brigandine,  1x strangle lanius, 1x pain lanius, 1x caligo claw, 1x tribute lanius and u can pretty much have any other card

4                                               2                        4                                       4

you would set then summon your trap shade of brigandine, special summon caligo, strangle lanius , normal summon tribute lanius activate his effect to send mimicry to GY activate mimicry to search for singing lanius, use pain lanius and caligo to link into Rr-wise trix his effect will activate to special summon, Choose raiders wing his effect is negated for now.

link2

4                                             4                                       4negated

Use raiders wing and [ tribute lanius] to xyz in to Rr-force trix, activate his effect detach RAIDERS WING  to add lv4 to hand choose what ever you  want all ready got em all, wise trix affect activates choose rank-up soul shave to set, activate raiders wing in the GY to special summon using the material on force trix, then special summon singing lanius from hand.

link2

rank4                                        4                                        4                                        4

Use link 2 and rank 4 to Link into Phantom knight rusty and if you can choose where to place plz pick the left (dont be braindead) activate rusty's affect to send silent boost to GY ; which will let you add a phantom knight spell/trap (choose trap monster  if you didnt  open with his affect at the starting) choose rank-up magic force, then you can banish silent boost to do the same, choose magic launch( if you chose the trap the 1st time chose magic force the 2nd). Activate rank-upasuru soul shave on force trix (obviously) to xyz out lv6 revolution falcon(dont be braindead put him in a link zone) rustry's effect will activate to let you destroy any card on the field go for back rows to bait any negates or continues trap/spells, then use revolution falcon to destroy 1 enemy monster.

link3

rank6                                         4                                          4                                      4

If hes back row decking use rank upsuru magic force to xyz into satellite falcon wipe entire back row it CANNOT BE NEGATED and they cant activate any card effect  lol cry kid, u can now activate strangle lanius to special summon from the GY just choose mimicry, now u can use mimicry and strangle lanius to xyz into either

- blaze falcon to wipe all enemy special summoned monsters if you cannot otk with arc rebellion

-arc rebellion to big ppk and negate face up monster affects

If they have a big pp beat down monster before activating arc rebellion , using the last two lv4s link into verte and bring out the cancer kid destroyer dragun and destroy his big pp beat stick with his effect, then you can activate arc rebell to destroy him for 11,100 LOL ,if he has a 3000 - 5000k beat down activate satellite cannon to remove 800 atk points for every raidraptor in Gy LOLOLOL about 4000k LOLOL( arc rebellions affect is increased from the ORIGINAL DAMAGE of all special summoned)

link3 rusty

rank8 satellite                       link2 verte                     rank5 arc Reb                      lv8dragun

If you chose to special summon balze falcon even after going verte into dragun you have more than enough to end it 9100 total atk.

if hes got beat down stick that cannot be targeted by card effects, xyz into ultimate falcon ([unaffected by other card effects] which lets his effects work on things like chaos max or dragun etc)

this is only a friendly fun ez to use flood deck, problems i get into is GY negates and  apollousa theres so many searches and special summons it doesnt even affect the flow most of the time .

This is my very own Satellarknight Zefra list!  It's mainly an XYZ spam deck that seeks to control the board with Triverr while also increasing consistency through a Zefra engine, all while accruing advantage through redundant search effects or bounce effects.  While this deck isn't the most competitive deck on the planet, it is <em>incredibly</em> fun to play, so I thought I'd share it with you all!

<span><em>THE ENGINES;</em></span>

The Zefra cards serve 3 purposes: 1) to prove scales to more easily assemble the necessary materials for a Tellarknight XYZ monster while still triggering main deck Tellarknight monster effects, 2) to increase consistency through Zefraath, Oracle and Providence by either searching up Pendulum Scale pieces <em>or</em> searching other Tellarknight monsters (Zefraxciton and Zefrathuban) for XYZ plays, and 3) to provide a going-first control package with Zefraniu, Nine Pillars, Divine Strike, and War.  Zefraath is a key card here - I've never actually summoned it since you only want it in the Pendulum Scale.  It allows us to dump a Zefra monster (usually Zefraniu going first and later Zefrathuban or Zefraxciton for extending plays) to the extra deck to copy that monster's Pendulum Scale rating.  Assuming we have the opposite Scale set as well, we'll be able to Pendulum Summon that monster; however, since Zefraath's normal Scale is 5, it is very easy to Pendulum Summon our Tellarknight monsters if this effect doesn't go through.

The main deck Tellarknight cards provide consistency, either by searching Scales or follow-up cards with Deneb, dumping Tellarknight monsters in grave with Unukalhai, or by recurring Tellarknight monsters in grave for XYZ plays with Altair.  Vega is good for extending if our Scales don't survive our opponent's turn (although they should due to Providence's in-grave effect) while Alsham gives us access to burn damage if the game is running into time, or we just need an easy finisher.  Keep in mind that all these effects trigger if the Tellarknight monster is Summoned - not just Normal or Special Summoned, but also Pendulum Summoned (hence the value of the Zefra engine).

The extra deck Tellarknight cards are how we win the game.  We usually want to win with Triverr, since it bounces every card on the field other than itself, then let's us discard a card from our opponent's hand, essentially letting us dismantle our opponent's board while (hopefully) discarding any cards they could use for a follow-up play. The hidden power of Triverr is in bouncing <em>our own</em> cards to the hand.  Our board, usually being Oracle of Zefra and Pendulum cards in the Scales, is easily rebuildable, plus we can get repeated activations from a single copy of Oracle, allowing us to set up for next turn.  Plus, Triverr brings back a Tellarknight monster if it's destroyed.  Delteros is spot removal that can float if destroyed while providing protection for us when we Summon monsters.  Constellar Diamond is easy to go into and is a floodgate on a stick against certain decks that want to dump things to the grave or recur cards from the grave to the hand.  The negation effect doesn't always come up, but when it does, it is very powerful.  Batlamyus is there to get us into these three monsters easier if we only have 2 Tellarknight monsters to summon.

<em><span>OTHER CARDS:</span></em>

Ash Blossom and Imperm are here for negations - feel free to change these to adapt to your meta as you see fit.

Terraforming and RotA are here for more consistency - we want to see Oracle, and RotA can grab almost every one of our main deck monsters.

Satellarknight Skybridge - an interesting tech that I like to run.  Essentially swaps a Tellarknight on field with a Tellarknight in deck, which is useful if we need to get some advantage from a monster about to be destroyed <em>or</em> if we draw a dead Tellarknight monster and want something more useful.  Just remember you're locked into summoning Tellarknight monsters for that turn.  Could be shaved/replaced for some of the other cards in the ""Things I've Been Messing With"" section.

The Link Monsters - Gravity Controller is here to get rid of a monster stuck in the extra monster zone (usually a Pendulum Summoned monster), clearing it out for another Pendulum Summon if need be.  It doesn't come up every game, but you'll definitely love the card when it does come up.  I:P, Unicorn, and Borrelsword are good value cards/finishers in the deck, and are easy to make since we can spam lots of monsters.

Abyss Dweller, Bagooska, and Gallant Granite - These are just good XYZ monsters for the deck.  Dweller is a floodgate and really hurts some decks, Bagooska buys us time if we brick, and Granite can search up Zefraath.

<span><em>LINES OF PLAY</em></span>

There aren't really any set combos in the traditional sense here; rather, the deck is consistently trying to get to certain end goals.  Whichever way you do that is dependent on what's in your hand.  Usually, you want to get you Scales set up and have some sort of play for next turn.

So for example, take the following hand: [Deneb, Zefrathuban, Providence, Ash Blossom, and Alsham].

If we are going first, we could search Oracle with Providence, play Oracle, grab Zefraath, activate Zefraath and Zefrathuban in the Scales, activate Zefraath sending Zefraniu, Pendulum Summon Zefraniu and Deneb, search with Zefraniu and Deneb, grab Nine Pillars and Altair, Normal Summon Alsham, burn for 1000 then XYZ summon Bagooska or Dweller.

If we are going second, we could search Oracle with Providence, play Oracle, grab Zefraath, activate Zefraath and Zefrathuban in the Scales, activate Zefraath sending Zefraxciton, Pendulum Summon Zefraxciton and Deneb, grab Altair, Normal Summon Alsham, burn for 1000 then XYZ summon Triverr, bouncing the field and giving us a second Oracle activation next turn in addition to Altair as a follow-up.

In both these examples, the important thing was setting the Scales - you usually want to do this if you can.  However, after this, we had a lot of branching pathways to get to different end boards depending on what we want to end our turn on.  This high degree of searchability is one of the strengths of the deck.

<span><em>THINGS I'VE BEEN MESSING WITH:</em></span>

To date, I've been playing around with some different packages/techs for the deck:

Utopia Package:  This is Number 39: Utopia, Number 39: Utopia Double, and Double or Nothing.  This is an alternate finisher for the deck.  Summon Utopia Double with two materials, then detach a material to add Double or Nothing from deck to hand and special Utopia onto Utopia Double, doubling Utopia's attack.  Then, you attack a monster with Utopia (since you can't attack directly due to Utopia Double's effect), negate the attack with Utopia, activate Double or Nothing, then attack again for massive damage.  I cut this due to lack of room in the extra deck, but it is a fun combo that I may try again later in the future.

King of the Sky Prison:  This is the addition of King of the Sky Prison and 2 Call of the Haunted.  Essentially, you go into Gallant Granite to search King, activate King, then pass the turn.  On the opponent's turn, you activate a Set card (usually Nine Pillars or Divine Strike), Special Summon King, then Set <em>any</em> extender/searcher you may need from the deck for next turn.  If you go into Triverr next turn, you can bounce the King and do it again next turn!  This one is pretty fun to pull off.

<span><em>CLOSING REMARKS:</em></span>

Hopefully this guide gives you a decent look into playing this deck.  As I've said before, it's not the most competitive deck out there, but it's really fun to play and is surprisingly more resilient than you might expect.

Thanks for taking a look at my build, and good luck with your duels!"

<a data-name=""Dinorphia Rexsturm"">Dinorphia Rexsturm</a> is really strong! Its the win conditon that the archtype needed!

I putted a Dogmatika engine here because the deck is slow, weak at going second and because Dogmatika have some interesting interactions with dinos.

One card combo: <a data-name=""Dinorphia Frenzy"">Dinorphia Frenzy</a>.

At the start of your opponent main phase- Activate Frenzy (4000LP) ~Fusion summon <a data-name=""Dinorphia Kentregina"">Dinorphia Kentregina</a> using 1 Dinorphia monster from your extra deck and another from you main deck ~Chain Kentregina quick effect to copy Frenzy effect (2000LP) ~Fusion summon Rexsturm using 1 Dinorphia from the extra deck and 1 from the main deck ~Now in the next time you activate a Dinorphia effect your life will be 1000,500 and so on, also <a data-name=""Rexsturm"">Rexsturm</a> will be negating passively almost all your opponent monster effects (to negate <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> you gonna need at lest one more Dinorphia effect). Keep im mind that <a data-name=""Rexsturm"">Rexsturm</a> also has a quick effect to make your opponent monsters atk equal your LP, so having less LP is aways a win=win.

You can summon <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a> in the first turn using <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a> effect to send 2 dinosaurs from your extra deck to the gy. Aka <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>+<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>.

Notes:

Floodgates dont work is this deck, except maybe for <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a>, but that just slows the deck even more.

<a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a>, <a data-name=""Extinction on Schedule"">Extinction on Schedule</a><a data-name=""Extinction Schedule"">,</a> <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike and other traps with burn effects</a> aren't worth using. Just no kill yourself.

After reaching 1 LP you will stop losing LP from your divisions but the effect of them still can be used. This also means that is impossible to <a data-name=""Rexsturm"">Rexsturm</a> to negate 0 atk monsters.

<a data-name=""Performage Damage Juggler"">Performage Damage Juggler</a> is good to not let you die to battle or effect damage. <a data-name=""Performage Hat Trick"">Performage Hat Trick</a> can be used against burn decks or if you need to xyz summon when going second.

If you're scared or don't know how to play around of <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> or <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> you can add second copie of Dinorphia Sonic.

&nbsp;

!Uptadate: i forgot adding <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> xD but now the deck have 41 cards ;-;

!Update2: just to clarify somethings. 1-i am not using <a data-name=""Dinorphia Stealthbegia"">Dinorphia Stealthbegia </a>because from my experience it is useless to less 2-i am not using <a data-name=""Dinorphia Reversion"">Dinorphia Reversion</a> because it can be just a brick sometimes and don't have a effect so good in my opinion, same for <a data-name=""Dinorphia Shell"">Dinorphia Shell</a>.

&nbsp;

Happy new year!

INTRODUCION:

First, does it make sense to upload a deck on old banlist?
Mhh for me it has sense, the stupid banlists took us too many great monsters, combos and decks.
Of course, I am not allowed to speak for the entire Yu-Gi-Oh community, but that's how my heart feels.
I've been working on this deck for a long time (between 2020/2021), unfortunately the first 2021 banlist crush this deck.
Of course I expected this and I was going to upload this deck earlier, but striving for perfection did not allow me finish.
The name of the deck is not accidental (""Drytron &amp; Perfection"") and I hope you will see it.

Provides a very good foundation for the future decks, especially if the banlist changes accordingly.

I know I didn't show many decks this year (in fact it will be the first), but I had reasons.
And I assure you that my love for Yu-Gi-Oh cards is not lost and never will be and I hope people can see this in most of my decks.
I'm just a sick man, and I shouldn't be sitting at the computer for a long time.
Unfortunately, building and tests a great decks (I hope they are great) sometimes takes a long time.
Deck in this form is very strong and hard to stop, but judge it for yourself.

Limited to one ""Cyber Angel Benten"" proper was a death sentence not only for this deck but also for many ritual decks especially cooperating with Drytron archetyp. Apparently KOMANI didn't want ritual decks to spread its wings.
But I know and I feel ritual decks give us many more great victories in the future not only in NO BANLIST competitions.
And I know that there will be people who will like this deck very much (those who swim against the tide) and for them I do this.
Ritual Monsters FOREVER ;)

&nbsp;

DECKLIST:

Now let's move to decklist. You must remember that this deck was created in January and then it was 100% up to date.
""Forbidden Droplet"" - may not be needed at times when ""Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL"" and ""True King of All Calamities"" are baned.
I think you could use instead 3 other cards. Triple Tactics Talent also is optional. Side deck there is only a suggestion. I wouldn't experiment with the rest deck
because I think it is optimized perfectly. But it's your decision (and I would make this decision based on opponent's deck).

TACTICS: (I will try to explain it simply so that everyone can understand especially newcomers).

Going first:

Of course at the beginning we should use ""Pot of Extravagance"" if we have him in hand (this also applies to further cards).
Next ""Cyber Emergency"" first effect and we add the card we need for combo (that of course will depend on what already we have in hand).
We use the second effect Cyber Emergency if necessary and we can discard for example Drytron monster whose effect we can use later in GY.
Next ""Drytron Fafnir"" we add the card we need for combo and as above.
And ""Preparation of Rites"" and this could be a very important moment, especially if we don't have yet ""Cyber Angel Benten"" im hand ;)
Next ""Pre-Preparation of Rites"" and this will be the second very important effect. And vs many hand trap, may turn out to be crucial.
Remember that if your opponent has for example use 3 hand traps cards it may not be necessary much, to block him in the next round.
One negate or Vanity's Ruler lock or both in the field, depending on the opponent's deck.
Also, keep in mind that some of these effects can be used repeatedly in 1 turn.

It is also prudent to use ""Drytron Alpha Thunban"" (if we use for tribute ""Cyber Angel Benten"")   in such a way as to add first ""Cyber Angel Benten"", and then add ""Herald of Perfection"" using effect ""Cyber Angel Benten"" in GY, because ""Cyber Angel Benten"" we usually need it much more ( it's such a small security vs hand trap in some situations).

&nbsp;

The tactic is very simple, consists in entering to the field: ""Herald of Perfection"" &amp; ""Vanity's Ruler"".
Enter Herald of Perfection quite quickly (to have something vs Nibiru for example or other hand traps).
Drytrons effects take place in hand or in a cemetery which makes this archetype resilient.
Obviously the main weapon of this deck (next to ""Vanity's Ruler"") are multiple negates.
And so that everything has hands and feet, we introduce Vanity's Ruler &amp; Herald of Perfection with one neat combo.
By the way(during comba), we add to your hand ""Vanity's Ruler"" &amp; ""Eva"" (to increase the number of negates +2).
You can also add too hand for example: ""Artifact Lancea"" or ""Herald of orange light"" or ""Herald of Green Light"" etc depending on the needs.
With good hands, we can also introduce strong link 4 or or higher or for example ""Knightmare Cerberus"" co-linked with Knightmare Phoenix for more fun from game hehe.

TIPS AND TRICKS:

There is another defense mechanism built into deck in case of cards such as ""Dark Ruler No More"" or ""Forbidden Droplet"". ""Herald of Perfection"" is negated, but not his cost. Therefore we can use
""Herald of Perfection"" and use his effect, of course we don't negate anything but the cost we will have to pay and we can use ""Eva"" as a cost then we use ""Eva"" effect to add 2 cards from the deck and we can add for example ""Herald of Orange Light"" vs monsters deck and use an atypical hand trap. In other situations you can also use it we just add other cards for example Herald of Green Light vs powerful spell and so on.

Going Second:

First, if they are in the field set spell/trap or continuous spell/trap (floodgates) we destroy them, we use ""Harpie's Feather Duster"" or ""Twin... cards in side deck.
And for some annoying effects I recommend good old ""Evenly Matched"" ;) OR/AND
We mainly use links and we systematically destroying the opponent's cards (relinquished anima, Geonator Transverser, Knightmare links or Avramax), depending on the needs. And of course ""Accesscode Talker"" for fast OTK.

SUMMARY:

Finally, I want to thank everyone who uses my decks and over a 1,5 million users ygoprodeck who watched my decks.
You have been with me since December 2019 and you were with me through a difficult 2020 year (difficult for me not through COVID).
I wants to dedicate deck for Oscar B. you will forever be in our hearts BRO.
Thank again and remember, play for fun, not always for win. If you always play for win you newer play for fun.

&nbsp;

But a hand of Gamma + Scythe + any Fluffal name is an almost 100% guarantee that you'll be able to use Gamma twice in the game. Gamma to negate an effect, Scythe to go into Cruel Whale, and then Cruel Whale pop Driver and an opponent's card. The deck isn't meta at all, but it's so much fun to play. You can push for a huge OTK during turns 2-4, but you're most likely gonna struggle beyond that.

&nbsp;

I don't think there's any really spicy tech options here, but the art for the Fluffals is very cute :)"

I feel like D-Barrier is a good option, especially with Swordsoul and Drytron kicking around right now. Floowandereeze is definitely a tough matchup though.

&nbsp;

I don't really think that 3 copies of Secret Village is the way to go, but running the Terraforming to search it is essentially 3 copies, and can thin your deck just a little bit. I also find that Strike, while a really good card, can be too detrimental in the late-game. I know that's a sign of a bad Geist player, so feel free to flame me.

&nbsp;

Lastly, I find that the Extra Deck monsters can be really helpful in the late game, especially if you can get to Hexstia pointing to Memorygant, so I run 2 Extrav. This decision has actually never screwed me over, at least not yet. I just find that being able to keep some stuff in the ED can help when you start getting to the grind game.

&nbsp;

IO and Summon Limit in the Side because, I mean, ya gotta run floodgates if you wanna win. It sucks, but what can you do? I have the 3rd Extrav in the side because I needed one more card in there, and I felt like I could switch it out for the Terraforming if I really needed to.

Mostly, I'm uploading this here to more easily check the TCG Player price, not gonna lie."
