monster on your opponent's side of the field as long as they can be tributed and so you will never be at a complete disadvantage going second because you can even draw this card in your draw phase turn 2 and it is still as useful where </span><b>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring </b><span>becomes essentially useless.</span></li>  	<li><b>This is the first card you side out if you are going first</b><span> and side back in because you want them in the main deck in case you get stuck going second you will have them as a possibility to save you from your opponents likely established board however if you win the First duel of the match you won't side them out or change anything with your deck generally unless you know a hand trap in your extra deck that affects your opponent more like </span><b>Artifact Lancea </b>would be more useful <span>but unlike these other Hand Traps </span><b>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</b><span> will not lose their effectiveness as often (like if your opponent does not use the thing you locked them out of using with a card like <b>Artifact Lancea</b>) because </span><b>most decks will have a monster on field </b><span>and you can remove it for essentially free.</span></li>  	<li><span>This card can shut down cards like </span><b>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</b><span> or </span><b>Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer (neither are in this

Now I've beed Naturia-pilled.  Camellia, Molecricket, Spring Breeze and Sacred Tree form the backbone of an extremely powerful yet unsassuming recursive strategies with the help of Vernalizers. You need to setup so Molecricket is in your GY, then you summon Camellia to dumps Sacred Tree from the deck which searches Spring Breeze, then you revive Molecricket and use it's effect to summon from deck Sunflower. This means your board consists of a repeatable monster negate (Sunflower thanks to Camellia's cost substitution effect), Molecricket can summon Horneedle to destroy anything your opponent special summons and even if you need monster to tribute, Molecricket revives itself to cover the cost. This is just the bare minimum of what the deck does, tho'. Now let's talk about Vernalizers...  Vernalizers pitch any monster from your hand along with themselves to use a specific effect and all revive any earth monster with the only condittion being getting locked into earth monster effects (but not summons, remember that). Essentialy ara a roundabout and costly way to summon monsters from your hand and deck. Forest is the best starter, since it's unique effect is foolish burial for any earth monsters but it won't be revived by its second effect. This translates to Foolish Burial King Regulus so you can revive it with your other Vernalizers. Hills searches any Vernalizer card, mostly the trap, which bounces any number of your opponent's cards as long as you can also bounce earth monsters (this also translates to the possibility of bouncing a Maxx ""C"" you summoned from the GY, but since this a TCG focused list we don't have to worry about that, sorry OCG). Finally, Seedlings adds you any earth fairy monster which means any of the other two Vernalizers. Since both, at the very least, set up your GY you still play them at three. I decided to play Mountains because it unbricks your hands full of Vernalizers, but it can be cut. Now, the real star of the Vernalizers is Vera. She is a Crackdown, Splight Elf and a monster negate (if you have 5 earth monsters on the field, which isn't uncommon) in one. She revives King Regulus during each of your opponent's turns. She is the second pillar of the deck (along with Camellia).  One extra note: remember how I mentioned that you're only locked into earth monster effects? This means that you can still summon Zeus or Baronne since you'll be using their effects during your opponent's turn anyway."

It's also nice to have a level 1 tuner that can summon itself, as on your turn after equipping it you can use it and the Buster Dragon to go into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss for a negate.</span>  <span>• Rokket Synchron: Just a good one-of, a solid normal summon and is also just another name for Boot Sector and Rokket Tracer.</span>  <span>• 2× Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: It's Ash, why wouldn't you run it?</span>  <span>• 1× White Dragon Wyverburster and 1× Black Dragon Collapserpent: Solid self-summons that search eachother and are targets for Chaos Space. </span>  <span>• 1× Rokket Recharger and 1× Silverrokket Dragon: Just good level 4's and once again just more names for Tracer and Boot Sector.</span>  <span>• 3× Rokket Tracer: The best Rokket in the deck. Targets a card to pop to summon another Rokket from deck, and is a level 4 tuner to allow for easy level 8 Synchros. </span>  <span>• 1× Starliege Seyfert: I run just 1 Seyfert for space reasons, and I just search for Collapserpent. The GY effect is also really useful for when you want something like Borreload or Chaos Ruler back in the ED. </span>  <span>• 1× Fallen of Albaz: This is your Hieratic summon target to go into Sprind.</span>  <span>• 2× Buster Blader the Destruction Swordsman: Buster Blader himself. I use the retrain because he has a better effect than the original, and I don't use Buster Whelps effect to summon it from the hand or Destruction Swordsman Fusion for the Super-Poly type effect. </span>  <span>• 1× Absorouter Dragon: It can special summon itself and has a great GY effect, not much else to say. Searches for your combo pieces, and is your main Foolish or Dragon Ravine target.</span>  <span>• 2× Noctovision Dragon: Another card with a really easy Special Summon, and goes +1 when sent to the GY for link material, which is just amazing. It can also protect your traps with it's first effect, but that doesn't come up very often.</span>  <span>• 1× Chaos Dragon Levianeer: A free pop-2 on summon, and also a big body on the field. It's also searchable through Chaos Space, which is nice.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>➥ Spells &amp; Traps</span>  <span>• 2× Chaos Space: This is mainly to search for Wyverburster or Collapserpent, but can also search for Levianeer if you want. The GY effect is also really nice. It applies to Extra Deck monsters too, as they can't be Normal Summoned/Set, so you don't need Wyverburster/Collapserpent banished for it to work. </span>  <span>• 1× Foolish Burial: This is to send Absorouter or Dragon Buster, whichever you want. It lets you skip a whole step in the combo process. </span>  <span>• 1× Dragon Ravine: Searchable through Romulus and can send Absorouter or Dragon Buster by discarding 1. The discard cost is also helpful sometimes, as you can send Memories if you hard drew it, or Absorouter / Dragon Buster if you drew those too.</span>  <span>• 1× Boot Sector Launch: Searchable through Striker Dragon and can put Rokkets on the field for free. Pretty self explanatory.</span>  <span>• 3× Quick Launch: A free summon from the Deck and it's not even once per turn. Insanely good as you can summon literally anything you need. </span>  <span>• 1× Called By The Grave: Just nice to have, can stop some handtraps or other plays if you banish the right card. </span>  <span>• 2× Destruction Sword Memories: This is to be sent by Prologue for it's GY effect to banish Fusion materials for the Buster Blader fusion.</span>  <span>• 3× Prologue Of The Destruction Swordsman: This 1 trap allows for a 2-turn monster lockdown. Send Memories and Buster Blader to grave, chain Memories and summon both the Buster Blader fusion and Buster Dragon to change all enemy monsters to Dragons. </span>  <span>• 2× Trap Trick: These serve as extra copies of either Prologue or Red Reign. That's about it</span>  <span>• Red Reign: A great field wipe that also protects your remaining monsters. It also comes back from the GY really easily, so it's constantly accessible. You can run Destruction Sword Flash instead of this if you want, but I prefer Red Reign because it's applicable more often, protects your monsters and comes back to your hand from the GY should a Dark Dragon be Sunchro Summoned (literally any Synchro in this deck). </span>  &nbsp;  <span>➥ Extra Deck: </span>  <span>• 2× Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman: Your main man, he locks down all Dragons, does piercing, and can easily reach super high ATK.</span>  <span>• 1× Sprind, the Irondash Dragon: your Albaz target after summoning him via Hieratic. Bounce 1 with Hieratic, yoink the other with Albaz to go into Sprind. </span>  <span>• 2× Busted Dragon: This card lets you lock down any opponent field even if they're not dragons, by forcing them into becoming dragons. It also equips Dragon Buster from grave to lock your opponents ED.</span>  <span>• 1× Borreload Savage Dragon: Pretty simple, the best generic Synchro in the game with a once per turn omni-negate and easy access to Link monsters in grave. </span>  <span>• 1× Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon: Mills and searches for extending potential on summon, and can come back from GY by banishing a Light and a Dark. Just a really solid level 8 to go into. </span>  <span>• 1× Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss: Once again just another really easy to access monster with a negate. It can also summon a tuner from grave after damaging your opponent, which can come up fairly often. </span>  <span>• 1× Guardragon Pisty: Sometimes useful, but you can cut it if you really want. Not really necessary but I have found I've needed it in very specific situations. </span>  <span>• 1× Striker Dragon: Searches for Boot Sector and can add a Rokket from grave to hand by popping itself. Pretty simple and really good.</span>  <span>• Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres: like a better version of Knightmare Unicorn. Bounces one and can summon Albaz from deck for another yoink. </span>  <span>• 1× Dragunity Knight - Romulus: Searches Dragon Ravine on summon, and its second effect can come up every once in a while. Once again pretty simple</span>  <span>• 1× Quadborrel Dragon: This is for when you don't have the best hand or misplay. 1 Rokket Tracer can become a 2-negate Borreload Savage because of this card. And once again the discard cost is kinda nice sometimes. </span>  <span>• 1× Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman: It can help sometimes when you misplay because its materials are generic, but it also serves as a way to garuntee Dragon Buster or Memories is in the GY.</span>  <span>• 1× Borrelsword Dragon: I like it more than Accesscode, and it fits the Rokket theme as it's in-archetype, plus it's got really good OTK potential. </span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span>Its a lot, but it's a deck with a LOT of tiny moving parts you need to keep track of, but it's very very fun regardless.</span>"

Swordsoul monsters with the maindeck Tenyis enable numerous synchro summons and pushes into established boards. Deck can go first or second really well and can play through numerous disruptions. Deck count is pretty high but I think this deck doesn't mind the large deck size due to its overall consistency. Extra deck is kind of standard I think but Dragite is my ""flex spot"". Could be Crimson Blader, Psychic End Punisher, or Draco Masters of the Tenyi potentially. Side deck is subject to change based on metagame and things I want to try, mostly trying to focus on ""board breaking"" going 2nd cards. Flex spot would be the ghost mourners I suppose but they're decent against token collector. Other options could be Forbidden Chalice or Rivalry of Warlords  Any constructive criticism or suggestions welcome!"

I WISH YOU WOULD.","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, it's been a long time since I last uploaded a deck list and that's because I've been in a bit of a hiatus from Yu-Gi-Oh, considering how stale the meta is with all the Sky Striker overhype due to YCS Hartford, but regardless I'm back with a new list that I've been testing as soon as I caught wind that they've received a new wave of support, Naturias.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>Well, the top decks nowadays are consisted of decks that are reliant on mostly Spell effects to get their stuff started because that's just the nature of Fusion decks (and it kinda hurts me that I'm forming a strategy against them, but I digress), also considering all the Brave and Therions stuff still floating all over the place and the Sky Striker bandwagon still kinda hot until now, so here we go. ALSO, I love how Naturias negate anything your opponent does without needing to be activated, their negations just happen, it's so funny.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The Naturias</strong> - <span>These are the monsters that you need the most since, you know... it's a Naturia deck.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Naturia Hydrangea"">Naturia Hydrangea</a></strong> - <span>Searchable 1 of, free body on board for Synchro/Link climbing.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Naturia Horneedle"">Naturia Horneedle</a></strong> - <span>A Special Summon negation at a cost of Tributing another face-up Naturia monster.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Naturia Camellia"">Naturia Camellia</a></strong> - <span>One of the new Naturia monsters, it sends a Naturia card from your Deck to your GY upon Normal or Special Summon (most likely Naturia Sacred Tree), it also substitutes the Tributing cost of your Naturia monsters with sending the top 2 cards of your Deck to the GY instead, and allows you to Special Summon ANY ""Naturia"" monster from your GY if your opponent Normal or Special Summons a monster without targeting.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Marron&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Marron</strong></a> - <span>This is one of the cards that I don't see people play with the newer cards that much, but I like it because it's like a 4th and 5th copy of Camellia, except it's just for monsters. It also helps you recycle your one of Naturia monsters, except Naturia Ladybug (for the purposes of which I'll discuss later), but in order to maximize this card's use, you'd also need Naturia Spring Breeze.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Rosewhip&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Rosewhip</strong></a> - <span>This is a card that I don't really know how to feel about. It's a good floodgate, limiting your opponent into being able to use only 1 Spell/Trap per turn, but that's really it. Also, Naturia Beast and Naturia Barkion already can fulfill that role already, so I don't know. I might cut this in future testings. It's good for turn 3+, but it doesn't help me set up going first or second.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Cosmobeet&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Cosmobeet</strong></a> - <span>A searchable extender, I've decided to play only 1 of this for that reason. It's a low Level Tuner, I suppose, but that's really all it has going for it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Sunflower&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Sunflower</strong></a> - <span>Mandatory 1 of. Naturia Beast covers Spells, Naturia Barkion covers Traps, this and Naturia Camellia covers all monster effect activations of your opponent, which is not hard to set up with Naturia Sacred Tree.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Ladybug&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Ladybug</strong></a> - <span>This card is crazy. This is basically a Level Eater for Naturias whenever you Synchro Summon a Naturia monster. It's great for both Synchro and Link climbing.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Naturia Molcricket&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Naturia Molcricket</strong></a> - <span>The other new Naturia support. It's a half Rescue Rabbit going 1st, unless you get Gamma-d, and full going 2nd. It also Special Summons itself if your opponent summons a monster from the Extra Deck, or if you summon a Naturia monster from your Extra Deck (it doesn't have to be a Synchro Monster). Great for both setting up and follow up.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• The Vernalizers (EARTH Fairies)</strong> - <span>The complementary search engine for your Deck. They actually work great with Naturia, it sucks that they xenolock you into EARTHs though but hey, I guess you can't have everything. Their effects are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Qardan the Great Sage&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Qardan the Great Sage</strong></a> - <span>NOT a Vernalizer nor a Naturia card, originally part of Ishizu's EARTH Fairies (at least I think so). This is a searchable one of, and is most likely your preferred Normal Summon, since it allows you to set a Naturia Sacred Tree from your hand or GY which can be activated immediately, after sending it there to search a ""Naturia"" card from your Deck, except a copy of itself. It also lets you protect your Naturia Sacred Tree from destruction until the end of the next turn if it's sent to the GY.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Forests and Awakening&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Forests and Awakening</strong></a> - <span>The Vernalizer Foolish Burial for EARTHs.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Hills and Blooms&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Hills and Blooms</strong></a> - <span>The Vernalizer archetypal omni-searcher.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Flowers and Fields&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Flowers and Fields</strong></a> - <span>The Vernalizer Monster Reborn for EARTHs.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze</strong></a> - <span>The new Vernalizer card, that is a searcher for EARTH Fairies. This is how you get Qardan the Great Sage, after searching it with Hills and Blooms. I only play 2, originally I played 3 but I figured I can manage with less copies.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>• </strong><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;One for One&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>One for One</strong></a> - <span>Great one of for searching either Naturia Molcricket or Naturia Ladybug.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a></strong> - <span>For Naturia Sacred Tree.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>Great for decks that need help establishing GY set up.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> - <span>This originally wasn't here, but I figured to add it because it's a sacky one of extender.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a></strong> - <span>Search power, I'm actually a bit iffy about this one too but, better have it than not. Feel free to cut this if you don't like it btw.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> - <span>Defense.</span></span> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Spring Breeze"">Naturia Spring Breeze</a></strong> - <span>The third new Naturia support. A Quick-Play Spell that allows you to either Special Summon a Naturia monster from your hand or GY (which includes any of the Synchros or Exterio), or either Synchro Summon or Fusion Summon during your opponent's turn. My only Fusion target here is Naturia Exterio, because Naturia Gaiastrio only protects from cards and effects that targets EXACTLY 1 CARD, and requires you to have a card in hand to negate its activation, so yeah.</span></span>  <span><strong>Trap, without an ""s"", because I only play 1.</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a></strong> - <span>You wanna send this card to the GY as soon as possible, because it's the omni-searcher for the Deck. It also has an effect that lets you set up during your opponent's turn with negates and interruptions by Tributing either a Plant or Insect-type Level 4 or lower Naturia monster to summon another one with the other Type from the Deck. 2 is fine, in case you draw one.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a></strong> - <span>The secret boss of the Deck. This deck can actually play 2 of this, which is funny. It's a Fusion of both Naturia Beast and Naturia Barkion, that negates a the activation of an opponent's Spell/Trap by banishing 1 card from your GY then milling 1 off the top of your Deck, which is not only a better version of both but also makes sense thematically. Also, this is why I'm siding 3 Waking the Dragons at my Side Deck lol.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen"">Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen</a></strong> - <span>It's a walking Macro Cosmos that doesn't hurt you because you mostly pay cost by either milling your Deck or banishing from your GY. Also, it's a generic Level 9 that can come back for later purposes.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Leodrake"">Naturia Leodrake</a></strong> - <span>Oh man, I just wish you were better. The only relevant thing about it is that it's a second Level 9 (not even generic btw) and a Naturia monster by name. Naturias really need a new Synchro boss monster because Leodrake is just not enough by modern day standards.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a></strong> - <span>I'm not gonna lie, I never really see this coming up that much. I'm actually considering cutting this because I'm not playing <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Baronne De Fleur&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Baronne De Fleur</strong></a></span> anyway. I mean, it's a neat monster negate with a combat effect, I suppose.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>I mean, if you can make it, might as well, am I right? If Vernalizers didn't xenolock you into EARTHs, this would've been great with <span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;XX-Saber Gottoms&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>XX-Saber Gottoms</strong></a></span> and <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Cloudcastle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong><span>Cloudcastle</span></strong></a> for either <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong><span>Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir</span></strong></a> or the other Rank 9 that I chose to play instead.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Landoise"">Naturia Landoise</a></strong> - <span>Landoise... is not that bad. It's just not great. It's good enough to be a one of, since it can cover your opponent's monster effect activations at a cost of sending 1 Spell card from your hand to the GY.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Barkion"">Naturia Barkion</a></strong> - <span>It's the third boss monster, kinda, of the Naturia. It covers your opponent's Trap card activations at a cost of banishing 2 cards from your GY.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a></strong> - <span>Probably the most well-known Naturia monster (aside from Bamboo Shoot and Pineapple) for actually good reasons. It's a semi-generic Level 5 Synchro Monster, which isn't hard to make, and if my memory serves me right I think it got errata'd, but regardless, it covers your opponent's Spell card activations at a cost of milling the top 2 cards of your Deck.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a></strong> - <span>My Rank 9 of choice, since I can't play the hand loop version. It's an Invoked Mechaba but it detaches instead of discarding a corresponding material with the same card type in response to the activation of a card or effect to negate its activation. Plus, it's an EARTH monster.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></strong> - <span>After a pretty short deliberation, I've decided to go with the ol' reliable Avramax as my Link 4 of choice, with</span> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Borrelsword Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong></a> <span>as the close second, and</span> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Accesscode Talker&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Accesscode Talker</strong></a> <span>as the initial choice for the following reasons: Borrelsword doesn't have targeting protection but can provide massive damage, and Accesscode doesn't have any protection at all and will only get 2 pops at most with its effect. If I want to have a beat stick, I might as well get one that also protects itself.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a></strong> - <span>Probably unironically your best Link monster, if you really bricked that hard.</span> <strong>• <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></strong> - <span>I mean, I'm playing Avramax. Can't have one without the other. At this point I'm really struggling not to use both of them in any of my decks. They're just so good together, and I can't pass up the opportunity.</span> </span>  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong> </span>  <span>Side deck can be consisted of whatever you want. Either any <span><strong><a data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Kaiju</a></strong></span> + <span><strong><a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll</a></strong></span> or <strong><span><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru</a></span></strong> + <strong><span><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Lancea</a></span></strong> can work. <span><strong><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Droplet</a></strong></span> or <span><strong><a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">DRNM</a></strong></span>, it's up to you. <span><strong><a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a></strong></span> or <span><strong><a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a></strong></span>/<span><strong><a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">TT</a></strong></span>/<span><strong><a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a></strong></span>, your choice. I just played <span><strong><a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon</a></strong></span> because it's funny and I play 2 Exterio.</span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>I haven't really had any fun outside of non-Fusion decks in a while, and I just love decks that shit on Sky Strikers. It's just a good time. I still think that Naturias could use a new Synchro boss monster though. Since Naturias don't restrict you into anything I think I'll go test this deck more, probably to see if it could work with my Fusion decks since the only thing that xenolocks me into anything are the Vernalizers or if I could run it at 42+ cards instead and still be just as consistent or even more, possibly. Overall, I'm satisfied with this deck so far and I'm glad to see Naturia get love after all these years. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>  <span>Edit: I've edited the list since I didn't notice that <a data-name=""Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze"">Vernalizer Fairy of Seedlings and Haze</a> are not appearing. I also made some slight list adjustments relative to what ratios I'm playing currently, but it doesn't change the philosophy of the list.</span>"

Specifically made for Masterduel's Limit 1 Festival.,"This is the deck I have been using for Masterduel's Limit 1 Festival in high Diamond.  &nbsp;  Mill your deck to the GY and depending on which cards get sent, you have plays. This deck can comfortably play though interruption and deal with threats on board, especially with the right cards in hand. A central crux of this deck's strategy is turboing out Chaos Ruler to mill 5 to the GY + get a light/dark monster.  This deck is extremely expensive since it's 60 cards and mostly made out of SR/UR rarity, do don't make this deck in Masterduel unless you have deep pockets or you already own the cards. Regardless, this deck is super fun to pilot and extremely competent on ladder!"

Youtube link inside","<span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto""> I've consistently reached Platinum/Diamond 1 with this deck for several seasons already, so I thought I would share it!</span>  If you want a detailed explanation how to use this deck, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/generaider-windwitch-july-2021/"">click here.</a>  This deck features incredibly potent anti-meta cards like Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos, Imperial Order and True King of Calamities. Generaider Windwitch plays comfortably under these floodgates, while the opponent keels over and dies. If you have access to any of these cards, they generally insta-win you the game since they shut off almost every route of play.  While preferring to go first, this deck can still comfortably go second if forced to, since it features 12 hand traps. It can also play past interruption, since it has multiple methods to start off its gameplay.  I found it funny that almost nobody knows what the heck Generaiders and Windwitches do, and they end up underestimating the deck until it's too late. Before long, your opponent may find themself facing down Harr's omni-negate, Crystal Wing's monster negate, Dimension Shifter's banish, and lethal backrow like Judgment and Imperial Order!  Another bonus about this deck is that it functions nicely under Maxx ""C,"" the undisputed king of Master Duel. This deck doesn't summon much, so the opponent doesn't have much incentive to use Maxx ""C."" This deck can even function under Summon Limit or Winda!  The only major problem about this deck is that it bricks HARD, since there are 6 ""hard"" bricks in the deck (5 Generaider bosses + Ice Bell) and 1 ""soft"" brick (Glass Bell). This weakness is avoided with Pot of Prosperity and Maxx ""C"" functioning as cards that will get you starters for the deck.

Built around Vampire Kingdom unlike of the usual Zombie World build.,"<span class=""style-scope yt-formatted-string"" dir=""auto"">I like playing pure vampire because every vampire playaer seems to be on some sort of Zombie World package. So this is dedicated for all you purists out there. The deck is like fun casual deck but can surprise even meta decks. Especially when going first because it can search an omni negate counter trap which is always strong. I think the vampire deck plays a lot like salamangreat. Putting up couple of strong negates and can recover using graveyard. No overly complicated and long combos. The weak point of the deck is Vampire Ghost Ogre. Ash blossom on it can just stop your entire turn. Though you can add extenders like Vampire's Desire to try and keep going.</span>  https://youtu.be/-4zAkK_IQkE"

SO not playing this card is indeed bruh  Marincess Sleepy Maiden: you can sp this card from your hand by targeting the Marincess card you have and it can not be destroyed by card effect the importance of this card is allows you to play after getting hand traped also you can target your field spell and sp her.  one for one with Testudo Erat numen: basically the only card that saves you from kaiju  now some main points ( if I summon Erat I can't play my own combos ) don't worry you can use Marincess aqua Argonaut to return Erat to hand with one card your opponent controls to hand and guess what after you finished your combo ns Erat again and don't worry about getting destroyed by battle Marincess aqua Argonaut has effect says your opponent can't attack other monsters you have except this one so if you draw one for one it's gg and game over for your opponent.

Has a high chance of one-turn kill but probably second-turn kill.,This Deck focuses on summoning the xyz monster draglubion and activating its effect. You can easily summon it by using gizmek and the danger cards effects. Also focus on banishing as many cards from the extra and normal deck to then be able to utilize gren maju effect to its max.

For extra points to try to look cool with this deck you can go into rank 5 plays with N.As.H Knight into N.As.CH Knight to immediately go into Honor DARK. Mega Fortress Whale can also provide an OTK with this deck since it allows you to attack directly. I'm still learning this deck myself so sorry if this guide isn't really in depth but I do think this deck is really fun and awesome to play."

So it's time we expiriments for efficient alternatives ,"Video link in the description below  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/QsIAPSEuwlU"">https://youtu.be/QsIAPSEuwlU</a> )  It's still amusing how we're on the way into being already 6 months into the Albaz Strike's release date, and Branded-Despia still holds on as a top spot for the current metagame. Don't get me wrong though, I do love how fluent and flexible this fusion deck can be; but the main problem out of all this time playing it comes from how it runs out of gas too quickly. How does it run out of gas so quickly? The answer comes from the main deck and not from the Extra Deck, where you have pieces from Branded-Despia such as <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a>. So today I'm going to do a little experiment that adds a little extra fuel that doesn't cost an arm or a leg, but actually has something to utilize in its own way.  &nbsp;  Hence why I will be using an archetype known as *The Agents,* an archetype that usually utilizes in the cards <a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a> and <a data-name=""Master Hyperion"">Master Hyperion</a>. Why did I choose them over something like the *Thunder Dragons* or even a singular card like <a data-name=""Fairy Tail-Snow"">Fairy Tail-Snow</a>? To be reassuring, *The Agents* are an archetype that are both light/dark attribute; have searchers/millers that can be useful in extensional fusions for <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a> and even <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a> (such as <a data-name=""The Agent of Life - Neptune"">The Agent of Life - Neptune</a>); and can take full advantage of their own effects if <a data-name=""The Sanctuary in the Sky"">The Sanctuary in the Sky</a> is on the field (such as <a data-name=""The Agent of Mystery - Earth"">The Agent of Mystery - Earth </a>and its effect that searches <a data-name=""Master Hyperion"">Master Hyperion</a> if the field spell is on the field). Arguably, it does seem unorthodox considering that most of the time you want most of your fusion resources (that aren't <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia </a>or <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a>) in your GY; however it isn't always the case you need to build up your boards immediately on hand at the fastest rate possible (which if the disruption occurs could result in a hard time replacing the pieces you already used too quickly). Finally there is the new link monster (known as <a data-name=""Proctector of the Agents - Moon"">Proctector of the Agents - Moon</a>) which basically tributes any agent monster on the field (such as Earth, Uranus, and itself) to pop a card on the field, and on summon can add earth from your deck or GY to the hand.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

A lot of the cards in this deck are hit in other formats, but the engine is basically untouched in Master Duel - the third Rocksies is a Rock Deck hit, not a Pranks engine hit at all.  I decided to try and splice in DPE, and couldn't quite cut it to 40. Still experimenting with the list, this is one I didn't play in the regular format so even though I know what is strong about it I'm not adept at building Pranks lists yet. I think DPE is either worth it or obligatory, but I'm eschewing not to run Scythe, because I think there's more counterplay to it than people realize floating around, and I want cards that will gain me points against skilled opponents where I need them, rather than aiming for easier wins against unskilled opponents. Could be wrong - the right matches and Scythe is truly broken. But it also depends on making DPE all of the time, whereas here it is just a nice option when you see Fusion Destiny or overextend or get stopped."

There are 3 spells that have you discard a trap to fusion summon a monster that is basically a mirror force on  steroids that never goes away.  Kinda like that rash you got last weekend from that camping trip that you don't know where it came from. There are also some spell negation and counter traps."

I genuinely love the deck based on what they are and their lore  But either way, Swordsouls main goal is to bring out their main Synchro boss monsters, Chengying, Qixing Longyuan, and Baronne (the rest is for just in case and negaters) This is my own personal take on Swordsouls and honestly I love it. Before I forget, I only have the Psy monsters in the side deck and Framelord in the Extra deck is so I can find a good way in between duels to get Framelord out with its negates in between duels  Tenyi are known for their great support for many monsters and their strong monsters with Synchros as well as the Yang Zings  And remember, This is your friendly Duelist going through Battle City, Ultra/Echo, and until then Duelists...

Both Cursed Dragon and <a data-name=""Galloping Gaia"">Galloping Gaia</a> have <strong>effects that make sure your fusion's are able to go into battle</strong>, while these effects are very nice they only work while you have your fusions on the field so you have little to no protection while trying to get to said fusions; thankfully we play <strong>12 copies of Magical Knight</strong> (3 copies of itself, 3 Galloping Gaia, 3 <a data-name=""Artillery Catapult Turtle"">Artillery Catapult Turtle</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Gateway to Chaos"">Gateway to Chaos</a>) while also playing <strong>6 copies of Cursed Dragon</strong> (3 copies of itself, 3 Catapult Turtle) so it's not rare to have a hand where you don't die to the opponent's first interruption. Lastly, I'd like to point to out the synergy between Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons and your other interruptions like Super Poly and <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon,</a> a Knight of Dragons that already used it's effect can be used with Super Poly to go into <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> or be flipped face down with Book of Moon and then be flipped face up so it gets it's original 2600 ATK back in case it went down to 0, allowing it to use it's effect once again.</span>  "

But seriously it is a contender for the wackiest deck out there. You take advantage of world chalice cards and Venus to make some insane link plays which includes ending on a board with 6 negates and a true king of calamity. Atleast thats the dream typcially you can get a 4 stack apo with DPE or true king out fairly easily with the deck which in alot of games is enough to end the game. The deck is also very fun to play as each game feels like a new journey/path needed to get the win. So if you enjoy puzzles give the deck a try.

So one could say that they've leapt the Dragon Gate. What does that mean? Lemme explain.  &nbsp;  In Chinese mythology, there is a gate called Dragon Gate on top of a waterfall in the Yellow River. Many carp try to swim upstream and leap over the waterfall, but few are strong or brave enough to do this. If a carp manages to jump over the waterfall and reach the Dragon Gate, they will be transformed into a powerful dragon. This is so famous in China that ""trying to leap Dragon Gate"" means suddenly improving your social status.  &nbsp;  In light of that and how Marincess went from good to great, this deck is named ""Marincess Dragon Carp.""  &nbsp;  As for this deck, it does better going first, but thanks to the 12 hand traps this deck plays, it can be decent if it has to go second. Your strategy is to set up as many disruptions as you can, and this deck can end on a board consisting of Aqua Argonaut summoned with Marincess Crystal Heart, Toadally Awesome, Battle Ocean, and a Marincess Wave or two."

Do not play this.,"Do you win coin tosses? Do you like playing decks so low IQ they actually deal psychic damage to skilled opponents? Is you ideal opening hand one with 0 Monsters? Can't ever brick if none of your cards are bad. This deck is tough - you have to normal summon a monster and set 5 backrow. The joke is, that actually is skill intensive as a strategy. Still, this joke of a pile is sweet, better than trying to make Serziel work in these sorts of shells. I think Luna stun builds do better if you lose the coin toss, but I think this list is nastier going first. On the other hand, why play this instead of Aleister or Live Twins? Crickets. It is just to annoy people. But it is fully capable of doing that!  Luna is better, so the shell is Luna now. Sorry thing that searches Droplet."

So I made this! I tried to include all the summoning types, but this is very much made to be ""decent"" at best. This is a consistent deck (Odd-Eyes has so many searchers it's not funny) that wasn't made with any specific end board in mind, so it's game plan is a more open ended one; see what you open and where it takes you. I included all 4 Dimension Dragons and made sure the deck can summon them, because for me the win condition is summoning Z-ARC using all 4.  &nbsp;  Again, dont expect it to do well against high power decks, and I definitely made some sub-optimal choices in the name of theme, but it's fun, decently strong and pretty much endlessly customizable. The Extra Deck can be almost anything you want here, this deck literally can do it all!"

Eats the midrange decks I play, at least.","Make Sera, Set 5, Pass. Maybe Rafflesia on occasion. Some Rank 4 options are nice. Zeus is a good card. Mostly just a pile of traps. Solemns and IO for Lightning Storm and Harpie's. Trap Trick pile with lots of extra goodies. Ice Dragon's Prison is a good card. Yeah, this pile is nice. If you're playing BO1 on the ladder and you can win coin tosses this deck is pretty cracked, and I think with Multifaker at 1 this might be the better dumb trap deck if NS a monster set 5 pass is you're preferred playstyle. Eldlich does better on the ladder, but I swear this is just by the power of floodgates - this deck probably takes slightly more brainpower, and it's engine is less powerful but less bricky as well.  Continued testing and learning the deck, adjusted the list. Here's the card by card.  For Generic interruptions, I decided to keep things pretty standard, because I don't want to be caught out without hand traps even in a BO1 going second scenario (especially in a BO1 going second scenario). This may be a control deck, but I want to play the game. Adjustments have been made - Gravedigger's, Ice Dragon's, and D. Shifter are performing some of the jobs of Called By the Grave, and we're on 0 Spells to make IO ridiculously broken, but also because we just need critical mass of Trap cards and have no room for Pot cards. D. Shifter and Maxx ""C"" conflict slightly, but there's some cool tech plays you can make with both in the deck. You can keep the GY empty for the Shifter and chain Maxx ""C"" to it in response to their first summon, also very plausible when going second. You play through Shifter admirably, and oddly it enables some Shade Brigandine plays as well, and having 3 Maxx ""C"", a mass of hand traps, and 3 Shifter gives you plenty of tools to steal games, and so despite minor conflict I think this list of hand traps is tight. Imperm and Ice Dragon's also can be found off of Trap Trick, a package I've run just for that which does much more here. Our last, sort of generic interrupt cards are 3 Solemn and the 1 IO. IO is a gamestealer, and is also just generically really good, and our deck loses very little to play it. It also gives us 4 cards against 3 Lightning Storm 1 Harpie's, a not uncommon ratio of sweepers that is perhaps even reasonable with Eldlich variants stealing games all over the place (sometimes a bad deck is good).  For Traptrick monsters, I've decided to run 9 - 3 Myrmeleo, I thought this would be the best one, until I learned the plays and realized in the deck Mantis is usually better, 3 Mantis, bester starter, 2 Vesiculo, this card has really impressed me, it is worth is as our 1 monster most of the time and is a way better extender than that effect reads on impression, and 1 Dionaea, I don't think you need this card, but it is a great follow-up and searchable and summonable with the engine - I think 1 for Sera makes sense, and you'll occasionally grab this off of Mantis. I'm fine seeing 2-3 names in this engine, because you'll usually see them with the Hole that unstucks you. I also do want to actually put monsters on the board in most of my games, and hate seeing Shade Brigandine alone. I'll accept some number of bricky hands existed to insulate me from different kinds of bricky hands - I'd rather brick out with 2 monsters and 2-3 interruptions than with 5 Trap cards, but your milage may vary.  We're obviously on 3 Shade Brigandine for our main extenders - this card turns the engine on by breaking the rules of Trap cards while making Rafflesia, this card is terrible alone and insane alongside any Traptrix monster. Do no trim this card - multiples suck, but you need to open the first copy as often as possible to actually feel like you're doing anything but setting trap cards.  There are also 8 ""Traptrick"" traps, 8 holes in pairs, and 2 Trap Trick. The pairs are mostly for Trap Trick, which is pretty nutty even if you only have a couple targets, and seems cracked open here. Paul (Gravedigger's) is the best Trap Hole, but Nightmare helps us hit 5 Monster negates in the deck, and Floodgates gum up the board while disabling most summoning mechanics. These are highly accessible within the engine, you should have  access to 2-3 of these names every game. I like these numbers for the grind, this deck is slow.  In testing I found not having Accesscode was a mistake - Utopia Double takes 2 bricks in the extra deck and 1 in the main to never come up, whereas Accesscode. The extra deck is just good generic rank 4s and Zeus, with maxxed out numbers of the good Traptrix cards and single copies of the meh ones.  The maindeck remains the same, but I've realized something kinda big, that a lot of people don't seem to be one in any format... With Zoodiac Chakanine, any Rank 4 Xyz can go into Boarbow to attack directly 9 (for 0) and make a 4 material Zeus.

I think having a 4 material Zeus out of a Rank 4 material that attacks directly is kind of huge, I can't believe I haven't thought of this before."

NEVER BRICK AGAIN ,"Trying new things in hero, this current list is the most consistent list i have seen. Impossible to brick, except drawing the 1 of increase, and most of the time the hands are playable.  9 tech spots for the meta, i like this number bc it gives you a good chance to open 1 and sometimes 2, in hero you want 4 engine cards cause that is how you play through hand traps and push for game going second.  Feel free to play super poly instead of imperm or triple tactics, i dont like super poly bc i dont like giving up the extra deck slots , but you can cut the link 3 , 1 dark law, esquirdio, and bakooska and get alot of targets.  I dont play the evil heros just bc i feel hero can otk fine without it and it doesnt help the decks weeknesses with the cost of two main deck bricks.  2 poly in main deck is great, mainly for when you get impermed on vyon or to just extend. Also solid soilder and poly in hand with any normal summon hero is a good combo and can play around imperm. You can normal solid then if they imperm you can poly with the normal summon hero in hand then chain block sunriser into solid revive. Nice way to bait out imperms if you can.  Bakooska is for when you have no lines in ur hand except two lvl 4s , can still be pretty strong, and in certian match ups you wanna just make bakooska."

The goal is to spam metalfoes monsters with Rescue Rabbit, Emergency Teleport, Pendulum Scale and other lovely cards, and with them you are able to do Fusions, Xyx and Links.

It's pretty much classic. I tried many builds like PUNK/Dinomorphia to abuse of Psychic End Punisher but was sometimes too bricky. I think pure Dinomorphia is the best after all. They don't really need external support except for the generic traps of course.  I know some of Dinomorphia players won't agree with Skill Drain since we have Rexterm that does pretty much the same job but it's a very strong floodgate that allows your Kentregina to be full power and it's a backup plan to Rexterm. It also prevents you from stupidly dying to a direct attack (Hayate, the ritual Libromancer...) when you're low in life points.  Your opponent destroys your Skill Drain? It's not a concern: just make Rexterm and Skill Drain is basically back. I owe so many victories to Skill Drain.  The other floodgates are just about preferences and the decks that are played at your locals. You can play Gozen Match or Rivalry of the Warlords if you want to.  The side deck will help you to deal with going second: Shifter can end your opponent's turn, Lava Golem can get rid of problematic cards, Evenly Matched, well, you all know how strong this card is...  I made the choice to not run hand traps for the moment but maybe I will include Ash in the near future. But really, you don't need them in a deck that relies heavily on traps. If I'm reflecting on Ash it's only because I want the possibility to make Psychic End Punisher.  I'm also reflecting on some other cards: fossil dig + Misc, Lost World..."

I figured that the P.U.N.K engine has a lot of the solutions to the problems of the deck. They don't clog your hand, they're level 3, they pump out synchro monsters. This is pretty much everything infernity wants. I would appreciate some ideas from better yugioh players lol. Essentially you're looping Infernity archfiend which the many ways to Monster Reborn it to create 4 mat Apollousa, and a really big Borreload Savage Dragon with a Saryuja equipped to it with a Infernity Barrier set.

Dogmatic Evil * Twins,"So, Live/Evil * Twin is in a very strange spot in this meta. Without Trouble Sunny, the deck has some trouble closing out games, and can't quite achieve its full potential in terms of card advantage. Still, we're 1 link away from the deck getting a lot better. I decided after playing a pure list for a while to branch into a Dogmatika engine splash. I've always been high on Ecclesia, and while usually that is for Punishment, Fleurdelis seems pretty insane in this build.  The idea is pretty simple - cut Home for Ecclesia, which is better as an extender and will serve as a fine alternate starters, make some space in the extra deck for some bricks, and run it back. This list is pretty much my pure Evil Twin list with that minor adjustment, and so far it is performing much better for me. Let's get into the card by card.  So, Live Twins, we're on 7, 3 Lil-la, 2 Ki-Sikil, 1 Frost, 1 Treat. Frost and Treat together put us up to what feels like an effective 7 extenders, since each only extends out of 1 Twin play, and they're usually not that useful, but Frost's draw power is truly ridiculous, and Treat's battle effect will save your Twin's butts reasonably often. We trim Ki-Sikil because we want more of our starts that lead into Frost, to maximize the draw power of the engine. You could cut Treat, and you could consider 2 (or maybe even 3) Frost, but I like these numbers. We're also on 3 Password and 3 Sunny's Snitch. Password in this version is basically just more Snitches, though it will occasionally search out the Evil Twins maindeck monster. Snitch is insane - the little bit of drain disables a lot of OTKS, and also enables a lot of OTKs as well, that little chip goes a long way even without time in the deck. Since you can search Treat and Frost these are still sort of extenders, even if that aspect is diminished by the cutting of Home. We also run a lone copy of Twins. The Evenly style effect is very good on occasion, but mostly it's just a 4.4k beater, and it is good at opening up KOs by doing that. It'll be better once Sunny is here, both when you see it to OTK, and to have a backup way to send (which is searching it) for the cost of Trouble's board breaking prowess. For now the card is just fine. One card I've cut quite deliberately is the 1 good trap, Evil Twin Present. The card is fine, but I'm not sold on it being very good to see or search in most instances. If it was better at dealing with backrow it would make the cut, but it deliberately doesn't shoot down a flipped floodgate, and that just feels way too slow most of the time, and the trade effect is IMO way worse than Enemy Controller, which I'd normally never run, but feels pretty sweet in this list.  Dogma package is pretty standard IMO, you don't see this a lot these days, but since DPE and other similar packages conflict with Evil Twins I think it really is the best card for this role here. Nadir Servant is freaking wild, and always has been, but we're also still hoping to see Ecclesia the normal way as well (though if we had 2 servant, I'd cut to 2 Ecclesia). The extra deck space for this package is kind of tight, I still want Almiraj for I:P and Bagooska plays as well as to extend into Ecclesia when a Twin gets Ashed, Impermed, etc. Then there are 2 cards you run with the package - Fleurdelis, which is a non-targeting Imperm so long as you have Ecclesia on board, but also just a free SS2 Special, and with it's ATK buff ability it enables OTK lines quite easily (Twins + Ecclesia = Fleurdelis is over 9000!). I usually find Fleurdelis a little bricky, but this deck needs the free beater and the negate enough that typically the Knighted feels pretty good even without Ecclesia, and truly exemplary with her.  I'm also on 3 Parallel Exceed. This are much worse without the Accesscode OTK line, which came up a fair bit, but are primarly to make Bagooska anyways. I cut Zeus for a Wind Peg when I found I needed a 3rd target to send with the Dogma package - Zeus and Goddess are both potentially good here, but I found Goddess almost never came up and often couldn't be summoned when you needed it, whereas Zeus very rarely came up, and never felt essential, and usually wasn't in great form for a Zeus anyhow. The interruptions are pretty standard for Evil Twin as well - the usual Ash/Maxx ""C"" cards are here with some backrow disruption, plus Imperm and Droplet. Droplet is way better here than you'd think - the ""battle trap"" style ability of it is super clutch here, and the tech play of sending your monsters from the field to the GY to protect them from Imperm/Veiler/Chixiao... etc... is super clutch. Enemy Controller is also in the mix, it's the 4th copy of Droplet for that cray tech play, but wildly enough ditching your own monster to steal one feels amazing, especially when it enables a Twin effect, and weirdly the ""switch to defense mode"" option comes up a lot if you remember the card does that. I think it's hilariously on theme that the ""gamer gurl"" deck with a card called ""GG EZ"" is the one TCG/OCG deck that actually wants the Gamepad in its list, but I've also had such luck with this card that I don't want to cut it. It never quite feels good enough as a 2 of, but always feels good as a 1 of.  3 of each Evil Twin is needed in the Extra Deck to actually have plays - you'll go through 2 of 1 name on your first turn. Once Trouble Sunny is here, you can cut down to 2/2/2. Bagooska is also basically essential if you run the Exceed package, and is arguably the main reason to run this package. The Drunkard Tapir has slowly gone from a niche tech option to a staple in most extra decks as more and more white people have realized how busted he is. (It seems like the Asians always knew, and I picked up the tech off of a black guy, but I swear us white people used to never play this card). Almiraj is... still nutty, by the simple virtue of being a link 1, and between Exceed and Ecclesia I think you still need to run this card. I:P is also debatable, especially without Goddess or Knightmare Phoenix, but there are good I:P setups, and making a protected Unchained Abomination remains a really good use of your resources. I think Abom and Unicorn are mandatory, I make Unicorn, mull a card while spinning a card, and then make A-Bomb on followups pretty often. Without Trouble in the deck, A-Bomb is your main Link 4, and it enables nutty engine stuff with the link 2s, and I think the tech actually gets better with Trouble (I:P + Trouble = A-Bomb into Twins having set up Trouble and gotten both Twins to chain each other). Accesscode is also probably essential - it just does close out games, the card is very very good. I think there's some room to wiggle with this extra deck, mainly you could cut Wind Peg for mostly anything, Almiraj rarely comes up, and Accesscode is very good but not always needed, but I like this Extra Deck a lot overall.  I've made the adjustment off of Wind Pegasus for Psy-Framelord Omega. Omega helps the Dogmatika engine grind and is also grave hate - initially it was just to have a target that let me search Fleurdelis, but in practice the card is insane and has already won me games I should have, and would have, lost without it. In like my first couple games.  I slightly adjusted the Dogmatika line-up, cutting 1 Ecclesia for a lone Effect Veiler. There's some internal debate about whether Veiler or Chalice is better - the advantages to each have come up when I've tested with both. But I decided to lean towards Effect Veiler, if only to round out my interruptions vs FTKs and screwed up floodgate monsters like Protos. This minor adjustment improved my win-rate almost immediately (though admittedly I'm also just getting better at playing the deck.) You really don't need the 4th Ecclesia in most matchups, and it actually results in you seeing too many Dogma cards too often when you run it, whereas having 18 ""1-for-1"" interruptions is super crucial to the deck's gameplan of drawing cards while trading well. Trouble Sunny should help this deck more than Adventure hurts it, so I'm looking forward to the next selection pack."

Snow and Forecast are one card starters, you can set up a pretty decent board by drawing into either of them.  A good turn 1 board usually consists of one or two the weather monsters and snowy, thundery and rainbowed canvas. You can achieve that pretty easily by using any level 3 The Weather and Snowy Canvas or just with the one card starters I listed above.  The main strategy is having a few (3 or 4 usually works pretty well) the weather spell or trap cards and Rainbow or Moonbow to abuse their effects and spam negates and return everything to the opponent's hand. Also Rainbow can send herself to GY to negate a summon so you can use it to stop floodgates."

To be honest, not much will change for me. 0 cards are different in the main deck than what I am running right now in the meta - I think the addition of Adventurers and Floowandereeze will have a big impact, but it doesn't really change what Evil Twin wants to run all that much - meanwhile Trouble Sunny slots in nice and easy, barely changing the extra deck - you cut some Evil Twins for different Evil Twins now that you don't need as many.  Despite not gaining very many cards, I think the deck gets a whole lot better rather than worse with this pack. Adventurers are strong, but the power boost this engine gets from Trouble cannot be overstated. The deck already excels at gaining card advantage and interacting, but Trouble seriously pushes that to new heights while opening up OTK lines left, right, and center. It also doesn't hurt that much to lose 1 for 1 interrupts to Gryphon Rider in this deck - that's sort of how the engine gains advantage over time, by 1-for-1ing people while drawing cards. It's an unusual strat in 2022, but many games the deck can seriously snowball even without Maxx ""C"". In fact, this is one of those decks where Maxx ""C"" not resolving actually feels really good (they're just playing into your plan when they 1-for-1 you!)  This list runs 2 ""extender"" packages - Parallel Exceed helps make Bagooska, which is seriously OP in this Link based shell, and is even summonable after using a Twin effect (and somehow Exceed into Bagooska is canon for Live Twins?) Exceed also helps to make I:P - I:P + Trouble is one of the deck's power boards, setting up 2 draws into Abomination + Twins. Also, in a pinch you can Almiraj + Exceed into either Bagooska or I:P into Unicorn. This package is good, but if you're in a BO3 event you'll cut these game 2 relatively often. This is the kind of deck where having 20 interactive cards truly pays off.  The other extender package is the Dogmatika cards. Thanks to Evil Twins restrictions, Ecclesia ends up being far more reliable than DPE or really any other alternative here. Oddly, Fleurdelis, which I tend to find a bit bricky, is also very very clutch for this engine, and feels good even without Ecclesia here, just for the absence of good beaters. This package actually opens up more OTKs than it kills (by removing Update Jammer - Transcode) because of Fleurdelis being busted. Punishment is kind of weak here - great if it stops their turn, but worthless if your board gets broken and you're locked out of the extra deck, so I'd search Fleurdelis most of the time if you have to choose, and I'd consider carefully before activating Punishment in this deck. I think you still need to run this card in the engine, and it does win games, but it should be considered at high-risk of untimely activation.  I've made one minor change to the deck - Wind Peg is out, Omega is in. I needed a card to send to search Fleurdelis for value, but honestly, being able to recycle your Dogmatika bricks is also insanely clutch. Omega is so good you don't even need to summon him for him to be the best there is at what he does! It came up pretty fast after making the switch, and while Wind Pegasus is good, Omega has already made himself indispensable.  Still perpetually tuning. I cut a single Ecclesia for a lone copy of Chalice, freeing up space in the extra deck to run Lightning Storm as additional board breaker cards going second. The third Ecclesia was just slightly bricky, but more importantly, isn't that important for achieving preferred Dogmatika ratios. I realized when building the side plan that in a lot of matchups I don't even want the third Ecclesia, and doing some math it hurts slightly more than it helps.  I have a basic Side Deck plan here for BO3 events. May not actually enter any, but I figured I'd share. I considered the top 6 decks I thought I would see in the racist metagame, and came up with these 6 (in no particular order)  &nbsp;  Eldlich Control/Zombie World Eldlich  Tri-Bri (Zoo, and Bird)  Swordsoul variants  Racist Prank-Kids  Virtual World (P.U.N.K. and Racist)  Floowanderdeze nuts  &nbsp;  I based my side deck around siding for these matchups, as well as running as many generic cards that I thought I could bring in when any of my cards were bad, after compiling a list of staples I thought would be good.  <em><strong>Basic siding guide for Evil Twins Dogmatika, in the Adventurer (racist) metagame.</strong></em>  <strong>Eldlich/Zombie Eldlich</strong>  Out - 3x Imperm 3x Droplet  In - 1x Cosmic Cyclone 1x Twin Twisters 1x Red Reboot 1x Harpie's Feather Duster 2x Skull Meister  This basically stands in for any backrow matchup, though Skull Meister is only for GY based Trap decks, really mainly Eldlich. The goal is to go down on bad cards that only hit Monsters, our Chalice effects, and up on Backrow hate. Because of my style I'm on cards that are good going first and second rather than Lightning Storm or Evenly, but you could sub those in and be very happy when you go second. Cut Imperm before Droplet, since sending a monster from the field to the GY is a bonus in this deck. You could consider D.D. Crow, but I've always found Meister to be higher impact in general, even though for the specific matchups I'm preparing for Crow might actually be better, so it is something to consider.  <strong>Tri-Bri (Bird Up and Zoo)</strong>  Out - 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia 1x Imperm 1x Ash 1x Maxx ""C""  In - 2x Skull Meister 1x Red Reboot 2x Chalice  These 2 decks are basically the same, though Bird Up can make Barrier Statues and end on bigger boards, whereas Zoo Tri is just more consistent and more powerful going second. Either way, our goal is to neuter their negate(s) on our turn. Reboot only comes in if they're on Revolt (all Zoo are, some Bird Up aren't), but Meister should come in whether they are DPE or not. I don't want to cut Maxx ""C"" but Zoo plays through it very well, and vs Bird Up Chalice might just be better anyways, especially since we're reducing the risk of seeing multiples.  <strong>Swordsoul (Racist, Protos, P.U.N.K.)</strong>  There are so many ways to play this deck. Protos. DPE. P.U.N.K. Rose Dragon. Adventurer. That doesn't even count Blind Second Swordsoul Tenyi, or account for the Tenyi ratios and support varying dramatically from shell to shell, or pay any mind to Trap variants, so while this is a good guide overall, this is the matchup where you should tailor your interrupts against the version you are facing.  Pure Protos Out - 1x Ash Blossom 1x Ecclesia 1x Droplet  In - 3x Effect Veiler  The deck is well tuned to Swordsoul in general, thankfully, but a single Protos is the most devastating thing they can do turn 1, and while Ash is needed vs Maxx ""C"", it doesn't do a lot in the matchup as a distruption. Droplet is good vs Swordsoul in general, but bad against Protos, and holding the Imperm can be wrong in the matchup. As a result, we're trimming a Droplet, Ecclesia, and an Ash, and slamming 3 Effect Veiler. We're hoping to stop them on their turn from locking us out of the game on ours. Otherwise, bizz as uzhe.  Racist  Out - 3x Paralell Exceed 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia  In - 3x Ghost Ogre 2x Chalice  Vs the Adventurer versions of the deck, stopping the Adventure becomes a priority, whereas extending is great and all, but simply not as valuable. 2 Chalice come in vs most versions, but if they're on Protos side into the Effect Veiler instead.  P.U.N.K/DPE  No changes (run-er back)  OR  Adjust for backrow  This version of the deck we're tuned for, but if they're leaning into backrow, you may have to bring in sweepers, since Swordsoul is a surprisingly good trap deck.  Also consider making cuts for Meister if they are on DPE. This is the deck you'll most often have to ""wing-it"" against tho, seriously, Swordsoul is a spicy deck.  <strong>Adventurer Prank-Kids (DPE)</strong>  Out - 2x Cosmic Cyclone 3x Imperm  In - 1x Harpie's Feather Duster 1x Twin Twisters 3x Ghost Ogre  If DPE, also - Out - 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia  In - 2x Skull Meister  Prank-Kids with the Adventurer engine is very powerful, and while DPE can be hard to make space for, the combination of the 3 engines is extremely powerful in a swingy sort of way. However, Chalice style effects deal with Battle Butler and Gryphon Rider pretty well, and Ghost Ogre and Ash answer Adventure pretty well, so you're playing to see if they're on DPE and decided whether to bring in Meisters or not. You could bring in more sweepers, but mostly you just want to replace single target backrow hate for stuff that sweeps Adventure and Pranks.  <strong>VW (P.U.N.K./Adventurer)</strong>  Out - 1x Enemy Controller 1x Ecclesia 1x Lil-la Treat  In - 2x Chalice 1x Harpie's  If Racist Out - 3x Parallel Exceed In - 3x Ghost Ogre  This deck is tough to prepare for, because you want all of your cards and then some. Going up on backrow hate very slightly will keep the trap from being too troublesome, but there isn't enough room to overprepare for VW Gates. Instead, you have to focus on stopping VFD from taking over, and while Ash will help with that somewhat, truth be told Chalice style effects are your best friend here. If they're on Adventurers instead of P.U.N.K. cards cutting your Exceed won't kill most of your starts, but having some Ghost Ogre will absolutely swing the matchup. In this matchup, extending isn't anywhere near as important as being able to simply play.  <strong>Floowandereeze</strong>  Out 3x Parallel Exceed  In - 1x Red Reboot 2x Chalice  I guess this is deck #6 to beat? This might actually be the dumb control deck to beat in the new meta instead of Eldlich, but I think we're tuned okay to beat it. Bringing in both Chalice should give us tools to beat the deck's weird Floodgates, to the point that I think Chalice is better than Imperm here. Red Reboot stops the trap. You could consider Ghost Ogre if it looks like they're on 3 of the Field Spell, and I think most will be, but it isn't actually necessary, so feel the meta out.  That actually leaves 1 slot to play with. I opted for Dinowrestler Pankratops, just a good generic going second card. When you know you're going second, it can come in over Backrow hate and generally be more useful, but it is just an all-purpose card that should come in whenever you are not going first."

Activate Zombie World as early as possible so you can get a free Dragonecro from milling a Tearalaments Monster. Typically you are looking to make Baronne early with the Wandering Gryphon Rider and Uni-Zombie or Ze Amin and then go into Halqifibrax to pull out Glow-Up Bloom. Link the Glow-Up Bloom into Linkuriboh in order to pull out Changshi and then send a card based on what you need at the moment. The path to a final board will be very dependent on what you mill, but it can pretty consistently get Baronne, Zombie Dragon Lord, Yuki-Onna (from link laddering with Vampire Fascinator), and Halqifibrax on the field with Balerdroch in the graveyard for next turn. If the Artifact Scythe was milled, you can revive it during the opponents draw phase using Zombie Dragon Lord and then Halqifibrax into Formula Synchron to make Chengying during the main phase. If Artifact Scythe is still in the deck, you can Halqifibrax into Shooting Riser, send Artifact Scythe to make it level 2, then Synchro for Chengying with Balerdroch and revive Scythe with Zombie Dragon Lord. If all goes well, the final board on your opponents' turn should have at least Baronne, Chengying, Zombie Dragon Lord, Yuki-Onna, and Artifact Scythe with its lock in place. Make sure to get use out of Balerdroch's negate and banish before you synchro him away as well if possible."

You get TOTAL ANTIHALATION MIRROR FORCE!!!!!!!  It's all mirror force, plus a little extra. There are 3 spells that have you discard a trap to fusion summon a monster that is basically a mirror force on  steroids that never goes away.  Kinda like that rash you got last weekend from that camping trip that you don't know where it came from. There are also some spell negation and counter traps just to keep your enemy guessing to your strategies and shut down every move they make with cards like Skill drain. Lots of things to make any opponent loose their mind. Plus a kuribo that keeps your enemy from attacking just to throw a cherry on top."

The deck is a speed roid strategy, plus the windwitch engine. The engine allows you to go +2 in card advantage without using your normal, with the drawback of synchro lockin you. That's true only for the ice belle line, that gives you either a battle protected baronne or an effect destruction protected crystal wing. The deck can play around floodgates decently, thanks to cards like apoullousa, wind pegasus and kite drake. also even under skill drain you usually can summon 3k beaters easily."

I thought of making and playing this deck when I felt the biggest drawback of pure Sky Strikers going second was to brick with only spells and no monsters to get on the board, while with Eldlich/Balerdroch it was having monsters ready but not many spells to react with on your turn if you were to go second. Since both playstyles involve having generally few/recycleable monsters on board with most things happening in the GY, it seemed fun to combine the two, since I have not seen many people play this. Played this deck up to Diamond 2 in Master Duel (with some substitutions because of the different rulings and cards like Linkage! and H.A.M.P. not being released yet in TCG at the time of this edit), so it holds its ground with the main drawback of being inconsistent with the opening hand.

If this is the case my friend, well I have the deck for you. While indeed this does tend to get devoured by the jaws of death (known only as <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a>), Invoked - Branded - Blue-Eyes combines all the absolute simplicity of recreating the German Blitzkrieg strategy without years of planning or making literal investment (except when I had to do in a span of a week). All that is needed is a pilot that is familiar with Fusion based mechanics, and a optimal side deck that stops pesky hand traps from the oncoming siege in Gdańk itself (like <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> or <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>).</p> Now if you aren't familiar with these three archetypes already, I'll give you a TL;DR rundown to save time within this paragraph for the sake of trying to simplify; but be clear about these three to who aren't familiar with them already. <span>Aleister on normal summon searches the spell card</span> <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> <span>and goes into either</span> <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>, <a data-name=""Invoked Caliga"">Invoked Caliga</a>, <span>or</span> <a data-name=""Invoked Augoeides"">Invoked Augoeides</a>. <span>Branded package is based around the monster</span> <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>, <span>who has multiple fusion monsters that can</span> <span>help in various situations (whether it would be to recover banished pieces, extend fusion plays, or clear away a big ol' threat).</span> <span>Then we got the Blue-Eyes arsenal that (while no longer on terms and conditions with its Synchro monsters) can still cause collateral damage, and has new support to protect other monsters (and cause trouble for your opponent), such as </span><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon </a><span>and</span> <a data-name=""Dictator of D."">Dictator of D.</a>  Now the question I have had during testing, but only for the part where Blue-Eyes comes in: How does Seto Kaiba's iconic monster have synergy between both Invoked and Branded strategies? To simply put it, it's a LIGHT-Attribute, Dragon-Type Monster that can be anywhere at any time for any scenario. Hence why I have the fusion monster <a data-name=""Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon on"">Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon on </a>standby. How I do it though is this: I use <a data-name=""Branded fusion"">Branded fusion</a> to mill your <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> and maybe something like <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> (if on the field) or <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> (if in my deck); to then get <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a>, and proceed to collect all of my Dragon-Type monsters that are banished or in the GY (including Lubellion) to be recycled for second/third use. As a result, I can continue creating efficient boards without having to worry about resources or having to budget out what I have to use in one singular turn when it comes to getting that point on hand."

The general strategy, is to link summon Knightmares and when you activate their effects, discard a danger card. I added Orcust Knightmare to get some extra damage and it can be summoned back using World Legacy - World Wand. The Xyz monsters are what you make of them. Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack can link climb, Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon can do lots of damage. The one I like the most is Number 7: Lucky Straight. I feel it is the same energy as the Danger cards summon condition. I didn't add Ash Blossom Because I wanted to keep the deck somewhat ""budget"", but if you wanted to add them i would take out 1 Danger Thunderbird, 1 Twin Twister, and 1 Dark World Dealings.  &nbsp;  Overall, this is just meant to be a fun deck. if you no someone who's trying to get into the game, this would be a fun deck for them."

Now what if your deck was made entirely of your back row??? You get TOTAL ANTIHALATION MIRROR FORCE!!!,"They key to any good strategy is your back row. Now what if your deck was made entirely of your back row??? You get TOTAL ANTIHALATION MIRROR FORCE!!!!!!!  It's all mirror force, plus a little extra. There are 3 spells that have you discard a trap to fusion summon a monster that is basically a mirror force on  steroids that never goes away.  Kinda like that rash you got last weekend from that camping trip that you don't know where it came from. There are also some spell negation and counter traps just to keep your enemy guessing to your strategies and shut down every move they make with cards like Skill drain. Lots of things to make any opponent loose their mind. Plus a kuribo that keeps your enemy from attacking just to throw a cherry on top."

The issue with Isolde is that you actually need to make it before you can use it.  What I mean is that, the only cards that you would actually <em>want </em>to use for Isolde would be non-level 4 warriors, because making a rank 4, even if it isn't the otk, has more payoff than Isolde.  The reason for this is that if Isolde summons Blades, then you would need to have 3 heroics in hand to discard for Blades, otherwise you aren't getting any actual payoff from making the Isolde in the first place.  One could argue that you only need 2 discards since technically that would leave you with 3 lvl 4s and Isolde herself, but the only thing that gives you over the same play in a deck that doesn't run Isolde, would be a unicorn, which <em>also </em>needs a discard, albeit a generic discard, leaving you in essentially the same vice.  Wether you have 2 heroics or 3 in hand with the Isolde play, the issue is that more often than not, heroics are free lvl 4 extenders, and you wouldn't need to use material on the Isolde anyways.  Assuming that you are in a situation where you have 2 or 3 dead heroics in hand, AND you need to get 2 Isolde material on field, that would leave you with 2 cards in hand to actually be hts or board breakers. In most match-ups, that isn't enough to win, unless it's specifically the one(s) you need, and running Isolde (which would need 4+ brick equip spells, mind you) wouldn't be able to rescue you.  &nbsp;  Heroic Challenger - Clasp Sword  Fun fact for all of the 2 (max) people reading this: one of the many, MANY, reasons that I've detached myself from the rest of the ""heroic community"" (one other player and his abusive friend) is over disputes of the usefulness of clasp sword, many of which ""ended"" with me getting muted after getting insulted and yelled at for about an hour because I managed to realize that Clasp has no actual place in a heroic deck.  But all of my deep hatred of them aside, I can certainly understand why a new player with no heroics experience would believe that Clasp is useful, although I must admit I don't understand the staunch defense of it.  The reason that I despise Clasp so much, is that it just plain isn't worth making. The reason you would play clasp is so that you could add another lvl 4 heroic extender after summoning it w/ Blades (one of 2 ways to trigger Clasp, the other being Ambush Soldier), However all that leaves you with is (assuming you have nothing unrelated) is Blades, Clasp, and a lvl 4, but if you didn't run/summon Clasp, then you would be left with Blades and whatever lvl 4 you would summon off of blades.  At first glance, this seems to prove that Clasp truly does have a use. After all, it gives you another body, and since this is a rank 4 spam deck, Clasp would <em>also </em>be a lvl 4...  ...right?  It isn't. It's lvl 1.  Not to mention the fact that using Blades's effect locks you into heroics for the rest of the turn, so you can't even use it for link material.  Now, if any Extra-pilled fellow such as I were to explain this one of the filthy Clasp-pilled lot, I can assure you they would respond with ""Clasp doesn't add a lvl 4, it adds Knuckle, then you summon Knuckle from hand with its own effect, so you can make Jarn and summon a lvl 4 from your gy.""  (Side note: Knuckle will usually be classified as another lvl 4 extender, but in this case you wouldn't use its 2nd effect and it would stay lvl 1)  However, as my brothers have already figured out, the difference between using Clasp that way and not using it at all, is that using it gives you a spent Jarn.  Filthy Claspians would argue that that is better than not running it, which while technically being true, is overlooking a few things.  First and foremost, Clasp is a HARD GARNET. This means that if you draw it, it is entirely <em>useless.</em> And before someone can get a chance to say it, no, being a discard for Blades is <strong>not </strong>a use.  Secondly, Jarn's protection won't matter that late, since most always anyone would just use anything that pops would just quickfire it on the summon of Blades, so you wouldn't be able to summon anything at all. And keep in mind that, even the people who would die on Clasp's hill would agree that Blades is the only reasonable way to trigger Clasp anyways.  Forbidden Droplet  You literally just can't afford to discard a bunch of stuff, I don't really know how to elaborate at all.  &nbsp;  Now that I've gone through all of the things that I get lambasted for not running, I'd like to take this time to explain some of my ""spicier,"" as some would say, deck-building choices.  Denko Sekka &amp; Bujinki Ahashima  Yes, I know that Sekka is a thunder monster and not a warrior, just hear me out here.  If you win game 1 against a backrow heavy deck, then a Sekka backed by your 15/17 hts is usually just a free win.  Some of you may be wondering why I've paired Ahashima with Sekka, and that's because Ahashima is what you use Sekka for turn 3.  Sekka herself may not be a warrior, but she's still a lvl 4 monster, so if you summon a lvl 4 warrior on turn 3 and make Ahashima with that and Sekka, you can still make Claive assuming you have another lvl 4 warrior in your hand.  And before you ask, yes, this IS Ahashima's only use, but the ED is really open in heroic decks.  Extra Sword  I'll admit, Extra isn't important.  At all.  The reason that I run it is because it's the 2nd best thing to summon off of Blades after Morning Star, and given the fact that Morning Star is a 3 of with 4 searchers, I would like to have some back-up. If you would like to, you can absolutely replace Extra with anything else (unless it's one of the things I said to not play, as my word is next to law).  Have fun"

I love Lavals, and I would like it to have some good support, but there's barely any without sacrificing spaces or augmenting the possibility of a brick. I have to admit that the last help that had in Lightning Overdrive and Ghost From The Past was a good support (a negate and a hand Shuffle/discard), but it was too late for it to enter the Meta and with Lavalval Chain being banned cause it doesn't specifies for lavals how it should be, there's less options for the deck. So I want to share what I've found through all this time with the current cards for anyone who wants to try it.  The idea of this deck is that you can do a plague in 1 turn with the correct setup. here are some examples of combos. (You can do a rekindling or Birth of The Prominence Flame after any of the next moves):  1) Molten Conduction Field + Rekindling: - The classic combo that can be stopped with a single Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. The idea is: - 1 Laval Archer and 1 Laval Volcano Handmaiden. - Then with effect of Laval Volcano Handmaiden search for the 2 copies and do the same. - At the 3rd copy, you can send a Laval Archer or Laval Lakeside Lady (if you already have a level 4 monster in the hand for normal summon). - Rekindling - Synchro summon T.G. Hyper Librarian. - Then, you can go for Crystron Halqifibrax with both Laval Volcano Handmaiden and search for a Laval Lakeside Lady and do a Synchro summon of Lavalval Salamander. - For next turn activate Crystron Halqifibrax in the opponent main phase to Synchro summon T.G. Wonder Magician - After you draw the card for the synchro summon, you can activate the effect of Wonder Magician to Summon Baronne de Fleur or Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying. - go crazy. At the end you should have at least 1 negate monster. If you are lucky, you can draw another Rekindling, Birth of the Prominence Flame or Left Arm Offering so you can extend the combo.  2) Special summon True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher/ Nine-Tailed Fox: - The condition for special summon from Agnimazud/Nine-tailed fox triggers the search for destroying Laval Volcano Handmaiden if you send it with another or have a Laval in the GY besides Handmaiden. Plus, you can vanish a card with Agnimazud from the Field or GY. You can even normal summon if you have a level 1 tuner in the hand (or Jet Synchron in the GY) for a quick 7 or 10 Synchro summon.  *Note: if you destroy Agnimazud from the hand or field with another card (Laval Archer effect from GY for example), it triggers the effect to add from the GY to the hand a ""Non- fire Wyrm"" so, in this case you can add Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda to the hand. In the case of Nine Tailed fox, Generates two tokens.  3) Tenyi Spirit - Mapura/ Laval Lakeside Lady, Laval Archer/ Laval Lakeside Lady or Tenyi Spirit - Mapura/ Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: - The idea is that you can do the synchro summon of Lavalval Salamander, send Laval Volcano Handmaiden (if it's in the hand) to the GY and do the combo or you can clean your hand for better cards. You can even do a little gamble looking for Handmaiden/Rekindling, but beware, cause you need at least 1 Fire Monster in the hand or say goodbye to it.  *Note: I know using Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring that way is not the best, but is a possibility for desperate times.  4) Gold Sarcophagus + Laval Cannon or Foolish Burial + Searing Fire Wall + Laval Cannon: - Banishing Laval Lakeside Lady with Gold Sarcophagus and with a normal summon of Laval Cannon you can do a easy level 7 synchro. Same with Searing Fire Wall and Foolish Burial, but you can go for a level 8 synchro thanks to the token.  5) Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda + Any Tuner: - A no brainer for a fast level 8 or 10 Synchro summon, just special summon Vishuda, then normal summon the tuner.  *Some notes or clarifications: - Mistake: there's only one card in the whole deck that search's and add to the hand so it's a good way to make them play at your level.  - Dustflame Blast: Panic button. Bear in mind that it doesn't let you chose how many monster you want to banish for the effect to work, so make it your last resort.  - Saryuja Skull Dread: if you want to and have the resources, you can clean your hand like with salamander, same but +1 in hand and the buffs and effects of saryuja are a great add on. You can even search draw for rekindling like this.  - Pot of Desires: YOU NEED THE EXTRA DECK, so other pots like duality, extravagance and Prosperity are not the best option. The idea is to play it once you have all the lavals on the GY, so you don't lose resources, but beware of banishing Rekindling, which is the main card for the deck. Once you have all the cards you need it doesn't matter what you banish. or in the worst case you can use it to try to save those bricks.  - Pot of Avarice: simple, handtraps and some synchro, DON'T TOUCH THE LAVALS. Remember that you need the resources for the panic button and the Rekindling, unless you have almost no cards in the hand.  - Searing Fire Wall: Used mostly as a second panic button for a defensive wall. Unlike Dustflame Blast you can choose what card you want to banish and how many so it's a plus in terms of strategic banish, like the example before with Laval Cannon. In case you want to play Quasar/Blazar, this is the replacement of boost warrior, why?, because it has so much potential and use unlike boost warrior who is only used for the combo, at least like these you have more opportunities for plays.  - Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying: The alternative to Baronne de Fleur, this card with Dustflame Blast, Searing Fire Wall, Gold Sarcophagus, Agnimazud, Pot of Avarice, Lakeside Lady, Birth of the Prominence Flame, Called by the grave or any card that banish does a good match for this card, and you end up banishing so much things that you can even go over some 4500 monster, plus, the banish to prevent destruction effect doesn't specify if it has to be a wyrm like the swordsoul archetype, so you can select a laval or any magic/trap card that you don't need.  Some alternatives:  -Number 60: Dugares The Timeless: For those 2 lvl 4 monster at first hand. Watch out for those ash blossom and remember that if you use the ""draw 2, discard 1"" you won't be able to draw in your next draw phase.  -Nine-Tailed Fox: Same use as Agnimazud, but it doesn't destroy from the hand so it a little hard to make it work. But you can play it with Agnimazud so you can Generate the tokens.  -Cosmic Blazar Dragon/Shooting Quasar Dragon: Being my preference Blazar, you can still make a spot for this card, but I don't play it cause uses too much resources for the little that does as 2-3 negates in field. I'm not saying is bad, but for me it's better to have 2 Negates than 1 omni negate.  -Flamvell Counter: being a card that says ""NOPE"" to spell/trap cards a cost from your resources is a good alternative, if you like to play Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon in the spot of F.A. Dawn Dragster you can use it. Even better, it works with Chengying.  -Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon: I Love this card, is a good way to make some defense if you don't have a good start, and it has 2 negates, 1 from a monster and 1 if a level 5 or higher monster will be targeted cause of a monster effect, Both effects which can help you in early or late game. You can switch it with F.A. Dawn Dragster, but you will have less defense against spell/traps."

They are the main negations because we don't have handtraps in this deck, and for a very obvious reason, it is very likely that they will be discarded by accident due to the effect of dangers.</span> <span>You can either come out first and try to get 38 and Apollousa on the table, or second and try an OTK by performing multiple invocations.</span> <span>Another interesting card is the Eradicator Epidemic Virus, it may seem like a silly card, but it has saved me in many duels and when we have opponents that rely heavily on traps or spells, this card is a great choice to end our opponent's advantage. I also preferred not to put Harpie's Feather Duster, I thought it might be interesting to put the twin twisters instead, because as a cost we will discard at least one card.</span>  <span>However, it may be more interesting for you to change the virus for Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite, I left it on the side, but it fits perfectly in the main deck, even better than the virus, because with it you can invoke it, preferably returning a danger and so use its effects again, or even a dark world if you have ways to discard it</span>  <span>Whenever possible, try to discard Sillva with Dragged Down Into the Grave, because in addition to having his special summon, you will make your opponent return two cards to the bottom of the deck.</span>  <span>Otherwise, I will create another list in the future for when the new structure deck devil's gate is released, because then we will have some more interesting card interactions.</span>"

I can't possibly think of a deck, or engine, that summons level 7s and doesn't like normal summo","<span><strong>This is an In-Depth look into Kshatri-La.</strong></span>  <span>The Kshatri-La's &amp; The Main Deck.</span>  <span>The Kshatri-La's all have similar effects, allowing you to search a Monster/Spell/Trap from the deck, and when the opponent uses a monster effect or when that Kshatri-La declares an attack, they can banish a card from the Field, Extra deck, and the Main Deck. In addition, they can summon themselves for free, when you control no monsters. They're very good for rank 7 spam, which gives them really good tech options. And, may as well say it now, Kshatri-La is a control deck, but it's actually quite fun. They allow a great resource loop, allowing you to banish the opponents extra deck, the cards from field, hand, gy, and top of the deck. They can also use a lot of level 7 engines in order to go into level 7 Xyz monsters, use hand traps to go into rank 10 Synchros, or go into Halq and Selene and Accesscode stuff. I'm going to go into almost every card and engine, as to why they're in here. </span>  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Kshatri-La Ogre"">Kshatri-La Ogre</a></span>  Kshatri-La Ogre adds a Kshatri-La trap from the deck to the hand, currently the only target being Kshatri-La Prepare. Prepare allows you to summon a Kshatri-La that's banished in in your hand, at spell speed 2. This isn't the best, but if you're trying to get more Kshatri-La's to banish more cards, this is a great way to do it. It also banishes a card from the opponents hand if the opponent activates a trap. This is mostly going to happen if the opponent is playing Infinite Impermanence, or possibly Floowandereeze. If the opponent is playing Floowandereeze, you  can use this trap to summon a card, banish a card from the opponents hand, like a hand trap or a tribute summon. It's not the best, no matter what you banish, since A. you're banishing it, and Toccan exists, and B. You can't banish the card Robina gets, since the way Kshatri-La's work is that they activate their effects after the trap/spell/monster effect has resolved. But it is still good, and worth playing. Who knows, maybe it's Eldlich. Ogre has the 2nd effect, when the opponent uses a monster effect or when it declares an attack, you can look at the top 5 cards of your opponents deck, and banish one of them.  This makes it so you can banish a card that could out the board, while also giving you information on what deck the opponent is playing. To note, this does not shuffle the deck, and this card will be banned in Remote Duels. I play this at 3, the trap isn't good, but it's a name, in a deck with only 3 of them, the banish effect is decent, and it has the most attack of any Kshatri-La main deck card. As for the trap, I play 2, because it's still a decent card, and it's good to have multiple if one is outted, but you could play 1.  <span><a data-name=""Kshatri-La Unicorn"">Kshatri-La Unicorn</a></span>  Unicorn adds a Spell to hand, with the only target being Kshatri-la Berth. Berth is a monster reborn for the deck, allowing you to summon a Kshatri-La from the GY or Banished zone. It also allows a Kshatri-La to be normal summoned without tributing, and when the opponent uses a spell card, banishes 3 cards from the opponents GY. So, in one card, it's a Reborn, a free normal summon of any Kshatri-La, to help spam them out, and then a D.D. Crow. This card is pretty good. Going back to Unicorn, when it attacks, or an opponents monster uses an effect, it can do one of the best effects in the game, and look at the opponents extra deck, and banish it. This is the reason to play the deck. If the opponent is a synchro deck, banish Halq. Therion P.U.N.K., banish Chaos Ruler. Branded Despia, pray to god they have one Mirrorjade/Albion/Lubellion, and if not, Chimera I guess. For me personally, definitely a 3 of. As for the spell this card searches, definitely play 2 of it. It's a really good spell, and you always want it in rotation.  &nbsp;  <span><a data-name=""Kshatri-La Fenrir"">Kshatri-La Fenrir</a></span>  <span>Kshatri-La Fenrir is the ""Stratos"" of the deck, the main monster. He can summon himself, then search any Kshatri-La monster. Then, when the opponent uses a monster effect, or when he declares an attack, it can banish any face up card on the field. It's a 3 of for sure, and has some really nice interactions with one of the upcoming spells I'll talk about in a sec. This part of the guide to Kshatri-La isn't that long, due to me already covering the monsters. But this is absolutely a 3 of.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Danger! Engine</span>  <span><a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a></span>  We are playing a small danger engine in here, both for the Draw power, and for the ability to summon level 7s like Nessie for Xyz. There's 3 Nessie, 1 Chupacabra, and one Jackalope. 3 Nessie's since it's the best danger in this deck, and is a level 7, 1 Chupacabra, this is if we have a 1 card hand and it's just Nessie. You can use the Nessie, get Chupacabra, then ss the Nessie from the gy. You could play 2 or 3 Chupacabra, since it's a good way to keep Nessie in rotation, but I think it's much better to play just one. The same goes for Jackalope, both as just another Danger, and if we use it, discard itself, it just summons Nessie from deck. I considered playing Dogman, but it's just terrible. Doesn't search, ya it's a level 7, but it's just horrible.  <span>Adventurer Token Engine</span>  This engine is amazing in this deck. You do normal summon with the Berth, but most times, you're using that monster for Xyz material instantly, so it won't even matter. It also summons level 7s, meaning that in cases where you don't need an Illegal Knight or Gryphon, it's a level 7 Engine. I'm playing both Gryphon and Illegal knight, since it's good to have names, and multiple monsters due to hard opt. Also, the Interactions with Illegal Knight and Dracoback are just amazing. Theoretically, you can use Aquamancer to go into Selene and Accesscode, but that rarely comes up, but it's nice to keep that in mind.  <span>Ghost Ogre Engine</span>  <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a>  This engine doesn't technically exist, but I think I'll just make it up and say it does. Ghost ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit is a pretty good hand trap, able to destroy monsters/spells/traps when they activate their effects. It can stop Therions from using Discolosseum, in a mirror match it can destroy Kshatri-La's or their Spell/traps, and against Albaz, it can.. do.. something? I think? It's not great against Albaz, but it's decent. And against P.U.N.K. it can stop Ze Amin from being used as synchro material for Chaos Ruler to start their combos. But why is this an Engine? Well, notice that Ghost Ogre is a level 3 Psychic monster. You can summon this from Emergency Teleport, and then summon Ghost Ogre from the deck. This allows you to access both Baronne de Fleur, by using it and a Kshatri-La, or Halq into Accesscode by summon Veiler from the deck. And if you can't do either, and you have E-Tele and only that, you can summon Ghost Ogre anyways, since it can use its effect on field. There are 3 Synchro's you can summon with this engine, but I'll get to them later.  <span><a data-name=""Sacred Sword of Seven Stars"">Sacred Sword of Seven Stars</a></span>  This card is the other reason to play the deck. The first being Unicorn and the extra deck control, the 2nd reason is this card. You banish a level 7 from Hand or Field, draw 2. As far as this deck is concerned, it's pot of greed and special summon one from hand. It's fairly simple to understand why this is good. The deck is full of level 7s, banishing has no real cost, and the fact that you can banish from field can do some silly things. One ""Combo"" you can do with this is Sacred Sword and Fenrir. You summon Fenrir, search Unicorn, Sacred Sword, draw 2. Then you Summon Fenrir, get Berth, summon Fenrir with Berth, make a level 7. After that, you can summon any additional Kshatri-La's from hand with the normal summon effect of Berth. Once used in Dragon ruler as literally pot of greed but you draw one more card, now used in Kshatri-La where it's Pot of greed but you sometimes draw 2 more, since you make a 7, summon something from deck with Shangri-La, then search if you summon Ogre from Berth.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Extra Deck</strong></span>  <span>The Synchros.</span>  As of now, there are 3 really playable level 10 Synchro's. The first, obviously, is Baronne de Fleur. Omni Negate, once per turn destroy one, and if useful, reborn a card during the SP Phase. One thing you can do is use Baronne to summon from the gy after you use its negate, and bring back Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit. This allows you to use Ghost Ogre again to synchro into Baronne again, or summon one of the other synchros. The next synchro is Ruddy Rose Dragon. If the opponent is playing a gy deck, this wins you the game. We don't care if our cards are banished, since we can summon them with Berth, and give Prepare a purpose, since they both summon from banished. But if the opponent is playing something like Eldlich, or another GY Focused deck, this can sometimes win you the game. The last card that I'll be talking about for the Synchro's are one of the Swordsoul synchro's, Chengying. If the opponent has a lot of banished cards, say 10 or more, this can be used for OTKs, and to get in for a lot of damage. It also has protection, and then banishes from the opponents field &amp; Gy if something is banished.  <span>The Link Monsters</span>  For the Link monsters, there's not much in terms of ""Spicy Tech Choices."" I just use a standard Halq, Selene, and Accesscode lineup for an otk. This is one of the reasons for the Ghost Ogre &amp; E-Tele Engine, as Ghost Ogre and and monster turns into a 5300 that destroys 2 cards.  <span>The Xyz Monsters</span>  These are the main extra deck cards, and there's a bit of variety in here. First, the Kshatri-La Xyz Monster, Shangri-La. 0 Attack, 3k Defence, so a reverse link monster, and this card is insane. It summons a Kshatri-La from deck during the Standby Phase, it has protection by detaching a material, and whenever a card is banished, it blocks a zone from being used. This is the 3rd reason to play the deck, as locking the zones is amazing this format. As soon as you get 3 monster zones locked, you basically win the game. It can also summon a Kshatri-La from deck, so you can summon Fenrir or Unicorn to banish from field or the Extra deck respectively, while also allowing you to search for cards when it gets to your turn. The next card in the Xyz list is Number 89: Diablosis the Mind hacker. This allows you to continue the Extra deck control by banishing one card from it, and in the late game, allows you to banish cards from the top of your opponents deck equal to the amount of banished cards your opponent has. This allows you to possibly mill their deck if you're late in the game, banishing up to 10 cards from the opponents deck. Ya, that's basically a desires, but they don't draw two, and you can possibly mill swordsoul cards, Fusion spells, Therions, Ze Amin, the cards that need to stay in the deck.  Next on the list is Number 11: Big Eye. Generic materials, and allows you to take any monster the opponent controls. They control Mirrorjade that's already been used? It's yours now! They control a regulus after they've used their negate? Take it. Really good for breaking boards, and a must include for the deck. Next on the list is F0 Utopic Future and F0 Utopic Future Draco. These are niche, but if you overlay a 2nd Shangri-La and the other rank 7 I haven't talked about yet, you can make a pretty good monster negate that steals, in a deck that lacks negates of any kind. This is Niche, but it can come up. Next on the list, Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus. This card is good in almost any deck that uses Xyz and battles, and this is perfect with one card in particular. The next card is probably the most interesting card in the list, Dark Anthelion Dragon. It is a pendulum, so ring the Pend alarm. Generic Materials, 3k Attack, and has a really good battle phase effect. It can detach a material, halve an opponents monsters attack, then gain the attack. This is a quick effect, which means you can do damage step shenanigans. It also helps for OTK's by being able to deal 3k damage to your opponent, and combine that with your Kshatri-La's for easy OTK's. This is also amazing for Zeus, since it can always run over a card the opponent controls. Unless it's a Psychic End Punisher, Arrival Cyberse @Ignister, or a Crooked Cook. Otherwise, this is an easy Zeus line, with good OTK potential. But, if the opponent has a negate for this that also destroys it, it sets itself in the pend zone. While there, it does have a pretty good pend effect. Once per turn, just halve the attack of an opponents monster. This allows you to beat over the opponents boss monsters by halving them, then summoning Kshatri-La's and Adventurer tokens.  <strong><span>Final Notes</span></strong>  The deck is a really good control deck, allowing use of really good engines, rank 7s, and level 10 Synchros. The games are fun with this deck, but admittedly, as soon as you start locking zones with Shangri-La, the game starts losing its fun. But I do think that this deck is good, the only thing that would be better is if we had Galaxy Tomahawk.  &nbsp;  P.S. The side deck can realistically be anything, the current side deck is just my personal side deck of choice for this format. Also, I tried adding pictures to the Deck Description, not sure if I did it right, hopefully it's not 50% pictures of Kshatri-La Ogre.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

A large benefit to this deck is that few cards in the current meta game can out apoqliphort towers as monsters like knightmare unicorn a very good counter to towers see little to no play in this meta game with branded, swordsoul and P.U.N.K. not using it. Also with the large reliance on high level boss monsters this format backed with low level starters the searchable Re-qliate feels extremely strong."

If you don't see skill drain, the effects on the tribute summon of stealth, helix and carrier will help you deal with your opponent's board. Scout can search the other qliphort monsters thanks to its effect and monolith recovers your resources by drawing cards when you tribute summon up the number of monsters you tribute. Lose 1 Turn is there because it synergizes a lot with the archetype as the effects of the main deck qliphort monsters are on tribute summon and the cards only affect special summoned monsters. Cards like dark ruler no more, monarch stormforth and harpie's feather duster are there to make life easier going second as this deck really wants to go first. Feel free to change the ratio of the monsters and to try different floodgates.  About this deck keep in mind that it was released in the ARC-V era when pendulum decks used to be able to special summon many monters from the extra-deck instead of one. Qliphort genius is a good way to play around that as it opens up two extra monster zone and searches a qliphort when yu pendulum summon two qliphort monsters from the extra. However, keep in mind it will not be unaffected by skill drain if skill drain was alrady on the field before you link summoned it.  Towers is not played because while it's not completely terrible it suffers from the fact that link monsters exists. Although not all decks play those many still do. Also it's very unlikerly you'll be able to summon it turn one considering hand-traps exist."

Is Mechaba even still good? (Hey, Mechaba is pretty good!)","See, sometimes good things come from playing with silly ideas!  This is kind of the natural ""try-hard"" evoltion of Live AID, a deck that was produced out of not feeling like the Invoked and Dogmatika engines really filled out a deck enough, and a bad pun. But it got me thinking about Aleister, and about how to actually round out the deck, and got me looking at packages. In the end I decided on trying the P.U.N.K. engine. Here, it is making Halq into Herald of the Arc Light plus an 8. This is kind of neato, actually, in that this deck can actually make almost all of it's Dogmatika bricks profitably, and allows for Mechaba to protect Halq, creating Nibiru resilience. It also actually can make plays! Yay!  I feel like the card-by-card should be pretty self explanatory. You're a sort of combo/control deck trying to draw Nadir Servant, Aleister the Invoker, and Emergency Teleport, and then you win by using your one for one interruptions really well. You're basically a Control shell that occasionally makes 4 negates + Punishment, so the real trick to playing the deck is knowing chokepoints, having matchup and meta knowledge, and applying it correctly. Since this is a hidden information game with incredible complexity and an eternal format over 20 years old, that will be difficult for newer players, but if you have a little bit of experience this deck could do you pretty well, and occasionally it will just ""full combo"" and take over a game, something a lot of control decks can struggle to do.  Savage and Herald never came up, wheras I think Accesscode will, and VFD definitely does. This list is spicy, this is a very wacky pile, and I'm still improving with it, but you're basically playing a very non-linear deck that has some combo hands and some control hands and some hands that do both, and it is explosive and flexible, so I'm enjoying it. Very much my style of pile.  I cut an Ecclesia and one Cosmic for a lone Skull Meister (very good in simplified game states), and an Ogre Dance (the lack of Ogre Dance was coming up, where you'd see Foxy Tune as your starter but not be able to play with just Foxy Tune. Now you can, and you also see Baronne + Auroradon slightly more often and Dogmatika slightly less, so you're bricking on Dogmatika and P.U.N.K. less with these numbers, and playing more towards the explosive hands than control. 3 Cosmic was fine, but I was seeing it just slightly too often, and I wanted to diversify. Meister has always impressed me so long as it is my second hand trap, but even with the minor conflict between Imperm and Gamma the deck is running 13 hand traps plus a handful of board breaking cards, so I suspect Meister will be good as a one-off tech card."

If you like to check my older build, you can find it here: https://ygoprodeck.com/spirits-of-the-forest-traptrix-deck/  In the current meta, add these cards: Lord of the Heavenly Prison x2, Gallant Granite x1, Traptrix Cularia x1, Traptrix Vesiculo x1 and Pot of Prosperity x3. Lord of the Heavenly Prison is for backrow protection, a 3k beater that can set any spell and trap directly from the deck. Gallant Granite is to add Lord of the Heavenly Prison to hand. The Traptrix are new addition that are usually run. Pot of Proesperity will help a lot with consistency. You can change whatever you like to add these cards.  For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more.

Why is that ? Cause Borrelend-Dragon took everything away maids had over Dragonlink: The grindgame with a boss monster that negates and floods the board. Even worse, Borrelend is stronger, easier to make and cuter.  But lets focus on the idea behind this new kind of Pendulum Dragonlink deck aka Beyond Dragonlink.  While cards like Odd-eyes revolution, Chaos emperor and Supreme King have all three been on and off tech choices for dragonlink, it was rarely because of their pendulum gameplay and rather cause of them being good chaos enabler or just free extender. With this list this changes....well not completly, we still use them also as free extender and chaos enabler.  The gameplan of the deck doesnt stray to far from what Dragonlink wants to do, make borrelend + 1-2 negates, a set up gy for grind and in best case also a sphere to loop a card back. Just that in this version there is a few more lines that can end with you drowning in material , break hard boards and play through hand traps.  A slight warning before we go in the card by card though, this list is not perfect, specially the extra deck needs some smoothing out. But it is already able to compete with current decks on a decent level.  We will split the deck in 3 Parts : Pendulum, Chaos , and Rokkets  The pendulum work best hand in hand with the rokkets, your favorite hand will always be Ravine + either Absorouter or Supremeking Dark. You will discard one, to send the other and have freely the choice to now go all out with rokket lines or pendulum lines.  Its really hard to put this deck in words on how to play it, and I would recommend to just try things out for yourself and get a feeling for it as it doesnt play linear at first but after you get used to including pendulum lines , it will get a lot simpler to pilot.  If there is interest I will try to put down a few endboards and how to get there of cause, but for now I wanted to just get this list out and hopefully find some people who try and give it their own spin until its polised and clean."

The best use of Pyros I can come up with and a very fun non-meta dec,"So this is the final build of a Volcanics deck that I have been working on as a fun, fiery casual/decent non-meta deck where I tried my damnedest to make Pyros playable. I don't think this deck will win you a lot of tournaments, and it won't have a flashy OTK or huge boss monster, but I rate it 10/10. The deck is extremely fun to play with an emphasis on using resources effectively and playing one step ahead of your opponent to stay alive. The main strategy is to use the volcanic engine to wipe the opponent's monsters and whittle down their life points and resetting it to go again with RFG and POA. The secondary strategy to fill out the rest of the deck is using Rekindling targets to get access to the extra deck through synchros (or links). You can consistently send the synchro material you need to the grave with Canoneer, Foolish burial, and the volcanic engine, while consistently bring them back with rekindling, call of the haunted, and monster reborn. This consistency makes the deck often run like a well-oiled machine, though it can occassionally get bricked with rekindling targets in hand, there is enough card draw and deck filtering through the volcanic combo and resets that this is a fairly rare outcome. I also run mirror force and magic cylinder for protection if I cannot get scattershot's effect off for some reason, and to keep my opponent guessing as to whether or not they should risk destroying set traps as Blaze Accelerator Reload can be activated from the graveyard. Ogre is my hand trap of choice because this deck struggles most against monster-heavy decks that can rebuild their boards and because ash blossom is not in my budget. Magic planter can be used to send a BAR to the grave for great value and helps Call of the haunted pull double duty as it is not destroyed if the monster it summoned is used as summoning material. Finally, change of heart can be used to use an opponent's monster against them to finish them off and easily removed though link or synchro summoning.  The extra deck is a little different and will be used as a last resort and finishing move. Knightmare cards work great as easy to summon answers to single cards at the cost of discarding a card (usually a monster that can be recurred later). But the main focus is using Formula Synchron and T.G Hyper Librarian to set up for synchroing into bigger cards, namely Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon and Shooting Star T.G. EX. or Shooting Star Dragon These cards are threats that need to be answered and can answer nearly any threat your opponent has on field. Easy access to tuners through rekindling and non-tuners through the volcanic engine means that despite not having cards that search other materials specifically, this deck can still consistently achieve whatever extra deck play you need to stay alive and take the game. Bonus Option: Look for uses of your opponents' cards as materials with Monster reborn and change of heart Finally for the Side Deck we have access to more board wipe cards if your opponent sports tons of creatures but no protection, MST if your opponent plays more back row, other hand traps like effect veiler and Nibiru if Ghost Ogre isn't your style, and magic cylinder if your opponent uses single boss monsters or you just want to end the game as fast as possible. When swapping out for side deck ideally you would trade traps for traps, keeping what is most effectively going to counter your current matchup. Removing any monsters throws off the balance of various level markers needed to get the ideal synchos off, and cards like shell and scattershot require you to run 3 of each. The Spells run in this deck are what extend your plays with card draw, resets, fetches, and your best forms of recursion so I also recommend leaving those alone."

Full Chazz it up from 10 to 10,000.","The point of the deck is to end on either A-Z Buster Cannon or Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon.  The best play is to go second so that you can crash Ojama Blue into your opponent's monster to search two Ojama cards, first adding Ojamatch and Ojamagic and later adding two Ojamasimilation. Since it's 2022, your opponent will likely have a board of monster negates to stop ojama blue, that is where Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet can help out. Rescue cat is the best opener for the deck, allowing you to summon two Ojama Blues from the deck, allowing you to go plus 4 fromthe two searches and plus three when discarding Ojamagic.  If you want to play this on Master Duel, Replace one ABC Buster Dragon with Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

If your opponent has out DPE the racoon token itself will be at 4000 ATK with just one copy of solidaridy. It continues to stack higher and higher each token you make. it gets pretty silly with multiple racoons and multiple solidaridy even the boost from missus radiant is nothering to laugh at. So if your looking for a deck to suprise OTK and have insanely hilarious tokens play this deck. Also a side note Fabled Unicore is called the NOOBMUNCHER because if u fail to read his effect it can cause some game changing mistakes on their end. If im not mistaken last i checked Fabled Unicore has the fastest Spell speed negation of any monster as he can negate counter traps. pretty dope

It improves consistency quite a bit, and allows for easy acces to any Suship-Xyz that you need. You run 3 Unexpected Dai to get a free Shari and 3 Painful Decision to get easy acces to Aka-Shari. Aka-Shari is arguably more valuable in the hand, as it can special summon itself and then go into any of the Suship XYZ with a material from deck.  The Suship XYZ have no effects that require a discard, which opens up opportunities to use some of the XYZ-Cards. Sadly most of them are bad, except for 2 (and an honorable mention): <ul>  	<li>XYZ-Remora: Detach 2 materials from an XYZ and special summon it. If you have 2 Fish-Monsters in GY you can then Special summon them, but they can only be used for Fish-XYZ (or links). No HOPT. Only problem: The Suships aren't fish, for whatever reason. And not WATER. They are fire, <strong>for some reason...</strong> Still, a great extender to go into Dweller, Emeral or Tornado Dragon.</li>  	<li>XYZ-Gift: If you have 2 XYZ-Monsters you can detach 2 materials to draw 2 cards. <strong>No OPT.</strong> It can make mediocre hands good and good hands great, but at the same time it makes bad hands worse.</li>  	<li>Honorable Mention: XYZ Block: A counter trap that negates the activation of a monster effect and destroysit by detaching 1 Material. No OPT. If only it were for Spell/Traps, because you usually go into Nummer F0, which already negates monster effects. So it is farily obsolete.</li> </ul> What's also great about these cards is that they are all searchable with Generation Force, which is also not OPT.  I only run 2 Supper Spot and 2 Daily Special because they can brick up your hand a lot and they are searchable with Shirauo-Class Carrier.  Sadly there is not much room for Handtraps in this build, so I only run 3 Imperm because it is a great, versatile card.  The one Avarice is for extension/recovery because you can get quite a few materials in the GY"

Click to see how you start the combo.,"D/D/D may be considered to be one of the most difficult decks to play with in the history of the YuGiOh! card game. Before trying this deck out in a tournament or online ranking, please practice multiple times to get a better understanding of the mechanics. After enough plays, building strong boards will feel like muscle memory.  The bet cards to have in your opening hand is Savant Kepler, Savant Copernicus, Griffon, and Swirl Slime. Kepler will add Dark Contract with the Gate to add any of the monsters mentioned that aren't already in our hand. Use Swirl Slime to Fusion summon Flame King Genghis with Griffon as the second material. Use Slimes effect to summon Copernicus, allowing you to summon Griffon from the graveyard and send either Ghost, Lamia, or Orthros to the grave. When Griffon is summoned, add to your hand D/D/D Headhunt or Necro Slime/Vice Typhon. Then use Copernicus and Griffon to Link Summon Abyss King Gilgamesh. Use Gilgamesh to set the pendulum scales with Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok and either Divine Zero King Rage or Destiny King Zero Laplace. Due to this effect however, you can only summon D/D monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. Good thing that's all you got!  From there, there are a number of end board you and finish with depending on your recourses. The best end board you can end on from their is High Wave King Caesar (2 summon negates), Cursed King Siegfried (spell and trap negate), Deviser King Deus Machinex (2 XYZ imprort), and D/D/D Headhunt (Monster negate and Change of Heart).  D/D/D is a difficult deck to play and even harder to teach. I'll try to make a video of the deck to better show the combos in to foreseeable future. If you have any questions, leave a comment and follow me for more deck profiles."

You get a good graveyard and set up the traps you want and pass, a combination of gravekeeper’s trap, flower buds, lost sanctuary, and the divine punishment lost sanctuary provides will hopefully let you hold out until you can etch out a win.  That’s about it! It’s incredibly consistent considering the sheer amount of searchers there are but optimizing the endboard is a different case.  Also if you want an idea of how consistent this deck is here:  3 Copies of World Carbon provides any earth fairy in the game for your normal summon (which you really don’t need)  given a discard is available the three seedlings and haze can grab any earth fairy  3 Hills and blooms can search any vernalizer card  Keldo can search anything relating to exchange of the spirit  Mudora sets up gravekeepers trap which can also search any earth fairy"

","So, for starters, this is my first deck. Don't expect it to be great. Secondly, the decks main focus is to link summon ""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"" using all three Nephthys ritual cards. The combo will look a little something like this  1. Use ""Pre-preparation Of Rites"" to search for ""Conductor of Nephthys"", or if you already have it in your hand to search out ""Devotee of Nephthys""  2. Ritual summon ""Conductor of Nephthys""  3. Use ""Conductor of Nephthys"" effect to special summon ""Cerulean Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys""  4. Use ""Drytron Alpha Thuban"" effect to get ""Devotee of Nephthys"" into your hand  5. Ritual summon ""Devotee of Nephthys""  6. Link summon ""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame""  This is the ideal scenario you want however it can go a bit wrong, that is why ""Diviner of the Herald"" and ""Cyber Angel Benten"" are in the deck. In case you don't know how to use ""Diviner of the Herald"", you will Normal Summon it, then use it's effect to send ""Herald of the Arc Light"" from your Extra Deck to your graveyard, then use it's effect in your graveyard to add the missing component you need into your hand. ""Cyber Angel Benten"" simply allows you to add ""Diviner of the Herald"" to your hand if it's used for a Ritual Summon.  &nbsp;"

Youtube link inside","Attention Synchro players! Auroradon ban and Halqifibrax limit got you down? Worry no more, since the next evolution of Synchro-pile-goodstuff finds itself in it’s next evolution – PUNK Adventure Therion!  Since the release of Dimension Force, powerups to the PUNK and Adventure archetypes allowed more powerful boards to be created and more answers to annoying floodgates like Artifact Scythe. The introduction of the “Therion” archetype also boosted decks such as ABC Dragon Buster or Sunavalon to meta relevance mostly because of its famous omni-negate, Therion Regulus. This deck uses the strengths of all three archetypes to create one cohesive, super strong strategy! <p></p> <p><span><strong>ARCHETYPES, ENGINES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></span></p>                 As the deck’s name implies, this deck has three main archetypes smushed together – PUNK, Adventurer and Therion. Staples cards form the rest of the cards in the deck: <ul>  	<li>The <strong>PUNK</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 11 cards:</li> </ul> <em>3 Emergency Teleport, 3 Ze Amin, 2 Ogre Dance, 2 Foxy Tune and 1 Deer Note</em>. In the Extra deck, there is <em>1 Amazing Dragon</em>. These cards form the basis of this deck’s main combo lines.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The <strong>Adventurer</strong>cards in the Main Deck consist of 11 cards:</li> </ul> <em>3 Aquamancer of the Sanctuary, 3 Rite of Aramesia, 1 Wandering Gryphon Rider, 1 Illegal Knight, 1 Fateful Adventure, 1 Dracoback and 1 Foolish Burial</em>. The Adventurer cards are used in this strategy to provide blanket protection and bait from interruption – allowing your PUNK combo to work successfully.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The <strong>Therion</strong> cards in the main deck consist of 13 cards:</li> </ul> <em>3 Discolosseum, 1 Terraforming, 3 Endless Engine Argyro System, 2 “King” Regulus, 1 “Lily” Borea, 2 “Duke” Yul and 1 “Reaper” Fum. </em>The Therion cards are also used to insulate the PUNK combo from interruption, mostly through Regulus’ omni-negate. The Therion monsters can also be used as extra bodies for Synchro/XYZ plays.  &nbsp;  <em>There are other sets of cards in this deck that support their boss monster, or the strategy as a whole: </em>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The <strong>Staple</strong> cards in the maindeck consists of 15 cards:</li> </ul> <em> </em>  <em>The handtraps are 3 Psyframe Gamma and 1 Driver. 3 Effect Veiler. </em>Not many handtraps are in this deck, since it can naturally play through opponent’s interruption quite easily. All handtraps are light, since they can be excavated by Chaos Ruler. Effect Veiler is also a target for Halqifibrax, which then can be used to create Accesscode through Selene for quick OTKs.  &nbsp;  <em>The spell staples are 3 Triple Tactics Talent, 1 Called by the Grave and 1 Forbidden Droplet. Triple Tactics Talent</em> is excellent this format because of the abundance of handtraps and on-field monster threats that always render this card live. <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> is also amazing in this deck, since many of the cards don’t mind being sent to the GY (I only have 1 in my list since I can’t afford anymore, feel free to add more Droplets).  &nbsp;  <em>The two Halqifibrax target tuners in this deck are Plaguespeader Zombie and Jet Synchron. </em>These tuners can make certain boss monsters like Baronne De Fleur and Swordsoul Chengying, given the right set-up. These cards can also make Accesscode Talker, since they can summon themselves from the GY at the cost of 1 card in hand.  &nbsp;  The last staple is <em>Fairy Tail – Snow</em>, which is a target to be sent to the GY with Shooting Riser Dragon. This makes Riser Dragon level 3, enabling Level 10 or 11 Synchro plays available during your opponent’s turn.  &nbsp;  This deck is 50 cards so that there is the least possible chance to draw into this deck’s 7 hard/soft bricks: Wandering Gryphon Rider, Illegal Knight, Psy-Frame Driver, Fairy Tail – Snow, Jet Synchron, Plaguespreader Zombie and PUNK Deer Note. Keep in mind that many of these bricks don’t’ mind being discarded to the GY as part of your combo, so they can still be somewhat used if you hard draw them. While drawing most bricks wouldn’t be catastrophic, it is less than ideal – hence the 50 card deck.  &nbsp;  I intentionally didn’t include Artifact Dagda/Scythe combo in here, since I anticipate it will be on the future banlist. I also want my opponent to be able to duel since the fun in Yugioh for me is back-and-forth play, hence no scythe lock. (That’s just my personal taste, feel free to play Scythe in your strategy!)  &nbsp;  A card to add for consideration in PUNK Adventurer Therion is <em>Small World</em>, since it easily searches combo pieces, but that would require more research and experimentation. Another engine to add can be Illusion of Chaos + Magician Souls for extra draw power and another free body on board. Finally, other duelists add the Rose Dragon Package for more extension and plays. <p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p>                 The gameplan with this deck is to pull off the PUNK combo successfully, insulated by the Therion and Adventurer cards. From there, boss monsters such as Baronne, Psychic End Punisher and Accesscode are turbo’d out to control the game or close out the duel.  Ideally, this deck likes to go first so it can make a board, interrupt the opponent, then OTK the turn afterwards. Going second this deck can shrug off interruption, clear the board and deal lethal by generating multiple high ATK monsters.  <strong>GOING FIRST</strong>, Punk Adventurer Therion amasses as many negates (Baronne, Gryphon Rider, Regulus) as possible while protecting it’s “towers” monster, Psychic End Punisher. While not always available, Halqifibrax is set-up as well, providing follow-up and interruption through quick synchro.  <strong>T</strong>he Punk Adventurer Therion Pilot’s board is hand-dependent and flexible. Sometimes you only have access to some engines, and other times your opening hand has everything. Certain boss monsters may be available because of extra bodies you have on board. For ex. If you lots of level 8s, you can make Baronne with Halq -&gt; Plaguespreader Zombie or keep extending by overlaying two level 8s to make The Zombie Vampire. This means that this deck is not a linear one-trick-pony, and you can choose how you want to optimally play!  Everybody already knows the Adventurer and Halq/Accesscode combo, so I’ll only be explaining the PUNK combos. (Shoutout to Tune World from YouTube for these combos!)  <strong>P.U.N.K Ze Amin + Discard -&gt; Amazing Dragon + Psychic End Punisher or Halqifibrax (For Quick Synchro):</strong> <ol>  	<li>Activate Ze Amin’s search effect to get Foxy Tune from deck.</li>  	<li>Activate Foxy Tune from hand and discard a card to summon Deer Note from deck.</li>  	<li>Synchro away Ze Amin + Deer Note -&gt; Chaos Ruler. Chain Link 1 Chaos Ruler to excavate 5 and Chain Link 2 Deer Note to resurrect Ze Amin (If you want to make a rank 8 with Chaos Ruler, resurrect Foxy Tune instead).</li>  	<li>Synchro away Ze Amin + Chaos Ruler to make Amazing Dragon.</li>  	<li>Banish 1 Dark and 1 Light to summon Chaos Ruler from GY. Use Amazing Dragon’s effect to summon Ze Amin from GY.</li>  	<li>With Ze Amin + Chaos Ruler, you can either make a Halqifibrax for next turn’s quick synchro or make a Psychic End Punisher.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  If there are extra bodies left on board after the combo (like spent Therions who already used their effect), I tend to make a Halqifibrax to summon a tuner from deck to make a particular boss monster that fits the situation. Most times, I summon Plagespreader Zombie to synchro it with a level 8, making Baronne de Fleur. Alternatively, Halqifibrax can tag out next turn -&gt; Shooting Riser Dragon, which dumps from deck Fairy Tail Snow making it level 3. The level 3 Shooting Riser Dragon can quick synchro into Psychic End Punisher with the level 8 on board.  &nbsp;  Another option with this combo is using the 2 level 8s on board (Foxy Tune + Chaos Ruler) to create The Zombie Vampire. Many of this deck’s resources and follow-up exist in the GY, and another mill of 5 cards is invaluable to this strategy. This card can also resurrect a monster sent to the GY through its effect, so it also can access Halqifibrax if you resurrect a tuner. You may even get lucky and resurrect a Regulus, putting an omni-negate on the field. Usage of The Zombie Vampire’s effect may backfire though, since your opponent may like having their deck milled to the GY.  <u> </u>  <strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, PUNK Adventurer Therion can usually shrug off disruptions, as long it’s not 5+ omni-negates. Cards like Triple Tactic Talents and Psy-Frame Gamma also break boards and generate advantage, once you bait a monster interruption, swinging the game in your favour. Once your opponent is cracked wide open, then you can play as intended with your PUNK combo.  &nbsp;  If you are held down by floodgates, this deck has a built-in floodgate buster in the form of Dracoback. Bounce their card away, and keep on dueling!  &nbsp;  This deck can even play through scythe lock, since Adventurer and Therion both don’t need the Extra Deck to function. PUNK can also summon beefy monsters like Foxy Tune, Ogre Dance and Deer Note without even needing the Extra Deck!  &nbsp;  If you feel confident you can OTK, this deck can play through interruptions, generate 8000+ ATK and easily clear the board through it’s many removal options like Gryphon Rider/Illegal Knight’s bounce, Psychic End’s banish, and Accesscode’s multiple pops so you can swing for game!  &nbsp; <p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li>Before you start off with your opening plays, try to bait out your opponent’s handtraps/interruption by using the Adventurer and Therion cards first. Once your opponent bites down, Triple Tactics Talent and Psy-Frame Gamma punish them!</li>  	<li>The cards in this deck discard A LOT (Fateful Adventure, “Lily” Borea, Foxy Tune). Be sure to discard cards that like being in the GY!</li>  	<li>A Baronne with a spent negate can tag back into Gryphon Rider during Standby Phase for another omni-negate, given that the Adventurer Token is still on the field. Also, if you want to play offensively, she can tag back into a tuner you can make Halq -&gt; Accesscode!</li>  	<li>Psychic End Punisher is an extremely potent card that may singlehandedly win a match vs. an unprepared opponent. If this card is your win condition, turbo it out and watch your opponent fall to an UNAFFECTED monster that continually increases it’s attack!</li>  	<li>This deck loses hard to common floodgates like Gozen Match, Skill Drain and Mystic Mine. This deck’s native answer to these floodgates is Dracoback. If facing a floodgate-based opponent, be sure to side in backrow removal.</li>  	<li>While shrugging off most handtraps, this deck is crippled when faced with Droll &amp; Lockbird and Dimension Shifter. D.D Crow hurts as well, since certain cards are needed in the GY for this deck’s engine to function.</li>  	<li>If playing a long grind game, the Therion cards offer the best recursion, especially if Discolosseum is on the field. Repeating high ATK monsters + an omni-negate every turn is usually enough to pummel an opponent to submission.</li> </ul> <p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p>                 Behold, the ultimate deck that Grand Creators has to offer – PUNK Adventure Therion! Able to play through negates, floodgates and consequently OTK has led PUNK and it’s many variants to meta relevancy! Since the ban of Auroradon, Synchro pile decks have received a big blow to their power, but with the release of Dimension Force PUNK has taken the mantle of being the premier synchro strategy!  This is my personal version of the deck, and I’m super happy with how it turned out since its very fun to play and it’s competent enough to compete with stronger decks like Flundereeze, Swordsoul and Branded Despia. Me, an incompetent Yugi-Boomer, finally took a winning undefeated score in Locals with this deck. WOOHOOO!  I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online and IRL. And with that, I’m taking this deck to Locals this week, wish me luck! That’ll be all for now, GLHF Duelists!"

An in archetype way was made possible with the release of <a data-name=""Tailwind of Gusto"">Tailwind of Gusto</a>. It adds another Gusto Spell/Trap from the deck to your hand by discarding 1 Wind type monster from your hand (Adding itself or Contact with Gusto as the other target). Another way is to discard it by the effects of other cards such as <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> or even <a data-name=""Mariamne, the True Dracophoenix"">Mariamne, the True Dracophoenix</a> in a True Draco version.  After using the effect there are many ways of summoning Daigusto Sphreez such as through a <a data-name=""Gusto Vedir"">Gusto Vedir</a> or <a data-name=""Pilica Descendant of Gusto"">Pilica Descendant of Gusto</a> line. With <a data-name=""Daigusto Sphreez"">Daigusto Sphreez</a>'s effect you can add Gusto Griffin back from the GY and set up the same combo for the next turn with <a data-name=""Tailwind of Gusto"">Tailwind of Gusto</a>.  &nbsp;  <b>Pilica Descendant of Gusto and the Witches:</b>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//7/78/PilicaDescendantofGusto-PRIO-EN-SR-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  Both Pilica and Windwitches share the same ish flaw. They both Wind Lock you in different ways. However both halves of the deck want to Synchro spam so it is negligible in actual duel but limits your deck building a lot. Unless you need to go into <a data-name=""Number 3: Cicada King"">Number 3: Cicada King</a> which could be a problem if you are under <a data-name=""Windwitch - Ice Bell"">Windwitch - Ice Bell</a>'s effect.  You are also able to summon back <a data-name=""Windwitch - Glass Bell"">Windwitch - Glass Bell</a> after she hits the graveyard with Pilica's effect for a quick LV7 Synchro play or <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> if you have access to <a data-name=""Gusto Vedir"">Gusto Vedir</a> by his own extender effect or Tailwind of Gusto.  Pilica can also set you for the Griffin Loop after summoning a Gusto Vedir back with her effect then summoning Daigusto Sphreez.  Lastly depending on how you order your sends to the graveyard and how you made use of <a data-name=""Gusto Vedir"">Gusto Vedir</a> by either extension or normal summoning you can also special summon <a data-name=""Gusto Falco"">Gusto Falco</a> (That you sent with Vedir's <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> effect) with Pilica's effect while already having a Gusto Vedir on the field. After doing so you can either go for <a data-name=""Accel Synchro Stardust"">Accel Synchro Stardust</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Accel Synchro Stardust&quot;&gt;Accel Synchro Stardust&lt;/a&gt; Dragon""> Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> for more negates and a way to add a card back from the GY.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>I am not locked into Wind. WE ARE! </span></strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/e/e0/MapleMaiden-BACH-EN-C-1E.png/450px-MapleMaiden-BACH-EN-C-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  Having easy and quick access to LV7 Synchros enables us to make use of <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a>'s amazing effect declaring ""Wind"".  Coupled with <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> this combo is pretty much a <a data-name=""Number 4: Stealth Kragen"">Number 4: Stealth Kragen</a> floodgate. Coupled with <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> and a Negate can be pretty hard to out.  This part of the deck is easily swappable if you need more handtraps like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. This combo becomes a lot worse if your opponent is also on a Wind strategy making it redundant.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Sphreez OTK:</strong></span>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//d/dc/DaigustoSphreez-HA06-EN-ScR-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  The most classic and well known way of playing this deck. The main concept it is to make use of <a data-name=""Daigusto Sphreez"">Daigusto Sphreez</a>'s reversal damage effect with your smaller Gusto monsters such as <a data-name=""Gusto Egul"">Gusto Egul and </a><a data-name=""Gusto Gulldo"">Gusto Gulldo</a> who can float and attack their big monsters. This line is significantly easier to perform with cards like Tailwind and Griffin which can summon Egul from the deck. And even more so if you decide to make use of/side in <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and <a data-name=""Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju"">Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju</a>.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Kryptonite:</span></strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//d/d9/PoisonousWinds-PHSW-EN-C-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  This deck is very weak against <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. She can stop Vedir, Tailwind, Ice Bell, Griffin... heavens forbid you had to discard another card other than Griffin for a <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a> search. You suddenly have to play with 3-4 cards in your oponer due to a very obvious and great Ash target. She is the Kryptonite. Sadly she is the most prevelant hand trap in Yu-Gi-Oh. Better get used to baiting and going for plan B. Usually it comes down to your opponent having a second/third hand trap or not for your follow up play after ""<strong>baiting</strong>"" the Ash. Surprisingly enough this deck also suffers a little against <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> as opposed to regular negation hand traps since you want your monsters and <a data-name=""Tailwind of Gusto"">Tailwind of Gusto</a> to stay on the field.  &nbsp;  <strong>Notable Extra Deck Options:</strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/1/10/DaigustoLaplampilica-DAMA-EN-SR-1E.png/450px-DaigustoLaplampilica-DAMA-EN-SR-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  There are a few extra deck monsters worth mentioning that I did not find space in this build. You would usually side out either <a data-name=""Daigusto Gulldos"">Daigusto Gulldos</a> or <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> for these but feel free to do any alterations as you see fit.  <a data-name=""Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen"">Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen</a> can be a powerful option but can limit some of your lines depending on when you summon it.  <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a> is a good monster to have in a lot of match ups. Being able to banish keycards from your opponent's graveyard is a very powerful interaction.  <a data-name=""Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu"">Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu</a> more reliable as the game goes but a little hard to set up on your first turn.  <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> is another card that you won't be summoning turn one much like Jiujiu but can be hard summoned once the GY is loaded. Otherwise, a great card.  <a data-name=""Daigusto Laplampilica"">Daigusto Laplampilica</a> can be easily summoned sharing the same star line as <a data-name=""Daigusto Sphreez"">Daigusto Sphreez</a>. Her protection effect does come up more often than you would expect. Especially useful for Sphreez OTK when you NEED to keep her safe from targeted negation or just in general. She can also set up your GY with different Gustos names/mats for a Sphreez summon. Such as sending <a data-name=""Caam, Serenity of Gusto"">Caam, Serenity of Gusto</a> and <a data-name=""Gusto Falco"">Gusto Falco</a> to the GY. Just be wary of Nibiru, the Primal Being.  <a data-name=""Totem Bird"">Totem Bird</a> just an one use Spell/Trap negate.  <a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara"">Hi-Speedroid Chanbara</a> for OTKs.  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Decklist:</span></strong></span>"

Bless Master Duel for Miscellaneousaurus being at 3 and Verte,"<p>Great going-first or second deck with some pretty saucy combos. General strategy and card descriptions might be added if people ask, more combos to come.</p><ul><li>This deck has some pretty crazy combo potential that only gets better as you become more familiar with the interactions&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u><a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a></u></strong></p><ul><li>Its effect is kind of complicated, you reveal a card in your hand, pick a 2nd card from the deck that <strong>only shares 1</strong> characteristic (ATK, DEF, Lv, Type, Attribute), and add a 3rd card to your hand that <strong>only shares 1</strong> characteristic (ATK, DEF, Lv, Type, Attribute) with the 2nd card.<ul><li>In this deck it works fairly simply because all the monsters you want to search are Dinosaur type. So if you have a Dino in hand you can select a Dino in deck to get to your 3rd card<ul><li>If you select Animadorned Archosaur or Ultimate Conductor Tyranno as your 2nd card, you can search any other Dino in your deck</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><u>Some Small World Routes (3rd card is what is added to your hand)</u><ul><li>Any Earth Dinosaur in hand &gt; Animadorned Archosaur or Ultimate Conductor Tyranno &gt; Whichever Earth Dinosaur you need (usually Souleating Oviraptor)</li><li>Animadorned Archosaur in hand &gt; Ash Blossom &gt; Miscellaneousaurus</li><li>Either PSY-Framegear in hand &gt; Ultimate Conductor Tyranno &gt; Whichever Earth Dinosaur you need (usually Souleating Oviraptor)</li><li>Token Collector in hand &gt; Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon &gt; Animadorned Archosaur or Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>General Strategy/Tips</strong></p><ul><li>If going first, your goal is to get as many interactions (negates, destroys, interruptions, special summons) as possible set up. This can sometimes mean leaving an extra Baby/Petite on the field or in hand while you have Lost World and UCT or DPE so you can summon an extra token if the first is destroyed to keep protection.</li><li>If going second, focus on trying to get 2 UCTs out on the same turn, even if that means sacrificing Verte or DPE as bait so you can get Double Evolution Pill or UCT to resolve.<ul><li>Just 2 UCTs can put out between 4500-9500 damage (depending on how many monsters they have) on an all defense-position board, or even more if some monsters are in attack-position. Plus it is very easy to get out additional low-level monsters to get enough damage for game.</li></ul></li><li>A big part of this deck when going first is learning when and which negate/interrupt to use for your opponent's effect. As a general rule, try to really maximize the impact of Evolzar Dolkka's negate-and-destroy effect as IMO it can have the most significant impact (don't forget it isn't limited to once per turn and plan accordingly).&nbsp;<ul><li>I usually use Verte as fuel for the first activation of DPE or UTC in a turn, and DPE as fuel for the second (unless you have a Baby/Petite or Token Collector in hand, in which case use that for UCT and Verte for DPE)</li></ul></li><li>DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ULTIMATE CONDUCTOR TYRANNO! Even if things are looking rough and your opponent has cleared most/all of your board, you have a second UCT in your deck that is extremely easy to summon on Turn 3. If you draw/have a Miscellaneousaurus, Animadorned Archosaur, Double Evolution Pill, or UCT, you can summon it. From there it can often clear your opponent's often sub-optimal field (from fighting through your 1st turn board) with its ability to attack and destroy or send to GY each monster once.<ul><li>Big beatsticks are not given enough respect in this format, as long as you can summon and protect them (Misc does a great job of this and is at 3 in Master Duel) they can still effectively clear an opponent's board.</li></ul></li><li>When comboing, keep track of how many ""destroys"" you have remaining (Souleating, Scrap Raptor, Archosaur, etc) as that determines how much combo you have left, and you usually want to make it so Giant Rex is the last card you summon off of Baby/Petite (unless its in hand).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Important Cards</strong></p><p><strong><a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is perhaps the most important card in the deck alongside Souleating. If its effect resolves you basically have free reign until you start Link summoning, as your Dinos are immune to all your opponent's activated effects (yes this means Nibiru, Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermanence, etc) even though they can still be activated. PLUS, its ability to banish from GY to special summon from deck is necessary for the base combo and can come in clutch turn 3 by getting you another Souleating and Giant Rex (just banish the Rex along with 2 others and Misc) which means free Dolkka or Abyss Dweller. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other main combo card in this deck. On summon effect is vital for getting Misc or Baby to your hand. Activated effect can be used to destroy a Babycerasaurus on the field to special summon another Babycerasaurus from your GY, or to activate Lost World by targeting a Juraegg Token. Also great Xyz and Synchro material.&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Giant Rex</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your classic combo extender, just make sure it gets to the GY so you can banish it with Double Evolution Pill, Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, or Miscellaneousaurus. Usually special summoned off of your last Babycerasaurus, then used for Link/Synchro summoning, then banished and special summoned back to the field, then used for Xyz summoning (usually the first material detached as well). Don't forget it <strong>can't</strong> attack directly when calculating if you have game or not. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bring Sword Soul meta-slaves down a peg with this underrated handtrap (I've had a fair share instantly dip when I activate its effect). It also combos perfectly with Lost World, giving you a free activation of Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon each turn a dino is summoned (even on your opponent's turn). It is also Lv.4 meaning you can use it to make Abyss Dweller or Tornado Dragon. It also works well with Ultimate Conductor Tyranno as you can destroy it for cost without worry as its effect activates from the GY as well as the hand. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;This card works well with cards such as Fossil Dig, Double Evolution Pill, Fusion Destiny, and Miscellaneousaurus's GY effect to protect them against Ash Blossom, or against a pre-emptive Maxx ""C"". If you manage to use it during your turn and have the go-to combo, it means you get an extra Xyz summon (just use the 2 PSY monsters to make Borreload Savage Dragon instead of your 2 Lv.4 dinos) for another Dolkka or an Abyss Dweller or Laggia. Otherwise, it makes great fodder for Ultimate Conductor Tyranno's effect. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno (UCT)"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno (UCT)</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boss monster of your Main Deck, for a reason. Can attack all of your opponent's monsters once each, and can non-targeting send to GY any Defense-Position monsters (this can be very useful). Not to mention it gives you an interrupt by flipping all of your opponent's monsters face-down (this kills Synchro and Xyz, a screw you to Sword Soul and Virtual World).&nbsp; Never underestimate how bad a full field of facedown cards can be for your opponent if they are not running Link cards. &nbsp;The cost of it's ability also provides many opportunities. If you have Petiteranodon in your hand you can use it for cost and special summon Dinowrestler Pankratops, giving you an extra destroy. If you have either Baby or Petit in hand or on field plus a Lost World on the field, you can also summon a token to the opponent's field during their turn and gain the benefits of Lost World (and possibly Token Collector). &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a></strong> Free special summon when going second, quick effect tributes itself for cost to destroy 1 card on your opponent's field (from GY so avoids Skill Drain), and can be special summoned during your opponent's turn by destroying a Petiteranodon in hand or on field with UCT's effect. Pretty good ""mini-boss."" &nbsp; <a data-name=""&lt;span style=""><strong>Evolzar Dolkka&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For such a good card it's surprisingly easy to summon, making it your go to negate card. Gives you 2 monster effect negate-and-destroys that can be used on the same turn. General tip is to try to maximize the impact of its ability to destroy cards by using other negates or handtraps when applicable (e.g. use Called By on your opponent's Ash or Effect Veiler rather than Dolkka b/c its destruction ability would be wasted on them). &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This card can singlehandedly shut down or cripple a large number of decks (Eldlich, Phantom Knights, Tenyi-Sword Soul, etc) but can also be completely useless against many others. Therefore, I don't usually recommend it when going first unless you can somehow get an extra Xyz summon after Dolkka. Going second or on Turn 3 it works great because you know if it will affect your opponent's deck or not.&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Usually only brought out via the Scrap engine, giving it 2 Borrel Counters. Try to save it's negate for Spell/Trap effects as Dolkka only negates monster effects. People are unreasonably afraid of this monster and will often waste their kaiju or Effect Veiler on it rather than Dolkka, DPE, or UCT, which is good for you. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone in Master Duel knows what this card does by this point. HOWEVER, it works especially well in this deck because of its ability to destroy cards on your field as well. DPE works so well with lost world and Baby/Petit, being able to trigger Lost World by targeting the Token to destroy Petit in deck giving you Pankertops, or by destroying Baby/Petit, summoning a dino, and triggering Lost World's effect to summon a Token (giving you the benefits of Lost World). Plus it is very easy to summon via Verte Anaconda in this deck. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You don't need this card in hand for this deck to be powerful, but it adds so much combo versatility and protection when you do. Always make sure to activate Lost World before normal summoning a dino so you get the token. Soulwating Oviraptor, Token Collector, Scrap Wyvern, DPE, and Dinowrestler Pankertops can all activate Lost World's second effect by targeting the Token on your opponent's field, giving you a free dino (by destroying Baby or Petit in deck). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When there is a token on the field and Lost World is active, your opponent cannot target any monster on the field other than Tokens with effects. This can be a great layer of extra protection for your board, and can also hurt your opponent (e.g. Virtual World won't be able to target their monsters to special summon, only their spells and traps) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main Combo Routes Based on Cards in Hand</strong></p><ul><li>Note for nitpickers: <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig replaces any Lv. 6 or lower Dino and </a><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> is your 4th <a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> and <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> or <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus (Main Go-To Combo)</a></strong> (if possible) Activate <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a> &gt; Summon <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor,"">Souleating Oviraptor,</a> activate effect &gt; Search <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> (or Misc.

While Charmers are considered a more casual archetype, this particular idea (born of a friend's deck building recommendation) seeks to be one of many experimental decks I wanted to do for the archetype on a long road to finding its eventual niche when coexisting with meta decks. It is not meant to be truly meta-defining, but more to pave the road to finding a definitive deck for the archetype to one day see rogue potential. It combines the surprisingly good synergy of two archetypes one would never think to use together in a deck, and is arguably one of the beefiest Charmer Decks in sheer card total.  &nbsp;  <strong>Why are Charmers the Main Focus Specifically for this Deck?</strong>  As a Yu-Gi-Oh! player who has tried to run Charmers since their debut in <em>The Lost Milennium</em>, I've become a bit of a main of the archetype. And as more support has come out for it over the years, I've commited to what many will deem a foolish endeavour. But I am a firm believer that any archetype can have a decent chance at being great with the right cards to balance out their glaring downsides. (As long as it wasn't intentionally designed to be awful, obviously)  &nbsp;  <strong>Why Use Virtual World in this Deck?</strong>  One of the biggest problems with Charmers (from mine and many other people's experience) is that Charmers on its own is quite noticeably, painfully slow. Virtual World as a secondary archetype engine not only drastically speeds up Charmers with Virtual World's swarming potential, it also provides Virtual World's annoying amounts of recursion to maximize the usefulness of Unpossessed, Shenshen's removal and self-revival effects, and access to a lot of powerful Extra Deck cards that can win Charmers a game against more viable decks every once in a while. From personal testing, Virtual World surprisingly gets along really well with Charmers due to their Main Deck monsters more commonly being in the Lv3-5 ranges.  &nbsp;  <strong>Key Cards and Tips for Using Them in the Deck</strong>  This deck has a variety of cards that do a variety of things, however these ones are deemed the most important for setup purposes: <ul>  	<li><em>The ""Channeler"" retrains of Aussa and Wynn. They not only get Virtual World monsters into the GY faster to recur them later (giving the entire deck a proper flow to its synergy), but you can also search for Lili, Lulu or Nyannyan if they have not shown up in your hand yet.</em></li>  	<li><em>Unpossessed. This is a given for Charmers to do their part in the strategy. The ""Channeler"" retrains also have the same battle protection benefits as the six base form Charmers. Due to Virtual World's swarming capabilities, it is very likely you will be able to swarm your front row with ""Charmer"" monsters very quickly off just a single copy</em></li>  	<li><em>Fairy Tail - Luna. The quintessential bounce effect card in the deck, Fairy Tail - Luna is one of the essential cards the Charmer archetype is known to rely on.</em></li>  	<li><em>Secret Village of the Spellcasters and Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters. Because of your newfound ability to constantly swarm Charmers with help from the Virtual World engine, Secret Village and Secret Sanctuary become extremely annoying cards for your opponent to deal with. The only real catch is to not get caught with your pants down in regards to your Spellcaster total.</em></li>  	<li><em>Stumbling. While this might seem like a bad idea at a glance, this keeps the base form Charmers alive for a very annoying combo with Unpossessed.</em></li>  	<li><em>Virtual World City - Kauwloon, Virtual World Gate - Qinglong, Virtual World Gate - Chuche, and Virtual World Gate - Xuanwu. These cards are pretty much essential for any deck involving Virtual World, as it is the main way the Virtual World Monsters in the deck list can swarm the board.</em></li>  	<li><em>Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen. Shenshen serves as an excellent way to get rid of problem cards from the game while it is on the board. It can also recur itself and set up other Virtual World swarming plays.</em></li>  	<li><em>Awakening of the Possessed and Dark Doriado. Both of these cards play nice with both your Virtual World and Charmer Cards. Both archetypes get stat boosts from these cards when used for backrow, and it grants card effect protection to both your Main Deck Charmers and their Link Monster retrains.</em></li>  	<li><em>Spirit Charmers, Stardust Charge Warrior, Magical Abductor, and Coral Dragon. These cards serve as even more ways to speed up the deck's pace. Spirit Charmers can exchange a brick draw card or Virtual World Monsters for either more setup or 1 backrow and 1 Charmer monster from your deck.</em></li>  	<li><em>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, and Ultimaya Tzolkin. CWSD can deal with problem cards and gain their ATK until the end phase. And while you can bring it out without issue due to Virtual World and Charmers playing nice in their synergy, Ultimaya Tzolkin can alternatively cheat it out without the materials.</em></li>  	<li><em>Cloudcastle, Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, and Vermillion Dragon Mech. Your biggest possible Synchro plays from the Virtual World Engine. Especially in Master Duel, this will be necessary for the Very Fun Dragon.</em></li>  	<li><em>Abyss Dweller and True King of All Calamities. Depending on the legality of the cards where you use this deck, you want to use either Abyss Dweller or True King of All Calamities. The Very Fun Dragon is obviously the most ideal card of the two, albeit with the caviat that Charmers can only use its power in Master Duel at the moment. Abyss Dweller - while legal in the physical game - still has its uses, though, provided you're contempt with what the Virtual World Engine has set up for Charmers in advance due to its Necrovalley-like effect.</em></li>  	<li><em>Literally every card in the Side Deck. Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring requires little to no explanation given the current meta and pace of duels. Triple Nibiru is helpful against any and all much faster decks using the Virtual World archetype as an engine or primary archetype. (Just be wary of potentially bricking with it) Gameciel can get rid of extremely problematic monsters for the deck and is the universal Kaiju to easily beat over once a problem monster is gone. (Or if you're feeling <strong>really</strong> cheeky, have Eria steal it back after its special summon) Effect Veiler is a flat-out negate for the turn in the form of a handtrap. Called By the Grave can deal with any singular hand trap.</em></li>  	<li><em>Evenly Matched. There are a <strong>LOT</strong> of risks with this card depending on the opponent when playing it in Charmers in general, but thanks to the Virtual World engine a well-thought out Evenly Matched set or hand activation can completely devastate your opponent. (Though to be fair, the same can be said for Evenly Matched in any deck that uses it wisely)</em></li>  	<li><em>Powerful Staples. A well-timed Solemn Judgement can win you the duel, Harpie's Feather Duster is an incredibly powerful form of backrow removal, and Forbidden Droplet is a very powerful non-targetting negation to as much of your opponent's board as possible that cannot be responded to by card effects. While not in the Main Deck or Side Deck, you should at least consider owning copies for your collection in case situations come up where these cards can make a difference.</em></li> </ul> <strong>Cards to Keep Your Eyes Out For, Depending on Which Modern Format of Yu-Gi-Oh! You Play</strong>  There are a couple of key factors to deckbuilding that will likely need to be gone into. There are two above especially notable cards for the base strategy, however you will only be able to use one of them in Master Duel for the full effect of this deck's synergy; when in Master Duel (When Dharc's Link retrain releases), you want to swap out <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Abyss%20Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=True%20King%20of%20All%20Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>. When looking to the future of both the TCG and Master Duel, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aussa%20the%20Earth%20Channeler"">Aussa the Earth Channeler</a> will become essential as the final addition to the Main Deck deck at two copies to make an exact total of 60 cards. When <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dharc%20the%20Dark%20Charmer%2C%20Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> comes to Master Duel, he is a must-forge for the MD version of this deck.  &nbsp;  <strong>The Deck</strong>  Monster: 2x Aussa the Earth Charmer 2x Dharc the Dark Charmer 2x Eria the Water Charmer 2x Hiita the Fire Charmer 2x Lyna the Light Charmer 2x Wynn the Wind Charmer 2x Aussa the Earth Channeler [When It Releases for TCG/MD] 2x Wynn the Wind Channeler 3x Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan 1x Virtual World Kirin - Lili 3x Virtual World Mai-Hime - Lulu 2x Virtual World Roshi - Laolao 2x Virtual World Xiezhi - Jiji 2x Fairy Tail - Luna 2x Dark Doriado 2x Magical Abductor  Spell: 3x Awakening of the Possessed 3x Spirit Charmers 3x Virtual World City - Kauwloon 2x Virtual World Gate - Qinglong 2x Secret Village of the Spellcasters 2x Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters 2x Stumbling  Trap: 3x Unpossessed 2x Virtual World Gate - Chuche 1x Virtual World Gate - Xuanwu 2x Evenly Matched 2x Infinite Impermanence  Extra: 1x Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable 1x Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy 1x Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle 1x Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze 1x Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustrous 1x Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant 1x Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen 1x Cloudcastle 1x Coral Dragon 1x Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon 1x Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys 1x Stardust Charge Warrior 1x Ultimaya Tzolkin 1x Vermillion Dragon Mech 1x Abyss Dweller  Side: 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring 2x Effect Veiler 3x Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju 3x Nibiru, the Primal Being 1x Called by the Grave 3x Crossout Designator  Other Card(s) to Consider: <ul>  	<li>True King of All Calamities (Master Duel only as of right now)</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplet</li>  	<li>Harpie's Feather Duster</li>  	<li>Solemn Judgement</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>In Conclusion, How Powerful is the Deck? And Should I give it a try?</strong>  After personal experience with it, this deck will still struggle a lot in current Yugioh purely because it's a Charmer Deck. (One archetype of note the deck has trouble beating especially being Altergeists) However, access to an extremely powerful second swarming engine gives Charmers as an archetype a significantly more likely chance of doing their thing against successfully some of the genuine meta deck archetypes. It definitely teeter-totters the fine line between casual and rogue with the current selection of cards in this deck for both Charmers and Virtual World. The potential is here, but might be easily dismissed due to the main archetype of focus and its infamy when compared to Virtual World as Charmers' companion engine. It is not a bad Charmer strategy by any means, especially due to the unexpected synergy with Virtual World. It's well worth messing around with if you're looking for a much more hectic and aggressive control variant of Charmers, or a much more...<em><strong>daring</strong></em> use of the Virtual World archetype. Though there's definitely room for more cards to be found that make this deck even better."

Deck isn't fully finished so feel free to play your own variant of it.  Optimal play is 3-card combo: Diviner of the Herald + Emergency Teleport + LM ritual (preferably lvl 3 or 6). Normal summon Diviner and send Arc Light to the GY and Search Benten. After that play E-Telly to SS Geek Boy who searches field spell. Field spell to LM Fire than search Doombroker (or Firestarter). Ritual summon using Benten from the hand and set a LM Intervention, also Benten searches Vanity's Ruler. After that ritual summon other Libromancer ritual monster using Diviner who ss Angel o1. Angel o1 gives you extra tribute summon which you use to put Vanity's on field using it and Geek Boy. Then you can link summon Linguriboh using Fire for extra protection from Imperm. And that's pretty much it.Deck is build around it so you have other tech cards like 3of Preparation of Rites. You can even play 2-card combo but then depends what other cards you have in hand.  Going second is best to disrupt opponent as much as you can and then go for LM Fireburst via LM Bonded.  P.S. I hope we will get LM lvl5 ritual"

Thunder Therions! the idea of this deck is very simple. create an end board that provides the strongest wall in the simplest way possible. the origional idea was to combine the thunder dragon archetype with the plant engine, which consists of 3 Lonefire Blossom, 3 Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio, and 2 Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra. this would provide an engine that would be able to search out Ready fusion in which you would be able to get easy access too thunder dragon titan as well as extend into a board of a 3-4 negate apollousa, as well as a quick effect pop on titan.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">but then I got to thinking, what if I included the therion engine into the deck as a way to build a much more solid board? I was already using the plant engine as a main part of the deck as its main playstarter, so it would make sense that using the therion cards would increase the power of my board state. it took me a while to figure out the ratios for this engine, but thanks to the video from Revscards predaplant list, I was able to find the perfect ratios to use in the deck. now, thanks to lonefire blossom. the deck can now extend even further into a board that consists of 4 monster negates(apollousa) + 1 quick effect pop(titan) + 1 omni negate(regulus). this is the best possible board to my knowledge that this deck can perform. I decided to run regulus, Borea, and Discolossium all at 1 because you generally do not want to draw them as you want to summon Borea off of lonefire blossom or search it with Rose belle of revelation.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Overall, I am very proud of this list, not only do I feel like I accomplished something I never thought was possible, I started to genuinely smile after I finished building this deck. thunder dragons have always had a special place in my heart as it was the first deck I ever took to locals, and seeing that colossus had gotten banned really broke me. I've spent years trying to give the deck some legs to stand on, but I've never really succeeded at that until now. I really hope ya'll like this list, and I would appreciate it if you gave me some constructive criticism on how to improve on this deck.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">P.S. the extra deck is extremely flexible as you only need about 5 slots in the extra deck to function, so the rest of the extra deck is for you to decide what to fill it with.</p>"

Both of them solve this issue by allowing for better access to Flip Monsters, even if you don't immediately have any in rotation. However, the new support also has brought along a new problem. The Deck is now extremely reliant on <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> and without any in-archetype searchers, it can be hard to access their new plays.</span>  <span>We play 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> as it enables all of your interaction on your opponent's turn. If you don't know what it does, it Specials a Flip Monster from hand or GY during the End Phase and you can Flip a monster face-up or face-down during either player's turn. 1 <strong>Nether Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>. This card is the first Flip Ritual Monster and its Flip Effect Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and it can Flip any number of monsters you control face-up or face-down. We only play 1 because it is a soft-brick in the Deck that should only be searched off of <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>. You NEED Tarotrei to Flip this card up during your opponent's turn. It does almost nothing on its own. 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. This can Summon itself face-down when it is Tributed and its Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess Monster and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand. It also has an on-field effect to prevent your Rituals from being targeted or destroyed. This was the best card to come out of the new support. It is good Ritual fodder as it can just Summon itself back and it can even search 2 cards to allow you to make another Ritual immediately and it even gives insane protection to your Rituals. The Deck is heavily reliant on this card being in your hand as Ritual fodder so we must play 3. 2 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> and 2 <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong>. These are your Flip targets for <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Tarotreith</strong> and they can also help with making Rank 9's when Summoned by <strong>World Legacy's Monstrosity</strong>. 3 <strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong> and 3 <strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong>. This Deck does not have an in-archetype Normal Summon, so we can get away with playing these. <strong>Manju</strong> helps get missing Ritual cards and <strong>Spirit</strong> helps search <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> or a Flip Monster to get into rotation. 2 <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> and 2 <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> as potential disruption options and <strong>Crossout</strong> targets.</span>  <span>3 <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> and 3<strong> Nether Prediction Ritual</strong>. <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> enables <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> as it lists <strong>Tarotrei</strong> in its effect, but the biggest thing to keep in mind is that it can ONLY Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. You cannot Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> with this card. You can only Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> with <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> which can Summon a Prediction Princess from hand or GY in face-down Defense which sets up <strong>Tarotreith</strong>'s Flip Effect. It can also banish itself during the Standby Phase in order to Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. The non-Ritual Prediction Princess monsters are either bad or too restrictive with the exception of <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>, so she is your only target. But this card pairs nicely with <strong>Tarotreith</strong>'s on field effect anyways. 2 <strong>World Legacy's Monstrosity</strong>. This card puts Flips into rotation and is a 1 card Rank 9, but you don't want to see it that frequently anymore, now that there are better ways to get Flips into rotation, so we only play 2. 1 <strong>Called by the Grave</strong>. 3<strong> Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3 <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>. 2 <strong>Crossoutout Designator</strong> and 2 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. The <strong>Impcantations</strong> do not work well with the new Support as you want to use <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> as Ritual fodder to access her effects rather than tributing off 2 Impcantations, so we aren't playing any. Because of this, we need a lot of generic search Spells, especially since there aren't any in-archetype ones, and to ensure they resolve, we are playing <strong>Called by</strong> and a <strong>Crossout</strong> package.</span>  <span>You will almost never go into the Extra Deck, but we are just playing some Rank 9's and some Xyz goodstuff. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 3 <strong>Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir</strong>, 3 <strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>, 3 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>, 2 <strong>Sacred Tree Beat, Hyperyton</strong>, 1<strong> Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon</strong>, 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</strong>, and 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck we are playing 3 <strong>Lava Golem</strong> because this Deck does not really need its Normal Summon all the time and its good removal. 2 <strong>Nibiru</strong>, 1 <strong>Ghost Belle</strong>, and 1 <strong>Droll</strong> as more <strong>Crossout</strong> targets and handtrap options. 3 <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, 1 <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, and 1 <strong>Red Reboot</strong>. You really want your plays to go through and you need all the help you can get to break an established board.</span>  <span>At minimum, full combo is access to <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> + <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> in hand. You want to Ritual Summon<strong> Tarotrei</strong> using <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>. <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> will Summon herself from GY face-down. <strong>Tarotrei</strong>'s effect Flips <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> face-up. Now, you can use <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>'s Flip Effect to add <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> and <strong>Nether Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong> from Deck to hand. If you have a Level 9 Flip Monster in hand, you can use that to Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> or you can just use <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> on field. <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> will Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> face-down. Now, if you Tributed <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> for <strong>Tarotreith</strong>, <strong>Tarotrei</strong> can Summon her back during the End Phase or <strong>Tarotrei</strong> can Summon the other Level 9 Flip you Tributed from hand. During your your opponent's Standby Phase, <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> can banish itself to Summon a <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> from Deck face-down if you want.

This is the best DM competitive deck this year. Hope all players enjoy it! Click to see the combo tutorial inside! T,"The strategy here is to setup a negate board while setting up the DM/Circle/Nav combo. Best negate board is Appollousa, Norito, and Right Hand. Its not much but this is the closest thing to a pure DM combo deck. I played this deck against Strikers and Shaddoll/Invoked so far, and it is very competitive worthy. Long live DM!

In the case of this Ninja support, it is more specialized in removing the monster when the opponent monster is the face-down defense position. So I tried to increase the number of points where the Subterror is strong and to bully the opponent more colorfully.  The way the deck works is simple. Flip the opponent's monster, remove it, and turn it into my monster.  The main point of view is to make the opponent never do anything.  Put another card in Tcg because maxx-c is a prohibited card.  In the case of a rear-end player, it is recommended to insert a rear-end card using a side deck.  If you have any questions, please leave a comment anytime."

Lady of Lament gives you access to them while Labrynth gives you extra benefits when using your Traps, so they work nicely together.</span>  <span>1 <strong>Labrynth of the Silver Castle</strong>. This card prevents your opponent from responding to your Normal Trap activations with monster effects, it can re-set a Normal Trap from GY, and it can destroy a card your opponent controls or in their hand when a monster leaves the field by your Normal Trap's Effect. We only play 1 because it should realistically only be Summoned off of <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> or off of <strong>Labrynth Labyrinth</strong> if you do draw it. It cannot Summon itself, so it is a brick most of the time. 3 <strong>Labrynth Servant Arianna</strong> as this card searches a Labrynth card on Summon and it allows you to Draw 1 and then either Summon a Fiend from hand or Set 1 Spell/Trap from hand when a monster leaves the field by your Normal Trap. This is another good target for <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> as you would usually rather be using your Normal Summon for your Lady of Laments. 1 <strong>Labrynth Chandra</strong>. This card can set a Labrynth Spell/Trap directly from hand or Deck and it adds itself back when a monster leaves the field by your Normal Trap. It is also a Level 3 Fiend which pairs up nicely with your Lady of Laments. 2 <strong>Tour Guide from the Underworld</strong>. This card is basically a 1 card <strong>UDF</strong> if you don't have access to your Lady of Lament lines or Labrynth lines. 3 <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong>. This card sets Normal Traps from your Deck. 1 <strong>Loris, Lady of Lament</strong>. The only effect you are using is her effect to set a Normal Trap from GY if a monster is tributed or if your Normal Trap is sent to GY by an effect. You really only want to Summon <strong>Loris</strong> by<strong> Ties of the Brethren</strong>, so we are only playing 1. 3 <strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong>. This card can banish a Trap from hand or GY to Summon itself from hand and it can basically search another Lady of Lament when it is tributed. Finally, 1 <strong>Sangan</strong> for tribute fodder. <strong>Malice, Lady of Lament</strong>'s effect is too costly for a small benefit, so we aren't playing her.</span>  <span>3 <strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong>. This card sets up your entire Lady of Lament line. Any Level 3 DARK Fiend gives access to <strong>Lilith</strong> and another Lady of Lament or even<strong> Sangan</strong> for tribute fodder for <strong>Lilith</strong>. This gives <strong>Lilith</strong> basically 2 searches for a Trap to set as she is a Quick Effect, so you can do it once on your turn and again on your opponent's turn. 2 <strong>Labrynth Labyrinth</strong> as it allows you to Special a Fiend from hand or GY if you activate a non-Labrynth Normal Trap. Also, it gives <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> an additional pop with its effect. 1 <strong>Ghostrick Mansion</strong> as a secondary search off of <strong>Ghostrick Alucard</strong> as you are mainly searching <strong>Ghostrick Shot</strong> for an easy <strong>UDF</strong>. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, 2 <strong>Different Dimension Ground</strong>, 2 <strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>, 2 <strong>Compulsory Evacuation Device</strong>, 3<strong> Torrential Tribute</strong>, and 3 <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong>. <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> can Special a Labrynth monster from Deck and it can reset itself when a monster leaves the field by a Normal Trap effect.</span>  <span>Extra Deck is 3 <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>, 1 <strong>Fossil Warrior Skull Knight</strong>, and 1<strong> Wind Pegasus @ignister</strong> as <strong>Punishment</strong> targets and <strong>Artemate Slay</strong> targets. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</strong>. 2 <strong>Ghostrick Angel of Mischief</strong> and 2 <strong>Ghostrick Alucard</strong> for <strong>UDF</strong> set-ups. 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</strong> and 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future</strong>. 1 <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, 1<strong> Knightmare Phoenix</strong>, and 1 <strong>Dharc the Dark Charmer, Umbral</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck isn't that special. 3 <strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong>, 3 <strong>Raigeki</strong>, and 3 <strong>Artemate Slay</strong>. If you are going second, you want as much removal as possible as this isn't the usual set 5 pass Deck. 2 <strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong>, 2 <strong>Archfiend Glitch</strong>, and 2 <strong>Sundered from Overroot</strong>. <strong>Sundered from Overroot</strong> is interesting as it is non-destruction removal which can also stop your opponent's plays</span>"

There is nothing more to improve. This deck has no straight combo. You also wanna get into your Crimson Resonator and use Level 4 Monsters to make red rising and bring back Crimson to activate it's effect to special summon up to 2 Resonators from your deck (or hand). If you have the ascator engine plus Crimson Resonator, you can special summon Crimson Resonator and then activate Ascator the Dawnwalker, discard one (Jet Synchron, Destrudo, Dangers, Red Familiar, Stygian Streetpatrol etc) and special summon itself plus Fire Ant Ascator from your deck (or hand) make Chaos Ruler and activate it's effect and then you can use Crimson Resonators second effect.  You can use Synkronresonators second effect multiple times per turn to bounce back resonators and discard them with the dangers to extend furthermore. You can also use Creation Resonator and Synkron Resonator to synchro summon, so you can add back Creation Resonator to special summon it again.  The goal of this deck is to get into Crimson Resonator as fast as possible, summon Chaos Ruler and use Red Rising Dragon multiple times. Also using Synkronresonator multiple times. Then you make boards like one or two Red Supernova Dragon and/or one or more Hot Red Abyss with Void Ogre Dragon.  It really depends on your opening hand, what you drawn into, what you will mill with Chaos Ruler and which resonator you special summon."

But they're such gas not sure why you would. Plays surprisingly well under a board but obv prefers to go first; a truly lucky hand can net you 3-4 negates and a starter can get you at least 2. I like drones because you can consistently make baronne and hotred if you see it; little extra but allows you to make amazing dragon or punisher over the HRDAKC if you need that kind of thing instead. Honestly, plays through hand traps decently.  Has great matchups in general; not a lot can play through the boards it spits out. Side deck is for going second almost exclusively.  Kagari also a little extra clutch being a machine typing for Regulus; had that come up a couple times and felt guuuud."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

Pilots are the ones that &ldquo;tag out&rdquo; - banish themselves - to special summon a higher level Kozmo monster from hand. These are mostly distinctive by the fact they are all psychics, and typically low level (ignoring Dark Lady.) Ships are much more self explanatory - Special summon them, then if they get destroyed you can special summon a pilot. Ships range from level 5 to 10.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are different ways to play Kozmo. Pure kozmo tends to focus on control/stun, while hybrids can combo off. For the ratio list, I will mark the typical ratios of Kozmo cards, though it&rsquo;s entirely down to the build you&rsquo;re trying to, pun intended, pilot.</p><p>𝙎𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙤𝙩𝙨</p><p>Tincan - The wincan. Can't beat the normal tincan set 2 pass. Gets you the pilots, and can tag out whenever.&nbsp;</p><p>Strawman - Excellent at looping destroyed ships, especially in Fire King variants.&nbsp;</p><p>Soartroopers - Brings back pilots in the grave, which is great if you're running a variant with a heavy extra deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Farmgirl - Our girl who can otk and get us a destroyer in the battle phase. Can be hard to deal battle damage with a 1k monster.</p><p>Goodwitch - Book of moon effect which can lock your opponent out of certain plays.&nbsp;</p><p>Wickedwitch - A fun stall card to get you through a turn with a decent attack stat.&nbsp;</p><p>Darklady - Monster negate quick effect, and can still tag out.</p><p>𝙎𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨</p><p>Sliprider - Pop effect for spells doesn't seem much, but popping town or Fire King Island can be a godsend for combos.</p><p>DOG Fighter - If you're playing a slower game it may be good for token generation, but in combos it can be difficult to pull off the token effect. Might be better to cut and run other ships.</p><p>Forerunner - No target, LP gain, beefy attack. Excellent to float into from destroyer.</p><p>Dark Destroyer - Our big boss. Free pop, with the same protection as forerunner.&nbsp;</p><p>Dark Eclipser - Trap negate, and is often one of the ships picked off tincan to add to the hand. It can't float, but still useful for the adding card.</p><p>𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙨</p><p>Kozmotown - One of the best field spells in the game. Hand fixing, adding back banished pilots and ships, and getting a free ship on destruction.</p><p>𝙎𝙪𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩, 𝙑𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙨</p><p>Emergency teleport: absolute staple in any build. Free pilot at no cost, since you can tincan before E-Tele resolves.</p><p>Storm Dragon&rsquo;s return: gives you back a ship or pilot!</p><p>Swords Of Revealing Light: gives you time to xyz summon or to get your field together.</p><p>𝙆𝙤𝙯𝙢𝙤 𝙆𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙤𝙝</p><p>Use astral Kuriboh to summon from your extra deck, All monsters levels in your extra deck match the monsters in your main deck needed to special summon use each one wisely.</p><p>Number 61 - Cannot be sent to the grave yard when attacked</p><p>There is also 2 main heavy xyz summon variants for this deck i like to use</p><p><strong>Level 7</strong></p><p>If you have a 2 level 7 monsters or astral kuriboh you can summon Number 42 and use his effect depending on the game you can win with this by summoning as many 2k monsters on the field as you can.

I tested 25 random start hands with the ygoprodeck Deck Builder (Edit -&gt; shuffle OR Tools -&gt; Simulate Start-Hand) and got 20 times the goal reached, thanks to the draw cards (use Edit -&gt; shuffle to confirm drawing cards) so in my calc the deck has an efficient rate of <strong>80%</strong> if going first. here some turn 1 start hands (one Hand each row): <img src=""https://imageshack.com/i/pmhWem4Sp"" alt=""some Turn One Start Hands"" width=""574"" height=""636"" />  for the plays after turn one, i put in <a data-name=""Needle Worm"">Needle Worm</a> and <a data-name=""Morphing Jar"">Morphing Jar</a>, so second Goal is to mill the opponents Deck, but u can also play something else here  &nbsp;  * keep it simple, stupid!  &nbsp;"

As I'm sure we all know <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> is a one card Borreload Savage thanks to <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a>, while <a data-name=""Black Dragon Collapserpent"">Black Dragon Collapserpent</a> and <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a> are your usual extenders to get to Verte Anaconda, you can also get to these 2 via <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a> and <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space. </a></span></span><span><span><span><span>Note that if Verte can manage to survive the opponent's turn you already have a link 2 monster to use for <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> or <a data-name=""Borrelsword Drago"">Borrelsword Drago</a>n to finish the game off.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The optimal endboard:<span> <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</a> + </span></span><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> + <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fang With Chain"">Red-Eyes Fang With Chain</a>. As you can see, this endboard includes the usual one plus Spheres being able to bounce a card back to hand and Fang with Chain for stealing a monster and an extra equip card that Slash Dragon can use for it's effect. You can end with both Spheres and Verte if your hand is loaded with extenders like <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> or if you summon <a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a> off of <a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a> or Tracer's effect when already having access to <a data-name=""Rokket Recharger"">Rokket Recharger</a>, in addition to the chaos dragons.

So, I wanna","I quite enjoy playing pure Melffy. This is the list I feel comfortable playing right before they get new support from Power of the Elements, which will help them a lot giving more disruptions. So, I wanna save this list I have nowadays to compare it with what I can come up with in the future. First of all, I consider it a control deck. Trying to generate advantage every turn, and disrupting the opponent on key points. And since I take it as a control deck, I believe Torrential Tribute is a really powerful card that fits really well into Melffy's strategy for three reasons: 1- Before the deck snowballs advantage, we end up having the field with just a few (or none) monsters, since they all come back to the hand, so wiping the field is not bad. 2- Even with we committed a lot to the field, 95% of our end boards consist of Beast-type monsters, which can get once-per-turn protection from destruction from Mellfy Hide-and-seek. 3- Psy-frame Gear Gamma is amazing in this deck, so if you activated it, you could wipe the field to make Driver go to the GY, and still have it available later.  The deck has 9 starters: 3x Obedience Schooled, 3x Rescue Cat and 3x Nimble Beaver. Kalantosa is the main form of disruption, by destroying cards."

But the January 2022 banlist, killed the deck by removing Simorgh (press F) and 2 copies of Recital Starling (also F, since the reverse OTK with double Starling + Nightingale was the deck's best win condition.) Losing her reduces so much the deck's consistency that I don't think it can be played going first anymore. So this is the version I came up with to go second. And a side deck for when you believe the opponent will make you go first. Alpha + Warbler is a nice synergy to start baiting negations, and he is also a way to put Recital Staring back in the extra deck (just keep in mind that targeting her to go back to the extra deck doesn't add up to the total of monsters from your opponent's field you can bounce back.). Wynn is really nice to give one more search to the deck if needed. Since Wynn + cobalt or wagtail is a nice way to extend by searching Warbler or Beryl canary. Elfobia is kinda cool when going first, with Emergency Teleport back at three we can summon her, lock the opponent with any bird in hand, and link her in the Harpie Conductor. Harpie's feather storm is still legal, so there's no reason not to use it here."

Going first, the aim is to resolve Branded Fusion; having a gamma in hand is always really great because branded fusion is an ash magnet. Normal Summon Aluber to get a copy of Branded Fusion, activate Branded Fusion, Send Shaddoll Beast and Albaz to summon Lubellion, use Lubellion's effect to summon Mirrorjade, and get a free draw off Beast. Use Mirrorjade's effect to send Apkallone to the GY and banish the Aluber. Activate Apkallone's effect in the GY to get a copy to Schism to your hand. Set Schism and pass. On the opponent's draw phase, flip Schism, and banish Apkallone and Beast to summon Winda. Now your opponent is Winda locked and you still have 3 cards in hand, which could be hand traps or follow up plays. If the opponent manages to negate Winda's effect and still summon a full board and gets rid of Mirrorjade, on the end phase, all your opponent's monsters will be destroyed, leaving you a clear field to OTK, which is what cyber dragons do best.  Going second, assuming you have a Cyber Dragon core, that is a possible OTK. Normal summon Core to get Realm to your hand. Activate Realm to get a copy of Chimera and then normal summon Chimera using Realm's effect. Use Chimera's effect to pitch a spell/trap to get a copy of Power Bond. Link Core and Chimera into Sieger. Activate Power Bond, using Sieger on the field and banishing Core in the grave, which is made possible due to Chimera's effect, to summon Rampage with 4200 atk and the ability to pop two back row as well as attack thrice.  There is a small Dogmatika package in the deck as well which is really useful in certain situations. You can use Nadir Servant at the end of a turn to send Albion to search Branded Fusion for your next turn, or N'tss to pop a card, or even Omega to recycle cards from the GY. You can even use Mirrorjade's effect to send Titaniklad to search Ecclesia late game to secure an advantage. Ecclesia, which searches Fleur, is quite useful to keep in your hand and then slap down to negate an extra deck monster with the effect of Fleur.

Trouble Sunny's graveyard effect works similar to the Golden Lord Eldlich as it can send a card on the field to the graveyard, and this is non-destruction so it can bypass monsters that can't be targeted or destroyed by battle.  The interchangeable cards are Lightning Storm and Live Time Home. I would replace these with stun cards or backrow removal."

This means optional ""when"" trigger effects cannot activate if they would trigger upon being sent. Not really a ruling that comes up in modern Yu-Gi-Oh but it does mean that everything I said the deck can do can in fact not be done. So yeah, Neo-Spacians, not that great. Who would've thought (technically it's Cross Porter who's subpar, still carry much love for my space buds!)</span>  <span>Anywhoskidaddle, you're not here to talk about Neo-Spacians. You're here for <span>Dark World x Drill Warrior</span>.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Dark World</span>  <span>Most Dark World monsters function similarly. If they're <strong>discarded</strong> to the <strong>GY</strong> by a <strong>card effect</strong> (keywords matter) they trigger their effect and if they were discarded by an opponent's card effect instead they will - when resolving said effect - perform something on top of it. Most of the time you'll be the one discarding your cards tho.</span>  <span>Exception to the rule is <span><a data-name=""Brron, Mad King of Dark World"">Brron, Mad King of Dark World</a></span>. Brron discards a card when inflicting battle damage. It's a way to trigger your other cards effects. He's nothing too special but nothing to scoff at with 1800 ATK.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World"">Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Sillva, Warlord of Dark World"">Sillva, Warlord of Dark World</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World"">Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World</a></span> all Special Summon themselves when discarded.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Broww, Huntsman of Dark World"">Broww, Huntsman of Dark World</a></span> draws a card.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Gren, Tactician of Dark World"">Gren, Tactician of Dark World</a> </span>destroys spell/traps</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Kahkki, Guerilla of Dark World"">Kahkki, Guerilla of Dark World</a></span> destroys monsters.</span>  <span>Their Spells and Traps facilitate that strategy. <span>Dark World Dealings</span> draws both you and your opponent a card and then makes you both discard. <span>Dark World Lightning</span> destroys a set card (that's both backrow and monsters) and then makes you discard one.</span>  <span>So they have removal, swarming capabilities but sadly need very specific hands to do all that and as you might've realised, discarding cards doesn't really win you the grind game.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Drill Warrior</span>  <span>Here's where it gets interesting.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Volcanic Shell"">Volcanic Shell</a></span> keeps cards in hand for discards and most importantly allows for Drill Warrior plays.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Quickdraw Synchron""><span>Quickdraw Synchron</span></a> allows for a few, very strong Synchro plays. Keep in mind that Quickdraw doesn't trigger your Dark World monsters. With Shell you can summon Drill Warrior.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Drill Warrior"">Drill Warrior</a> </span>has two effects. With the latter it discards a card (when resolving the effect, triggering your Dark World cards) and banish itself. During your next SP it returns to your field and adds you a monster from your GY to your hand. This gives you incredible recursion.</span>  <span>You can 1) keep adding back Sillva and Goldd to summon them again every turn, b) add back Gren or Kahkki to destroy a spell/trap or monster every. single. turn. or c) add back Quickdraw Synchron to summon another Drill Warrior since each copy can use their effects once per turn, allowing you to double down on a) and b).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Generic Cards</span>  <span>I won't go over every single Edison staple but <span><a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a></span> can search any part of the Drill Warrior engine, <span><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a></span> allows for more Synchro plays and your playing a DARK deck with good control over your GY so <span><a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a></span>'s in here, too.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Honorary Mentions</span>  <span><a data-name=""Dark Deal"">Dark Deal</a></span> <span>is a Dark World card (although not by name) that forces your opponent to make you discard. This is considered to be discarded by your opponent's card effect and triggers the additional effect of your Dark World monsters. But the discard is random so it's a little too hit or miss for me.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Gateway to the Dark World"">Gateway to the Dark World</a></span> is also seeing play in some decks. But summoning a 2300 ATK body tops on your opponents turn that requires a little setup is just not worth the investment imo.</span>  <span>Once Shell is in rotation it's stay in rotation and with Dealings and Allure you have quite the drawing power. However if you want even more consistency for Quickdraw you can play <span><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></span> to search it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Rulings</span>  <span>Dark World Lightning has to destroy a set card. If the card is flipped face-up (a monster by card effect or the targetted backrow is chained for example) Lightning will not destroy the card and therefore not discard.</span>  <span>When Drill Warrior mandatorily Special Summons itself it then adds a monster afterwards, meaning your opponent cannot use Torrential Tribute here. Also if there's no free monster zone it will be sent to the GY.</span>  <span>The Dark World cards all have mandatory trigger effects (they are lacking the word ""can""), meaning they HAVE to resolve and cannot miss timing. </span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span>Well, there you have it. Have fun and get your game on.</span>"

Majestic Mechs, along with their boss monsters Pyrotech Mech - Shiryu and Malevolent Mech - Goku En, all send themselves to the Graveyard during the End Phase of the turn they are summoned. This deck attempts to circumvent this by playing cards such as Axe of Fools and Tethys, Goddess of Light to negate the Majestic Mech effects, keeping them on the field. It also runs D.D. Sprite as a way to cheat out some of the tribute dependent Majestic Mech monsters while also serving as a level 1 Tuner that can go into powerful synchro cards like Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier, Stardust Dragon, Black Rose Dragon, Colossal Fighter, and more. It also runs a small Rank 4 XYZs package."

And as a proud muscle fetishi--*Ahem*...wheyfu enthusiast, I've always liked this archetype. Also, I saw Tania in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, and them biceps...Dayum!"

At 60 years old, he was taken from us too soon, and the Yu-Gi-Oh community did not deserve this tragedy. My Takahashi-themed decks will be of archetypes who were either revealed during the era they were based on, or whose key cards were revealed during that era.  &nbsp;  This is my GX-themed deck: Lost World Dinos. Babycerasaurus was a card used by Tyranno Hassleberry, one of my favorite characters from Yu-Gi-Oh GX. Ultimate Conductor Tyranno is basically a fusion of all of his ""Tyranno"" monsters, and Lost World is more or less a retrain of Jurassic World, which he used. Gameplay wise, this deck can go first or second, but I prefer to go second. It also has a Super Poly and Doodle Beast engine in the side deck.  &nbsp;  As for the name of this deck, ""Takahashodon"", it essentially translates to ""Takahashi's Tooth"" or ""Takahashi's Teeth"", as if it were referring to a prehistoric animal. It comes from the Greek root word ""odon"", which means ""tooth/teeth."" A lot of extinct animals have names with this root: <em>Dimetrodon, Iguanodon, Heterodontosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, Smilodon, Megalodon, Liopleurodon, Dimorphodon</em>, and so on."

I didn't have many options for 5Ds-era archetypes to choose, either because those archetypes are terrible, or they are too complicated for me to play. So I went with Nordics, which are admittedly still very lacking as an archetype. The reason for the name is obvious. Because of the Adventurer Token engine and Nordics' whole ""defend the castle"" playstyle, you wanna go first at all times."

For the most part, I send Clockwork Night to the graveyard (either with Revolving Switchyard or Goods) to get more search power. Also, combo'd with some other cards, you can search Flying Pegasus Railway Stampede and get a total of 3 Level 10 Machines on the field, for 2 Rank 10 Xyz monsters.  &nbsp;  Even with the extra searching and summoning power that Clockwork Night and FBG provide, you want to go second.

These two new group of cards alone shakes up the meta game to a considerable amount, seeing as the Adventure engine is splashable in everything and is good going 1st and 2nd, while the Floowandereeze deck allows you to win going 1st by setting up an impressive board that wins you the game unless they have dark ruler/droplet. This deck is in my opinion one of the best ways to abuse this engine outside of a few exceptions. Now without further ado, lets dive right in.  &nbsp;  The deck is similar to a list that was very successful not to long ago in the TCG, utilizing level 3s to make Cherubini and set up your adventure plays alongside Halqifibrax to make your end board of <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light, </a><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur, Phoenix Enforcer, and a set scythe to completely blow your opponent out of the water! You can also go second with this deck exceptionally well due to the amount of extenders you play as well as the utility cards you can run, which we can get into later. All in all, this deck has very strong combos that combat the format pretty well.</a>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The main combo:  Sangan + level 3 extender:  normal summon Sangan  special summon level 3 extender  make Cherubini  trigger Sangan to add Arboria  Cherubini to send Water Enchantress  Water Enchantress to search Rite of Aramaseir  Rite to special summon a token and place Fateful Adventure  special summon Arboria  summon Halq using the Cherubini and Arboria  Halq as chain link 1 and Fateful as chain link 2 to prevent your Halqifibrax from getting ashed, which means you'll be grabbing a Dracoback with Fateful and you'll be summoning Red Rose Dragon off of Halq  Fateful effect to search for Gryphon Rider and pitch the Dracoback, which you can (and should) trigger to reequip itself to the token  special summon Gryphon Rider since you control the Adventure Token  synchro off Gryphon Rider and Red Rose to make Baronne de Fleur, triggering Red Rose to summon Roxrose from deck, which will add you Basal Rose Shoot.  synchro the Adventure Token and Roxrose into a Yazi  use Baronne's effect to pop Yazi, which will trigger it to special summon Mare Mare from the deck.  use Mare Mare's effect once to make a Token  use the newly made Token and Halqifibrax to make Dagda  use Basal Rose Shoot to special summon a Rose Dragon from grave, then trigger Dagda to set an Artifact Scythe.  use Mare Mare one more time to make a Token  use Token and Roxrose to make a Herald of the Arc Light  use Dagda and Mare Mare to make Verte  Verte effect, sending Fusion Destiny to fusion summon Enforcer using materials from the deck (although they are banished, though that doesn't matter too much)  Pass your turn  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  With that combo, you get two omni negates (a negate for anything) through Baronne and Herald, a mini floodgate in Herald of the Arc Light (monsters sent from deck/hand are banished instead), and a scythe lock (DPE popping the set scythe in the standby, triggering Scythe).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  That's all I will show for now, if you have any questions please let me know down below."

The deck is built around the concept of summoning Slifer as quick as possible to blow up the enemy field with ""Thunderforce Attack"" and/or ""Harpie's Feather Duster"".  While in the hand, Slifer can be normal summoned easily using many cards that create a lot of tokens, such as ""Scapeghost"" and ""Reactor Slime"", or you can Special Summon an ""Egyptian God Slime"" using Reactor Slime's effects (it represents a triple tribute for a Divine-Beast);  ""Pot of Greed"" (still banned but who cares, this deck is built merely for fun) ensures more draws, more deck speed and therefore more power for Slifer; ""Reload"" can turn a bad hand into a full combo ready to summon Slifer: the probabilities to draw Card Advance and The True Name at the same time are doubled.  Maxx ""C"" is the perfect jolly to play against an opponent that relies on Special Summons: discard Maxx ""C"" while your opponent is Special Summoning and your hand will become fully of extra cards of your deck. This not only increased the possibilieties to draw ""The True Name"" and/or ""Card Advance"" but it makes Slifer even more powerfull. The ""Yosenju Kama 1-2-3"" cards are the Slifer's recharge in ATK: they all return to the hand in End Phase, even if they are in the graveyard.  ""Soul Crossing"" is here to represent an alternative to ""Card Advance"" to summon Slifer: soul crossing give an extra normal summon exclusively for a Divine-Beast monster, it's a quick spell card (means that if it's Set, you can active it during the opponent's turn) and, finally, you can sacrifice any number of your opponent's monster for this specific summon. Soul crossing is a jolly that can easily overturn the game.  The field magic card ""Mound of the Bound Creator"" protect Slifer from being targeted or destroyed by card effects. The trap card ""Reckless Greed"" is the perfect ambush while Slifer is on the field and an opponent's monster with higher ATK attacks your Divine-Beast: this trap gives to Slifer extra 2000 ATK in a blink, possibly saving the game.  The strategy is all here: the other cards are there for general utility and you can be creative and modify it as you will. I hope you have fun with this deck (besides, this cards aren't too much expensive)."

Creating unbreakable boards with over 7+ negates.,"Here I bring you the most consistent combo deck you could ever want or wish! This deck features 60 cards of perfectly calculated cards needed to create an unbreakable 7 negate board with every hand possible. Only requiring 3 general cards for each hand to create amazing end boards with skill and fulfilled plays to make it.  Lets first discuss what do you need for an opening hand? Thanks to the new dracoslayer cards, we have a new stronger way of making combos. Your hand should consist of any 2 Igknight pendulum monsters and a <a data-name=""Ignis Phoenix, the Dracoslayer"">Ignis Phoenix, the Dracoslayer</a>, this hand along with 1 discard card creates an unbreakable board with over 7 negates. Alternatively, Your hand could also consist of any 4 Igknight pendulum monsters as 2 of them become a Ignis Phoenix. Every card in this deck will create a variation of both of these hands since we play already 24 Igknight's, + 16 cards that can search them. Including the extender cards, this deck has 46 main cards that you always wanna see in your hand making it the most consistent possible.  With those hands in mind, you should be able to pull off a board like the two below (imgur link):  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/eoevC3H"">https://imgur.com/a/eoevC3H</a>  To make this board, we perform the following combo: <ol>  	<li>Activate 1 Igknight pendulum monster and Ignis Phoenix, then activate the Igknight's effect to add a FIRE warrior-type monster; Add a Sublimation Knight if not already in hand.</li>  	<li>Trigger Ignis Phoenix effect to summon a <a data-name=""Majesty Pegasus, the Dracoslayer"">Majesty Pegasus, the Dracoslayer</a>. On it's summon you search your field spell of your choosing (whatever you have sided in) to then have whatever card in your hand discarded.</li>  	<li>Normal summon <a data-name=""Sublimation knight"">Sublimation knight</a> using its effect to equip <a data-name=""Squeaknight"">Squeaknight</a>. Use Squeaknight's effect to special summon itself. Do NOT use it's effect to turn itself into a tuner monster. Use both your Sublimation knight and Squeaknight to Link summon Isolde.</li>  	<li>Use isolde's effect to add from your deck to your hand another Igknight monster, one that has a scale opposite to the one in hand. (i.e. If you have a scale 7 in hand, search for a Igknight with a scale 2). Use Isolde's second effect to special summon Infernoble Knight Renaud from your deck by sending a living fossil, triggering Renaud's effect to hand to your hand your Living fossil from the GY. (If you already have Renaud in hand, summon Fire Flint Lady instead from your deck sending Living Fossil, then you can summon itself from it's own ability).</li>  	<li>Remembering that Majesty Pegasus is a Tuner, you use Isolde and Majesty Pegasus to Link summon Crystron Halqifibrax, which then summons a Red Rose Dragon from your deck or hand.</li>  	<li>Use Red Rose Dragon and Renaud to Synchro summon into Herald of the Arc Light, summoning into the far main zone so its not in a link zone so we can pendulum summon later. Triggering Red Rose's effect to special summon Roxrose Dragon from your hand or deck into a main zone so its not in a link zone. Triggering it's effect to add to hand Basel Rose Shoot from your deck.</li>  	<li>You can now activate both of the 2 Igknight monsters in your hand as scales. Using them to pendulum summon out of your extra deck both of your dracoslayers to the zones from Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Using both of your Dracoslayers, link summon a Artifact Dagda. Then you can use either Rose Shoot to summon Red Rose Dragon from GY or use Living fossil targetting Sublimation knight, where you can then chain Artifact Dagda to set a Artifact Scythe. Then use your other spell in hand to summon the other monster so your board is full.</li>  	<li>Using Artifact Dagda, Roxrose Dragon, Red Rose Dragon and Sublimation knight to link summon into an Apollousa. From here you would activate your Igknight pendulum effect to add to your hand Therion ""Bull"" Ain from your deck or GY.</li>  	<li>Activate Therion Bull's effect to special summon itself by targeting a warrior in your GY, where you target Squeaknight. You can then use Sqeaknight effect again to special summon itself. Here, you DO activate it's effect to make itself a Tuner. Using your Therion Bull and Squeaknight you can Synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon, equiping to it either Artifact Dagda or Isolde.</li>  	<li>Finally you would activate your field spell of choice, I prefer Therion Discollesium, which will add to my hand Therion Regulus that will special summon itself by targeting and equiping Therion Bull in my GY.</li> </ol> Weak Points: This Deck unfortunately suffers through a lot of handtraps, especially Droll and Lock bird, Nibiru and well targeted infinite impermanence. Luckily we do have some play around them, hence why we play 2 isolde's so that even if it gets effect veiler'd or infinite we can make another simply enough. Another trick to remember is that the Igknight pendulum effect to destroy the scales is an effect and not a cost. So your opponent can ashe blossum them, but it doesn't destroy your scales and they are not once per turn. That catches a few players off every now and then.  Your hands will not always be perfect and follow the guideline, but with some clever thinking you are able of pulling through to your final board everytime I guarantee it (as long as you are not interupted :P). This deck is much more weaker on the going second front in terms of playing through your opponent, hence why the side deck is just filled with going second cards, enough to destroy or use up some resource of your opponents to progress through your own combo.  Strong Points: It's fun as hell braining your way through to try and generate these boards while trying to keep in mind everything you have done so far. Versatile to playing around any certain strategy your opponent may be playing, with knightmares for removal, secret village for spell lock down, and a plethera of extra deck monsters all able to try and break down an opposing board if going second. Don't except this to go Meta due to it's glass cannon nature, but boy is it fun!  Hope you found this deck interesting a fun! Let me know if I am missing of anything that would be worth implementing and let me know your experience with this deck!"

Maximus Dragma is one of your main extra deck destruction tools, being able to be special summoned by banishing extra deck monsters from your grave, meaning you can generate bodies on the field by getting rid of dead cards that were sent by Nadir, Punishment, White Knight/Relic, Branded Central, Dogmatikalamity, this card locks you out of your extra deck for the remainder of your turn. Dogmatika Ashiyan can summon itself if a extra deck monster was sent to the GY which is an easy condition to fulfil with this deck, upon summon you can retrieve from your grave any Dogmatika card, it also has an effect that gives 500ATK/DEF boost to your Dogmatika monsters if your opponent declares an attack. Fleur De Lis the Dogmatika Knight, sharing the same special summon condition as Ecclesia, is your archetypal Eveiler she is better in comparison due to the negate effect not targeting, her other effect is similar to Ashiyan giving your Dogmatikas a 500ATK/DEF boost when you declare an attack. The Heretics: Lets start with their Lv8 ritual monster White Knight of Dogmatika, this card has the continuous effect of not allowing you to special summon from your extra deck, now for its positive effects when your opponent activates any card or effect you can send 1 monster from both players extra decks to the GY, and if you do this card gains half of their combined attack, which most of the time generates a 3k'ish White Knight, pairing it with Ashyan and Fleur you can get some big numbers. As for their Lv4 ritual monsters White Relic of Dogmatika, unlike Knight this card doesnt lock you out of your extra deck and it is mentioned in a ritual spell, which means P-Prep of Rites works with it, when summoned she can make one monster gain the ATK equal to another monster on the field, it also has a passive effect that protect your Lv8 Dogmatikas from being destroyed by battle which doesnt come up as often, the effect you are using this card for allows her to send 1 monster from your opponent's extra deck when your opponent dares to summon anything from it. Prayers and Curses: Dogmatikas have 2 ritual spells and 1 ritual trap, starting with the spells Dogmatikalamity is one of the best ritual spell cards in game by being able to use monsters from your extra deck as requirements for the summons, so for the summon of Relic you can send Elder Entity N'tss or even Herald of the Arc Light, as for White Knight cards like Psy-Framelord Omega or Titaniklad the Ash Dragon. Their second spell that is searcheable via P-Prep is Dogmatikabre which lets you summon any Dogma ritual monsters from your hand or GY, it also allows you to banish ed monsters from your grave to fulfil the requirements for the ritual summon, it also has an effect that triggers if both Knight and Relic are on the field, allowing you to look at either your or your opponent's extra deck to send 1 card from it to the grave, the main thing you will be doing with this card is banishing your ""dead"" extra deck monsters. As for their unique ritual trap Dogmatikaturgy summons any Dogmatika ritual monster from your deck or hand by tributing Dogmatika or extra deck monsters on your field. You are mostly using this card for its second effect which shuffles back from the GY into the deck 1 dogmatika monster and adds another one to your hand. The Ammo for your Dogmatikas (and Artemate Slay): <strong>Fusions:</strong> &diams; Titaniklad the Ash dragon: During the EP adds or summons one Dogmatika from your deck &diams; Elder Entity N'tss: Destroys a card when its sent to the GY (not once per turn) <strong>Synchro:</strong> &diams; PSY-Framelord Omega: Recycles itself and 1 cards in the GY being basically infinite ammo&nbsp; &diams; Wind Pegasus @Ignister: Shuffles into the deck 1 card your opponent controls if they destroy one of your cards be it via battle or card effect &diams; Herald of the Arc Light: Ritual monster/spell searcher (not once per turn) <strong>Xyz:</strong> &diams; Toadally Awesome: Self Recycling <strong>LINK:</strong> &diams; Five-Headed Link Dragon: Big body for Dogmatika Punishment &diams; Borrelcode Dragon: Banishes 1 dark monster with 3000ATK from the field to summon to your field a Topologic, in this case I chose to run Bomber Dragon &diams; Topologic Bomber Dragon: Read above &diams; Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden: A way to get one of your low level spellcasters in the GY &diams; Paleozoic Cambroraster: Protect your set cards</p>"

At 60 years old, he was taken from us too soon, and the Yu-Gi-Oh community did not deserve this tragedy. My Takahashi-themed decks will be of archetypes who were either revealed during the era they were based on, or whose key cards were revealed during that era.  &nbsp;  This is my SEVENS-era deck and my final deck for the Kazuki Takahashi series. This is a pure P.U.N.K. deck I made with their newest cards--P.U.N.K. JAM Dragon Drive and P.U.N.K. JAM Extreme Session! This deck runs 9 hand traps, so it can go second and do pretty well. It can also go first and summon Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity on their turn."

If you want to start your Evil Twin combo and use the Adventurer engine in the same turn, normal summon your Live Twin monster and then use Live Twin Home to special summon the other Live Twin monster in order to do so.  Small World is an excellent card to get your combo started or even to extend it by just banishing any handtrap you may have to grab a Twin monster or even Water Enchantress. Additionally, if you've got your girls on the board already and you have a Ki-sikil or a Lil-la in your hand, you could use Small World to banish them and Droll to bring out an Ash for your opponent's turn. That's the magical thing about this card!  I'll try to update the decklist as I play more to see what I can do to improve the deck. If you have any suggestions to improve the deck or side deck in any way, feel free to let me know."

GX SPIRIT CALLER</strong> you collect multiple duel spirits that give your character passive buffs; to level up the spirits, their card has to be face-up on the field to gain experience when you win, nothing else.</em>  I'm not going to lie, this is a terrible deck. First thing to note, this is every Thunder-type monster in the game; one advantage is ""<em>when you win</em>"" you'll get the [Limited ATTRIBUTE] &amp; [Limited Type] experience bonus, leading to faster levelling up. Try to stall until you can summon <strong>Sanga of the Thunder</strong>, use <strong>Batteryman D</strong> as a wall to protect your field, use trap cards to destroy enemy monsters. If you can special summon <strong>Batteryman D</strong>, and combo with <strong>Aqua Chorus</strong> you'd get a wall that would stall most of the opponents. If you tribute summon <strong>Zaborg </strong>his effect is mandatory, so play <strong>Cost Down</strong> if you want an easy summon. Just use this to grind no-named duelists, until your <em>Batterymen</em>, or <strong>Wattkid</strong> (<em>Oscillo Hero #2</em>) reach max level.  <em>Side Deck</em>: If you acquired <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong> (from Blair)/<strong>Monster Reborn</strong> (from Atticus), replace <strong>Heavy Storm</strong>, or <strong>Premature Burial</strong>.

Once out, the plan is to ideally swarm the deck with level 4 dragon monsters that can be drawn or searched via Armed Dragon, the Armed Dragon's effect or DDA's effect and summing Queen Dragun Djinn to protect your dragon monsters from attacks, as well as beefing her up with Tyrant Wing or Castle of Dragon Souls to prevent her being destroyed too early after summoning.  Another strategy is to summon Armed Dragon, the armed Dragon and then using his effect to summon Azure Eyes Silver Dragon and then utilising his effect to special summon one of the many Dragon normal type monsters such as Hyozanryu or the Luster Dragons. I also packed a few Raigeki to quickly clear the field and directly attack your opponent with an army of dragons.  Another key strategy is using Dragon Ravine, Dragon Shrine and DDA to send as many Dragon type monsters to graveyard and using Dragon's mirror to summon Five-Headed Dragon."

With Machina now in full force power, The Masterduel ladder is ripe to receive Machnia's mechanized destruction!  Excellent support for the archetype includes <em>Machina Citadel</em>, which functions as a quick effect board wipe of all your opponent’s monsters which is a very potent form of interruption. <em>Machina Overdrive</em> enables a circular resource loop between the banished pile, GY, deck and hand, while <em>Machina Redeployment</em> greatly increased the consistency of the deck. Newer support from main sets like <em>Unclaspare (R4NK enabler, free special summon and foolish burial)</em> and <em>Ruinforce (4600ATK beatstick and banish recursion) </em>have also greatly increased the power for this archetype.  The resulting support turns Machina from an archetype that was a jumbled mess into a compact powerful fighting force that can succeed in a grind game. Together with high impact staple trap cards and crippling floodgates, Machina functions as an anti-meta deck versus the combo-heavy meta! Control the game, simplify the game-state, then OTK your opponent in one fell swoop with your high ATK Machina army!  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/machina-control-march-2022/"">If you want a detailed explanation of how this deck functions, click here!</a>"

Its performed better than I thought it would, but you could probably cut the hand traps and so forth to make milling and combos more consistent. The BLS is just there cuz its my favorite card, though its been more helpful that not I've found (banishing removal is nice for stuff like Chengying that don't want to be destroyed). 3 Judgment dragon is there because by the time you get it into your hand, its usually live, and being able to blow up the board is always nice. Even if it's destruction effect isn't useful in the moment, it's a free 8 star light monster you can use for something like Curious, Barron, or even Harbinger."

Just think of the endless possibilities :D,"I apologize for the long delay. I had issues of my own dealing to work out, and personal stuff going on that slowed down everything significantly. Anyways, link to the video in the description down below.  -Exo  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/eTtJ3Xz8uTo"">https://youtu.be/eTtJ3Xz8uTo</a> )  &nbsp;  So it's been awhile hasn't it? Well after a couple weeks of stress, anxiety, and endless agony; I've made a significant return that happens to be not as enveloping as the deck I made today. That deck involving a three-way orgy of absolute field builders; the deck in question (alongside a particular archetype that has been the vocal point for months) will involve more of a long game, than the usual blitzkrieg playstyle I normally would demonstrate when showcasing my decks. Rather the endgame would be to build the best board possible, regardless of the circumstances and the <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> like nukes being drawn.  So to begin with, I have the ""Adventurer"" package: the stuff that I know about, you know about, and even Konami knows too much about. Not gonna talk too much about it because it's been done one too many times already since it's inception. Next comes the ""P.U.N.K"": which despite the lackluster cardpool and (for this build) no inclusion of <a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K Ogre Dance"">Noh-P.U.N.K Ogre Dance</a>; the deck I made being a three-way, and not a two-way indicates that Ogre Dance isn't necessarily needed at the moment (although I played the card at 1 copy for the sake of being a searcher for <a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K Deer Note"">Noh-P.U.N.K Deer Note</a>). Finally comes the Tenyi package, which did come in handy for quite a bit of circumstances (such as getting a Tuner to go into <a data-name=""Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign-Chengying"">Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign-Chengying</a>, bouncing a burdening target to your hand, and Special summoning another ""Tenyi"" monster to go to into a Link Climb).  &nbsp;"

The main board you want to achieve every time is ""Decode Talker Heatsoul, Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir and Cynet Conflict."" Of course, this will not be possible with every hand, so Decode Talker Heatsoul should always be your go to card in any board you make. Those 2 draws are crucial since you run quite a good number of Hand Traps. In this build, I added 2 cards that doesn't exist in the original build: Cynet Crosswipe &amp; Grave of the Super Ancient Organism. Both are great cards. Cynet Crosswipe is an extra interruption if you already have Cynet Conflict in hand, so with Micro Coder's search, grab it. Grave of the Super Ancient Organism shuts down combo decks all together.  For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more.

The deck nobody plays, except me. But hey, I made a list, come take a look.","I explained all the cards in this deck so you better read this. Overall, this is more like a template as you can take out/add cards if you want. The side deck is just my suggestions for cards to add, and don't have to be used as an extra deck.  <strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>  <span><strong>Astral Kuriboh:</strong></span> Free level 8 for basically no cost, also grants amazing protection. Pair with <strong>Number 97: Draglubion</strong> for a near impenetrable monster, but sadly loses it's protection effect if you rank up the monster. 3 recommended.  <strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll:</span></strong> Summons by discarding a Gimmick Puppet which is great to get [Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll] and [Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler] out of the hand and into the graveyard. It's graveyard effect is very great against disruption decks. 3 recommended  <strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll:</span></strong> Just a great card overall, only downside is you have to control only gimmick puppets. 3 recommended.  <span><strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll:</strong></span> The engine of the deck, would be great if it did not lock you into only using it to summon Gimmick Puppet XYZ. It also does nothing in your hand, which is why I use <strong>Trade-In</strong>. Also a great target for <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. 3 recommended.  <span><strong>Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler:</strong></span> The fact that it cannot be destroyed by battle makes it an amazing target for <strong>Puppet Parade</strong>, it's summon from the grave effect is situational but has it's moments. But sucks as a XYZ material as it banishes itself if it would be sent to the graveyard as an XYZ material. 1-2 recommended.  <strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Humpty Dumpty: </span></strong><span><span>A great way to get Gimmick Puppets out of the hand, while being level 4 it is a great way to summon <strong>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll </strong>and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll</strong></span><span>. Also works with <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. 2-3 recommended.</span></span>  <strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby: </span></strong><span>A great way to grab Gimmick Puppets out of the graveyard, also a great way to summon <strong>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll </strong>and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll</strong>. It's graveyard effect is also great to counter negates. Also works with <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. 2-3 recommended.</span>  <span><strong>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju: </strong><span>Can be replaced by any kaiju, used to counter negating monsters. Also a free level 8 if you draw 2 of them. 3 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher: </strong><span>Another good engine card, and the primary target for <strong>Foolish Burial</strong>. Can also be used to pop your opponents monsters if needed. 1 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Desperado Barrel Dragon: </strong><span>A great card overall due to it's high attack, summoning itself when a dark machine is destroyed, and destroying up to 3 monsters and maybe drawing a card. Also a great target for the secondary effect of <strong>Heavy Metal Raiders</strong>. 2-3 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <strong><span>Monster Reborn: </span></strong><span>It's <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>, what else is there to say? 1 recommended (Limit 1).</span>  <strong><span>Junk Puppet: <span>Monster Reborn </span></span></strong><span><span>but for Gimmick Puppets, also nothing else to say. 1-2 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Condolence Puppet: </strong></span>A card that helps gets <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler,</strong> and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll</strong> to the graveyard. Also has a very nice protection effect for your Gimmick Puppet XYZ. 2-3 recommended.  <strong><span>Foolish Burial: </span></strong><span>Primarily for <span><strong>Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher </strong>but can also but used for <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler,</strong> and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll</strong>. 1 recommended (Limit 1).</span></span>  <span><strong>Machine Duplication:</strong></span> A free summons with <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll</strong>, <strong>Gimmick Puppet Humpty Dumpty</strong>, and <strong>Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby</strong>. 2-3 recommended.  <span><strong>Trade-In: </strong><span>Great way to get <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler,</strong> and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll</strong> to the graveyard as well as letting you draw 2. 2-3 recommended, alternative is <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>.</span></span>  <span><span><span><strong>XYZ Shift: </strong></span> You might not think this card is good, but trust me it works. It's strongest use is to go into <strong>Number 88: </strong><strong>Gimmick Puppet of Leo </strong>with this card and then rank-up into <strong>Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo</strong>. Not only do you no longer need 3 materials as you can just go into another XYZ monster then use this, it also lets you use <strong>Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo's </strong>game winning effect much easier, due to having 2 less materials to deal with. Can also be used to switch between <strong>Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings/Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings </strong>and <strong>Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder/Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter</strong> if you need Strings ATK or Grinders effect. Can be dropped if you want, I just think it's neat. 0-2 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Lightning Storm:</strong> <span>Since Gimmick Puppets like going second, this is a great card. Doesn't need much explaining. 2 recommended.</span></span>  <strong>Harpies Feather Duster: </strong>Wiping your opponents backrow is great as Gimmick Puppets don't have it themselves, great way to counter floodgates. 1 recommended (Limit 1)  <span><strong>Heavy Metal Raiders: </strong></span>Very good field spell in this deck as all Gimmick Puppets are dark machines (Besides Egg Head and Gear Changer but I don't use em anyway). Great way to protect all your low ATK Gimmick Puppets and the second effect is a great way to get bricky cards out of your hand. 2-3 recommended.  <span><strong>Perform Puppet: </strong><span>It's first effect is very situational but has it's uses. The secondary effect is a great way to recycle Gimmick</span></span><span>s that are banished, and can result in you sometimes getting free summons of Gimmick Puppet XYZ. 1 recommended.</span>  <span><strong>Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force: </strong><span>Needed to rank up your Gimmick Puppet XYZ, it's recycle effect is very good and can be searched with <strong>Puppet Parade</strong>. 2 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force: </strong></span>Once again, needed to rank up your Gimmick XYZ. But it's ability to negate all cards on the field is so incredibly good and can save you the game, only issue is it negates your cards too so be careful. 2 recommended.  <strong><span>Traps</span></strong>  <span><strong>Puppet Parade: </strong></span><span>The card that has single handedly clutched my games countless times. It's ability to summon up to 5 Gimmick Puppets is just incredible, and the setting of a rank-up spell is just icing on the cake. 3 very much recommended.</span>  <strong><span>Extra Deck</span></strong>  <strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll: </span></strong><span>A great searcher and can get you out of a jam, also a way to use your level 4's. But locks you into Machine XYZ extra deck if you use it's effect. 1-2 recommended.</span>  <span><strong>Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll: </strong><span>Stealing your opponents monsters is very good, but it usually gets stopped. Even then you can't attack nor summon any other monsters except Gimmick Puppet XYZ monsters. 1 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder/Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter: </strong><span>Both are great for wiping out your opponents monsters, especially since Grinder can use it's effect twice. The burn damage they both provide is great. 1-2 of each recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings/Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings: </strong></span><span>These are your monster wipes, it's incredibly satisfying to destroy all your opponents monsters they spent 5 minutes summoning. Drawing a card and the burn damage are extremely good as well, but it's second effect is practically useless. Also have a high ATK value. 2 of each recommended.</span>  <span><strong>Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo/Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo: </strong><span>Use these at your own risk, as they are usually only used for memeing. But they have high attack and disaster leo cannot be targeted by card effects, but disaster leo needs to lose all of it's materials to use it's win con, that is why I use <strong>XYZ Shift</strong>. If your gonna get rid of leo/disaster leo, drop <strong>XYZ Shift</strong> too. 0-1 of each recommended.</span></span>  <strong><span>Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star: </span></strong><span>Great protection and non-targeting removal, also bypasses <strong>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll's </strong>restriction. 1 recommended.</span>  <span><strong>Number 97: Draglubion: </strong><span>Primarily used to summon <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong>, but when paired with <strong>Astral Kuriboh </strong>is extremely difficult to get over. 1 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon:</strong> <b>≥</b><span>9000 ATK beatstick primarily used as an OTK, but has a neat side effect when it is destroyed by a card effect. 1 recommended.</span></span>  <span><strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Titanic Galaxy:</strong> <span>V</span>ery great negation and the ability to change attack target to it is also pretty good. But usually used for <strong>Number 97: Draglubion </strong>material.</span>  ABOUT NUMBER 100/NUMBER 97: If you do not want the OTK, scrap these 2 and add whatever you want. Maybe another Chimera Doll and Number 23. OR if you want to lean into the OTK but don't want to use Number 38, scrap Number 88/C88 and add Number 99 and a Chimera Doll.  <span><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky</strong> <strong>Thunder:<span> </span></strong><span><span>Duh, easy board wipe.</span></span></span>  <strong><span>Side Deck: </span></strong><span>Cards you could swap/add to the deck if you want, not an actual extra deck.</span>  <span><b>Infinite </b><span><b>Impermanence/Forbidden Droplet/Any Hand Trap: </b><span>Easy negates.</span></span></span>  <span><strong>The Beginning of the End/Allure of Darkness/Advance Draw/Pot of Avarice/Triple Tactics Talent: </strong><span>DRAW POWER!!!</span></span>  <span><strong>Glorious Numbers: </strong></span>Revive Numbers, great for N88/C88 as no materials. It's secondary effect is meh.  <span><strong>Gravity Bind: </strong></span>FLOODGATE  <span><strong>Limiter Removal: </strong><span>Honestly would put this in the deck if it wasn't over 45 already. Great for OTK's.</span></span>  <span><strong>XYZ Import:</strong> <span>Monster stealing is pretty pog ngl.</span></span>  <span><strong>Twin Twisters: </strong><span>Since they don't have enough backrow removal.</span></span>  <span><strong>Resurgam XYZ: </strong><span>Pretty decent effects but overall not the best.</span></span>  <strong><span>Marshalling Field: </span></strong><span><span>Don't use this unless you plan to drop all non machine monsters (Recommended to use Gearspring Spirit if this is the case). Actually useless, I don't remember why I put this in, oh yeah it's second effect is pretty good I guess.</span></span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Goals are to quickly have <strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> in Graveyard or Hand. Do not be afraid to use&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong>&nbsp;on weaker monsters. Just get as many monsters on the field and aim for an OTK.</p><p>There are no negations like <strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></strong> because sometimes I myself find myself needing an opponent's monster to do the OTK;&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> will not trigger since one needs to declare battle with a monster so that it can be special summoned. Hence, I decided to let the opponent run wild with their summons. Abuse of an attack positioned monster is needed.</p><p><strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> targets are usually <strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> itself to allow recyclability. One may recycle <strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> by using it as XYZ material. This way it will avoid itself from being banished even after using its special summon effect.</p><p>Do not use <strong><a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>&nbsp;</strong>on Turn 2 or later. It's only usable on Turn 1. It can be replaced with something else (preferably something that adds consistency).&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Inferno Reckless Summon"">Inferno Reckless Summon</a></strong> is a really good card to use here to bring out the copies of&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong>. Not only that, but it can also be used for the other ships with <strong><a data-name=""Iron Call"">Iron Call</a></strong>.</p><p><strong><a data-name=""Gold Gadget"">Gold Gadget</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a></strong> help with XYZ summoning and swarming the field.

Sunavalon with generic plant good stuff and Adventure engine.,"Climbed climbed from Plat into Diamond with this list, so I thought I would share it. A high impact endboard that originates from one Sunseed Genius Loci means that I have stuck as many ways to protect the combo from getting interrupted as much as possible. Maxx C and Nibiru will end your turns if you do not have the proper ways to stop them. Adventure primarily handles Nibiru, but the only way to stop Maxx C is with Crossout, Called by the Grave, or Ash Blossom. Maxx C cannot go off against this list unless you want to give your opponent 20+ cards. Other than that, this deck has a variety of ways to play past the other handtraps, as long as you open multiple starters.  The endboard of one of Sunseed Genius Loci will always be a Sunavalon Dryatrentiay, Teardrop, Benghalancer, a set Sunavalon Bloom, and a Sunvine Shrine."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.  7) Cards that have a (this card is always treated as ""card name"") can be ignored. Example Harpie Lady 1, 2. And 3 are always treated as the original Harpie Lady. In normal ocg/tcg you would have to choose the ratios from amongst them to play. But here you can run the 3 original and then 1 of each other effect harpie.  Another instance of this is ""Umi"" and card like ""A legendary ocean"" Google Docs  You can find the full community here: https://discord.com/invite/gGmy52ZEny"

Gunkan Suship is a competent deck that can be built incredibly easily on a budget with the core of the deck consisting of 6 - 12 SRs and the rest of the deck being up entirely to personal preference. You can cut on of the Gunkan traps for the 3rd Maxx ""C"" i just haven't gotten around to crafting it. Forbidden chalice can be swapped out for either Dark Ruler No More or Effect Veiler but Chalice works on a budget and I also enjoy the flexibility of it compared to those two. When building the deck i recommend prioritizing crafting Zeus + Gaia Dragon and Bagooska as these cards can carry you in games without much commitment. Blizzard is probably the best flex slot for this specific list, i personally like blizzard as hitting those equalizers if you're forced to go first is a life saver but it could be replaced with just about any meta pick you want. Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, Time Thief Redoer, Abyss Dweller and the Draco Future package are also up to personal preference depending on what you prefer in your Rank 4 tool box. Rescue Rabbit is also a viable option in the main deck but i don't like that it can end your turn if your opponent has any hand traps, i prefer not to rely on the normal summon."

Here's my take on HEROs for Master Duel.  <strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong>  Do you love GX? Do you think Jaden is cool af? Do you hecking love HERO's?  But no, seriously, as expensive as this deck is, this is probably one of the most coin flip decks that I've played ever. If it pops off, it pops the fuck off, and I mean it. If it gets interrupted enough, it falls fucking hard flat on the floor, face first. It's so strange because as oppressive as this deck can be offensively, it's also very fragile, since only a select few of their boss monsters have relevant protection, and their combo lines are so prone to interruptions and negations.  <strong>The Main Deck:</strong>  • <strong>The HEROs</strong> - <span>The heart, soul, meat, potatoes, bread, and butter of the deck. You literally can't play a HERO deck without HERO cards. Starting with the starters, then the half-starters/extenders.</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> - <span>The progenitor of every archetypal searcher nowadays. Upon its Normal or Special Summon, searches a ""HERO"" monster, which includes himself. It also misses timing when used as Fusion Material with <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Solid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Solid Soldier</a>, fun fact, which is why I've decided to cut him. I figured that out when I was deliberately finding a way to intentionally make Stratos miss timing when I realized that he has a ""When... You can"" effect.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> - <span>Your second primary starter, although it costs a discard of a ""HERO"" monster for its Special Summon, which isn't really a big deal, most of the time. You summon him to place a <a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a> to your S/T Zone for purposes to be discussed soon.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a> - <span>Not a primary starter nor an extender, but he's a vital part of your <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Faris</a> line, and the reason why I run two despite it being a hard brick, is that drawing a one of Increase hurts significantly more than drawing one out of two of your Increases, because the former scenario essentially turns off your Special Summon starter/extender in <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Faris</a>, in which you play three of. I understand the logic behind playing only 1 Increase, but that could also mean three to four dead cards, which mean you don't want to have in your hand or Deck, especially if you don't have a way to fuse. It's good to have situational cards that is there when you need them but in testing HEROs, one of the combo decks that are heavily prone to interruption, I've learned that you always want the cards that you have access to, to do something when you have them.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a> - <span>Your least ideal starter and most important extender. Ideally you wouldn't really wanna start with him, but when push comes to shove, there's still a possible line with him.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a> - <span>For now, she's just a one of searcher as the primary target for <a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vyon</a> to search a ""HERO"" monster, but as further support gets released in MD, there will be a line that allows you to search a ""Change"" Quick-Play Spell, most likely <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a>, essentially allowing you to only play it at one safely.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier</a> - <span>I'm playing this because of <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Sunrise</a>, and Normal Summoning him does come up, especially in bad hands. Plus, there's no reason not to have the usually free +1.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a> - <span>You want this dude out of your hand if you drew it and into the GY as soon as possible, both for Fusion Summoning and Link Climbing.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> - <span>Great extender that recycles your copies of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Malicious</a>.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Evil HERO Adusted Gold"">Evil HERO Adusted Gold</a> - <span>Allows you to summon <a data-name=""Evil HERO Malicious Bane"">Evil HERO Malicious Bane</a>, one of your better boss monsters, by searching <a data-name=""Dark Calling"">Dark Calling</a>.</span></li> </ol> Hand traps are x2 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Veiler</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Imperm,</a> with Nibiru only being used for the purposes of <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>, usually.  <strong>Non-Staple Spells</strong>  • <a data-name=""A Hero Lives"">A Hero Lives</a> - <span><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> for HEROs, at a very cheap cost of just half of your LP. It's a great Ash bait, and it's not once per turn in case it gets negated. <span>• <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> - <span>DPE is legal, and despite this deck being able to make him without this Spell anyway, you'd still better have it than not.</span> • <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> - <span>Your only access to your Masked HERO Fusion Monsters. As of now, it's still unsearchable, that's why I chose to play two of it. Three is fine if you feel like it.</span> • <a data-name=""Dark Calling"">Dark Calling</a> - <span>Your only access to <a data-name=""Evil HERO Malicious Bane"">Evil HERO Malicious Bane</a>. <span>• <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> - <span>Your target off of <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Sunrise</a>, usually how you'd wanna trigger <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier"">Liquid Soldier</a> to make <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Absolute Zero</a>.</span></span> </span></span></span>  <strong>The Extra Deck</strong>  • <a data-name=""EVIL HERO Malicious Bane"">EVIL HERO Malicious Bane</a> - <span>Your only boss monster that has a protection against anything, against destruction by battle or card effect in particular. Has a once per turn monster board wipe, and can also scale up his ATK upon doing so.</span> • <a data-name=""Vision HERO Adoration"">Vision HERO Adoration</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a> - <span>The former is just a generic Fusion monster that you can easily make for the grind, and the latter is there to make OTKs easier, if it wasn't easy enough. None of them are mandatory, but I'd cut Trinity over Adoration if I have to.</span> • <a data-name=""Masked HERO Acid"">Masked HERO Acid</a>, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Masked HERO Blast"">Masked HERO Blast</a> - <span>Your Mask Change targets. You'll usually make Acid with Absolute Zero to nuke both your opponent's monsters and back row, Dark Law with either Malicious or Shadow Mist to act as a one-sided Macro Cosmos, and Blast with Stratos to cut down high ATK but targetable monsters and as a Quick-Play back row removal. <span>• <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Great Tornado"">Elemental HERO Great Tornado</a>, <a data-name=""Elemental HERO The Shining"">Elemental HERO The Shining</a>,  <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Elemental HERO Sunrise</a> - <span>The Omni-HEROs. Great Tornado to cut down all of your monster's ATK/DEF to half, The Shining as a late game beatstick and can also recover banished ""Elemental HERO"" monsters when sent from the field to the GY, Absolute Zero to act as a board wipe as discussed earlier, and Sunrise to facilitate either set-up or extension through Miracle Fusion. He also boosts the ATK of all your monsters and can pop a card upon attack declaration involving another HERO monster you control. All mandatory, except for Great Tornado. <span>• <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> - <span>I don't think he needs more introduction or in-depth analysis. Just hover if you still feel like reading. <span>• <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Dread Decimator"">Xtra HERO Dread Decimator</a>, <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Wonder Driver"">Xtra HERO Wonder Driver</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</a> - <span>Your only Link Monsters. Cross Crusader is your primary searcher, you almost always want to go into him first, or at least as soon as you've already set up Malicious in the GY, Wonder Driver is your most important combo piece, and Dread Decimator boosts the ATK of all HERO monsters he points to, including himself, and can deal piercing.</span></span> </span></span></span></span></span>  Final Thoughts:  I mean, it's HEROs. They're like the Salamangreat of Fusion Summoning, and by that I meant they can easily Fusion/Link Climb and lose hard to Nibiru, but unlike Salads, they can easily close out games when given a chance to do so. Although I'm not gonna lie, it kind of gave me a sense of analysis paralysis when it comes to which ""HERO"" deck do I want to build at first. Overall, it's a protagonist deck, like Dark Magician, Synchrons, Utopia, Odd-Eyes, and Code Talkers. Its performance is as expected, and its price astronomical. From the core to the hand traps and staples, much like Dinos but more archetype specific, I wouldn't really recommend building this, unless you really don't have anything else to build in Master Duel and only want to have fun. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

Wyrm Synchro is a variant of Swordsoul Tenyi/Tenyi Synchro/Based. The goal is basically to pile in all of the best Wyrm synchro enablers into a single deck - it is all here, the Adventurers, Rose Dragon, Yang Zing, Tenyi, and Swordsoul, plus all the best generic synchro enablers. The list Farfa was running was really focused on comboing off down a pretty specific line, which I left in, but I also adapted the list to be a little bit more of a free-wheeling combo deck, with a lot of enablers and back-up plans, and many hands featuring multiple lines of play. I like flexible combo decks, and I wanted to further shore up the deck's plan vs handtraps by running more Swordsoul lines.  So, into the card by card. For interruption I wanted to be really greedy on this one, and aim towards going first. With the Adventurer pile and early Baronnes we're shored up against a lot of hand traps, but Maxx ""C"" rules the format still, and is the one interruption that might kill us going first. As a result, we're on 2 Maxx ""C"" so you can Crossout Maxx ""C"" even if you see one copy, 3 Ash, and 2 Called By with 2 Crossout. Crossout is weaker here, but it's almost exclusively for Maxx ""C"" and people run Ash. The deck is also brimming with ways to turn it into value if you don't need it. Needing 7 Maxx ""C"" answers and 2 Maxx ""C"" leaves us with no room for backrow hate, so go first against Backrow. Like I said, greedy.  Pretty standard Adventurer package here. The unusual thing about this deck is it uses the Gryphon Rider for material more often than not, but there are plenty of available lines that leave a Gryphon Rider up the whole time as well. Like I said, flexible. I'm definitely on Foolish Burial, much needed with Blue Girl and Rites semi-limited out the gate.  The whole Rose Dragon package is pretty standard. The goal here is to make Baronne before Needlefibre, but with Striker Dragon in the list your ""brick"" Roxrose goes into Halq by itself, or even helps make Baronne before Needlefibre.  Vishuda is a rad interactive card, but also helps put up the 7 you need for Galaxy Tomahawk and Baronne combos. Ashuna serves the same role, but is also a combo piece, summoning either a 7 or a 1 later into your combo to put up massif boards. Adhara is occasionally a target of this summon, and with Monk helps make Halq without your normal summon.  The big difference between the list I was sniping and my list is a beefed up Swordsoul package. With Mo-Ye and Sacred Summit the ROTA (which is normally reserved for summoning Protos) can also enable easy (and resilient) lines that end on 2 8s and a 10. This is also an option over Protos in some hands. The Sacred Summit can also help summon back monsters to extend plays in normal combo lines, it's strange people find Monster Reborn bricky. There are hands where I'd consider summoning Mo Ye instead of making Halq, especially if it preserves a Gryphon Rider and ends on a similar board.  So, the list has Protos for Darks and Chaofeng for Lights. Seems fair and balanced. Nope, nothing broken in this list.  The list can abuse Denglong, so it runs Nine Pillars. This helps round out the interruptions. The free level 1 tuner that summons itself back out is key to the combos, and well worth the brick, but there are lines that don't even need it, so I'm considering finding a line that lets me cut this. On the other hand, there's no kill like overkill.  In the Extra Deck is an Almiraj, so our Jet Synchron is now full combo (actually, there are multiple lines from just NS Jet). Deskbot helps facilitate this, and can be used as a tuner and a free summon in some hands, enabling stuff. There aren't a lot of bricks that aren't somehow combo pieces."

They do work together and have potential to grow better, but this is one of the first versions of the deck. After I get enough recommendations on how to make it better, and figure out myself how to make it more consistent, it will be updated. If this looks different, its because I updated it today, So if you end up enjoying this build, be sure to check back sometime for a more consistent version.  &nbsp;  I'm back with another Frankenstein that manages to work! Branded with a Simorgh engine and Despia support. So a few days ago I bought some Albaz strike structure decks, and remembered all it takes is Artifact Scythe or D-Barrier to shut them down entirely. So I took to the abyss of cards that is my dresser to see what I had that could fix it, and I stumbled across an old favorite Archtype of mine, Simorgh! More specifically, Dark Simorgh. It's first effect allows it to summon itself from the hand or gy by banishing both a WIND and DARK monster from the opposite. Branded Despia were all dark, and Simorgh were wind, so it's summoning criteria immediately checked out. But it's second effect is what initially caught my eye, ""Your opponent cannot set any cards on the field."" This meant that If I got it out, Branded wouldn't have to worry about Scythe Baronne, D-Barrier, Eldlich, Swordsoul blackout, or having their Mirror match use a Super polymerization on your turn. So, With that weakness so effortlessly covered, it was time to mash these decks together until they worked. This deck focuses on getting Mirrorjade, El Shaddoll winda, Dark Simorgh, and Dramaturge out while pressuring your opponent with cards like Lorpar, Sauravis, Super polymerization, and Mercourier. And so while it's end game is almost the exact same as its other variants, it's a whole lot more fun to play. The deck ended up a Pricey at roughly $138, but about $93 of that come from some easily replaceable cards, albeit it makes the deck less efficient, but $45-$62 instead. So I'll be going  over how the Simorgh engine works, And what to replace if you want the cheaper version:  &nbsp;  <b>What you'll need to buy-</b>  <span> </span>  <span>Three Albaz Strike structure decks will grant you a sizeable chunk of your deck for just $30, but you won't be playing all three copies of most the cards you do get from them, So you could Buy two structure decks and the few cards needed from the third on the side for cheaper. </span>  <span>3 Super Polymerization, 2 Aluber the Jester of Despia, 3 Branded Opening, and 1 Dragonmaid Lorpar. These are the cards that make the deck Pricey and add up to Roughly $82 on their own. These can be bought individually, or from the Dawn of Majesty set, where you also have the chance of getting the $15 fusion monster I didn't include in the decklist. Later I'll explain replacement cards for them if you're looking for a cheaper version.</span>  <span>Your entire side deck comes from Albaz Strike. Those are the big two points you need to be notified about, the rest of the cards are under a dollar with the exception of three cards under three dollars. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Simorgh engine and how it works-</b>  <span> </span>  <span>The Simorgh engine consists of  3 Dark Simorgh, 3 Simorgh bird of bringing, 2 Simorgh bird of calamity, and 3 Simorgh Onslaught. And cards that expand the engine, but aren't Simorgh cards are; 1 Dragonmaid Lorpar, 1 Tempest dragon ruler of storms, 1 Sauravis the ancient and ascended, and 2 Dragon Ravine with a Terraforming. </span>  <span>In this build, your normal summon is always used on either Aluber, Albaz, or Bird of Bringing. So the usual play goes normal summon Bird of bringing to add Onslaught from your deck to your hand. then activate Onslaught to discard a Simorgh or Tri-Brigade Mercourier to add a Bird of Calamity and Dark Simorgh from your deck to your hand. Now from here there are different ways to Discard the second monster needed to summon Bird of darkness:</span> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use Branded fusion to Send Albaz and Dogmatika/Shaddoll monsters from the deck to the gy to fusion summon Albion, then Banish Albaz and a Dark monster to fusion summon Lubellion. now you can use Lubellion's effect to discard the other monster to fusion summon either Mirrorjade or El Shaddoll winda. Then banish your wind and Dark monster from the GY to summon Dark Simorgh.</span></li> </ol> <ol start=""2"">  	<li><span> Use Branded Opening to Discard the second monster and add your Despia monster. Now you can already summon Dark Simorgh.</span></li>  	<li><span> You can use Dragon Ravine to Discard a dark monster to send Tempest, dragon ruler of storms from your deck to your gy. Now banish both from your gy to summon Dark Simorgh. For being banished, Tempest can add Dragonmaid Lorpar from your deck to your hand.</span></li> </ol> <span> </span>  <span>And Those are the common plays for Dark Simorgh, though there are others. So onto how each card in the engine fits into the deck.</span>  <span>Starting with Dark Simorgh, It prevents your opponent from setting ANY cards, nullifying one of Branded's biggest known weaknesses. Furthermore, its both a dark monster and has over 2500ATK, so it can be used as fusion material. Lastly, banishing triggers the effects of cards like Tempest, Mercourier, and can banish monsters for its summon that Lubellion can shuffle right back into the deck.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Dragon ravine has several uses. Discarding triggers Despian tragedy effect, and cards like Dramaturge and Albion make no impact on your end game, keeping your hand in good shape. Next, it can Dragons from the deck to the gy. This includes Tempest, Albion, and Albaz. Albion can then send branded opening from your deck to your gy to give your fusion monsters protection. Tempest can be banished from the gy to add Dragonmaid Lorpar from your deck to your hand, or can banish other monsters from the gy to summon itself. And Albaz is fusion material, and this helps you use Branded in red if you put it in the build(I personally didn't yet, but this is only day one of me having the deck).</span>  <span> </span>  <span>It sucks when you go first in a tournament and brick, it could cost you your spot in top cut. Bird of Bringing helps prevent Bricking on turn one by giving you a backup play. The backup play is Normal summon Bird of Bringing to add your needed Simorgh card( Onslaught if you don't have a way to get Dark Simorgh out, or, Dark Simorgh if you can already get a dark monster into your gy.). Now link summon Salamangreat Almiraj with bird of bringing, then link summon Secure Gardna with Salamangreat Almiraj. Now you can summon Dark Simorgh. and if you drew them, you can Summon Dogmatika Maximus by banishing Salamangreat Almiraj from your gy, and activate its effect to send two cards from your extra deck to the gy to add Albaz cards to your hand at the end phase to set up your fusion plays next turn, Dogmatika can be searched with Nadir servant. and Lastly set your D-Barrier/Super Polymerization/There can be only 1. Ending your turn 1 Brick with a Bang. Bird of Bringing is also your Simorgh engine starter as explained previously. It's last use is after all your plays are over, if it's in your gy, you can special summon it as a small defense during the battle phase.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Tempest has a few uses. As stated previously, it can add Dragonmaid Lorpar from your deck to your hand when banished, Lorpar can discard itself to negate a Face up monsters effect or force bait a negate. Tempest can discard itself and a wind monster(usually the second material needed to get out Dark Simorgh) to add Lorpar, Albion, Sauravis, or Albaz from your deck to your hand. Keep in mind that Tempest can only use one of its three effects per turn. Sauravis is viable fusion material, and can negate pesky cards like Effect Veiler.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Lastly, Bird of Calamity. It can send Dark Simorgh from the deck to the gy, and can revive itself at the end of your play like Bird of Bringing. Really I just needed another WIND Simorgh in the deck and it was the best option.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>And that's how the Simorgh's fuel the deck. I'm sure there are other ways to make this engine even more efficient, but this is the best I have right now. </span>  &nbsp;  <strong>Why use this variant over others?-</strong>  &nbsp;  Of course you have the question of what makes this variant better than the others. And being a mirror match, not much. It prevents set cards, and Can make more efficient use of it's hand traps like Mercourier, Lorpar, and Sauravis, and because of typing's, Dark Simorgh can stay out if you have There can be only one out. This variant also has a small backup play to make a complete brick even rarer. Consistency wise, This deck is good. So the only one ups your Mirror match will have are  Better more expensive fusion monsters.  Being able to make better comebacks.  Better consistency depending on the build.  But other than that, This deck can do the same things they can but with a major weakness covered.  &nbsp;  <strong>Making your deck cheaper-</strong>  &nbsp;  I said this deck was supposed to be budget, and its at least half to a third the price of a top tier Branded deck. but its still $138. Lucky for you, the Albaz Strike structure decks come with some replacements for these pricy cards. so who gets replaced with what?  Branded in red ends up being $6 for a little extra consistency, but, the structure decks come with Branded in White, which you can use to replace them.  Super polymerization ends up being $15, but the structure deck comes with kaiju's, so if you want to remove those monsters for less money, use the kaiju's. and if you have some spare change, you might want to look into buying Galdara the Mystery Dust Kaiju. It's a cheap kaiju all the same, but can be used as material for Dark Simorgh. Super poly can also be replaced with your side decked cards and they deck's consistency will stay the same.  Aluber the Jester of Despia comes out to $12, but can be replaced for Springans Kitt who comes in the structure deck. It lets you add the branded fusion, but you have to sacrifice a card in your hand, and it doesn't have the same synergy a Despia booster would. It does however gain a new Synergy with Dogmatika Maximus. At full first turn brick combo, Between Nadir servant Kitt and Maximus, you'll have 4 Albaz based cards ready to go next turn.  Branded Opening comes out to $45, and can't truly be replaced. So mix in whatever fills in the empty space. Without you Despia engine, the deck focuses a little more on having backrow to hold your opponent down. One idea is Anti-Spell fragrance. Since your opponent is forced to set spells, and Dark Simorgh prevents cards from being set, together they shut off both spell and trap cards entirely. And Alongside Winda, that's a job only a Kaiju could hope to take on, and not everyone plays a kaiju.  &nbsp;  In the end, if you replace all the expensive cards, you end up spending $61 instead of $130, and without Lorpar &amp; nadir servant, your down to $45.  &nbsp;  <strong>How to shut down an</strong> <strong>opponent-</strong>  &nbsp;  Eldlich/Trap stall- These decks need Traps to survive, Dark Simorgh just crushes them. So get Dark Simorgh out turn 1 and unless your opponent has a way to destroy it/tribute it, they're gone without a fight, and cards like Mirrorjade and Mercourier  help prevent your opponent from removing Dark Simorgh. If you go second though, Stall decks could hurt you for a few turns before you can finally get you're able to destroy it. Dogmatika Maximus can handle these if you added the fossil monsters to your extra deck. I don't think you can Play over skill drain though, you'd just have to attack over whatever's out with no effects. Twin Eldlich will definitely overpower you unless you can get Dark Simorgh and/or there can be only one, or a well timed Super Polymerization.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Baronne Scythe- I meant it when I said Dark Simorgh made that big difference to the deck, because yet again, Scythe can't be set. breaking that whole gimmick. If you go second though, You can use Lorpar to force bait Baronne, Clash with Dramaturge, or remove it with fossil/N'tss using Dogmatika Maximus/Nadir Servant. and set a super poly to keep them down next turn.  &nbsp;  Have fun fighting that 4-Negate Apollousa.  &nbsp;  Swordsoul- I doubt you'd be seeing these in Locals much, but, there can be only one stops them from doing anything with their monsters, and Dark Simorgh keeps them from setting Swordsoul Blackout. They can only use 1 Vishuda effect per turn, And between Dark Simorgh, Mirrorjade, Dramaturge, and there can be only one, Vishuda isn't enough. oh and D-barrier too I guess. If you go second though, force bait with Lorpar, Super Poly to remove the threat, And do your thing from there. Dark ruler no more and called by the grave are going to help a lot here.  &nbsp;  oddly enough, I don't think there's much you can do against Dragon Link.

Use its effect to boost the Naturi,"<em><i>NOTE</i></em><em><i>*</i></em><em><i> </i></em><em><i>In the start of the duel, no matter who comes first, having </i></em><strong><em><b><i>Reasoning</i></b></em></strong><em><i>, </i></em><strong><em><b><i>Foolish Burial Goods</i></b></em></strong><em><i>, and/or </i></em><strong><em><b><i>Pot of Prosperity</i></b></em></strong><em><i> in your hand may enable you to summon one of the three Synchro Naturia bosses.</i></em><em><i> </i></em>  &nbsp; <p>When taking <strong><b>FIRST TURN</b></strong>:</p> <p>(When you don’t have any of the three cards mentioned above)</p> a) If <strong><b>Naturia Marron </b></strong>and <strong><b>Naturia Sacred Tree</b></strong> are in Hand:  Set up the field by Normal Summoning <strong><b>Nat. Marron</b></strong>; send<strong><b> Nat. Ladybug</b></strong> to the GY using Marron’s effect. Then, set <strong><b>Nat. Sacred Tree</b></strong>.  You can end your turn there and anticipate the opponent’s move during their turn (it’s kind of risky, but it can pay well when it works), then if you see that they are about to Special Summon, you can use <strong><b>Nat. Sacred Tree</b></strong>’s effect (as Chain 2) to send Marron to the GY and get <strong><b>Nat. Antjaw </b></strong>to swarm the field, or get <strong><b>Nat. Dragonfly</b></strong> to hold the line from monsters with 2000 ATK or more.  <em><i>*If you are lucky to have a Tuner and </i></em><strong><em><b><i>Double Summon</i></b></em></strong><em><i> in your hand, you will be able to Synchro summon </i></em><strong><em><b><i>Naturia Beast</i></b></em></strong><em><i> or </i></em><strong><em><b><i>Landoise</i></b></em></strong><em><i> (you decide which to summon depending on the opponent’s hand, though you’ll only guess.)</i></em>  b) If <strong><b>Naturia Marron </b></strong>and <strong><b>Monster Reborn</b></strong> are in Hand:  Normal Summon <strong><b>Nat. Marron</b></strong>; send a Lvl 2 (to summon <strong><b>Nat. Beast</b></strong>) or 3 (to summon <strong><b>Nat. Barkion</b></strong>) Tuner to the GY, then special summon the sent monster with <strong><b>Monster Reborn</b></strong>. Proceed with the Synchro Summon.  c) If any <strong><b>Naturia Plant Monster </b></strong>and <strong><b>Naturia Sacred Tree</b></strong> are in Hand:  Normal Summon/Set that Plant monster, and set the <strong><b>Nat. Sacred Tree</b></strong>.  This method is kind of similar to method a), though riskier, but still rewarding when it works.  d) If <strong><b>Double Summon</b></strong>, a Lvl 2/3 Tuner, and another monster are in Hand:  The Level combination you can expect here are [Lvl 2 Tuner &amp; Lvl 3], [Lvl 2 Tuner &amp; Lvl 4], [Lvl 3 Tuner &amp; Lvl 2], [Lvl 3 Tuner and Lvl 3], and [Lvl 3 Tuner &amp; Lvl 4]. Whichever the combination may be, you’ll be able to summon one of the three Naturia bosses.  &nbsp; <p>When taking <strong><b>SECOND TURN</b></strong>:</p> <p>(When you don’t have any cards mentioned in the NOTE)</p> e. If <strong><b>Naturia Cabbage </b></strong>and another Tuner are in Hand:  You can immediately Summon an Naturia Boss with this method. And since, this is already the second turn, your opponent might have set several trap cards in their field, so I recommend trying to summon <strong><b>Nat. Barkion</b></strong>, but it still depends on the play.  f. If <strong><b>Naturia Cabbage </b></strong>and <strong><b>Naturia Ladybug</b></strong> are in Hand:  This might happen at some point where you still cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck, but your opponent has one monster whose ATK/DEF is 2400 or lower. Use <strong><b>Nat. Cabbage</b></strong>’s effect to Special Summon <strong><b>Nat. Ladybug</b></strong>; use Ladybug’s effect to boost Cabbage’s ATK, then eliminate that monster.  g. If <strong><b>Double Summon</b></strong>, <strong><b>Naturia Marron</b></strong>, and a Tuner are in Hand:  Normal Summon and use <strong><b>Nat. Marron</b></strong>’s effect to send<strong><b> Nat. Ladybug</b></strong> to the GY. Then Normal Summon a Tuner to Summon a Naturia Synchro monster. Then, use <strong><b>Nat. Ladybug</b></strong>’s effects; special summon it, then tribute it to boost the Naturia Boss monster’s ATK."

The U.A. playstyle of constantly switching out monsters with offensive capabilities with monsters with defensive capabilities after the battle phase allows for multiple plays depending on your starting hand. Some cards, like <a data-name=""The Warrior Returning Alive"">The Warrior Returning Alive</a>, ROTA, <a data-name=""Planet Pathfinder"">Planet Pathfinder</a>, and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> are added to allow you to more consistently get your level 4 monsters in your hands and the field spells which allow you to get a decent amount of card advantage for normal summoning those level 4s. <a data-name=""Witch's Strike"">Witch's Strike</a> has also been added to disrupt your opponent should any of your defense line monster's effects get negated, but you could also swap this out with backrow removal as I've found most decks don't run nearly as many negates as other formats. The best way to learn this deck is to play around with combos on your own, though if you need some tips to get started, you want to have as at least 2 of your level 4s in your hand as soon as possible, but if you have the option to create your starting offensive line (Mighty Slugger and Dreadnought Dunker are fantastic options for this), your starting defensive line (Block Backer and Perfect Ace are good choices for this), and your ""waiting bench"" line (These are cards whose effects activate/are most effective when summoned during your opponents turn, namely Player Manager for easy board control or Rival Rebounder for swarming), then you should get that set first and do everything to make sure you have at least 1 of your level 4s in hand by the end of your turn, or some way to protect it on the field or return it to the hand during your opponents turn. If you're having trouble getting over tricky monsters like Machina Ruinforce and the level 10 Floowandereeze, we run 3 U.A. Penalty Boxes for that exact reason. My current win/loss ratio with this current version during this event is 11/8, though the addition of Adventure or backrow destruction may help if you find yourself stuck often. Enjoy fantasy football as you've never played it before!</p>"

This was submitted for the Novakin Membership Anime Tournament.,"We want to get Supernova out as soon as possible.  Crimson Resonator and Wildwind can special summon themselves to the field. Step 1 is to always go into Red Rising Dragon which will get back your resonator from the GY. Crimson Resonator can activate his effect and bring 2 other resonators to the field. From here you can go straight into Supernova Dragon. Friendly Reminder: His Quick Effect to banish everything will get him back to you next turn, but the opponent's cards won't return.  If you want, since you didn't use your Normal Summon, you can bring another 4 star to synchro with one of the resonators.  This opens up more plays as you can go into other synchros like Beelze who has a lot of protection or Hot Red Abyss for a free  Effect Negate."

Noble knights are a combo based deck that have a lot of flipping through the deck, in return you can quickly dump out things like xyz monsters. Sadly it’s usually a little underwhelming. But it’s the thought that counts, right?  You see, noble knights may have recycling sources but the only way they have a follow up play is Isolde’s typical search, gearfried. So what happens now? You can’t just dump one negate on your second turn and expect to win.  Here’s where poker knights come in, not only are they effective at their job they got a lot of synergy with noble knights in they way they work.  A: though they lock your extra to light warriors noble knights themselves will lock the extra to noble knights, and most of them are light warriors with a couple exceptions.  B: they recycle the light warriors in your graveyard and refresh your hand, pretty good if you ask me  C: the queen knight s a normal, this allows it to be of use with gawayn, see where I’m getting here?  And D: they usually don’t get in the way of Noble Knights from my experience so far.  Though the usual endboard is a little underwhelming the deck has a follow up most of the time."

Dragoon as always is a good going first option, while I've had good luck with Master of Chaos as a going second card due to his mass monster banish effect (which sets itself up if you summon him with Lubellion)."

Youtube link ,"<div class=""inner-wrap clearfix""> <div id=""secondary""> <div class=""textwidget"">    A deck specifically made for Master Duel's Extra Zero Event.  This fan favourite and Starwars/Wizard of Oz themed deck returns as one of the dominant going-second strategies of the Extra Zero Event! This deck's strategy is to blind second, clear the board with board-breakers and summon giant spaceships to OTK your opponent! This deck easily OTKs with the correct cards in hand, especially with Kozmo Farmgirl or Emergency Teleport. Kozmo can also play a very competent grindgame as each monster floats into another as long as they're destroyed, allowing the pilot to beat grindy control decks like Eldlich and Flundereeze.  If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!  </div> </div> </div>"

Play it if you want to make people sad,"  &nbsp;  <strong>Watch video for games!</strong>  This deck is deceptively powerful. You will have the upper hand vs alot of the meta picks during this tournament especially Floo, but not limited to all back row decks including true draco. The decks goal is to put your opponent in a permanent stun lock of <a data-name=""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"">Eradicator Epidemic Virus , This will Ultimately cause the opponent to rage quit or have 0 % chance of winning with all their spells and traps being rendered useless. Now how do we get this lock going?</a>  Its simple, We need <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a> and we need <a data-name=""Malice, Lady Of Lament"">Malice, Lady Of Lament</a> and finally we need <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a> . This will allow you to spam search your deck for ways to get eradicator virus, cycle the virus with Malice and have a target for it with Darkest Diabolos. The Virus is particularly good Vs. Floo because they only run a certain amount of threats, so as you see in the games we show in the video once we take care of their tributes they can't recycle them anymore due to Lair of darkness being able to fill their board with tokens they cannot get rid of.  &nbsp;  The deck is very fun and hilarious to play.

I tested it vs robots and I think it performs well, it might lack something u might find it then adjust.  Main Tactic : Using high power of ATT points in the start to make it tough on the enemy. then flood summon and SP summon the field.  then re setup again if things gone wrong if possible to try direct attacks or remove enemy monsters from the field.  Effect monsters&gt;&gt;&gt;  I used the Gadgets family : starting from yellow to red and green , reason.. u summon 1 u get the other from deck so ur hand always has Lv4 coz I build it easy to rely on Lv4 Xyz to start the process  gold and Silver Gadgets very good u N summon 1 u SP another gadget from ur hand so u r setup for the process u got 2 Lv4, if Silver or gold destroyed u SP them again the minute they sent to GY so ur fielded will still have them  the enemy could sent it once but i think not twice and if he did u will SP again in the same time  Say u have gold and silver and 1 gadget say red think of this combo &gt;&gt;&gt; N summon silver or gold u get the other silver or gold then u SP the 3rd gadget so u got 3 in 1 on the board  other supporters from the same family :  1-Ancient gear gadget &gt;&gt;&gt; help u setup the board vs any spell/trap or monster effect u choose what u need and still Lv4 so u still could SP summon with another Lv4  2-Boot up soldier dread Dynamo: Defense card in bad cases so u can gain 2000 ATT points on the board if u control another gadget and still Lv4 as well  3-Boot up Corporal Command dynamo : if u have 2 u control or in GY and u will have lot of them in GY ,SP this boot up Corporal and attach both gadgets to it and u gain 2000 Att for each 1 attached this also is a defense action, also still Lv4 so ur extra deck is always open to SP  End of Gadget Family  4-Chronomaly Gordian Knot : Lv3 and could SP summon another Chronomaly monster which will be&gt;&gt;&gt; Chronomaly Cabrera Trebuchet and takes Lv 4 from it.  SO .. Gordian Knot SP summon Cabrera then Gordian Knot takes Lv4 from Cabrera u secured 2 Lv v to open the extra deck.  5- Copy cat : I found that card very useful in bad cases u copy the enemy monster ATT/DEF values and the enemy has to destroy that monster coz it will remain with same values all the time this is ATT - DEF tactic from me  6-Marshmallon : very defense use in in bad cases or to avoid some turns taking hits  7-Michon the Time Lord (this card is LV10 ): very powerful if u have no monsters u can SP summon it and cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects and if u battle with it  the enemy  lose half LP then it will be shuffled in the deck again, so the enemy has to stop or negate it's effect to destroy it.  8- Asura Strike : Buff card for Utopia Xyz monsters  Spell Cards :  1-Twin Twister : destroy 2 spell/traps in one shot to pave the board  2 Double or nothing : coming soon in Deck tactics and mechanics  3- Monster Reborn : very good in bad cases  4- Hyper Rank up Magic UtopiForce : this is key for taking 1 rank 9 or lower utopia Xyz  to get 1 rank 10 or higher utopia monster  5-Zexal Field : extra protection for Xyz monster effects and get Shining draw in the next draw + adding materials again to Xyz monsters  6- Shining Draw : use only 2nd effect SP summon again Utopia Xyz monster  7-Xyz Energy : destroy enemy monster he controls  8- Rank up Magic The Seventh One : this is the gate for Number 107 and Number C107 Galaxy and Neo Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon  9- Mirror of the Ice Barrier : good way to punish the enemy when he banish cards from yr hand Gy of field he will be punished by the same way (note) check up all Mirror traps they are very good when the enemy declare attacks  10- Reverse Breaker : extra protection for yr Utopia when declaring attacks  Trap Monsters:  I used this method to improve ways to defense and SP summon setup at the enemy turn, putting pressure on him.  1- Powerhold the Moving Battery : SP summoned when set it in trap zone before u end ur turn, once the enemy turn starts u can SP summon it and equip Golden Gadget from ur deck  or hand then it will gain double ATT of Golden gadget which will be 3400 ATT .

I tested it vs robots and I think it performs well, it might lack something u might find it then adjust.  Main Tactic : Using high power of ATT points in the start to make it tough on the enemy. then flood summon and SP summon the field.  then re setup again if things gone wrong if possible to try direct attacks or remove enemy monsters from the field.  Effect monsters  I used the Gadgets family : starting from yellow to red and green , reason.. u summon 1 u get the other from deck so ur hand always has Lv4 coz I build it easy to rely on Lv4 Xyz to start the process  gold and Silver Gadgets very good u N summon 1 u SP another gadget from ur hand so u r setup for the process u got 2 Lv4, if Silver or gold destroyed u SP them again the minute they sent to GY so ur fielded will still have them  the enemy could sent it once but i think not twice and if he did u will SP again in the same time  Say u have gold and silver and 1 gadget say red think of this combo &gt;&gt;&gt; N summon silver or gold u get the other silver or gold then u SP the 3rd gadget so u got 3 in 1 on the board  other supporters from the same family :  1-Ancient gear gadget &gt;&gt;&gt; help u setup the board vs any spell/trap or monster effect u choose what u need and still Lv4 so u still could SP summon with another Lv4  2-Boot up soldier dread Dynamo: Defense card in bad cases so u can gain 2000 ATT points on the board if u control another gadget and still Lv4 as well  3-Boot up Corporal Command dynamo : if u have 2 u control or in GY and u will have lot of them in GY ,SP this boot up Corporal and attach both gadgets to it and u gain 2000 Att for each 1 attached this also is a defense action, also still Lv4 so ur extra deck is always open to SP  End of Gadget Family  4-Chronomaly Gordian Knot : Lv3 and could SP summon another Chronomaly monster which will be&gt;&gt;&gt; Chronomaly Cabrera Trebuchet and takes Lv 4 from it.  SO .. Gordian Knot SP summon Cabrera then Gordian Knot takes Lv4 from Cabrera u secured 2 Lv v to open the extra deck.  5- Copy cat : I found that card very useful in bad cases u copy the enemy monster ATT/DEF values and the enemy has to destroy that monster coz it will remain with same values all the time this is ATT - DEF tactic from me  6-Marshmallon : very defense use in in bad cases or to avoid some turns taking hits  7-Michon the Time Lord (this card is LV10 ): very powerful if u have no monsters u can SP summon it and cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects and if u battle with it  the enemy  lose half LP then it will be shuffled in the deck again, so the enemy has to stop or negate it's effect to destroy it.  8- Asura Strike : Buff card for Utopia Xyz monsters  Spell Cards :  1-Twin Twister : destroy 2 spell/traps in one shot to pave the board  2 Double or nothing : coming soon in Deck tactics and mechanics  3- Monster Reborn : very good in bad cases  4- Hyper Rank up Magic UtopiForce : this is key for taking 1 rank 9 or lower utopia Xyz  to get 1 rank 10 or higher utopia monster  5-Zexal Field : extra protection for Xyz monster effects and get Shining draw in the next draw + adding materials again to Xyz monsters  6- Shining Draw : use only 2nd effect SP summon again Utopia Xyz monster  7-Xyz Energy : destroy enemy monster he controls  8- Rank up Magic The Seventh One : this is the gate for Number 107 and Number C107 Galaxy and Neo Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon  9- Mirror of the Ice Barrier : good way to punish the enemy when he banish cards from yr hand Gy of field he will be punished by the same way (note) check up all Mirror traps they are very good when the enemy declare attacks  10- Reverse Breaker : extra protection for yr Utopia when declaring attacks  Trap Monsters:  I used this method to improve ways to defense and SP summon setup at the enemy turn, putting pressure on him.  1- Powerhold the Moving Battery : SP summoned when set it in trap zone before u end ur turn, once the enemy turn starts u can SP summon it and equip Golden Gadget from ur deck  or hand then it will gain double ATT of Golden gadget which will be 3400 ATT . U can also use any gadget but I use golden gadget coz it has the highest ATT of 1700 among all gadgets in the deck which will be doubled from 1700 to 3400 .

But if you think that 7 Reloads is a bit too much you can throw the Marrillas out for 2 Dogmatika Punishment and have more removal.

Only one of each Level 8 Kaiju. I wanted to keep Kaiju count as small as possible to avoid drawing too many Kaijus. Having one more Kaiju doubles your chance of drawing too many Kaijus (two or more) from 5% to 10%. Luna and Alpha can bounce Kaijus back to your hand for another use. Slumber is a decent board clear - but also its GY effect can come in useful; especially if your opponent mills it for you (eg: Zombie Vampire).  Ecclesia tags out into a Level 8, Iris Swordsoul. You'll want to target Luna or Ecclesia with Sauge de Fleur and chain their effects to Sauge's targeting to gain extra value. Iris Swordsoul isn't ideal to draw but its summoning condition might not be too hard to meet (using your imperms or your opponent's negates). If you're lucky it could even be disruption on your opponent's turn.  Handtraps also serve as a backup normal summon to synchro Psychic End Punisher. Ogre is backup E-Tele target as well."

Probably not but let's try anyway.","A budget version of my main deck from Master Duel intended for real play, the deck is focused entirely on going second and winning off of 2 level 8's into Dragluon into Numeron Dragon.  Going first, the best option is usually to set up Spirit Dragon and sit on it unless you absolutely need to go into Azure-Eyes, although Hope Harbinger is also very good.  The deck actually does pretty well in the long game as long as the opponent can't remove True Light, as a free reanimation every turn represents serious inevitability.  The deck's biggest weakness is bricking hard from all of the random dragon garnets.  Since I had to drop a huge amount of the handtraps I would normally be playing over budget concerns, more hands should be able to combo, but the caveat is that breaking the opponent's board is so much harder.  At least kaiju are good at that, not to mention how well they interact with a Relinquished Anima summoned off a White Stone.  My rule for deckbuilding was no card with a TCGPlayer average price over $10, although I did allow one exception in the form of a singular Bingo Machine Go that can be searched off True Light and find either of the Blue-Eyes starters.  If I had more budget, I'd have 1 Abyss Dragon to find Chaos Form, 1 Heart-Earth for going first, 1 Soldier of Chaos as a banisher, maybe 1 ZEUS for control, 1 Star Eater to synchro with Ash, and some combination of additional Imperm, Droplet, Lightning Storm, Ash, or even Droll and Lock.  I'd also note that the sidedeck is half being used here as a maybeboard so don't give it too much thought."

Streamlined and built more around the upcoming POTE meta.,"Konami has confirmed that the new Mayakashi support will come out in November in the ""Magnificent Mavens"" Holiday Box. Knowing this, and thinking that the meta won't shift far from Tearlaments and Spright by November, I wanted to make a ready-to-play Mayakashi deck for when the deck finally becomes playable in the TCG. Granted, Mayakashi isn't going to be tier 1 or the like, but I feel this specific build is strong enough to take on the upcoming meta.  One thing about Mayakashi itself is that it isn't strong enough to function on its own. It has a strong going-first combo that can easily result in a pop, two negates, or more, but it cannot play through negates and it cannot go second. To remedy this, I've included the Eldlich engine, which I feel can fill both of the niches. I've also included a small Zombie World package because of how well it works with Mayakashi and Eldlich.  &nbsp;  A few notes:  <span>3x Yuki-Onna, The Icicle</span> Mayakashi - This card does everything for the Mayakashi archetype. Not only does it allow you to link climb into Yuki-Onna, The Absolute Zero Mayakashi, it also allows you to special any of your synchros during your opponent's turn. Because of this, I decided to play 3 along with 2 of the link-2, because you can link up and down, which allows you to dump 2-3 of this card into your GY in a single combo chain.  <span>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</span> - I like this card not only because it works against Tearlaments, but also because it can insulate your combos from D.D. Crow as well as keep Dakki in the GY. Granted, D.D. Crow is much better in the Tearlaments match-up, so I've also thrown in two in the side deck.  <span>No Crossout Designator</span> - I experimented with this card for a while because stopping Nibiru, The Primal Beaingis so crucial in this deck, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it's not really a worhwhile addition. 9/10 times my opponent would have a Nibiru + another hand trap (which is really hard for Mayakashi to play through) or I would just not draw Crossout. I eventually figured that, even if I did get Nibiru'd, I could just fall back on the Eldlich cards or slap a Zombie World down and sit on a couple of hand-traps. I decided to substitute Crossout with Triple Tactics Talent since it could snipe hand-traps or just act as a Pot of Greed. I prefer to play only two, though, as drawing more than 1 makes for a very bricked hand.  <span>1 Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi and Shiranui's Tale</span> - To me, this card is a gimmick/a win-more card. I will say, if you can pull this off then you will win the game (usually), but so much has to go right in order to resolve this card that it really isn't worth playing more than 1. Your Hajun, which is an negate magnet, has to resolve, Dakki can't be D.D. Crow'd or Ghost Belle'd, and the field cannot be Nibiru'd, AND you have to have either drawn this card (without letting it brick your hand) or have searched it with Mayakashi Return. The best part about this is that it's a searchable trap that can be used with Eldlich the Golden Lord, and that it can recover a banished Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi. The full Mayakashi combo is strong enough without this, anyways.  <span>Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</span> - This card is the most consistent to summon monster to out high attack monsters that are unaffected by card effects (e.g. Psychic End Punisher).  &nbsp;  I really love Mayakashi and want this deck to be the best it can be. Any and all comments/criticisms are welcome."

Have Mystic Piper and Kinka-byo be your only normal summons and try to thin out your deck via playing the Good Stuff&trade; and having Piper be a recurring Pot Of Greed. You obviously are not going to win with Piper. He is there to take up your normal summon slot and allow you to draw into answers. The primary win condition to this deck is via the Extra Deck or the Adventurer Token engine. I wouldn't suggest building this deck at all.

There are a lot more plays that can stem from this but this is the bare bones Plans for what this deck is gonna do. I will break why each cards are in the deck and what they do here.  <strong><span>The Monsters: </span></strong>We're running an Onomat(The Dododos, Dadadas, etc) engine in this deck due to them being able to spam themselves out onto the field for Rank 4 plays with Utopia double and Xyz that need 3 materials like Number 104. With their searching spell card they are good at what they need to do. ZS - Ascended Sage plays really well in this deck since it's a free special summon on an empty field and it searches our Rank-up-Magic limited Barian force when used to summon a utopia monster. Utopic Astral Hope is alright in this deck since it's also a special summon but it's only when you have an Xyz Monster(s) o the field. It also has a searching effect but the discard cost makes it situational. Astra Kuribo is just a free special summon as well as providing protection to our Xyz monsters when used as material, shame that protection goes away when we use our Rank-up-Magic on said monster; Pretty good overall. Ash-Blossum is just a good handtrap so :3  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells:</span></strong></span> Onomatopickup and Onomatoparia are our searching spells to add our Onomats to our hand. Prime Discard targets for Onomatopaira are Utopic Onomatopoeia(can be revived with Zybababancho Gagagacoat) and Dodododwarf and Gogogoglove(can revived itself). Ascension of the Seven Emperors is the new support that came out recently, it searches out our Rank-up-Magics and Barian Spell/Trap cards as well as setting up Barian Chaos Draw for our next draw phase; Really nice card to have in this deck. ZEXAL Construction is another spell searcher that can add, ZS - Ascended Sage, Zexal Contruction, and any NORMAL(can't search Rank-up-Magic Quick Chaos unfortunately) Rank up magic spell card; although instead of discarding for cost you need to send a card from your hand back to your deck, good targets for this are Double or Nothing, Rank-up-Magic the Seventh one and Barian's Chaos Draw.  For our Rank-up-Magics we are running two Limited Barian's Force and Urgent Chaos; these are just the generally best choice for this deck. Limited Barain force is pretty flexible with being able to turn any Rank 4 in our deck into a Number C106 for a field negate. Urgent Chaos lets us dodge targeted effect by ranking up our Xyz Monster, Rank-up on our opponent's turn, rank-up during the battle phase to get an extra attack in, and it's our rank-up-magic that can rank-up Number 107 into Number C107 since Limited Barain force can only work on Rank 4 monsters. Rank-up-magic the Seventh One and Barian Chaos Draw allow us to cheat any Number C10x out from the extra deck, we can do this semi consistently with Ascension of the Seven Emperors; you only really want one of each of these to not have Bricky Hands.  Memories of Hope is an interesting card, it can potentially allow for a lot of Draws when our board is created(With the bare bones plan for this deck involving at least 3 Number Xyz Monsters hitting the Field, we can get even more Number Monsters depending on our starting hand) but you'll only get the maximin benefit after achiving our end board so you'll end up not using the card until the end of your turn. Potentially it can end up being a useless card if you cannot bring out any Xyz Monsters but the reward of being able to draw more cards is also pretty good. It's good enough at 2.  Double or Nothing is needed for Utopia Double effect, you can also go for an OTK if you want with Utopia since it is in the deck. Called by The Grave helps with dealing with handtraps. Zexal Feild allows us to attach one of our Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck to our Xyz monster, use this to attach a monster to THE KAISER to allow it to summon 3 Number monsters from the Extra Deck.  <span><strong><span>The Trap:</span></strong></span> Eternity of the Seven Emperors is our only trap in this deck, it allows us to add a negate to our board which isn't half bad. It's a shame that we can only search it with Ascension of the Seven Emperors.  <strong><span>Extra Deck:</span></strong> Our extra deck consist of only Number Xyz Monsters and Number C monsters.  <span><strong><span>Utopia:</span> </strong></span>Used to activate ZS Utopic Zage's Search if you can't summon Utopia double. Use Rank-up-Magic Limited Barain's Force to turn it into Number C106 for a field negate. You can also go for an OTK by going into this card with Utopia double.  <span><strong><span>Utopia Double:</span></strong></span> used to go into THE KAISER or Utopia  <strong><span>THE KAISER:</span> </strong>Use this to cheat out our Number Monsters. Know that you can't special summon after using this effect as well as damage you deal being halfed for the rest of this turn.  <span><strong>Number 101/C101:</strong></span> Pretty good removal and the Chaos Number has a decent Floating effect.  <span><strong><span>Number 104/C104:</span></strong></span> You want Number C104 since it's one of this decks few disruptions on your opponents turn. Really good card if you can bring it out.  <span><strong><span>Number 105/C105:</span> </strong></span>Number 105 is a pretty fun card overall if you crash into a big card. Number C105 has some targeted Destruction with some burn damage effect. Both just ok cards.  <strong><span>Number 106/C106:</span></strong> Easy to make cards that can be a plan B for this deck if you can't bring out THE KAISER  <span><strong>Number 107/C107:</strong> </span>Number 107's effect only will be meant to deal with Battle Traps/effects so it end up being situational. Number C107 is a feild Negate as well as being the one of the Biggest Beaters in the Deck. You cheat these card out with THE KAISER and The Seventh One.  <span><strong><span>Barian Hope:</span></strong></span> Can be a pretty big beater but it's copying effect usually requires a bit of set up to work. Really wish we got a re-train for this card that can use the effects of Card's attached to itself. Neat Card tho.  <span><strong><span>Side Deck:</span> </strong></span>The 4 Xyz monsters were considered for this deck but they have problems; You cannot bring out Number 102 normally so you need to bring it out with Kaiser and if you rank it up into Number C102 then you can only use it's effect once. Number 102 /C102 are very situational since most deck don't modify their attacks and this deck doesn't have a way to change the opponents monster's attack. Then was have spell/trap removal with Feather Duster and Twin Twisters.  I hope you the person reading this can have some fun with this deck. It's not that great but that's alright. Just go have some fun with some freinds. Good Night fellow duelists."

OUR draw phase.,"50 cards, but you rarely draw a hand that doesn't have a starter. Not the most powerful deck, but usually pretty good!  Invoked plays on your turn, Generaider plays on theirs. Generally your best turn 1 board will be some combination of Mechaba, VFD, Boss Stage, and DPE. Mechaba and Harr are generally enough to stop most hands. Against Floowandereeze, summon Caliga to shut off their gimmick. You aren't making Accesscode often if at all, so feel free to replace that line with whatever you want.  Target Mechaba or any level 9 Generaider with Monstrosity for an instant VFD. Only use it to summon from hand as a last resort.  Droll synergizes really well with this deck since you can make them draw cards, then make them discard one with Harr and chain Droll to stop them from searching again that turn."

""Son bienvenidos mis amigos""  -Exo  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/F3bFd8R3YXc"" data-name=""https://youtu.be/F3bFd8R3YXc"">https://youtu.be/F3bFd8R3YXc</a> )  &nbsp;  A little early for any significant religious holidays; but not too early for any significant deck that came out from the mother herself. Now is it really the most significant and obscene defensive deck in the current day? The answer to that is sadly no (that would be Eldlich and all his forms). However with Konami almost ready to unban her cards from the banlist (after so many years), we can easily argue that it's a lot better as a potential anti-meta deck (and more fluent than possibly Nekroz). Not to mention with the most recent support that came out in the OCG is soon to move it away from it's floodgate like strategy, which is kinda nice honestly.  &nbsp;  Now at most, True Draco is pretty easy to understand and play for those who want to learn archetype based strategies (almost as easy as interpreting some parts of the Catholic Bible). For starters, this archetypes continuous Spell/Traps run on tributes; their effects trigger with tributes; and they can be tributed for tribute summoned (for monsters such as <a data-name=""Majesty Maiden, the True Dracocaster"">Majesty Maiden, the True Dracocaster</a>; but can also be tributed using any other faceup continuous Spell/Trap on the field). Their recovery spell, <a data-name=""Disciples of the True Dracophoenix"">Disciples of the True Dracophoenix </a>is by far their most useful card for play extensions (in my opinion). Not because it recovers important cards such as <a data-name=""True King's Return"">True King's Return</a>; but it cleans out the Graveyard to make use of a very important hand trap I tend to try to make use of, <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a>. Other floodgates such as <a data-name=""The Monarchs Erupt"">The Monarchs Erupt</a>, <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a>, and <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> had made significant impacts to halt any sudden movements against more fast paced decks (like Braded-Despia, P.U.N.K, and Floowandereeze).  &nbsp;  That being said, the most massive issue that True Draco does have is the fact that (besides that generic floodgates do backfire on itself) it's worst matchups are against other stronger, more fluent floodgate decks that don't mind cards that dodge the effect of <a data-name=""The Monarchs Erupt"">The Monarchs Erupt</a> (mainly Eldlich). I'm for certain that this is because True Draco doesn't have a strong enough archetype based card pool that Eldlich has; but that isn't the case. Rather it could be the reality that the archetype in general isn't as fast pace as it was back in it's prime, compared to what came afterwards."

Live/Evil Twin is my favourite Spright version in concept, aided by Ultimate Slayer/Artemate Slay and hyper-consistency. In the ","Live/Evil Twin is where I want to start in the new meta. While Tearalaments might be a better medium term investment, both of the new Tier decks are also liable to be splashed as engines for years to come - they're simply too good at what they do. They're also liable to get limited or banned. This version of Spright isn't as dependent on Toad, so if Toad goes the same way it did in the OCG this version remains very strong. However, Toad makes Spright Elf much stronger, and I will run it while it is legal,  There are basically 2 engines in the deck - the Spright engine, which easily puts up negates but locks us out non link/rank/level 2s, and the Live Twin engine, which draws cards and pops/sends cards, but locks us into fiends. Having said that, there are combos that put up Trouble Sunny with lots of negates, and combos that are happy to just put up Ki-Sikil with Elf, Red, Toad, and Carrot. Cool, flexible combos. Evil Twins is also much better in this deck than in any other deck - Live Twins can actually summon the card quite easily, and it will help but the numbers on the board, and has occasionally helped break a board or two. Having Evil Twins and Sunny in the deck also means the deck actually puts up attack points really easily, and has great lines to OTK.  Into the card by card.  3 Starter, 3 Blue, 3 Jet. I don't think you NEED to play full numbers of all of these, but these are the Spright starters, and I think in TCG I'm gonna start on all 3 of each. Starter plays through Droll if you activate before the main phase, so this card gets much better in TCG where Droll is one of the cards you see more often in the absence of Maximum ""C"". Blue and Jet are fine. They're full combo by themselves, and 9 Spright starters makes sense to start at (though I could see myself going as low as 7). 2 Red, 1 Carrot, none of the bad one. I just don't want to run a bad honest even in pure Spright, tbh, but at least there it makes sense as a searchable 1 of. In the Twin build it makes significantly less sense, since you can OTK way more easily and aren't counting on always seeing a Spright. 2 Red makes a lot of sense to me, not only am I happy seeing Red, but I'd like to search a second on follow-up sometimes. 1 Carrot is... Fine? A spell/trap negate that pops is actually pretty good, it insulates us from Imperm, and it is always useful, but I don't think I need or want a second to ever show up. 2 Spright Smashers makes a lot of sense, it's an out for floodgates that is also good removal and searchable, and realistically I already like Cosmic Cyclone and Paleo Dinomiscus, this is just those but better in every way. If you're smart with this card it gets much stronger, but also 1-for-1 removal is solid.  I'm also FOR SURE running 2 Ultimate Slayer, with bricks in the extra. Sending Toad can be cool and useful in the deck, but really we're trying to hit a Link, Synchro, or Fusion and get a free 2-for-1. Dogmatika cards already really helped Evil Twin, and people have started maining Evil Twins in weird decks to run this card, whereas here it is totally free. So, yes, in the main. Realistically, if it isn't Spright or Tearalaments I'm not too worried about having a dead card anyways, except against Exosister, which is a bad matchup going second either way, and still a pretty good matchup going first. The rest of the format is screwed, and Slayer is still good against most of it. I give it less than a month before everyone and their dog is on 1 Evil Twins with some Slayer main, but in our deck Twins is also an Engine card, a tool for creating OTKS, and a tool for breaking boards. The card is better (in Twins) than I think non-Twin players recognize, but it really does help hit the numbers, and it has helped force out interruptions for me, and occasionally even broken boards.  For other Twin engine cards, I'm on 3 Live Lil-La, 2 Live Ki-Sikil, 1 Ki-Sikil Frost, 3 Sunny's Snitch, and 1 Password. Lil-La is preferred to Ki-Sikil because summoning Frost is access to a free draw 1. The engine locks you into Fiends out of the Extra Deck, while the Sprights lock you into 2s, so you have to choose between using Toad and Trouble - Trouble to break boards, Toad to stop them from making them. They also enable Spright plays by themselves though, and Frost even literally helps make Toad. 3 Snitch is great, theoretically it could win you on time, but the LP actually matter reasonably often given the archetype's generally low ATK points. We only run 1 Password because realistically it should almost never want to search out Evil Twins and is nearly always going to just be more copies of Snitch that lose to Droll.  We're on Toad and still want to full Spright combo with the Twins sometimes, so we've got the whole Frog engine. These numbers are pretty standard, not much to say. Seeing a Swap Frog is fine-to-great and you need enough Frogs to send. Dupe screws up the plan of beating over Sprights and Twins. Ronintoaden enables the Toad plays.  For hand traps, I'm on 7 with another brick - 3 Ash, 3 Gamma with a Driver, and the obligatory Called By. Ash wins over Imperm here by being generically good at stopping milling, wheras Gamma wins by protecting early plays like Starter and Snitch, as well as being a Level 2 that summons itself out to enable combos.  In the extra deck, I have some bricks for Slayer - Wind Peg and Omega as options vs Synchro Monsters, and N'tss to deal with Fusions. The deck also naturally wants to run Sunny and Toad, which are also great sends for Slayer. The goal here is to get a targeted 2-for-1 off of Slayer to very Specifically break Spright and Tearalaments boards.  2 of each Evil Twin is just about perfect. Because we're on Slayer, I'd consider a 3rd Trouble, 2 to grind and 1 to send, but I think these numbers are fine, enabling some grind game with the Twins, but also being able to put up a good turn 1 board whatever we're locked into. Toad is our best negate, and Elf lets us loop it in addition to being a great grindy card. Gigantic Spright enables Toad lines and can also help OTK, but even when you're locked into Fiends you can still make sweet plays with Red, Carrot, and Djinn Buster with Trouble.  The side deck is very targeted - let's fuck up the end boards of Spright and Tearalaments, with a little extra focus on ending backrow and outing the Mine, with a little extra respect paid towards Branded Fusion versions of Tear, on the basis of Anti-spell really messing with that deck, but also just being deadly going first against pretty much every generic deck floating around the meta."

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.  7) Cards that have a (this card is always treated as ""card name"") can be ignored. Example Harpie Lady 1, 2. And 3 are always treated as the original Harpie Lady. In normal ocg/tcg you would have to choose the ratios from amongst them to play. But here you can run the 3 original and then 1 of each other effect harpie.  Another instance of this is ""Umi"" and card like ""A legendary ocean"" Google Docs  You can find the full community here: https://discord.com/invite/gGmy52ZEny"

Common Questions  Q:Why only two pendulum calls?

Use predator counters to shut down Spright (and pretty much any other Xyz/Synchro strategy), as well as to negate effects with Dragostapelia.

Diviner + Halq make Elf to special Diviner to send Arc Light and search Benten. Afterwards use the Geek Boy and Benten to go trough the Libromancer line. The end board would be Spright Elf, Libromancer Doombroker + set Intervention, Baronne, set Scythe and Geek Boy (I:P if you have an extender).  You use the Elf on the opponents turn to special Diviner to send N'tss and pop the Scythe. Jet, Dagda and Wonder Magician are there for if you get interrupted but can still make Halq. I don't own Pot of Prosperity yet, but it would probably be a great include in the deck."

During your opponent's turn use Mathmech super factorial to target up 3 Mathmech monsters including Diameter to XYZ summon Laplacian and you can use I:P to link summon Apollousa.  <hr />  THE MOST KNOWN OTK COMBOS ( SECOND-GOING BOARD)  1- ACCESS CODE(needs at least 3 cyber monsters on the field): Link Splash Mage --&gt; use its effect to summon 1 cyber monster from GY --&gt; Link Update Jammer --&gt; Link Transcode talker --&gt; to use its effect to summon Update Jammer --&gt; Link to summon Acesscode talker --&gt; Update Jammer chain link 1 Access code talker chain link 2  2 - Geomathmech Final Sigma(Mathmech Nabla + any other cyber monster): use Nabla's effect to tribute one other cyber monster you control to special summon Mathmech Multiplication then use Mathmech Multiplication double its level than synchro summon Geomathmech Final Sigma than use Nabla and Multiplication effect in the graveyard to double ATK point and the number of attacks  <hr />  now since we explained the combos time for SIDE DECK LESSONS  Nibiru: well like most of you know for the upcoming format playing Nibiru is a bad move but this deck can lose to Nibiru depending on saturation but a good cross-out target also for people who say Nibiru can't stop Spright true but again depending on the saturation.  Lightning Storm and Harpie's feather duster and Red reboot: To remove back rows it's necessary as you all know  Mind control + Change of heart: just to increase the control power of the deck no need to say both are still the best cards in-game  Dimensional barrier: this card can stop many decks like Swordsoul + Branded Despia + Tearalament + Spright and etc  The dark ruler no more: this card is 100% good, especially  in this format actually the powerful way to get rid of Spright full board in case you didn't draw any hand traps  Silent graveyard or new name forbidden graveyard: if you remember the Drytron Meta format this card was an amazing counter for Drytrons and now it's a good Side against Tearalament if they can't use any effect in their Graveyard they are dead because they can't mill or fusion summon.  basically, this was the best side deck I could ever make for the upcoming format.  <hr />  Hand Traps  Ash blossom + D.D. Crow + PSY-Framegear Gamma + Effect veiler + Infinite impermanence  1 effect veiler for cross-out effect well let's be honest impermanence is better than effect veiler but we need at least 1 effect veiler  this deck usually doesn't lose to ash blossom or d.d. crow  or impermanence or effect veiler, it depends on saturation  Hand traps this deck might lose against or 100% lose: Nibiru + Droll &amp; lock bird + PSY-Framegear Gamma + Ghost ogre + Ghost belle  but since in this upcoming format playing Droll and Nibiru and belle and Ogre is a bad move you might be in a good spot with this deck  <hr />  Last notes let's get over 6.000 views and help me break my record, and promise me 1 thing if you are going to play Mathmechs make sure to defeat everyone XD,  OK till the next deck list which is going to be Tearalaments.

For going first we have thunder king, doomcaliber knight, necrovalley, dimensional fissure and deck lockdown. For going second we have denko, ash blossom, kaiju engine, pankratops and eater of millions. Also i run other supports like pot of extravagance for draw power and cosmic cyclone mainly for banishing annoyimg floodgates the opponent might have (and its useful simce its a quick spell). I tried to krep the balance between going first and going second plays, while minimizing the contradictions between the cards. The only contradiction i have noticed is kaijus slumbers second effect that contradicts thunder king, necrovalley and deck lockdowns effects, but this effect will most likely not be used since most of time i wont need to search a kaiju, unless i dont have pieces to play."

If your opponents make the mistake of letting you go through with our dear Farmer girl, it's GG 9/10 times, fetch whatever you need to ramp up you monster from level 3 to level 8 (you can skip some, don't worry) and look as your opponents' LP deplete to 0 while you still have like 1 or 2 summons and attacks to do.

Throw it in the shadow realm and bring a spaceship to the field through whatever logic this game has! The evil opponent is making your new beautiful ship explode?

This is a mixed Cyber Dragon list, designed to be capable of breaking boards and OTKing but also very capable of setting up a negate or two, setting backrow, and passing. The idea is you don't know whether you're going first or second game 1, so you tune between games (when you have a guess) and the maindeck tries to balance both.  Into the card by card.  3 Core. Normal Core, add Overflow is a line I actually like in Cyber Dragons. It can also search Cyberdark Realm to open up OTK lines, or summon another 5 to make Infinity. This is just your main starter, and you want to run 3. 3 Emergency, Rota for the deck. Core searches this, this searches Core, pretty basic stuff. The second effect doesn't come up, but mostly because people usually play around it, (and because Ass Blossom works fine) so you're winning on that one anyways. 1 Repair Plant. We're running 1 Kaiju in our boardbreaking suite, but mostly this is just an easy back-up Rota, and it'll allow you to string Rotas. 3 Overflow, best card in the deck. It's an amazing Trap card on its own merits, but it is also insane bait, and I always want to play 3 of this card. 3 Cyber Dragon and 1 Toon. Part of the reason I think this deck is good is that breaking an Elf in the EMZ is easy when you see any Cyber Dragon. These cards are also insane against Machines thanks to Fortress, which isn't huge in the meta, but comes up. 3 Herz. Herz is great to equip to a Regulus, and important to send off of Rampage, and is also just another good Cyber Dragon. Picking itself back up is usually my preferred play to searching Cyber Dragon, but the fact that it recovers itself, or a Core in the GY, or searches Cyber Dragon makes it a great toolbox card. For Cyberdarks I'm on 1 Realm, 1 Chimera, and 1 Power Bond. Power Bond is great to see in this deck, especially going second, and I love the utility of Core + any Spell/Trap equaling popping 2 backrow, picking back up a core, and then OTKing on an empty board. Chimera is weirdly useful on it's own as well, so really you have 3 good cards to add a good engine to Core. I like that. I'm running 1 searchable Cyberload Fusion and 1 Overload Fusion. These cards help push for game by making Rampages, pretty self explanatory. I think Power Bond is actually better than either, and I'm considering cutting either or both of these, but I like running a lot of Cyber Dragon cards in the deck. That's the whole Cyber package.  For Machina cards, it's a pretty simple engine. The real Chad goal is to draw 1 or our 2 Redepoloyments and then use Megaform and Irradiator to summon Citadel. But Citadel can be revived from the GY if Regulus gets popped, or when Irradiator pops itself to summon Megaform. The idea is we have a few brickier cards, but also a lot of chances to put up Citadel while setting up for Regulus and searching Cyber Dragon. It's a 1 card thing that'll break a board pretty easily, though it isn't that helpful against Winda, it's a solid line to save for Splights after pushing through negations. Then we have 2 Regulus, 1 Disco. It's a free extra negate going first, and leads to the potential board of Infinity + Overflow + Regulus + Citadel. Pretty hard to push through that.  For hand traps, my goal was to settle on board breaking cards, but lean heavily on ones that could be set in the even I am going first. So there's 1 Jizikiru. It just makes sense to run in this pile, it's less about searching it and more about a free Kaiju being a early play going second in the deck. 3 Imperm and 3 Droplet - I think these cards are great going first or second, and should contribute to the deck's ability to break boards. I decided to run Lightning Storm over Raigeki or Cosmic in the main. it isn't as good in a grind game, and is outright bad (or at least usually dead) going first, but it flexes as a way to out floodgates while pressuring through (or blowing out_ negations.  Extra deck is mostly about making Rampage and Zeus going second, but Infinity is appealing going first, and it runs a single Durendal, which punishes searches but can also trigger Overflow while negating things, and is pretty good generic negation actually. Lyna is to search Cyber Dragons, Anger Knuckle is a recursive way to pitch cards and threaten Citadels, Sieger mostly enables Rampage plays, but also has a useful battle-protection effect, and Almiraj lets you put Core or Herz into the bin to enable Regulus plays, Repair Plant searches, and many other shenanigans, including their GY effects (though Core will almost always have to wait a turn).  3 Raigeki are super useful for targeting Spright and Tear boards, 3 Cosmic are for Mine and Floodgates, but are also sweet tech cards in a variety of matchups - the effect is deceptively strong if you use your head. After that I felt I was running enough cards to break boards and OTK going second, so the real switchup was going first cards. 3 D Barrier is an insane floodgate effect when you've set up your board, and after that I settled on the Solemn Brigade - Judgment because you need to protect all of your traps, and Strike because the card is also really good when you're going second, because sometimes pushing through and simplifying the game state then setting Overflow can be enough to clear the board once your Counter Trap ends the chain. The basic idea was to be as generic as possible with the blowouts and tech cards, with maybe the exception of the more targeted Raigeki, which is still generically pretty good, especially alongside Lightning Storm."

Well then, do I have a deck for YOU!","<p>Tenyi Swordsoul has been wrecking the ranked ladder for about 2 months now and is clearly Tier one. It is consistent, powerful, great going first AND second, and to top it off, the art is amazing. But, Swordsoul doesn't only help the Tenyi monsters make a Non-effect monster and win, they also help every other deck that uses the Wyrm typing.

Ding Dong on its own is amazing for more reasons, but they both search <a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a>, an Omni-Negate that Shuffles into the Deck and procks the Floating effects of the Yang Zing (which notoriously <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/If..._You_Can_VS_When..._You_Can"" rel=""nofollow"">miss timing</a>). On top of this, Zefraniu searches <a data-name=""Zefra War"">Zefra War</a>, a quick effect pop on the opponent's turn, and Ding Dong can Foolish any Wyrm (Like the Tenyis), is a tuner and can be made off of Adhara + any 4. to facilitate this play, we are playing a Zefra package to help use this and go second.

And finally, 2 </a><a data-name=""Zefraath"">Zefraath</a><a data-name=""Zefraath"">, the glue that holds the Zefra package together. It allows you to basically foolish your Zefraniu for summoning and can complete your scales extremely easily. the one bad part about the card is that it is horrid in multiples, so we are only playing two. </a>With the Tenyis, I opted to use less, due to the size of the deck becoming just too big. As for the ratios, <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Ashuna represents any other of your Tenyi monsters, so we play three. </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">Adhara</a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna""> and </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Vishuda are both at two just for space, but they are always available to you, so it isn't that big of a deal.&nbsp; </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana""> is at one, is amazing, and should be standard in every build.

It truly is amazing. Notably, I am not playing&nbsp; </a><a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a><a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">. In all honesty, I think that Vessel is superfluous for the deck, due to Ding Dong and Taia being better Foolishes for the deck, and you do not generally need the Tenyi search.</a> The Swordsoul engine in this deck is standard so this part isn't as in-depth. The only interesting this here is the 1 Taia, instead of the standard two. This is due to the number of Pendulum monsters in the deck (Reminder that Pendulum monsters <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Pendulum_Monster#Sent_face-up_to_the_Extra_Deck"" rel=""nofollow"">only go to the grave if discarded or detached via Xyz Material</a>) conflicting with its effect. The non-archetype cards in this are quite standard. Ash, Maxx ""C"", and Called By is just the Master Duel tax. Halq is just in there because I already had him, but you can easily cut him. The rest of this will be a quick overview of the interactions and things to know in the deck to play optimally.</p><ol><li>If the chain that Nine Pillars is activated, Destroying Zefraniu, has more activations of cards earlier in the chain, even if they are negated, Zefraniu will miss the timing, not searching War. Don't you just LOVE timing rules :)</li><li>Using the Zefra Yang Zing monsters as a Mo Ye reveal is extremely crucial for some plays, and if you need to search for one, ALWAYS search for Zefraxil. This is due to Zefraniu being almost useless in the hand, unless for a Pendulum Summon (You do need to play 2 just in case you lose access), and Zefraxi being the opposite scale.</li><li>You will most likely not end on an 8 Synchro AND a 10 Synchro, but you will most likely end on one OR the other + Nine Pillars + Monk. Which is most likely better.</li></ol>"

This version is actually pretty brutal, it has the same ceiling as the previous version, but more power when going second. The goal of the deck is to put up negations and then swing for game all at once. It's named after the 3 support spells that will ""full combo"" - Therions DISCOliseum, Cyber Emergency, and Magical Meltdown. The idea is to put up Mechabas and Regulus, and fuel them by using the recursive power of Herz, but Chimeratech plays really round the strategy out going second.  Into the card by card.  5 Therions cards, 3 Regulus, 2 Disco. You always want to see this card, but you never want to see 2 copies, so we run exactly 5. The goal is to equip this with Herz and use the Herz to fuel Mechabas. We're also maxed out on Aleisters. Oddly enough, with The Light we can make Mechabas without this card, and there are okay plays that don't see an Aleister, but Aleister is our main starter and a key combo piece. Terraforming also the 6th copy of Disco in addition to being the 7th Aleister. 2 Invocation to go with the package, partially to bait the Ash, but the card is also fine to see with Cyber Dragon cards. We're on 3 Power Bond. This is an OTK enabler that also makes really big Mechabas while setting up the GY, and you want to see this card more than Invocation whether going first or second. For Cyber Dragons it is 3 Herz, 2 Cyber Dragon, and 3 Emergency. Your goal is to use Herz as fusion material, search a Cyber Dragon, maybe even use it to break boards, equip Herz to Regulus, recycle Herz, and maybe pitch it again to Mechaba, or just use it to fuel 1 Mechaba ad infinitum. We're also on 2 of The Light: Hex Sealed Fusion. This card is bonkers with Super Poly, but it is mostly just here to enable Mechabas when we don't see Aleister (it's also a Cyber Dragon monster for the purposes of Chimeratech Rampage Dragon, and a backup Polymerization sometimes.) After that, I wanted Board Breakers and Cosmic Cyclone. We're on the Ultimate Slayer package with the 1 Evil Twins as a brick in the main. Going first, negate negate negate. Going second, clean up and sweep."

This is generally done through the use of interactive spells and traps that complicate the opponent's ability to enact their game plan efficiently and counter their attempts to solidify a board presence, followed by a Chaos Sorcerer/BLS-fueled Return from the Different Dimension that will ideally see your foe's LP drop to 0 when all is said and done.  I've only recently returned to YGO/GOAT Format, so the sideboard is currently serving merely as a pool of cards for consideration for the Chaos Return strategy. This will continue to evolve and eventually take shape into a serviceable sideboard to combat dominant decks and archetypes (at the time of writing this in July 2022) such as Panda Burn, Chaos Turbo, Warrior variants, and Control variants."

Here is where I have landed.  For interruptions out whole game is about Maxx ""C"". With Adventurers and early Baronnes, I felt pretty insulated from most other hand traps, and with the deck's extreme power level I feel pretty confident in my ability to win when Maxx ""C"" doesn't resolve. As a result I'm on 2 Maxx ""C"" for Crossout (and its own power) and 3 Ash, both Called By, and 3 Crossout, taking advantage of the card being unlimited in Master Duel.  Adventurer package is pretty standard, but this deck is unusual in using Gryphon Rider as material more often than as a negate. We're also on 4 of the 7s for the Tenyis, with the Rose Dragon package, another thing unlimited in Master Duel that is limited in another format. After that the deck is basically just combo pieces, any Halq or Galaxy Tomahawk is probably game if it doesn't get interrupted, so most 2 summons will just immediately take over the game."

Usual Process: <ol>  	<li>You'll almost always want to start out with Force Strix. Make it with Mimicry if you can so you can use its graveyard effect when detached.</li>  	<li>Get two more level fours on the field. I usually accomplish this with Singing and Raider's Wing if I have one of the two in hand (Stained Greaves can also be used if you start with it and search Raider's Wing).</li>  	<li>Link into Wise Strix and activate its effect to summon from your deck. Get Mimicry if you haven't used it yet, otherwise it doesn't matter.</li>  	<li>Summon Raider's Knight. Use its effect to go into Stranger. Search Skip Force with Wise Strix.</li>  	<li>Use Skip Force to summon Arsenal Falcon. If you're going second it may be worth it to go into battle phase and use your 2-3 attacks with Arsenal. Otherwise use it to summon Strangle from your deck. You can then use Strangle's effect to be able to summon another Rank 4.</li>  	<li>After using Arsenal's effect you can use it to link into Bardiche. Its graveyard effect will allow Ultimate Falcon to be summoned.</li>  	<li>Using Bardiche's effect to send Silent Boots to the graveyard will let you search 2 spell/trap cards. What you want depends on what Rank 4 you summoned. <ol>  	<li>For Force Strix you'll want Fog Blade or Phantom Knight's Claw along with Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic. Rank Up into Revolution Falcon-Air Raid for a monster destruction and to activate Bardiche's card destruction effect.</li>  	<li>For Steelswarm Roach you'll want 2 Fog Blades or a Fog Blade and Phantom Knight's Claw.</li>  	<li>For Abyss Dweller you'll want 2 Fog Blades.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> Things to Keep in Mind: <ol>  	<li>Strangle Lanius's self-summon locks you into Dark monsters, stopping the summon of Abyss Dweller.</li>  	<li>Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic locks you into XYZ, stopping the summon of Wise Strix and Bardiche.</li>  	<li>Some good searches with Mimicry or Force Strix: <ol>  	<li>Singing Lanius. Can be special summoned with an XYZ monster on the field.</li>  	<li>Strangle Lanius. Can be special summoned with a dark monster on the field.</li>  	<li>Raider's Wing. Can be special summoned by removing an overlay unit from a dark monster, and also allows Stained Greaves to be summoned from your hand.</li>  	<li>Mimicry can search Phantom Knight's claw. This is a spare negate if you already have full combo.</li>  	<li>Mimicry can search Pain Lanius. If you're opening with Tribute Lanius you would only have to 400 damage in order to summon it.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Arc Rebellion can be summoned by Raider's Knight or by Phantom Knight's Rank-Up-Magic. This monster can very easily hit for game if you're going second.</li>  	<li>Stranger Falcon, Revolution Falcon-Air Raid, and Arsenal Falcon all have floating effects.</li>  	<li>Fog Blade can bring back Bardiche or another Phantom Knight with their Graveyard effect.</li>  	<li>Skip Force can use its graveyard effect to bring back Ultimate Falcon or another Raidraptor XYZ from the grave.</li>  	<li>Steelswarm Roach's effect only applies to summons that don't start a chain, making it mainly only useful against Synchro or Tribute decks. You may want to replace it with another Raidraptor XYZ or another Rank 4 such as Time Thief Redoer. Satellite Falcon is decent choice as it can clear your opponent's backrow and its quick effect essentially lets you reduce a monster's attack to zero.</li> </ol> This is the main deck that I play in Master Duel and it's fairly consistent and makes a pretty resilient end board. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Let me know if you have any suggestions for improving it!"

If you expect a lot of Tearalaments and like playing control, this could be a good deck.","Altergeists can facilitate Necrovalley, and Necrovalley seems really good vs Sprights, but more importantly, could be gg vs Tearalaments. This is a version of Geist built to facilitate Necrovalley.  So, 0 Hand traps outside of Imperm. Imperm + Faker is brutal, but otherwise our plan is to set backrow. 3 Faker, the best Geist, 3 Meluseek, good removal and it searches Faker, 3 Mario, you need names and it is technically a sort of starter, 1 Pooquery, card is fine, being able to pop off for a bit is nice, 1 Konq, 2 Silq. These are the standard numbers, nothing flashy here.  I wanted to run Necrovalley, and I wanted is badly enough to run Terraforming and Metaverse. Metaverse is weaker here than in most Geist decks, because Necrovalley shuts down Haufiness BS and makes Orange Herald into mill 5 less terrifying, but Metaverse triggers Multifaker, so it makes the cut. The only other spell I wanted to run was 3 Pot of Extravagence. Free draw 2 in the deck, and the deck needs the card advantage in 2022.  2 Protocol with 1 Manifestation and 3 Spoofing are pretty standard numbers. Manifestation is turned off by Necrovalley, but you still want to have it in the deck even though you can play through Valley fine. You still want access to those lines when Necrovalley isn't on the board, and it is a fine bluff when it is. Imperm and the Solemns are pretty standard. It seems like Compulse is pretty good right now for monster removal. and Dinomiscus is copium for Mystic Mine.  3 Secret Village are here for games 2 and 3, when the backrow sweepers will all be coming in. The only exception is Vs Tear, where Necrovalley is completely worth it. The Mix of D. Barrior and D.D.G. gives us turn skippers to fit in instead of spot removal. Artifact Sanctum + Scythe is a second turn skipper alternative.  For Backrow I need Harpie's because of Mine, but Red Reboot and Evenly are too appealing next to Multifaker to pass up."

Phantom Knights, Adventurer, DPE, Scythe, and Eldlich rolled into one package. Extensive deck guide included.","<h2>Backstory:</h2> On paper, this deck should not work. Well, the PK/Adventure/DPE part of the deck would obviously work, but why am I playing an Eldlich engine and a 60-card deck?  The answer: <em>I am insane.</em>  I also really enjoy confusing my opponents. Now I am a firm believer in the 40-card deck. It's mathematically sound, extremely consistent, and promotes good deckbuilding. However, I truly believe that the Phantom Knights, thanks to the addition of Predaplant Verte Anaconda, Artifact Dagda, and the Adventurer cards into Master Duel, have such absurd degrees of consistency that you can get away with running this deck at 60 cards. This deck just somehow <em>doesn't brick</em>. Every hand is playable, and going first or second, the deck is capable of playing through an incredible amount of disruption. Due to this incredible consistency, you are able to add 3 Crossout Designators and as many targets for it as you desire to a standard PK deck. When you're done with that, you're left with just the perfect amount of cards to splash in an Eldlich engine. Though it may just be my sweet spot for the Eldlich cards, I actually do believe it has incredible synergy with both the PK and Adventurer engines. Due to the major cost of cards in both engines being to discard a card from your hand, this 'cost' is quickly turned into another power boost for the deck, as your Eldlich cards are free targets for this cost. The Eldlich cards are also extremely good at covering for the weaknesses of the remainder of the deck. It is really easy to power through your resources with Phantom Knights, only to have your entire board broken and wiped by a deck designed specifically to do those things; this is where Eldlich steps in. His incredible recyclability and generally sticky nature allows you to power through the game even after most of your powerful cards have been extended. He is also the best way this deck can deal with powerful field negates, as Eldlich's GY effect is a floating effect, allowing Eldlich to be immune to targeted field negation. Overall, I think Eldlich was a good choice for rounding out the basic concept of a 60-card Phantom Knights deck.  &lt;!--more View Decklist--&gt; <h2>The Decklist, Explained:</h2> <h3>Main Deck:</h3> <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Effect Veiler&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Effect Veiler</strong></a> - This card was put in as a target for Crossout Designator, but in niche situations can be made into Predaplant Verte Anaconda or Artifact Dagda. In hyper-specific scenarios, it can also be used to make Crystron Halqifibrax to facilitate a link climb into Knightmare Unicorn for those particularly hard-to-out cards.  <strong><a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a></strong> - This card is easily the most powerful handtrap ever printed and if its effect resolves, will single-handedly win you the game, as it will either floodgate your opponent out of summoning, allowing you to easily gain an advantageous board position, or fill your hand with half the cards in your deck, allowing you to combo out of or break any board you may face. It's also a target for Crossout Designator, as you will likewise automatically lose if this card is resolved against you.  <strong><a data-name=""Junk Forward"">Junk Forward</a></strong> - Junk Forward is your basic combo starter; with this card plus any other level 3 monster in the deck, including itself (of which there are 22), you are capable of making Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. If you open Junk Forward and Water Enchantress of the Temple or Rite of Aramesir, you can just use him to make Predaplant Verte Anaconda or Artifact Dagda as you see fit.  <strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a></strong> - This card is a basic Phantom Knights engine piece, when it's in the GY, you are capable of searching ANY Phantom Knights card from your deck. Typically, you will do this to search The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots, which is PK's basic combo extender.  <strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a></strong> - This card is Phantom Knights' basic combo extender. When you have any other PK monster on the field, you can summon this card from your hand. If you open Silent Boots and any other PK, you can normal summon the other PK to special Silent Boots and make Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. Silent Boots also has the neat GY effect of searching the powerful PK traps.  <strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a></strong> - Ideally, you want to get Ragged Gloves in the GY as fast as possible, as he allows you to swap him out for any other PK monster in your GY, and there are many, many good targets for this.  <strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></strong> - This card is incredible for three different reasons. One, it's an incredible hand-trap that if played wisely enough can effectively end your opponent's turn prematurely. Two, it's a level 3, meaning you can use it to make Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss, which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. Three, it's a tuner, which means it can be used to make Crystron Halqifibrax in a crunch to link climb into Knightmare Unicorn for those hard-to-out cards.  <strong><a data-name=""Danger?! Tsuchinoko?"">Danger?! Tsuchinoko?</a></strong> - This card fits this deck perfectly for countless reasons. It's a level 3, so it's capable of making Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss, which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. It's a free special summon regardless of it gets hit by its own effect or not, but if it doesn't get hit by your effect, it's also a free card draw. It can also be discarded for the cost of The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche or Fateful Adventure to summon it for free. You can also summon multiple Tsuchinokos per turn with this effect, meaning opening multiple in your hand isn't even a downside. Having this card in your hand ever is just a straight-up advantage for you in literally any scenario.  <strong><a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a></strong> - This card is a free special summon with any other level 3 on the board, meaning it's capable of making Cherubini Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss, which is your free ticket to every single card in the Adventurer engine without even drawing it. It's also a target for Emergency Teleport.  <strong><a data-name=""Psychic Tracker"">Psychic Tracker</a></strong> - This card serves the same exact purpose as Wheeleder, but has a different name allowing you to use both Wheeleder and Tracker in the same turn.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan</strong></a> - Nyannyan is in the deck specifically as a target for Emergency Teleport. When any level 3 (there are 22 in the deck) is summoned to the field, she can be revived from the GY for free to make either The Phantom Knights of Break Sword or Leviair the Sea Dragon and by extension, Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder in niche situations. Just be careful when you use her GY effect, as you will be locked into only the deck's Xyz monsters (a hard-drawn Fusion Destiny for Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer is allowed, too) for the turn.  <strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a></strong> - Torn Scales is easily the strongest Main Deck monster for PK, as he has an on-field and in GY effect to gain advantage. His field effect allows you to discard a card and send any PK to the GY, which are both beneficial things for the deck. His GY effect allows you to summon him after banishing any other PK card from your GY, making him your best monster to chain into more Link monsters. Be careful with his field effect, however, as activating its effect after Normal Summoning him locks you out of the Adventure cards.  <strong><a data-name=""Water Enchantress of the Temple"">Water Enchantress of the Temple</a></strong> - This card being at 2 in Master Duel means nothing to this deck thanks to Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss. If you don't hard draw her, you can just send her to the GY by his effect and gain access to every card in the Adventurer engine.  <strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a></strong> - Celestial is one of your targets for Fusion Destiny to make DPE, chosen due to its GY effect to Pot of Greed (draw 2 cards) if your hand is empty.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Artifact Scythe&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Artifact Scythe</strong></a> - An obscenely powerful card you only have to play one of thanks to the absurdly accessible Artifact Dagda, requiring only 2 monsters with different names as its materials. Destroying this card during your opponent's turn allows you to lock them out of their Extra Deck, winning you the game instantly (when going first) against most decks.  <strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Destiny HERO - Dasher</a></strong> - Dasher is one of your targets for Fusion Destiny to make DPE, chosen due to its GY effect to Special Summon a monster you draw.  <strong><a data-name=""Wandering Gryphon Rider"">Wandering Gryphon Rider</a></strong> - A free, recursively searchable negate with the added bonus if it being really hard-to-out due to its effect to send itself back into the deck after negating an effect. This is typically your target from Fateful Adventure.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Eldlich the Golden Lord&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Eldlich the Golden Lord</strong></a> - Eldlich is an obscenely powerful monster on his own, and is capable of fitting into many, many places. Has a powerful hand effect and a powerful GY effect and is the deck's best answer to field Monster negates. He is also extremely recyclable and decently hard to out.  <strong><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a></strong> - Though primarily a target for Crossout Designator, as Nibiru happens to be a great weakness for this deck, if you somehow draw it going second it will single-handedly win you the game against a lot of decks.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Foolish Burial&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Foolish Burial</strong></a> - An extremely diverse card with an endless amount of applications for this deck. Good targets include: Water Enchantress of the Temple (for access to the entire Adventure engine), The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak (for a free PK search), The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales (for a free summon), and Eldlich the Golden Lord (for a powerful and hard-to-out boss monster).  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Reinforcement of the Army&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong></a> - Another extremely diverse card with an endless amount of applications for this deck. Good targets include: Junk Forward (for a free summon), The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak (for a GY search), The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots (for a free summon), and The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales (for a +3 in card advantage if all of his effects are used properly).  <strong><a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong> - Target for Verte to make DPE. If hard-drawn, makes your life easier, just make sure it's the last thing you play on your turn, as it will lock you out of summoning in this deck.  <strong><a data-name=""Rite of Aramesir"">Rite of Aramesir</a></strong> - One of the most heinous one-card combos ever put in the game; this card allows you to have the entire Adventurer engine at your disposal. It's searchable by Water Enchantress of the Temple (who is, by extension, searchable by Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss), and when played, summons a Token and allows you to activate Fateful Adventure. You can then activate Fateful Adventure to add Wandering Gryphon Rider, Special Summon Wandering Gryphon Rider to get Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon for free and equip it to the Token. At the end of this card's combo, you have a once-per-turn negate and bounce to hand. This deck also makes it incredibly easy to gain access to all of these cards.  <strong><a data-name=""Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon"">Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon</a></strong> - You typically don't want to hard-draw this card, and thanks to the deck being 60 cards, it's incredibly rare you will. When equipped to a Token, allows you to bounce 1 card to your opponent's hand per turn. Also, has a revival effect on send to GY.  <strong><a data-name=""Fateful Adventure"">Fateful Adventure</a></strong> - Card can be activated by Rite of Aramesir. Another card you don't typically want to hard-draw, but it's not even that bad of a situation if you do. It allows you to search any Adventure monster, which you will typically use to grab Wandering Gryphon Rider. This card will also give your Token Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon when you summon.  <strong><a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a></strong> - This card is a great combo starter, allowing you to summon any level 3 or lower Psychic from your deck. You will typically want to target Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan with this effect, as it can be recycled into a Rank 3 Xyz monster later on in your turn.  <strong><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> - This card is a powerful answer to handtraps and also a fantastic counter to decks which need their GYs to play the game. It also is a fantastic target for Crossout Designator, as your deck would really enjoy access to its GY.  <strong><a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a></strong> - This card is obscenely powerful in Master Duel, due to many staples and hand-traps being relatively copy-pasted from deck to deck. This card allows you to negate any card in the game so long as you have it in your deck. Due to this, this deck runs many 1-ofs of problematic cards which may stop you in your tracks.  <strong><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></strong> - This card is really good for breaking boards, and it has the incredibly nice added bonus to load your GY with monsters from your hand or field, which, in this deck, is a fantastic thing.  <strong><a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a></strong> - This card is a good way to provide protection to monsters that typically do not have protections, and in your GY, allows you to summon a PK monster for free.  <strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a></strong> - This card is a free summon if you don't have any cards in your GY, at the cost of being a level 4. It's searchable by Silent Boots' GY effect, making it particularly useful for making Artifact Dagda and Predaplant Verte Anaconda (though it will have to become Link Spider first).  <strong><a data-name=""Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine"">Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine</a></strong> - This card allows you to Special Summon Eldlich from your deck and can be set by the GY effects of Huaquero and Conquistador.  <strong><a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a></strong> - This is PK's scariest trap card, allowing you to the negate the effects of a face-up monster on the field, which can severely hinder your opponent's gameplan.  It has a nice GY effect of allowing you to summon any PK from your GY for free.  <strong><a data-name=""Huaquero of the Golden Land"">Huaquero of the Golden Land</a></strong> - Eldlich support card that essentially acts as an extra Called by the Grave if you have an Eldlich. Can also be discarded by any discard effect to get an Eldlich during your opponent's turn.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Conquistador of the Golden Land&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Conquistador of the Golden Land</strong></a> - Eldlich support card that allows you to destroy any face-up card if you have an Eldlich. Can also be discarded by any discard effect to get an Eldlich during your opponent's turn. <h3>Extra Deck:</h3> <strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong> - One of the most powerful boss monsters in YGO history. Can be easily made by practically any deck with any two Effect Monsters linked into Predaplant Verte Anaconda, which this deck is more than capable of doing. It destroys one card on your side of the field to destroy any other card as a Quick Effect, and can revive itself each Standby Phase after its destruction. It has the added bonus of being able to destroy a Set Artifact Scythe on your opponent's turn to lock them out of the Extra Deck, automatically winning you the game against most decks when going first.  <strong><a data-name=""Leviair the Sea Dragon"">Leviair the Sea Dragon</a></strong> - One of the deck's two Rank 3 Xyz Monsters. They are incredibly easy to make in this deck, though Leviair is intended for games that have drawn out a bit long, allowing you to re-summon a monster that was previously banished, either to revive your Eldliches or recycle your PKs who have already used their GY effects.  <strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a></strong> - One of the deck's two Rank 3 Xyz Monsters. They are incredibly easy to make in this deck. Break Sword is essentially a diet DPE, allowing you to detach a material to destroy one card on your side of the field and one card on your opponent's field. It's a very efficient way to get out Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder, as it has an okay body and a way to free up a way for it to attack directly. If this monster attacks at all, you can make Zeus for free in Main Phase 2 to board wipe the opponent without triggering destruction effects or immunities.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</strong></a> - If you manage to attack with either of the deck's two other Xyz monsters, you can make Zeus in the Main Phase 2 for a Quick Effect board clear that doesn't trigger destruction effects or immunities.  <strong><a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a></strong> - Link Spider allows you to turn any of the Trap Normal Monsters (i.e., The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine, Huaquero of the Golden Land, and Conquistador of the Golden Land) into an Effect Monster in order to use them as materials for Predaplant Verte Anaconda, Accesscode Talker, or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World.  <strong><a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a></strong> - The easiest monster for this deck to make, as well as the most important. If you have any two level 3s on the field, you can make Cherubini. His effect allows you to send any level 3 monster from your deck to the GY <em>as a cost</em>, allowing you to do it <em>even when Cherubini is negated</em>. You will typically use this effect to send Water Enchantress of the Temple to the GY, which will gain you access to any card in the entire Adventurer engine with its combo. If you hard-drew Water Enchantress of the Temple or Rite of Aramesir in your starting hand, you can instead use this card as a Foolish Burial. He can also be used later on to make The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche.  <strong><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></strong> - Crystron Halqifibrax was primarily added to the deck to help make Knightmare Unicorn a bit easier to access, as this deck can sometimes only afford to Link away two of its monsters, as many of the other ones you'd rather stick around. With any monster and a tuner, you can make Crystron and then make Unicorn.  <strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a></strong> - With its extremely generic materials, Phoenix is an easy and great way to remove frightening backrow from your opponent.  <strong><a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a></strong> - This card allows you to Set Artifact Scythe directly from your deck, allowing you to lock your opponent out of their Extra Deck extremely easily with DPE.  <strong><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></strong> - This card is so incredibly powerful in practically any deck in the game, as it allows them to access powerful Extra Deck monsters that the deck should probably not have access to. It was even recently banned in the TCG due to its power. Luckily, it's still legal in Master Duel and can be abused extremely easily in this deck. Use its effect to make DPE, then pop your Artifact Scythe in their Draw/Standby Phase to make your opponent cry.  <strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></strong> - This deck relies heavily on destruction effects, so monsters immune to destruction pose a serious threat to this deck, making Knightmare Unicorn a necessary addition to this deck's toolkit. It can get rid of those monsters without actually destroying them, saving you a lot of headache.  <strong><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a></strong> - This card makes an incredible amount of tempo for you in PK decks, allowing you to send any PK from the deck to the GY <em>and</em> giving you a free PK Trap. It can be made with Cherubini plus any DARK Monster after you use Cherubini's effect.  <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</strong></a> - As it is not very rare that you will end up having boards of 4, 5, and sometimes even 6 monsters by turns 2, 3, and 4, Apollousa is a no-brainer in the deck, as it allows you to negate many effects from your opponent's monsters on a non-once-per-turn effect.  <strong><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></strong> - Accesscode is your deck's easiest way to close out games. Any time your opponent has taken any amount of damage, they are in serious threat of you being able to kill them due to this card. This card will gain 1000 ATK times the Link rating of a Link monster used for its creation, which in this deck can possibly be as high as a 5000 ATK gain. On top of this powerful stat boost, his effects cannot be responded to by opponents. He also gets the ridiculously strong non-once-per-turn effect to destroy enemy cards at the cost of banishing a Link monster from your field or GY, which you will gather an obscene amount as this deck plays 11 of them.  <strong><a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a></strong> - Underworld Goddess is another way to get rid of problematic boss monsters that your opponent has, bypassing nearly every protection in the game, as it is using your opponent's monster as a material. When on the field, it also grants you some pretty powerful effects. When the card is summoned, it negates all of your opponent's face-up monsters until they die, and it can once-per-turn prevent your opponent from summoning from the GY, which something a lot of decks do nowadays."

There are alot of combos between these two archetypes. More than I could represent here.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>[Darklord combo]</span></strong>  The best way and the main way for the deck to get big beatsticks on the Board. The main way to get Darklords on the Board is to find a way to get them to the grave. This is extremly simple due to there effects. Everything you need for one combo is Ixchel and one Darklord card. (preferebly Superbia) By discarding Ixchel and another Darklord card you'll be able to draw 2 cards. With Darklord Contact or Banishment of the Darklords you will be able to summon those two Cards back on the Field to either use them for a link summon or a fusion summon. Nearly every Darklord has a second effect you can pay 1000 lp to activate a darklord card from your graveyard. Nearly every Darklord card works like Ixchel and therefor its extremly easy to have 4 or more monsters on the Field at once.  <strong><span>[Despia combo]</span></strong>  The Despia Cards work as a support for the Darlord cards. With Aluber you will be able to get the Despia Fusion spell with which you will be able to summon the Darklord or despia Fusion monsters.  <span><strong>[Fusion Monsters]</strong></span>  The First Darklord has a special effect that triggers when you summon him with darlord Morningstar as Material. You will be able to destroy every card your oponnent controls.

Unlike many other of my decks this one had thought put into it (lol, I used to just make Mashup decks on a rainy ay cause I'd nothing better to do). Now I, like most duelists, have mixed feelings about POTE, because, though I always love new cards and new formats, Splights &amp; Tearlaments are extremely powercreepy &amp; Splights might even tiptoe towards Tier Zero (and once the Ishizu cards come out the same could be true for Tears).  But like the old saying goes, if you can't beat 'em join 'em. So if you can't beat Tearlaments, join Tearlaments (go to hell Splights).  This deck should be fairly recognizable. Humble Branded Despia players will know the combo so I'm pretty sure I don't have to sit here and say ""Use Branded Fusion to send Albaz &amp; Tragedy...""  However I should explain Darklords, &amp; with that explanation comes me telling you that typically your to NOT (when using this deck in particular) send Trag with Branded Fusion, instead you'll be sending Archlord Kristya to make Albion, then with Albion make Mirrorjade. See Darklords is just an engine to make The First Darklord, which has a effect to reborn your dumped Kristya to lock your opponent from specialing.  This should be an easy concept to grasp. And though the deck sometimes won't have a god hand and won't be able to make The First Darklord to sum Kristya, it will still be able to use not only Despian &amp; Albaz cards but also Tears in order to hold down the fort.  Darklord Ixchel should ideally send itself along with Darklord Superbia to draw 2, then later revive Superbia with Darklord Contact. Superbia summons another Fairy, all to get you the materials to make The First Darklord,(your fusion card being the Despian Field) or Condemned Darklord. Like I said sometimes your hand won't be able to make The first darklord, but you still might have a draw 2 &amp; don't forget your friends the Tearlaments!  I admit I'm not yet a Tears master, but I expect those of you aspire to be know at least the basic combos. The field gets you the one you normal summon, and you use that to dump then fuse. The Tears effects, along with Tragedy's, can be triggered by Branded opening, so if you send trag you can grab Ad Libitum or Aluber to do the Mirrorjade+Chimera play, and if you send a Tear you can fuse.  The deck can brick but many times won't. The ratios seemed right to me &amp; work but if you try this out feel free to do whatever, like add a third Despian Field to make it easier to go into the first darklord. Side deck customizable, I just put in stuff.  If you have questions I'll try to answer, if you have suggestions I'll gladly consider, and if you have a comment it's okay to let it out. Pls enjoy &amp; make this deck better any way you can.  &nbsp;"

The Dragunity Couse can be used for both a level 4 and a level 6 synchro monster, for a level 6 synchro, you recommend<a data-name=""Gaia Knight, The Force of Earth""> Gaia Knight, The Force of Earth</a>, <a data-name=""Powered Inzektron"">Powered Inzektron</a> or <a data-name=""HTS Psyhemuth"">HTS Psyhemuth</a>.

I feel this version is much better than the metalcruncher version, because it gives you the same tools as the cruncher version except with more options for felxibility and power. This version is just as good when playing thru hand traps but offers more powerful end boards and follow up.  This version can easily fit 12 - 15 handtraps/tech cards if you cut 1 forward and the revolving switchyard package and play 40-44 cards. I like having the switchyard and extra derricane bc it leads to more chances to end on lvl 10xyz and also regulus negate. When you draw a lvl 10 it also leads to getting regulus bc then you can search it with river stromer.  The deck is very complexed and has some of the most power when it comes to turn 3/ follow up plays, and board breaking. If you learn this deck inside out it can be an extremly powerful deck. It also currently not a target of any banlist threats."

But let's be honest, U.A's are 2 or 3 powerful cards away from being somewhat competitive. They have Omni Negates, Disruption, and the Power to hang with some decks. They just lack consistency and a Boss Monster. Hopefully the version I have made will fix that. By using U.A Signing Deal and U.A Hyper Stadium, you can easily flood the field with 2 or move Level 5 warrior monster to summon Idaten. By using Ultra Poly, not only can the summon not be negated, you can also special summon the monsters used for the summon back to your field. Their effects are negated but U.A's gimmick is swapping other U.A's out and special summoning others U.A's. Essentially, all you need to do is tag them out and tag them back in with their effects active.  The version I have made is budget, so obviously you can swap out cheaper cards with more expensive if you are willing to invest which would make the deck even more powerful. Overall, I hope you Enjoy!"

There are no good reprints and playing pure Dark World just gives headaches.</strong> There are 6 archetypes in this deck to solve problems. It's still weak against common anti-meta trends. The underlying idea of this deck is to have many routes and ways to play. Feel free to add more cards like Adventurer, Shaddoll Schism and That Grass Looks Greener. *Tearalaments Kaleidoheart is a Fiend &nbsp; The current Dark World (pre-release) is full of weaknesses and bricks that Konami will not cover, and likely nothing can be done anymore. &nbsp; <strong>Some explanation for the card of choice in the deck list:</strong> Tri-brigade Mercourier - Though a dead card on its own, quite useful if you need a continuation by banishing it with Dark World Ascension. Zombie Vampire - One of my favourite Rank 8 cards. It provides continuation play when needed, helps Masquerades abuse 2nd effect and also can be summoned by using your opponent's stolen card as xyz material. Tearlaments Salic - A Tearalments searcher that doubles as a negate. Not better than the Tearalments' field card on your hand, but when can be good if you just need a discard or you can't find other ways for using Foolish Burial Goods Toy parade - Can be searched out after using Edge Imp Chain as a discard for Dark World Ascension, and used it on the 3200 Atk Grapha Branded Banishment - A super polymerization that banishes and gives a free GY special summon. <strong>Some explanations on why some cards are not in the deck:</strong> Tearalments Shaylen - at times it can be more dead than Mercourier on your hand, but you can add if you want to Dark World Supports(Library, Genta, Gates of Dark world) - They aren't that good in a pure Dark World Deck and will just be even more useless once you start mixing archetypes. Ash/Maxx ""C""/Imperm - Unless you need them, if not, they will drag you down <strong>Other ideas</strong> Triple T/Dark Ruler no more/Forbidden Droplet - generic supports that can help solve more situations Reducing card counts to 40 plus - take out 1 Reign-beaux, Cartesia, Bigfoot, Edge Imp archetype and Shaddoll Archetype, and you should be able to reach 40ish card count Fun Ideas for Dark World - Double Resonator and Ultimatl Bishbaalkin</p>"

They are very consistent due to their 1 card combos using <strong>Dark Beckoning Beast, Piri Reis Map, or Opening of the Spirit Gates</strong>. <strong>That's 9 starters 1 card starters!</strong> Sacred Beast alone can get out of hand if you can establish a bored due to their ability to swarm the field and make big monsters for very little. Byssted are here for several reasons. For starters, they work around having Dark or Light monsters in either GY and Sacred Beasts do a great job at getting that done. Them being low levels and having <strong>0 ATK/DEF</strong> means that even in the worst situations, you can Normal Summon one, make <strong>Almiraj</strong> or <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> and then banish the Sacred Beast for a Byssted monster. Byssted also act as D.D. Crows when your opponent controls a monster which gives Sacred Beasts needed interruption vs most decks. All Byssted monsters are 2500 ATK meaning at the very least, they act as pretty strong beatsticks with a chance to disrupt your opponent or stall out. Sacred Beasts have more synergy outside of just being fodder for Byssted. They can also bring back their continuous spell, <strong>Rebranded </strong>with <strong>Opening of the Spirit Gates</strong>. They can also bring back their continuous trap, <strong>Branded Beast</strong> if we choose to <strong>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts</strong>. Sacred Beasts also have banish effects and since we run 1 of the 2 that do use banish effects, we can make great use out of Rebranded for recycling and getting us a draw. Rebranded even lets us recycle our Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder by banishing it with a Byssted effect and then returning it to the deck to be searched later by any of our searchers.  <span>Why so many hand traps?</span>  You may be asking yourself at this point, ""<em>why are there 15 hand traps,</em> isn't that bricky?"" Well, yes and no. This deck looks to go second but can go first due to needing only 1 card to get the bare minimum started. Going second with this many hand traps means that 8/10, you will either completely stop your opponent in their tracks with how many ways you can screw them or severely limit what they can do and all you need is 1 card to get started.  <span>Goals of this deck.</span> <ul>  	<li>Be fun</li>  	<li>Be consistent</li>  	<li>Be flexible</li>  	<li>Include a Sacred Beast along with their specific support card</li>  	<li>Be competent to some extent</li> </ul> <span>Hands you are looking for ranging from best to worst case!</span>  1 Hand Trap + The Byssted Lubellion + any 2 of the combination of Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates or 1 of the previous searchers + Chaos Summoning Beast/Dark Summoning Beast + Cerulean Skyfire  3 Hand Traps + The Byssted Lubellion + Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates  3 Hand Traps + A Byssted Monster + Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates  4 Hand Traps + Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates  4 Hand Traps + The Byssted Lubellion  4 Hand Traps + A Byssted Monster  5 Hand Traps  No Hand Traps, No Starters, No Byssted Monsters  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/wwCNuME""><span>Combos!</span></a>  <span>Cards we don't run and why...</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>The Byssted Alba Los</strong> - It is a hard minus for an OK reward. Being able to basically screw over Rituals and all Extra Deck monsters besides Pendulums is pretty cool but we do not run a big enough Byssted package for it and most times, it is either a brick or seen too late. Even with all the draw power we can generate.</li>  	<li><strong>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts</strong> - While it does help us get back our 1 Branded Beast if it gets popped, it just doesn't do enough for us. The Skill Drain effect is really good but hard to achieve and requires us to run bricks to do so. In most cases, we can make enough negates and have enough hand traps that we don't need this card. The heal effect is also quite nice but can be anti-synergistic for our Map&gt;Heatsoul route in rare cases.</li>  	<li><strong>Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</strong> - This guy is pretty cool but has several reasons why Hamon was picked over him. First off, he requires 3 Fiend Monsters unlike Hamon, which requires 3 Continuous Spell Cards or just any Face-Down Spell Cards if you control Cerulean Skyfire which means you have a much higher chance of getting him out. There is a combo that you can do that uses News Reporter from the Underworld to have 3 Fiends but even then its not worth it because of the next reason. Raviel's specialty card, Raviel, Lord of Phantasms - Shimmering Scraper has more looser summoning conditions, requiring only 3 Monsters instead of Fiend Monsters but even then, it doesn't act as the original Raviel. It's effect can allow up to OTK with Raviel and it's revival effect is great for triggering Byssted Druidwurm or Saronir similar to the original Raviel's effect. Hamon's specialty card is a spell/trap negate that can stop cards like Super-Poly [the bane of this deck's existence] and Forbidden Droplet due to it being a continuous effect and a spell card instead of a monster. It is also a continuous spell so it can discarded by Opening of the Spirit Gates and added back so long as you have a level 10 monster on the field meaning you get a free summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</strong> - Weakest of the 3 Sacred Beasts. Even it's specialty card, Hyper Blaze is subpar at best due to it simply being an ATK booster for each Face-Up trap on your field or your GY. The destruction effect of Uria is also quite dated, only being able to target SET spell/trap cards but at least your opponent cannot respond to it. Overall, its almost never worth going this card unless you are running a trap variant and even then, I would consider other options.</li> </ul>"

The theory behind this deck was a simple one. I really enjoyed Prank-Kids and was sad to see Cat go. Unfortunately, now the biggest issue is getting the engine going, which is why the Invoked engine makes it even better.  The deck now has 5 searchable poly methods, a combo I was doing was Invocation two Prank-Kids (Rocksies was an MVP) and banish Aleister with the Rocksies, then Invo effect grab back your Aleister and then proceed to combo.  I came up against meta decks such as Punk Synchro, Adventure, etc and the deck performed well. A lot of meta decks cannot function after a full board wipe this format.  The side deck was a choice for my locals and did well, as I cannot take advantage on too many handtraps, I dedicated the deck to going first (hopefully) and setting up my board and then siding for the next games. I put DPE in as it is a draw 2, a free summon off dasher for your Prank Kids and DPE is still a strong card.  I was ended games with Mechaba, Toad, DPE with full Battle Butler and follow up."

I personally think the deck is pretty good as is, but there are some changes you can make depending on preference. There are some weird ratios in the deck for some things but i’ll go over everything in this deck explanation. If something abt the card ratios/uses doesn't make sense, read the combo and it might help! We dragon players need to keep this format alive, it shouldn’t just be a boring tear and splight meta. Dragons best deck!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 Abs - used to mill off of ravine to search in combo, extender if drawn and can also just be discarded to use effect and ravine can mill destrudo </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 destrudo - amazing extender, and it’s a tuner for halq plays potentially </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 white - free 2 bodies w/black and w/o normal summoning, and can be hit off of ruler since it’s light and chaos space can easily search, easily one of the best cards in the deck</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 black - same as white, just isn't as good when you draw because you need to banish a light from gy, which is very possible but not as easy/flexible as white in some scenarios </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 illusion - can search souls and can be searched off of chaos space or hit off of ruler </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 souls - can be searched off of illusion or ruler, no need for any more than 1-1 ratio, it’s only really good if the brave engine is active </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 snow - mill of of riser, amazing card and great when drawn as well since riser can mill temple for follow up and you have an extra extender + free discard </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 ze amin - to summon off of e-tele, card’s crazy - even if you draw it it’s good except you can’t use brave that turn</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 foxy tune - you search off of amin and discard self + blank to summon deer note and go into ruler early, if you draw, it’s a free summon and a discard at worst</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 deer note - for punk combo, not a good draw, but if you draw with e-tele, you can do the e-tele summon amin, amin search foxy and then deer note discard foxy to summon itself and in this case it’s the same as not opening deer note and using foxy effect normally (same number of cards used in hand)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 ghost ogre - extra card to summon off of e-tele (playing this since it’s level 3), it’s a handtrap when draw and not maximizing on it this format because there’s better handtraps to run imo</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 red rose - main halq target, cards crazy with brave or any level 4 non tuner</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 rox rose - target for red rose effect, if drawn it’s a “dragon starter” aka way to get to romulus. You can also discard it and summon it off of pisty later to use its effect. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 temple - searches brave engine and a free body if you already have access to the brave engine, it’s follow up when in the grave and it’s nice that you can use effect from grave as well since you may mill it using ruler </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 gryphon - you need this for the brave engine, helps you go nibiru proof and it’s a level 7 that can be used in the combo along with red rose to summon out fleur. Not a brick if you draw it, if you have brave engine already, you can search temple with fateful and you have a free body + follow up, and if you draw without rite, it’s still a free body and it can also be used to summon romulus since it’s a winged beast (a lot of ppl usually forget this, but romulus can take dragons and/or winged beast monsters as materials!!)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2 tracer - best rokket in the deck, summons from deck and helps you use snow effect twice during opponent's turn. Great draw, since it’s a tuner and helps extend combo if drawn as well since you usually need to search this</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 synchron - nice in the late game as a normal summon, otherwise it’s there for hot red plays</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 recharger - best level 4 rokket, pairs nicely with striker dragon, being able to bring back any dark from grave is powerful in the late game, especially when your opponent breaks your board</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 ash blossom - most generic handtrap that’s always good (and it’s a level 3 tuner, which just works in this deck)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 nibiru - it’s a light and a really high impact handtrap that is especially good this format with all the combo decks</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 gamma - if you resolve this card in your turn, you pretty much win the duel, -1 from opponents hand (the ash they used that’s negated), free ruler, which means free mill 4 and add 1, and ruler can bring itself back from graveyard as well. If you resolve this card, you're at such an advantage you almost always just win, unless your opponent opens crazy. Can protect when you use : chaos space, e-tele, quick launch and temple</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 driver - best card in the entire deck, what else can I say?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 galaxy cyclone - this is kinda weird, but i lose 2-1 to mystic mine decks so much this format, so i feel like it’s worth maining this just so you don't auto lose this matchup if dracoback has already been used. Playing this specifically because it’s nice when you mill it off of ruler and use it rather than having harpie’s in the main deck and praying you draw it. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 rite - amazing starter and works wonders with the red rose engine </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 fateful - not amazing when you draw this, but it’s not half bad. When you open with rite, it’s a -1, not the end of the world, but if you open it normally, you can search temple and get token + dracoback which isn't half bad. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 dracoback - this card’s crazy going second and it’s a free discard going first, main deck out to mine as well, not a great draw most of the time</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 e-tele - it’s a free ruler + halq when you summon ze-amin, and helps dig for the brave engine when you don't open it and extends the combo (since you don't need to use tracer + recharger to go into ruler, you can go straight for savage and potentially end on an extra hot red). When you already used ze-amin or you draw it in the late game, it can summon gamma as a body/tuner or ghost ogre as a level 3 tuner (this is important in this deck)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 quick launch - it’s a free dragon, rokket synchron, level 4 body, tuner or tracer: whichever you want it to be at that moment </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 chaos space - this card’s crazy, gives a ton of card advantage and is just value in general. It gets you 2 free summons, recycles striker, and draws you a card, what more can you ask for? Can also search illusion by discarding a light (:</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 boot: for combo, not a great draw, you just won't search it </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 ravine: for combo, again, you will search so not the best draw, but at least it does something when you draw it unlike cough cough boot cough cough</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 foolish - this card is whatever you want it to be, brave engine, tracer (via abs), tuner (destrudo) or even snow </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 basal rose shoot: another combo card, not the best draw by interesting thing is, when you search it off of rox, you can set it instead of using it and it helps you play around dark ruler (dark ruler c1, basal c2, hot red c3 on dark ruler)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Main combo (a way to make halq + brave engine) - </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Note</span><span>: I’ll be using souls + ash blossom + rite but it can literally be anything else here. Having souls is kind of a bonus, it can be any random monster in it’s place </span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use rite, summon token grab fateful</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Normal ash, fateful grab draco</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Fateful eff, search gryphon and then disc draco</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Draco equip onto token</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Gryphon summon itself out (make sure you use the rightmost 2 zones or leftmost 2 zones, just to be safe, don't play the brave stuff in the middle zones so you have guardragon plays if halq gets negated)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Souls dump illusion, to summon itself</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Souls send fateful and draco to draw 2, free cash money</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Souls + ash into halq, summon red rose </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Red rose + gryphon into fleur (dont summon in the middle, stick to one side)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Red rose summon rox rose</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Rox rose grab basal</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Rox + token into riser, use eff to dump snow</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Riser into striker (right arrow of halq, also riser is level 3 now so this is legal), grab boot</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Basal summon red rose, red rose into pisty (left halq arrow)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Pisty bring back something</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Pisty + something into romulus, grab ravine</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ravine discard mill abs search tracer</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Boot summon tracer</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Tracer pop boot summon recharger</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Tracer + recharger into ruler, mill and add</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Romulus + halq + ruler into borrend (summon into zone striker points to instead of extra monster zone, we do this so when we summon unicorn into extra monster zone in opponents turn, we get an extra draw since it’s co linked to borrelend!)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Striker destroy itself, add recharger, recharger effect, summon itself back</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Borrelend target recharger and summon back tracer from gy</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Tracer + recharger into savage, eff to equip halq</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Now if you have an extender in hand, you can make I:P (if it’s just any random body this works) or hot red (if you have quick launch) since you have ruler in grave as the second body for these effects</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Opponents turn, we have borrelend (negate and summon back tracer), fleur (omni negate), savage (omni negate), snow set x2 (summon, then tracer eff to pop it and then snow again - can’t use if you already used synchron w/quick launch tho!) and potentially a handtrap you hit off of ruler effect. Make sure to always banish striker from gy (with ruler, snow or the chaos dragons) to recycle with chaos space for follow up! This is the basic gist of it, ending on multiple negates and amazing follow up with flexible combo pieces. </span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>Nibiru</span><span>: In this combo, you are immune to nib the entire time, having gryphon or bleur on board at all times. If your opponent has nib, they will use it to force out the gryphon negate (the ideal time is when there’s halq, red rose, gryphon and token on board, if they let you resolve red rose, there’s no point in dropping nib, because it trades with fluer, which till stays on board and can do stuff next turn and lets red rose resolve which is too much card advantage). If they do this, you still do the same combo, except you don't have gryphon, which means no fleur in the end board (oh no! One negate’s gone!). When you don't have brave engine, you can do the same combo here, except pretend the brave token is a level 4 body (literally anything from chaos dragons to snow to recharger that you summoned with quick launch) and do the combo normally. You just won't have fleur in the end board. Be mindful though! Dont just fullsend your resources in this combo right away and get punished by nib, because you are not protected here. You can do this after you made riser and used red rose effect though, because your opponent would have dropped nib by now if they had it. The nib proof version and this version lose to impem/veiler + nib though so that's something to keep in mind. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Punk Stuff (most ppl alr know how this engine works but i’ll explain anyways)</span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>E-tele out ze-amin</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Amin search foxy</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Foxy discard itself and blank to summon deer note</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Synchro into ruler, deer note bring back ze-amin</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Mill 5 add 1</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ruler + amin into halq</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>This engine helps extend the regular combo and helps you dig for temple/brave engine. In the main combo, if you opened this instead of the souls + normal summon, you can go directly into savage instead of ruler, then you can summon out I:P as well, so this helps extend the combo. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Extra dec</span><span>k: Most of the stuff in extra is used in combo, except for dharc, triple burst and accesscode. The only reason I don't play seal is because it doesn't come up as often as dharc or triple burst. Triple burst is amazing when you don't have striker + pisty to make guardragon plays. It comes up a LOT and some people are using it instead of hot red in the extra. I was doing this as well, but I feel like hot red is necessary for this meta with all the mystic mine and spell stuff going around. Dharc also does come up going second and I just found myself using it more than seal. In the end, it’s based on preference, you can pick 3 out of these 4, dharc, seal, triple burst and hot red. If I had a 16 card extra, i’d definitely play all of them, but in the end there is no wrong answer as to what you pick, I’ve seen ppl run all combinations of those cards. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Changes I’d make</span><span>: if you are a normal human being (couldn't be me haha) you’d play 51 cards with 3 droplet instead of the galaxy and ogre</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Well, thats basically all I have to say, if there are any questions lmk in the comments, I’ll try to answer them asap (been kinda busy lately tho so idk). Send mea friend request on disc with any questions (Ash_001#9275). Anyways thanks for reading if your still here lol this took quite a bit to type out. </span>"

You can also run pot of prosperity if you so desire however that is a very expensive card and it increases the deck size so it'll be harder to open a good hand. P.S this deck is for fun only it is not for really competitive play.

My best end was Cicada King, Apollousa and Atlas which is pretty good for this deck.  Also, it's fine if you draw Mantis which is hillarious since you will mostly  equip it with Picofalena.  Deck is fine and it's best Insect deck out there. It is Rogue and can fight the best decks and come out victorious."

I like Danger! Dark World decks as much as the next person, but I also like to have a field spell that actually works when I send a Danger! monster to the graveyard as well. This deck is by no means perfect. I'm still trying to get use to making decks with newer cards (in other words I'm only really good at making decks from the GX era).

There are multiple engines / packages running in the main deck that all contribute to each-other including The Magicians', Palladium, and Timaeus The United Dragon Package; The Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package; The Kuriboh Brothers Package;  The Red-Eyes Package; The Blue-Eyes Package; and The Legendary Dragons Package. (Disclaimer: Many staples were left out to focus on cards that can contribute to each-others' engines').  The deck tends to run on its own depending on opening hand. Ideally the Kuriboh Brothers are used as the main line of Defense while the Magician/Dragon Knight board gets built though any of the other engines can pick up steam quickly largely due to how light they are. The Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package is a very light and versatile package that continually recycles itself back into the deck and synergies with any discard cost in addition to providing material for Dark Cavalry, Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and for either Jack's Knight or Joker's Knight to be used as tribute for Five Star Twilight. The Red-Eyes Package stands on its own with Red-Eyes Fusion to go into Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon while Red-Eyes Baby Dragon helps serve as a bridge to either access the Black Stone of Legend OR The White Stone of Ancients (When making Red-Eyes Slash Dragon with Red-Eyes Fusion ideally it is best to use Joker's Knight as the Warrior material to set up a possible bounce back to the hand once another Light Warrior hits the graveyard. All Warrior monsters in the main deck are Light Warrior monsters). The Blue-Eyes Package is also a very light package (2 card package) that helps serve as material for any of the Dragon Knight fusion forms on top of being able to make Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon (All Dragons in the deck also increase the probability of making a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword through The Claw of Hermos).  Lastly, The Legendary Dragon's Package consists of all three Legendary Dragon spells (The Claw of Hermos, the Eyes of Timaeus, and the Fang of Critias) running in the main deck as optimized as possible. The main deck runs 10 Spellcaster monsters, 7 Dragon monsters, and 6 Warrior monsters (All are targets for the Claw of Hermos to build either a Time Magic Hammer, a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword, a Goddess Bow, or a Rocket Hermos. Time Magic Hammer and Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword possibly being the best 2 of the 4.) Though The Eye of Timaeus only has 2 targets in the whole deck (Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl) to make either of the Dragon Knight forms or Amulet Dragon, it has heavy synergy with most of the Dark Magician archetype in being searchable and in also being a target for Timaeus the United Dragon to be special summoned from hand.  Mirror Force, Crush Card Virus, Ring of Destruction and Tyrant Wing are all main decked for The Fang of Critias  and all of these Trap cards serve a double purpose in helping disrupt through their Trap Card activation OR by going into they Dragon Fusion forms. (Mirror Force is self explanatory, Crush Card Virus has a total of 11 targets that meet its activation requirements in the main deck, Ring of Destruction can easily disrupt an opponent's turn and Tyrant Wing has a total of 7 Dragon targets in the main deck (In addition to any of the other Dragons in the Extra Deck).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Deck Breakdown:  &nbsp;  The Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package: Joker's Knight package with King's, Queen's and Jack's Knight along with Joker's Straight and Imperial Bower. Both Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight during the End Phase can recur back to hand from the graveyard by returning 1 Light Warrior monster from the Graveyard into the deck. (Any Warrior from main deck can be returned from the graveyard into the deck to meet Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight recurring effect  because they are all Light Warrior's INCLUDING any of the Legendary Knights.)  Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear was recently added to contribute to the Joker's Package AND to also help Search Red-Eyes B. Dragon. (Giltia can also be used as tribute for Five Star Twilight along with Joker's Knight and Jack's Knight and can also be used for a Fusion summon fro Dark Cavalry and/or Red-Eyes Slash Dragon).  &nbsp;  Kuriboh Brothers Package: (Kuriboh Brothers including Kuribabylon with Five Star Twilight, Kuribohrn, Kuribandit, Magikuriboh, Skilled Brown Magician, Multiply, Detonate, and the Flue of Summoning Kuriboh). The Kuriboh's help search each other (Kuribahs' and Kuriboos' effect) along with helping search their own Spells/Traps (Kuribees' effect). Kuribandit, Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriborhn and Magikuriboh can all be brought out from the deck in several ways to assist in the duel  (Both Magikuriboh and Kuriborhn can be searched by Kuriboo's effect and be brought to hand and Kuribah's effect grants a special summon of any monster with 300ATK/200DEF onto the field after it or another Kuriboh monster on the field is destroyed by battle; All Kuriboh monsters in the deck are 300ATK/200DEF including Kuribohrn, Magikuriboh and Skilled Brown Magician). Kuribee's effect helps search any Spell/Trap with Kuriboh in its text (Five Star Twilight, Mulitply, The Flute oF Summoning Kuriboh, and Detonate are all searchable through Kuribee). Skilled Brown Magician serves multiple functions such as supporting the Kuriboh Brothers engine to even fusing with Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl into The Dark Magicians. Can also be used to make a Time Magic Hammer). Kuribandit is a VERY underestimated card. Kuribandit when normal summoned can be used as tribute during the End Phase to search the top 5 cards of the deck and add 1 Spell/Trap to the hand and send the remaining 4 to the graveyard. (Kuribandit works very well with Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight and adds any excavated Spell/Trap to the hand). Any of the DARK Kuribohs can also be used as tribute for Deck Devastation Virus.  &nbsp;  The Magicians, Palladiums, and Timaeus the United Dragon: Both Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are the main Fusion targets of the deck (Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are mainly to be used to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms. Magicians' Souls may just be the easiest way to bring either Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl out of the deck yet Palladium Oracle Mana and Palladium Oracle Mahad both provide another route to bring Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl onto the field. Apprentice Illusion Magician adds another way to search Dark Magician and be added to hand. Magician's Salvation helps bring search and set Eternal Soul onto the field at a faster rate. Magikuriboh can be searched and brought out to either the hand or field through Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriboo, and Kuribah (After battle or effect damage Makgikuriboh's hand effect can be triggered to bring out Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl from either deck or graveyard and can be recycled from graveyard back to hand whenever a face-up Spellcaster you control is destroyed by battle or card effect. Timaeus the United Dragon can be special summoned from the hand by sending any Spell/Trap that mentions ""Dark Magician"" (A vast majority of Spells in the deck mention Dark Magician) is there to help get into any of the the Dragon Knight fusion forms through contact fusion.  &nbsp;  The Red-Eyes Package: As long as Red-Eyes Fusion stays at least at 1 in the TCG the Red-Eyes Package provides a-lot of synergy to this deck. The Black Stone of Legend can be used to summon out Red Eye B. Dragon but most importantly it can be used to push Red-Eyes B. Dragon from the graveyard back into the deck to avoid Red-Eyes Fusion becoming a brick. Red-Eyes Fusion has two targets in the extra deck (Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). If Red-Eyes Fusion is used to make Red-Eyes Slash Dragon ideally it is best to use Joker's Knight as the warrior fusion material because Joker's Knight can then be bounced back from the graveyard into the hand if there are any Light Warrior targets in the graveyard to recur Joker's Knight back to the hand. Red-Eyes Fusion can also be used to bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon (the most abused path in making Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). Any of the Red-Eyes monsters also serve as additional targets for the Magicians to go into Dragon Knight fusion forms in addition to there being more targets for the Claw of Hermos to make a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword.  &nbsp;  Keeper of Dragon Magic: Keeper of Dragon Magic adds any ""Fusion"" normal spell ""or ""Polymerization"" from deck to hand (targets are Red-Eyes Fusion or Fusion Deployment) and helps add ways to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms OR Red-Eyes Slash Dragon or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon AND can help bring back either Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, Red-Eyes B. Dragon, or Blue-Eyes White Dragon if any of them are in the graveyard as long as one of their fusion forms that lists one of them is in the Extra Deck when Keeper is normal/special summoned. Keeper of Dragon Magic also serves as another fusion target for any of the Dragon Knight fusion forms and Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon.  &nbsp;  Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear - Giltia is an easy last resort normal summon that can clear the field of a tank by banishing it through its normal summon effect. Since Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear is a Light Warrior, Giltia also meets both Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight bounce back-to-hand effects if either of them are in the graveyard. Giltia the D. Knight Soul Spear's effect also allows it to discard a card to be able to search a level 7 Dark Dragon Monster in deck to add to hand (Red-Eyes B. Dragon) and can also be used as fusion material to summon Red-Eyes Slash Dragon.  &nbsp;  Draw Power: Dark Magician Circle and Soul Servant serve as the main search/draw power cards of the deck. Even when Dark Magical Circle does not add a card to hand it helps set up a card for the next draw. Soul Servant at Max power can draw 4 cards and helps search nearly all of the cards in the Magicians' package including any of the Spellcasters (with exception to Skilled Brown Magician) inclusively Timaeus The United Dragon can be searched by Soul Servant as well.  Eternal Soul also helps thin the deck by searching out ""Dark Magic Attack"" and ""Thousand Knives"".  &nbsp;  The Legendary Dragons Package: Mirror Force, Ring of Destruction, Crush Card Virus and Tyrant Wing are strong disruption cards with a slight exception of Tyrant Wing. These Trap cards all serve a double purpose in helping disrupt through their Trap Card activation OR by going into they Dragon Fusion forms being Mirror Force Dragon, Destruction Dragon, Doom Virus Dragon and Tyrant Dragon by using The Fang of Critias. The Claw of Hermos serves like an equip spell toolbox depending on what Type of monster is used to make either Goddess Bow, Time Magic Hammer, Rocket Hermos Cannon, or Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword. The Eye of Timaeus helps The Magicians' Package in going into a Dragon Knight fusion form AND also increases Spell card targets for Timaeus the United Dragon to be special summoned.  &nbsp;  Fusion Deployment: Very simple yet very powerful card for any deck that focuses solely on a Fusion based extra deck. Fusion Deployment can be used to special summon Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, Red-Eyes B. Dragon, or Blue-Eyes White Dragon from the hand or deck since there are various targets in the Extra Deck that list them as fusion material.  &nbsp;  Polymerization - Allows a Fusion summon by using monsters from hand or field as fusion material. Adds additional ways to go into most of the Fusion Monsters in the Extra Deck in addition to Red-Eyes Fusion, Secrets of Dark Magic, Timaeus the United Dragon, and the Eye of Timaeus.  &nbsp;  Harpie's Feather Duster: The cream of the crop of staples. Destroys all spells and traps your opponent controls.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Side deck can easily be any other cards though I find that Spiritual Swords of Revealing Light, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning and surprisingly Berserker Soul can also be main decked without them diluting much of the synergy already going on in the main deck.  &nbsp;  Thank you for the interest! Please feel free to leave feedback!"

Cheers  -Exo  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/aSnTeZ_TZPk"">https://youtu.be/aSnTeZ_TZPk</a> )  &nbsp;  A dark age in Yu-Gi-Oh is coming as me and most of the playerbase has already known it. One way or another, the inevitable demise of the what was supposed to be a slow but smooth recovery turned into yet another avalanche of unexplained proportions. The existence of the newly created Spright archetype can easily create boards that don't have to rely on any special mechanics or anything unique or beyond the grand-scheme, such as its previous meta contenders that came before it and now. To that being said, the TCG variant is lucky enough to not really be as ""Tier 0"" as the OCG variants has made it out to be. However only time would tell if this is the came for where, and how Splight (Spright) truly stands as a competitive deck.  &nbsp;  For one reason I can say that this deck is an immediate success upon the release of POTE comes from how it can quickly (and fluently) build boards, set up a defensive wall for negations, and piece together an OTK versus other decks. However it doesn't mean that it isn't vulnerable to cards like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a>, and <a data-name=""PSY-FrameGear Gamma"">PSY-FrameGear Gamma</a>; but we in the TCG are also in the position to use a very particular card that was obscure for awhile, known as <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator </a>(basically <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>, but you banish any card from your deck for said card to be negated instead of the GY). Before I go on to the XYZ monsters, there is a new Link-2 monster I have yet to mention in the Spright archetype that contributes the most to the board building and playing extensions: <a data-name=""Spright Elf"">Spright Elf</a> is a Link-2 monster that can special summon a Level 2 monster from your GY (or a Rank/Link-2 monster from your GY if your opponent controls a monster). Hence why <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax </a>was chosen here because of not only of the Synergy with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerina"">I:P Masquerina</a>; but also because it doesn't require <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> to banish important Link-2 monsters (like <a data-name=""Spright Elf"">Spright Elf</a>) to activate effects. Which in my opinion is a lot more resourceful for both sides than just banishing a link monster and trying to pop a card (on 4300 ATK) just to have it negated with any on field negate (or having your efforts decimated all together with <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> if you didn't use<a data-name=""I:P Masquerina""> I:P Masquerina</a>).  &nbsp;  Finally the XYZ monsters that contributed on building the defensive structure that was necessary to further build boards and chip away at your opponents with less setbacks. While it may not come as a surprise to those who play Water base decks that take advantage of the familar XYZ monster, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>; <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> is a Rank-2 Monster that negates anything by tributing a ""Frog"" monster (including itself), and recycles itself to be used later. The newest XYZ Monster, <a data-name=""Gigantic Spright"">Gigantic Spright</a>can be not only be XYZ summoned with using a Link-2 monster as well; but in doing so can get a multiplier in its base attack stat. For its features, <a data-name=""Gigantic Spright"">Gigantic Spright</a> can detach one XYZ material to special summon a Level 2 monster from the deck; but in doing so you can not Special Summon for the rest of the turn, except the aforementioned Level/Rank/Link-2 monsters (including your opponent). Finally comes <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin"">The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin</a>, which is just infinite impermanence in form of a monster card; but could be a quick effect if I was able to put a Phantom Knights piece in here (however I would not recommend this for sanity sake).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

That's basically it, let's take advantage of Necrovalley being a pushed floodgate with lots of support, let's put up Gryphon Rider as often as possible, and lets see 2 HT as often as possible to really try and stop people's turns.

Some of these are good tuners that can help you put pressure on the board, but our real goal is just to not lost turn 1. I also wanted a full playset of Cosmic Cyclone.  After that, you want to see exactly 1 copy of Necrovalley, and you can run 5, so I'm running 5. Not much to say, this shuts down a lot of starters, extenders, and combo lines. We're just trying to floodgate people out with this card. It does conflict with Foolish Burial and Dracoback, so you can't mitigate the downside of Adventure as often on turn 2, and you need to know how to sequence Necrovalley, but even most idiots should be able to figure it out T1. It hurts almost every other deck more than ours anyways.  After that, you want all 5 of your Adventurer engine starters, but you also want 2 Adventure and 2 Gryphon Rider. Seeing these together puts up Grypon Rider, but mostly we're just running these so we aren't out of gas vs a single Cosmic or Ghost Ogre.  That left 5 slots. I felt like Called By was just too good to pass up in the deck, the card is very strong and close to an autoinclude. I also felt like raw card advantage would be pretty important for a stally stunny deck like this, and it really needs to see the Adventurer engine sooner rather than later. It also doesn't use the Extra Deck, so Pot of Extravagence makes sense.  The extra deck are mostly cards to make with your tuners, as well as cards to send vs Dogmatika Maximus. You should dip into this very often, but Baronne/Chengying is great to make with an unused Ash and Gryphon, and Omega/Draco Berserker is good to make with Gamma."
