This Deck can easily setup 2 Dark Law and with either letting your opponent search once or Summon Destiny HERO Drawhand to force your opponent to add a card and Locking them out with Droll.

I toped the remote duel invite with a similar build and just won a win a mat with this most recent build this weekend at the extrva (1/21/21). Main idea behind the deck is the get a barrier statue out under simorgh with drident + back row and or hand traps. If you can blow up their normal summon you can normally otk or make a big push in turn 3.

The Cipher Deck revolves around summoning the Xyz Monster Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon as soon as possible, then to use that card and others in order to win. The Deck isn't as close in power to its original archetype, but it still is a fun deck to play with.</span>

<span><strong>HIGHLIGHTS:</strong></span>

<span><strong>Cipher Twin Raptor, Cipher Wing, Cipher Mirror Knight:</strong> All 3 work great with the Deck. Twin Raptor can call out another Cipher from the deck, Wing can easily summon itself if you control a Cipher monster (also is not once per turn), and Mirror Knight can revive a Cipher destroyed in battle, as well as being able to search a Cipher from the Deck.</span>

<strong>Galaxy Queen's Light: </strong>Also a great card for the Deck. It helps give the deck another way to make their Xyz without being super-reliant on Cipher Wing. Works well with <strong>B.E.S. Big Core MK-8 </strong>and <strong>Guardian of Order</strong>.

<strong>Photon Lead: </strong>Additional summon for LIGHT monsters, which is also good since this deck mostly has LIGHT monsters.

<b>Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Ascension: </b>Wasn't able to use the card a lot, but is still fun to keep in the deck.

<span><strong>EXTRA DECK:</strong></span>

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon: </strong>The deck's go-to Xyz Monster. Can steal a monster you opponent controls. Can help get rid of troubling monsters and can make use of stolen monsters.

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon: </strong>Ace card. Can destroy a card on the field, as well as reviving a <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon </strong>when destroyed.

<strong>Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon: </strong>Pretty much <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong> but can steal up to 3 of your opponent's monsters. Will require the Rank-Up in order to summon.

<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Ex Dragon: </strong>A nice addition to the deck. Can protect your LIGHT monsters from being targeted by card effects, as well as reviving a Cipher Dragon that is in the graveyard during your Standby Phase.

The rest of the Extra Deck are extra options for the deck. Enjoy! :)"

The deck is focused on summoning the lvl 8 myutant monsters onto the field and later banishing/shuffling them back for cost of fusion summoning the big myutant monsters. if you do not open myutants you can floodgate your opponent or use dogma to slow your opponents down.
<ul>
 	<li>the myutant strain
<ul>
 	<li>the main play with myutant monsters is to summon ST-46 with M-05 in your hand, search a spell(field spell or another fusion card), use effect of ST-46 to tribute and banish the m-05 in your hand, special summoning a <a data-name=""M&lt;a data-name=&quot;myutant beast&quot;&gt;yutant beast&lt;/a&gt;"">M</a><a data-name=""myutant beast"">yutant beast</a>.</li>
 	<li>then use the field spell to S.S the m-05 to get another search(myutant monster)</li>
 	<li>set backrow (if you already have field spell you can search myutant cry for a fusion summon on your opponent turn)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>the defects
<ul>
 	<li>since this deck uses trap trick and is more trap focused, royal decree and jinzo really stop this deck from fusion summoning or using a floodgate</li>
 	<li>The barrier statues really stop this deck cold in it's tracks as it is needed to special summon the big myutants in order to do something. infinite impermanence helps with this only for a little bit but you have to waste a battle phase to get rid of it. or use dragma punishment to get rid of it and make plays next turn.</li>
 	<li>no spell and trap removal other than Myutant Synthesis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Here is one of the main strategys. 1-have( using alpha, zeta,diviner and some luck) slayer, battlelord, evolution/charge and origin. sounds dificult, but thanks to drytrons  is not so much.

use evolution, send a vendread battlelord from your deck to the GY, special summon  battlelord from your hand, and use his effect, banishing evolution, to protect your monsters of handtraps. Use origin to special summon slayer, by banishing battlelord from your GY. Now, make avendread savior with slayer and battlelord.  the effects of battlelord and slayer will trigger, and you can add a origin and a slayer from your deck to your hand, also send executor and anima from your deck to the GY. Now activate savior, and recover your origin, and activate origin by banishing executor from your GY, special summon slayer. Now activate origin, banish battlelord to special summon slayer. Now you have two slayers, and savior,infinite possibilities with beatrice and drytrons. But here is the basic to do with this board. Make apollousa and use the effect of anima to special summon the banished executor. (Apollousa with 3 materials+ Executor) remembering: this is the board without drytrons in your field. with these guys in the field, you can increment this board a lot. I will not explain everything that this deck can do, but is a great deck.

Thanks to reading this until the end ^^

The strategy here is to burn your entire deck to the GY to get at least 3 cards. The way you burn cards is similar to a Exodia deck but it's really not

I basically copied this deck from someone I played against a match online in Dueling Nexus, so this isnt my idea. I swapped cards out and made a few edits to try make less bricks happen.

You want at least 2 copies of <a data-name=""Blasting the Ruins"">Blasting the Ruins</a>, and <a data-name=""Magical Explosion"">Magical Explosion</a>.

The way to activate <a data-name=""Blasting the Ruins"">Blasting the Ruins</a> is to have 30 cards (at all) in your GY and if you do, you can deal 3000 damage to your opponent.

<a data-name=""Magical Explosion"">Magical Explosion</a>, is limited to one probably because of how broken it is when you play these kind of decks. It deals 200 damage for EACH spell card in your GY. So playing this when you have around 30 spell cards in your GY is really broken.

And that's it. The deck obviously comes with bricks and can be hit hard with negations but if that don't happen, you are all set."

&nbsp;

First Way:

1: Have any monster in the graveyard to special summon ""Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord"".

2: Use ""Advanced Ritual Art"" and dump level 1 monsters while summoning ""Demis, King of Armageddon"". (Demis can be replaced with other ritual monsters)

3: ""Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord"" gains 8000 atk!

&nbsp;

Second Way (Starting from the stage 1 of the first way, currently with ""Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord"" on field):

1: Use ""Ojama Trio (Or any other effects that place weak monsters on enemy's field) to summon 3 Ojama tokens on enemy's field

2: Use ""Diffusion Wave-Motion"" to allow ""Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord"" to attack all the tokens and monsters.

If Ultimate Dragon is destroyed, there are some cards for backup support to get the materials back like the Pot Of Avarice. Also, I stuffed some useless cards in the Extra Deck for banishing for Pot Of Extravagance. I put some strong attack forces and tribute slaves for drawing out the game to get the correct cards like Fusion Gate, which allows you to fuse without Polymerization and Pot Of Acquisitiveness gets the banished cards back and even gives you a card as well! Also, i included Mirror Force Dragon because its effect can defend all of the controlled cards, including itself!

The philosophy with this deck is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's unparalleled grind game.

<span>The deck features 4 card types in the maindeck:</span>

<span><strong><em>10 board ""equalizers""</em> </strong></span>

<em>3 Lightning Storm</em> - The most expensive card in the deck (About $100 each as of this writing) it is incredibly powerful. It can wipe either backrow or monsters given the player using it doesn't have face-up cards. This is useful going second, but can become a brick mid/late game. This card can be replaced by a cheaper alternative like Twin Twisters or Dark Ruler No More (still not quite the same or as powerful unfortunately, hope this card gets reprinted soon).

<em>3 Evenly Matched</em> - One of the most potent board killers out there, it's non-targeting/destroying removal can out most boards if allowed to activate. Just skip your battlephase as you go second, and watch your opponent's carefully crafted board that they've spent 10 minutes comboing for disappear into the Shadow Realm.

<em>2 Dark Hole</em> - An oldschool power card that is still super useful in a Sky Striker deck, as this deck doesn't mind it's own monsters are destroyed if there is access to Raye/Roze. This card is useful going second and even during mid-game - Clear your opponent's monsters, then summon Raye/Roze again to attack directly!

<em>1 Raigeki</em> - No explanation needed, smash your opponent's monsters!

<em>1 Feather Duster</em> - No explanation needed, obliterate your opponent's backrow! This is especially useful during this meta as it is dominated by control cards in the backrow, like Dogmatika Punishment, Ice Dragon's Prison, and Torrential Tribute.

<span><strong>8 tuner handtraps</strong></span>

The monster tuner handtrap line-up consists of <em>3 Ashblossom, 3 Ghost Ogre, and 2 Effect Veiler</em> (for the Halqifibrax/Selene/Accesscode combo). 8 of these bad girls allow for easier access to Halqifibrax, so that Accesscode can be created easily via Selene.

To those of you who do not know this combo, you just make Halqifibrax by linking away a tuner and a monster. Use Halq to summon a spellcaster tuner from your deck (effect veiler) to make Selene. Selene resurrects effect veiler from GY by spending spell 3 counters, then your link those to create your link 4 Accesscode to push for game.

These handtraps also can choke up your opponent's play during their turn, stifling/stopping crucial parts of board from developing so you can pick it apart on your turn. They can be swapped out for other handtraps to metagame your opponent's deck - just keep in mind that the more tuner monsters you swap out, the harder it is to do the Halqifibrax/Selene/Accesscode combo. (ex. Nibiru for combo-decks like Drytron, or Artifact Lancea vs. Dino)

<span><strong>15 Sky Striker Cards</strong></span>

Everyone knows what these cards do already, so I'll just explain why I picked the ratios for each card. <em>3 Raye</em> (obviously) but also <em>3 Roze</em>, just because she's just another name  that says ""Sky Striker"" so we can summon the Striker link monsters. Sometimes, not opening any of these ladies can mean the end of the game for the Striker player, because it doesn't allow the Striker to initiate a grindgame to capitalize on the lead that they made equalizing the game-state with going-second cards, thus allowing the opponent to recover. 3 <em>Airspace Area Zero</em> and 1 <em>Hornet Drones</em> are also added to allow for maximum access to the Striker links.

1 <em>Multirole</em> for resource recycling of Sky Striker Spells. Whatever you do, DO NOT let this card get banished by something like cosmic cyclone, if it does, that represents about half the grind game power of Sky Strikers down the drain. Ideally, after you equalize the gamestate in turn 2, you search this card with your first <em>Shizuku</em> at the endstep to initiate your grindgame for turn 3.

3 <em>Widow Anchor</em> is to maximize your ability for fieldwide control of your opponent's cards and to disrupt plays. I only added one <em>Shark Cannon </em>because I find that other cards are more useful. However, if you come across a deck that uses a lot of monsters in the GY (such as Eldlich) feel free to swap out other cards for Shark Cannon to control the graveyard.

1 <em>Afterburner!</em> is a only a one-of because so many other cards blow up the field in this deck anyways. If something is still alive after you obliterate the field with Lightning Storm and Dark Hole, finish em off with a classic <em>Afterburners! </em>This card can also destroy an active Area Zero if it's already on your field, giving you another Sky Striker monster on the board. Against backrow decks, feel free to swap this card out for <em>Jamming Waves!</em> to destroy their face down cards.

<span><strong>6 non-archetypal support spell cards</strong></span>

1 <em>Upstart Goblin</em> to put a free spell in your GY strengthening your Striker Link monsters as well as a relatively free +1 draw. It may give your opponent +1000 lifepoints, but arguably in most cases lifepoints don't matter if your opponent has few resources left after you whittle them down with your Sky Striker cards and board equalizers.

1 <em>Terraforming</em> to allow for easy access to Area Zero.

1 <em>Called by the Grave</em> to out those pesky ghost girl hand traps or banish that old annoying Eldlich dude being a creep in the GY.

1 <em>Reinforcement of the Army</em> to search for Sky Striker Raye to allow more consistent access to Striker link monsters.

2 <em>Pot of Avarice</em> for resource recycling, especially of your Sky Striker link monsters, especially because you burn through a lot of them. This card is a easy +2 because it's conditions of shuffling 5 monsters back into the deck from the GY is so effortless to do in Sky Strikers. Since this card's unban, I've taken out Sky Striker's own resource recycling card Hercules Base because I feel this card is superior even though it's unsearchable. Feel free to bump this card to 3, and maybe take out the Upstart Goblin. This card may be a bit bricky/sticky sometimes though, so be careful.

<span>For the <strong>Extra Deck</strong>, we have</span>

11 Sky Striker link monsters - 3 <em>Kagari</em> (spell recovery from GY), 3 <em>Hayate</em> (direct attack + dump Striker card to GY), 3 <em>Shizuku</em> (Free search and endphase), 1 <em>Kaina</em> (stop opponent's monster's attack), and 1 <em>Zeke</em> (Primarily to link away your oppenent's monster you gained control over and to banish an opponent's monster on board).

1 Hiita the Fire Charmer because it also allow access to Selene by stealing your opponent's used Ash Blossom, Almiraj or any other fire monster that is running around in the meta nowadays. Hiita is easily able to be made by first going into Kagari, the fire attribute Sky Striker and linking it away. From Selene, the player can make Accesscode for game.

3 cards for the Accesscode Talker Package - Sky Striker's win-condition nowadays is pushing aggressively for the win with Accesscode Talker by clearing your opponent's board by banishing link monsters with different attributes in your GY (which Sky Strikers easily fulfill) and attacking with 5300 for game. Accesscode is primarily made with Halqifibrax/Selene/Accesscode combo. Use Halq to summon a spellcaster tuner from your deck (effect veiler) to make Selene. Selene resurrects effect veiler from GY by spending spell 3 counters, then your link those to create your link 4 Accesscode to push for game. Be sure to first whittle down your opponent's lifepoints below 5300 and to make sure they have no more tricks in their sleeve beforehand to ensure an OTK.

<span>Additional Commentary</span>

<strong>Weaknesses -</strong> This deck is very strong, and it can consistently contend vs. the strongest decks of any era of Yugioh (so far) but it has a few weaknesses. This deck autoloses vs. anti-spell floodgates such as Secret Village of Spellcasters and Imperial Order. A deck that uses both of these cards is very difficult to beat (I'm looking at you, Altergeists &gt;:c)
Monster cards that are untargetable/undestroyable/unaffect are very difficult for this deck to get rid of as well, such as Red Eyes Dragoon, Mathmech Final Sigma and Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon. These cards are specifically why I side Lava Golem or other kaijus to use in match-ups where these cards are common.
Finally, there are some decks that actually still recover quite competently after you wipe their board and can counter-attack your fragile board with strong gigantic monsters for an OTK. Watch-out for games, and try to force a grind-game where you're several steps ahead to avoid this situation.

As a machine player that loves to play aggressively in dynamic interesting back/forth games, I absolutely LOOOOVE this deck. It's super fun wiping your opponent's carefully crafted board, then having your favourite pretty mech girl destroy monster after monster like the Doomslayer (RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE!). Hope you folks have as much fun playing this deck as I do, even though Sky Strikers technically are not meta anymore. Raye is baye! &lt;3

Requires the newly ","The main goal of this deck is to summon Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon, using Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon for at least one of its XYZ materials. During damage calculation, you can remove an XYZ material from it to increase its attack by 200 x the combined ranks of all XYZ monsters on the field. At minimum, this card will gain 1600 atk, for a total of 5600. However, if you use Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon as one of its XYZ material, and remove Afterglow for Prime Photon's effect, Afterglow's second ability will activate. You can special summon one Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon from your hand or deck to the field in attack position, and then Prime Photon's attack will double from 5600 to 11,200, which is generally enough for a OTK. However, if your opponent has any life points remaining somehow, you can attack with the special summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon for extra damage.

With the cards I've assembled for the deck, I run into very minimum bricks, and it's extremely easy to summon Galaxy Eyes Prime Photon Dragon in a single turn. To minimize bricks, I've included two copies of Foolish Burial Goods. One to remove Metalfoes Fusion from my deck to activate its effect to draw 1 card, or to send Return of the Dragon Lords to the GY in case you need protection for your dragons. However, outside 3x Photon Sanctuary, 3x Galaxy Expedition, 3x Return of the Dragon Lords, you can pretty much run whatever combination of spell/trap cards you think are best. If you're filthy rich, that means 3x Forbidden Droplet, 3x Evenly Matched, 3x Infinite Impermanence, etc etc. Only run Galaxy Expedition if you're running Galaxy Wizard. From my experience, Galaxy Expedition has the greatest potential to brick your hand, and without Galaxy Wizard to give you a potential level 8 monster without needing to tribute or special summon, Galaxy Expedition very easily becomes a dead card. So much so that I've toyed with removing both Galaxy Wizard and Expedition for something else, but haven't found any other combination of cards that work well.

As for the extra deck cards, outside Galaxy-Eyes Sol Flare Dragon and Prime Photon Dragon, you can slap whichever extra deck monsters you prefer in there. Accesscode Talker for example, if you're filthy rich. I just put a bunch of Galaxy and Photon Monsters in there to complete the theme.

For the side deck, I just put 1 of every hand trap or OP counter card just for reference, with the implication being that you'd want 3x of whichever you're rolling with. But putting 3x of each would be over the 15 limit. It's a pick and choose type of situation. I for one enjoy burning my opponent's hopes and dreams to the ground with Ash Blossom. And the price of Triple Tactics Talents enjoys burning my wallet to the ground.

&nbsp;

Some Combos:

The Photon Tokens summoned by Photon Sanctuary can be used to allow you to special summon Photon Vanisher. Then, when it's special summoned, you can add a Photon or Galaxy monster to your hand. Pick whichever combos best with the cards you managed to draw. If you have a Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon in your hand, it's best to search your regular Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon (or vice versa if you have Photon Dragon but no Afterglow Dragon), then use the Photon Tokens as tributes for its special summon. Then you can special summon Afterglow Dragon from your hand, special summon Prime Photon Dragon, and then use the combo in the first paragraph to, usually, finish off your opponent in one turn.

Galaxy Wizard's effects are very beneficial. You can search for whatever Galaxy card you need in your deck to combo into Prime Photon Dragon, or use its effect to make it a Lv8 monster. Then you can use Galaxy Expedition if you have it to summon Afterglow Dragon, and then use both those monsters to summon Prime Photon Dragon.

Galaxy Soldier's effect allows you to discard a light monster to special summon it in defense position, and then afterwards you can search for a Galaxy monster that you need to complete a potential combo. If you have Return of the Dragon Lords or Monster Reborn, you can sacrifice your Galaxy Eyes Photon Dragon, and then use those spell cards to special summon it. Or if you have Galaxy Trance, you can then activate it to special summon Afterglow and Photon Dragon, then XYZ summon Prime Photon Dragon.

Weaknesses: With the ton of negation effects that plague Yugioh, this deck can find it hard to win a war of attrition. Also, this deck as it stands lacks as much counterplay to your opponent's own combos. But that's what being filthy rich to afford Forbidden Droplet and its ilk is for. As a fun, non-meta deck however, I have a blast playing with it, and I hope to have all the cards for real to have some fun against friends (once I get some of them as well. I suspect buying companionship will cost more than even Forbidden Droplet x3... =/ )"

Still shaky with my terms but, as long as you go second you are fine.","Mekk-Knights are pretty easy to summon as long as you go second majority of the time. This is a deck I made long time ago that I constantly edit because I use this on dueling nexus a lot.

The Borrels in the Extra if you are questioning why they are there, are only when you acually need their effects. You really want Mekk-Knights all over the board.

If you don't know how Mekk-Knights work, you can special summon them as long as their are 2 cards in the same column. So going second is important. But, because you use special summoning regularly you are going to be hit hard if your opponent uses <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> or <a data-name=""Summoning Limit"">Summoning Limit</a>.

<a data-name=""Purple Nightfall"">Purple Nightfall</a> is for banishing and NOT for any material (Unless Absolutely Needed). You can activate his ability (Quick Effect) to banish any Mekk-Knight monster on the field. But, if you banish him you can get him back during your next turn for a endless loop(or your teammates if you are in tag duel).

His effect banishes until your next standby phase. You can use <a data-name=""Purple Nightfall"">Purple Nightfall</a> to get the<a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse""> Indigo Eclipse</a> from your deck to your hand, then special summon <a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse"">Indigo Eclipse</a> from your hand to add another Mekk-Knight to your hand.

<a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse"">Indigo Eclipse</a>'s effect depends on how many of your opponents cards are in the same column when it is special summoned. So if there is one enemy card, you get one Mekk-Knight and so forth. From there you can read the other cards and everything reveals itself.

You only really need 4-5 cards to control the field. But 3 are very specific. They are 2 continuous trap cards and a continuous spell. The traps are <a data-name=""World Legacy's Secret"">World Legacy's Secret</a> and <a data-name=""World Legacy Whispers"">World Legacy Whispers, </a>and the spell card is <a data-name=""World Legacy Key"">World Legacy Key</a>.

<a data-name=""Secre"">Secre</a><a data-name=""t"">t</a> negates monster effects that are in the same column that a Mekk-Knight is in and, when activated, can special summon from your GY any Level 5 or higher monster.

<a data-name=""Whispers"">Whispers</a> negates spell cards that are in the same column that a Mekk-Knight is in and, when activated, can add 1000 Atk and Def to any Level 5 or higher monster.

<a data-name=""Key"">Key </a>negates trap cards that are in the same column that a Mekk-Knight is in and, when activated, can add to your hand 1 World Legacy card or Mekk-Knight monster from your banished zone

Now I have one more thing. The most Important Mekk-Knight monster is<a data-name=""Mekk-Knight""> Mekk-Knight</a> <a data-name=""Indigo Eclipse"">Indigo Eclipse</a>. Once per turn (Quick Effect) You can move any Mekk-Knight Monster you control (preferably him) to another monster zone. This includes the Extra deck monsters too

Hope you like this deck. This is the first deck I am posting on this site for everyone to see. Have A great DAY!"

You might think that combo dino is no longer a thing since all the good halq tuners got banned and recently linkross also got banned - well think again. The new scrap raptor makes combo dino a thing again and believe it or not you don’t even use halq or auroradon for these combos! The scrap monsters have that part covered. I am running the bare minimum scrap engine (except raptor because it is a dino and a really good draw) - 1 Golem and 1 chimera so that you do not brick. Scrap raptor is a new card that comes out in LIOV. It is a dino tuner and works really well with a dinosaur deck since it can be searched and special summoned (off of baby, petri, and fossil dig and in some cases miscell or even oviraptor). The new dino is really good and makes it possible to do the combo. This deck also has only 2 bricks, which is a fairly small amount for a combo deck!</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Before I explain the deck just a friendly reminder that all the combos, deck explanations and card choices are in my youtube video - Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me directly. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Link to the video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0OJU4Cdno8</a></span>

&nbsp;

<b>Notes before we start</b><span>: </span>

<span>VFD = True King of all calamities </span>

<span>UCT = Ultimate conductor Tyranno</span>

<span>All the dinos can be searched off of fossil dig as well </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Here are the combos I do in my video</b><span> -</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Combo #1 (VFD combo using oviraptor as normal summon)-</b>

<span>Hand: Souleating + Baby OR Miscell </span>

<span>End on: UCT + VFD + Laggia OR Abyss Dweller (and Dokka but why would you want that if you already have VFD?)</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Combo #2 (VFD combo using Scrap Raptor as normal summon) -</b>

<span>Hand: Raptor + Lost World </span>

<span>End on: UCT + VFD + Laggia OR Abyss Dweller (same as oviraptor combo)</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Combo #3 (Nibiru proof Apollusa Combo using oviraptor) - </b>

<span>Hand: Souleating + baby OR Miscell</span>

<span>End on: UCT + Apollusa (3 negates) + Borreload Savage (2 counters) + Dokka (2 monster negates)</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Combo #4 (VFD combo using Archosaur)</b>

<span>Hand: Archosaur + Baby</span>

<span>End on: UCT + VFD + Laggia or Dweller (same combo - different way to do it)</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Combo #5 (VFD combo using Lost world)</b>

<span>Hand: Oviraptor + Lost World</span>

<span>End on: UCT + VFD </span>

&nbsp;

<span>The deck is really consistent overall, being able to perform the combo very consistently. There are also only 2 bricks in the deck, which should help overall. This deck also plays a variety of handtraps and removal in the form of ash, gamma and droplet. You can also replace the droplet with something like nibiru so that you are playing more handtraps in the deck. You can also replace the handtraps with budget alternatives handtraps but I recommend keeping gamma since it is easily the best handtrap of the format and is also fairly cheap. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Some key cards you want to see in hand are -</span>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Fossil dig (can search ANY level 6 or lower dino)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Oviraptor (is the searcher and the main normal summon of the deck)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Scrap raptor (can be used with lost world to do full combo)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Lost World (is an amazing field spell and is used in the scrap raptor combo)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Babycerasaurus (Is a very ideal card since it can special any dino from the deck)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Miscell (no explanation needed here) </span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span>There is another combo that I do not show in the video that I will show here. It ends on the exact same end board and it does the same thing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Hand: Miscell + Baby </span>

<span>End on: UCT + VFD + Dweller/Laggia </span>

 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Synchro Golem + Raptor into Crocodragon </span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Crocodragon eff - draw 1</span></li>

<h3>Getting Generaider Boss Stage In The Field Zone</h3>
<a class=""wp-more-tag mce-wp-more"" title=""Read more..."" data-name=""&lt;p&gt;So basically... I made this deck out of my hatred for dragoon. Also... I didn't know how to convert a custom deck to an excel spreadsheet... so I just made this link for a friend of mine. This is my first custom deck that's ever worked. It's also my first deck I've ever uploaded... so I'll try my best to explain it. I'm sure that there are flaws in it and I'm open to criticism to help make it better. &lt;img src="" data-wp-more=""more"" data-wp-more-text="""" data-mce-placeholder=""1"">Ultimately... you want to get </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Stage</a> in the field. There are a couple ways to do this depending on what's in your hand:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Quest</a> - This only works if you have 1+ other Generaider monster(s) in your hand... target a Generaider monster in your hand and add Generaider Boss Stage and <a data-name=""Generaider Boss Room"">Generaider Boss Room</a><a data-name=""Generaider Boss Room to your hand. Activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.""> to your hand. Activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Stage</a> - This is pretty obvious... just activate it and put it in the field.</li>
 	<li id=""&quot;card-name&quot;"" class=""&quot;engine-dark-box&quot;""><a data-name=""&quot;Loptr,"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses - Normal summon Loptr, then tribute Loptr to special summon </a><a data-name=""&quot;Mardel,"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light, then activate Mardel to search Generaider Boss Room. Again... if you have another Generaider monster in your hand, search </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Quest</a><a data-name=""&quot;Mardel,""> instead and activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.</a></li>
 	<li>Set <a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Fight in your trap zone and activate as soon as you can... (If playing on dueling nexus... I turn manual chaining on so I can activate it during the opp's draw phase). </a></li>
 	<li>Summon <a data-name=""&quot;Condemned"">Condemned Witch and add </a><a data-name=""&quot;Forbidden"">Forbidd</a>en Droplet (not necessary but I mean hey- it helps). During your opp's main phase, activate Condemned Witch and summon <a data-name=""&quot;Loptr,"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses and just do the thing previously explained. It's important to realize that this only gets Boss Stage in your hand (or Boss Stage and Boss Room if you searched </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Quest...  you won't be able to activate them until the next turn).</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Generaider Monsters</h3>
Once you get Boss Stage in the field zone, the world is your metaphorical oyster. When your opp adds a card from their main deck to their hand (which basically means during the draw phase) Boss Stage lets you special summon 1 Generaider monster from your deck. Since Boss Stage also lets you flood your empty monster zones with Generaider Tokens that can be utilized by other Generaider Monsters, you should special summon different Generaider Monsters according to the situation.
<ul>
 	<li>By default, I normally special summon a <a data-name=""&quot;Loptr,"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses if the opp isn't about to do something serious</a>. Not only does this allow you to tribute a Generaider token (or Loptr itself if you're really desperate), but it also adds 1000 ATK/DEF to all Generaider monsters/tokens during your opp's turn. Most of the time, I'll use Loptr's effect to summon <a data-name=""&quot;Harr,"">Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms</a>.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Harr,"">Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms- This guy is pretty effective. Once per turn, you can tribute two Generaider tokens (or monsters if you need to) and negate any opp's card activation and destroy that card. Not only that, if your opp draws a card  any time other than the draw phase, you can activate Harr and make your opp choose 1 card from their hand or field to send to the grave (once per turn).</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Utgarda,"">Utgarda, Generaider Boss of Delusion</a>- Pretty good card that let's you tribute 2 tokens (or generaider monsters) and banish 1 card your opp controls.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Nidhogg,"">Nidhogg, Generaider Boss of Ice</a>- Let's you negate 1 special summon your opp tries to make. (side note: just started watching Soul Eater and Nidhogg is in it... so yeah ¯_(ツ)_/¯)</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Dovelgus,"">Dovelgus, Generaider Boss of Iron- I use this if I have more than one Generaider monster and/or machine kaijus in my hand. Tribute any number of Generaider tokens (or monsters) and special summon the same number of machine and/or Generaider monsters in your hand.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Hela,"">Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom- Use this by tributing 1 Generaider token (or monster) and bringing back a Generaider monster from your grave. I also use this to put as many level 9 monsters on the board for Extra Deck special summons.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss Room- Not a monster, but very important. Since you will most likely be activating a lot of effects with Generaider Monsters, your opp is more likely to chain something with those effects. If this happens, you can discard 1 card and negate it. Not only that, but both players then draw a card... which paired with Boss Stage, is a free Generaider special summon. Two birds, one stone.</a></li>
</ul>
It seems like a lot... but honestly you get the hang of it really quick. Another helpful thing is that these are all quick effects, so say your opp brings out the dreaded mystic mine (or any other shutdown card), you can activate Harr or Utgarda and yeet it off the field before anything unnecessary happens.
<h3>Kaiju</h3>
I think Kaiju is pretty underplayed. It's kind of hard to make a pure Kaiju deck since you can only control one Kaiju at a time... but that's what makes it a perfect addition to a 40 card deck.

I mainly have Kaiju in it to remove Dragoon or any other cards (but mainly Dragoon... I hate Dragoon) while avoiding ""destroyed by battle/ effect"" conditions. Normally I give my <a data-name=""&quot;Gamecial,"">Gamecial, the Sea Turtle Kaiju and myself </a><a data-name=""&quot;Jizukiru,"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>. If I'm especially lucky, I use Forbidden to add some more damage to the opp.

<a data-name=""&quot;Interrupted"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a> is in here to act as a sort of Raigeki. Not only can you even out the field, but you can later banish Slumber and add 1 Kaiju from your deck to your hand.

<a data-name=""&quot;Kaiju"">Kaiju Capture Mission, </a><a data-name=""&quot;The"">The Kaiju Files, and </a><a data-name=""&quot;Kyoutou"">Kyoutou Waterfront are included to give yourself some Kaiju counters. I think that Kaiju monster effects are seriously overlooked and can be huge game changers. Just remember that if your opp has a Kaiju monster, they can also utilize Kaiju Counters from anywhere on the field. So be careful that you don't give your opp a Kaiju monster that can use 2 Kaiju counters while you can only use 3. </a>
<h3>Other ""stuff""</h3>
So there are some other cards in here that are pretty important.
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Trias"">Trias Hierarchia- Works really great with Generaider tokens. During either turn, you can tribute 3 (or less) fairy tokens (or monsters) and special summon this card from your grave or hand. Then you can destroy 1 card on the field and draw 2 cards. It's also a level 9 monster, which is foundation of most the extra deck.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Exodia,"">Exodia, the Legendary Defender- This card gains ATK/DEF based on the combined ATK/DEF of the two cards used for its tribute summon. Not only that, but if possible, you can tribute 5 monsters you control and this card gains the combined ATK/DEF of those 5 monsters. Since Generaider floods your board with monsters pretty quickly, this shouldn't be too hard to do.  <em>Not only that!</em> But if you tribute 5 monsters for this card's summon, and then destroy an opp's dark/fiend monster, you automatically win. To be fair, if this gains the attack of 5 monsters, I don't think you have to worry too much about the dark/fiend condition. </a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Malefic"">Malefic Cyber End Dragon- Another card that I think is pretty overlooked. It's probably the easiest card with 4000 ATk to summon that I know. All you have to do to special summon this card is banish 1 Cyber End Dragon from your extra deck. Conveniently enough, there is 1 Cyber End Dragon in the extra deck at your disposal. It's important to note that if there is no face-up card on the field, then this card is destroyed as soon as you special summon it. Also... other monsters you control cannot attack. (If you have 3 other level 9 monsters on the field, you can special summon </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon, detach 1 card, negate the ""other monsters you control cannot attack"" effect of Malefic Cyber End Dragon, and deal up to a whopping 8500 damage.)</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;The"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode and </a><a data-name=""&quot;The"">The Winged Dragon of Ra</a>- Sphere mode is in here for the usual reason. Winged Dragon of Ra is included for when you regain control of the Sphere Mode you give the opp. Also... with all the special summons you can do with Generaider, your opp is more likely to hit you with a Sphere Mode of their own. If this happens, you can use it against them and summon Winged Ra from your deck.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Ash"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- I only run 1 Ash Blossom because... well I ran out of room in the deck. One is still helpful because it can be tributed by Hela, </a><a data-name=""&quot;Generaider"">Generaider Boss of Doom to bring back a Generaider from the grave.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Ghost"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries- Another display of my hatred for Dragoon. The moment your opp controls more monsters than you, you can discard Ghost Reaper and select Dragoon in your extra deck. If your opp has Dragoon(s) in their extra deck... they don't anymore. The best part is that, even if your opp doesn't have a Dragoon, there is no punishment for an incorrect ""guess"". I also keep </a><a data-name=""&quot;Time"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL in the side deck for the same effect. I just chose those two to place in the side deck because those are the two cards that can be problematic with this deck. You can substitute these into your extra deck (or any monster that you wish) and do the same thing. Just remember that the real enemy here is Dragoon.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Waking"">Waking the Dragon- Another card that I feel is underplayed (and that's fine by me) is Waking the Dragon. It literally exists for no other reason but to be destroyed by the opp's card effect. You can then special summon any monster (that you can) from your extra deck or main deck. Any fusion monster is fair game (except Dragoon), but be careful if selecting an XYZ monster to special summon. If you're gonna special summon an XYZ monster from the extra deck, I'd recommend either </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere, </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number 9: Dyson Sphere, or </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon. These monsters don't require XYZ material to work their magic. </a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Draining"">Draining Shield- Pretty self-explanatory. Free Life-Points/ attack negation. If you're lucky, you can use the extra life-points to give your Ra some more firepower.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Rank-Up-Magic"">Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force- I'll admit, this adds brick potential to a deck that is hard enough to normal summon with. However, I still wasn't sure if I should get rid of it (let me know what you think I guess). If you do get to use Rank-Up on Dyson Sphere... the payout is huge. As long as C9 Chaos Dyson is on the field, you can add up the materials to deal some wumbo damage.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Side Deck</h3>
Some cards that I have in here that suit me.  There's only 10 cards in it, so you can replace and add to the side deck as much as you want, but since I wrote this much, I might as well explain why I have what I have in it.
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Nibiru,"">Nibiru, the Primal Being- Um... same reason it's ever placed in the side deck. Even if you do hand the opp a card with a hella amount of ATK/DEF, the Kaiju aspect (and possibly Raigeki if you're lucky) can help you get rid of that. </a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Droll"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird- Just here to stop the draw. Placed it in the side deck with the idea of stopping Exodia draws. Can be used to stop any deck that relies on a lot of draw power.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Time"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""&quot;Number"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL- explained before... just in here to use with </a><a data-name=""&quot;Ghost"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Mind"">Mind Crush- Versatile but intended to stop Exodia. When you see the opp add a card to their hand, just write it down and make em get rid of it. Very devastating to Exodia, but use as you see fit.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""&quot;Cloak"">Cloak and Dagger- If you know that your opp relies on one card (e.g. Cyber Dragon, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, etc.), you can try and set this up to tear them down. </a></li>
</ul>
Again this is just what I have in the side deck, you can replace it with what you see fit.
<h3>Extra Deck</h3>
Not much to say about it. Generaider adds a lot of level 9 monsters on your field, so the Extra Deck is mostly XYZ monsters that require level 9 monsters. All things considered, the XYZ monsters each work any situation. <a data-name=""&quot;Jormungandr,"">Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity is a Generaider monster that can be activated each turn to 1000 ATK/DEF each turn. Also, it forces your opp to draw a card, which lets you special summon a Generaider monster from your deck if you have Boss Stage in the field zone. Other than, it's pretty much up to you what you want to summon and when you want to. </a>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
Soooooooo.... yeah. That's it. The downside to having a bunch of level 9 monsters is that bricks exist. However, this deck bricks just as much for me as any meta deck... which is to say, it doesn't brick too often. This is my first deck that I'm posting and I might do more... but idk. If you have any criticism to make, no matter how harsh, please make it. Also, I'm relatively new to Yugioh, but dang I didn't know decks could get this expensive. Personally, this deck has worked out on most other deck types that I've played (Cyber Dragon, Drytron, Dragoon (ew), Ojama, Darkworld, Exodia, Traptrix). With a good start, it shuts down <em>most</em> meta (kekw Eldlich is touch-and-go). This deck is ultimately for my man Rowan, but if you think it would work out for you too... feel free to do whatever you want.

""&gt;

So basically... I made this deck out of my hatred for dragoon. Also... I didn't know how to convert a custom deck to an excel spreadsheet... so I just made this link for a friend of mine. This is my first custom deck that's ever worked. It's also my first deck I've ever uploaded... so I'll try my best to explain it. I'm sure that there are flaws in it and I'm open to criticism to help make it better. &lt;!--more--&gt;
<h3>Getting Generaider Boss Stage In The Field Zone</h3>
Ultimately... you want to get <a data-name=""Generaider Boss Stage"">Generaider Boss Stage</a> in the field. There are a couple ways to do this depending on what's in your hand:
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Generaider Boss Quest"">Generaider Boss Quest</a> - This only works if you have 1+ other Generaider monster(s) in your hand... target a Generaider monster in your hand and add Generaider Boss Stage and <a data-name=""Generaider Boss Room"">Generaider Boss Room to your hand. Activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Generaider Boss Stage"">Generaider Boss Stage</a> - This is pretty obvious... just activate it and put it in the field.</li>
 	<li class=""engine-dark-box""><a data-name=""Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses "">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses - Normal summon Loptr, then tribute Loptr to special summon </a><a data-name=""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light, then activate Mardel to search Generaider Boss Room. Again... if you have another Generaider monster in your hand, search </a><a data-name=""Generaider Boss Quest"">Generaider Boss Quest</a><a data-name=""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light""> instead and activate Boss Stage and set Boss Room.</a></li>
 	<li>Set <a data-name=""Generaider Boss Fight"">Generaider Boss Fight in your trap zone and activate as soon as you can... (If playing on dueling nexus... I turn manual chaining on so I can activate it during the opp's draw phase). </a></li>
 	<li>Summon <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch and add </a><a data-name=""Forbidden Drople"">Forbidd</a>en Droplet (not necessary but I mean hey- it helps). During your opp's main phase, activate Condemned Witch and summon <a data-name=""Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses and just do the thing previously explained. It's important to realize that this only gets Boss Stage in your hand (or Boss Stage and Boss Room if you searched </a><a data-name=""Generaider Boss Quest"">Generaider Boss Quest...  you won't be able to activate them until the next turn).</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Generaider Monsters</h3>
Once you get Boss Stage in the field zone, the world is your metaphorical oyster. When your opp adds a card from their main deck to their hand (which basically means during the draw phase) Boss Stage lets you special summon 1 Generaider monster from your deck. Since Boss Stage also lets you flood your empty monster zones with Generaider Tokens that can be utilized by other Generaider Monsters, you should special summon different Generaider Monsters according to the situation.
<ul>
 	<li>By default, I normally special summon a <a data-name=""Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses"">Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses if the opp isn't about to do something serious</a>. Not only does this allow you to tribute a Generaider token (or Loptr itself if you're really desperate), but it also adds 1000 ATK/DEF to all Generaider monsters/tokens during your opp's turn. Most of the time, I'll use Loptr's effect to summon <a data-name=""Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms"">Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms</a>.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms"">Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms- This guy is pretty effective. Once per turn, you can tribute two Generaider tokens (or monsters if you need to) and negate any opp's card activation and destroy that card. Not only that, if your opp draws a card  any time other than the draw phase, you can activate Harr and make your opp choose 1 card from their hand or field to send to the grave (once per turn).</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Utgarda, Generaider Boss of Delusion"">Utgarda, Generaider Boss of Delusion</a>- Pretty good card that let's you tribute 2 tokens (or generaider monsters) and banish 1 card your opp controls.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Nidhogg, Generaider Boss of Ice"">Nidhogg, Generaider Boss of Ice</a>- Let's you negate 1 special summon your opp tries to make. (side note: just started watching Soul Eater and Nidhogg is in it... so yeah ¯_(ツ)_/¯)</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Dovelgus, Generaider Boss of Iron"">Dovelgus, Generaider Boss of Iron- I use this if I have more than one Generaider monster and/or machine kaijus in my hand. Tribute any number of Generaider tokens (or monsters) and special summon the same number of machine and/or Generaider monsters in your hand.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom"">Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom- Use this by tributing 1 Generaider token (or monster) and bringing back a Generaider monster from your grave. I also use this to put as many level 9 monsters on the board for Extra Deck special summons.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Generaider Boss Room"">Generaider Boss Room- Not a monster, but very important. Since you will most likely be activating a lot of effects with Generaider Monsters, your opp is more likely to chain something with those effects. If this happens, you can discard 1 card and negate it. Not only that, but both players then draw a card... which paired with Boss Stage, is a free Generaider special summon. Two birds, one stone.</a></li>
</ul>
It seems like a lot... but honestly you get the hang of it really quick. Another helpful thing is that these are all quick effects, so say your opp brings out the dreaded mystic mine (or any other shutdown card), you can activate Harr or Utgarda and yeet it off the field before anything unnecessary happens.
<h3>Kaiju</h3>
I think Kaiju is pretty underplayed. It's kind of hard to make a pure Kaiju deck since you can only control one Kaiju at a time... but that's what makes it a perfect addition to a 40 card deck.

I mainly have Kaiju in it to remove Dragoon or any other cards (but mainly Dragoon... I hate Dragoon) while avoiding ""destroyed by battle/ effect"" conditions. Normally I give my <a data-name=""Gamecial, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gamecial, the Sea Turtle Kaiju and myself </a><a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>. If I'm especially lucky, I use Forbidden to add some more damage to the opp.

<a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a> is in here to act as a sort of Raigeki. Not only can you even out the field, but you can later banish Slumber and add 1 Kaiju from your deck to your hand.

<a data-name=""Kaiju Capture Mission"">Kaiju Capture Mission, </a><a data-name=""The Kaiju Files"">The Kaiju Files, and </a><a data-name=""Kyoutou Waterfront "">Kyoutou Waterfront are included to give yourself some Kaiju counters. I think that Kaiju monster effects are seriously overlooked and can be huge game changers. Just remember that if your opp has a Kaiju monster, they can also utilize Kaiju Counters from anywhere on the field. So be careful that you don't give your opp a Kaiju monster that can use 2 Kaiju counters while you can only use 3. </a>
<h3>Other ""stuff""</h3>
So there are some other cards in here that are pretty important.
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia- Works really great with Generaider tokens. During either turn, you can tribute 3 (or less) fairy tokens (or monsters) and special summon this card from your grave or hand. Then you can destroy 1 card on the field and draw 2 cards. It's also a level 9 monster, which is foundation of most the extra deck.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Exodia, the Legendary Defender"">Exodia, the Legendary Defender- This card gains ATK/DEF based on the combined ATK/DEF of the two cards used for its tribute summon. Not only that, but if possible, you can tribute 5 monsters you control and this card gains the combined ATK/DEF of those 5 monsters. Since Generaider floods your board with monsters pretty quickly, this shouldn't be too hard to do.  <em>Not only that!</em> But if you tribute 5 monsters for this card's summon, and then destroy an opp's dark/fiend monster, you automatically win. To be fair, if this gains the attack of 5 monsters, I don't think you have to worry too much about the dark/fiend condition. </a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Malefic Cyber End Dragon"">Malefic Cyber End Dragon- Another card that I think is pretty overlooked. It's probably the easiest card with 4000 ATk to summon that I know. All you have to do to special summon this card is banish 1 Cyber End Dragon from your extra deck. Conveniently enough, there is 1 Cyber End Dragon in the extra deck at your disposal. It's important to note that if there is no face-up card on the field, then this card is destroyed as soon as you special summon it. Also... other monsters you control cannot attack. (If you have 3 other level 9 monsters on the field, you can special summon </a><a data-name=""Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon"">Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon, detach 1 card, negate the ""other monsters you control cannot attack"" effect of Malefic Cyber End Dragon, and deal up to a whopping 8500 damage.)</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode and </a><a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra"">The Winged Dragon of Ra</a>- Sphere mode is in here for the usual reason. Winged Dragon of Ra is included for when you regain control of the Sphere Mode you give the opp. Also... with all the special summons you can do with Generaider, your opp is more likely to hit you with a Sphere Mode of their own. If this happens, you can use it against them and summon Winged Ra from your deck.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring- I only run 1 Ash Blossom because... well I ran out of room in the deck. One is still helpful because it can be tributed by Hela, </a><a data-name=""Generaider Boss of Doom"">Generaider Boss of Doom to bring back a Generaider from the grave.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries- Another display of my hatred for Dragoon. The moment your opp controls more monsters than you, you can discard Ghost Reaper and select Dragoon in your extra deck. If your opp has Dragoon(s) in their extra deck... they don't anymore. The best part is that, even if your opp doesn't have a Dragoon, there is no punishment for an incorrect ""guess"". I also keep </a><a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL in the side deck for the same effect. I just chose those two to place in the side deck because those are the two cards that can be problematic with this deck. You can substitute these into your extra deck (or any monster that you wish) and do the same thing. Just remember that the real enemy here is Dragoon.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Waking the Dragon"">Waking the Dragon- Another card that I feel is underplayed (and that's fine by me) is Waking the Dragon. It literally exists for no other reason but to be destroyed by the opp's card effect. You can then special summon any monster (that you can) from your extra deck or main deck. Any fusion monster is fair game (except Dragoon), but be careful if selecting an XYZ monster to special summon. If you're gonna special summon an XYZ monster from the extra deck, I'd recommend either </a><a data-name=""Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere"">Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere, </a><a data-name=""Number 9: Dyson Sphere"">Number 9: Dyson Sphere, or </a><a data-name=""Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon"">Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon. These monsters don't require XYZ material to work their magic. </a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Draining Shield"">Draining Shield- Pretty self-explanatory. Free Life-Points/ attack negation. If you're lucky, you can use the extra life-points to give your Ra some more firepower.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force"">Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force- I'll admit, this adds brick potential to a deck that is hard enough to normal summon with. However, I still wasn't sure if I should get rid of it (let me know what you think I guess). If you do get to use Rank-Up on Dyson Sphere... the payout is huge. As long as C9 Chaos Dyson is on the field, you can add up the materials to deal some wumbo damage.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Side Deck</h3>
Some cards that I have in here that suit me.  There's only 10 cards in it, so you can replace and add to the side deck as much as you want, but since I wrote this much, I might as well explain why I have what I have in it.

 	<li><a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being- Um... same reason it's ever placed in the side deck. Even if you do hand the opp a card with a hella amount of ATK/DEF, the Kaiju aspect (and possibly Raigeki if you're lucky) can help you get rid of that. </a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird- Just here to stop the draw. Placed it in the side deck with the idea of stopping Exodia draws. Can be used to stop any deck that relies on a lot of draw power.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL"">Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL- explained before... just in here to use with </a><a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Mind Crush"">Mind Crush- Versatile but intended to stop Exodia. When you see the opp add a card to their hand, just write it down and make em get rid of it. Very devastating to Exodia, but use as you see fit.</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Cloak and Dagger"">Cloak and Dagger- If you know that your opp relies on one card (e.g. Cyber Dragon, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, etc.), you can try and set this up to tear them down. </a></li>
</ul>
Again this is just what I have in the side deck, you can replace it with what you see fit.
<h3>Extra Deck</h3>
Not much to say about it. Generaider adds a lot of level 9 monsters on your field, so the Extra Deck is mostly XYZ monsters that require level 9 monsters. All things considered, the XYZ monsters each work any situation. <a data-name=""Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity"">Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity is a Generaider monster that can be activated each turn to 1000 ATK/DEF each turn. Also, it forces your opp to draw a card, which lets you special summon a Generaider monster from your deck if you have Boss Stage in the field zone. Other than, it's pretty much up to you what you want to summon and when you want to. </a>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
Soooooooo.... yeah. That's it. The downside to having a bunch of level 9 monsters is that bricks exist. However, this deck bricks just as much for me as any meta deck... which is to say, it doesn't brick too often. This is my first deck that I'm posting and I might do more... but idk. If you have any criticism to make, no matter how harsh, please make it. Also, I'm relatively new to Yugioh, but dang I didn't know decks could get this expensive. Personally, this deck has worked out on most other deck types that I've played (Cyber Dragon, Drytron, Dragoon (ew), Ojama, Darkworld, Exodia, Traptrix). With a good start, it shuts down <em>most</em> meta (kekw Eldlich is touch-and-go). This deck is ultimately for my man Rowan, but if you think it would work out for you too... feel free to do whatever you want.

With Dogmatika and handtraps too, how?!","https://youtu.be/oYmCxLHpgMU

The Armed Dragon Thunder series negs too much, that's why it's almost impossible to play the deck. So we have to try different approach for the card to make it playable and can win consistently. Endboard is Armed Dragon Thunder Lv10 + VFD + Virtual World Shenshen follow-up. The combo only needs <strong>1 Halqifibrax</strong>, watch the video for tutorial. The ceiling will be higher because we play Dogmatika to extend further while being ritual searcher for Knight of Armor Dragon via Herald of the Arc Light and we also run handtraps so we dont have to insta scoop going second. 1 Nibiru because it's seacrhable via Gallant Granite if we already have Adamancipator Researcher on hand.

Pros: Consistent, legit endboard, big staples, have Dogmatika as backup if interrupted.

Cons: It's better to play without the Armed Dragon lineup cus it's all bricks."

I need some feedback on how to make this more efficient ,"This is just a way to turbo out Dragoon by using Mudragon of the swamp. I did this by using the tri-brigades to link summon any link 2 with bottom left and right arrows, then used rescue ferret to make a lv 6 synchro (mudragon). Finally i would link off Tri-Brigade Kerass and the link it made into a dragon link monster (Armillyre, the Starleader Dragon or Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman come to mind). Now you have a fusion substitute for dark magician (mudragon) and a dragon effect monster on the field.

I need some feedback and assistance on making this more efficient. If any1 has ideas for good engines that would make this more consistent or powerful, plz let me know

I used Danger!s for bodies and the beast ones have good synergy with tri-brigades

The tuners I thought of were The Fabled Rubyruda and Afanc (afnac comes in blazing vortex soon)

I used zoodiac for a decent amount of lv4s not just for their own engine, but so I could summon them with Rescue Ferret alongside a lv2 tuner

Peropero Cerperus is just a good lv3 target for rescue ferret and will destroy your opponents stuff if you take damage

As a tech against traps, I used Scrap Goblin so I can turbo with rescue ferret into Naturia Barkion

Cards I thought would be good are Dark Desertapir and Mist Valley Baby Roc but they miss timing so they don't work

 	<li>Ojama Pajama searches for any Ojama card AND THEN you discard 1 card. This combos well with Ojama Pink or Ojamagic.</li>
 	<li>With Ojama Duo you can summon 2 Ojama token on opponents field to disrupt them. Then on your turn you can banish Ojama Duo to summon 2 Ojama from Deck to easily get Ojama Knight (if you have a fusion method ready). Like this you have blocked 4 Monster fields</li>
 	<li>Use Sky Cavalry Centaurea to get rid of Monsters from the field to the hand (so you get more value out of Ojama King for example)</li>
 	<li>Use Quaking Mirror Force in combination of Monster Zone blocking abilities from Ojama Pink, Ojama King or Ojama Knight</li>

","I put Ash Blossom in the deck for two reasons, the first being her effects and the second being she is a level 3 tuner. I recommend using Ash Blossom combined with a level 4 monster so you can synchro summon Clear Wing Fast Dragon. Use Clear Wing Fast Dragon's effect to counter your opponents extra deck cards! Use the level 4 monsters/trap monsters to xyz summon Dark rebellion xyz Dragon. Once you have the deck's rank up magic card in your hand, waste all of Dark rebellion xyz Dragon's materials so you can use the rank up magic to xyz summon the deck's ace monster... Dark Requiem xyz Dragon! Make sure not to use all of Dark Requiem xyz Dragon's materials at once, because you will need one to stop your opponents monster effects+ you get Dark Rebellion xyz Dragon back from the grave.

Please note: This is not Yuto's exact deck from the anime, its just a phantom knight deck.

Please like the decklist if you used it :)"

You can play neo space connector and aqua dolphin instead of sublim and squeak

Infernoble is currently my favorite deck and  love making variants of it like igknight infernoble and no vfd infernoble

TTT is here for obvious reasons

Infernoble is bad against established boards and the opponent wont let  you go first again, so you play dark ruler.

field barrier is just a funny card for a mystic mine matchup, locking out the field spell zones you can play nibiru instead

41 cards is fine since there are only 4 garnets and 2 of them you DEFINITELY dont want in your hand (plague and cloak). squeak and 001 are playable as long as you open sublim with squeak and halq summons from the hand and deck.

combo A:
<ol>
 	<li>summon scales, discard to send cloak</li>
 	<li>banish cloak to search boots</li>
 	<li>sp boots, make isolde,search ipg</li>
 	<li>send 4 (blade,joy, dur, fossil) summon armageddon</li>
 	<li>arma eff, send plague</li>
 	<li>banish boots search shade, sp summon scales</li>
 	<li>link arma, isolde, and scales for apollousa</li>
 	<li>set shade, summon shade</li>
 	<li>summon plage from gy</li>
 	<li>make halq, summmon 001</li>
 	<li>link oo1 and halq for auroradon, summon 3 tokens, summon 001</li>
 	<li>synchro summon power tool, search ddr</li>
 	<li>tribute power tool and aurora for coltwing, summon 2 tokens,summon 001</li>
 	<li>make herald</li>
 	<li>banish 2 to add back phoenix blade</li>
 	<li>disard phoenix blade to summon plague w ddr</li>
 	<li>make roland w plague and a token, roland eff</li>
 	<li>use plagues eff, place 1 to summon</li>
 	<li>make charles w plague and coltwing</li>
 	<li>make savage w roland and a token, equip auroradon</li>
 	<li>end phase equip a couple cards to charles, resolve roland</li>
</ol>
Results- 3 monster negates and 2 omni negates

There is also an added total effect lockdown strategy with Secret Village, Royal Decree, Haine and Jackal King (V1 had a bit of a higher focus on this strategy).</span>

<span>Secret Village of the Spellcasters - Prevents the activation of your Opponent's Spell Cards so long as only you control a Spellcaster monster and Haine helps to immediately destroy any Spellcasters your opponent summons.</span>

<span>Royal Decree - Negates the effects of all other Trap Cards. Though it is quite vulnerable to any form of disruption or destruction so always activate this last as the other cards in the combo prevent this. Also, don't let your opponent chain other trap cards to this card's activation.</span>

<span>Witchcrafter Haine - Spell Speed 2 Spot destruction of any face-up monster your opponent controls so long as you have Spell Cards in your hand to use as cost and with Secret Village of the Spellcasters up, your opponent can't activate Spell Cards without a face-up Spellcaster on the field.</span>

<span>Mythical Beast Jackal King - For the measly cost of just 2 Spell Counters, negates the effect activation of 1 monster and destroys it. This is also Spell Speed 2.</span>

<span>Yes, with a good hand, this is acheivable on the 1st turn. Also yes, I have actually acheived this combo many times.</span>

<span>Then Summon Witchcrafter Madame Verre, Mythical Beast Master Cerberus and Endymion the Mighty Master of Magic along with having cards to gain and gather Spell Counters, you have yourself an almost completely unbreakable board (can only be broken by an opponent's Special Summon tribute effects like the Kaiju monsters).</span>

<span>The nuke OTK Strategy when going second is a much more consistent strategy and there are many card combos to acheive this with. The least complicated one is having <span>Mythical Beast Master Cerberus, Servant of Endymion, Spell Power Mastery, Wichcrafter Creation, Mythical Institution and Any other Spell Card as the starting hand</span>. <strong>First off, activate Institution</strong> (handy but also a disposable first card in case of disruption). <strong>Then place Master Cerberus in the Pendulum Zone and destroy it with its effect to add Jackal King to your hand</strong> and place 2 spell counters on institution. Then <strong>place Jackal King and destroy it</strong> to <strong>Special Summon Master Creberus to the Extra Monster Zone</strong> and place 2 more spell counters on Institution. then <strong>place Servant in the Pendulum Zone</strong> placing 2 spell counters on Master Cerberus. Then <strong>activate Spell Power Mastery</strong> to <strong>add Endymion the Mighty Master to your hand and place the spell counter from the effect on Servant</strong>. Then <strong>Place Endymion in the Pendulum Zone</strong>. <span>At this point, you have 6 spell counters on Master Cerberus, 4 on Institution and 3 on Servant.</span> <strong>Use Servant's Pendulum Effect</strong> to <strong>Special Summon herself</strong> and <strong>either Magister of Endymion or Mythical Beast Bashilisk</strong> from the Deck. Then <strong>use Endymion's Pendulum Effect</strong> to Special Summon himself by removing the 6 spell counters from Master Cerberus and destroy up to 5 cards on the field as there are 5 cards now on your field that can store spell counters. Make clearing your opponent's back row a priority and make sure to leave 1 of your opponent's monsters on the field if possible. Then <strong>use Master Cerberus' Monster Effect</strong> to banish your opponent's remaining monster by removing the 4 spell counters from Institution. then <strong>Activate Witchcrafter Creation</strong> to add one of the Witchcrafter monsters that are Level 4 or lower to your hand. Normal Summon said monster, and <strong>use its effect</strong> to tribute itself and discard the last Spell Card in your hand to <strong>Special Summon Haine</strong> from your Deck. Battle Phase and you have more than enough for an OTK. Unfortunately, this is quite weak to hand-trap disruption from your opponent and destruction protection, hence why I moved on to v3.</span>"

The Shaddoll engine works really well going first since the effects of Hedgehog and Beast will also trigger when you tribute them with Red-Eyes Transmigration or discard them for Cross-Sheep. Usually you wanna tribute two Benten to summon your Lord of the Red though to get maximum value. Shaddoll Fusion going second is still insane since you can send Dragon for an easy s/t pop plus Beast for a draw as well as another Drytron name (Light attribute for Construct) to gain even more advantage.

The perfect combination between Danger and fabled effects gives the opportunity to special summon synchro monsters very easly, who help you to draw many cards.

Chawa and cerburrel , 1 and 2 stars, are very versatile in order to obtain all synchro you need.

halqfibrax is perfect to summon formula synchro  in order to synchro fusion it with librarian and ragin to have Cosmic Blazar Dragon in chain to negate (and also we draw 2 cards)

This deck is not very simply to play, player has to  make perfect choices each turn; but it can give you big satisfactions"
