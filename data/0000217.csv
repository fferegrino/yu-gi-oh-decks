Cards such as ""Virtual World Mai-Hime - Lulu"", ""Emergency Teleport"" and ""Virtual World Gate - Qinglong"" give the deck great consistency, while the other Virtual World monsters allow for quick field swarming and get the Virtual World spell/traps in the GY quickly. One of the best elements of the deck is it's recovery, with cards such as ""Virtual World Xiezhi- Jiji"" that allow you to add Virtual World monsters back to tour hand from the GY in the end phase, and ""Virtual World Gate - Chuche"" that can shuffle your banished Virtual World cards into the deck to give you almost unlimited resources.  Tech choices: By using ""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"" to send ""Necroworld Banshee"" from your deck to the GY, you can activate ""Zombie World"", a card that can kill various meta decks such as Tri-Brigade. It can also send ""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"" which you can use ""Dragonlark Pairen"" to revive from the GY. ""Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger"" gives your ""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"" one more overlay unit to wipe the field with. ""Muddy Mudragon"" can fuse with any DARK monster, usually ""Ultimaya Tzolkin"" to form ""Invoked Caliga"", which allows each player only one monster effect and attack per turn, which cards like ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"" and ""Solemn Strike"" can stop easily.  The side deck contains some cards that can be exchanged with ""Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo"" for other floodgate effects.  Weaknesses: Destroying the first summon or Virtual World Gate (needs other Virtual World cards on the field to start combos), banishing floodgates (the Virtual World Gates need to be in GY to activate), ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"" (if you cannot use the ability of ""Ultimaya Tzolkin"" before the fifth summon)."

The main combo which opens up with One For One or Unexpected Dai this is easy to follow and has a lot of different routes you can take depending the cards in hand or the end board you want. To start activate <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a> or <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a> to bring out <a data-name=""Sunseed Genius Loci"">Sunseed Genius Loci</a>, link summon into <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Sunavalon Dryas</a> and activate its effect adding <a data-name=""Sunvine Sowing"">Sunvine Sowing</a> to hand. Activate the Sowing bringing out <a data-name=""Sunseed Twin"">Sunseed Twin</a> to the left or right of the Dryas. You take 1000 dmg and activate the effects of the Dryas and the Twins. Chain link 1 the Twins to bring Loci back to the field to the other side of the Dryas then chain link 2 the Dryas to heal back the 1000 LP. Link summon <a data-name=""Sunvine Healer"">Sunvine Healer</a> below the Dryas and activate its effect adding you 300 LP (during this stage of the combo if <a data-name=""Aromage Laurel"">Aromage Laurel</a> or <a data-name=""Rose Girl"">Rose Girl</a> are in hand you can activate their effects to help swarm the field). Use the Dryas and the Healer to link summon <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a>, activate the effect of Jasmine to send the Twins to grave netting you a <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> from deck. Link summon the Loci for another Dryas in the Jasmine arrow zone. Activate the effect of Lonefire tributing itself to bring <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a> to the field, this triggers Mudan's effect to add <a data-name=""Rikka Glamour"">Rikka Glamour</a> to hand. Activate Glamour, tributing Mudan to add <a data-name=""Primula The Rikka Fairy"">Primula The Rikka Fairy</a> and <a data-name=""Cactus Bouncer"">Cactus Bouncer </a>to hand, chain the Primula to special summon itself. Link Summon <a data-name=""Sunavalon Melias"">Sunavalon Melias</a> using the Jasmine and the Primula, this will trigger the effect of Melias bringing out Loci again from the grave. Link summon <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryatrentiay"">Sunavalon Dryatrentiay</a> using the Dryas from before and the Melias you just brought out. On summon Dryatrentiay's effect triggers adding <a data-name=""Sunavalon Bloom"">Sunavalon Bloom</a> to hand. Set Bloom then link summon <a data-name=""Sunvine Thrasher"">Sunvine Thrasher</a> using the Loci, this activates its effect boosting it's attack equal to its link rating making it a 4000 Atk beat stick. Finally use your normal summon to bring out the Cactus Bouncer. This means on your opponents turn they will not be able to special summon monsters, and on the activation of of Bloom the effects of all monsters they currently control are negated and during battle Dryatrentiay gains attack equal to the combined attack of all monsters it points to in this case 5800, plus with Sowing in grave if a plant monster you control would be destroyed by card effect you can banish Sowing to negate your plant monsters destruction. Regarding this deck <a data-name=""Danger! Bigfoot"">Danger! Bigfoot</a> adds a beater and draw engine to the end board, and the other monsters in there are great extenders. The Extra Deck is pretty tight but <a data-name=""Queen Of Thorns"">Queen Of Thorns</a> works well when your opponent specials from hand alot and <a data-name=""Benghalancer The Resurgent"">Benghalancer The Resurgent</a> is good for going second and getting a dangerous effect monster off the field. Downsides to this deck are pretty apparent it's easily disrupted by cards like Ash Blossom or Nibiru and it takes a good hand to be able to go second.

The eye of timaeus allows me to summon not only dragoon but other powerful monsters as well like dark magician the dragon knight, who alongsidewith eternal soul perform a lockdown so he and dark magicians you control become imune to your opponent cards, while your spell/traps become imune to target and destroying effects. Also i run secret village of spellcasters, that can lock any non spellcaster deck from playing spell cards."

The deck is relatively consistent, with cards such as ""Magician's Rod"" and ""Soul Servant"" to increase the likelyhood of winning. ""The Eye of Timaeus"" and ""Secrets of Dark Magic"" both allow access to various toolbox extra deck monsters that Dark Magician has, from ""Dark Paladin"" being able to wipe out all dragon decks in one hit, to ""Dark Magician Girl, the Dragon Knight"", which is a great control card that can help you slowly out-resource your opponent. ""Destined Rivals"" is one of two ""Skill Drain""-like cards this deck has to offer, at the mere cost of controlling ""Dark Magician"". The card is searchable by most of the searchers in the deck, and is very useful when going first against a combo deck.  Buster Whelp: This simple engine allows for the second ""Skill Drain""-like effect, plus a few big monsters that can potentially wipe your opponent out in one shot. For the combo, all your require is ""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"". Normal summon ""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"" and use it's ability to add ""Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman"" from your deck to your hand and set it. Link summon ""Linkuriboh"" and end your turn. During your opponent's turn, activate your set ""Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman"" to send ""Buster Blader"" and ""Destruction Sword Memories"" from your deck to the GY, and chain the ability of ""Destruction Sword Memories"" in the GY, to banish ""Buster Blader"" and ""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"". When the chain resolves, this will summon both ""Buster Dragon"" and ""Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman"".  Weaknesses: ""Imperial Order"" and ""Anti-Spell Fragrance"" (the deck relies heavily on spells to search cards), destroying a face-up ""Eternal Soul"" (wipes your entire field), negating the firs few searches (the deck really needs to get rolling at the start otherwise it is hard to pick up the pace)."

Unlike ones we have seen like ""Tri-Brigade"", ""Salamangreat"", and ""Agents""; Swordsoul is not as bipolar with their options, and has a very straightforward arsenal. Does the TCG often call something straightforward a winning strategy with? No, not since 2008. However, ""Swordsoul/Xiangjian"" has the honor of being the first of its kind in years for this feat that decks like CHAOS control and TeleDAD has done in it's reign.  LV8 synchro monsters are played like they're going out of style for this deck; however if you are a charlatan (or haven't played in the Zexal era), you maybe familiar with the Draglubion package (TL;DR Number 97 is ranked and goes into either Number 38, or another XYZ Dragon that is also a Number monster). I'm not gonna take time to sugarcoat the rest for you because it is just as similar as the day it has been released in the OCG; but we get 3 ""Crossout Designator"", a banlist that is more of a nuance than a threat, and anything but Maxx ""C"". Also ""Pot of Desires"" is in there at 2 copies because it's a waste of resources playing 3 (my advice is to play ""Triple Tactics Talent"" over this if you want your Crossouts to have more targets to dispose)."

It pumps out fusions using either player's graveyard and has one linear combo line. But what if you wanted to play it pure? Well boy do it have some terrible news for you. Introducing the epitome of rage quits and mechaba pass, behold Chris Hansen Invoked (get it because they are ghost girls)! This utter mistake of a deck was inspired by DistantCoder's pure invoked deck but somehow I made it so much worse. In essence the deck is essentially just mechaba pass turbo but sometimes you open well and you can make double mechaba pass and overlay for VFD (when he was legal) or just skip mechaba outright and make Cocytus. The Chris Hansen part is the 22 loli handtraps that you can use to interrupt once you've used your mechaba negate. Ratios don't matter anymore and I side in dragoon and 3 cherries against dragoon decks. Just play whatever handtraps you want.  If you're that guy who played cydra with me in a tag duel you were a great partner."

Not to a Meta-degree, mind you, but they actually have a solid strategy that can become a huge headache for your opponents in duels. After paying a visit to HouseofCard's YT channel, gleaning some ideas and playtesting the deck, I have found his deck to be quite substantial for all of your cartoony shenanigan needs.  Basic idea: The ideal board is you with a Toon Kingdom in your field zone, adequate GY setup with a Toon Bookmark in there, and a beefy boss monster such as Toon Black Luster Soldier or Toon DM out, with a Toon Terror in your backrow because omni-negates are fun.  <strong>Go first or second? </strong>Always go <strong>second</strong>. Your deck is geared towards clearing house before you do anything substantial, plus the Dark Ruler No More cards/Nibirus are there to mess with players who summon a billion times on their turn. Plus, save for Toon BLS, Toons can't attack on the first turn they're summoned anyway. The idea is to wreck their board and resources on your turn, and go for the kill on your next.  <strong>Strategy: </strong>If going second, your opponent will likely have a substantial board. Judge first if any monsters there have <em>[Quick Effects] </em>that will disrupt your plays, ESPECIALLY negates. If so, slap a Dark Ruler No More down first. If your opponent has backrow, use a Lightning Storm to sweep them off.  You might think that this is where you start going hog wild with searches via Toon Bookmark/Toon Table of Contents, but be cautious. If you have Toon Kingdom, try baiting with that and see if your opponent tries to axe it. If they do, and you have a searcher, you can just fetch another. Then, try using Contents to bait out any Ash Blossom cards. Remember, Contents can be used more than once, but it's the Bookmark that'll hurt if they counter that with Ash Blossom.  If you start off with a Toon Table of Contents, the idea is to ALWAYS fetch Bookmark FIRST <em>(you want your GY to be prepared to save Toon Kingdom)</em> and then use that to search for Toon Kingdom. Or, if you have Kingdom already, Page-Flip. THIS is your playmaker right here.  When using Page-Flip, always go for the big three: Red-Eyes Toon Dragon, Toon Dark Magician, or Toon Black Luster Soldier. Two are easy field setup cards that can cheat out your boss monster <em>(the aforementioned Toon Black Luster Soldier) </em>while the latter is, at its strongest, an untargetable 3000 ATK beatstick with the ability to attack directly OR easy card removal. Ideally, the safest bet is Toon Dark Magician, since he can also fetch support as well.  Briefcase and Toon Terror are ideal for removing problem cards that your opponent may attempt to play to start dismantling your board. Please, for the love of God, do NOT use Briefcase flippantly or you will regret it, save it for a REALLY nasty monster that can lead to bad things happening to your side. Terror is there to stop effects from destroying or removing Toon Kingdom <em>(because part and parcel of playing Toons is, as Rank10YGO once put it, a game of 'Protect the Castle.')</em>  The Extra Deck is really there for a few reasons: Rank 7 plays to make your opponent's life as miserable as possible, Bahamut Shark/Toadally Awesome engine to accommodate the Toon Mermaids, a bunch of cards -in case- something goes wrong, but mostly, fodder for Prosperity's drawing effect. That said, remember to NEVER sack important cards like Number 11: Big Eye for that card's effect.  I've put some cards in the side deck that may come in handy. The Cyber Dragon engine may be a bit dated, but it still comes in handy for clutch plays. You MAY want to add an Instant Fusion &amp; Panzer Dragon in there, since sadly that's a small oversight that I made."

I've been curious about Appliancer archtype since i first saw Laundry Dragon card desing, but only today i went make a deck and, to my surprise, Appliancer is not a bad deck (pure is bad) :)  There's no secret in Appliancer, you summon Socketroll's and link summon as many link 1's you wish, this was what i thought, but after searching more i perceived that Appliancer is not limited only to his only archtype or type and can summon 4+ monster in a turn without locking you like other decks so, if you use Codebraker engine you can do some crazy stuff like make 2 link 4 in a turn.  The goal here is get 4 monster in the field to use the Codebraker combo and end with either Apollousa co-linked to a Knightmare Phoenix (first turn) or Accesscode Talker and Codebraker Virus Berserker for a Otk. But unfortunately appliancers have only 2 reliable monsters and don't have many ways to search them alone besides the field spell so sometimes you will only got spells that don't do nothing alone like Where arf Thou and no monster to use it, so to fill that hole in Appliancers i added a control layer in the deck.  But lets say that you have a good hand, with Parallel eXced and 2 Socketroll :), this is the combo: Normal summon Socketroll ~special summon your other Socketroll ~the first Socketroll activates it effect and special summon one more Socketroll ~link summon Celtopus ~Activate Parallel eXced from your hand and special summon another Parallel ~link summon Codebreaker Virus Swordsman using 2 non-link monsters and place Virus Swordsman in THE BOTTOM LINK MARKER OF CELTOPUS, be sure to not forget this ~Virus Swordsman special summon Codebreaker Zero Day ~link summon Codebreaker Virus Berserker using Swordsman and Zero day only, PLACE IT IN THE BOTTOM LINK MARKER OF CELTOPUS TOO ~Virus Berserker summon Swordsman and Zero day back to the field ~now you can chose your path according to your turn, if you are going first ~link summon Knightmare Unicorn using one of the link 2 and Zero Day ~link summon Accesscode Talker with Unicorn and the last link 2 ~wipe the board with Accesscode and won the game, if you are going first you will need to be more specific in what you gonna do because it requires you to ~Link summon Knightmare Phoenix using Virus with another Day Zero and place it in the BOTTOM LINK MARKER OF CELTOPUS, again, then link summon Apollousa using Celtopus and Virus Swordsman and PUT APOLLOUSA ON TOP OF PHOENIX this gives you 2 monster negates and Apollousa stay protected against battle. In this exemple i ended with 1 extra monster, when this happens you can include them to Apollousa link summoning to get more negates.  I was thinking about using Jester Cofit and Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians to have more consistency and a even easier link four.  Very funny deck.

This is the first deck I'm building after taking a long time off of the game. That being said, the extra and side decks will most likely be tweaked once I see how it runs.  My thought process is that the deck should be able to swarm a few gems fairly easily for fusion, xyz or synchro. It's mostly earth support, but has a few other options if the situation calls for it.

For those who don’t know the Magistus archetype is a series of level 4 spellcaster support with the gimmick of generating advantage through attaching monsters in the extra deck. Zoroa, the Magistus of Flames is a standout card in the archetype. He can special a level 4 spellcaster when he’s equipped with a magistus AND equip himself with a Magistus monster from the extra deck. He is great for simplifying  gamestates, extending plays, and the fact that he’s a level 4 tuner gives him huge versatility. In BODE we’re getting the new synchro Zoroa who can single-handedly lock your opponent out of the game. The Magistus although powerful don’t really have a way to get the ball rolling and start generating a lot of cards by themselves so they’re just begging to be paired with something powerful.  Pendulum Magicians are something powerful. In this deck the normal summon is already hugely impactful, and essentially being able to do it again with a pendulum summon gives combos near limitless potential while also providing a stable way to continually generate advantage once the cards are set up.  The charmers are in here because they make Zoroa plays much better. Awakening of the possessed is the absurd card in this set though. Both it’s effects are very strong, as 1850 monsters are readily available and we do play all 6 types. Think about it, 3 monsters with different types represent 2700 atk from  this card alone. This makes our end monsters beefy and you cant complain when you’re drawing an extra card every turn.  This deck can do some really cool different combos and put up a lot of interruption, sometimes through interruptions. It can also play the control game through cards like Time Pendulumgraph or just straight up lock your opponent out of the game with Archnemeses Protos or Secret Village. Every game feels fun, but sometimes I do feel sorry for the person on the receiving end.  Well that’s all, I hope you have fun, let me know how you like it."

It was a blind 2nd deck back then, and very inconsistent due to its lack of access to the field spell (people played foolish burial goods back then, just to indicate how desperate they were).  To my surprise, no one considers it a going 2nd deck any more after the new support, something which I consider very odd. It is the same deck as the one upon release, just much much much better.  <strong>Deck</strong> <ul>  	<li>3x @ignister pikachu: standard.</li>  	<li>3x @ignister charizard: standard.</li>  	<li>2x @ignister purple: quite standard. I say quite because some people play it at 1 with the obvious pros and cons. I like it at 2 because it is actually a really good card in hand and another copy comes in handy as well for the follow up turn.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister green: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister earth: standard (some people play the water lvl 1).</li>  	<li>1x @ignister gatchiri: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister danmari: standard.</li>  	<li>3x nibiru: one of my favourite cards in the deck. Some couple remarks below. <ul>  	<li>Blow out if resolves. Notice the use of security dragon to get it of your field.</li>  	<li>Suppose you have the link 6 on the field upon activation. The board clears but the link 6 stays because of unaffectedness.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>2x ash: -.</li>  	<li>1x pankratops: highly underrated imo. Do notice the conflict with transcode talker and AI meet you (does not come up much, but better safe than sorry).</li>  	<li>3x dark ruler no more: -.</li>  	<li>3x cynet mining: -.</li>  	<li>3x field spell + 1x terraform: -.</li>  	<li>3x AI meet you: -.</li>  	<li>2x AIdle reborn (including monster reborn: -.</li>  	<li>3x imperm: -.</li>  	<li>3x evenly: obviously insane. Do notice that you can use @ignister charizards 2nd effect to destroy your own monster in battle phase, to clear your half of the field to meet the cards activation requirement.</li>  	<li>1x red reboot: obviously insane, since wind pegasus is always a part of your combo for a backrow pop 4 which can't be stopped.</li> </ul> extra deck <ul>  	<li>3x dark infant: notice my endboard below why I play so many.</li>  	<li>1x link spider: in case you get nibirud.</li>  	<li>1x cyberse wicckid: standard.</li>  	<li>1x security dragon: to get your own nibiru of the field. Also just a really nice card to bounce windas, big tokens of whatever in case you really have to.</li>  	<li>2x splash mage: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister dark templar: standard.</li>  	<li>1x transcode talker: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister fire phoenix: to search @ignister charizard.</li>  	<li>1x firewall dragon: see endboard below.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister arrival cyberse: standard.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister light dragon: one of, if not the, most underrated card in the deck. Non targeting pop, build in protection, and revival effect during battle phase. Allows you to OTK against empty boards.</li>  	<li>1x @ignister wind pegasus: standard. DONT forget its second effect in graveyard, absolute killing.</li> </ul> <strong>Endboard</strong>  requirements: <ul>  	<li>1,5 card combo</li>  	<li>Any of the following: @ignister pikachu, charizard, purple, field spell, AIdle reborn, cynet mining</li> </ul> board (GOING 2ND remember): <ul>  	<li>4 card backrow pop</li>  	<li>3 card non targeting monster pop</li>  	<li>board <ul>  	<li>@ignister link 6 in extra monster zone with 4K ATK</li>  	<li>firewall dragon below it (2x co-linked)</li>  	<li>dark infant @ignister to the right of firewall dragon</li>  	<li>omni negate in graveyard from @ignister danmari</li>  	<li>shuffle back from @ignister wind pegasus</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Final comments</strong>  I want to tell a lot more about the card choices I made, the combos, etc, but I don't have the space nor time to do so.  Maybe the big takeway is that @ignister was a blind 2nd deck on release, and it still is now but just much better.  Also realize that this build is <strong>NOT</strong> designed to OTK, let me emphasize this clearly (hence 3x dark ruler, 3x evenly). The idea is more that no matter the matchup, whether this is combo or backrow or stun, you have very generic outs to all these decks. If you do play against a slow deck, then red reboot / evenly / @ignister wind pegasus should be a blow out, while if you play against combo, the nibirus, dark rulers, pankratops are all very nice.  I hope that you guys enjoy my build! I Worked quite hard on it, with quite some playtesting, and I genuinely believe that going 2nd decks do have something unique to offer, in particular this archetype.  Cheers,  Adriaan"

I aim to make a Frightful - Despia or something like that in my next deck.  As i said before, Despia is a generic fusion archtype, and being generic means that they have someway to search themselvesv and can fusion summon monsters outside his own archetype, the first requirement is easily filled with Despia Opening, Aluber the Jester of Despia and Despian tragedy all these three cards can search Despia cards, for the second requirement you have the field spell that is a searchable fusion gate and the fusion monsters (the field spell alone already justitfy using a 5-7 card engine).  The pattern combo is fusion summon something using Dramaturge of Despia to special summon Dramaturge from the gy and get +1, you can attain this with many combinations of cards like Aluber+Opening, Dramaturge+Opening, Dramaturge + Aluber, etc...  I don't have much more to explain, you just need to read them one time and try to do what ive said.  &nbsp;  GLHF"

It's important to go into the Sheou early for the omni negate both for protection and also because when you either normal the rokket synchron or use the rokket tracer effect it locks you into darks and therefore out of Sheou. Your combo hands  are very dependant on your opening hand, and this deck does brick a little more than either pure maids or dragon link, but the fact that you can end on three negates two bounces a +1 during your opponents standby going first and break any board with less than three or four negates going second make it worth playing imo.  I think there's a lot of play in the ratios of specifically the dragonmaid spell and trap cards because they're as searchable as they are, so in games two and three you can bring in say three nibiru over either a chaos space or a noctovision, a hospitality, and a tidying and still have enough gas to out grind most opponents because of the repeatability of your dragonmaid monsters. It's also very important to have a critical mass of lights and darks in your deck so you could potentially find room for a skull meister in the side over the lancea if tri-brigade gets hit at some point."

(Recommended for online simulator play only)","A Darklord variant that seeks to abuse powerful cards like ""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS- Sky Thunder"" and ""Diviner of the heralds"" in order to make up for their own inconsistencies and lack of an end board. The deck uses many drawing cards, like ""Allure of Darkness"" and ""Trade-In"" to cycle through the deck and set up the graveyard for the standard combos, discussed below:  The deck seeks to put either 2 level 8 or level 10 monsters on the board in order to quickly rank up multiple times, ending on a ""Number 77: The Seven Sins"" which can then attack and go in a Zeus capable of multiple effect uses in a single turn.  The setup done can also mean many more Zeus' in later turns, thanks to the Darklord cards. ""Darklord Superbia"" is a key card in this deck, allowing you to special any fairy from grave when special summoned from grave. The 6 cards included in the deck that can special it from grave are ""World legacy succession"", ""Monster reborn"" and ""Darklord contact"", which can be searched by your 3 copies of ""Banishment of Darklords"". The normal combo includes ""Darklord Ixchel"", ""Diviner of the herald"" and any of the 6 grave revival cards mentioned, preferably ""Monster reborn"" or ""Contact"". Normal summon ""Diviner"" and send ""Superbia"". Diviner becomes lvl 10. Then use ""Ixchel"" to pitch herself and another Darklord card from your hand to grave, then use the revival card on ""Superbia"" to summon it and then ""Ixchel"" from grave. It's recommended at this point, to use ""Ixchel's"" monster effect, which pays 1000LP to target and copy a ""Darklord"" S/T in your GY and apply it's effect, and then shuffle it into the deck. It's worth noting that using a Darklord monster effect to copy ""Contact"" and special ""Superbia"" will cause it to miss timing, essentially wasting the effect. Use it on ""Banishment"" if you can. Then summon ""Number 35"", Rank up into ""Number 84"" and finish on ""Number 77"" and attack, finishing with a 5-mat Zeus. If you go for ""Dingirsu"" with level 8s instead, just repeat the same thing.  *Important to note*  If you summoned ""Indulged Darklord"" in the same turn you wish to summon and use ""Zeus"" or ""Dingirsu"", you cannot use their effects as they lock you into DARK fairy effects for the rest of the turn. Darklord monster that pay 1000 to copy S/T effects in grave can only be special summoned once per turn, a clause that hurts the normal ""Darklord"" strategy. You can also summon ""Forbidden Maiden"" and search ""Droplets"", then use it for link mat for ""Condemned Darklord"" which can provide alternate ways to set up your graveyard for the combo. The lack of a side deck is due to the fact that it typically goes 2cnd, seeing as it literally can not do anything impactful turn one, so just put generic going second cards in there and feel free to switch them out for ""Droll and Lock bird"" and the forbidden cards."

How fast I am? I'm fast as fuck BOIIIIIIIIIIIII!,"By the time you read this article, FA Hang On Mach will have been banned for crimes against humanity. and also being a floodgate.  Do you Skate fast? Do you summon Stardust Dragon /Assault Mode? Is your sole goal in Yu-Gi-Oh to style on your opponent as hard as possible? Well, FA Speedroid is absolutely dripping with 90's energy, and may be the deck for you. Boasting a 3-2 record in cup, this deck is proven to be at least as good as Sonic 3d Blast, that is to say a solid 6/10 but beloved by many. <h2>Gameplan:</h2> It goes without saying that this deck's gameplan is to Synchro Summon, we are running an incredibly loaded tuner in Auto Nav, and are also running Psi-Reflector and Speedroid engines so we can Synchro Summon <em>even more. </em>A large part of what sets this list apart from other Synchro-Focused decks, is a combination of flexibility in the synchros we can make, thanks to FA level modulation, as well as a strong recursivness in our plays, thanks to the GY effects of cards such as Auto Nav, Pit-Stop, Test Run, and even Speedroid Den-Den-Daiko-Duke. <h2>Combos:</h2> As alluded to by the aforementioned flexibility, this deck can do many things with any given hand. Here I will list a few solid options to get you started. It should be noted that any combination of Auto Nav + Field Spell, or UA Hyper Stadium + a UA or an FA is your most common starter, and can pivot in to nearly anything the deck makes <h4>Garden Rose Flora:</h4> Garden Rose Flora is a relatively new card, and the end point of the deck's safest and most generally applicable combo. From Nav + Field, you do the following: <ol>  	<li> Normal Summon Auto Nav</li>  	<li>Add UA Hyper Stadium (Which is always treated as an FA card) if you did not already have it, otherwise add an FA Field of your choice (Situational, another Hyper Stadium is the safest, but you can also a ""true"" FA field for step 6)</li>  	<li> Add a Level 4 FA or UA with the effect of Hyper Stadium (There are slight implications to which you choose, but any completes the combo)</li>  	<li>Use the second effect of Hyper Stadium for an extra Normal Summon</li>  	<li>Synchro Summon Garden Rose Flora</li>  	<li>You can optionally activate another ""true"" FA field here in order to get it's search effect by popping it with Flora.</li>  	<li>Pop your field with Flora for the Level 2 Rose Token, You can take your FA search here if applicable, Pit Stop, Test Run, and Hyper Stadium are generally good searches</li>  	<li>In your opponent's Main Phase, after they have passed their priority, you can flex in to ANY synchro 7, Typically FA Dawn Dragster or Black Rose Moonlight Dragon.</li> </ol> This same line can be achieved with Hyper Stadium + a Level 4 by searching Auto Nav with Stadium, and then continuing from step 4. <h4>FA Motorhome Transport:</h4> Because sometimes you just need a big, hard to out stick. This combo starts the same way as the Garden Rose Flora Combo, but must have access to a Level 4 FA and One of the two FA fields that increase level in Main Phase Specifically, Preferably City Grand Prix.

This deck takes advantage of Normal Monsters to get around the Summon Limit and pull off powerful combos an,"This list is one that I've been pretty dedicated to regarding Trinity and only continues to be optimized and improved with each banlist change, taking in the little side adjustments to make it better. While the deck has plenty of resources and ways of going about building it, this setup is the baseline for what I consider to be a pretty effective start for a Trinity ""World Chalice"" Deck centered around the aforementioned archetype.  <span><strong>Pros:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span>Non-linear Midgame</span>: This makes disruption windows and timing very frustrating for your opponent, especially since any two monsters usually can convert into a lot more than what they might've been expecting. You can really take someone off guard by just bringing out cards in your Extra Deck that weren't shown off before, for example: the Rasterliger who often takes so many games from my opponents just because it's a ""free, budget Accesscode.""</li>  	<li><span>Strong Starts</span>: Since this deck operates around combo theories, your openers will usually be some form of disruption that doubles as a means of putting out 2-3 bodies and setting up modes of revival for follow-up plays. If you happen to be unlucky, you can still end on 2-3 bodies, or just the Berserker and be content sometimes; though, engine access is prefered.</li>  	<li><span>Explosive Combos</span>: The combo lines in this deck get pretty crazy pretty quickly, just after 1 resolution of Lib, Ib, or Chalice in the Graveyard. The 2nd search pretty much opens up a vast amount of lines that often makes the deck difficult to pilot, especially in the way of disruption and/or adversity.</li> </ul> <span><strong>Cons:</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><span>Normal Monsters</span>: These guys do have the major downside of not being a handtrap, having innate effects, or being super valuable in a topdeck scenario as they still just are vanillas. While opening several in the same hand usually is a combo line thanks to Imduk, there are often times where just having too few or too many Normals can make hands seriously clunky, especially with no extenders and/or follow-up.</li>  	<li><span>Openers Are Everything</span>:  Not opening correctly or getting yourself on the map with this deck will put you pretty far behind in Modern Trinity; though, that's kind of a thing to be said regarding just about every strong deck in the format. You'll need to take your best discretion regarding the best opener for the given matchup and consider the direction the game might go, ESPECIALLY if you're going 2nd.</li>  	<li><span>Summon Limit</span>: While the Summon Limit often will be the thing we're exploiting with this list, it's important to always keep it in mind as it is still the limiting factor and the monsters being used for the combo lines aren't exactly the beefiest to end on like a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Plan your lines and alternative pivots accordingly, else you might find yourself just making a Berserker of the Tenyi and passing, or much, much worse.</li> </ul> Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.  <hr /> <p><span><strong>OPENERS</strong></span></p> The hand quality and/or number of extenders in the hand will always make the permuations of the gamestates more or less challenging to emulate; though, this much was obvious. That being said, in the 1st turns of the duel, you ideally want to get your engines rolling. This can be enabled by the following: <ul>  	<li><strong>Link Summoning Halqibrax as Summon 3 or Lower:</strong> The less summons used, the more things you can get done along the way, for example: making Ib and using her as material for Halqi so you can Special Summon a World Chalice Monster in addition to Halqi's on-summon effect. If you have an excess summon, it's best to just summon the handtrap Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit, as she doubles as a potential disruption while face-up on the field. If not, Guardragon Justicia will suffice. Just be mindful to try and keep at least 1 copy in the deck at all times if you can afford to because of Carboneddon. Draconnet falls under this category as well, but is less dependant on Justicia as we have Crowned as a back-up.</li>  	<li><strong>Link Summoning I:P Masquerena using Ib:</strong> This will allow you to summon Lee, the World Chalice Fairy from the deck, add either Guardragon or World Legacy - ""World Chalice"" to hand, and during the opponent's turn, simply make a Knightmare Unicorn or Phoenix based on the situation. Discard the added card to provide yourself with follow-up during your turn and disrupting the opponent at the same time, making the cost to discard a positive rather than a negative. Alternatively, if you can afford to hold said Chalice that was added via the Lee, being able to Tribute Summon it on the following turn allows you to use Lee in the GY to send it away and trigger the effect to Special 2 World Chalice monsters from the deck, all in 1 Summon (assuming you summon 2 Normal Monsters).</li>  	<li><strong>Imduk Double Summon a ""World Chalice"" / Special Summon into Tribute Summon ""World Chalice:""</strong> While the latter method of Special Summoning first is preferred (via something like Emergency Teleport for example), it's not always going to be an option with the baseline build. If you can pull it off, you have probably successfully FTK'd your opponent, unless they're able to blow you out somehow. Since this is the ideal scenario, let's look at the former instead. The Imduk Double Summon will put you on 2 Summons. If you DID NOT open a 2nd World Chalice Normal Monster in the hand, then it makes Tributing over Imduk even more costly as removing the World Chalice will require going into Almiraj, which will default the play to walling up with some Crowned or just settling for Berserker and passing. Remember, you want to get World Chalice to resolve and put it in the GY. It's fine to settle for less if it means you're still pushing your engine along. If you do happen to have a 2nd Normal in the hand, then upon floating the Imduk away as a Tribute Summon, you can Special that Normal Monster, make LANphorhyncus, then go into Lib, setting up a dangerous follow-up and Link-4 play.</li> </ul> Recognizing any of the above situations to be possible within the first turn you can play is vital to a powerful opener across almost every build of a ""World Chalice"" focused deck. If you're able to pull off these gamestates, you can definitely snowball the advantage and keep up with the viable decks in the format (usually anyway). <p><span><strong>MIDGAME</strong></span></p> The permutations midgame are far too complex to jot down here and vary based on your Extra Deck line-up (mainly the Link Monsters and Synchro 6-10 options you slotted in). I'll just highlight the star players to look for so you can get a general idea of the sequences you'll want to run through. <ul>  	<li><strong>Looping Lib: </strong>Resolving this card once in Trinity is strong on its own. Resolving both effects can be game-winning (or swinging). Resolving the search effect twice or more in a single duel can be a death sentence. The World Legacy cards can be extremely high-value, and so long as Trap Globe remains in the deck, you have the ability to go well beyond the average grind games of similar combo-based strategies. Just try not to be too greedy with Lib. This isn't a goodstuff deck, so you can't settle for ""good enough."" You gotta make that search count everytime. If it's not potentially game-winning that turn or next turn, then it's probably a misplay to grab it.</li>  	<li><strong>World Legacy Discovery has Text: </strong>People forget this all the time and it's honestly so hilarious. Your monsters can and will replace themselves (once per turn) under this Field Spell, even if they are bounce and/or banished. Just being sent to the GY can also just make them be revived instead, which is great for Lee in particular, allowing you to trigger the search effect during the opponent's push. I usually aim to set this up as a 3rd search target when going for a risky play into multiple backrow or disruptions, since if at any point the line would be interrupted with World Chalice mons, I can still recover and keep pushing. Don't underestimate this card!</li>  	<li><strong>The Extra Deck is Everything:</strong> This is still semi-highlander, so treat your Extra Deck Monsters like their lives and plays are vital to your chances of closing the game out. You don't want to waste a bullet or opportunity to win just for a Link Climb, even if the monster has no effect (like LAN and Berserker). You want to properly access what card is the best for the job and will get the best push and use it accordingly. During anything extra will likely have you relying on top decking the unsearchable Pots as a means of a crutch. Make those combos count!</li> </ul> Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame; however, if they don't, you always have the fallback options within the lategame. <p><strong><span>LATEGAME</span></strong></p>  <ul>  	<li><strong>Rasterliger:</strong> This is just Accesscode talker in the deck and should be treated accordingly. It's best to summon this by using I:P as a material since it would make it protected to help with the push.</li>  	<li><strong>Draco Masters of the Tenyi:</strong> Since we play a lot of Normal Monsters and 2 Non-Effect Links, this card in the lategame should be Raigeki. Honestly, it's probably Raigeki even as early as turn 2-3, but it's good to keep this for when you need it rather than just as a random blowout. This isn't a combo enabler or extender after all and its protection isn't actually that great.</li>  	<li><strong>World Legacy Collapse:</strong> If you haven't used this card for the GY effect or are just setting up cheeky lethal somehow, you can always use this in tandem with Lance or Armor in order to pump up a Link Monster in the Damage Step (<em>permanently</em>). This is a good way to clean up leftover LP in grindier games and should be used more as a Trump rather than a gameplan.</li>  	<li><strong>World Legacy - ""World Lance"": </strong>Maintain this in hand until the time is right, OR sit on that Crescendo in the GY and wait until the opponent locks themselves into an attack duruing their turn (usually it will be into one of the Link-2 or higher monsters during this stage of the game). In response to the attack, search out the Lance, then during the Damage Step, discard the Lance and finish them off with their own attack. ;P Works every time.</li> </ul>  <hr />  As you can probably see from the above, the deck has a lot of options and different ways of navigating even the more ""simple"" gamestates or setups. Sometimes even the above cirumstances aren't considered optimal due to a given gamestate and I often find myself slotting out the Extra Deck based on changing trends in a given format. That said, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere: <p><span><em>Accesscode Talker, Mekk-Knight Core, Orcust Core, Guardragon Promineses, World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke, Adamancipator Risen - Dragite, Tenyi Core, Magikey Core, Piercing the Light, Pacifis</em></span></p> <p>Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! It's a lot of fun to pilot, theorycraft, innovate, and watch replays on. If you can put in the time to learn it and cater the Extra Deck to be yours, it's well worth the ride. Now, cheers to the Chalice!</p>"

Okay, so right now I think Necrovalley is generally a better floodgate than Zombie World, but Zombie World is also pretty good rn, and will be better very soon with the release of Flunders, since you're essentially running 11 Mask of Restrict in archetype that also still hates on other meta strategies. Zombies is a nice shell for control, because you have built-in recursion and the ability to take incredible advantage of Rivalry of Warlords in a way no other deck can, and Super Poly, again in a way few decks can.  So, for essential Zombie cards, I'm going pretty hard on Zombie World. There are a whole 3 copies and Terrraforming, which is obligatory. Necroworld Banshee is a 3 of in my opinion, so want to be able to normal summon this in a pinch, you want to send it from your hand with Uni-Zombie, and most importantly you want a Zombie monster you can activate at spell-speed 2 for Balerdroch that doesn't go to far out of your way. That last part makes it worth running 3, especially since the deck is pretty reliant on Zombie World to get its game on. 2 Glow-Up Bloom, occasionally seeing these is good, these are easy access to Balerdroch or Golden Lord, usually Balerdroch since you'll have Zombie World on the field. 1 Mezuki, this is just a nice little bit of recursion that also activates Balerdroch, admittedly a little slow but still useful to have another way to activate Balerdroch that nets you value. We have 2 Shiranui Solitaire and 3 Uni-Zombie. You'd always rather just have the zombie than a searcher, and you only really want to see 1 of these, but you do want to see 1 of these, so 5 is the perfect number. Trust me, you think six is a good idea, and then you clog Uni-Zombies. 2 Balerdroch, you have lots of easy access to this in the deck, so you only need 2. 2 Golden Lord. The Special Summon from the hand while returning to the hand is actually relevant in this deck, but really it is here for a spot of in-engine removal. Still, it is a great beatstick and it activates Balerdroch while non targeting sending something to the GY, I'm seeing non-Zombie decks play this and if you were really looking to break boards you could even run 3, but my gut tells me 2 is the right number. 1 Vampire Fraulein. If you're new to Zombies you might wonder why people play this card, it is basically an OTK enabler, helps close out games while being a battle-phase hand trap. Yeah, the card isn't that pushed, but pushing in for an extra 3000 damage is too good to pass up. You only need 1, we don't want to see this all the time, we just want it around. Super Poly is basically a Zombie card, you use this to summon Dragonecro with 2 of your opponent's monsters, which is pushed. Rivalry is also basically a Zombie card since it combined with Zombie world locks people out of summoning non-zombie monsters if they control a monster, a powerful ""combo"". 3 Pot of Extravagence, I think this deck needs raw card advantage more than consistency, and it doesn't care about its extra deck that much. 1 Foolish Burial, this is your last copy of Zombie World but also more access to Balerdroch and Mezuki, as well as sending Glow-Up Bloom for Balerdroch. That left room for a reasonable suite of generic interruption. Droplets is a staple for a reason, and we're a GY deck, so 3 of these seem really obligatory. Evenly Matched seems pretty good right now with Tri being one of the best decks, if not the best deck, in the format, and it handles a lot of the midrange decks that are more powerful in the meta right now. It is also just a card with a proven pedigree, in Zombie decks in particular, so I wanted 2 in the main. That left 4 cards. I like the power of the Solemn Strike/Torrential Tribute ""Combo"" wherein they need a countertrap to save their board - we have the tools to deal with the creatures protected from these cards, so this seems reasonable. It also works in conjunction with Evenly Matched to clear away Backrow and deal with monsters, I mean, it just seems solid, solid enough that in some matchups I may want the third copy of any of these cards, or all of them, and have them in the side.  You need Linkuriboh for Glow-Up Bloom and we run Extravagence so we have 3 Linkuriboh. Avendread Saviour and Vampire Sucker are cards you go into regularly, and you may even want multiple Suckers in a game, so we're for sure on 3 of each of these in an Extravagence deck. Verte Anaconda could come up some time, but I'm fine running 1. Dragonecro, on the other hand, is a card you might make multiple copies of in a game if you don't banish it, a clear 3 of. Starving Venom is obligatory in Super Poly deck, but I also like Triphoverytium (or whatever, the 3 darks monster) because it is actually common enough to make 3 darks, or to make 2 darks and for me to be able to make Verte Anaconda, send Super Poly.  Side deck. First few cards are for backrow matchups. Shared Ride is for going first anywhere Droll is good. Different Dimension Ground is essentially a turn skip, and these 2 cards overlap in a lot of matchups. When you're going second you instead go for board breaking cards and backrow removal as necessary. Torrential and Solemn Strike contribute to these plans, being cards that are good going second as well as going first. Solemn Judgement is your anti-backrow removal card - you basically should be running this game 2 to 3 to protect your traps and your Zombie World from the influx of backrow removal.  I decided to run Ice Dragon's Prison over D D G, since with Zombie World on the field its grave hate that is also a huge blow-out, a little more reactive rather than being a temporary floodgate, but IMO still often a turn-stopper, and useful in the same matchups as D D G thanks to Zombie World.  So, I decided Evenly was a little weak going first in this deck, so it became the backrow removal in the side to focus on the more flexible TT + SS combo. That opened up some space in the side deck - I already has Ice Dragon's Prison as a GY hate, normally restricted to use against Tribal deck but really good in a Zombie World deck as generic GY hate. I also already had Shared Ride, to put the hurt on searching, and Solemn Judgement to shut down to backrow removal on a flexible card that answers any threat that would hit the table. The deck is good at putting up a couple high-quality interruptions, and Zombie World and Rivalry of Warlords gives us a low of floodgates. Between our answers, Drytron and Tri-Bri are covered really well, and so is Rokkets. Virtual World and Prank Kids is my next concern. I feel like Virtual World is covered pretty well by Shared Ride and Evenly Matched along with board breakers. That leaves Prank Kids as the matchup that needs the most coverage. I felt like having some Twin Twisters to go with the Evenly Matched would improve this matchup, while generically being useful against the midrange and fast control decks that are popping up as rogue decks right now. That left one space for one card, and I decided to run a lone copy of DRNM, so we can play games going second. If we only have space for a 1 of, I want it to be impactful when I do see it, because it won't show up enough to be the swing in the matchup on its own, and I like it as the redundant ""4th"" copy of Droplet."

There's access to desert locusts into Baroness De Fleur for a hand-rip and a negate off a stray Needlefiber (this is unironically better than using a level 4 non-tuner, Needlefiber and an extra for 3 material Apollousa)  If you can find a Hex-Sealed to put on field off an Adamancipator, you can use one of the many ways to set up a monster negate to completely shut your opponent out of monster effects for the turn using Caliga, with the best option being Millennium-Eyes, which prevents your opponent from Summoning something with 1900+ attack and swinging over Caliga. If you can find Hex-Sealed and mill a Gamma off of Chaos Ruler, you can use any other monsters on board for Lambda to shut your opponent off monsters.  You lose to almost any spell card if you don't draw Order, but if you are good at Yu-Gi-Oh, you would either draw order every time, or you wouldn't be playing Hex-Sealed Fusion in 2021.  Side deck is subject to change I just kinda threw things in there.  Don't Bother too much making Dragite live turn one, Baroness off of Needlefiber Locust combo just does it's job better, it's there for going second."
