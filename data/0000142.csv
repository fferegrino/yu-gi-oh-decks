Note for my build, some of the cards aren't officially out yet.  Some of the biggest issues with the deck are with consistency, not many monster effect negates, board control, or pump out big beaters to get over stuff. When playing the deck you want to play more defensive and more control based. I made the deck as a mix going 1st and going 2nd. As in having options while going 1st or 2nd. So in my build, I decided to tech 2 cards (Evenly Match and XYZ Import). And my extra deck has few board control options like Evilswarm Exciton Knight and Castle. But I will explain more about this deck while going on.  <strong>Monsters (19):</strong>  <strong>3x Ash Blossom</strong> - Standard Hand Trap. You need some sort of hand trap nowadays, too many can be cloggy so currently, Ash Blossom is one of the safest ones to main.  <strong>3x Time Thief Regulator</strong> - I recommend trying to bait out <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> before summoning this guy 1st. This guy has 2 jobs for you, when he is normal to summon, you can tribute him while you have no monster to special summon 2 <strong>Time Thief</strong> monsters from your deck. I recommend for your targets to be <strong>Winder</strong> and <strong>Adjuster</strong>. Both of their effects will kick up once you summon them. It also has a GY effect where if your XYZ monster was destroyed by battle you can special summon it from the grave but it is banished when it leaves the field.  <strong>3X Time Thief Winder</strong> - He is practically the Stratos for this deck, he can search out <strong>Time Thief</strong> cards and I would recommend using his effect to search out <strong>Time Thief Retrograde </strong>or <strong>Flyback. </strong>You can also special summon him from your hand by detecting materials from a <strong>Time Thief</strong> XYZ.  <strong>2x Time Thief Chronocorder</strong> - I would recommend running 1 or 2 copies. It has a graveyard effect that can special summon itself when your XYZ (partially <strong>Redoer</strong>) leaves the field with its own effect.  <strong>3 x Time Thief Adjuster </strong>- She can easily special summon herself if you normal or special summon a <strong>Time Thief</strong> monster and has a ""<strong>Foolish Burial</strong>"" effect that can dump any <strong>Time Thief</strong> card in the grave. I would recommend using her effect to dump <strong>Chronocorder</strong> or <strong>Bezel Ship</strong> in the grave but heavily recommend using it to dump Time <strong>Thief Startup/Time Thief Flyback</strong> in the grave using her effect. Since these cards have graveyard effects.  <strong>1x Time Thief Bezel Ship</strong> - I would recommend running 1 or 2 of this guy. It can special summon itself from the grave by removing <strong>XYZ</strong> material from a <strong>Time Thief XYZ</strong> but it banishes itself after it leaves the field.  For this deck, I am running a <strong>""Performage"" </strong>Engine.  <strong>1x Performage Damage Juggler </strong>- I recommend foolish burial him and either get <strong>Trick Clown</strong> or <strong>Hat Tricker</strong> to hand but if you draw into him you can still normal summon him or use him as a hand trap to not take damage.  <strong>1x Performage Trick Clown </strong>- one the best stall,<strong> Foolish Burial</strong> target and <strong>XYZ</strong> material card, his effect is ""If this card is sent to the GY: you can target 1 ""Performage"" monster in your GY: Special Summon it, but its ATK/DEF become 0, then you take 1000 damage 1000 damage. You can only use this effect of ""Performage Trick Clown"" once per turn. I love this guy in my Lightsworns build but he is also handy here especially since you are trying to get into rank 4 XYZs. You can detach him as XYZ material and his effects still go off.  <strong>2x Performage Hat Tricker</strong> - One of the good Performage monsters even when you go 2nd. It special summon itself if there are more than 2 monsters on the field, so if you go 2nd, you can just special summon him easily and not lose your normal summon that turn.  <strong>Spells (12):</strong>  <strong>1x Instant Fusion</strong> - It is an extender to help get out your XYZ or even link plays. I am using this summon <strong>Darkfire Dragon</strong> to kick off XYZ plays.  <strong>1x Foolish Burial</strong> - you have a few Foolish Burial targets in this deck such as <strong>Trick Clown</strong>, <strong>Damage Juggler</strong>, <strong>Regulator</strong>, <strong>Chronocorder,</strong> and <strong>Bezel.</strong>  <strong>1x Monster Reborn</strong> and <strong>1x Called by the Grave</strong> - They are good generic staples to have in hand.  <strong>2x Time Thief Startup</strong> - I mostly use it for its GY effect but it also works as a double summon to help to get <strong>""Time Thief""</strong> monsters on board for XYZ plays. Its GY is written as ""During your Main Phase: You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 ""Time Thief"" XYZ Monster you control: attach 3 ""Time Thief"" cards of different types (1 Monster, 1 Spell, and 1 Trap) from your GY to that monster as Material"". You can search this card using <strong>Winder</strong> or dump it in grave using <strong>Adjuster</strong>  <strong>1x Time Thief Hack</strong> - you don't have to run this card, but for my build, it is helpful to get over stuff or finish for the game. It also gives a protection effect for your ""Time Thief"" monsters during the turn they are summoned, they can't be destroyed by your opponent's card effects. This helps especially if you are going 2nd. You can even attack directly using its effect if you already have your opponent's material as XYZ material and give a 300 attack boost per material that is attached. I would recommend running 1 and it is searchable.  <strong>2x XYZ Import</strong> - This is a good going 1st card, especially if you know your opponent has to start their play with a monster that has less than your XYZ monster, most of the time you are going to start out with Redoer either way so anything less than 2400 ATK that your opponent controls will turn into an XYZ material. If you do it right, you can pretty much stop anything your opponent do for the turn.  <strong>2x Pot of Disparity</strong> - I generally prefer this card over Desires (especially since most decks do run <strong>Ash</strong>) or Extravagance. Because you get to control what you are banishing, from your extra deck and try to dig out what card you need especially if you going for games 2/3 where you are trying to search out your key side deck card. Its Duality effect doesn't restrict special summoning which is important on turn 1. If you don't want to banish anything or want more draw power, I strongly suggest <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong> 12 Dark Monsters, over something like Desires. I generally am against running Desires because Ash exists and also if you run decks that have a lot of darks or need cards in the grave.  <strong>1x Pot of Avarice</strong> - You are going to need to recycle all your monsters, XYZs or not. It can be cloggy running multiply so running 1 is good enough.  <strong>Traps (11)</strong>  <strong>3x Time Thief Retrograde</strong> - This card is your Spell and Trap shield and turns your opponent spell/trap into XYZ material.  <strong>3x Time Thief Flyback</strong> - You can stuff your opponent's GY cards if it is set as material if it is in the grave or stuff cards from your deck into Time Thief XYZ Monsters.  <strong>2x The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</strong> - It is a trap monster that can be used for rank 4 XYZ, if you don't have traps in your grave on your 1st turn, you can activate him right away.  <strong>3x Evenly Matched</strong> - One of the best board wipes in the game and with Redoer's effect, you can easily use him on your turn if you have nothing field. And it is one of the best cards especially going 2nd. This card single handly will make Hero's player rage quit after they set up their board because of their lower monster count, take care of annoying unbreakable boards, etc.  <strong>Extra deck (15)</strong>  <strong>1x Darkflare Dragon</strong> - you only have him for <strong>Instant Fusion</strong> target or banish for <strong>Pot of Disparity</strong><strong> </strong>if you want. You just it for that necessarily filler.  <strong>2x Time Thief Redoer </strong>- He is basically the boss monster for this deck and he is also a generic rank 4 that you can splash around in other decks. His effects read as  ""Once per turn, during the Standby Phase: You can attach the top card of your opponent's Deck to this card as material. (Quick Effect): You can detach up to 3 different types of materials from this card, then apply the following effect(s) depending on what was detached. <div class=""os-padding""> <div class=""os-viewport os-viewport-native-scrollbars-invisible unselectable""> <div class=""os-content selectable os-textarea"">● Monster: Banish this card until the End Phase. ● Spell: Draw 1 card. ● Trap: Place 1 face-up card your opponent controls on the top of the Deck. You can only use this effect of ""Time Thief Redoer"" once per turn.""</div> </div> <div>The goal for this deck is to stuff cards into him either from your opponent's side or yours and using his effects to draw cards, banish itself to not get destroyed, or place a face-up back on top of the deck.</div> </div> <div><strong>2x - Time Thief Perpetual</strong> - She has 2 good effects, during each standby phase she can stuff cards into <strong>Redoer</strong>, <strong>Doublebarrel</strong>, or another copy of herself. You can use her effect to special summon Time Thief monsters from the grave as well.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x - Time Thief Doublebarrel</strong> - I would also recommend a 2nd copy but 1 is good enough because you need stuff cards in him instead of something natural like <strong>Redoer</strong> can do. But his effects are worth it. Because he can turn into mind control or negate the effect a monster your opponent controls on the field. His effects read as:</div> <div> <div class=""os-padding""> <div class=""os-viewport os-viewport-native-scrollbars-invisible unselectable""> <div></div> <div class=""os-content selectable os-textarea"">""When your opponent activates a card or effect (Quick Effect): You can detach up to 3 different types of materials from this card, then apply the following effect(s) depending on what was detached. ● Monster: This card gains 400 ATK. ● Spell: Take control of 1 face-up monster your opponent controls until the End Phase, but it cannot declare an attack or activate its effects this turn. ● Trap: Negate the effects of 1 Effect Monster on the field until the end of this turn. You can only use this effect of ""Time Thief Doublebarrel"" once per turn.""</div> </div> <div></div> <div><strong>2x Castel</strong> - a decent rank 4 to go into and helps to get certain cards on the field</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Evilswarm Exciton Knight</strong> - He is one of the best rank 4 board wipes to get out</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Evilswarm Nightmare</strong> - Since you run a lot of dark attribute monsters, you can easily get this guy out to book your opponent monster, if they are running stuff like ""Sky Strikers or heavy on the Link"" he is useless but most decks, he is still good putting some board controls.</div> </div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Abyss Dweller</strong> - Graveyard is like a 2nd hand, you can shut down your Opponent's second hand.</div> </div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x I:P Masquerena, Pheonix, Unicorn</strong> - Generic links that are good go-to.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</strong> - ""Unaffected by other monsters' effects, except those of Xyz Monsters. Cannot be destroyed by battle, except with an Xyz Monster. You can target 1 Xyz Monster in your GY and 1 card your opponent controls; Special Summon that monster from your GY, and if you do, attach that opponent's card to it as material, also for the rest of this turn, any damage your opponent takes is halved. You can only use this effect of ""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"" once per turn."" This card is great for XYZ heavy decks and also a 4k beater to get over your opponent's monsters.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>Side Deck (15)</strong></div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Nibiru</strong> - for those heavy Special Summon and spam decks.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Gamma + 1x Driver</strong> - a good hand trap option especially if you are going 2nd.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Dimensional Fissure</strong> - You can run Dimensional Fissure as a possible floodgate. Because it doesn't banish XYZ materials. but put it when you are done setting up.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Cosmic Cyclone</strong> - A lot of meta decks have Spell and Traps with GY effects so it is better to get them banished.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>3x Dark Ruler No More</strong> - Best go 2nd card after <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, especially if you know they are running annoy stuff like <strong>Dragoon</strong>.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>1x Red Reboot</strong> - If you go 2nd or you know your opponent runs a lot of annoying traps, this card takes care of them. Especially for the face, you can activate it from the hand.</div> <div></div> <div><strong>Strategy:</strong></div> <div></div> <div>When playing this deck, you want to be playing more defensively and as possible. Time <strong>Thief Winder</strong> and <strong>Regulator</strong> are your best starting plays. And when you are stuff cards in <strong>Redoer</strong> or even <strong>Doublebarrel</strong>, you particularly want to stuff them up with spells and traps. That is where <strong>Time Thief Flyback</strong> comes in and <strong>Time Thief Startup</strong> comes up while in the grave. I generally made this deck where you can go 1st or 2nd, it won't matter much. So that is why I run stuff like <strong>Evenly Matched</strong> as a main deck card. Ideally, when going 1st you want to get out <strong>Time Thief Redoer</strong> and then get out <strong>Perpetua</strong>. When going 2nd, I would recommend getting out <strong>Doublebarrel </strong>or a different XYZ/Link depending on the situation.</div> <div></div> <div>Either way, I had a lot of fun playing this deck and I hope you guys get to try it out!</div>"

You can use any type of black luster soldier so you can instantly ritual summon another or the same black luster soldier.  I am aware that link summoning soldier of chaos is hard because of Impcantation's effect of not allowing you to summon from the extra deck. It's not impossible though.

With it being able to attack all special summoned monsters and it's 4K attack it can get over most monsters. And being able to get rid of max 2 monsters on the field from a quick effect and not being effected by monster effects is a bonus.</li>  	<li>Quadrantids- The red headed stepchild of the group. Although not being able to pop cards as a quick effect, this card instead destroys all spell and trap cards. Although this effect is only a guarantee if you use two monsters with level equal to 2. Still it being unaffected by spells and traps and still having 4K attack is a plus. It's a good spell and trap counter if the opponent has a lot of spells.</li>  	<li>Demise- Good for whipping boards and protecting monsters. With the only monster that will really stay on your field for the whole turn being ritual monsters, Demise's effect of protecting Ritual monsters from being destroyed by battle is great protection and a good support to have on the field</li>  	<li>Amorphactor Pain- A good effect negator for extra deck monsters. This card negates the effect of fusions, synchros, and xyz monsters. A bonus effect the card has is the turn the monster is summoned, your opponents next main phase 1 is skipped. Although it could be beat out by a link monster with a high enough attack</li> </ul> Best set ups with ritual monsters: <ul>  	<li>Draconids and Quadrantids- Having the two boss monsters of the archetype on the field is always a good sign. With them both having 4K attack along with being immune to monster effects and spells and traps, it is a great board set up.</li>  	<li>Demise and Draconids- Demise can destroy all cards on the field at the cost of 2K life points. Draconids is unaffected by monster effects so if you could get this set up going second you could leave your opponent with 1K life points left.</li>  	<li>Amorphactor Pain and Draconids- With Amorphactor negating the effects of extra deck monsters and Draconids being able to attack all special summoned monsters, it helps Draconids get over any effects that could change their attack or negates destruction by battle.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

Or OTK if you go second. The deck's weakness is that it is very weak to negations, hand traps like Infinite Impermanence, Nibiru the Primal Being and Ash Blossom. Especially now that Called by the Grave and Red Reboot are limited. Which of course in this day and age isn't an exactly good quality in a deck. However the deck is still fun to play eventhough the games usually end up in you dying to hand trap or opponent surrendering/quiting.  Replays: https://youtu.be/kPpkGYS3VVk"

Ready for 2021..,"Thoughts to consider below from a long time red eyes player...  Spam gearfried and black metal dragon combo.  Use one for one to help bring out a lvl 1.  Black Stone for summoning or Effect Veiler / rider of the storm winds for synchro.  Also World Legacy Guardagon for revival of a lvl 1 into a synchro or into Relinquished Anima / Linkuriboh if you're in trouble.  Use The King of D to play your Dragon Revival Rhapsody.  You also have the option to go for effect veiler with One for One, if you need a spellcaster for your Dragon Revival Rhapsody whenever The King of D isn't present.  Return of the Dragon Lords is your main protection from the GY.  Rider of the Storm Winds provides some.  Number 11 Big Eye will also get you out of trouble.  Successor soul too. This will help you dispose of an enemy monster.  When activating Dragon shrine, send Keeper of the Shrine as your second monster to the GY. You want him there as quickly as possible for safety and further plays. Noctovision is also your friend, especially to gain a second monster for your xyz.  Spam burn damage and fusion ASAP. Predaplant will be your friend here too if needed.  You dont need 3 Fusion or 3 Insight.  3 Red eyes will also brick too often so I stick with 2. I prefer 2 flare rather than 1 as you can often use his burn damage.  You also need to be wary of lack of draw power hence why I have 2 allure.  Still toying with Cards of the Red Stone and Reasoning.  &nbsp;"

The goal is to turbo out master peace (the one that's not banned), or to just spam cards as much as you can with only using three effect monsters.  for reference the cards I used points on were: an extra copy of box, a copy of diagram, and an extra copy of goldriver  Any and all feedback would be very helpful seeing as this is my first attempt at a trinity deck.  edit: didn't realize terraforming was co forbidden, replaced it with metaverse."

The deck is still missing some things and i'm running not that many copies of some staples here, and i'm using banned cards mostly because i'm playing against AI right now, i don't think it'd take many edits to get it legal in any case if i wanted to.  &nbsp;  The maindeck:  monsters:  2-3 copies of the staples as deckspace allowed, plus x2 copies of Lady Debug. If i was to remove a Gazelle to adhere to Limited legality i'd throw in a 3rd copy of one of the monsters at 2, probably Falco or Spinny. I don't run any monsters in the maindeck over level 4, so i have to rely on Link Summons, and my Fusions to do most of the heavy lifting in terms of ATK, Jack Jaguar is the best at 1800. The monsters are mostly just trying to be value-machines to get the actual threats out of the extra deck efficiently.  spells: I run a lot of illegal stuff currently to beat the ai and to account for what i have in my collection in LOTD. Pot of Greed is simply the best card draw available to use against the AI so i'm taking advantage of the ai not caring about me using banlisted cards. i'm also using a full playset of circles for more consistancy v.s. the ai. if i were playing against actual people i'd probably use a 1-of of pot of desires and an extra MST, and, since Circe is at-1 i'd probably replace those 2 cards by beefing up the traps a bit by adding another CotH, and throwing in a Infinite Impermanence.  &nbsp;  Traps: 1 mirror force to use in tandem with the raigeki for removal in case i have a hard time sacking a link monster for the removal effect on Salamangreat Rage. Since i currently use two Talkers in my extra deck, i felt a 1-of of Recoded Alive was justifiable. I'd probably cut it the second i got something better than the Talkers (cough savage borrelsword dragon cough another heatleo or so cough)  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  Currently only have 1 heatleo (i really need at least 1 more....) running the Decode Talker and Encode Talker to mostly beef up my amount of Link-3s. Firewall Dragon and the xyz are placeholders to get through LOTD stuff since they're banned, would ideally replace them with a second heatleo and maybe Accesscode Talker to get more out of Recoded Alive or Savage Borrelsword Dragon if i could fit tuners in here. (so if i was to play this deck against people the banned cards would instead be like another heatleo and either of the above options, if I went for Savage Borrelsword over Accesscode I would try to make maindeck room for Ash Blossoms, obviously.)  I have no idea what i would put in a sidedeck currently, i'm casual/new."

They may not be all that scary on their own, but the more Talkers you get out the worse it becomes for your opponent! With monsters that special or link from hand, summoning multiple link 3's is an absolute breeze. The two most important cards in this deck, hands down are Microcoder and Cynet Codec. Micro Coder allows you to search any cynet spell or trap when linked from hand and codec allows you to search for a cyberse monster of the same attribute as the code talker you just summoned. These two cards allow you to start picking up momentum towards and end board. Below I'll put one of the most basic combos that ends on an un-targetable Accesscode Talker  To start this combo you need to have two cards in your hand. Balancer Lord and Lady Debug <ol>  	<li>Summon Balancer Lord and activate its effect to get another normal summon</li>  	<li>Summon Lady Debug, activate its effect to bring Microcoder to hand</li>  	<li>Link summon Lady Debug and Micro Coder from your hand to link summon Code Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Micro Coder's effect in grave to bring Cynet Codec to hand</li>  	<li>Activate Cynet Codec</li>  	<li>Link summon Transcode Talker with Balancer Lord and Code Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Cynet Codec and bring Code Generator to hand</li>  	<li>Activate Transcode's effect to special summon Code Talker from grave to the zone he points to</li>  	<li>Link Code Generator from hand with Code Talker to summon Encode Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Cynet codec, search Lady Debug</li>  	<li>Activate Code Generator in grave to send Dotscaper to grave</li>  	<li>Activate Dotscaper's ability and special summon it from the grave</li>  	<li>Link Dotscaper and Encode to summon Accesscode Talker</li>  	<li>Activate Accesscode talker and target Encode, boosting its attack points by 3000</li> </ol> You can choose to stop on Encode to have two un-targetable monsters with Encode protecting Transcode and Transcode able to bring Encode back if it's destroyed. Other than that there are many more ways to go about this deck. All of the ""Code"" main deck monsters have abilities when linked from the field so you can make some spicy mix-ups with that. Other cards you really don't wanna sleep on are Prohibit Snake, a hand trap that bounces, Cynet Storm, a field spell that boosts your monsters and makes link summons unable to be negated, and Cynet Conflict, a searchable counter trap that negates effects if you have a Code Talker on the field as well as banishing the card and preventing your opponent from activating cards of the same name until the end of the next turn!  This is by no means the best version of this deck, but I hope you have as much fun as I did!"

I think its very good in terms of accomplishing its goal; to get Bahamut out and summon Toadally. I've played with this deck casually quite a bit and I very rarely brick. If I do brick I usually have some kind of draw power in hand, either Upstart or  Moray, but almost every monster card in this deck allows me to get some kind of combo going.  I'm looking for all kinds of suggestions with this deck to improve it, I love sharks and when I found out there was a shark deck I went all in.

Swordstalker can be a good target for Silent Doom and save the Ancient Rules to get the Blue-Eyes White Dragon out onto the field. First Of The Dragons and Alligator's Sword Dragon are also relatively easy to get out, with traps such as Quaking Mirror Force keeping the materials safe and Birthright reviving them even if they are destroyed. Heat Wave can also shut down your opponents summons for a turn most likely, whilst keeping yours available. Exiled Force and Effect Veiler are included for coverage and cards such as Inspiration and Shrink can help in destroying tougher opponents."

Lava Golem is also a tactic here, summon him and then immobilize him with Spellbinding Circle. If they break that trap, use creature swap to take him back and either tribute him or attack with him for a big finishing blow."

Dark World Plunder Patroll Golden Castle of Stromberg. Basically, this is a greedy midrange discard.dek that can do a little bit of everything depending on your hand, it has lots of niche interactions that let you more or less pop off. This deck doesn't care about the contents of your hand, deck or anything else, and can simply ram it's resources in to the opponent until it loses  Some interactions of note: Mirage of Nightmare is the best and worst card in the deck, you can use it to trigger discard effects, but really the deck wants it to draw in to handtraps and Plunder ammunition, The issue is that you can get stuck in a discard loop where you have no hand on your turn. I've included a high density of cards that allow you to remove your own mirage and keep the cards it draws, including all the quick-play backrow removal, Set Rotation, Forbidden Droplets, and even Hop Ear Squadron to go in to Vulcan the Divine. You can also do all these same things to keep Golden Castle of Stromberg from milling your deck, if you have a line in mind that you need to search for  Danger! Zone: usually, you want to use this when you have a Danger in your hand already. it is almost always a +1 or 2. It's actually totally valid to run 3 of this card, but points are fairly tight here and the third Whitebeard is usually better. If you don't have a Danger in hand, you can empty out your hand to fish for a hit with it, if you miss, you didn't really lose anything because it was dead regardless  Plunder Patroll: This archetype has to many wacky interactions for me to tell you, you really just have to play the deck long enough to learn them, but my main tips are: watch out for Xeno-Locks on Whitebeard and Goldenhair; All Plunder Patroll discards are costs so they don't trigger Dark Worlds, but this can be mitigated with Mothman and Ojama Pink; Getting 2 Shipyarrd in rotation enables the top end of what the archetype can do."

Now keep in mind if you put wight baking (new card) in the grave from your deck you either get a +1 or stay neutral with card advantage.</span>  <span>When <strong>Wight baking</strong> is sent to the GY, you draw any 2 cards with ""skull servant"" in their text and discard 1 card from your hand which will always be <strong>Wightprince</strong>. With <strong>Wight baking</strong>'s effect any Wight cards count as skull servants, so you can pull them out of your deck. He is also really good hand trap protection when you have a <strong>King of skull servant</strong> on the field</span>  <span>When using <strong>Wightprince's</strong> effect to summon <strong>King of skull servants</strong> servant you almost always want to banish 2 <strong>The Lady in Wight</strong> or 1 <strong>The Lady in Wight</strong> and 1 <strong>Wightprincess</strong></span>  <span><strong>The Lady in Wight </strong>completely negates the effect of spell and trap for all level 3 or lower zombie type monsters except for herself. This adds an additional layer to keep <strong>King of Skull servants</strong> safe</span>  <span><strong>Wightmare</strong> can special summon a <strong>King of skull servant</strong> or <strong>The Lady in Wight t</strong>o the field, he can also bring a <strong>Skull servant</strong> or <strong>Wightmare </strong>to the GY. You almost always want to special summon either <strong>King of skull servant</strong> or<strong> The Lady in Wight</strong> to the field with this card's effect</span>  <span><strong>Wightprincess</strong> act as a handtrap and when summoned can send <strong>Wightprince</strong> to the grave, keep in mind her handtrap effect can also be used on the field and when her effect gets used she boosts ""King of skull servants"" damage by 1000.</span>  <span>The main 3 benefits from the shiranui support is the 2 trap cards and syncro summoning from the grave. </span>  <span><strong>Shiranui style shallow slash</strong> can be used to get rid of backrow or to shut down your opponent's combo in their first turn when they normal summon.</span>  <span><strong>Shiranui style samsara</strong> stops you from getting OTK'd by banishing 1 monster preferably with 0DEF and also let's you draw +1 card by recycling 2 0DEF banished monsters. For example syncro summoning from the grave with shiranui, or recycling wightprince and wightprincess into your deck.</span>  <span><strong>Powerful rebirth</strong> is useful to bring back the <strong>King of skull servants</strong> or <strong>Wightprincess</strong> which will send another <strong>Wightprince</strong> to the grave and her handtrap effect can be used again or bring back a <strong>Gozuki</strong> to send more cards to the grave.</span>  <span><strong>King of skull servants</strong> does have 1 weakness, destroyed by card effects. However his attack can theoretically reach 18k and he can come back to the field when destroyed by battle if there is a skull servant to banish in the GY. Having 1 star also let's him benefit from <strong>Wightprincess</strong>'s effect.</span>  <span><strong>Archfiend Zombie skull</strong> does help to remove <strong>King of skull servants</strong> weakness</span>  <span><strong>Mezuki</strong> is used to counter <strong>King of skull servants</strong> weakness</span>  <span><strong>Gozuki </strong>can be used to send <strong>Wightprince</strong>, <strong>Wight baking</strong> or the occasional <strong>Mezuki</strong> to the graveyard. Can also be used to special summon <strong>King of skull servants</strong> or <strong>Wightpricess</strong> from your hand when destroyed. </span>  <span><strong>Samurai skull </strong>Similar to Gozuki's effect, but he can only send 1 monster upon summon to the GY which is why Gokuki's effect is better there. However the cost to summon a monster from the deck is nothing and is beter than Gozuki's effect.</span>  <span><strong>Needlebug nest</strong> is used to get monsters in the grave as quick as possible also give <strong>King of skull servants</strong> an ATK boost</span>  <span><strong>Performerpal Pop-up</strong> is an interesting card, you can ignore most of it's effect except the first 2 parts and the cost. Send up to 3 cards from your hand to the GY, draw that many cards, pay 1000LP for each card in your hand. LP doesn't matter all too much for an effect this great. If <strong>Weightprince</strong>, <strong>Mezuki</strong> and <strong>Wight baking</strong> was sent to the GY you end up with 7 ""skull servant"" cards in the GY, a mezuki and you draw +1 more from <strong>Wight baking</strong> and +3 more cards from <strong>Pop-up</strong> to start your combo. All that potentially from just 1 card.</span>  <strong><span>Allure of darkness </span></strong><span>is a good staple card it let's you draw 2 cards, but be aware of what monsters are in your hand, otherwise you risk banishing monsters you don't want to.</span>  <strong><span>Update 1.1</span></strong> <table>  <tr> <td><span><strong><span>Action</span></strong></span></td> <td><span><strong><span>Card</span></strong></span></td> <td><span><strong><span>Reason</span></strong></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Removed</span></td> <td><span>Summoned skull</span></td> <td><span>meme card</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Reduced to 1</span></td> <td><span>Performapal pop-up</span></td> <td><span>Becomes harder to play after taking damage once</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Increased to 3</span></td> <td><span>Samurai Skull</span></td> <td><span>Performance was a lot better than expected, makes up for missing draw power by sending <strong>Wight Baking</strong> directly from deck to GY.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Removed </span></td> <td><span>Archfiend's Call </span></td> <td><span>Was meant to be support to bring out <strong>Summoned skull</strong> (meme card) more often. </span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Added to 2</span></td> <td><span>Forbidden Droplet</span></td> <td><span>Extremely useful tech card to remove or avoid nasty effects on the field, while still sending monsters from your hand to the grave.

If your opponent targets <strong>Shiranui style samsara</strong> you can always still use it's effect, because its effect doesn't stop even if it leaves the field. </span>  <span>You | Turn 5</span>  <span>Draw, you get a <strong>Needlebug nest</strong>. Depending on your previous <strong>Needlebug nest</strong>, if you got lucky and got a <strong>Mezuki</strong> in the grave you can always bring <strong>King of skull servants</strong> back to the field.

Everybody goes on about how Madolche is a going second deck, but let's be honest, in the current format going second is almost always met with 2+ negates. One if you're lucky. PSY- Frame would probably run better with the engine style, keeping monsters out of the GY but I own Ash IRL and still think it's a staple. Solemn Judgement to be safe, is there anything that gets past it? Probably, but chances are you won't have any issues. Paying half your LP doesn't really do anything, again, current format, duels don't last too many turns. Negate as much as you can to set up the EASY OTK combo. I won't be posting any actual combo instructions, these can be found everywhere.  The dimension shifter is experimental, but hear me out:  Perfect going first board/hand-  Teacher (GY disruption)  Promenade and maybe a chalice (1/2x negate)  Ash in hand (pushing it but I have gotten this hand quiet a few times)  Indestructible Hoot from Jelly, straight chillin  Sistart (protect the backline)  And bangggg Shifter to end.  How many deck engines rely on GY? MOST  This sets you up for an easy win.  Going second is far more tricky IMO. Madolche doesn't deal with negates too well.  You can always swap out/add as you please. The best thing about this deck is the freedom of choice.  Keep that Side Deck handy cause there are so many swaps that can be made depending on your situation."

Atrribute whirlwind,"Charmers are well... underpowered. I know this is not a shock to anyone, but the old beatdown style with different attributes and splashable ATK or DEF spellcaster values make this an interesting mash up. The new Charmer spell from the SD ""Spirit Charmers"" really gives the consistency to run the other archetype cards like Awakening and Possessed Partnerships. Awakening is a card the more competitive builds I have seen shy away from or only use at 1 copy, but being able to just amass different attributes to beat down over most monsters and getting an extra draw most turns is actually pretty useful, since the other engines do the control and focus on the extra deck utility. An obvious consistency booster would be Nadir's Servant, but I do not own any copies of that or Fleurdalies yet. I wanted to run 1 of each attribute charmer to make Awakening as useful as possible and stick to Charmers being the central focus. Dogmatika is an obvious pairing since having spellcasters that have 1500 DEF to revive off of the Charmer cards while being sticky and getting a lot of searches in is huge. Invoked is a 1 card engine that can utilize the varying attributes so I felt it had to be combined with the Charmers as well and is just standalone good.  I have not experimented with Shaddoll or Magistus cards in here, but I feel this combination is about the most competitive that can be made without having access to the $70+ cards (and only 1 invocation). Last thing that people could consider is the Dragoon package since you get a good amount of extra draws and searches it will always have discard fodders and is inline with the control and pop theme of the deck, but that would make 2-3ish dead cards if drawn and this deck is all about having a use for everything you draw (so no handtraps). Half the deck is dedicated towards Charmers to be super consistent and a fun rogue deck that can be built up with more $ and transform into the linear InvokedShaddollDogmatika if you want to get into regionals and be the most competitive. Not many techs in here as I run large amounts of each package/archetype and like how it plays with keeping it cheap (The 3x Ecclesia and 1x Invocation are about $100 and most of the deck cost).  &nbsp;  Main deck Charmer package:  1x of each Charmer - they are vanilla essentially but synchronize with all the archetype spell or traps and provide more Invoked access. The Lyna is the clear cut since there is already so many lights in the deck and Fairy Tail Luna is clearly better to normal, just can't be used with Charmers S/T outside of the draw from Awakening. I just wanted to run a copy of each personally  3x Spirit Charmers - a 2 for 2 that lets you set up anything you want from the Charmer package and provides huge consistency  3x Awakening of the Possessed - boosts your whole field with each attribute and gets an extra draw a lot of the time. Also adds card destruction protection for the Charmer monsters that people usually overlook  3x Possessed Partnerships - reborn a Dogmatika or Charmer then pop 1 if you have 2+ attributes and can be used to put Awakening or Unpossessed back on the field  1x Unpossessed - a free SS for a different attribute 1500 DEF mon when ANY monster is destroyed by ANY means. Also gives a +800 ATK to your Charmer attacks and battle destruction protection to them. Only 1 needed since it can be recycled and searched from Spirit  2x Fairy Tail - Luna - a pseudo light Charmer that can search on summon and is a main consistency card, 3 is optimal but I wanted to run a Lyna instead. Useful for bouncing an opponents monster face up unless they send another one to the GY  2x Witchcrafter Golem Aruru -  a good budget card as it came in the structure deck and provides a quick effect bounce on an opponents card if a spellcaster is targeted or attacked. Useful tech that could be run at 3 or cut in favor of something else. Also just a big body that can come out pretty easy  &nbsp;  Main deck Dogmatika package:  3x Ecclesia - just a super good card that pairs well with the Possessed Partnerships, Invoked, and slow down your opponent  1x Ashiyan - the 2nd best 1500 DEF from the archetype that can give a boost and recycle a card on top of being a free body from a Titaniklad send  3x Punishment - a great disruption that can generate advantage or more pops and is searchable  &nbsp;  Main Deck Invoked package:  3x Aleister - duh he runs the whole archetype and is a 1 card fusion that can be used every turn and searched from the field spell and by extent Terraforming or Metaverse  1x Invocation - the neccessary spell for the archetype, I only have 1 of but am fine with these numbers as it doesnt lead to boring fusion and pray for the best hands  3x Meltdown - search and guarantee the fusion summons  &nbsp;  Main deck techs:  1x Terraforming - Get the invoked cards live or slap down the secret village  1x Metaverse - refer to that ^  1x Secret Village of the Spellcasters - likely lock your opponent out of blowout techs and draw power without fear of it blocking you since you will almost always have a spellcaster in hand even if your monsters get nuked  1x Callled By the Grave - stop any annoying shennanigans  2x Crackdown - use opponent monsters for link material 0r just hold them to prevent climbing and effects. 3 would not hurt anything if a charmer mon or golem was removed  &nbsp;  Extra deck:  1x of each Charmer link -  link off opponent monsters or steal them from their GY  1x Abyss Dweller - prevent GY extenders and use almost any monster card in the deck to make  1x Selene Master of Magicians - Link climb to bring back a choice mon  1x Borrelsword Dragon - Big boi get bigger, condenses your field if need be too, can be sent to out Zeus  2x Titaniklad -  send for Dogmatika stuff and search. A third copy is almost never needed and I only have 2 so it works out well  1x N'tss - send for an extra pop, only have 1 but 2 or 3 could be useful depending on the matchup if you are willing to cut something else from the ED  2x Mechaba - great control card and easy to make in this deck, if 3 is needed your game is probably so long and grindy you are in a bad spot as is  1x Caliga - 1 attack and 1 monster effect can lock many decks down. very underrated but only accessable by a sent ED card or the Dharc (not relying on your opponents monsters)  1x Purg - keep swinging and piercing, could be cut but I like the option for a fusion that can attack all monsters  1x Raidjin - flip whatever nonesense your opponent has down and can be brought out with instant fusion. 1 is plenty since you don't always need it but is a great utility to have  &nbsp;  Side:  1x Pankratops - obvious good go second card, can help comeback if you get nuked as well  1x Feather Duster - ^  1x Raigeki - ^  1x Monster Reborn - sometimes better than the possessed trap because it can bring back your ED mons, but wont get extra pops or draws usually. Is a spell instead of a trap too  1x Set Rotation - matchup specific, but can annoy the hell out of opponents by blocking starters or make them pop it  3x DRNM - imo the best going second card right now and always is good to allow you to set up a board  3x Night Beam - after experimenting with each removal, this is the best for going second I have found. Does nothing for going first and probably wont be too useful turn 3, but they cannot chain the target unlike cosmic or MST and it has no card cost like twin twisters.  1x Pot of Avarice - Recycle and draw for a grindy match  3x Summon Limit - keep the wombo combos under control if you go first  &nbsp;  Thanks for the read on my first decklist post and give me your thoughts and feedback below! Keep in mind I am a newer player who does not have all the fancy expensive cards yet and my locals has a ton of variety so I did not make it specifically to be anti-meta or degenerate lock. I want to know if anyone has seen others have success with the Charmer cards as well and if you guys like keeping in the Lyna + Dharc and Golem and any other spice to consider. The side deck is the part most open to change in my opinion. Lastly, this does do well on DB also and some people just quit after seeing spirit into awakening + a charmer then using punishment on their turn so that's fun."

Prank kids recently took 1st In the Remote duel Invitat,"<span>Prank-kids were always a solid tier 2 option for the metagame. This was because it was a little too reliant on the normal summon and it lost to ash blossom. What was worse was that it could just not play against well established boards. Prank Kids are no longer tier 2 and I believe they are now a tier 1 contender in the metagame. Prank kids recently took 1st In the Remote duel Invitational and were undefeated (8-0)!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Before we get into the deck explanation, just a quick reminder that I explain all of this, show all the combos and talk about playing through nibiru ALL in my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and also notifies you every time I upload!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the Video -<a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBrDJIQRxg8</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is inspired off of the 1st place build. I think the reason for Prank Kids to not shine earlier was because people were not sure how to correctly play/use the deck. This happens to all new decks and experimentation is the key to finding the best possible way to utilize the deck. Pranks kids is just another example. Prank kids have evolved and there are some changes to how the deck is played. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Problems and how they are addressed -</b> <ol>  	<li> <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Losing to HandTraps </b><span>- The “new and improved” Prank Kids plays an additional number of extenders so that it doesn't lose to handtraps, especially ash blossom.  Prank Kids from before used Poly, Prank-Kids Pandemonium, Instant Fusion and in some cases even called by the grave. The new kind of build uses all of those cards and also uses Parallel Exceed. Parallel exceed is a great card to chain block the ash and it can also be used to make an extra abyss dweller which is a game changer in some cases because graveyard decks are EVERYWHERE in this metagame. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Extra deck Ratios</b><span> - Another difference from the old version is that now prank kids is not a combo focused deck, but a control deck. The new version does not play Prank-kids Plan or the Prank-kids Rip-Roarin-Roaster and only plays 1 copy of Prank-kids Battle butler and Prank-kids Bow-wow-bark. Battle butler is the deck’s main negation and Playing only 1 copy may seem absurd but it can easily be recycled off of Prank-kids Pranks, a card that can easily be searched off of Prank-kids Doodle-doodle-doo. The only Prank kids card we are running 3 of (in the extra deck) is Prank-kids Meow-meow-mu and this is because it is the deck’s main link monster (a link 1) and can also not be recycled since it has a graveyard that banishes itself from the GY. The deck also plays some more generic removal cards in the extra deck including the Knightmares - Phoenix and Unicorn and Accesscode talker as well. Accesscode is also a great OTK card. The extra deck also runs verte to speed up the engine. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Playing through well established boards</b><span> - The deck also addresses the problem of fighting a well established board very well. In this build of mine I am playing 3 forbidden droplet, 2 Cosmic Cyclone, 3 Mystic mine, 1 terraforming (to search mine and can also search Prank-kids Place) and the 1 Set Rotation (can search mine or place). I hate to say this but Mystic Mine is actually a very good addition to Prank kids. It was also used in the 1st place deck. It is a lifesaver if you get hit with something like a nibiru and can save duels. It is a win condition on its own. Forbidden Droplet is another way to clear boards and it can also counter True King of All Calamities, the most dangerous card in the metagame in my opinion. It is essential to play droplet in this because gamma cannot be played in prank-kids and also because VFD = free win for the opponent if you don’t have the right countermeasures. Cosmic Cyclone is great to deal with backrow, counters Virtual World and is a great removal option.</span></li> </ol> </li> </ol> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Comboing <span>- The deck can combo fairly easily and every single kid is a starter. Place, terraforming and set rotation are also starters since they all eventually search a kid. The deck (counting the searchers as well) has 17 starters! The combo only needs any kid to perform! The nibiru proof version of the combo can also be done if you draw the right hand (combos in my video). The deck can also do the nibiru proof combos very easily and consistently. I have 2 Nibiru proof combos in my video for you to check out.</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1"">Handtraps and control <span>- The deck is playing Droll and Lock Bird and ash blossom as the handtrap choices. This deck cannot run gamma because it will brick and doesn't really work in Prank-kids unfortunately. Droll is an amazing counter to most decks mainly Drytron which is literally everywhere. Ash is just a staple and can counter anything. For the control part of the deck, we have the Mystic mines, droplet, the knightmares, and some others. After you control the board, you can easily just OTK the opponent with accesscode.

The Tri-brigade cards just generate SOOO much advantage - It is literally like link summoning by banishing the materials from the graveyard!! The Lyrilusc part of the deck can get the combos going and can also search and special summon Nervall - a very important combo piece. Lyrilusc (Using Tri-brigade) recently took 2nd in the 2021 Remote Duel Invitational as well! </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Before we get into the deck explanation, just a quick reminder that I explain all of this, show all the combos and talk about playing through nibiru and getting rid of bricks ALL in my Youtube video. Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and also notifies you every time I upload!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the Video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqPOhP9N3Ks</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>The deck is really powerful - being able to make infinite negate boards (using [YGOCard]Mist Valley Apex Avian[/YGOCard]) and also has access to a powerful floodgate ([YGOCard]Barrier Statue of the Storm Winds[/YGOCard]), removal cards like [YGOCard]Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder[/YGOCard], [YGOCard]Alpha, the Master of Beasts[/YGOCard], [YGOCard]Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen[/YGOCard], [YGOCard]Ancient Warriors Oath - Double Dragon Lords[/YGOCard] and some others. The deck can also consistently play through Nibiru! On top of all of that, the deck also plays multiple handtraps/removal cards like D.d Crow (Counters basically any deck that utilizes the GY and is also a winged beast), Droll and Lock Bird (counters Drytron!), Alpha (as I mentioned earlier) and Forbidden Droplet (counters VFD). The deck is also BRICKLESS! You may think I am lying right now because drawing cards like [YGOCard]Mist Valley Thunderbird[/YGOCard], [YGOCard]Mist Valley Apex Avian[/YGOCard], and the barrier statue are bricks. This is true but [YGOCard]Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom[/YGOCard] lets you draw a card and place a card in your hand to the bottom of the deck when she leaves the field and you make her in every single combo/scenario and she always leaves the field (not sure why you would keep her in the field but there are always exceptions). So if you draw an unwanted brick, Just put it in the bottom of the deck!! The deck can also combo fairly easily and can end on (easily) an infinite negate board and can also have more interruptions on top of that in the form of apollusa and Ancient Warriors Oath - Double Dragon Lords just in case the opponent has something like dark ruler or a kaiju to out Avain. The deck also has tons of removal (I listed earlier) and can OTK the opponent fairly easily. The deck can easily break boards and clear the way for big beaters to destroy the opponent (Mainly Accesscode and Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen). Overall, I think TrI-brigade is a solid metagame contender and can take on the top tier decks as well! </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Again, I explain all of this, show all the combos and talk about playing through nibiru and getting rid of bricks ALL in my Youtube video.
