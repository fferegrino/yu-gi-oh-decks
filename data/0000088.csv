Having Toon Kingdom makes it easier to keep the Toon Cyber Dragons on the field and cards like Toon Table of Contents and Toon Mask help get them on the field faster. Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon is another good target in this deck and has a few different ways of coming to the field through the Red-Eyes Toon Dragons and Toon Dark Magician. Toon Masked Sorcerer is great because he is protected by Toon Kingdom's effect and helps you +1 in card advantage. Toon Dark Magician Girl is valuable because this is the only toon card right now that can attack on the turn its summoned giving a little boost in speed to the way this deck can be played which is very important because Toon Chaos which claims to speed the Toon archetype up has not released yet. With Fang of Critias I have paired Mirror Force, Crush Card Virus and Ring of Destruction. I love running these in my deck because they have great effects and are easy to bring out. At the worst case scenario I just end up using the trap card by themselves since they are still strong staple cards. Abyss Dweller is in the extra deck as well for disruption and is easily brought to the field using the level 4 monsters that are about half of the monsters in the deck. Downerd Magician is also here in the case that I need to get a bigger monster on the field then  what I have access to at that time. This deck is a work in progress and will end up changing when toon Chaos comes out most likely. I also put comic hand in the side deck purely because I don't know what to get rid of but i know its an important card in a toon deck  PLEASE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR CRITIQUES ARE WELCOME!!!"

(TCG banlist),"This is a combo deck designed to go second and FTK from Crystron Halqifibrax while also clearing the opponent's field or setting up for negates. The combo requires at least one card on the opponent's field that can be targeted, or a clear field, and one card in the hand (which will be discarded and replaced). The combo goes as followed:  -Summon Halqifibrax, get O-Lion  -Summon Auroradon using Halqifibrax and O-Lion, use Auroradon and O-Lion's effects to get 4 tokens (if you have a Mecha Phantom Beast in your hand at this time, do not use O-Lion's effect).  -Summon Megaraptor from the deck by tributing 2 tokens  -Add Coltwing to your hand by tributing a token, then banish O-Lion to Normal Summon it  -Summon Ebon Illusion Magician using Coltwing and Megaraptor, then use its effect to detach Coltwing and get Magicalibra  -Summon Yazi using Magicalibra and the other token, then use Yazi's effect to destroy itself and an opponent's card, and summon Mare Mare from the deck  -Use Mare Mare's effect to bring out 3 tokens, and summon Accel Synchron using Mare Mare and a token  -Send Junk Synchron from the deck to the GY to increase Accel Synchron's level, then summon Baxia with Accel Synchron and the other tokens  -Send Baxia (if you do not plan to summon Satellite Warrior or Dingirsu) or Ebon Illusion Magician (if you do) to the GY with Baxia's effect to bring back Coltwing and get 2 tokens  -Discard a card to summon Jet Synchron from the GY, then summon Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 Burei using Jet Synchron and the tokens  -Summon Karakuri Komachi mdl 224 Ninishi with Burei's effect. If you have Ninishi in your hand (for combos that will end in Satellite Warrior) or Karakuri Gama mdl 4624 Shirokunishi (for combos that will end in Borreload Savage Dragon) in your hand, use Ninishi's effect to normal summon it.  -Summon another Burei using Ninishi and Coltwing  -Summon Shirokunishi with Burei's effect  -Summon Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X Bureido in defense position using Burei and Shirokunishi  -Use Bureido's effect to get Ninishi (if you want to get Satellite Warrior) or Shirokunishi (if you want to get Borreload Savage Dragon)  -Banish Shirokunishi to change Bureido's battle position and draw a card.  -Synchro summon using the Karakuri tuner you summoned and Burei. Get Borreload Savage Dragon if you summoned Shirokunishi, or Satellite Warrior if you summoned Ninishi. If you summon Borreload Savage Dragon, equip Halqifibrax to it from the GY.  -(Optional): Summon Dingirsu using Bureido and Baxia to send an opponent's card to the GY.  -Attack directly with the monsters you have Summoned. You should be able to do at least 8450 damage.  Two of each card that need to be summoned from the deck (not the hand) are included so drawing one does not ruin the combo.  Most main deck cards that are not part of the combo aim to prevent cards like Ash Blossom from shutting down the combo. Extra copies of Dragged Down and Exchange should be side decked in for most games, as many decks would side in Nibiru at this point."

Most importantly: no ritual package because it is trash (more on this later).  Some comments on my deck build: <ul>  	<li>Limitations. This is a going 2nd deck. 3x Lightning Storm and 3x Evenly Matched are great choices. Lightning Storm is great because it can out weird floodgates if you really have to, and Evenly Matched is great to because even though it skips battle phase, your main combo has a pop 3 spells + pop 3 monsters so it is worth skipping out on the OTK. Budget alternatives would be 1x Raigeki, 2x Dark Hole and 3x Book of Eclipse (nice tech imo, non targeting non destructive!).</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial Goods for extra access to field spell (see 2nd effect field spell). Once you have the field spell active it is soo good. If they pop it, then you reset it with literally any opening monster. They banish it, you might be able to recover it with A.I.dle Reborn. What matters in the end of the day is more consistent acces to it.</li>  	<li> I think A.I. Love Fusion is heavily underrated. Not only is it a ---non-targeting non destructive non monster effect--- removal of a link monster (e.g. Apollouse/Avramax etc.), but also the Earth Golem @Ignister has a Borrelsword like effect beating over pretty much any monster (+ it floats!).</li>  	<li>Card Destruction is a tech which I do not see in other builds of this deck. I love it though! I mean, you can literally recover any monster OR in archetype spell from graveyard using Doyon @Ignister, + you are actually incentiviced to send the field spell, since you can reset it using its 2nd effect from grave.</li>  	<li>Called by Grave is a must. Sometimes you MUST need that access to fthe ield spell, which is facilitated by this card. Infinite impermanence does not do much against this deck. Nibiru is kryptonite though.</li>  	<li>Linkross is NICE. I mean, it makes the deck soo much more versatile. I will not go into the details of my combos but to give some examples, the tokens spammed from Linkross can be used for A.I. Love Fusion (Diplexer Chimera), Linkuriboh in grave or Hiyari @Ignister's effect.</li>  	<li>Firewall Dragon Darkfluid Darkfluid for if you have to go first. Pikari + Achichi is a Firewall Dragon with 3 counters in the main monster zone (try to figure this one out hah, hint: search Doshin from Achichi). Also, it is one of the few cards that outs hard boards like Avramax due to its effect being available in battle phase.</li> </ul> Finally some last comments: <ul>  	<li>No ritual package. Its just trash. Simply due to the fact that you have to run 2 HARD bricks (in that drawing 1 stops the whole combo), + Cyberse Witch is only live with a spell in grave.</li>  	<li>I have left open some extra deck spots in case you wish to optimize/build on the current build.</li>  	<li>Some side deck suggestions like There Can Be Only One are provided. Do with it as you wish.</li> </ul> Lastly, please leave a comment(s) on what you think of my build! I am constantly looking to improve, tips and criticism are more than welcomed!

I hope not.,"Well, you no longer need Links in order to summon more than one Extra Deck monster, so that means I'm able to update my god awful Goblin deck to be more consistent. Isolde and most of the equip spells (Still running Moon Mirror cuz I'm dedicated to PLOOOOOOOSING and it helps to out some big scaries) have been ditched, along with any other Links I might've been running (I'm so sorry, Brute Enforcer). The only Link we play now is Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, because this deck is going to play the long game either way, so I figure I may as well play something to reward me for my patience. We're also playing a lot more cards that help with going first, namely Raflasia and her Hole (I chose Bottomless) and Giant Hand, because through extensive testing I've determined this deck can't play through negates for beans. Go first, summon Raflasia/Giant Hand (Depends on whether you open a Hole or not), try to pivet into different Xyz or Synchros depending on what your opponent has as you go along, get some damage off with your PLOOOSERS when you can, and pray you aren't blown out of the water completely before you can summon Megaclops or just swing for game in general.  Also not playing Utopia Double because I'm not a COWARD."

","I play on Dueling Nexus, and I was in the editor, adding Knightmare Unicorn and Knightmare Phoenix to the extra deck of the deck I was working on, when something caught my eye while I was typing. In Dueling Nexus, there is a little icon on the card if the card is TCG or OCG exclusive, Rush Duel exclusive, etc.. I wasn't typing particularly fast, so I saw an OCG icon pop up. Now, whenever I post a Deck (save this one), I try to test it a LOT. As long as I win a certain number of games and don't constantly get bricks, I'll be good with it. I have Knightmare Unicorn and Phoenix in my Extra Deck in a LOT of my decks, especially unpublished ones, because they're good generic Link Monsters. Point is, I see the different cards with kni, then knig, then knigh, (and so on and so forth), VERY often. So, I go check the new card out, and this archetype is what I was greeted with. I'm not sure when these guys got added to Dueling Nexus, but I hope I'm not late to the party. Usually, I would try to perfect a Deck before publishing it, but this Deck is a little more complicated than most, and one of the cards might be bugged. Here's my inital version of the deck. I might post a more Meta version later, if I can make it work."

The primary focus is to use <a data-name=""melody of awakening dragon"">Melody of Awakening Dragon</a> too bring some blue eyes cards to your hand, and either use <a data-name=""fusion sage"">fusion sage</a> and/or <a data-name=""polymerization"">polymerization</a> to create the legendary <a data-name=""blue-eyes alternative ultimate dragon"">blue-eyes alternative ultimate dragon</a>, or use <a data-name=""delta flyer"">delta flyer</a> and some of the other tuners to summon one of the powerful synchro monsters! You can, of course, simply dominate with blue eyes, although it is a normal monster, and by today's standards it's kind of weak as a stand-alone monster. <a data-name=""Blue-eyes alternative white dragon"">Blue-eyes alternative white dragon</a>, is, however, slightly more powerful, with the ability to destroy cards. An easy way to get it to the field is to add it to your hand (if you don't already have it) with melody of awakening dragon, adding blue-eyes alternative, as well as a regular blue eyes to reveal, therefor, special summoning alternative dragon. <a data-name=""Nimble momonga"">Nimble momonga</a>, is a card that I don't see very often in blue-eyes decks, mostly because it's main purpose is for summoning monsters that need 2 or more tributes, and although blue-eyes does need 2 tributes to summon, there is clearly many more easier ways so special summon it, however, Nimble momonga is nice for LP gain, and if you have a blue-eyes in your hand, but no other way to summon it than plain old tributing. <a data-name=""Red-eyes darkness metal dragon"">Red-eyes darkness metal dragon</a> is a card that I didn't really use, until recently, and I realize now, that it is a kick-butt card! It is super easy to summon, and allows you to bring back your dragons from the graveyard, or summon one from your hand! Super awesome! Getting cards to the graveyard is usually pretty easy, but to make it simpler, I added <a data-name=""foolish burial"">foolish burial</a>, which allows you so send a monster straight from the deck to the grave! This card can either be used to send <a data-name=""white stone of ancients"">white stone of ancients</a> to the graveyard, to activate it's effect, or you can send any old monster to the graveyard, and special summon it with either red-eyes darkness metal's effect, or with <a data-name=""monster reborn"">monster reborn</a>, which can be brought back and used again with <a data-name=""ankuriboh"">ankuriboh</a>'s helpful ability. I am also now realizing as i'm writing this that it would have been simpler to just add dragon shrine, but i'm lazy, so i'm just gonna leave it as it is with foolish burial. Another card I decided to skip out on was silver's cry, I decided on <a data-name=""return of the dragon lords"">return of the dragon lords</a> instead, because that card works for more than just blue-eyes, and has multiple uses with it. You can add dragon shrine and/or silver's cry if you want. They would make great editions to this deck :) I have also added <a data-name=""trade in"">trade in</a>, which is an awesome card for this deck, because it allows you to draw, and discarding one of your monsters doesn't really matter, considering, as said before, we have ways to get them back. The final cards I should mention, are <a data-name=""chaos form"">chaos form</a> and b<a data-name=""lue-eyes chaos MAX dragon"">lue-eyes chaos MAX dragon</a>. I added these cards because MAX dragon is AWESOME! High attack, immunity to effects, and that double piercing damage is SWEET! It needs a high level monster or a blue eyes to summon it, but luckily, we have many of those! I hope you enjoy this deck. If you have the cards, make it! If you don't, you can make it on Dueling nexus, try it out! Edit it! I hope this wasn't too long, this is the first deck I made (the first good deck, I had an old account), so yeah... :)  &nbsp;  If you have any tips on what to add, feel free to add them in the comments, or make your own deck with those edits.

With the new Numerons releasing, they finally have an answer. This deck is split into 2 parts. The Numeron part is what I will call ""Plan A."" With multiple ways to search out Numeron Network, it should be your main goal. However, there are still ways you should go about baiting any Ash Blossoms your opponent might have. This is also where the Timelords, or ""Plan B"", come in. If done right, your opponent will assume you're playing just regular Timelords, and as such, try and hit those cards specifically. Time Maiden is the perfect Ash Blossom bait as searching any of your Timelords can be very strong. If it does bait an Ash, you're still free to search out your Numeron Network and switch to that mode. Going first, your best bets are ending on Zexal, Apollusa, or Megaclops. Going second, you can either try and otk with the Numerons, put down Megaclops if your opponent has no Xyzs, or summon one of the Borrel dragons. If all else fails and they shut down your Numeron strategy, you can still fall back on ""Plan B"" and just try finishing them off with Timelords.  [Notable Plays] -Time Maiden to bait Ash Blossoms. -Summoning Timelords to bait monster negation, then sending them to the grave with Advance Draw to clear the field for Numeron Calling. -Using Maiden as Twin-Twister fodder in order to be able to banish her for a Timelord. Summoning Metaion while you have Megaclops out is very powerful as it'll be immune to Metaion's bounce effect. -If in a mirror match, try to either Ash the Numeron Network, or Imperm the Zexal. If they do get Zexal out, remember you can still summon so just putting a Timelord on the field to stall can often be enough."

The main goal of this deck is to get cards like endymion +a spell counter card and mythical beast Jackal king to negate spells, traps, and monster affect when you need to. I will not be demonstrating a combo due to the fact you get negation power due to what your opponent does. I left the side deck open because it is always fluctuating due to the current meta decks, and people will likely use their personal preferences.  This deck takes time to learn and master and I do not believe that I have done that yet so comments and critique are very welcome."

And after 2 to 3 weeks of being stuck at home and slowly being converted into a JoJo fan, I thought to myself, ""I should make a deck profile based on JoJo Part 4!""  &nbsp;  So I did. After seeing Yoshikage Kira and his Stand, Killer Queen, I knew EXACTLY which deck I wanted to make: Lunalights! So here is my Lunalight deck, named after Killer Queen.

Main strategy is to cycle cards in hand to get perfection and others on the field. Best opening card is diviner, and pitching Arc to search whatever missing piece you have. If you have a combination of Idaten, Benten, or Machine Angel Ritual, summon Idaten by pitching Benten, then search dawn via idaten and perfection via benten. If you are leading into this from the diviner play, you can add absolute and vrash to get vrash on the field with 4000 atk. Also cycling idaten tributes, via ritual or merciful, will get you big walls/beat sticks with Perfection and Vrash. Quick note: Learned this the hard way, but Natasha can only use GY effect after being ritual summoned."

Effectively locking your opponent out of their extra deck and having a spell negate ready if they attempt to use lighting storm to remove it and Wisel. The deck all round does well against the meta, especially adamancipator for obvious reasons and being able to play through its negates going second.

Does pretty well. Omni HEROES.,"I dunno. Just go second and go for an OTK. Summon Solid Soldier, then SS Stratos. Either add Faris, or if you have Faris in the hand, add Drawhand. When fusing into Sunrise, use Solid Soldier and Drawhand. Then summon Drawhand from the grave using Solid Soldier. Before doing all that, you need to link into Wonder Driver. I've seen Cross Crusader seeing play in other HERO decks, but it just takes way too much.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ZfTbyGxZ8</a>"

Do you want to combo off with dinos AND resolve servant in a 60 card deck? Me neither; but you can! The Pend G,"Disclaimer: I did not make this list. This horrifyingly beautiful array of cards was produced by Trif Gaming during one of his live streams on youtube. While I did suggest some cards that are played here - I very happily do not claim ownership of this build. With that being said: here's the self-proclaimed 'Free Win.deck' or as the majority calls it, Trif's Pendulum Pick N' Mix!  Where do I even start..? On his recent stream, Trif Gaming got drunk decided that it was time he revealed the real best deck. He knew it would be controversial; that it would change the way yugioh is played forever, and flip the format on its head. The people called it the Anti-Meta Meta Deck of 2020. Wars were cancelled. Televisions stopped broadcasting. The world stood still and time froze.....are all things I would've said. I'm gonna be honest this is just a bunch of engines thrown together with the focus of turboing out Halqifibrax. I don't know how this deck manages to work its so perplexing. Here's how the basic combo works:  Using one of your several starters in the deck - you find a way to get into Crystron Needlefiber. Once it's been summoned, you do your standard synchro climbing (drawing off of cards like Formula Synchron, Coral Dragon and the level 9 whose name became overly complicated in the TCG) until you manage to make True King of all Calamities. Because of how overtly complex this deck actually is, you will mostly likely waste 12 of your extra deck slots just trying to pull off the combo. Once you do however, you'll realise that you've been left with the rest of your hand and an unused pend summon. Hmm, maybe this is the real best deck after all..? From this point on you basically make do with what you have. Usually the only things worth it are summoning an Ultimate Conductor Tyranno for its spicy flip effect, and using Servant of Endymion to summon a Mighty Master. If you do not open any of these however: do not worry. Pendulum are known for their amazing draw ability. In this...cluster of cards, you run a total of 12 different draw spells! Thats right! And not only that, 22 card that search. Despite this being sixty cards: you'll find what your looking for. Or not. Desires can be irritating I get your pain.  If you feel daring enough, you can tweak some of the ratios in the Extra Deck. I'd mainly advise sticking to Selene, Accesscode and Cerberus - as you go into them the least and they are not imperative for the combo. Selene is the least-used one, because its primarily there only to summon out a Mighty Master after its been used for souls. Cerberus is also pretty interchangeable. You can replace it with another link 2 or Phoenix if you really want, but the people decided that it was the most impactful Knightmare this format. And Accesscode talker is only there to OTK and blow your opponents board up. I would try to keep Accesscode over something like Borrelsword, solely because its harder to resolve its effect and OTK during the same turn. Plus Accesscode can technically be made with 3 materials using something like Selene and a spellcaster summon from the GY.  Overall: this deck is like a 4.2/10 who am I kidding. I wouldn't recommend taking this to a legitimate tournament unless your aspiration is to go X-5 and get laughed at. The deck is consistent yeah, but its recovery is too poor for it to be any form of good. It falls flat to handtraps and has too many choke-points in the combo. The only reason I made this upload was mostly as filler and to have a little fun. The stream this was made on was really late at night, so not many people got to see the deck in action. I also wanted to get my next few decks prepared because i'm going to try to get back to daily decklists starting from Friday. Don't forget to check out Trif Gaming too: he posts some cool Pendulum lists on his channel and does a lot of fun interactive streams a lot of the time. Even though its not that optimal, I'd recommend you still try out the deck. Its very fun and feels pretty rewarding once you manage to make the endboard. Have a great evening/night/morning/day and dont forget to Tune in tsoon to catch some <em>actual </em>good decks."

This deck sports plenty of draw power and damage without opening itself up to S/T destruction vulnerability. Nearly every Trap card can be chained to any attempt to destroy it.  Digging into the build, the first part of the deck is 3 Mystic Mines, 1 Metaverse and 2 Demise of Land. The reason I am not running 3 Demise of Land or 1 Terraforming is because of consistency issues. Having a 3:3 ratio on cards that can search for Metaverse reduces the risk of bad opening hands. An ideal ""going first"" opening hand will have one search card and no physical copies of Mystic Mine. A single Field Barrier is in the deck to protect Mystic Mine from destruction.  Moving over, we get to the cards that draw. Be careful with Pot of Extravagance. It is a good card to play if you have a Pot of Duality in hand, but if you have several other draw cards, play those instead. Card of Demise is easy to play due to the heavy S/T usage. If you have Swift Scarecrow in hand, though, it is okay to hold off for a turn to play it. Contract With Don Thousand is an incredibly overlooked card for burn decks that stall or any deck that needs to tighten up its consistency a bit. It can also lock the opponent out of their Normal Summons if played strategically. It could be a consideration for trimming back the deck a bit in favor of a Watch Dog if you find yourself getting clogged hands with it often. The 1000 damage to each player is nice, and can even finish off an opponent or push for a tie in dire times. Consider using this with Firecracker and Chain Strike for a strong finishing-blow. Balance of Judgement is here to stock up your hand after a non-fatal push. It is not uncommon to draw 4 cards with it if played after unleashing a series of S/Ts on the enemy. This is probably the easiest card to side out if needed.  Next, we come to the damage dealing S/T cards. These are my personal picks for high-damage output. I find Ceasefire and Just Desserts are great for ending a game. If you ever find yourself with 4 of these at any time, you are probably in a position to push for the win. Of course it is more likely that you will need to rely on other damage sources as well, so don't worry too much about amassing all of your damage at once. Cauldron of the Old Man replaces Wave-Motion Cannon as the <em>de facto </em>Continuous Spell damage king. It can also provide a small health boost if you are unable to deal damage for any reason, including if you played One Day of Peace before playing this card. This also provides a useful distraction for splitting an opponent's S/T destruction. Chain Strike should be saved until it can do the most damage or until you can finish an opponent off with it.  Now we get to the stall cards. Waboku, Threatening Roar and Swift Scarecrow can be really irritating to face off against, as even if the opponent manages to get rid of Field Barrier and Mystic Mine, these cards can be there waiting to give full protection for the rest of the turn. Additionally, the trap cards can be used to ""poor-man"" a chain together for Chain Strike damage in a pinch. I have, myself, used Swift Scarecrow, chained Waboku, chained Threatening Roar, chained Balance of Judgement to ultimately end with Chain Strike and deal a respectable 2000 damage and end a game. It is also important to remember that Waboku and Threatening Roar can be activated if targeted for destruction themselves. Though rare, you can also use Waboku if another card is targeted by Night Beam and then chain that card to Waboku to bypass the ""you cannot activate the targeted card in response"" part of the effect.  The last card is Magic Jammer. It is pretty straightforward as a layer of protection for Mystic Mine, but it also has value when used on Cauldron of the Old Man. Not only does it provide protection, but it also provides the same type of counter that Cauldron of the Old Man uses to calculate damage/recovery. This might seem nominal, but it is worth noting. Also, if Mystic Mine and Field Barrier are both on the field, Field Barrier is the better choice for protection, as it passes that protection to Mystic Mine and continues to stop the opponent from playing their own Field Spell.  The extra deck is more-or-less intended to be used for Pot of Extravagance. That doesn't mean that you can't find niche uses for it, however. If your opponent uses anything that can generate tokens on your field, you can use the Extra Deck to keep your numbers low. Decks running Black Garden are the biggest perpetrator of this scenario.  The Side Deck is just what I am using right now. It should evolve with the meta to account for any weaknesses you might find in the deck. I have an alternative build that removes the ten burn cards to change into a passive deck out deck, so there are a lot of options for the side. Find what works for your ""play environment""."

What if you wanted to see how fast and stylishly you can race to the 500 tables? What if you wanted to, rather than win every game you play, try to <em>lose</em> every game you play, in the most artful and combo-reliant way possible?</span>  <span>With this deck profile, I hope to do just that. Introducing the first build of the <strong>Gale Dogra SelFTK!</strong></span>  <span>The way I went about building the deck is that I set some basic guidelines when building a SelFTK deck, which are as follows:</span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong>No surrendering.</strong> That sorta defeats the purpose of making a deck in the first place, y’know? And if your opponent gets the resources for a legit win against you because you bricked, then it’s customary to sit there and take it.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>No draws. </strong>There’s a reason Konami banned Self-Destruct button from tournaments, and if this sorta thing blows up I don’t want to be responsible for a whole TON of ruling knightmares.</span></li> </ol> <span>The idea behind it is simple enough: use all sorts of discard and draw cards to access Gale Dogra. then use it’s effect to clear out most of your lifepoints before going into Verte Anaconda to mill a fusion spell and secure yourself the Big L. We achieve this ideal combo by using Goblindberg to summon itself and GD to set everything up for going into Verte, or failing that we use a whole plethora of Danger! monsters to both put bodies on the board and dig for GD.</span>  <span>There is an alternative, but less fun backup combo to use Gale Dogra to send a Herald of the Arc Light and get a Impcantation Chalislime into the hand, summon another Impcantation through it’s in-hand effect, and then passing turn to take more than enough damage to clinch the loss. And if THAT fails, then you at least have a few floodgates that can help you stall for at least a turn to hopefully find a way to get a Dogra on the board.</span>  <span>The main weak point of the deck right now is that there is no reliable way to get GD on the field without having to do more work than it’s worth, and the entire idea of the deck works best when your opponent is unaware that you’re trying to give the win to them. So going into an overly complicated combo for that GD might face some heavy disruption to end your turn early, and we don’t want our opponent to destroy us! We can destroy ourselves just fine, thank you very much!</span>  <span>This is currently a pretty rough deck since it’s basically an entirely new strategy, so advice for future build and other ideas for SelFTK decks would be greatly appreciated!</span>"

I'm Brazilian, sorry for the bad English.  <span class=""tlid-translation translation"" lang=""en"">In this deck there are 3 main offensive cards: Bergamot (6), Marjoram (Synchro) and Rosemary (Synchro). These are the essential cards that will give your chance of victory. Allied to them you can count on 2 main magic cards (Aroma Gardening and Cauldron of Old Man), 1 field card (Aroma Garden) and 2 traps (Blessed winds and Dried Winds), If things get too complicated and you start to lose , it's good to have these spells on the field.</span>  Don't forget, Aromages activate their effects only when you gain LP, which makes you very dependent on magic cards, have a good strategy before putting your magic cards on the field.  Despite having many cards, this is an easy-to-use deck to get the card you need, either with the help of the Humid Winds trap, or with Jasmine (Link), Lonefire Blossom also helps a lot in quick summons, and learn to correctly use all the effects of each monster, especially Angelica (single tuner monster). To guarantee your victory, always hold a ""Dark Ruler No More"" in your hand and for the protection of your monsters count on the Fairy Box.  Well, I think that's it. This is my favorite deck. take good care of him &#x2665;"

This deck is a combination of Machinas and Infinitracks, with a bit of rank 10 train support added in. These three archetypes have incredible consistency, as they are all earth machines and don't lock each other out of summoning. The strategy would be to use Machina air carrier or Megaform to get out citadel, which can nuke your opponent and bring itself back easily. The superdreadnoughts are easy to bring out, what with the trains and railroad stampede. Then you cana get liebe from either of the superdreadnoughts, which can easily get itself to over 8000 attack. It has no built-in protection, but that can easily be fixed with Infinitrack goliath and outrigger extension, both of which are searchable. With all of these Xyz Monsters, it is relatively easy to bring out Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, which in this current meta is nightmarishly difficult to remove. The searchers in this deck are Machina metalcruncher, Infinitrack Harvester, Machina redeployment, Machina air carrier, and revolving switchyard. Finally, infinitrack tunneller can recycle things in the graveyard, and lets you draw two cards at the same time. The seven sins is summoned by using Harvester and Anchor Drill, and is a 4k beatstick with good removal effects and protection.  The extra deck cards are replaceable if you think you have a better idea, but I recommend keeping infinitrack goliath and the the superdreadnoughts.

Most Tenyi monster is also lvl 4 which means Gallant Granite can consistently makes its Halq play because they are free summon just like Burning Abyss and even have their own tuner. But the Halq combo we use is to avoid bringing light/dark attribute since its the attribute we wanna lock our opponent from.  Combo is we make Halq, ss O-Lion, make Linkross ss 2 tokens, make Martial Mech, ss O-lion and O-Lion token, make Garden Rose Maiden add Black Garden, use Black Garden, make Crystal Wing, make Vermillion Dragon Mech (machine for Auroradon), use Black Garden ss Garden Rose. From this, you can ss and use Protos to pop Linkross and locking opponent from light attribute (but you need another extender to keep Protos on field, as we need it to make Barricadeborg). Then make Barricadeborg (now we have link 2 machine + Vermillion Dragon Mech), use Garden Rose gy eff ss Crystal Wing, make Auroradon ss 3 tokens, tribute Auroradon + 1 token and ss another O-Lion from deck, last step is we make synchro lv 8 Dragite (can use Borreload Savage or Tenyi if we dont declare dark with Protos).  End board is we have Protos light or dark lock along with Crystal Wing + Dragite.  <img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/f/f0/Shouma.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Very consistent in pulling Halq combo, can play going first or second thanks to Vishuda access, Protos lock is lingering effect and can choose many attribute to lock thanks to Tenyi variance, grind game is okay-ish thanks to Adhara (can recover Protos from banished too).  Cons: Eldlich/Dragma only suffers a bit and can still play even if you lock them from light.  &nbsp;"

Activate cauldron of the old man to gain TONS of LP, and deal out plenty of damage as well.  Use child's play to gain more LP, while making your monsters untouchable when working with cauldron.  Use pyro monsters to work together creating a chain of damage.  Since raging flame sprite is a three star it can attack regardless of gravity bind, and attacks LP directly, doing more damage over time.  Summon lava golem to your opponents field, dealing 1000 damage every turn.  With this combo, you should be relatively untouchable, while dealing a good amount of damage each turn. Plus, with gravity bind, you can constantly gain LP, while being able to switch freely to damage!  Hope you like the deck :) leave advice in the comments.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"
