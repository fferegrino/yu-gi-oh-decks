The ""Elementsabers"" are an archetype of Warrior monsters, all featuring effects that have discard costs and the ability to change their own Attribute once they are in the graveyard. They work closely together with the ""Elemental Lords"", which bring powerful effects but can only be summoned if the player has at least five monsters of the respective Attribute in the graveyard. There are also various other monsters that care about the right number of Attributes in the graveyard, some of which I will mention in this decklist.</p> <p>Since I focussed on the ""Elementsaber"" part, I run quite a few of the archetypal monsters: ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Molehu"">Elementsaber Molehu</a>"" is absolutely necessary at three in my opinion and has save me and other players from harm by being a ""<a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a>"" with legs, being able to stop both attacks and certain effects from happening. I also run two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Makani"">Elementsaber Makani</a>"", who is the main searcher, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Malo"">Elementsaber Malo</a>"", who is a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" on legs and can therefore fill the graveyard quite efficiently, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Aina"">Elementsaber Aina</a>"", who is tasked with reviving members from the graveyard and can even Special Summon ""Elemental Lord"" monsters from the graveyard if they were correctly summoned before, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Lapauila"">Elementsaber Lapauila</a>"", our backrow negate and a very helpful member to have, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Nalu"">Elementsaber Nalu</a>"", who can recover ""Elemental Lords"" that were not correctly summoned from the graveyard for another try but is overall only really useful due to being a Water monster. The lynchpin of the ""Elementsaber"" strategy is ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Lapauila Mana"">Elementsaber Lapauila Mana</a>"", who can technically give your entire board protection from battle destruction, effect destruction and/or protection from being targeted.</p> <p>If you ask yourself how this is supposed to work since all those monsters will drain your hand like crazy, then I can only say that you are correct but we have a solution for this problem: ""<a data-name=""Palace of the Elemental Lords"">Palace of the Elemental Lords</a>"".  This card is both bread and butter of the deck, since it boosts your board by 200 ATK/DEF for every Attribute in your graveyard, can search monsters for the cost of your next Battle Phase, but most importantly allows you to pay one of the effect costs from the deck instead of your hand once per turn. Use that on ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Lapauila Mana"">Elementsaber Lapauila Mana</a>"" and you have a free choice of which two protection effects you want to go live while also setting up your graveyard with monsters that will also further boost the stats of your monsters on the field. For this reason, I run three copies of the Field Spell plus one copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"", one copy of ""<a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a>"" and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Demise of the Land"">Demise of the Land</a>"". You do want that Field Spell, since the deck is very much lackluster without but more than solid with it on the field.</p> <p>Continuing with the ""boss monsters"", I chose to run one of each of the following: ""<a data-name=""Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord"">Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord</a>"" for hand control, ""<a data-name=""Phosphorage the Elemental Lord"">Phosphorage the Elemental Lord</a>"" for another ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and therefore clearing the field for the beatdown part, ""<a data-name=""Windrose the Elemental Lord"">Windrose the Elemental Lord</a>"" for backrow removal, ""<a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a>"" as a sizeable beater and instant 3+ card destructions, and ""<a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>"" is the Swiss Army Knife of Yugioh monsters in this deck.</p> <p>Aside from the Field Spell and its various searchers, ""<a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart</a>"" can steal opposing monsters both to improve your board and weakening the opposing board, ""<a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>"" works as setup for your graveyard, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is an obviously revival, ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" against the frontrow while a copy of ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" clears the back, ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" since it is a Warrior-type deck we are running here, ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" both as card draw and a recover option for certain monsters, ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" to fill the graveyard, as a summoning help for the ""boss monsters"" and a small boost via ""<a data-name=""Palace of the Elemental Lords"">Palace of the Elemental Lords</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>"" mainly to fill the graveyard, ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" as further backrow removal, and finally one copy of ""<a data-name=""Slash Draw"">Slash Draw</a>"" which serves as way to manipulate the graveyard by adding more monsters while shuffling Spells and Traps back into the deck. The only cards in the backrow department I run two copies of are ""<a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>"" since I can get some ""Elementsaber"" monsters back into my hand by simply changing their Attribute (this excludes ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Molehu"">Elementsaber Molehu</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Malo"">Elementsaber Malo</a>"" since their ATK is too high) and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elemental Training"">Elemental Training</a>"" as another multitool that protects ""<a data-name=""Palace of the Elemental Lords"">Palace of the Elemental Lords</a>"", fetches other ""Elementsabers"" while filling the graveyard and can be blown up to get a sizeable number of monster back into the hand to work with in a pinch.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features various options for board control like ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" to get rid of monsters you cannot destroy, ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" against graveyard-heavy decks, ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" for yet more backrow removal, while ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" features monster removal without being forced into using materials with certain levels. Three of the four Link ""Charmers"" are also present, I only skipped ""Aussa"" since she has no searchable target in the deck with ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Aina"">Elementsaber Aina</a>"" having too much DEF. Aside from the rest of the options, I want to specifically mention ""<a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a>"", who can use two of the smaller ""Elementsaber"" monsters, boost himself up to sizeable amounts of ATK and fills the graveyard with further cards to work with while doing so.</p> <p>""Elementsabers"" feel like a solid deck to play and to give to beginners, since they are fairly straightforward, overall follow the same principle for their effects and feature two playstyles in both Aggro and Control. They certainly did not live up to the hype they received shortly before being released, but I still feel that the deck, albeit slow, can perform rather well if you have some luck on your side since you will build boards that a good amount of decks and archetypes might struggle with.

Now, almost 20 years after, these are the only cards i have left. I know this is not a real playable, too many monsters, few spell and traps, but if you want go back in time and feel like that child again, you can use this deck, you will enjoy it. This is a travel in time, not only a deck, it's also a true story.  EDIT: I decided to add a ""side deck"" removing the worst 10 monsters and balance the deck the best i can. Now it's 40 cards in main and 10 in side which is still part of the deck. This new version is a lot better to play with."

""Naturia"" is an archetype that consists entirely out of Earth Attribute monsters with various types (but mostly Insect and Plant). From my experience, the ""Naturia"" archetype suffers from a bad reputation due to having some pretty bad cards, but on closer inspection you will find a few solid cards in the bunch that can make for a more than decent deck overall. The goal is to establish your board (preferably during the first turn) to be ready for the opponent taking action, since pretty much all ""Naturia"" cards trigger their effects in reaction to the opponent doing various things.</p> <p>The monster line-up in this deck consists of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cliff"">Naturia Cliff</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"". Both fetch further monsters upon being destroyed or sent to the graveyard, but ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cliff"">Naturia Cliff</a>"" can do the battle searcher strategy of searching copies of itself until the opponent has no more monsters to attack with and then searching some important card, while ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"" increases the monster count on your field by quite an amount and is helpful as tribute for effects, tribute for ""<a data-name=""Naturia Bamboo Shoot"">Naturia Bamboo Shoot</a>"" and simply as more ""Naturia"" monsters for the effect of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Naturia Bamboo Shoot"">Naturia Bamboo Shoot</a>"" locks the opponent from using backrow when summoned by using a ""Naturia"" monster as tribute, which is fairly helpful when you get it off but needs some setup to work while ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" can snatch opposing monsters with 0 DEF and lowers the opposing monster's stats by 300 ATK/DEF per ""Naturia"" monster you control. ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" is therefore immensely important when building your field as it will steal the opposing resources for Link and Synchro summons while also crippling the opposing monster's stats beyond believe when two copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" are available. To make sure that that actually happens, there is ""<a data-name=""Naturia Antjaw"">Naturia Antjaw</a>"" which can summon Level 3 or lower ""Naturia"" monsters whenever the opponent Special Summons (which can be quite a lot to be honest) and therefore can set the entire thing up or via ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"", which can once per turn freely change a Plant/Insect monster against the other type, for example using ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"" to gain ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Naturia Marron"">Naturia Marron</a>"" serves as both a ""Naturia""-specific ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" as well as allowing you to shuffle monsters back into the deck to draw a card, which is helpful both due to the drawn card and allows you to setup ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cliff"">Naturia Cliff</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"" again.</p> <p>Less important but still fairly helpful are the single copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Stinkbug"">Naturia Stinkbug</a>"", which stops the entire Battle Phase by sending itself to the graveyard, ""<a data-name=""Naturia Butterfly"">Naturia Butterfly</a>"", which stops single attacks once per turn but only needs to mill your deck for one card in order to do so, ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sunflower"">Naturia Sunflower</a>"", which is quite costly by asking for two tributes but can stop dangerous board-clears from going through, and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Mantis"">Naturia Mantis</a>"" as a Normal Summon blocker. I also run two copies of ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"", which is useful for Extra Deck plays and will be explained shortly.</p> <p>The backrow features three ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"", both for its summoning and its searching effect when sent to the graveyard, three ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>"", which can trigger the search effect of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for obvious summoning from the graveyard, one ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" since the draw two is always helpful and you have an easy time filling the graveyard which monsters while also being able to reuse the things you shuffled back due to searching, and one ""<a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a>"", which is helpful overall but extra useful during the first turn since you will probably not Special Summon that early and can further improve your hand. The Trap cards aside from ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"" are two copies of ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" to make the Traps searchable and therefore more available, two ""<a data-name=""Back to the Front"">Back to the Front</a>"", which is very nice in combination with ""<a data-name=""Naturia Antjaw"">Naturia Antjaw</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" while the drawback of summoning in defense position is actually a bonus in this case, two ""<a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>"" for a little bit more defense and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>"", which can ditch the copies of ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>"" from the Extra Deck and gives you early card destruction when needed.</p> <p>Going into the Extra Deck, there are the ""Naturia"" main stays in form of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Naturia Barkion"">Naturia Barkion</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Landoise"">Naturia Landoise</a>"", all able to interfere with the opposing strategies in one way or another, ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" which is both the well-known field nuke in this deck while also being able to actually use its other effect should you decide to use it, ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" as a alternative to put on ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" as a stat-booster, ""<a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a>"" for the usual ""steal a monster"" effect and further searching, and the two ""Knightmares"" in form of ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" to have tools against backrow and monsters respectively.</p> <p>The Fusion line-up is where I actually want to talk about the previously mentioned ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"", who can sent Extra Deck monsters straight to the graveyard. You cannot Special summon them anymore if doing so, but in combination with the two copies of ""<a data-name=""Miracle Synchro Fusion"">Miracle Synchro Fusion</a>"", you are able to access both ""<a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Gaiastrio"">Naturia Gaiastrio</a>"" with relative ease. ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"" can also use his effect to ditch the copies of ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>"" for card destruction and the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>"" to search a ""<a data-name=""Miracle Synchro Fusion"">Miracle Synchro Fusion</a>"" with a slight delay, giving you a few interactions to play with.</p> <p>I have to admit that I was somewhat biased in terms of ""Naturia"" before I wrote a card analysis about them, mostly due to reading some of their effects and deeming the archetype terrible because of them, but also because parts of the community do the same and preach that opinion like their were facts. Is ""Naturia"" a rogue-worthy deck? No, not by a long shot. But they are also not as terrible as they are made out to be. What I found the most interesting is that they do have a variety of options you can work with and are useable in various decks. I have zero copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Mosquito"">Naturia Mosquito</a>"" in the deck, but not because I deem the card bad but because I did not find space for it in my build; a ""<a data-name=""Naturia Mosquito"">Naturia Mosquito</a>"" OTK build is certainly gimmicky, but nowhere near impossible.</p> <p>Overall, I like ""Naturia"" and think that they are a solid archetype to use and play with, with the added bonus that most people do not know what about 90% of the deck does, leading to scenarios in which players stack the board with Special Summons only to be blocked by a single ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"".

If going second you should just try to OTK wtih sunrise or trinity. The core is the 29 cards. The last 11 you can use, even the ROTA isn't essential because opening too many searchers is defienantly a brick. Make the last 11 cards anything that will help you against what you play or up the engine if you are having problems with it. Stratos at 3 and e call at three are both bricks does not help you. Stratos at 2 and e call at 2 have been perfect for me but you could also stratos 1 e call 3, or 3 stratos 1 e call. E call is fine to draw multiple off but multiple stratos is a brick. No solid soilder because imperm or veiler solid kills any plays unless you hard drew the fusion destiny. 1 shadow mist because opening one is terrible, the only downside is if you get called by the grave or dd crowed on shadow mist you definently lose out on a searchable mask change. In this case either run the second mist or play the shining instead of cross sheep to get back the shadow mist. The cross sheep in extra deck is for when you resolve gamma on your turn so you can get something out of the driver and gamma. As well as put gamma and driver into the grave so other gammas drawn are live if you happen to lose your board. Also chalice is a irl replacement for imperm, i dont like veiler because it is dead turn 1, and turn 1 chalice is basically imperm and turn 2 chalice is great to slap on problem monsters and then just attack over it with honest neos or trinity. Feel free to comment with suggestions and question!!!! EDIT : ALSO EVIL HERO ENGINE i do not have but if you do just either cut fusion destiny engine and use evil hero engine which i do not recomend, i would either try to cut some engine cards and add it in or play less hand traps and add it in, maybe cut gamma and cross sheep to add them in, and fill in the blanks."

In 2020? Yeah, that happened. In that guy's case, it was effectively just the three Sacred Beast structure decks smashed together. I tried it out, and...wow, a lot better than expected. However, it had some glaring weaknesses. <ol>  	<li>Disrupt that normal summon and you'll scoop.</li>  	<li>Effect Veiler.</li>  	<li>It's a brick house.</li> </ol> So, I figured I'd take a crack at it and see if I could fix those glaring weaknesses. Short version: I couldn't. However, I did add a little more consistency and less risky plays, as well as a few outs to situations that would've bricked the vanilla deck completely.  <strong>PROS: </strong>  You'll raise plenty of eyebrows that you're running a Sacred Beasts deck.  You'll raise more eyebrows if you win.  Not too expensive, and majority of your tech comes from structure decks.  The deck profile is adaptable; need more power output? Add Raviels. Need more control? Swap in a Cerulean Skyfire and another Hamon.  Replacing someone's boss monster with a turtle and then one punching that turtle for an OTK is hilarious.  Extra deck is supplemental, not crucial to your victory. If someone stops your extra deck summons, you still have your win condition.  <strong>CONS:</strong>  Hand traps can absolutely destroy your combos. With Called By The Grave currently at one, if you've already bricked and they hand trap you twice, you're susceptible to an OTK yourself.  Because this is a budget deck list, I've intentionally left out more expensive cards such as Infinite Impermanence, Evenly Matched, and Lightning Storm. As a result, you'll be more vulnerable to these cards. Beware the non-budget player.  Although I've never been shut down by a floodgate, in theory one could disrupt you very badly.  Raviel is your win condition. If you run out of Raviels or otherwise cannot summon one, you have to rely on Hamon or possibly summoning Armityle. Hamon is (relatively) weak and cannot OTK with this deck profile, and Armityle is very rarely a good option. Trilojig is in the same boat; the burn damage is rarely relevant, and he doesn't interact with other cards in the deck all that well.  Deck space is extremely tight. You will very rarely run three copies of anything, as this deck is prone to bricking without versatility. Even then bricks do happen and will cost you the game at least half the time.  No, seriously, <em><strong>Effect Veiler will ruin your day.</strong></em>  <strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong>  If given the choice, go second. If you're stuck going first, your Sacred Beasts are vulnerable to removal, so hopefully you drew a hand trap of your own or some backup searchers. It's debatable what your ideal opening hand would be with this deck. I've modified this deck to be as versatile as possible with whatever hand you get, but ideally you want Raviel Lord of Phantasms, Dark Beckoning Beast, Chaos Summoning Beast, and then you're comfortable with several options depending what you're up against.  Going first, you'll want Called By The Grave or Lost Wind, since this can protect your combo and then help you disrupt your opponent's board. Since deck space is tight, you don't have room for error; think carefully which link in the chain you target. It's not a bad play favoring Hamon over Raviel, since he has high attack that will rarely be run over short of Utopia or a Blue-Eyes boss monster, and this makes a decent fake out for your opponent. If your opponent doesn't know how the deck works, they will likely assume that they're disrupted your win condition significantly. This means they have wasted valuable resources on your decoy, leaving Raviel less competition to punch through.  Going second, you ideally want a Fallen Paradise or a Kaiju; Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, Gameciel, or Radian are all fine. Though Kaiju Slumber has the best results, it is also the easiest to disrupt with a counter trap, but if it goes off you can turtle drop your opponents board, set yourself up with Radian, and then continue play normally. If Kaiju Slumber does get countered....well, at least it didn't hit one of your field or continuous spells. The key goal is to prevent disruption while ensuring you can hit your opponent hard. This deck does poorly against dedicated control, but it can beat over large bodies very easily.  <strong>SHORTHAND TIPS:</strong> <ul>  	<li><em><strong>Fallen Paradise is powerful, but does not make you invincible. It can and will get blasted with Twin Twisters or Mystical Space Typhoon, and usually there is a follow up. Be prepared for that. </strong></em></li>  	<li>Raviel, Lord of Phantasms is your undisputed win condition. It is absolutely imperative that he survives and remains attacking without being disrupted. Your top priority is his attack power, not his tribute or token generation effect. If possible, try to bait your opponent into thinking the opposite.</li>  	<li>Fallen Paradise provides protection and draw power once you have any Sacred Beast out. If possible, prioritize that combo. This is effectively a Pot of Duality without the drawbacks, albeit with more setup.</li>  	<li><em><strong>Don't underestimate Almiraj's ability to protect Raviel.</strong></em> Fallen Paradise can be destroyed, but Almiraj adds another layer of armor. As long as Raviel is on the board and still able to attack, it will eventually bring down your opponent.</li>  	<li>Raviel Shimmering Scraper's attack boost is a quick effect. <em><strong>Remember that you can use this on your opponent's turn and during their battle phase if timed correctly.</strong></em> I've won games when my opponent played a large monster with slightly more attack than Raviel, waited for the opponent to declare their attack, and then used Shimmering Scraper's quick effect to double Raviel's attack and deal a huge blow to the opponent. Sometimes, it wins me the game. Attack boosts are just as defensive as offensive.</li>  	<li><em><strong>Armityle and Trilojig are not your friend and are a last resort. They should never be your goal or win condition.</strong></em><em> </em>Trilojig can only be protected by Mound of the Bound Creator, and provides no advantage other than an unexpected burn on an opponent with low life points. Armityle's 10,000 attack on your turn is a potential OTK...if the attack goes through. Remember, Fallen Paradise only prevents destruction and targeting from cards effects, but not boardwide negates or non-targeting. Your attack can still be negated, which then leaves you with an empty board or a 0 attack monster that is now stuck in attack position. It might not be destroyed by the battle, but <em>you</em> certainly can be.</li>  	<li>Mistake should only be used when absolutely necessary. When well timed, it disrupts your opponent's ability to repair or build their board. When poorly timed or used before your board is properly established, you've disrupted majority of your own deck. <em><strong>You want to draw as much as you search.</strong></em> An ideal board with this deck utilizes a mixture of both. Mistake can be used interchangeably with Hyper Blaze depending on what you're up against.</li>  	<li><strong>Your extra deck is a decoy. </strong>You will not often use it unless the game is already going very bad or very heavily in your favor, and usually it will just be Almiraj to protect your Raviels. However, if your opponent wastes resources disrupting or attacking your extra deck, those resources cannot be spent on preventing your <em>actual</em> win condition. This deck has a lot of weaknesses; mind games are your friend.</li>  	<li>Though the decklist this is based off of won Australia nationals, I would not expect this to become meta any time soon. You could potentially tear up locals, but this deck does not have an answer to Paleozoic Frogs, Salamangreats, Zoodiac AA-Zeus, or any deck with multiple counters in a single turn. To make the most out of this deck, you need to know what you're up against, and a careful disruption followed up by a beefed up Raviel punch is your goal.</li> </ul> And, that's about it. A lot of this deck is trial and error, and I highly recommend you use this against bots or trial games before you dip into locals or higher grade tournaments. I would definitely not recommend more expensive upgrades until you know every trick this deck can throw out and have your plays mapped out at least a turn ahead with every hand. I've left some of the nuance plays out of this, since it really is better learning by experience. This decklist is still very much a first draft and I'm still working it over, but so far I am quite happy with where it landed. <em><strong>I encourage you to comment and post suggestions on ways to alter or improve this deck.</strong></em>  The Sacred Beasts support is a breath of fresh air in the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG, and if Konami sees a positive reaction to vintage archetypes that actually plays well, we might see more older or obscure archetypes become relevant as opposed to casual niche. Either way, enjoy. :)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Including potentially getting a fireable monster + spell + trap wipe on your opponent when you activate it  The way the deck works is if you can resolve Stratos, you just generate a massive amount of resources in searches from your cards, and if you drew the searchables in your hand then you can just generate more resources for yourself.  <span><strong>Advice!</strong></span>  If you DON'T draw into Mask Change in your opening hand or from Liquid Soldier, then go for double Sunrise to protect your monsters a LOT more, otherwise your opponent can pick your board apart slightly by attacking.  God tier hero players draw into Faris in their opening hand with Stratos as well. ;)  &nbsp;  I haven't got a play by play of my best way of playing the deck, but if you all really want a video showing you how to play the combo for this deck, I'll make one so you can see. :D  Until then however I CBA to make one, so if you really really need a tutorial of how to play, just ask and I'll make a video of it"

I wanted it to work. But having Chaos Gate Sunya being destroyed by a monster effect at the same time you can activate Numeron Chaos Ritual, that's just difficult.  <em>Until now</em>. Using the Unchained baby monsters to pop that Chaos Gate, Numeronius is surprisingly easy to get out! It takes 2 turns to set up, 1 to get out the Chaos Gate and 1 to get out Numeronius, and from there it's a quick kill (hopefully). This deck uses a lot of draw power in terms of Memories, Allure, Desires, and Extravagance in order to reach combo pieces, and from there it just comes down to summoning with the cards you get! You also run some dark hand-interruptions in order to enable Allure and also protect yourself."

With Pyro, you can beat a lot of monsters, while also chipping damage. Then, after draining your opponent's resources, summon Over Ro","So this is a fun deck when I'm experimenting stuff for Maximum, and I really love it.  <strong>Deck details</strong>  -Pyro  We have 8 normal Pyro monsters, mainly for Gockboot and Masked Gockboot's effects. By sending a card from the top of your deck, Gockboot grants all Pyro you control 100 ATK per each Normal Monster in GY. Masked Gockboot can send a Normal Pyro to the GY, then deal 1000 damage to your opponent and draw 1 card!  Gockboot allows you to easily clap most monsters in the current format (You might need more for Blue-Eyes, though), and Masked Gockboot allows you to burn your opponent, while also maintaining the card advantage.  We also have a spell, Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Red Hot, for our Pyros. It boosts a Pyro by 300 ATK and let it pierces this turn. This is HUGE, because it brings your Gockboots to at least 2500 ATK, and piercing is another great way to chip your opponent's LP.  -Fiend Package  This is an engine that I use, mostly focus on King's Dignity. It's a powerful trap that negates an attack, just by shuffling a Normal Level 1 Fiend monster from your GY to your Deck. Its really useful to protect your Pyro bosses from attacks, recycling a fodder, or just as simple as block a direct attack. Groupie and Goat are also Normies, so they help Gockboot too!  -Generic cards  Hammer Crush: S/T remover  Spirit Shackles: Reduce ATK, protect your boss or minimize the damage  Trap Hole: This card is great, no cap.  -MAXIMUM  This is our plan B, if our Pyros don't end your opponent yet. Over Road is an OTK machine, that if you use it at the right time, you could finish your opponent's hopes and dreams in just 1 attack!  [L]'s effect is the main effect that can boost this card to absurd ATK value. If you use this when your LP are very low, this card can be devastating!  [R]'s effect is the support effect. It boosts Over Road by the Level of an opponent's monster x 200. Good effect for the OTK!  As for now, Maximums can't be destroyed by traps, so don't worry about Dark Liberation or Offensive Counterstrike. Milk your opponent's resources with Pyros, then perform your winning move with Over Road!  <strong>Matchups:</strong>  Spellcasters  In game 1, it may be best to defend using Spirit Shackles and King's Dignity. Most Spellcasters don't have high ATK values to threaten you, so you can simply avoid attacking till you draw your Over Road. It might be hard to bait Dark Lib out, because your Pyro bosses have 0 DEF, but you can try to snipe with Hammer Crush, or just wait till Over Road.  Side deck options: Whispering Fairy (shuffle Spellcasters in opponent's GY), Defensive Dragon Mage (protect your monster from Dark Lib by sending a Spellcaster. In this case it will be Whispering Fairy or another copy of itself), Simoom of the Genie + Groupie (6 Fiends should help you trigger Genie to bounce stuff easier)  Dragons:  This is a hard matchup, because most Pyros' base ATK is too low against Dragon bosses (they usually have at least 2k4). Shocklead is also another out to our boss monster, so our best bet is, of course, Maximum. Try to use your Gockboots to destroy as many Dragon bosses as possible, though, because just setting alone won't be enough against Dragears. You most likely will have low LP after the assault, so your Over Road will guarantee an OTK.  Not too much to side (in our deck) against Dragons, so you can only depend on your Main Deck  Maximum Cyberse:  This is the newest deck, by the time I'm writing this. Its goal is to turbo out their Maximum Boss, Ygg the Heavenly Dragon Emperor Tree, asap by using -tron monsters. -tron monsters are those that let you dig through your deck quicker for Maximum pieces. Although, they all require Femtron in the GY, and they need no other monsters on their field to trigger their -tron effects.  You only need to avoid attacking Femtron, and always try to leave a monster on your opponent's field to block their effects (Picock Hightron can bypass this, but at that point you should have more resources). If they manage to assemble Ygg though, then its kinda hard to out. Not many things can out a 4k beast, that has Torna-like effect and a free pop each turn, but Over Road can counter Ygg fairly well. King's Dignity is your lifesaver, as it blocks Ygg from attacking, giving you more chances to fight back.  Side deck options: Innocent Lancer (a Pyro monster that pierces), Torna. These monsters can put -tron monsters to a clock, because they can't simply set pass to survive, and most Maximum Cyberse decks don't have another boss monster, making these monsters very threatening!  Fiend:  A tricky deck to face. Its playstyle focuses on Heavymetal, a powerful boss that can pop the monster with the lowest Level on your field and gain its ATK. They have good recursion with Punk, reduction with Death Voice, themed MST, and possibly King's Dignity. They also have a strong card: Epic Demon's Rock, that can nuke all field by sending 2 Fiends when you Normal Summon a monster. It is detectable thought, because your opponent needs to keep at least 2-3 cards in their hand. Fiend can also play Beast Gear World, which can boost their monsters by 300.  Fiend sounds very strong, but our Pyros can always beat them with less requirement (Fiends need to tribute a lv5+ for their effects), and Spirit Shackles is a deadly card as most Fiend decks only play them pure. Also, when Over Road is played, it's likely game over because Royal Demons only affect Level 8 or lower monsters. Overall, a decent matchup for us.  Side deck options: Our main deck can fight it already well, but you can toss in 1-2 Genie if you are scared of Epic Demon's Rock  Mirror (Pyro):  Pyro doesn't have their own Traps yet, so it is the battle of who can sack faster with their Noodles. Our traps can be valuable, as Pyro loves their Normies (which are likely Pyro) in their GY, and Dignity can block an attack towards your Gockboots. If they have Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Heartburn-Inducing Pork Roast Fat though, they can greatly reduce your monster's ATK, including Over Road  Side deck options: Our Main Deck can already handle Pyros well with our traps, and a right-time Over Road can still OTK.  Psychic:  Psychic is like Pyro, both are sacky decks, but Psychic has Dividing Psychic Wall that can boost their monster by 500 ATK. Not too much different from Pyro Mirror then, just be aware of your opponent's LP to avoid triggering unintended Psychic effects.  Chair, Beetle:  These are the same type of deck, but with different bosses. Those decks tend to gather as much 0 ATK / Level 1 monsters (Chair / Beetle), then unveil their bosses at the last minute. However, they are slow decks, so you can bombard them with Gockboots (especially chipping with Masked Gockboot). Red Hot is a great card in this matchup, because it grants your Pyro piercing ability, and add it up with high ATK, you should crush them before they even get to their bosses.  Speaking of bosses, they are deadly if use correctly. Saturn King Beetle, Beetle's boss, can let a monster gains 100 ATK per Level 1 monsters in the GY (usually they pair it with Dragears with its double attack ability, or smack with the Beetle itself). Chair's boss, Dayu, combo with Throne of Darkness can be deadly (at the first glance), because they help Dayu to 4k ATK (and if you combo well with Shield &amp; Sword...6k4 Dayu and 2k5 Throne...) The thing is, at the end of the turn Dayu/Throne are back to 0 ATK, and Beetle goes to 1700 ATK, so they are very prone to any attacks.  Side deck options: Innocent Lancer and Torna. As listed in Maximum Cyberse section, they are useful to punish slow plays from opponent  Cat: Fuck them  <strong>Thoughts</strong>  The secret to use Maximum in the most effective way is combining it with an aggressive deck. Pyro is the perfect deck to chip your opponent away, while also doesn't need brick or need too many core cards.

Amongst the viral outbreaks and political unrest, I and several others have found security, entertainment, and catharsis in the form of these ""VTuber"" lassies that've been popping up all year. Seems I too have fallen into that rabbit hole and shall forever tumble into the paradises of precious dogs, sharks, grim reapers, or whatever semi-fictional friends tend to grace the interwebs.  So how fitting was it that Konami happened to release an archetype revolving around them? Debuting in Genesis Impact opposite side of various magician retrains and the umpteenth strategy that can benefit from Cyber Emergency and inevitably make CDI, the adorable and equally as hard to type out on keyboard ""Live☆Twins"" are quite the pair. And with them, a super-secret agenda. When the sun goes down, they ditch the cartoonish personas and don their true colors, the ""Evil★Twins"". Now tell me that wasn't clever making the first word reversed to show their real intentions. In any case, when it's time to pilfer some goodies, Ki-sikil and Lil-la tap into the Extra Deck to cause some mayhem together, best exacerbated when they're both on the field upon summon.  But they don't do it alone, no no. The fact that the ""Lives"" have the stat line they do (Level 2 and Cyberse) means they can call upon some familiar friends that've been helping out Cyberse sillies like Code Talkers since the dawn of Link Summoning. This opens up a whole new world of options that extend far beyond cute characters playing games for laughs and such.  So with that, I give you what's possibly one of my favorite ""bite back if your opponent tries anything nasty"" decks other than Time Thieves, the Live☆/Evil★Twins.  As with my previous decklist, I'll opt to go in order of archetypes and their main cards to fully understand their roles and rewards if everything goes off without a hitch.  &nbsp; <h1>Live☆Twins</h1> Complete with cutesy artwork reminiscent of Panty and Stocking and lots of terminology that will hopefully be properly localized to creative effect, the Live☆Twins are undoubtedly your play starters and take center stage when setting up. More often than not, you'll want to normal summon one of the two Main Deck Live☆'s, first and foremost. That's when their friends step in and the fun really starts. <ul>  	<li>With twin tails and an outfit that belongs in an early 2000's Sega game, <span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Ki-sikil"">Live☆Twin Ki-sikil</a></span> is here to spread smiles they way I do peanut butter on toast. When she's Normal or Special Summoned as the only monster on your field, she calls upon her counterpart, Lil-la from hand or deck. Alternatively, she grants you 500 LP whenever your opponent declares an attack. But as you can likely tell going forward, it and the other secondary effects of the Main Deck Live☆'s are what you're really going to focus on.</li>  	<li>Ki-sikil's sailor dress-wearing, bread-misplacing, and complementary-colored companion is <span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la"">Live☆Twin Lil-la</a></span>. Summoning her as your sole monster, much like our previous member, allows her to bring out Ki-sikil from hand or deck much like the pinkie. Her other effect that requires your opponent to pay a 500 LP toll for attacks really isn't worthwhile either, but hopefully our next member will tie up some loose ends.</li>  	<li>A spooky re-skin, <a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat""><span>Live☆Twin Lil-la</span> <span>Treat</span></a> is a freebie summon provided you have a Ki-sikil on your field. Despite its Zombie typing, you're more than able to use it for your Link summons involving what you normally would for Lil-la and the like. Though if you ask me, you might want to save one of these on the field for an upcoming Trap card that can come in a surprising, unconventional pinch.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <ul>  	<li>For backrow, rounding us off is <span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Home"">Live☆Twin Home</a></span>. It's moreso your emergency button if you've no other way to go into Ki-sikil or Lil-la from deck at present, though it requires a discard for cost and locks your Extra Deck summons for the remainder of the turn into the Twins' sinister counterparts. Still though, it can get the job done when you need.</li>  	<li>And possibly the best segue into the upcoming section of this profile is <span><a data-name=""Secret Password"">Secret Password</a></span>. It lets you add any Live☆Twin or Evil★Twin backrow card from deck to hand. Alternatively, if you happen to have a Ki-sikil and Lil-la on your field, it grants you the additional option of a Main Deck beater that gives itself extra stacks and offers non-targeting, non-destruction equalization. But as Mickey Mouse once famously said, ""That's a surprise tool that'll help us later.""</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h1>Evil★Twin</h1> Ki-sikil and Lil-la's nighttime gig takes center stage once they're all set up and ready to go into their extensive arsenal of blue friends from the Extra Deck. That's when they reveal their true intentions and selves, the Evil★Twins. On the surface, they may seem underwhelming, but that's where all their supportive tools come in. For now though, I'd be more than happy to describe both these pretty pilferers. It should be noted that any and all kinds of monsters can be used for their summons, provided their second material has Ki-sikil and Lil-la in the name. <ul>  	<li>No longer a pretty pink princess, <span><a data-name=""Evil★Twin Ki-sikil"">Evil★Twin Ki-sikil</a></span> has gems in her eyes and domination on her mind. When she hits the field while your Lil-la monster is out and about as well, she allows you to draw a card for free. Alternatively, her Quick Effect lets you summon any Lil-la monster from your GY so long as you have none on your field, yet locks you into Fiends from the Extra Deck for the turn's remainder. This is the one you'll want to have out during your opponent's turn at all times, with this next member in the GY...</li>  	<li>Back to bite as hard as her mascot, <span><a data-name=""Evil★Twin Lil-la"">Evil★Twin Lil-la</a></span> is capable of summoning her pink friend from the GY if one of her naming is absent from your field much like the previous pinkie. But more often than not, she's the one you want to bring out with Evil Ki-sikil's effect during your opponent's turn. As soon as she hits the field then, she pops any card on the field, face-down or face-up. It's practically a free disruption, and it actually is in-theme with another powerful upcoming Link monster.</li>  	<li>Rarely popping up but typically helping clean up games when they do, the Main Deck titan <a data-name=""Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la"">Evil★Twins <span>Ki-sikil</span> &amp; <span>Lil-la</span></a> have one last bone to pick with your opponent before their heist sees its conclusion. They summon themselves from hand or GY by tributing two of your Link monsters, and should they come up while your opponent has three or more cards, they render all but two of them over and done with. Not only that, but if you're clear to attack for game with them, they can strike with a whopping 4400 ATK provided you have a Ki-sikil and Lil-la in the grave. High attack might not mean too much nowadays, but hey. Why not? Also, I haven't read anything confirming or denying it, but these two poser performers are likely a cute criminal couple, and I've nothing but support for it.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <ul>  	<li>Packing a surprise for your opponent in your backrow and searchable with Secret Password is <span><a data-name=""Evil★Twin Present"">Evil★Twin Present</a></span>. It's more or less a tribal, chainable Creature Swap if you have both the twins up on your side of the field. By swapping control of one of your Ki-sikil or Lil-la's with one of your opponent's tools, you can opt for a non-destruction disruption for their setup that can leave them with something potentially weak and useless, like Live Ki-sikil or Lil-la Treat. Alternatively, it can also shuffle an opponent's set backrow into the deck if you'd prefer that. But I mostly prefer the former effect due to a Quick Effect-bearing Link helper's effect that's more than worthwhile.</li> </ul> <h1>Main Deck Mainstays</h1> The Live☆Twins tend to look forward to a good bit of assistance from Main Deck stuff that complements their game plan and gets extra material on the board so their helpful Links can take their place. So while those cuties are off goofing around for views, let's view the ones who help them behind the scenes. <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Backup Secretary"">Backup Secretary</a></span>, essentially the A-Chan of the two stars of the show, benefits from her clients being Cyberse by summoning herself from the hand for free if one of them happens to be on the field. Though it's a hard once-per-turn, she more than comes in handy for getting extra generic material for your summons out of the way.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyberse Converter"">Cyberse Converter</a> is like the Performage Hat Tricker for Cyberse monsters, summoning himself for free if your field has nothing but, well, Cyberse monsters. I wouldn't say he'll be brought out too often, but that's not to say his utility in the deck is absent. Play what you like, how you like as I say.</li>  	<li>Particularly useful during your later turns, <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> revives a L2 or lower monster of choice from your GY at the cost of that monster's effects. Not only does it bring out your Main Deck Live☆Twins again, but using it for a Link after it's done its job gets you a free token much like some other useful cards here that you can use for yet more summons. I swear, Cyberse is up there with Warrior and Dragon for most supported Types in the game.</li>  	<li>A card that's thankfully a Common and useful regardless of what Link or Xyz deck you may be playing that you can find room for it in, <span><a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a></span> brings itself out from the hand should you Link summon to a zone your Link monster points to. Immediately after that, it can halve its entire stat line to bring out another one of itself from deck to extend your plays. Try it out with the first two spots on the upcoming generic Link section, it'll be a blast.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <ul>  	<li>With all the low-level Cyberse monsters that you'll be using to round off your games, it goes without saying that <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> comes in great handy. Thankfully more common than ever, it nets you a Level 4 or lower Cyberse monster from deck, including your Live☆Twins though is a hard once-per-turn. Sadly Parallel eXceed is exempt from this card's searching capabilities, but it's quite alright since there are other ways to see your setups through.</li>  	<li>Nothing says ""instant free LINK-1 material"" quite like <a data-name=""One-Time Passcode"">One-Time Passcode</a>. Its activation gives you a L4 Cyberse token that can be used for, well, LINK-1's or whatever your Extra Deck calls for next. Not too much to say, though you're more than welcome to swap this out for something else if it's not quite your cup of tea.</li>  	<li>With this deck, there are backrow cards and powerful summons you do NOT want to be on the receiving end of. So for the time being until this archetype probably gets a tribal Counter Trap the way Time Thieves did, <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> will be filling in that void just fine. The cost of half your LP for the protection of your field may sound scary, but keep in mind that these days, the only Life Point that really matters is your last one. So a generic, practically risk-free way to say ""No"" to your opponent's attempts to be a meanie is always welcome.</li>  	<li>To keep your materials and other such important monsters going after they've already been dispatched by your opponent, cards like <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> and <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> are plenty worthwhile if you can squeeze in the space.</li>  	<li>Pot of Avarice sees play here in case you need to restock your respective decks with their important tools that have hit the grave, and a net of two draws. You likely won't be using it too often despite its Unlimited status it's gotten in recent months, but it's still alright to have on standby when you need.</li> </ul> <h1>Extra Deck Mainstays</h1> Comprising your bread and butter setups will be these guys, thanks to the stat lines of most of your Cyberse monsters and the Live☆Twins themselves. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> and <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> both go hand-in-hand, hence why you're going to want to summon one and then the other once you can snag the chance to get some low-level Cyberse monsters on the field. The former tributes the latter to let you replace a card from your hand with one from your deck, and the latter upon being tributed brings out two tokens you can immediately use for another Link summon, although at the cost of your access to anything higher than a LINK-2 for the rest of the turn. But that's quite alright, because that effect is mitigated by the upcoming entry that's perfect for summoning immediately after.</li>  	<li>Also blessed by her newfound lower rarity and the ability to be brought out using solely tokens or Main Deck monsters, <span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span>'s utility cannot be understated. During your opponent's Main Phase, she tags herself and other monsters on your field out for another Link monster of choice from your Extra Deck, with the added benefit of being immune to card effect destruction. The way I typically like to go about it is either using a spare Lil-la monster on field with her for the Link Summon, or an opponent's monster I snatched with Present to further add insult to injury in a way. You can pilot her how you like in this regard, but I like to think this sly method's just oh-so satisfying.</li>  	<li>The fellow Fiends, <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a></span>, and <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a></span> don't mind Evil Ki-sikil or Lil-la's restriction at all, and are more than happy to lend their support. They each pitch a card from hand to shuffle a card on field into the deck, pop a backrow card, or pop a Special Summoned monster in the Main zone respectively, with the added benefit of drawing a card if they were co-linked in the process. Masquerena complements these cards perfectly, as a way of chainable removal during your opponent's turn as it's always been. Not to mention Phoenix and Cerberus can protect all your co-linked monsters just like the next entry.</li>  	<li>Finally, a beefy Cyberse Link monster to join the roster. <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> can be summoned with either Masquerena during your opponent's turn or using whatever you happen to have on field in reserve during yours, whichever you like. His arrows pointing up and to his right-hand side work for his effect well, as whatever's co-linked to him gains 500 ATK and can't be targeted by your opponent's card effects. So just by being there, your Ki-sikil, Lil-la, or any of your other beneficial Link monsters can stick it to your opponent's targeting disruptions. Not only that, but he can also revive a LINK-3 or lower Cyberse Link from your GY during your turn, including Masquerena! Though you'll want to be a little careful, because you can only summon Cyberse monsters before and after you use this effect. Still though, he's pretty dang helpful when the moment calls for him. Like the teeniest bit of coriander in a curry.</li>  	<li>You likely won't bring out <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> too much, but he's definitely got his uses. He revives a Main Deck Cyberse monster in Defense, but only locks you into Cyberse monsters for the rest of the turn. If you're starving for options, he's good to go into and then advance to higher stuff afterwards.</li>  	<li>Now for a big, big, terrifying Fiend that Ki-sikil and Lil-la have been lucky to tame. <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a> which should have been the name for Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon is undoubtedly a huge asset to the deck once you've got the materials for him. Card gets destroyed by battle? He can pop a card of choice. Card gets destroyed by another effect? He's there for that as well! The turn's over? You uh, likely get the point. Three stacks are pretty crazy for an ATK value, and his ability to pop another card right after Evil Lil-la, Phoenix, or Cerberus do is pretty dang helpful if you ask me. It's up to you whether you want to summon him to a linked zone or the Extra Monster zone, but either way he gets the job done.</li>  	<li>As far as the remaining slots, feel free to play whatever other Links you like. <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> the only Salamangreat monster I respect for chainable protection, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> for late-game cleanups (even if Accesscode is basically the new Borrelsword that'll rattle your wallet even harder), or any other generic helpers you see fit.</li> </ul> So, them's the cards and what they do for the deck. But before I close out this article, much like last time, I wanna provide some helpful tips for play that I've learned from experience that'll take your setups and actions as far as they can go.  <hr />  <h1>Handy Play Notes</h1> <ul>  	<li>90% of the time, your first order of business will be to Normal Summon either <span>Live☆Twin Ki-sikil</span> or <span>Live☆Twin Lil-la</span> from hand, then bring out the other from deck. That's when you either bring out a <span>Lil-la</span> <span>Treat</span> or <span>Backup Secretary</span> from hand, or Link the Ki-sikil into a <span>Link Disciple</span> while <span>Parallel eXceed</span> is in your hand ready to go to the empty zone Disciple is pointing to in order to be made into Devotee in the same zone. After the tokens from the two LINK-1's hit the field, it's time to make an <span>I:P Masquerena</span> in the zone Disciple's pointing to and then make an <span>Evil★Twin Lil-la</span>, or bring out the Lil-la first and then the Masquerena to the zone the blue demolition expert points to. Only after that can you use Evil Lil-la to revive Live Ki-sikil from GY, then use both it and Evil Lil-la to make <span>Evil★Twin Ki-sikil</span>. If you can afterwards, use her effect to revive either a Live Lil-la or Lil-la Treat from GY to use as either material for Masquerena to Link with during your opponent's turn, ammo for <span>Evil★Twin Present</span>, or the latter and then the former. THAT'S when you're open to use Evil Ki-sikil during your opponent's turn to revive Evil Lil-la from GY to get popping. It might be a lot to keep track of especially for a single bullet point, but practice makes perfect.</li>  	<li>As previously mentioned, <span>Live☆Twin Home</span> is really only used as your emergency button if you've been exhausted of ways to get Ki-sikil and Lil-la from the Main Deck to the field during your setups. So try and use Secret Password in that moment to aim for either of the mascots for the deck. Or, if that's not the issue, use Secret Password to instead look for <span>Evil★Twin Present <span>to allow that unconventional, non-destruction disruption to run amok.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>I:P Masquerena</span>, as previously stated, is your gateway to chainable disruption and interaction that would normally only be available during your turn. The Knightmare monsters she can bring out are proof of that, but so can Transcode Talker if your opponent wants to get trigger-happy with his targets on your monsters like Evil Ki-sikil and Lil-la. And since she's a Quick Effect, if your opponent tries to target or destroy any of your important material monsters during their turn, including Masquerena, that's the time to use her effect to go into a new Link and make them pay for their attempts to put you on ice.</li> </ul>  <hr />  And that's about it for these idols turned idol-snatchers. That's uh, two different kinds of idols if it wasn't clear enough. Anyways, it's a fun deck that's got a lot of room to grow, but in a positive way. Can't say for certain whether or not meta relevancy is in its future, but that's really not an issue for me or other similar strategies at all. So if you're looking to play something with an Extra Deck that's completely blue but are afraid of the lasting mental impact today's decks could have on you, look no further than a deck like this. And who knows? Maybe someday soon it'll get that future ante-up that Eldlich is getting in Blazing Vortex. Though maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part.  Sorry, am I rambling? Guess I've just been getting really caught up in how quickly I've learned to play and enjoy this cotton candy duo and their friends. And I hope the same for you, as well!"

Assumi","I will begin by saying this deck is not meta at all but is really fun to play with and the art work is incredible (not to mention that all the Rikka cards are Ultra / Super / Secret Rare).  First, the perfect hand. Hopefully your hand starts with one copy of Rikka petal at the best or at least one copy of lonefire as this allows you to start drawing the all important Rikka cards we need to be able to have a successful field. <ul>  	<li>If you draw Rikka Petal: Start by normal summoning this card and activating his effect to search to the hand Snowdrop (if you don't already have her in your hand).</li>  	<li>If you draw Lonefire Blossom: Normal summon lonefire blossom right away and active its effect to special summon Rikka Petal from your deck.</li> </ul> Once you have Snowdrop in your hand, activate her effect from your hand to tribute Rikka Petal and special summon both Snowdrop and a card of your choice from your hand. This is where it is highly dependant on what cards you have in your hand although at this stage (if nothing has been negated yet) you should be able to get an XYZ card out on the field.  Theres two ways you can end your first turn: <ul>  	<li>1) Either use snowdrops effect to get out any of the three Tytannial, Chirubime, or Talaya out to the field. If you have Chirubime is in your hand i would advise special summoning this card right away to allow better field protection. End your turn with snowdrop and one of those cards in defence position.</li>  	<li>2) Use snowdrops effect to special summon any other plant monster in your hand. Activate snowdrops second effect to make all monsters on your side of the field become the level of a monster on your field. I generally choose snowdrops level (8) so that i can special summon from the extra deck Alsei. Special summon Alsei in defence position and end your turn.</li> </ul> Turns after your first turn, you generally want to focus on getting Aromseraphy Jasime out and pointing towards Chirubime as that is a sort of stun for the appoint. Chirubime's effect means it is the only monster on your side of the field who can be targeted for an attack and pair that with Jasmines effect, it then cannot be destroyed by battle. At this point focus on getting Teardrop Rikka Queen XYZ summoned so you can activate her effect to remove from play an opponents field monster.  Assuming your opponent doesnt have any negation when they end their turn, you can rinse and repeat your first turn with rikka petal. Use rikka petals effect to special summon it to your field again and then repeat grab Snowdrop from your deck.  Spells and Traps:  AS soon as you can, use Mudan's effect to get Rikka Flurries activated. Each time you tribute (which will be a lot) , you can activate that effect to get your opponent to remove from play one of their monsters (at that choice). The other rikka cards are basically just ensuring you can get the cards you want into your hand or on the field. Use them as and when you deem necessary.  Finally, mirror force, i like running mirror force because the defence / attack of some of the Rikka cards cant compete against some decks like Salamangreat or Sky strikers for example.  Backup plan:  If your opponent seems to be dominating you, i have included in the extra deck Fairy Knight Ingunar, special summon this to clear the board and start over. Gives you a little time to get your cards together again to start special summoning.  Now, you are probably wondering why i never mention Synchro summoning. Well, its simple, you probably wont need too. The synchro monsters in the extra deck are only there if i desperately need them or i have nothing else to summon. The chances of this happening are low but if you do need to synchro summon save your ""effect veiler"" for that moment as its your only opportunity to synchro summon. At best, synchro summon Queen of thorns as you can easily lower your opponents life points with this card as your deck is only made out of plant monsters."
