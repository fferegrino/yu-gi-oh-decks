After this you can decide how continue the combo."

Anyway, Gren Maju is a fun OTK deck that doesn't require much effort or intelligence. Pretty simply, you banish tons of cards using Eater, Orochi, Shifter, etc to get a ton of fuel for Gren Maju to go to inane levels of strength and beat through anything and finish off the game fucking easy. I leaned into Dangers! a bit more heavily since I have lots of Danger! cards IRL and I plan on building this IRL, so.  Anyways, Dangers! help a ton with bodies on board and digging through the deck to get Maju, as nothing can search for Maju except for a random XYZ that I opted not to play. I also included a very s p i c y tech here- the Sangan engine. You may be wondering- What the fuck is a Sangan engine? What the fuck is this, GOAT Format? Yea, basically. The Sangan engine is basically where you normal summon Sangan, and send it off for Almiraj for an easy search with a large pool of monsters for combos, and a good monster on board. I included Santa Claws as the main target to out problem monsters, but you can also use it to search some of the Dangers! and handtraps, making Sangan a very generic card for the deck. I also included some generic cards in the extra, mainly generic links, Almiraj for the combo, and rank 8's and fusions to send for the Dogmatika match up. Overall, this is a fun and simple rouge deck that doesn't take much effort.

Dragoon</li>  	<li>Zerofyne: Dark ruler in a card +ATK boost &amp; still deal damage same-turn</li>  	<li>Doom Eagle: Tri-brigade friendly, clears out opponent graveyard sources, + OTK enabler</li>  	<li>Almiraj: Brick help - sends to grave Nervall, Kit, and (at worst) Bird of Beginning</li>  	<li>WHY? <strong><em>Warning Point instead of Imperm</em></strong>: Going against a deck like Dragon-Link where even if you have a great board they can break it 2nd turn and still go-off. Slows down their summoning &amp; attacks. You can side Imperms if you know you're going 2nd though. Up to you.</li> </ol> <span><strong>Possible Variations:</strong></span> <ol>  	<li>Like brigade better? Run less harpies but still keep some essentials: Perfumer, egotist, Harpie Lady (any variant), Harpist, Conductor, &amp; (of course) Feather Storm.</li>  	<li>Want more Simorgh? Swap out harpies for some birbs.</li>  	<li>Want more beasts? Sub-in Rescue cat, Kalantosa, &amp; Valerifawn.</li>  	<li>Finally, you can always also swap another Simorgh for the second Shuraig. I'm still trying both and neither is necessarily 'better'. Shuraig is beneficial when destroyed though, Simorgh is not.</li> </ol> <span><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span>  If you love Harpies but hate their death by hand-trap &amp; brick-city weaknesses, Harpie + Brigade is for you. You can easily search  &amp; run 3-of the best Trap (imo) of all time: Feather Storm. AND, you can use destruction &amp; banishing from opponents as an advantage!"

I think Phantom Knights are better in the current Meta game. Sure it wont win any matches, but it is very versatile. In my opinion Phantom Knights can hold on to Eldlichs resource game, to a certain degree, the matchup against Dino is evenly matched, but yeah Dragon Link is just unplayable most of the time. Against rogue decks it it is very good, you have a good otk you can pull up many disruptions on first turn and can wall up against heavy otk decks (most of the rogue decks just can set up a good otk) like Cyber Dragons.  As you can see I play two break swords and two cherubini, I do this for more recurtion and resource management. Also, you can see I don´t play Dragun, if you want to play the package it makes the deck better, but I believe Dragun should be banned it is a game breaking card and I do not want to support this card. I know its paradox to say something like this while playing Zeus, but you have to play some of these game breaking cards in order to compete and I think Dragun is even more toxic.  So obviously you can change so cards here, I like the deck how I build it, but I want to recommend so change, first obviously the dragun package, secondly ou can play farfa and take out the foolish and thirdly, you can play leviair for more consistency.  Please let me know if you like it or not and why, so we can develop our deck building skills."

In short it is a Blackwing deck about getting Synchro's out at a fast rate, it is kind of old school with ""Bora The Spear"", ""Sirocco The Dawn"" and cards like Gale and Fiendish Chain. But with modern additions like Assault Blackwing Kunai, Decay The Ill Wind.</span>  Main focus of the deck: fast Synchro Summons and Destruction  <strong>Important/useful Combos</strong>: Classics as Bora + Gale insta. Synchro LVL: 7 or an easy LVL: 8 Synchro via Decay + with most of the other Blackwings. Nearly every Blackwing that can Special summon itself for a very fast Synchro.                                                          ""Black Whirlwind"" the most powerful search card for Blackwings for when you can't Special on the 1st Turn or anytime else. Sirocco's effect for  a impressive ATK  boost for 1 other Blackwing, but locks you into attacking with the powerd up monster only.  <strong>Other Powerful tools</strong>: ""Icarus Attack"" a very useful card with the low cost of tributing 1 of your Monster for destroying up to 2 cards, and getting another Blackwing out is easy thus making the cost almost 0. ""Sirocco"" + ""Bora"" + other ""Blackwing"" on the field with ""Kalut The Moon Shadow""' effect from your hand for a possible OTK or at least severe damage. ""Allure Of Darkness"" lets you draw 2 cards by banishing 1 Dark Attribute monster from your hand, that makes it 100% better then ""Cards for Black Feathers"" which prohibits you from Special Summoning for that turn.  <strong>Last but not least Synchros</strong>: this deck consists of a wide range of Synchro monsters which includes, Classics as ""Blackwing Armor Master"" and ""Stardust Dragon"" also powerful cards like ""Blackwing Raikiri The Rain Shower"" with it you can destroy up to 4 cards per turn if you got a full set of 5 Blackwings on the field, which is quite easy to achieve. Other notable cards are, ""Red Dragon Archfiend"" for blowing up the opponents defending monsters or ""Blackwing Full Armor Master"" for dealing with effect monsters.  thats it I hope this deck is of any use for this is my first deck I will upload on here, it will  definitely not be my last one! feel free to rate this deck or you may explain to me and everyone else things that could be changed or what I missed.

(note: I'm avoiding some cards like Raptor because I plan on playing this IRL, but I might update this w/ Raptor once it comes out.) Anyway, this deck is focused around Machina combos using Scraps. The main idea is to shit out monsters to the board using Machina SS conditions, along with normal summoning Recycler to send Rosenix. Rosenix gets a free token for plays as well, which i sgreat. After that the deck can go into some big links and R A N K 1 0 T R A I N S. Generally a pretty fun and dumb deck."

Come and meet him.,"<span>The idea of this deck is to make semi-infinite summons in order to fill the field with the synchro Shien and, with support for negation (Number 106) and to increase the attack of the warriors (Ferocious Flame Swordsman). So having an excellent field in the first round to block your opponent's moves. Playing in the second round can guarantee an OTK, but you are more likely to be blocked by your opponent, which can end up breaking the combo.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Use Shogun to search for the ""Gateway of the Six"" or another card that can place ""Bushido Counters"" to facilitate the combo. The counters will help you to search and summon the ""Kizan"" or the ""Grandmaster"" to recover the spent counters and continue the combo.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Use Isolde to summon a ""Fuhma"" straight from the deck to the field so that you can do another Shien synchro. If you are lucky with your hand, it is possible to make three Shiens. Since the normal thing about this combo is that you leave two in the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The other monsters (Number 106 and F. Flame Swordsman) you can normally summon by following the combo. The first using two ""Kizans"" and the second using one ""Kizan"" and one ""Grandmaster"".</span>  <span>Tip: Never summon monsters that you will not remove from the field in the link zone that Shogun points to. Well, Shogun assists you by adding counters when you call the ""Six Samurai"" in your link zone. Only at the end, when you are finishing the combo with ""Number 106"" and ""F. Flame Swordsman"", is it free to summon. Because at this point, you will already have your monster zone full.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>That's it guys, I hope you enjoy the deck. Patience to hit the combo and be careful not to get excited about the combo too.</span> <span>See you on the next deck.</span>  &nbsp;"

The main problem was a lack of interaction; too many floodgates meant that I was just sitting there and waiting to get Twin Twistered'. This is a new build which has more traps for interaction, like Lost Wind, and I included Trap Trick to dig them out more consistently without having to rely on the opening hand luck as much. I included general stun cards like Inspector Boarder and TCBOO, and Cyber-Stein is there to turbo out Dragoon for negates or an Invoked."

That takes a minimum of just 6 monsters and I:P can link itself Verte and the summon from Spheres, for either of our Link 5's.  If u want to play LV10 Turbo, just cut the Dark Dragoon stuff, for 2 more LV7 and LV10. Maybe also 1 LV5 to send off Pile and search LV7. Basically just get Saryuja to summon LV7 for you and skip the LV ups lol.  I find this version more fun, jamming as many extenders and link 2 bosses as I can. Have fun!! =]  &nbsp;  In lieu of a strict combo guide, I offer this checklist of things to do on any turn:  BLACK METAL / SEYFERT - This is the best starter, especially because you can, uhh, start searching your Red-eyes fusion stuff if you loop Black Metal then shuffle them back with Saryuja for extra advantage LOL. the line goes Black Metal &gt; Striker Dragon &gt; REDMD &gt; Black Metal &gt; Romulus. Seyfert does the same thing, but doesnt get us the extra plus.  ROMULUS - This card gets Ravine which sends Absorouter, which gets Tracer. If you draw either Ravine or Absorouter, just skip Romulus or use Ravine to discard Absorouter. Next you can summon Tracer using Boot Sector Launch.  SARYUJA - So, to make Saryuja here we actually need 1 extender after the Romulus play. We can keep playing without one, by using Tracer to pop Boot Sector, but that locks us into Darks, Saryuja and Spheres are both Light. If you have an extender, summon Elpy next to Striker then use Elpy to get a 4th monster.  ELPY - My favorite Elpy target is Seyfert, which is why I only play the 1, but Tempest, Pile Armed, and Black/Darkness Metal all do the same basic thing. To avoid getting locked into dragons, link off Elpy into Saryuja, then after using Pisty late in the combo (ideally for Tracer or just Rokket Synchron if you already used it) link that off for Spheres. If you make Spheres first, you have to use both Guardragons before Saryuja, to link them off, or go into Borrelend early.  PILE ARMED - Pile Armed Dragon either searches Armed Dragon Flash, or draws 1, its nuts. It makes a great starter or extender at any time, as long as you have the send for it. Any Armed Dragon, Tempest or Absorouter are the best discards. Otherwise, Saryuja is the best way to summon it, letting you get the plus without discarding.  TEMPEST - This along with Pile Armed are the best ways for us to get to our Synchros. This is one of the last monsters you re-summon at the end of you combos when you need that one last non-link for I:P or Verte. Tempest is also the alternate send off Ravine if you draw Absorouter.  CHAOS RULER - If you know you have the Light and Dark to resummon it (pretty much if you got to Seyfert) you should always go for this card. You can make it with Tracer+a chaos dragon, or Synchron+Pile Armed/Tempest. The excavate greatly helps to find Tempest and the add will usually hit Veiler, or a Rokket, but can hit Noctovision at best! The resummon is what makes it really strong, and if you pull it off should let you end on Hot Red D and Dark Dragoon with ease.  Once you do all of that, it's time to link away or synchro whatever is left, ideally ending on Heiratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres, I:P Masquerena, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, and Hot Red Dr. Abyss. With this, I:P can link itself, Verte, the monster Spheres will summon, and one opponent's monster for Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, or for Borrelend Dragon.  &nbsp;"

People are hating on KONAMI for hitting drytrons so hard but there was a reason they did it!! Diviner of the Heralds is officially announced to be TCG and it is coming via LIOV with the Fafnir XYZ monster!!! This changes everything for drytrons and will (trust me) make them meta again. Just opening alpha + zeta (or literally anything that gives you access to them like fafnir, nova and emergency) can give you 4 ultimateness negates and a unicorn during the opponent's turn and EVEN if your board were to get dark ruler’ed (not a word), you will still have 2 orange light negates in hand as backup! I think KONAMI limited benten for a reason and this is definitely it!

You should really read the further description by clicking th","Hi! I made a new deck.  You may look at this decklist, and perhaps scoff (lol), or at least think this deck is sub-par, but, I believe I can show you how this can be an incredible and powerful deck.  Or it may be crap, in which case, screw me.  If you don't know me <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/best-of-blue-eyes-re-make/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/best-of-blue-eyes-re-make/</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/amazing-ancient-gears/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/amazing-ancient-gears/</a> are some of the better decks I've made. Please, check them out (or do not, I am not a beggar)  As for this deck, let's get into it for real.  Your end goal is to cause Armageddon or just the plain old end, with any of your chaos emperor dragon's. Now, I don't like archetypes, I'm not sure why, so there are plenty cards in here that are just here, some people don't like that, but I hope some of you can appreciate that. It's not just a decklist copied and pasted from the internet, and it's not using the same 4 words or same 2 monsters. Two other monsters you can use to take out you opponents, are Ma'at, and Mythical beast master Cerberus. Now, this deck was gone for sort of an Egyptian theme (vaguely mind you), I picked out some more Egyptian themed powerful monster's, without going Egyptian god or Exodia, or even the creator route. Ma'at is summoned using a light dragon, and a light fairy, for the dragon part of that, we have Radiant Vouirescensce (perhaps spelled incorrectly) which will also come in use for other monsters. For the fairy we have out Parshaths, not counting the dark counterpart, and Honest, again, dismissing the dark version. Honest can be moved back and forth between the hand, and onto the field once per turn, so you can have it attack you opponent if given the chance, then in your main phase two, bring it back to your hand if you have a stronger monster on the field as well, and you don't want honest to be vulnerable. On top of that, a monster of the Light attribute, can absorb it's enemies attack, using honest's effect while in the hand, and this is all the same for dark honest as well. Both honest and dark honest work well with the strongest members of this deck, the chaotic kings, Ma'at, and even the mythical beasts, powering them up, and being the right attributes to help summon at least some, if not most of them. Airknight and Darknight parshath as well, although to a slightly smaller extent, and they get better with neo parshath. While were almost on the topic of mythical beasts, let's jump all the way there, because some people might be confused as to their addition to this deck. Why are they here? Because their cool, powerful, easy to summon, and one of them is a jackal, an animal famous for being an Egyptian creature. Getting Mythical beast master Cerberus should be simple, just, like, draw it, and add it to your pendulum zone, when hopefully your Chaos dragon isn't there. Next up, with it's effect, send it to the extra deck, and bring forth your King Jackal, which can use it's effect, and we'll get to see our old friend Master Cerberus once again, this time on the field, able to destroy your enemies, which is boosted by the many spell cards within the deck, including Power of the guardians. Some spells include Gold sarcophagus, good if you need a specific card, which you often will, Twin twisters, to get rid of those pesky trap/spells your opponent has, raigeki, old school, but watch your opponents monsters be a annihilated, and card advance, since it's nice to know what's coming up ahead, and it works wonders for Ma'at's ability, so you don't just have to guess. I would recommend old summoning Ma'at if you have or used card advance and know what's coming up. Finally, chaos time. Radiant Vouirescensce can be summoned, sending more of it to the grave, one of which can become dark, and boom, immediate way to summon our chaos emperors. Chaos creator and Valkery also help, being of the same archetype. With envoy, or any really of your chaos dragons, destroy everything on the field and in the hand, just obliterate your opponent, and then strike. Simple. Chaotic. Real quick, let me acknowledge the triple sticks, Gather your mind, and Hyena. Both of them are for deck shortening, and yes, when it comes to it, stalling. Lot's of specific cards are needed in this deck, so using gather your mind and hyena can make the amount of cards you need to look through minimal. Also, both have vaguely Egyptian themes.  I believe that's it, it's better to play it, test this deck on Duel Nexus, or at home with your own cards, at a card store (stay safe though), test it, edit it, leave suggestions in the comments, tell me what I did wrong, what I did right, what you think of the deck, and feel free to check out my others as well. Thank you very much for reading if you've come this far, and have a good day."

Plunge your opponent into an endless spiral of pain! OwO Los dragones han creado su arma definitiva. ,"Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Invocar a Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons y Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon para crear un loop de burn infinito! OwO  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong>  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  https://youtu.be/_1ARtuZ6qDU  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Al final se necesitará varios dragones, pero éstos son fáciles de spamear en la baraja. Siempre la idea es ir por Romulus y los Guardragon para acceder a sus efectos de spam y traer a Black Metal Dragon para obtener a los Red-Eyes.  <strong>Extenders para iniciar el combo</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Absorouter Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si controlamos un Rokket, lo cual es sencillo. Aún así, siempre se puede enviar al cementerio para añadirnos un Rokket a la mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Noctovision Dragon: </strong>Se invoca solo si invocamos otro dragón de modo especial. Además, cuando se va del campo, nos da un robo!</li>  	<li><strong>Black Dragon Collapserpent: </strong>Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de luz, además nos trae a Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>White Dragon Wyverburster:</strong> Se invoca gratis removiendo un monstruo de oscuridad, además nos trae a Collapserpent.</li>  	<li><strong>Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm:</strong> Se invoca gratis del cementerio, por lo que es el target preferido de Foolish Burial y Dragon Shrine.</li>  	<li><strong>Starliege Dragon Seyfert: </strong>Una invocación normal excelente, ya que con su efecto tendremos en mano a Collapserpent o Wyverburster.</li>  	<li><strong>Rokket Tracer: </strong>Normal Summon de último recurso, además de tener excelentes interacciones con Section Boot y Absorouter. Y es tuner!</li>  	<li><strong>Black Metal Dragon: </strong>Se usa de Normal Summon. Nos añade un Red Eyes, lo cual nos permite usar el Rokket Tracer como extender.</li>  	<li><strong>One For One: </strong>Nos trae a Black Metal Dragon.</li>  	<li><strong>Dragon Shrine y Foolish Burial: </strong>Ver Darkwurm.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>Nos da un cuerpo adicional.</li>  	<li><strong>Chaos Space: </strong>Efecto similar a Seyfert, pero sin gastar la Normal Summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Quick Revolve: </strong>Nos trae a Rokket Tracer gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>Guardragon of the World Legacy: </strong>Efecto similar a Monster Reborn, pero además nos permite mover a un dragón (por lo general un Guardragon).</li>  	<li><strong>Borrel Regenerator: </strong>Nos permite reciclar a Rokket Tracer, por lo que se le puede usar antes como extender.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene un burn infinito, por lo que no importa cuántos LP tenga el oponente, igual perderá.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene tan sólo 1 garnet (Red Eyes Fusion), que incluso es posible devolver con Unicorn.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene extenders muy poderosos, por lo que es posible que sobren recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende de varias adiciones específicas a la mano. Si nos niegan alguna, será gg.</li>  	<li>Por la naturaleza del deck, éste no tiene acceso a protección.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck consume varios extenders, por lo que es necesaria una buena mano para realizar los combos.</li> </ul>"

The Field Spell negates the effects of monsters on either side of the field if they don't have the same ATK &amp; DEF, as long as you have Special Summoned 10 Machine monsters with the same ATK &amp; DEF. I found that Deskbots are extremely good at swarming the field so you can easily get 10 Special Summons, and (thankfully) all have the same 500/500 ATK &amp; DEF. This is a way I found to get to the win condition but is in no way the best way, so if you have any other way to get the 10 counters, please share the combo line so that this deck can be fine-tuned.  The best combo line I found is Deskbot 003 summon 001 go into Halq, Halq summon 001, go into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens then summon both copies of 001 from GY and turn 1 001 and all tokens into Deskbot Jet. Jet pop a Deskbot monster to Special Summon 1 from Deck and from there try to get the last 1-2 counters you dont have by whatever you have in yout hand or field. This all has to be done while having the Gizmek Field Spell face-up ON YOUR FIELD."

The strategy is to use negate effects to deter your opponent from playing their game... sort of like control. The main card of this deck is <img src=""file:///C:/Users/ryker/Downloads/red_eyes_dark_dragoon_by_kraus_illustration_de9ldiq-fullview.jpg"" alt=""Red Eyes Dark Dragoon"" />, you would want to get him on the field as soon as you can. His effect must be used wisely since it is once per turn. The spells in this deck allow you to draw and that is a side purpose. Mystic mine and field barrier protect you from attacks since the current meta that focuses on swarming. The Nobleman helps banish traps and spells and banishes all traps named like it. Judgment of Anubis helps protect your spells and traps, and so does Ultimate Providence; The card is beastly since its a speed 3 and a counter. The side deck is self explanatory, hand traps and backboard destroyer. The Solemns' are for further negation and destruction. Card destruction and Pot of Benevolence are there to aid and are semi necessary if you'd like. The extra deck has Number 39: Utopia to negate attacks. Bujinki and the rest of the knightmares are fillers but one of each are still good if you plan to use their effects. Link Kuriboh helps and Dark Dragoon. I am constantly changing this deck to play better. My main goal is to attack the current meta and people's playstyle. Honestly, I am fed up with decks that rely on combos. Its become a little annoying to see people memorizing combos instead of building their own deck and succeeding that way. Call this deck what you want, but It has some thought put into it. Sadly, this deck will not appear in the Meta-Boards."
