Time for Salamangreat to turn up the heat!","Now that Miragestallio is back, Salad builds have started to run <a data-name=""Backup Secretary"">Backup Secretary</a> and <a data-name=""Sea Archiver"">Sea Archiver</a> again. While this does make it easier to access Miragestallio, I think that it's not necessary, as you already have plenty of level 3s in the deck (Foxy, Spinny, Gazelle, <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> even) that you'll either draw or add to hand during your combos. You also only have 1 rank 3 that you'll want to go into in this strategy, that being Miragestallio. Instead, I continued to include <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed (from earlier builds)</a> for easy access to rank 4s (which are less accessible to this deck.)  Extra deck ratios are pretty standard, just sided the usual Bagooska for Miragestallio. Also, I know I'm not running that many hand traps, but I built the deck to be more focused around playing through hand traps than using them, but I still included the best ones.  Anyways, feel free to leave suggestions in the comments about how to improve on this deck, and also tell me what deck I should make next."

Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!  <strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>  	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>  	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>  	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>  	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>  	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>  	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>  	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li> </ul> <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>El deck usa burn infinito, por lo que no importa los LP que tenga, igual perderá.</li>  	<li>Hay tres Isolde, por lo que si uno falla, aún quedan más.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck requiere pagar bastantes LP, lo cual no siempre será posible si no lo efectuamos el primer turno.</li>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene varios Garnets.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>A pesar de tener burn infinito, sigue perdiendo ante Ghost Sister.</li> </ul>"

A very consistent one.  Reasons therefor is mainly their field spell. Any link 3 or above Marincess monster combined with the field spell is good. The big problem is that those protection effects are only applied while the field spell stays on the field.  Beyond the boss monster you are able to put up there is nothing to interact with the other player. No negates or whatsoever (Except for Marincess wave). My wish would be to get another Monster that is able to interact more...  So we desperately need some way to keep our field spell on the board. Either by protecting it (Field barrier) or by interrupting the opponent. Normally the way to do this would be by putting up some negates.  &nbsp;  We need to know just little things about this deck: <ol>  	<li>Your hand is dead if you have no Marincess monster card hence why we are playing some of the trash cards (and more than one mandarine).</li>  	<li>How many Marincess monsters you need to summon one link 4 marincess monster with searching the field spell and the summoned monster needs crystal heart as material.</li>  	<li>How can I utilize the other cards to put up more protection.</li>  	<li>The magical number is level 8. (Synchro summon).</li>  	<li>The field spell only protects from the opponents effects (torrential).</li>  	<li>You have a lot of built in protections (field spell, Basilalima, Marbled rock, Wonder Heart, dont sleep on Fury of Kairyu-Shin).</li> </ol> A few combos you need to know: <ol>  	<li>Blue Tang or Sea Horse = field spell + link 4: NS Sea Horse --&gt; Link 1 Blue slug, effect add back Sea Horse --&gt; SS Sea Horse --&gt; Link 1 Sea angel, effect add field spell --&gt; link 2 splash mage, effect special sea horse --&gt; link 2 Coral anenome, effect reborn splash mage, activate field spell --&gt; link4</li>  	<li>Blue Tang +  Pascalus + any extender = field spell + link 4 + toadally awesome (Careful with zone placement): NS Pascalus, effect, SS Blue Tang, pitch Sea horse --&gt; link 1 (Blue tang) Blue Slug, effect Sea horse to hand, effect draw Blue tang (<strong>CHAINBLOCK</strong>) --&gt; SS Sea horse --&gt; link 1 Sea angel, effect search field spell --&gt; link 2 Coral anenome (both link 1s), effect reborn blue tang --&gt; XYZ Bahamut, effect SS toad --&gt; activate field spell, link 4, effect field spell</li>  	<li><strong>PERFECT COMBO: </strong>Pascalus + Blue Tang + (1. Instant Fusion + 2 ways for level 3 (Sea horse, Sea archiver, monster reborn, world legacy suc)/(2. Scrypton + Arboria + extender)/(3. <em>Always have in mind that WHITE Stingray reborn can be a tuner</em>) = field spell + link 4 + toad + Dragite: basically the same as the 2. combo but in case of 1. make sure to summon the Sea archiver when possible or just reborn + Theseus (Instant Fusion) for Dragite; 2. Arboria can be summoned at the end in a zone and scrypton should be easy too; 3. white stingray can be a tuner and therefor is + another level 4 after being reborn (Coral anenome is always a 100% reborn) is Dragite too. Extenders for that are Shthana, Silent Angler, Aqua Spirit, another Stingray, etc.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Thinks i tried but really disliked were handtraps. They were always the keyfactor to bricking.

Can beat some fairly competitive decks like Salamangreat.,"Deck Profile, How to, Combos, and Duel Replay:  https://youtu.be/Jd7Gb91iWMY  You should focus on using Different Dimension Capsule to banish Obelisk The Tormentor so you can add it to your hand two turns from activation. During the 1st turn after that, you should focus on using the Photon Sabre Tiger or Nimble engine to get monsters on your field and protect yourself. The Nimble engine will keep your opponent busy. The second turn after you should use the Condemned Witch engine to grab a Forbidden Chalice from your deck, and then during your opponents turn activate its effect to summon Ra's Desciple, which will activate and allow you to summon two more Ra's Desciple. On your third turn if you didn't get board wiped you should have enough monsters to tribute summon for Obelisk.  Tribute summon for Obelisk earlier if you also can get Exchange Souls in hand.  Use Supply Squad to draw through your deck and the other cards to protect you and control the board. When you have used up your Nimble or condemned witch's, use Pot of Avarice to recycle them back into the deck and draw two.  Try to also time your Obelisk Summon so you can use Fist of Fate to board wipe your opponent's backrow.  Also have a blast!"

This time I will discuss about other cards, additional cards, and replacement cards that you can use on the Worm deck. You can replace some cards, add cards, and even remake the Worm deck that I created in the first part of this article.  You can replace all the cards in the Worm deck using all the cards that I will discuss, except the Evil Dragon Ananta card. This is because, Evil Dragon Ananta is a mainstay monster card that is in synergy with the Worm monster card.  In addition, if you don't use Evil Dragon Ananta, the Worm deck is not strong enough to face other decks in the YuGiOh Duel Links game.  Regarding the character's ability, you can actually replace it with all the existing character's abilities or you think are suitable. Alternative character abilities that I recommend when using the Worm deck are Yami Yugi's Destiny Draw or Joey Wheeler's Last Gamble.  To find out what other cards, additional cards, and replacement cards you can use on the Worm deck, see the cards and their explanations below.  A monster card that has the following effect: if flipped, you can destroy an enemy's Spell/Trap card in the field. This card is suitable for destroying/controlling the enemy's back row.  If you have trouble destroying the enemy's back row before you can special summon Devil Dragon Ananta, then you can use this card first.  You can get this card through the Generation Next pack gatcha.

The purpose of using this monster card is to use it as a beater, because it has a fairly high ATK, namely: 1850. One of the Reptile-type monsters that has a fairly high ATK.  You can get this card through the Echoes of Silence pack gatcha.  Reptile type monster card which has the following effect: if it is flipped, you can return one monster card in the field.  A Reptile-type monster card that has very useful effects on you! If you have difficulty dealing with a monster card that has a high enough ATK, then you can return the monster card to the enemy's hand using this card effect.  You can get this card through the Chaotic Compliance pack gatcha."

Regardless the presence of Halqlifibrax, Selene, Diviner, and especially Masquerena still means this isn't a budget deck. I decided to make this a seperate decklist as the intention will be to eventually buy the missing cards and use the original deck, or playtest the changed cards to see which ones work better. As such this is a stop gap.  The primary gameplan hasn't changed, this is a control deck with a small emphasis on getting out I:P Masquerena, Absolute Dragon and a 3rd monster to summon Avramax and Vortex during the opponent's turn, While using any remaining cards in the hand to fortify the board. One possible combo is detailed my my original deck post.  As for the changes, The Solemn traps are replaced by one <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, and two each of <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> and <a data-name=""Heavy Storm Duster"">Heavy Storm Duster</a>. This is mainly for another card to get Cutia out and backrow hate, respectably. For the Extra, <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> replaces Abyss Dweller as I don't have a 3rd copy of the latter yet. For the side deck I went with 1 <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, 2 of <a data-name=""Denko Sekka"">Denko Sekka</a>, and 3 of <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>. this is in place of the Ash and Nibiru. With Veiler as a lateral move form Ash and Sekka and Twisters being more backrow hate for the recently empowered Sky Striker matchup, as well as Pendulum deck (such as the mirror) and trap-heavy decks like Eldlitch (since Sekka blocks Traps)  &nbsp;  Minor updates would warrant changing this list, directly, while more substantial updates (being it adjusting for the banlist or changing out 7 or more cards in total) would parent a new iteration which would be labeled 0.2 or 1.0 depending on how tournament ready (Locals mainly) I think this list is.  <hr />  EDIT:  -2 Denko Sekka, -2 Anti-Spell Fragerance  +1 <a data-name=""Trias Hierarchia"">Trias Hierarchia</a>, +1 <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>. +2 <a data-name=""Archfiend Eccentrick"">Archfiend Eccentrick</a>"

Generic beast support while trying to annoy your opponent as much as possible but with cute cards. ,This deck relies on special summoning as much as you can. Ideally you want to see rescue cat and obedience schooled in your opening hand so you can bring out naturia beast and Melffy of the forest turn on going first to deny your opponent plays and then set up a board of beefy extra deck monsters to attack with. It’s very reliant on seeing specific cards as early as possible which is why it’s a super casual deck but I still tried to make it work.

Just use Fraktall to send Nervall and then search and in the 1st turn u most likely want to search Kit and NS her.  So now to the unusal cards in this deck.  Main Deck:  Danger Thunderbrid/ Jackalope  Thunderbird is the Wingedbeast extender that u somtimes need and Jackalope can SS him from the deck and also u can pop a set card with it if u play u`r hand out first.  Jackalope can be searched with Shuraig and is also a target 4 Rescue Cat waht somtimes will come in handy.  Reborn Tengu:  Can SS a other Kopie from the Deck (<u>not</u> once per turn) can get u to high Link`s very esay and fuels the GY.  Can be searched with Tenki and SS from the deck with Airborne.  And i know u can draw 2 ore 3 Kopies of it but keep in mind this is a 50 card deck so it won`t happend that much.  Simorgh of the Beginning:  If u really need a Wingedbeast or lvl 1 on the Field u can send him from the deck to the GY an SS him but keep in mind that he locks u under Wingedbeast.  He also can protect Simorgh bird of sovereignty because of the eff of Simorgh bird of sovereignty.  Can also be SS with the eff of Simorgh of the Kings.  Watch Cat:  Is importent 4 Ariborne because of the low ATK of Lyrilusc mons and Nervall so u always have a traget in the deck to SS.  Is a traget 4 Rescue Cat  A free lvl 1 extender.  U leave it on the field if u dont need it to bann it in the EP and search Tenki 4 the next turn.  Extra Deck:  2x Shuraig 2x Ferrijit 2x Simorgh bird of sovereignty:  Because u`r board can be broken and this deck is not a Glasscannon. Playing 2 of each of them will help u build up u`r board agian and gain the control of the field back.  Cross Sheep:  Is the Link that u just  want to summon if u just need a link 2 and if u summoned Gamma and Driver in ur turn because u dont have a other easy way to use them but if u want to do that keep in mind to do that before u use the Linksummon eff from one off ur Tri-Brigade mons.  Side Deck:  Archnemeses Eschatos:  U only want to side him in Game 2 or 3 when u know that u`r going 2nd or u`r going first and u`r opponent is playing a dragon deck because the eff only works with types that are on the field. But it is very powerful it can nuke u`r opponents board and lock him so he can`t summon.  Spiritualism:  The beast way to out Spells and Traps that are strong agianst this deck like Zombieworld or Mine it don`t taget, don`t destroys and can`t be negated.  There is no way that u`r opponent can protect his spells/traps from this card, it will gives u 1 turn and this is all waht u need.  The rest of the deck is common stuff. If u want to test out this deck u need to know it is not 4 starter it can take some time to get used to it u will make many missplays and most important have Fun with this Deck.  I would love if u leave me a Komment if u Like this deck and waht do u think waht could i do to make it better."

However, it can still become a reality. About a month ago, the collection ""Mass Effect: Legendary Edition"" landed, which are nicer versions of the beloved science fiction trilogy. <a>https://oss1173filmguide.wildapricot.org/</a> In an interview with the site Business Insider, project manager Mac Walters says that several film adaptations of the games have been underway, but have failed. <a>https://conjuring3deutschguide.wildapricot.org/</a> Also read: 5 games that should be a movie or TV series  As early as 2010, a ""Mass Effect"" film was announced by Legendary Pictures, which never materialized. Walters says that one of the difficulties was to compress the expansive and story-heavy universe in a film. <a>https://thesuicidesquaddeutschguide.wildapricot.org/</a>  - It felt like we were always fighting headwinds with the franchise. What story do you tell in 90-120 minutes?  Instead of a film, the project was transformed into a TV series, which also did not lift from idea to reality.  Mac Walters says, however, that this does not mean that it will never get rid of, but rather that it is a matter of time before it becomes a film or TV series of ""Mass Effect"".  - It's more about when, than about. It is such a vast world and so many in the TV and film industry have asked us if we want to do it and said that we really should do it, he says. <a>https://spacejam2deutschguide.wildapricot.org/</a>  The first ""Mass Effect"" was released in 2007 and is about the human soldier Shepherd, who together with an ensemble of interesting types goes into space to defeat the synthetic Reaper creatures who want to kill all biological life in the universe. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://twitter.com/FilmKaamelott"">Kaamelott : Premier volet </a>"

Tour Guide From The Underworld is a natural inclusion to the deck, as well as the little Speedroid engine.  The rest of the cards is just genric goodstuff that fills up the empty space.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

Combos can be the same as without the Megalith package and it's not necessary to use them, but they can be used to help recycle ritual monsters and provide tribute fodder for following turn. Whilst not always needed, with Vanity's Ruler you can setup a board that can play around Super Poly against Invoked Dogmatika Shaddolls. A good hand of Alpha, Zeta or Cyber Emergency and Nova, plus Megalith Phul, Meteonis Drytron and either Herald of Ultimateness or Vanity, you can set up Beatrice, Ultimateness and Vanity's Ruler all on your first turn. Due to combos/boards like this a second copy of the ritual spell is needed."

It got its own structure deck but it started earlier than that, it first debuted with the monster geargiano who was in Generation Force, the was the only card of the archetype at the time and didn’t have specific name listing so it wasn’t an archetype quite yet. Later it got actual support in Rise of the Duelist. Later they would go to get their own structure deck, and, despite never taking off too far, got their own little following. But they’re also known to be pretty bad, sure they got monster spam but they also are pretty underwhelming these days, but here we are! Earth machines to save the day! With all of the new earth machine cards making machina one of the better decks in the game I decided to use that for geargia, I took an ancient gear spin to make the deck have a little more brute force and trains for an OTK swing, I could’ve added more but I felt that then it wouldn’t be a Geargia deck anymore."

Then, if you activate Vampire's Domain and then summon Vampire Red Baron, activate Domain to normal summon Scourge and then use his ability to bring Baron back? That gives you your ace monster, Vampire Sheridan and there's a few fun things that can do from there depending on the stage that the duel is at.  The Retainer and Familiar play on sending your own Vampire cards to the graveyard so Voivode is one of the first ones you'll want to try to send there if you can because when you use Bram's effect to special summon monsters from your opponent's grave, it's easy to get Voivode out on the field. Then, if you use Bram and Vampire Sucker's effects on the same turn, you can just sacrifice 2 of your opponents special summoned monsters to get Voivode out on the field so you don't have to sacrifice your own monsters.  Just a deck for casual play but I have fun with it"

Feel free to leave suggestions on how I can improve the deck.,"Hello everyone, its very nice to see you guys again and I hope you guys are keeping safe during these times. So just recently I've attended my first yugioh locals and it was a pretty fun and interesting experience for myself even though I didn't expect to perform well I still got the chance to learn from my mistakes whilst trying to improve &amp; tweak the deck a little bit.  So far I've made a few adjustments to the deck such as adding Jack-o-bolan for more GY extenders as well as a copy of Drowning Mirror force to the deck. At the moment I am planning on making the deck competitive being that its the only deck that I am playing at this point and personally I don't see myself playing different deck such as the Mayakashi. However my best friend Zoroark_Gaming was luckily enough to pull 1 copy of Eldlich the Golden Lord from Maximum Gold recently and from there I thought to myself that maybe there is a chance I can make this deck more competitive once I've figured out a well balanced ratio for the deck as well as I am thinking of replacing a copy of Oboro-Guruma, the Wheeled Mayakashi for a copy of Draconecro Nethersoul Dragon in future builds of the deck.  &nbsp;  I would love to hear your guys thoughts and suggestions on how I can improve my Mayakashi deck as well as what cards should be taken out and replaced with and also what ratio of cards that I could play to make the deck more balanced."

The main combo is to get light+past on the field, to banish light with past to get Water from the deck and draw 2. From there on, you need to synchro and then de-synchro with your fortune ladies to keep spamming Fortune Lady Water's draw 2 effect, until you find a card that'll let you summon a second FL Water.  Once you have 2 FL Waters in rotation, you can start making Lv9 Synchros like Ravenous Crocosaur and Trishula, and then draw 4 every time you de-synchro.  For an example, check near the end of the video (timestamps are in the description)."

Welcome.  ENGAGE is back, expanding the Sky Striker's toolset. <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a> is a spell for Sky Strikers that searches any card besides itself, and lets you draw 1 if you have 3 spells or more in your GY. Crazy, isn't it? For first time Sky Striker players, this deck may prove to be challenging, but fear not, because I will help you along the way!  Let's engage!  I have been playing Sky Strikers since its release in 2019, and I have to say it is one of the most fun and rewarding decks to play if done right. It certainly plays out a lot of cards at once, so newcomers to YuGiOh may not know what to do with all of the combos. Here are some examples:  <strong>Sky Strikers go first: </strong>  For this starting hand we have: Multirole, Area Zero/Terraforming, Roze, and There Can Be Only One <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole"">Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole &gt; <em>Destroys</em> </a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero"">Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole""> &gt; <em>SS</em> </a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye"">Sky Striker Ace - Raye &gt;</a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Raye""> <em>Link</em> </a><a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a> &gt; Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero <em>to hand &gt; </em><em>Play </em>Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero</li>  	<li><em>Play </em><a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a></li>  	<li><em>SS</em> <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Roze"">Sky Striker Ace - Roze</a></li> </ul> OR <ul>  	<li>Sky Striker Ace - Raye &gt; <em>Link</em> <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku"">Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku</a> &gt; <em>End And Search </em>Sky Striker (Any Spell)</li> </ul> So, even though it's not shown, there are many different variations of just 1 turn with 5 cards. Sky Strikers can be extremely powerful in 1:1 exchanges and can be further empowered by Kaiju support.  I believe that running 2 of any Kaiju (I prefer Gameciel and Gardala) could work as a helpful support. Running 3 is okay, so long as you have the space for it.  I also run a <a data-name=""Kyoutou Waterfront"">Kyoutou Waterfront</a> here because the effects that come with Kaiju cards could greatly benefit Sky Striker gameplay. Especially Gameciel's.  Why do I run <a data-name=""Summon Limit"">Summon Limit</a>? Because it's simply a good stall tool, but obviously you don't need to run it always. Try Mystic Mine if you don't like people getting advantages.  <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One "">There Can Be Only One</a> simply just helps against a variety of different types of decks. You might want to switch out against decks like Dragon Link and Dinosaur, though.  <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> gives you a good +1 for extra resources. Sure, it may give them 1000 LP, but no one really cares when you have their board wiped out.  <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a> is a good counter to Ghost Girls.  ROTA helps get out Raye or Roze.  Cosmic Cyclone because some spells can be pesky.  Forbidden Droplet because of its power and utility in the current meta.  Accesscode for smashing other people's monsters.  There are many decks for Sky Strikers, but it's up to you to find a deck that works for you. I hope this helps. Thank you!  See you next time!"
