Goals are to quickly have <strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> in Graveyard or Hand. Do not be afraid to use&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong>&nbsp;on weaker monsters. Just get as many monsters on the field and aim for an OTK.</p><p>There are no negations like <strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></strong> because sometimes I myself find myself needing an opponent's monster to do the OTK;&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> will not trigger since one needs to declare battle with a monster so that it can be special summoned. Hence, I decided to let the opponent run wild with their summons. Abuse of an attack positioned monster is needed.</p><p><strong><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> targets are usually <strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> itself to allow recyclability. One may recycle <strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong> by using it as XYZ material. This way it will avoid itself from being banished even after using its special summon effect.</p><p>Do not use <strong><a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>&nbsp;</strong>on Turn 2 or later. It's only usable on Turn 1. It can be replaced with something else (preferably something that adds consistency).&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Inferno Reckless Summon"">Inferno Reckless Summon</a></strong> is a really good card to use here to bring out the copies of&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Vic Viper T301"">Vic Viper T301</a></strong>. Not only that, but it can also be used for the other ships with <strong><a data-name=""Iron Call"">Iron Call</a></strong>.</p><p><strong><a data-name=""Gold Gadget"">Gold Gadget</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a></strong> help with XYZ summoning and swarming the field.

The deck nobody plays, except me. But hey, I made a list, come take a look.","I explained all the cards in this deck so you better read this. Overall, this is more like a template as you can take out/add cards if you want. The side deck is just my suggestions for cards to add, and don't have to be used as an extra deck.

<strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>

<span><strong>Astral Kuriboh:</strong></span> Free level 8 for basically no cost, also grants amazing protection. Pair with <strong>Number 97: Draglubion</strong> for a near impenetrable monster, but sadly loses it's protection effect if you rank up the monster. 3 recommended.

<strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll:</span></strong> Summons by discarding a Gimmick Puppet which is great to get [Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll] and [Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler] out of the hand and into the graveyard. It's graveyard effect is very great against disruption decks. 3 recommended

<strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll:</span></strong> Just a great card overall, only downside is you have to control only gimmick puppets. 3 recommended.

<span><strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll:</strong></span> The engine of the deck, would be great if it did not lock you into only using it to summon Gimmick Puppet XYZ. It also does nothing in your hand, which is why I use <strong>Trade-In</strong>. Also a great target for <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. 3 recommended.

<span><strong>Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler:</strong></span> The fact that it cannot be destroyed by battle makes it an amazing target for <strong>Puppet Parade</strong>, it's summon from the grave effect is situational but has it's moments. But sucks as a XYZ material as it banishes itself if it would be sent to the graveyard as an XYZ material. 1-2 recommended.

<strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Humpty Dumpty: </span></strong><span><span>A great way to get Gimmick Puppets out of the hand, while being level 4 it is a great way to summon <strong>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll </strong>and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll</strong></span><span>. Also works with <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. 2-3 recommended.</span></span>

<strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby: </span></strong><span>A great way to grab Gimmick Puppets out of the graveyard, also a great way to summon <strong>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll </strong>and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll</strong>. It's graveyard effect is also great to counter negates. Also works with <strong>Machine Duplication</strong>. 2-3 recommended.</span>

<span><strong>Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju: </strong><span>Can be replaced by any kaiju, used to counter negating monsters. Also a free level 8 if you draw 2 of them. 3 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher: </strong><span>Another good engine card, and the primary target for <strong>Foolish Burial</strong>. Can also be used to pop your opponents monsters if needed. 1 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Desperado Barrel Dragon: </strong><span>A great card overall due to it's high attack, summoning itself when a dark machine is destroyed, and destroying up to 3 monsters and maybe drawing a card. Also a great target for the secondary effect of <strong>Heavy Metal Raiders</strong>. 2-3 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Spells</strong></span>

<strong><span>Monster Reborn: </span></strong><span>It's <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>, what else is there to say? 1 recommended (Limit 1).</span>

<strong><span>Junk Puppet: <span>Monster Reborn </span></span></strong><span><span>but for Gimmick Puppets, also nothing else to say. 1-2 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Condolence Puppet: </strong></span>A card that helps gets <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler,</strong> and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll</strong> to the graveyard. Also has a very nice protection effect for your Gimmick Puppet XYZ. 2-3 recommended.

<strong><span>Foolish Burial: </span></strong><span>Primarily for <span><strong>Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher </strong>but can also but used for <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler,</strong> and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll</strong>. 1 recommended (Limit 1).</span></span>

<span><strong>Machine Duplication:</strong></span> A free summons with <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll</strong>, <strong>Gimmick Puppet Humpty Dumpty</strong>, and <strong>Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby</strong>. 2-3 recommended.

<span><strong>Trade-In: </strong><span>Great way to get <strong>Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler,</strong> and<strong> Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll</strong> to the graveyard as well as letting you draw 2. 2-3 recommended, alternative is <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong>.</span></span>

<span><span><span><strong>XYZ Shift: </strong></span> You might not think this card is good, but trust me it works. It's strongest use is to go into <strong>Number 88: </strong><strong>Gimmick Puppet of Leo </strong>with this card and then rank-up into <strong>Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo</strong>. Not only do you no longer need 3 materials as you can just go into another XYZ monster then use this, it also lets you use <strong>Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo's </strong>game winning effect much easier, due to having 2 less materials to deal with. Can also be used to switch between <strong>Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings/Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings </strong>and <strong>Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder/Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter</strong> if you need Strings ATK or Grinders effect. Can be dropped if you want, I just think it's neat. 0-2 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Lightning Storm:</strong> <span>Since Gimmick Puppets like going second, this is a great card. Doesn't need much explaining. 2 recommended.</span></span>

<strong>Harpies Feather Duster: </strong>Wiping your opponents backrow is great as Gimmick Puppets don't have it themselves, great way to counter floodgates. 1 recommended (Limit 1)

<span><strong>Heavy Metal Raiders: </strong></span>Very good field spell in this deck as all Gimmick Puppets are dark machines (Besides Egg Head and Gear Changer but I don't use em anyway). Great way to protect all your low ATK Gimmick Puppets and the second effect is a great way to get bricky cards out of your hand. 2-3 recommended.

<span><strong>Perform Puppet: </strong><span>It's first effect is very situational but has it's uses. The secondary effect is a great way to recycle Gimmick</span></span><span>s that are banished, and can result in you sometimes getting free summons of Gimmick Puppet XYZ. 1 recommended.</span>

<span><strong>Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force: </strong><span>Needed to rank up your Gimmick Puppet XYZ, it's recycle effect is very good and can be searched with <strong>Puppet Parade</strong>. 2 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force: </strong></span>Once again, needed to rank up your Gimmick XYZ. But it's ability to negate all cards on the field is so incredibly good and can save you the game, only issue is it negates your cards too so be careful. 2 recommended.

<strong><span>Traps</span></strong>

<span><strong>Puppet Parade: </strong></span><span>The card that has single handedly clutched my games countless times. It's ability to summon up to 5 Gimmick Puppets is just incredible, and the setting of a rank-up spell is just icing on the cake. 3 very much recommended.</span>

<strong><span>Extra Deck</span></strong>

<strong><span>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll: </span></strong><span>A great searcher and can get you out of a jam, also a way to use your level 4's. But locks you into Machine XYZ extra deck if you use it's effect. 1-2 recommended.</span>

<span><strong>Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll: </strong><span>Stealing your opponents monsters is very good, but it usually gets stopped. Even then you can't attack nor summon any other monsters except Gimmick Puppet XYZ monsters. 1 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder/Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter: </strong><span>Both are great for wiping out your opponents monsters, especially since Grinder can use it's effect twice. The burn damage they both provide is great. 1-2 of each recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings/Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings: </strong></span><span>These are your monster wipes, it's incredibly satisfying to destroy all your opponents monsters they spent 5 minutes summoning. Drawing a card and the burn damage are extremely good as well, but it's second effect is practically useless. Also have a high ATK value. 2 of each recommended.</span>

<span><strong>Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo/Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo: </strong><span>Use these at your own risk, as they are usually only used for memeing. But they have high attack and disaster leo cannot be targeted by card effects, but disaster leo needs to lose all of it's materials to use it's win con, that is why I use <strong>XYZ Shift</strong>. If your gonna get rid of leo/disaster leo, drop <strong>XYZ Shift</strong> too. 0-1 of each recommended.</span></span>

<strong><span>Dingirsu, Orcust of the Evening Star: </span></strong><span>Great protection and non-targeting removal, also bypasses <strong>Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll's </strong>restriction. 1 recommended.</span>

<span><strong>Number 97: Draglubion: </strong><span>Primarily used to summon <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong>, but when paired with <strong>Astral Kuriboh </strong>is extremely difficult to get over. 1 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon:</strong> <b>≥</b><span>9000 ATK beatstick primarily used as an OTK, but has a neat side effect when it is destroyed by a card effect. 1 recommended.</span></span>

<span><strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Titanic Galaxy:</strong> <span>V</span>ery great negation and the ability to change attack target to it is also pretty good. But usually used for <strong>Number 97: Draglubion </strong>material.</span>

ABOUT NUMBER 100/NUMBER 97: If you do not want the OTK, scrap these 2 and add whatever you want. Maybe another Chimera Doll and Number 23. OR if you want to lean into the OTK but don't want to use Number 38, scrap Number 88/C88 and add Number 99 and a Chimera Doll.

<span><strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky</strong> <strong>Thunder:<span> </span></strong><span><span>Duh, easy board wipe.</span></span></span>

<strong><span>Side Deck: </span></strong><span>Cards you could swap/add to the deck if you want, not an actual extra deck.</span>

<span><b>Infinite </b><span><b>Impermanence/Forbidden Droplet/Any Hand Trap: </b><span>Easy negates.</span></span></span>

<span><strong>The Beginning of the End/Allure of Darkness/Advance Draw/Pot of Avarice/Triple Tactics Talent: </strong><span>DRAW POWER!!!</span></span>

<span><strong>Glorious Numbers: </strong></span>Revive Numbers, great for N88/C88 as no materials. It's secondary effect is meh.

<span><strong>Gravity Bind: </strong></span>FLOODGATE

<span><strong>Limiter Removal: </strong><span>Honestly would put this in the deck if it wasn't over 45 already. Great for OTK's.</span></span>

<span><strong>XYZ Import:</strong> <span>Monster stealing is pretty pog ngl.</span></span>

<span><strong>Twin Twisters: </strong><span>Since they don't have enough backrow removal.</span></span>

<span><strong>Resurgam XYZ: </strong><span>Pretty decent effects but overall not the best.</span></span>

<strong><span>Marshalling Field: </span></strong><span><span>Don't use this unless you plan to drop all non machine monsters (Recommended to use Gearspring Spirit if this is the case). Actually useless, I don't remember why I put this in, oh yeah it's second effect is pretty good I guess.</span></span>

For full combos, watch: https://youtu.be/3Qo1md1fGiw","For whatever reason, this deck profile got deleted and I'm re-uploading it. I posted about it and literally got nothing from anyone.

Now, this deck is a tournament level deck. It is incredibly consistent and really fun to play. It has easy to pick combos. The main board you want to achieve every time is ""Decode Talker Heatsoul, Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir and Cynet Conflict."" Of course, this will not be possible with every hand, so Decode Talker Heatsoul should always be your go to card in any board you make. Those 2 draws are crucial since you run quite a good number of Hand Traps.
In this build, I added 2 cards that doesn't exist in the original build: Cynet Crosswipe &amp; Grave of the Super Ancient Organism. Both are great cards. Cynet Crosswipe is an extra interruption if you already have Cynet Conflict in hand, so with Micro Coder's search, grab it. Grave of the Super Ancient Organism shuts down combo decks all together.

For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game.

So it's been awhile hasn't it? Well after a couple weeks of stress, anxiety, and endless agony; I've made a significant return that happens to be not as enveloping as the deck I made today. That deck involving a three-way orgy of absolute field builders; the deck in question (alongside a particular archetype that has been the vocal point for months) will involve more of a long game, than the usual blitzkrieg playstyle I normally would demonstrate when showcasing my decks. Rather the endgame would be to build the best board possible, regardless of the circumstances and the <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> like nukes being drawn.

So to begin with, I have the ""Adventurer"" package: the stuff that I know about, you know about, and even Konami knows too much about. Not gonna talk too much about it because it's been done one too many times already since it's inception. Next comes the ""P.U.N.K"": which despite the lackluster cardpool and (for this build) no inclusion of <a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K Ogre Dance"">Noh-P.U.N.K Ogre Dance</a>; the deck I made being a three-way, and not a two-way indicates that Ogre Dance isn't necessarily needed at the moment (although I played the card at 1 copy for the sake of being a searcher for <a data-name=""Noh-P.U.N.K Deer Note"">Noh-P.U.N.K Deer Note</a>). Finally comes the Tenyi package, which did come in handy for quite a bit of circumstances (such as getting a Tuner to go into <a data-name=""Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign-Chengying"">Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign-Chengying</a>, bouncing a burdening target to your hand, and Special summoning another ""Tenyi"" monster to go to into a Link Climb).

The BLS is just there cuz its my favorite card, though its been more helpful that not I've found (banishing removal is nice for stuff like Chengying that don't want to be destroyed). 3 Judgment dragon is there because by the time you get it into your hand, its usually live, and being able to blow up the board is always nice. Even if it's destruction effect isn't useful in the moment, it's a free 8 star light monster you can use for something like Curious, Barron, or even Harbinger."

The last Machina support released in Masterduel July 2022, that card being Machina Ruinforce. With Machina now in full force power, The Masterduel ladder is ripe to receive Machnia's mechanized destruction!

Excellent support for the archetype includes <em>Machina Citadel</em>, which functions as a quick effect board wipe of all your opponent’s monsters which is a very potent form of interruption. <em>Machina Overdrive</em> enables a circular resource loop between the banished pile, GY, deck and hand, while <em>Machina Redeployment</em> greatly increased the consistency of the deck. Newer support from main sets like <em>Unclaspare (R4NK enabler, free special summon and foolish burial)</em> and <em>Ruinforce (4600ATK beatstick and banish recursion) </em>have also greatly increased the power for this archetype.

The resulting support turns Machina from an archetype that was a jumbled mess into a compact powerful fighting force that can succeed in a grind game. Together with high impact staple trap cards and crippling floodgates, Machina functions as an anti-meta deck versus the combo-heavy meta! Control the game, simplify the game-state, then OTK your opponent in one fell swoop with your high ATK Machina army!

Once out, the plan is to ideally swarm the deck with level 4 dragon monsters that can be drawn or searched via Armed Dragon, the Armed Dragon's effect or DDA's effect and summing Queen Dragun Djinn to protect your dragon monsters from attacks, as well as beefing her up with Tyrant Wing or Castle of Dragon Souls to prevent her being destroyed too early after summoning.

Another strategy is to summon Armed Dragon, the armed Dragon and then using his effect to summon Azure Eyes Silver Dragon and then utilising his effect to special summon one of the many Dragon normal type monsters such as Hyozanryu or the Luster Dragons. I also packed a few Raigeki to quickly clear the field and directly attack your opponent with an army of dragons.

Another key strategy is using Dragon Ravine, Dragon Shrine and DDA to send as many Dragon type monsters to graveyard and using Dragon's mirror to summon Five-Headed Dragon."

GX SPIRIT CALLER</strong> you collect multiple duel spirits that give your character passive buffs; to level up the spirits, their card has to be face-up on the field to gain experience when you win, nothing else.</em>

I'm not going to lie, this is a terrible deck. First thing to note, this is every Thunder-type monster in the game; one advantage is ""<em>when you win</em>"" you'll get the [Limited ATTRIBUTE] &amp; [Limited Type] experience bonus, leading to faster levelling up. Try to stall until you can summon <strong>Sanga of the Thunder</strong>, use <strong>Batteryman D</strong> as a wall to protect your field, use trap cards to destroy enemy monsters. If you can special summon <strong>Batteryman D</strong>, and combo with <strong>Aqua Chorus</strong> you'd get a wall that would stall most of the opponents. If you tribute summon <strong>Zaborg </strong>his effect is mandatory, so play <strong>Cost Down</strong> if you want an easy summon. Just use this to grind no-named duelists, until your <em>Batterymen</em>, or <strong>Wattkid</strong> (<em>Oscillo Hero #2</em>) reach max level.

<em>Side Deck</em>: If you acquired <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong> (from Blair)/<strong>Monster Reborn</strong> (from Atticus), replace <strong>Heavy Storm</strong>, or <strong>Premature Burial</strong>. If you haven't unlocked <strong>Wattkid</strong>/<strong>Batteryman C</strong>, fill your deck with <strong>Solar Ray</strong>/<strong>Elf's Light</strong>. I use <strong>Umi</strong> field spell since it would depower Machine-types, no one in the game plays Pyro-types."

This deck incorporate the consistent and full tank Drytron engine and adds elements to limit its biggest weaknesses. It should also be noted that this is meant for TCG and is a relatively affordable <em>more</em> <em>BUDGET </em>option for Drytron that doesn't require any cards over $30.

</ol>
<strong>Even Matchups</strong>

<strong>Weaknesses</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Droll - Stops full combo- deck relies on draws. Thankfully won't be main decked in 99% of decks.</li>
 	<li>Dimensional Shifter - Stops full combo - deck relies on key assets in GY not banished. This is a reason why <em>Floowandereeze </em>is a difficult matchup</li>
 	<li>D.D. Crow - On weaker hands banishing a key Drytron name or on strong hands banishing ritual spell prevents full combo</li>
 	<li>Special Summon Restrictions - Barrier Statue, Vanities, Winda</li>
 	<li>Certain flood gates ranked from most damaging to least damaging - Summon Limit &gt; Anti-spell fragrance &gt; Rivalry (if timed right) &gt; Zombie World &gt; TCOBO &gt; Skill Drain</li>
 	<li>Massive negate heavy boards - Has a lot of tools to play around this...</li>
 	<li>2+ Hand Traps - This deck can surprisingly play well through 2/3 handtraps with it's best hands but weaker hands can be stopped easily with disruption unless... (see below)</li>

 	<li>Vendread - If played early enough can completely prevent 90% of handtraps, especially Nib. At the very least great bait for handtraps.</li>
 	<li>Instant fusion + Millienium Eyes Restrict - Protects rest of combo from handtraps, decks best counter against droll (Would run 3 if I could). Can also be used for level 1 XYZ plays and Curious combo.</li>
 	<li>Triple Tactic Talents - Can gain leverage if hit with a hand trap by drawing 2 AND can help going second when up against a massive negate board</li>
 	<li>Dark Ruler No More - Main decking this is a must. Ensures deck has going 2nd survivability. Would play 3 droplet as well if not for $.</li>
 	<li>Called by the Grave - Staple</li>
 	<li>Harpies - Mostly to know you have a Mystic mine out</li>
</ol>
<strong>Side Deck Counters</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Lava Golem - Excellent against combo boards (<em>Sword Soul</em>)</li>
 	<li>Lancea - Excellent against <em>Floowandereeze</em></li>
 	<li>Token Collector - Excellent against <em>Sword Soul</em></li>
 	<li>Twin Twister + Cosmic Cyclone - Back row and mystic mine decks</li>
 	<li>Dark hole - Mystic mine + going second</li>
 	<li>Red Reboot - Eldlich</li>
 	<li>TCOBO - Switch out antispell for this against <em>Floowandereeze</em></li>
 	<li>Quadrantids - When you know you are going first or against backrow, nice extra ritual card</li>
</ol>

If you want to start your Evil Twin combo and use the Adventurer engine in the same turn, normal summon your Live Twin monster and then use Live Twin Home to special summon the other Live Twin monster in order to do so.

Small World is an excellent card to get your combo started or even to extend it by just banishing any handtrap you may have to grab a Twin monster or even Water Enchantress. Additionally, if you've got your girls on the board already and you have a Ki-sikil or a Lil-la in your hand, you could use Small World to banish them and Droll to bring out an Ash for your opponent's turn. That's the magical thing about this card!

I'll try to update the decklist as I play more to see what I can do to improve the deck. If you have any suggestions to improve the deck or side deck in any way, feel free to let me know."

After I've been thinking about some personal sh#t in my life for the past few days, I finally got off my @$$ and made some deck profiles for Kazuki Takahashi as tribute to his legacy. At 60 years old, he was taken from us too soon, and the Yu-Gi-Oh community did not deserve this tragedy. My Takahashi-themed decks will be of archetypes who were either revealed during the era they were based on, or whose key cards were revealed during that era.

&nbsp;

This is my SEVENS-era deck and my final deck for the Kazuki Takahashi series. This is a pure P.U.N.K. deck I made with their newest cards--P.U.N.K. JAM Dragon Drive and P.U.N.K. JAM Extreme Session! This deck runs 9 hand traps, so it can go second and do pretty well. It can also go first and summon Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity on their turn."

Maximus Dragma is one of your main extra deck destruction tools, being able to be special summoned by banishing extra deck monsters from your grave, meaning you can generate bodies on the field by getting rid of dead cards that were sent by Nadir, Punishment, White Knight/Relic, Branded Central, Dogmatikalamity, this card locks you out of your extra deck for the remainder of your turn. Dogmatika Ashiyan can summon itself if a extra deck monster was sent to the GY which is an easy condition to fulfil with this deck, upon summon you can retrieve from your grave any Dogmatika card, it also has an effect that gives 500ATK/DEF boost to your Dogmatika monsters if your opponent declares an attack. Fleur De Lis the Dogmatika Knight, sharing the same special summon condition as Ecclesia, is your archetypal Eveiler she is better in comparison due to the negate effect not targeting, her other effect is similar to Ashiyan giving your Dogmatikas a 500ATK/DEF boost when you declare an attack. The Heretics: Lets start with their Lv8 ritual monster White Knight of Dogmatika, this card has the continuous effect of not allowing you to special summon from your extra deck, now for its positive effects when your opponent activates any card or effect you can send 1 monster from both players extra decks to the GY, and if you do this card gains half of their combined attack, which most of the time generates a 3k'ish White Knight, pairing it with Ashyan and Fleur you can get some big numbers. As for their Lv4 ritual monsters White Relic of Dogmatika, unlike Knight this card doesnt lock you out of your extra deck and it is mentioned in a ritual spell, which means P-Prep of Rites works with it, when summoned she can make one monster gain the ATK equal to another monster on the field, it also has a passive effect that protect your Lv8 Dogmatikas from being destroyed by battle which doesnt come up as often, the effect you are using this card for allows her to send 1 monster from your opponent's extra deck when your opponent dares to summon anything from it. Prayers and Curses: Dogmatikas have 2 ritual spells and 1 ritual trap, starting with the spells Dogmatikalamity is one of the best ritual spell cards in game by being able to use monsters from your extra deck as requirements for the summons, so for the summon of Relic you can send Elder Entity N'tss or even Herald of the Arc Light, as for White Knight cards like Psy-Framelord Omega or Titaniklad the Ash Dragon. Their second spell that is searcheable via P-Prep is Dogmatikabre which lets you summon any Dogma ritual monsters from your hand or GY, it also allows you to banish ed monsters from your grave to fulfil the requirements for the ritual summon, it also has an effect that triggers if both Knight and Relic are on the field, allowing you to look at either your or your opponent's extra deck to send 1 card from it to the grave, the main thing you will be doing with this card is banishing your ""dead"" extra deck monsters. As for their unique ritual trap Dogmatikaturgy summons any Dogmatika ritual monster from your deck or hand by tributing Dogmatika or extra deck monsters on your field. You are mostly using this card for its second effect which shuffles back from the GY into the deck 1 dogmatika monster and adds another one to your hand. The Ammo for your Dogmatikas (and Artemate Slay): <strong>Fusions:</strong> &diams; Titaniklad the Ash dragon: During the EP adds or summons one Dogmatika from your deck &diams; Elder Entity N'tss: Destroys a card when its sent to the GY (not once per turn) <strong>Synchro:</strong> &diams; PSY-Framelord Omega: Recycles itself and 1 cards in the GY being basically infinite ammo&nbsp; &diams; Wind Pegasus @Ignister: Shuffles into the deck 1 card your opponent controls if they destroy one of your cards be it via battle or card effect &diams; Herald of the Arc Light: Ritual monster/spell searcher (not once per turn) <strong>Xyz:</strong> &diams; Toadally Awesome: Self Recycling <strong>LINK:</strong> &diams; Five-Headed Link Dragon: Big body for Dogmatika Punishment &diams; Borrelcode Dragon: Banishes 1 dark monster with 3000ATK from the field to summon to your field a Topologic, in this case I chose to run Bomber Dragon &diams; Topologic Bomber Dragon: Read above &diams; Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden: A way to get one of your low level spellcasters in the GY &diams; Paleozoic Cambroraster: Protect your set cards</p>"

Creating unbreakable boards with over 7+ negates.,"Here I bring you the most consistent combo deck you could ever want or wish! This deck features 60 cards of perfectly calculated cards needed to create an unbreakable 7 negate board with every hand possible. Only requiring 3 general cards for each hand to create amazing end boards with skill and fulfilled plays to make it.

Lets first discuss what do you need for an opening hand? Thanks to the new dracoslayer cards, we have a new stronger way of making combos. Your hand should consist of any 2 Igknight pendulum monsters and a <a data-name=""Ignis Phoenix, the Dracoslayer"">Ignis Phoenix, the Dracoslayer</a>, this hand along with 1 discard card creates an unbreakable board with over 7 negates. Alternatively, Your hand could also consist of any 4 Igknight pendulum monsters as 2 of them become a Ignis Phoenix. Every card in this deck will create a variation of both of these hands since we play already 24 Igknight's, + 16 cards that can search them. Including the extender cards, this deck has 46 main cards that you always wanna see in your hand making it the most consistent possible.

With those hands in mind, you should be able to pull off a board like the two below (imgur link):

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/eoevC3H"">https://imgur.com/a/eoevC3H</a>

To make this board, we perform the following combo:
<ol>
 	<li>Activate 1 Igknight pendulum monster and Ignis Phoenix, then activate the Igknight's effect to add a FIRE warrior-type monster; Add a Sublimation Knight if not already in hand.</li>
 	<li>Trigger Ignis Phoenix effect to summon a <a data-name=""Majesty Pegasus, the Dracoslayer"">Majesty Pegasus, the Dracoslayer</a>. On it's summon you search your field spell of your choosing (whatever you have sided in) to then have whatever card in your hand discarded.</li>
 	<li>Normal summon <a data-name=""Sublimation knight"">Sublimation knight</a> using its effect to equip <a data-name=""Squeaknight"">Squeaknight</a>. Use Squeaknight's effect to special summon itself. Do NOT use it's effect to turn itself into a tuner monster. Use both your Sublimation knight and Squeaknight to Link summon Isolde.</li>
 	<li>Use isolde's effect to add from your deck to your hand another Igknight monster, one that has a scale opposite to the one in hand. (i.e. If you have a scale 7 in hand, search for a Igknight with a scale 2). Use Isolde's second effect to special summon Infernoble Knight Renaud from your deck by sending a living fossil, triggering Renaud's effect to hand to your hand your Living fossil from the GY. (If you already have Renaud in hand, summon Fire Flint Lady instead from your deck sending Living Fossil, then you can summon itself from it's own ability).</li>
 	<li>Remembering that Majesty Pegasus is a Tuner, you use Isolde and Majesty Pegasus to Link summon Crystron Halqifibrax, which then summons a Red Rose Dragon from your deck or hand.</li>
 	<li>Use Red Rose Dragon and Renaud to Synchro summon into Herald of the Arc Light, summoning into the far main zone so its not in a link zone so we can pendulum summon later. Triggering Red Rose's effect to special summon Roxrose Dragon from your hand or deck into a main zone so its not in a link zone. Triggering it's effect to add to hand Basel Rose Shoot from your deck.</li>
 	<li>You can now activate both of the 2 Igknight monsters in your hand as scales. Using them to pendulum summon out of your extra deck both of your dracoslayers to the zones from Halqifibrax.</li>
 	<li>Using both of your Dracoslayers, link summon a Artifact Dagda. Then you can use either Rose Shoot to summon Red Rose Dragon from GY or use Living fossil targetting Sublimation knight, where you can then chain Artifact Dagda to set a Artifact Scythe. Then use your other spell in hand to summon the other monster so your board is full.</li>
 	<li>Using Artifact Dagda, Roxrose Dragon, Red Rose Dragon and Sublimation knight to link summon into an Apollousa. From here you would activate your Igknight pendulum effect to add to your hand Therion ""Bull"" Ain from your deck or GY.</li>
 	<li>Activate Therion Bull's effect to special summon itself by targeting a warrior in your GY, where you target Squeaknight. You can then use Sqeaknight effect again to special summon itself. Here, you DO activate it's effect to make itself a Tuner. Using your Therion Bull and Squeaknight you can Synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon, equiping to it either Artifact Dagda or Isolde.</li>
 	<li>Finally you would activate your field spell of choice, I prefer Therion Discollesium, which will add to my hand Therion Regulus that will special summon itself by targeting and equiping Therion Bull in my GY.</li>
</ol>
Weak Points: This Deck unfortunately suffers through a lot of handtraps, especially Droll and Lock bird, Nibiru and well targeted infinite impermanence. Luckily we do have some play around them, hence why we play 2 isolde's so that even if it gets effect veiler'd or infinite we can make another simply enough. Another trick to remember is that the Igknight pendulum effect to destroy the scales is an effect and not a cost. So your opponent can ashe blossum them, but it doesn't destroy your scales and they are not once per turn. That catches a few players off every now and then.

Your hands will not always be perfect and follow the guideline, but with some clever thinking you are able of pulling through to your final board everytime I guarantee it (as long as you are not interupted :P). This deck is much more weaker on the going second front in terms of playing through your opponent, hence why the side deck is just filled with going second cards, enough to destroy or use up some resource of your opponents to progress through your own combo.

Strong Points: It's fun as hell braining your way through to try and generate these boards while trying to keep in mind everything you have done so far. Versatile to playing around any certain strategy your opponent may be playing, with knightmares for removal, secret village for spell lock down, and a plethera of extra deck monsters all able to try and break down an opposing board if going second. Don't except this to go Meta due to it's glass cannon nature, but boy is it fun!

Hope you found this deck interesting a fun! Let me know if I am missing of anything that would be worth implementing and let me know your experience with this deck!"

The deck is built around the concept of summoning Slifer as quick as possible to blow up the enemy field with ""Thunderforce Attack"" and/or ""Harpie's Feather Duster"".

While in the hand, Slifer can be normal summoned easily using many cards that create a lot of tokens, such as ""Scapeghost"" and ""Reactor Slime"", or you can Special Summon an ""Egyptian God Slime"" using Reactor Slime's effects (it represents a triple tribute for a Divine-Beast);  ""Pot of Greed"" (still banned but who cares, this deck is built merely for fun) ensures more draws, more deck speed and therefore more power for Slifer; ""Reload"" can turn a bad hand into a full combo ready to summon Slifer: the probabilities to draw Card Advance and The True Name at the same time are doubled.

Maxx ""C"" is the perfect jolly to play against an opponent that relies on Special Summons: discard Maxx ""C"" while your opponent is Special Summoning and your hand will become fully of extra cards of your deck. This not only increased the possibilieties to draw ""The True Name"" and/or ""Card Advance"" but it makes Slifer even more powerfull. The ""Yosenju Kama 1-2-3"" cards are the Slifer's recharge in ATK: they all return to the hand in End Phase, even if they are in the graveyard.

""Soul Crossing"" is here to represent an alternative to ""Card Advance"" to summon Slifer: soul crossing give an extra normal summon exclusively for a Divine-Beast monster, it's a quick spell card (means that if it's Set, you can active it during the opponent's turn) and, finally, you can sacrifice any number of your opponent's monster for this specific summon. Soul crossing is a jolly that can easily overturn the game.

The field magic card ""Mound of the Bound Creator"" protect Slifer from being targeted or destroyed by card effects. The trap card ""Reckless Greed"" is the perfect ambush while Slifer is on the field and an opponent's monster with higher ATK attacks your Divine-Beast: this trap gives to Slifer extra 2000 ATK in a blink, possibly saving the game.

The strategy is all here: the other cards are there for general utility and you can be creative and modify it as you will. I hope you have fun with this deck (besides, this cards aren't too much expensive)."

These two new group of cards alone shakes up the meta game to a considerable amount, seeing as the Adventure engine is splashable in everything and is good going 1st and 2nd, while the Floowandereeze deck allows you to win going 1st by setting up an impressive board that wins you the game unless they have dark ruler/droplet. This deck is in my opinion one of the best ways to abuse this engine outside of a few exceptions. Now without further ado, lets dive right in.

&nbsp;

The deck is similar to a list that was very successful not to long ago in the TCG, utilizing level 3s to make Cherubini and set up your adventure plays alongside Halqifibrax to make your end board of <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light, </a><a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur, Phoenix Enforcer, and a set scythe to completely blow your opponent out of the water! You can also go second with this deck exceptionally well due to the amount of extenders you play as well as the utility cards you can run, which we can get into later. All in all, this deck has very strong combos that combat the format pretty well.</a>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The main combo:

Sangan + level 3 extender:

normal summon Sangan

special summon level 3 extender

make Cherubini

trigger Sangan to add Arboria

Cherubini to send Water Enchantress

Water Enchantress to search Rite of Aramaseir

Rite to special summon a token and place Fateful Adventure

special summon Arboria

summon Halq using the Cherubini and Arboria

Halq as chain link 1 and Fateful as chain link 2 to prevent your Halqifibrax from getting ashed, which means you'll be grabbing a Dracoback with Fateful and you'll be summoning Red Rose Dragon off of Halq

Fateful effect to search for Gryphon Rider and pitch the Dracoback, which you can (and should) trigger to reequip itself to the token

special summon Gryphon Rider since you control the Adventure Token

synchro off Gryphon Rider and Red Rose to make Baronne de Fleur, triggering Red Rose to summon Roxrose from deck, which will add you Basal Rose Shoot.

synchro the Adventure Token and Roxrose into a Yazi

use Baronne's effect to pop Yazi, which will trigger it to special summon Mare Mare from the deck.

use Mare Mare's effect once to make a Token

use the newly made Token and Halqifibrax to make Dagda

use Basal Rose Shoot to special summon a Rose Dragon from grave, then trigger Dagda to set an Artifact Scythe.

use Mare Mare one more time to make a Token

use Token and Roxrose to make a Herald of the Arc Light

use Dagda and Mare Mare to make Verte

Verte effect, sending Fusion Destiny to fusion summon Enforcer using materials from the deck (although they are banished, though that doesn't matter too much)

Pass your turn

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

With that combo, you get two omni negates (a negate for anything) through Baronne and Herald, a mini floodgate in Herald of the Arc Light (monsters sent from deck/hand are banished instead), and a scythe lock (DPE popping the set scythe in the standby, triggering Scythe).

&nbsp;

<em>Side Deck</em>: switch out <strong>White Magician Pikeru</strong>/<strong>Ebon Magician Curran </strong>depending on which Spirit you have equipped. If you didn't unlock <strong>Reckless Greed</strong> (secret pack <em>Thirst for Victory</em>) I recommend <strong>Sixth Sense</strong> (post-game pack <em>Deep Shadows</em>), choose 5-6 high risk, high reward. If you unlocked <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong> (unlocked from Blair, extremely hard to get), switch out <strong>Heavy Storm;</strong> and replace <strong>Sixth Sense </strong>with <strong>Reckless Greed </strong>because deck limitations for forbidden cards. <strong>Little-Winguard </strong>option, if you want an early game monster to poke and go to defense, doesn't really have synergy with the rest of the deck."

Quickly fill your graveyard with union, or high level monsters to summon later; either use <strong>Foolish Burial</strong>, or discard with <span>XYZ-Dragon Cannon</span>, or <strong>Damage Condenser</strong>, to summon Aitsu, or Soitsu and put their union partner in the grave. Activate <strong>Roll Out!</strong> to equip you Union-monster and gain their effect.

Fall back on the X-Y-Z monsters for reliable hitters, the game doesn't have that many beatsticks, and fewer backrow removal.

<em>Side Deck</em>: If you haven't unlocked <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> from Atticus use <strong>Premature Burial</strong>. If you want to be more combat heavy, use <strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky</strong>; play <strong>Agido</strong> late into the game, when it is destroyed, any roll from 3-6 will summon a fairy.

This is my ARC-V themed deck, Burning Abyss. Unfortunately, I suck harder than moms in early 2000s' hentai at playing Pendulums, so I went with Burning Abyss instead. Generally, the deck does well first or second, but this specific build is better off going on the offensive.  In addition to the standard 6 hand traps, it runs 3 Forbidden Droplets and 2 Lightning Storm and 1 Harpie's Feather Duster."

After I've been thinking about some personal sh#t in my life for the past few days, I finally got off my @$$ and made some deck profiles for Kazuki Takahashi as tribute to his legacy. At 60 years old, he was taken from us too soon, and the Yu-Gi-Oh community did not deserve this tragedy. My Takahashi-themed decks will be of archetypes who were either revealed during the era they were based on, or whose key cards were revealed during that era.

&nbsp;

My ZEXAL-themed deck is Trains, with Clockwork Night and Foolish Burial Goods as tech choices. For the most part, I send Clockwork Night to the graveyard (either with Revolving Switchyard or Goods) to get more search power. Also, combo'd with some other cards, you can search Flying Pegasus Railway Stampede and get a total of 3 Level 10 Machines on the field, for 2 Rank 10 Xyz monsters.

&nbsp;

Even with the extra searching and summoning power that Clockwork Night and FBG provide, you want to go second. Trains are still very much a go-second deck.

&nbsp;

This is my 5Ds-era deck, Nordic (with an Adventurer Token engine). I didn't have many options for 5Ds-era archetypes to choose, either because those archetypes are terrible, or they are too complicated for me to play. So I went with Nordics, which are admittedly still very lacking as an archetype. The reason for the name is obvious. Because of the Adventurer Token engine and Nordics' whole ""defend the castle"" playstyle, you wanna go first at all times."

After I've been thinking about some personal sh#t in my life for the past few days, I finally got off my @$$ and made some deck profiles for Kazuki Takahashi as tribute to his legacy. At 60 years old, he was taken from us too soon, and the Yu-Gi-Oh community did not deserve this tragedy. My Takahashi-themed decks will be of archetypes who were either revealed during the era they were based on, or whose key cards were revealed during that era.

&nbsp;

This is my GX-themed deck: Lost World Dinos. Babycerasaurus was a card used by Tyranno Hassleberry, one of my favorite characters from Yu-Gi-Oh GX. Ultimate Conductor Tyranno is basically a fusion of all of his ""Tyranno"" monsters, and Lost World is more or less a retrain of Jurassic World, which he used. Gameplay wise, this deck can go first or second, but I prefer to go second. It also has a Super Poly and Doodle Beast engine in the side deck.

&nbsp;

As for the name of this deck, ""Takahashodon"", it essentially translates to ""Takahashi's Tooth"" or ""Takahashi's Teeth"", as if it were referring to a prehistoric animal. It comes from the Greek root word ""odon"", which means ""tooth/teeth."" A lot of extinct animals have names with this root: <em>Dimetrodon, Iguanodon, Heterodontosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, Smilodon, Megalodon, Liopleurodon, Dimorphodon</em>, and so on."

After I've been thinking about some personal sh#t in my life for the past few days, I finally got off my @$$ and made some deck profiles for Kazuki Takahashi as tribute to his legacy. At 60 years old, he was taken from us too soon, and the Yu-Gi-Oh community did not deserve this tragedy. My Takahashi-themed decks will be of archetypes who were either revealed during the era they were based on, or whose key cards were revealed during that era. The first Takahashi-themed deck is Amazoness, which was originally played by Mai Valentine in Yu-Gi-Oh: Duel Monsters.

&nbsp;

Amazoness can do well going first, but going second for this deck in particular is heavily preferred, particularly due to the high amount of hand traps.

&nbsp;

As for the name of this deck, it's partially due to the fact that Takahashi drew the Amazoness monsters in the Yu-Gi-Oh manga, and they were originally really muscular. And as a proud muscle fetishi--*Ahem*...wheyfu enthusiast, I've always liked this archetype. Also, I saw Tania in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, and them biceps...Dayum!"

This deck truly makes you feel like the king of games.,This is  2022 version of Yugi motou's deck with a full on dedication to spellcasters. The deck is solid and can quickly swarm with lots of tough monsters and easily clear through opponent's field. It should be warn this deck is not meant to be played in a competitive sense but you should be able to get much enjoyment out of it when playing casually with friends. I must say this is really does feel like a deck that Yugi would use in the series.
