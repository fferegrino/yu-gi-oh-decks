SPYRAL HERO DM. I played it because it was the last list I sent to Pandor from the previous tournament I played (a locals) and I didn't have the time to build a deck for the Cup. Oddly, I lost both matches I played on that locals with this deck, while I finished undefeated the YTC.  What tech choices did you play?  I decided to play Apprentice Illusion Magician and Dark Magician as my secondary Soul targets. I also played Magicalized Fusion with the intention of using DM and any Spellcaster from GY to make The Dark Magicians, but the idea did't work and I ended up siding out the card every match (I made TDM a few times with Polymerization, tho). I also played SPYRAL MISSION - Recapture because I think it's actually good, since it both protects the Sleeper Summon from some common backrow cards like Torrential Tribite or Bottomless Trap Hole and the effect to take control of a monster is not that rare with all the revival I was playing.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  I'll 100% cut Magicalized for Oasis of Dragon Souls. I would also cut Apprentice since 2 Soul targets are enough. Also, with current proposed hits in mind, I would remove either Sleeper or Sleeper+Last Resort and Sunrise+Miracle Fusion, while going for 55 cards to keep Liquid Soldier.  How were your matchups?  Round 1 I played against Labcoat's Unchained Traptrix. It was very difficult because the Unchained big guy has non-targeting destruction, to the point I thought I was going to lose, but I managed to win since Sleeper is that strong. Round 2 was against Jmax's Machines. Sleeper did most of the work here. Round 3 vs WTrain's Unchained Shaddoll HERO. Opened really good both games. Won G1 thanks to Sleeper and G2 thanks to Fully Armed banishing both Construct and Winda. Round 4 my opponent was Tactic Lu. They oppened badly both games. Round 5 vs GuiltyGearxx's Chaos HERO Shaddoll. G1 I open badly and he opens really good so I lose. G2 I win thanks to Fully armed banishing Winda. G3 I summon Sleeper on my 1st turn and enters unninterrupted. Top 8 was vs Spiderking on Synchro Traptrix. G1 I went for a T1 Sleeper that got BTH'd, but since I was ahead on resources and I had enough responses I managed to summon Sleeper a second time. G2 he opened badly and I opened Vyon. Top 4 was vs Wtrain again. G1 I lose since he has more responses than I had starters. G2 I manage to outresource him. G3 it's literally Super Agent Beatdown, since he bricked and I summoned both Super Agent and Tough to use their effects and attacked. Finals was vs Tactic Lu. G1 I summoned Sleeper but got outed, and in the end my opponent attacking with Sera into Tough (It was set to avoid the trap Holes) and equipping Fully armed to him won me the game. G2 I could play through the interruptions my opponent had and I negated his Vyon. In the end I won by attacking into a timelord and activating Forbidden Chalice on it for Exact lethal damage."

Hero and Shaddoll are both very strong fusion decks at the moment with good consistentcy to search out fusion spells and the ability to easily trigger graveyard effects in both archetypes. Chaos Dragons are a powerful reward for using fusion plays to place cards in the GY and send cards like eclipse wyvern and brotaur to search big rewarding monsters. Neos fusion serves as an additional way to get to important play starters.  What tech choices did you play?  Added more light monsters since just a light with a fusion spell and shaddoll monster can enable access to the loop of recurring construct and other shaddoll fusions with the revival trap. For this reason I added seyfert and extra neos, though they were pretty unexceptional outside of fusion material. I tried to main as many consistency cards as possible knowing that targeted negations and handtraps would probably only come in from my opponent past game 1. After game 1 I can rely less on consistency and more on side cards. Hero lives was pretty questionable though and I didn't feel great about it.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  The main deck out values most decks, In subsequent games I tried to gain an advantage by siding handtraps that dealt with the vyon combo turn 1 and removal for traptrix, also some gy hate for spirits. That's pretty much it.  How were your matchups?  My side behaved extremely well this month. Mainly I only lost to sleeper and disruption. Ariel is extremely good vs spirits. Otherwise I just pretty much had the proper removal to deal with threats until top 8. I need more interaction I think, because I was always scared of aggro."

I decided to play dinos, because I’d always really enjoyed them and the last time I was going to play them, I changed decks at the last second. That’s about it  What tech choices did you play?  For tech choices, I was running Sales Pitch in the maindeck and Big Burn in the sideboard, along with the classic Pacifis cards. Sales Pitch is an amazing card, just due to the fact that its capable of searching any card in your deck. Combine that with the fact that most decks that were being played searched multiple times each duel, and the card has a good-fair chance of being live when drawn. Big Burn is my special anti-GY card. When it resolves, every monster in the GY is banished. Due to the fact that I’m playing dinos, I’m carrying a couple ways of recovering/playing around that (Giant Rex and Overtex Qoatlus), while a deck like Dark Spirit Unchained will become severely crippled upon resolution. Pacifis was included simply because Kabazauls and MegalosmasherX are the best cards in the deck, so why would I not want to play around them?  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  Due to the meta being rather GY oriented and floaty (floating on destruction/sending), I ran a number of cards in the Main Deck and Sideboard geared to counteract that (D.D. Crow, Called by the Grave, Big Burn, Jelly Cannon, Karma Cut, Paleozoic Dinomischus, Storming Mirror Force.) Was also maining Sales Pitch due to the level of searching that I expected to be occurring. Lastly, due to how Extra Deck focused most of the decks appeared to be, I was siding Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag in order to steal their monsters from the Extra Monster Zone and use them against my opponent.  How were your matchups?  Most of the matchups were fine. The only difficult matchups I had were vs Chaos HERO Dolls and Dark Spirit Unchained. Both decks have incredible recover and are capable of going extremely positive in card advantage, so it’s rather difficult for Dinos to deal with them without niche options.  How would you change the deck going forwards?  In the future, I’m looking forward to ETCO introducing Jewel Beast – Argosaurus which is an incredible card for dinos, due to it being able to search Double Evolution Pill, D.D. Crow and Masked Chameleon. I would aim to shift the deck from 60-card pacifis to lower decksize with more combos and easier access to specific cards."

I played Shaddoll HERO Traptrix Cyber Dragon, a kind of 4-way meta mash. I played it because HEROdolls were not hit since last cup and they were clearly best deck and I did pretty well last cup for my standards. Additionally Traptrix added another engine that wouldn't allow me to run out of gas. The general idea was to add a goal for all the HEROdoll advantage, and Traptrix gave them interruption, if my opponent didn't play into the Traptrix stuff, then I could play HEROdolls with extra backrow. Cydra were just a light engine to send off of Shaddoll Fusion for Construct since I heard not abusing Construct was playing the deck wrong but it was mostly useless.  What tech choices did you play?  I mostly picked my tech choices from an article/decklist Mika made on the most impactful side-deck and tech cards for this format, most of the spice is on the side deck, different Trap Holes for different decks. I guess running 3 Myrmelio is kind of a tech, mostly because I didn't want to run the other bad Traptrix.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  I didn't prepare for the meta more than reading the article mentioned above and implementing Traptrix as another way to never lose momentum. I don't think any of the big components of this deck will survive the next banlist, but in retrospect, 1 of the Myrmelio I was running could have been another Shadow Mist so I could play with the HERO part of the deck more often.  How were your matchups?  First game was against an illegal decklist. Second game was Mekk HERO which was really strong. Third game was pure-ish Traptrix, match was fun but since I was playing Traptrix too, I managed to steal Myrmelio and make Sera, game was always in my hand tho. Forth game was Spyral HERO and I got completely and utterly destroyed, Sleeper destroys this deck single handedly, beats over Wynda, pops Construct/Sunriser, immune to Absolute Zero and nobody would summon it to a Sera board. 5th game was against Traptrix Synchro and it was a tug of war, really fun but again was never in a losing position due to my advantage.  In the top 8 I rematched Mekk HERO and got a win via a topdeck war, which this deck seems to be adept at, then I played vs Gem-Knight which were sadly demolished by convinient hand traps, and lastly was defeated by Spyral in a way more interactive duel than I was expecting.  Most of these games I was safety netted by my deck just being strong and my luck being incredibly generous, except for the Spyral games."

With strong resource management and cards that offer heavy disruption and utility on your opponent's turn, Eldlich is definitely going to be a strong rogue-option moving forward in the yugioh meta. Though the TCG lacks a few of the cards that make the stun build of Eldlich more deadly, adding handtraps is always a solid way to make sure your opponent can't really play the game. Eldlich The Golden Lord makes going second or recovering from previous turns more bearable by offering additional removal and pushing for game."

The deck has many utilities by default just by being a Zombie Deck and Doomking Balerdroch is a really good boss monster and easily accessible as well.  This is the deck list for the deck.

Might have regional potential with the right format and pilot.,"The main point of this deck is to control your opponent by linking of their important materials and popping their cards before they are able to capitalize on them. The deck takes practice and requires you learn the balance of popping your own cards versus popping your opponent's cards. There are a lot of times where you intentionally die by battle just to proc effects and extend plays. This deck also has a lot of battle phase shenanigans with Rakea, Abominable, and Escape of the Unchained.  A few explanations:  Interrupted Kaiju Slumber: Dark Hole that gives both players Kaijus. Notably this allows you to use Unchained Soul of Disaster to link with the Kaiju given to your opponent. 4 Kaijus is a good ratio I believe. You can certainly run more, but I don't think the field spell is a great inclusion because it isn't searchable and doesn't always give you the value you would like. Opening Kaiju Slumber, any twin, and the field spell however can end on Soul of Rage backed by multiple negates, so if you can find a consistent way to do so, run wild with it.  Dark Spirit of Banishment/Malice: Self-recurring handtraps that summon your level 8 unchaineds out of grave, with Banishment also redirecting an attack in the process. Note that they negate the effect of the summoned monster so you can't then use Abominable to pop or Disaster to link off opponent's monsters, but if Disaster is destroyed his grave effect will still fire.  Witch's strike: Popping backrow against Unchained is just a bad idea. I'm doing that myself half the time anyway. This is a very nice power trap that blows out the opponent. Helps a lot in the Guru matchup. This can be replaced with any 3 cards of your choice.  The extra deck: You pretty much just need the Unchained links, the other stuff is really just utility. Unicorn is nice because you can make it on the opponent's turn to get that additional shuffle. BLS link is pretty easy to make with a level 7 or higher. Dingirsu allows you to handle things you can't normally. Borrelsword exists for the sole purpose of outing Ultimate Falcon, you typically don't OTK or when you are in a position where you could you're probably locked into summoning Fiends. Masterking is really only made when you have a Dark Spirit summoned off of Tour Guide you need to put in grave. There is so much flex space in this extra deck. Everything in here has come up once or twice at least, but there's probably better situational links/rank 8s."

Going first and going full combo will end on board with Borreload Savage Dragon at 4200ATK with 3 negates, a Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy and Hieratic Seal Of The Heavenly Spheres which will act as a disruption and tribute into Amorphage Goliath which will lock your opponent out of the Extra Deck(and yourself but stopping your opponent from doing anything is the strategy).

Depending on what turn you go can depend on how the deck plays. Going turn 1 its best to go into Ophion to lock out your opponent from any worth while synchro plays and just setting back row to negate any attempt to remove it whilst going second you can go into the more aggressive XYZ cards to try bust through your opponents board.  One main combo the deck has is with Phantom knights of break sword and steelswarm origin. By using break swords effect to destroy its self and origins SS effect you can go into 2 xyz monsters off the 2 effects and possibly go into the 2 utopic monsters if you choose to run them or go for a full lock down with Ophion and Redoer or Utopia. To do this you will need to special summon kerykeion off of Origins effect and then use kerykeions 2 effects to add one of the monsters used to link summon Origin (which will be both evilswarm) then normal summon it to your field, the 2 monsters brought back by break sword will both be level 4 so by doing this you can go into 2 xyz off of this combo."

Better to go second deck.  Best starting hand would be: 1 Rescue Rabbit, 1 G.B. Comeback, and the third and possibly a neccessary fourth card can be a few different card(s), but your first main goal is to get Test Panther and one Gladiator Beast on the field, along with having two other Gladiator Beasts that are in your hand and/or your GY with the GY being more preferable.  The best way to OTK:  Use a rescue animal to get two Andal's/Samnite's on your field and either use double summon, instant fusion an Essedarii/Thousand Keys (Definitely the least preferable option.  You'll understand why later.), Unexpected Dai an Andal (before the rescue animal), etc. to get three monsters total on the field.  If you used Rescue Rabbit and get just one Andal in your hand as well, you can link summon Link Spider with one of the Rabbit's Andal's and then use Link Spider's ability to Special Summon the Andal in your hand.  There are quite a few possible ways to do this, some scenarios can even get four or more monsters on your side of the field before the next step, but if you have enough Gladiator Beast monsters in your hand to pull off the next few steps efficiently, the best option is to use Mind Control on an opponent's monster and use it to link summon in the next step.  Your first goal is to link summon Test Panther with two of your three monsters and have one G. Beast leftover on the field.  So, if one of your three monsters isn't a Gladiator Beast, make sure you use it in the link summon.  Once you link summon Test Panther, you can add G.B. United to your hand from the deck.  When using the other ability of Test Panther, swap out the Gladiator Beast on the field with Test Pather, with Attorix from your deck and use its ability to send an Augustus to the GY from your deck.  By doing this, Attorix is considered Augustus in both name and level for the rest of the turn.  If you have G.B. Comeback, use it to special summon the Augustus in the GY to the field (This step can, if possible, can be done anytime before the battle phase).  Then special summon Andabata with G.B. United.  For the three monsters you use, if you can special summon Augustus from the GY with G.B. Comeback, use the Attorix that had it's named changed when you sent Augustus to the GY as a substitute for Augustus, and leave Augustus on the field.  And then use two other monsters, besides Augustus, from your GY, field, and/or hand, preferably the GY.  If you can't special summon Augustus from the GY, leave Attorix on the field when special summoning Andabata.  Do not use both the Attorix on the field and Augustus, if possible, when using the G.B. United.  Andabata can special summon Gyzarus who can then destroy 2 cards on the field.  Destroy all your opponents monsters with this ability if you can.  Next, use Andabata and Gyzarus to contact fuse and summon Tamer Editor.  Tamer Editor can then special summon another fusion Gladiator Beast, so pick either Heraklinos or Domitianus.  If there aren't any monsters on your opponent's field by this point, Heraklinos is preferable to destroy any possible spells/traps, and if you can get Augustus on the field, you'll have exactly 8000 attack points between Augustus, Tamer Editor, and Heraklinos.  Keep in mind, because of G.B. United, Test Panther can't attack the turn you use it.  (If you have Instant Fusion in your hand when you summon Tamer Editor, you can have Tamer Editor special summon Gyzarus instead, destroy two more of your opponent's cards, and then you can use Instant Fusion to special summon Essedarii.  Gyzarus and Essedarii can contact fusion into your second Tamer Editor and use it to special summon a Heraklinos or Domitianus.  A great alternate if you don't have Comeback.)  If everything goes right you'll have 8000+ attack points between all your monsters by the time you enter your battle phase, and hopefully no monsters on your opponent's field, so you can OTK.  And if that's not possible, you have many options to hold your own.  There are other slightly altered ways to do it besides what was just stated.  For example, if you get 1 Augustus in your hand at the start, instead of Attorix, you can use Test Panther to special summon the Augustus in your deck, who can then special summon the Augustus in your hand to the field.  I would only do this if you don't have G.B. Comeback, because if you go the Heraklinos route, you'll want to have as many cards in your hand as you can spare.  If you get the optimal hand, and there are more than a few different combinations to accomplish it in this deck's setup, you can OTK your opponent if you go second.  And between the main and extra deck, the only card in this deck that is selling for more than $4 is Evenly Matched, which many could do without.  This deck isn't very expensive considering how effective it is."

Nowe we activate ""black fang magician"" in pendulum zone. We use ""duelist alliance"" and we add "" Pendulum Call"". We use "" Pendulum Call"" we discard ""supreme king gate zero"" and add ""Oafdragon Magician"" and ""harmonizing magician"". We activate ""Oafdragon Magician"" in second pendulum zone. Nowe we pendulum summon 2 ""harmonizing magician"" and we use effect one of them. We SS ""black fang magician"" from deck. On 1 ""harmonizing magician"" and ""black fang magician"" we SS ""crystron needlefiber"" from extra deck and  we use his effect we SS ""jet synchron"". On ""crystron needlefiber"" we SS ""linkross"" we use his effect SS 2 tokens. ON 1 token and ""jet synchron"" we SS ""formula synchron"" we draw 1 card. Nowe on ""formula synchron"" and token we SS ""tin musical battlemech"" and we use his effect we SS ""formula synchron"" from GY. On ""linkross"" and ""formula synchron"" we SS ""predaplant verte anaconda"". On ""supreme king dragon darkwurm"" and ""harmonizing magician"" we SS ""union carrier"".

On ""tin musical battlemech"" and ""jet synchron"" we SS ""I:P Masquerena"". Nowe we use ""Oafdragon Magician"" effect in pendulum zone and we add ""harmonizing magician"" to hand. Finally we use ""predaplant verte anaconda"" and we SS ""dragun of red eyes"". In the next turn we use ""I:P Masquerena"" effect  on ""I:P Masquerena"" and ""union carrier"" we SS ""mekk knight crusadia avramax"". In the next turn more Dragun and what you need :)  Pay attention to this: if enemy will destroy our ""dragun of red eyes"" we can simply resurrect him. We can activate ""black fang magician"" in pendulum zone and reduce the attack one opponent's monster then we can SS ""dragun of red eyes"" from GY. Small synergy but enjoys ;)  For the introduction of this archetyp in 2020 year asked me one of the users of this page. I tried to change as little as possible from old deck list, but modern ygo is guided by its own laws. I hope you like it. This is not the final form of this deck yet, but thanks to this you can do it yourself or wait for update.  Side deck is just an example of what can be useful.  &nbsp;"

Card advantage is how TYZ is able to get a leg up on other decks and overwhelm them Non-effect monsters and synchros. The main play of the deck is to use one of the 3 one card starters (Souleating Oviraptor, Draconnet, Mathematican) to synchro summon Denglong and search Nine Pillars (Pro tip don't set backrow until you search Nine Pillars to ensure your opponent doesn't know where you set it). Then afterwords, use Denglong's effect to send a Tenyi from deck to GY (the best one to send, most of the time, is Ashuna) (BTW the level change isn't that important). Then on the opponent's turn negate something with Pillars and off of denlong being sent to GY summon Bi'an, then you revive Denlong with either Buddy Force or Back to the Front, use denlong to search Yang Zing Path (for card advantage), and when you see an opportunity use Bi'an to synchro with Denlong into Baxia and shuffle 2 cards on the opponent's field (Pro tip don't chain Bi'an to a card effect because if you do Baxia will miss timing, also Bi'an gives Baxia battle protection). That's the main bread and butter combo of the Deck that's a +2 in card advantage and gives you a way to recycle the Yang Zings (and draw 2) and puts a Tenyi in the GY. Trinitys: Trap Trick &amp; Draco Masters, Denglong &amp; Vessel, and Nine Pillars"

It's about as field-nukey as field nuking can get. The original Demise is not once per turn, so you can keep blowing the field up if your opponents has floaters, as long as you have the life points. Big Demise is a nuke with no cost most of the time. Ruin is okay, she's mainly there for OTKing, especially the big one. It is a ritual deck, so it's about as consistent as any deck can get (that's a joke, by the way. Rituals have never been consistent without being broken, look at Gishki and Nekroz). The two normal monsters are there for Advanced Ritual Art. Since there's no real way to summon them, I just picked two that I like. There's no extra deck, because this deck doesn't really keep up enough field presence to have one. It's an absolute blast to play, because who doesn't like blowing up a field your opponent spent five minutes making?"

It is a beatdown,"Hello,  I have been playing Ancient Warriors since they were released in IGAS and have put many hours in to playing them in locals and online games. This is what I believe to be the most consistent way to play the deck at the moment.  I will do a basic overview on the main goal of the deck - you very much have to play with the hand you get and work out which path is the best to take. It can struggle going first but as most decks do, it you get the right cards you will be able to set up a bit of a headache for your opponent.  So it is a blind second deck with the focus on getting multiple AW's on the field. Three Visits is the card you want to see in your hand every time as this really allows you to play. Going second this combined with Loyal Guan Yun gets you a beater with a pop on to the field and the ability to search for another AW.  If you are still outnumbered by the opponent Virtuous Liu Xuan will gain you further advantage by being able to special summon out another AW - usually this will be Masterful Sun Mou.  Sun Mou in my opinion is the best monster in this deck. His search ability sends as cost so combined with Three Visits and an AW in hand, even if you dont get to search you should get the special summon. More often than not off Sun Mou's search you will be adding Valiant Zhang De as by this point you should have 2 AW's on field to make use of his ss ability.  Zhang De summon can be used to trigger Sun Mou's bounce effect which really starts giving some pressure. Speaking of Mou's bounce effect, in the battle phase with Liu Xuan in play, you can attack with Mou to trigger Xuan, draw 1, then trigger Mou to bounce before the attack goes through (if you haven't already bounced this turn).  Graceful Zhou Gong is ok. He is very situational but does allow the deck to OTK by using his search effect to get Ancient Warrior Saga - Sun-Liu Alliance to hand. If you are taking this route you will have most likely gone second and be out numbered by your opponent and either special summoned it with Xuan or by popping Three visits to special summon it from hand. I never find it worth while to normal summon him unless you have Three Visits and need the search for a second AW.  With Gong and hopefully 2 other AW's on field you will be able special summon Zhang De to trigger some effects including Alliance which will give them all a 1200 atk boost and should give the OTK.  &nbsp;  The Draco engine in this deck really gives it the consistency it needs and the ability to cause more problems to the opponent. Not only does it have great synergy with the AW's ability to send cards to the graveyard, the added backrow and monster removal its a great equaliser and the search from Heritage and Disciples comes up more than you would expect. Also being able to summon Dinomight and Ignis on your opponents turn and pop a monster with Apocalypse is very handy.  Nibiru and Gameciel are musts in most going second decks and with the amount of combo and break my board decks they are really handy. A great interaction between Sun Mou and Gameciel is that you can use Gameciel to tribute a troublesome card, Mou effect to bounce it back to hand and then use Gameciel once more to get rid of a second card.  Metaverse and Mystic Mine are insanely helpful especially when you are waiting on one more piece to allow you to push for game. With many cards in deck that will allow you to get rid of your own mine, it is just an added level of protection incase you dont get the cards you needed.  Many decks you will see will run Fire Formation - Tensu for the extra normal summon, personally i found this card to be a brick / do nothing card most of the time so chose to run Gyokkou instead. The ability to shut down a backrow spot and force your opponent to use resorces to deal with it is insane and when anti spell is sided in you can lock down important combo starters ect. I know this is a point people will disagree with me on, but if you feel strongly about it then you can always side it for going first, however it is a brick when you cant use it.  I hope this helps anyway, once the new support comes out a pure version might be more conisitent and powerful than this, but I will continue to play test and deck build and hopefully will post another one once the cards are released and I have had time to play with it all."

Broken control, broken recovery, broken general support, broken generic cards... This deck is by far one of the most degenerate and evil decks I have ever played. It was only a matter of time before people figured out how to secure this deck a spot in the meta... and it turns out that embracing the fact Eldlich is a trap deck is the way to do it. After studying and mastering this not so difficult to play deck, I have realized just how easy and fun it is to watch your opponent squirm and rage trying to get rid of the incredible recursion offered by this archetype's spells and traps. The fact that this deck doesn't require a normal summon adds further insult to injury in the fact that you can run 3 more mini-skill drains in the form of inspector boarder, which also happens to have 2000 attack which can come in handy when you're grinding your opponent into submission, oh by the way, did I mention the deck doesn't require a normal summon? Because going second you can just side in lava golems and sphere modes and let your opponent kiss their 30 minute board setup goodbye.  P.S. This deck is reallllllyyyy easy to play, but if you can't figure it out on your own feel free to reply and I'll see what I can do or like this post and give me clout and I might make a tutorial video. (It might be pretty boring and short considering this isn't exactly a combo deck)"

With that combo alive, it makes Valkyr","Should this site change to EDOPRODECK? Hmm. Anyway the recent EDOPRO (previously YGOPRO Percy) simulator now can work with Mischief of the Time Goddess, making playtesting full power Valkyrie with future/prereleased cards possible. Basic combo is to OTK your opponent using Time Goddess (double battle phase) or Borrelsword Dragon for easier setup. Going first, we can make Apollousa or True King of All Calamities from Diviner of the Heralds. The combo is normal summon Diviner, dump Trias Hierarchia, use Trias tribute Diviner ss Trias, use Diviner ss Sechste, use Sechste ss Sigrun, overlay Trias and Sigrun for True King of All Calamities.  The Valkyrie cards ratio is medium because most of them are not too good, only some you wanna see the most, also we dont rely on Ride of the Valkyries that much as it makes our monsters shuffled to the deck going first (doesnt even worth the no damage taken for 2 turns). One copy of Time Goddess because its searchable and mostly a dead card (we can OTK with Borrelsword anyway).  The supports: Hecatrice + Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen (free fairy, triggers our Sechste too), Galaxy Cyclone and Night Beam (backrow pops, work with Vierte as both are normal spell, similar to D-Hero Diamond Dude but faster), One for One (for Sechste, Vierte target), Raigeki and Herald of the Abyss (monster pops, Vierte target, we didnt play Lightning Storm as it conflicts with Valhalla), double Dark Ruler No More (only 2 cus while we can do 2 battle phase, this card makes us unable to OTK cus no damage on first battle phase), Reasoning (mainly for Sechste, our Valkyries have different level too), Pots (can be Desires, Extrav, or anything, Valkyrie deck needs so many draw/search cards as much as possible), Monster Reborn and World Legacy Succession (extender, possibly triggering our Valkyries from GY), Tuner's High (Diviner searcher by using Sechste as fodder). Can put Utopia Double if you want but it will be very dependent on our hand.  Extra deck: We're using Extravagance, means multiple copies of our important cards.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/txgCsBr.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Going first is much stronger than previous build, have multiple ways of OTK (more if with Utopia Double), bunch of removal/breaking board cards, can put in handtraps.  Cons: Only has Diviner as great starter (other ways we might need extenders), Ride of the Valkyries is very bad on first turn (it means drawing multiple Valkyries going first is kinda bricky sometimes).

You special summon the higher lvl (boss-)monsters/masters by tributing the low lvl students in addition of discarding a spellcard. They cost seems to be high, but don't worry, the discarded spellcards, you haven't activated the same turn, will come back from the graveyard to your hand or direct on the field. You also have multiple layer of protection, negation- and destruction- effect, removal and recovery options.  This specific profile don't use ""Pod of Extravagance"" and ""Magician's Souls"" wich other build prefers, cause of budget reasons. The Deck performce very well without them and have a good consistentcy by it self. Beside the already mentioned spellcard recycling mechanic, i built in much drawcards. Together with ""Spell Chonicle"" and the new trap ""Witchcrafter Patronus"" you can generate a big card advantage, especially in the lategame."

It does have a slight inconsistency issue in that you dont so much get to search the cards you want but excavate them which can be a tad unreliable which is why I can't label this a tier 1 deck. You want to run a lot of rock monsters to really maximize your chances of excavating a rock monster. The extra deck is diverse to pile on negations, can perform hand loops, and can even lock your opponent out of special summoning on their turn. Really I think this deck is undervalued and overshadowed by Eldlich atm. This deck is a really strong rogue/tier 2 option for this format."

Crusadia equimax is also a win condition because you can use it to OTK, simply using an infernoid monster to tribute it in battle phase, after you attaced with it.  Lair of darkness is really helpfull, both with infernoid monsters and monster gate, which is really good to out your opponesnt's monsters and mill some cards.  For the hand traps I run gammas and impermanences. Evenly matched is the only trap.  If you lose game 1 and you think your opponent is going to let you going first, it is a good idea to side the other two void feasts, which are great to activate in your opponent's draw phase/standby phase to set two negations on the field.  Void imagination is, of course, the strongest card in the deck. You always want to resolve it because you can mill three elder entitys with tierra to pop three cards and you send a lot of infernoids to gy as materials. However you have to side them out, maybe for void feasts, against decks that don't use the extra deck."

I played Shaddoll Hero ABC Chaos. I wanted to play Shaddoll Heroes this month cause the deck seemed broken. I hadn't played trinity in a bit but, luckily my friend, Anim7ed, had an amazing list that he gave me.  What tech choices did you play? Two tweaks I made to Anim7ed's deck were to add in Danger! Bigfoot and Abominable Unchained Soul. Danger! Bigfoot worked out pretty well since this deck has a lot of discard and Bigfoot often was the best discard since you get to destroy a card. Abominable Unchained was amazing. He was easy to summon and whenever he was summoned, he swung the game in my favor.  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward? I did not prep for the meta but, the deck made by Anim7ed was so strong that it plowed through other decks. There are two things I would change about the deck. The first change is I would add more chaos elements to the deck to which would trigger Eclipse Wyvern more. The second change would be to take out the equip sub-theme. The only good equip in the deck was premature burial and it wasn't good enough to warrant 2 bad equips and 2 equip searchers.  How were your matchups?  The insane value that the deck generated beat most decks. The two decks I struggled with were Mika's Zoodiacs and KrasherV's Spyrals. Mika's Zoos banished a lot of my cards with Whiptail's effect which hurt my recursion and had a lot of disruption. KrasherV's Spyrals establishes threats early and then ends the game when he sets up Sleeper + Last Resort which never leaves room for the dawdling of my deck."

I played a variant of Traptrix i call Synchro Traptrix, i played it due to my liking of the Traptrix playstyle with its high consistency and access to powerful trap holes and advantage loops with Sera. However, i felt the deck lacked a strong finisher and method to pressure the opponent so i added several 1 card synchro and XYZ engines, like Oviraptor and Assault to summon strong boss monsters.  What tech choices did you play?  The Lefty and Righty Driver package to make Herald of the Arc Light, Red Blossoms from Underroot and Treacherous Trap Hole were my main tech choices  How did you prepare for the meta, and would you change anything going forward?  I prepared by including a range of tech options strong against meta decks such as the above techs to counter Hero Shaddoll by preventing Shaddoll Fusion or Vyon by banishing cards or by banishing shaddoll fusion or a fusion monster by Blossom, plus Treacherous to serve as a powerful turn 1 option to blow up unprepared boards. I would definitely cut the Drivers, they felt very underpowered with Arc Light being too small to stop the opponent simply running it over before committing, and reallocate some traps to include new cards such as Snowflower Sheet.  How were your matchups? A had a range of good and bad matchups, most notably Unchained which i could counter with the wide assortment of GY hate and banishing methods to limit their recursion, however, i eventually got knocked out by the winning Spyral deck where i was unable to deal with the constant destruction a Sleeper offered. However, even in bad matchups, i could grab wins through Utopia Double granting me some wins i very much did not deserve. Also please send us your decklist"

This deck is pretty consistent as most of the cards search each other and can summon Raviel in many ways. Dark Beckoning Beast plus ""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"" is a two card combo that will end on Raviel on field with Fallen Paradise as well as a link-2. Pentestag for piercing, and Knightmare phoenix for board clearing.  Phantom Skyblaster plus any special summoned monster will get you a Saryuja Skulldread which will allow you to extend even further.  <strong>Card Choice</strong>  Card choice is highly interchangeable, in order to fit the current meta.  The most notable ""upgrade"" would be replacing Twin Twisters with Lightning Storm adding more versatility to clearing boards while going second.  This deck suffers pretty greatly from hand traps/Search negates. The evil hero isn't the most useful card in the deck and the spells are searchable you can consider cutting 1 of the field spell as well as the Seven Gates to add in 3 Called by the grave if you're worried about getting hit with disruption. Alternatively you could replace one of the evil hero's with a Danger!? Jackalope? for some more consistency.  The danger package here seems odd at first glance, but it is meant to give more fiend materials on board as well as add draw power to the deck. Nessie! will allow you to add a Chupacabra to hand if it is hit with its own effect. Additionally, adding jackalope will allow you to summon a Chupacabra from deck if you wish to add that as well.  Super Polymerization is essential for clearing opponents monsters that will prevent you from searching or using other card effects. That along with Predaplant Dragostepalia clears The Mechaba Winda Lock with ease. This is also run with 2 Starving venom fusion dragon to help clear the abundance of dark monsters in the game.  &nbsp;  <strong>Side Deck</strong>  The side deck has been construced for going first in game 2 or 3 in matches Since Hamon uses essentially the same engine as Raviel, you can switch up your strategy to a control variant on the fly. If you choose to, you can also use the sacred beast trap card that works as a one sided skill drain if you have 2 different beasts on the field, however this can be a little less consistent to pull off so I opted for solemn judgement instead. Artifact package should also be able to shut down most opponents who attempt to break your board using the extra deck.  Note* This side deck is totally optional, removing The Hamon package can make your side deck more potent for specific threats in the meta."

When going first, it has access to half the combo of the Infinite Negates build (Simorgh, Infinity, Apex Avian) which makes a very good 2-Negate 1st turn board.  It is fairly consistent and its easy access to Black Whirldwind and Allure of Darkness helps the situation a lot.  The Deck rarely bricks, but when it does it's an instant loss (the majority of the times).  And it's fragile playstyle does not help either when the player draws bad hands.  Overall, the deck is extremely fun to play but besides the most versatile build, it is definitely not a top contender.  &nbsp;  If you want to see what the deck can do in action, check out the video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXqjVQu53Ws&amp;t=712s"

Welcome to Hamon Control. This deck will be based on the new support in the sacred beast structure deck coming to the tcg on July 10, 2020.  &nbsp;  This deck aims to go first and set up Hamon and Raviel with the field spell and New trap card that works as a One sided skill drain! (This is an early build and can still likely be made more consistent)  The new ""Dark Beckoning Beast"" is your bread and butter! Seeing that plus any other of your summoning beasts OR the New search spell ""Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed""  is a two card combo that will end you on both Sacred Beasts and the field spell at the very least, meaning you will often have 3 other cards in your hand plus a draw 2 to continue your plays.  If you want more consistency over stun capability you can try removing the artifact engine and adding in a few more dangers, as well as foolish burial goods to the deck. Personally, I add level 8 dangers so I can also utilize Trade-in. Foolish burial goods is used to send your ""Cerulean Skyfire"" to the grave so that Your searcher can bring it back to hand.  When being forced to go second in games 2 and 3 it may be wise to drop the artifact package as well as the solemns for some more board clearing capabilities. Evenly Matched, Lightning Storm, and Super Polymerization are your big equalizers. Despite having to give up your battle-phase to resolve evenly matched it will more often than not result in you being able to build a full board while making it almost impossible for your opponent to recur those banished cards. As a reminder for going second, after activating dark summoning beast's ability to summon from hand/deck you will not be able to attack for the rest of the turn. However, if you are able to mount a board presence you may still use your battle phase <strong>Before</strong> you use this effect.  Since all of the cards in the archetype are searchable it may not be necessary to have them run at 3, however they can be easily disrupted by the likes of Infinite impermanence and other hand traps, so be weary and bring along some called by the graves if you find it too troublesome.  Good Luck, and have fun!"

For these reasons I am not writing the combo step by step, it would be useless, if you want a visual proof as an example, look at the video you find just above the decklist.</em></p> <strong>The Beginning:</strong> <p>With the new additions, the combo start is very similar to a Dragon Link deck, subsequently our intent is to summon the Guardragon and then <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>, after that our aim is to summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> (doesn't necessarily have to be summoned at this very moment) to send cards to the graveyard and add a light/dark in hand.</p> <p>We summon <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> 2 times (sometimes only 1 is enough) to draw cards, and in the meantime send as many cards as possible to the graveyard. This is the preparation for the final board which varies according to the cards in hand and the graveyard.</p> <strong>Final Board:</strong> <p>Usually with the second <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> I like to summon <a data-name=""Lumina, Twilightsworn Shaman"">Lumina, Twilightsworn Shaman</a> from the hand while continuing with it. If you have enough monsters you could adopt to summon <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> in addition to the other usual negate.</p> <p>Make sure you have <a data-name=""Galactic Spiral Dragon"">Galactic Spiral Dragon</a> at the graveyard to summon Monster rank 8.</p> <p><em><strong>Usually the final board is:</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>, <a data-name=""Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord"">Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord + </a><a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</a> or <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>.</strong></em></p>   <hr />  <em><strong>Tips and Tricks:</strong></em>  Initially if you can start with the dragon link combo, try not to send too many cards to the graveyard from Lightsworn effects so as not to risk sending to the gy cards we need to complete the combo, fill the graveyard then that, be careful not to remove too many cards from the game, there must always be several monsters in the graveyard.  If you need a monster in your hand but you haven't drawn it so far, you can summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> to try to find it among those 5 cards.  If we have <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a> and Absorouter Dragon in hand we can discard it by cost, triggering its effect, to add <a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</a><a data-name=""Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended"">,</a> <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a><a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon""> or </a><a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a> in hand.  <a data-name=""Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon"">Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon</a> is essential to recover the removed cards, especially when they are banned from <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>. <table>  <tr> <td><strong>CONSIDERATIONS</strong></td> </tr>  </table> <strong>The Deck:</strong>  As much as it is a particular deck it's quite balanced, even when you have bad hands, you still manage to get away with it.  The deck if it's not interrupted by negations really manages to put the opponent in difficulty, but we know it's almost impossible. Well, if it manages to send cards to the graveyard even with negations, this deck doesn't have too many problems to go on.  Since the deck sends many cards to the graveyard it's not safe to play many spells,also because those spells in the gy have no use, instead you need light and dark monsters to be removed from the game, to summon our dragons from the hand.  <strong>The Cards</strong>: <ul>  	<li>Lightsworn's cards are fundamental to send as many cards to the graveyard as possible and thanks to <a data-name=""Solar Recharge"">Solar Recharge</a> we can also draw 2 cards  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>, maybe is the best card of the deck, manages to give the deck a lot of stability, ensuring that you have some main cards in your hand, as well as letting you discard a card and then draw another.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Lightpulsar Dragon"">Lightpulsar Dragon</a> is very important not only to summon Chaos Ruler with the help of <a data-name=""Plaguespreader zombie"">Plaguespreader zombie</a> and <a data-name=""Galaxy Serpent"">Galaxy Serpent</a> ,but with this card u and you can take advantage of its 3 effects.You can easily summon it and use it to send cards to the graveyard ,moreover you can Summon <a data-name=""Hieratic Dragon King of Atum"">Hieratic Dragon King of Atum</a>.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>, it's an excellent card because you can search for practically all the dragons you need, and when it is in your Gy u can banish it to add to your hand <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> or <a data-name=""Chaos Emperor, The Dragon of Armageddon"">Chaos Emperor, The Dragon of Armageddon</a>.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, this is a really good card, i normally use it to destroy 2 cards on the field and above all to special summon Monsters from the graveyard like <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Noctovision Dragon"">Noctovision Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Omni Dragon Brotaur"">Omni Dragon Brotaur</a> or 1 of 3 tuner Monsters. If u start for first u can use it to shuffle 1 card from your opponent's hand into the deck.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Demonic Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Demonic Dragon</a>, The new support that has improved the deck a lot. Even if the first thing to do is to fill the graveyard, try to summon it after the main combo or in any case after having already a good number of cards in the graveyard. The card is not difficult to summon and when it drops on the field in addition to sending cards to the gy it allows you to choose one of those monsters and add it to your hand. Also when you recall it from the gy with its own effect, use it to summon a rank 8 xyz.</li> </ul>  <hr /> <p><span><em>So... Have you to start for first or for second?</em></span></p> You can do both very well, obviously having cards with a high attack value is could start for seconds, but you are more likely to be annoyed by your opponent. And if you start first you can play the part of the annoying opponent. Usually is better start for first in this meta. <table>  <tr> <td><span>SIDE DECK</span></td> </tr>  </table> <p><b>Must Have:</b></p> <a data-name=""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju"">Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju</a> is the only dark Kaiju monster can be used. Its use is obviously very basic, you can easily get rid of an opposing monster, as well as summon it if there is already a Kaiju on the opposing field. We usually prefer its against decks that have 1 major monster boss, like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.  or  <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> it's a really strong card against combo decks, if he can't get negation before 5 summon, our opponent most of the time, will pass the turn immediately after.  <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> is a really strong ht in this meta, it hurts Dino, Invoked, Virtual World, Eldlich, Dragon Link, Infernoble Knight and other . It is also light, which is important.  <a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> is excellent because in addition to <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>, the deck has difficulty breaking opposing spells or traps, and the effect is also activated from the graveyard. It also has a beautiful interaction with <a data-name=""Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord"">Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</a> which, through its effect in the opponent's turn, allows us to choose a Galaxy card from the deck and add it in hand or attach it as material to it.  <a data-name=""World Legacy Guardragon"">World Legacy Guardragon</a> we use it to go first having more stability, especially if we are afraid of a possible opponent's <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> ,with this card we can advance the combo a minimum, without having to ban cards.  <hr /> <p><b>Other cards that may be useful:</b></p> <a data-name=""Denko Sekka"">Denko Sekka</a> together with <a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> helps us against control decks, in fact if we manage to summon it our opponent will not be able to set cards nor activete s/t that are set on the field. Let's try to protect it with cards like <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> or <a data-name=""Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres"">Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres.</a>  <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> is an excellent card that allows us, to return resources to the deck as well as to draw 2 cards. It can be played in a version of the deck, that doesn't focus too much on the otk but tries to play for more turns.  <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</a> is an excellent beatdown monster, that is easily summoned even by using most of the high level to make it not targetable. <p>-</p>  <table>  <tr> <td><span>DISCORD</span></td> </tr>  </table> <p><a>https://discord.gg/tct2cZZ</a></p>   <hr />  - UPDATE  <em>update 2.0 -&gt; <b>Added Cards</b></em>: <a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a>, <a data-name=""The Chaos Creator"">The Chaos Creator</a>, <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Samsara Dragon"">Samsara Dragon</a>. / <b>Removed Cards</b>: <a data-name=""Danger!

If the TCG banlist now unbanned Snow and Grass, LIGHTSWORN easily would wreck the M","<blockquote><div>The Lightsworns are a group who seek to save those who pray for help, crossing time and space in order to help them. By consuming vast quantities of magical energy, they appear on the material plane and challenge those evildoers who threaten the era they appear in. Once their job is done and the evil has been stopped, they return to their home plane, disappearing without a trace.  Their founder, <em>Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn</em>, is responsible for enlisting the souls of heroes worthy of joining the Lightsworns. As they travel in order to fight evil, they also recruit the heroes of that time.</div></blockquote> Resource: <i>Lore </i>-&gt; <em><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygorganization.com/geargia-lightsworn-lore/"">https://ygorganization.com/geargia-lightsworn-lore/</a></em>  &nbsp;  <strong>Lightsworn: The Deck's History And Strategy</strong>  Who hasn't heard of them before?  Lightsworn Decks aim to send cards from the top of the Deck to the Graveyard and then benefit from sending them there. All Lightsworn monsters (except <em>Wulf, Jenis and Rinyan</em>) mill cards from the top of the Deck to pay the cost for skills or as a requirement at the End Phase. Their monster's effects trigger by either being sent to the graveyard or sending cards to the graveyard - so their GY can basically be seen as their second hand.  The usage of Spells and Traps vary in Lightsworn; many play the 'main starter' spells like<em> Solar Recharge</em> (Discard 1 ''Lightsworn'' monster; draw 2 cards, then send the top 2 cards of your Deck to the GY) and <em>Charge Of The Light</em> Brigade (Send the top 3 cards of your Deck to the GY; add one 4-✰ ''Lightsworn'' monster from your Deck to your hand) - other builds integrate the trap <em>Lightsworn Judgment</em>, which acts as a searcher for <em>Judgment Dragon</em>. <blockquote><div>The success of the Lightsworn-Decks can be traced back to many different time periods and took many different forms.</div></blockquote> Back then, Chaos-Lightsworn and <em>That Grass Looks Greener</em>-Turbo-Milling-Decks completely wrecked the meta (despite bricking every second game) with <em>Judgement Dragon</em> being an easily-summoned monster with integretated spot removal (paying 1000 Life Points to destroy all other cards on the field) and high ATK. They synergize with many other archetypes; (Chaos, Twilightsworn, Shaddolls, Lighttray, Dinosaurs, Dragons, e.t.c.) making them capable of uniting all attributes and a lot of different monster types. <blockquote><div>In the history of YGO, The Lightsworn have been hit badly many times - examples of that being the bans of <em>Fairy Tail - Snow, Black Dragon Collapserpent, Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson, Glow-Up-Bulb, That Grass Looks Greener, Soul Charge, Brilliant Fusion,</em> and <em>Sixth Sense, e.t.c. </em></div></blockquote> While the TCG-banlist still holds the Lightsworn-players back, the OCG slowly integrated some of Lightsworn's keycards back into the game. Finally, <em>Snow</em> has been unbanned in the recent banlist (OCG, 2020.04) and <em>That Grass Looks Greener</em> is now semi-limited.  Lightsworn lately haven't seen a lot of competetive play though, due to their vulnerability to negating effects - and undeniablely, this is the current meta's top priority. <blockquote><div>To summarise: With great risk often comes great reward.</div></blockquote> Lightsworn Decks are capable of a very fast OTK - so they easily can push for game with their powerful Boss Monsters - and going through your whole Extra Deck, (in this deck version mainly Synchro-cards like <em>Borreload Savage Dragon</em> or <em>F.A. Dawn Dragster</em> with negating capabilities).  There are failures, setbacks and even complete start-over's along the way; decking out could be a problem for Lightsworns due to milling being your main mechanism. Additionally, Lightsworn Decks rely (sometimes) on the heart of card's (imagine the feeling of bricking with three copies of <em>Wulf, Lightsworn Beast</em> in your starting hand) and are vulnerable to negating effects such as <em>Skill Drain</em>.  &nbsp;  <strong>An Explanation Of The Card Ratios - (TCG-version)</strong>  Here I'll explain why I chose certain card ratios and how I use them. In this variant, you have a Dragon- and Shaddoll-engine, combined with some Dangers; improving the draw power (bricking in Lightsworn sucks, sometimes resulting in an immediate game loss) and consistency. Sometimes, the Shaddoll-Fusion-Cards (<em>El Shaddoll Winda</em>) rescue your life going first, limiting your opponent's special summons.  First, let's look at the most obvious part: The Lightsworn Monsters. <ul>  	<li><em>3x Wulf, 3x Raiden, 2x Lumina, 1x Felis, 1x Garoth, 1x Lyla, 1x Minerva, 1x Judgment Dragon</em></li> </ul> <em>Raiden</em> and <em>Lumina</em> are the most powerful of the monsters named above: <em>Raiden</em> is a 4-✰ Tuner, milling up to twice per turn and enabling synchro plays. <em>Lumina</em> discards one card in your hand and let's you special summon another Lightsworn in your GY, preferably <em>Raiden</em> to use his milling effect, (or an additional copy of <em>Lumina</em> to revive another Lightsworn monster - it's not a hard once per turn effect).  That's why commonly players play both cards at 3. I agree with <em>Raiden</em> being at his highest ratio, because he's our common normal summon, starts combo-plays, and we want t0 see him as often as possible in our starting hand. If we would put <em>Lumina</em> at the same ratio, there's a problem with 'wasting' a normal summon for her and not milling anything in our Main Phase with her effect. We can search her via <em>Charge Of Light Brigade</em> as well, so she's okay at 2 copies.  The Lightsworn cards we want to mill are <em>Wulf, Felis</em> and <em>Minerva</em>. <em>Wulf </em>is a 2,1K Beatstick without ability to mill, and is special summoned if it's sent from your Deck to your GY - an unquestionable 3-of. 'A 4th copy of <em>Wulf</em>', you could say, is <em>Felis</em>. She's a 4-✰ Tuner and special summoned when sent from the Deck to the GY by a monster effect. The last restriction sucks, (that's why I only play one copy), but her spot removal and milling effect outweighs the bad. Both cards can help you go into Synchro, XYZ- and Link-monsters.  One card, which rarely sees play in Lightsworn Engines is <em>Minerva</em>. She is a 3-✰ Tuner, who adds you 1 Light Dragon Monster from your Deck to your hand, (whose Level is less than or equal to the toal number of Lightsworn monsters with different names in your GY), when normal summoned. I understand why <em>Minerva</em> doesn't see a lot of play: <em>Minerva's</em> effect requires you to normal summon her and play a lot of Lightsworn monsters (and them to be in the GY)- and she only mills 2 cards at your End Phase. But her additional effect (...If this card is sent from the hand or Deck to the Graveyard: Send the top card of your Deck to the Graveyard ...) helps us mill faster and she helps us with bringing out our <em>Judgment Dragon. </em><em>Garoth</em>, <em>Lyla</em> and <em>Judgment Dragon</em> are solid monsters, but I only play each of them at 1 copy to avoid bricking. <ul>  	<li><em>2x Shaddoll Beast, 2x Dragon, 2x Hedhehog, 2x Falco, 1x Squamata, 1x Reeshaddoll Wendi</em></li> </ul> The effects of the Lightsworn often trigger a variety of other archtepyes (like <em>Shaddoll</em> cards), but always be aware that milling as a cost does not trigger the Shaddoll cards! Except that, Shaddolls are best friends with Lightsworn (and Dangers). They are perfect targets for <em>Allure Of Darkness</em>, give us draw power, and restrict our opponent. Good thing to mention: Their monsters, traps and spells can be revived from the GY. <ul>  	<li>1x Wyverbuster, 1x Collapserpent, 2x Starliege Seyfert, 1x Omni Dragon Brotaur, 1x Levianeer</li> </ul> A Dragon-Engine, which enables more Extra-Deck plays, especially Links, and brings our beloved <em>Judgment Dragon</em> to our field. Especially <em>Seyfert</em> acts as decent normal summon and searcher, and can banish itself to add 1 Level 8 Light or Dark Dragon from our GY to our hand. Play them, it's worth the money.  The other monster cards in this Deck Build are Dangers, Handtraps (and <em>Gizmek Orochi</em>). One thing to mention about the spells that might surprise you is that I play<em> Solar Recharge</em> just at 2 copies. I don't play a lot of Lightsworn to justify it's highest ratio, and I am fine with using <em>Allure Of Darkness</em>.  <strong>Extra Spice / Deck Ideas</strong>  In the OCG, there's a card named <em>Chaos Ruler the Chaotic Demonic Dragon</em>. It's the BEST Synchro-monster for Lightsworn in a while, because it adds you 1 card to your hand and mills 4 cards. It can revive itself via banishing one Light or Dark monster from your hand or GY - again a perfect opportunity to introduce the next card ...  <em>Nemesys Keystone.</em> Another interesting card to try would be <em>Nemesys Keystone</em> (OCG). It special summons itself from your hand when you shuffle back 1 of your banished monsters - and if this card gets banished, you can add this card to your hand. <em>Nemesys Keystone</em> would be AT LEAST a 1 of for sure.

Stick Jowgen with protection, or grind the game to a halt with Mystic Mine.","Spellbook deck for April 2020. The goal is to turbo Jowgen the Spiritualist to lock opponents out of special Summoning, equip him with battle protection from Power of the Guardians, and grind games to a halt.  There's a very small package of monsters, with the vast majority of the deck being spells. 3 Magicians' Souls serve as draw power, this deck is pretty good at taking advantage of Spellbooks in the GY, but more importantly, this lets you filter through cards you don't need to dig to your floodgates, which are how you win the game. You have the advantage of naturally wanting to run 1 High Priestess of Prophecy anyways, which you can send off of this and reanimate with Spellbook of Life. High Priestess is a beater with a half-decent removal. It's a good way to pop backrow and it gives you some sort of way to beat over bigger monsters your opponent might normal summon.  There are, of course, 3 Jowgen. Since you can't search this card, the goal is to dig for him. The deck has a lot of filtering and drawing that you can pull off all in one turn, and it's not unusual to see half of your deck in the first turn, meaning you have reasonably good odds of drawing him. His board wipe ability is icing that makes him less dead going second.  We've got a full playset of Blue Boy, Spellbook Magician of Prophecy. This card has the spellbook name, which is relevant for some spellbook effects, and also searches any of your spellbook cards. This can search for Secrets, and secrets can search for this, giving you a lot of deck thinning abilities. It does suck using your normal summon for him, since it locks you out of Jowgen for the turn, but the set up with this card is real and it's an obvious 3 of.  The deck runs several field spells. 2 copies of Mystic Mine are super clutch. Since this deck wins by grinding games to a halt, you have a good go second option when things are protected from Jowgen's field wipe ability. The deck also runs 2 Demise of the Land and 1 Metaverse, so you can drop Mystic Mine on your opponent after they've summoned their second monster to basically end their turn. Those searchers can also find out other field spells, 1 Secret Village of Spellcasters and 1 Grand Spellbook Tower. Secret Village of Spellcasters is super deadly against any deck reliant on spells, such as fusion decks (Shaddolls, HERO) or spell-spam decks (True Draco, Skystriker). You have to decide which floodgate is better, but having extra field spells to use to turn your Mine off is also helpful. The Spellbook Tower is... fine. It recycles Spellbook cards and can let you draw an extra card per turn, which is nice, especially for a grindy deck, but we've got better field spells in most matchups.  We've got a single copy of One Day of Peace and a single Upstart Goblin. One Day of Peace just gives you that one turn to set up, while also increasing the consistency of the deck, which Upstart is solely a small consistency boost. The deck is geared towards drawing 4 each turn with the spellbook combo, so the more card draw I could add to that the more consistently I could stick a Jowgen. The One Day of Peace has seriously impressed me, it really takes the pressure off and lets me use Blue Boy to search.  For spellbooks, We've got 3 Secrets, 3 Knowledge, and 2 Master. If you use Knowledge first and then the Master you can draw 4 - its also possible to use Blue Boy to find Secrets (or vice versa), find Master, search Knowledge, and then draw 2, getting an extra search out of it. This plus Magicians' Souls is the deck's bread and butter.  We've also got 2 copies of Spellbook of Eternity, to recycle our spellbooks (works sort of like a combo extender in the deck) and 3 copies of Spellbook of Fate. Spellbook of Fate banishes 1 card without targeting, which is its primary purpose, but I have on occasion used all 3 of its abilities. Good removal is good - using a quickplay spell to banish without targeting is unreal.  We also have the single copies of Spellbook of Life, which helps resurrect either Jowgen or High Priestess, and one copy of Spellbook of Power, which can be copied with Spellbook of the Master to give a creature 2000 Atk points. This can be crucial to help Jowgen beat over bigger normal summoned monsters while searching twice.  For the last maindeck slot we have 3 Solemn Judgement. Half of your life points is nothing compared to stopping that Lightning Storm or other key effect/creature that would out Jowgen.  In the extra deck we have... some stuff. We have every Super Poly target, including a couple weird ones I felt I had space for (super polying 2 Dark Dragons to make Furious might seem on the face of it weaker than Starving Venom, but I like the flexibility). Then we have 2 Crowley, which can work with Blue Boy and Souls to grab another spellbook. We have one of each Link 2 Knightmare for a spot of extra deck removal, and 1 Verte Anaconda to use Super Poly as extra deck removal.  The Side Deck are a bunch of options to break boards in different matchups, so that going second isn't a death sentence."

Two Sacred Beasts with their total of 8000 attack points are impeccable in terms of offense and defence. <em>Fallen Paradise</em> offers protection and card draw. Gathering all these cards on board can be achieved even in the first turn depending on your starting hand. I aimed to make it consistent as possible. Even partially completing this combo is pretty strong. If all fails, you can resort <strong><em>Armityle the Chaos Phantom </em></strong>to deal a huge blow to your opponent."

The general game-plan is much the same (so the tips below are still valid), but I feel the current list is a bit more appropriate for actual competitive play.</strong></span>  &nbsp;  This deck is designed to have a great deal of versatility whether going first or second, although ideally you will go first.  Going first your goal is to get Eldlich on the field backed by some backrow, as well as to hopefully get the Dogmatika Saint on the field with Fleur in hand and Punishment set. To accomplish this, Nadir lets you mill the Bastard dragon to search out Saint, who you then normal summon to search Punishment. In the end phase, Bastard triggers to get you Fleur in hand, allowing you to set up multiple disruptions with a single card at no cost. Eldlich is then either searched, milled or summoned off of Black Awakening to make your Golden Land traps live. If you can't get Eldlich out instantly, sitting on Scarlet Sanguine is acceptable since you can just summon Eldlich instantly on your opponent's turn with that anyway. In order to make the best use of Scarlet Sanguine and a Golden Land trap, be sure to chain Scarlet Sanguine to the desired Golden Land (for instance, activate Conquistador <em>then </em>Scarlet, thus making Conquistador's ""destroy a face-up card"" effect live on resolution). Going first is ideal since the deck is largely trap-based, but thanks to Eldlich's hand effect and the board-breaking utility of Dogmatika, going second is also a solid option for the deck even without siding.  For going second, getting Eldlich into your hand is a priority since he sets up your GY while also removing threats. Nadir allows you to both pop a card with N'tss and search out Saint, who searches out Fleur for additional negation and beatdown power. Impermanence is present to serve as a potential disruption during turn 1 and can be replaced with basically any hand trap, but the utility of Impermanence makes it stronger against the plethora of Ash Blossom-resistant decks that now exist. Thanks to Eldlich being a level 10, you also have fairly easy access to notable Rank 10s such as Gustav Max and Liebe to help with OTKing (though be aware Disciple and Saint lock you out of the Extra Deck for the turn after you use them).  All in all this deck has incredible resource management, solid disruption and good damage output. Thanks to Eldlich the deck is overall quite resistant to hand traps and board wipes. The Dogmatika engine is a bit more fragile, but offers additional disruption for essentially no cost and helps tremendously with board-breaking and OTKing."

With the new rank 4 addition really makes the deck flows and super consistent on spewing Teardrop the Rikka Queen + its double o,"I think Konami plays YGO online simulator too, knowing the fact that this specific rank 4, Strenae the Rikka Queen, works so good in this deck. Anyway, I will explain this deck basic core and strategy. It uses Auroradon-001 combo (idk know which one is busted Halqifibrax or Auroradon) for summoning Strenae and at the same time provides us 2 draws for our 9 Rikka extenders (9 out of 40 cards is kinda big chance): 3 Snowdrop, 3 Mudan, 3 Glamour (Mudan searches Glamour then searches Snowdrop, so basically we need Snowdrop).  There is 2 version combo as our starters are mainly on the semi/limited list. First, I will explain the longer version since it is our main goal and better disruption. The starter is Tour Guide/Scorpio. Tour Guide ss Sangan, make Cherubini, use Chrubini dump Naturia Rosewhip, use Sangan add Arboria, ss Arboria make Halqifibrax. The Predap Scorpio one, use Scorpio ss Cobra, use Cobra add Instant Fusion, use Instant Fusion ss tuner make Halqifibrax. From both route use Halqifibrax ss Deskbot 001 (basically just regular Auroradon combo) make Auroradon, ss 3 tokens, use 001 ss itself make Cthugua, use Auroradon tribute 2 tokens ss Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing, use Coltwing ss 2 tokens, use 001 ss itself again make another Cthugua, make Strenae using 2 Cthugua and draw for 2, use Strenae add Rosewhip from GY. From here Snowdrop can tribute Strenae to ss itself and Rosewhip, then Strenae will trigger and summoning Teardrop with plant material. Then we can synchro summon the lv3 token + Rosewhip (depends on you, since Rosewhip is a Winda for s/t which is kinda good) for Marjoram, use Marjoram add Blessed Winds as disruption and recovery card.  The shorter version is basically if we cant Cherubini before Halqifibrax, meaning we wont have access to Rosewhip, so after summoning Snowdrop together with other plant, we use Snowdrop and targeting itself making all plant lv8, resulting us with 2 Teardrops which isnt very bad (maybe).  Since the engine takes space and Rikka has summoning restriction, we only play the good Rikka (in my opinion), being the 9 cards I mentioned + Rikka Tranquility (can summon Rikka or Rosewhip from GY, only tribute monster after we used its disruption tho) and Rikka Sheet (kinda bad but searchable, just a bootleg Impermanence or Widow Anchor).  The combo lineup: 2 Cobra and 2 Coltwing (we need our combo to succeed, cus if it fails its just zero board presence, also Cobra is a plant target for Snowdrop despite being a once per duel effect), 3 Sangan (1 card Halqifbrax by searching Arboria or handtrap if we have Arboria), 3 Arboria (most of our low level can go to Almiraj, playing 3 Arboria makes them less bricky), Naturia Rosewhip (thank God Konami printed level 3 tuner plant with good effect), Spore (just there, bootleg Glow-up Bulb), and the remaining combo pieces is self explanatory.  The rest of main deck is just Crossout package which can function as handtrap or prevention getting handtrapped.  The extra deck: Just combo pieces with some breaking board follow-up plays. PK Break Sword (as we can recycle our level 3 engine with Blessed Winds, this one I think is a good choice), Borreload Dragon (non-targeting non-destruction monster removal), Accesscode (easy access from our leftover like Auroradon), Knightmares (deck is tight, you can try switching).  Expected end board:  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/gQNNJtp.png"" alt=""image"" />  Replay: <a>https://bit.ly/2Vora6r</a> (trigger warning: the Eldlich doenst read Accescode, for some reason I entered a room with only 4 cards in starting hand like wtf)  Pros: Super consistent with one card starter, fresh first turn board, able to go second thanks to Crossout package and Rikka xyz, great recursion thanks to Marjoram/Blessed winds, easier access to handtrap thanks to 2 draws from Chtugua and Sangan search.  Cons: Not very strong board, our recursion source is very fragile (face-up and a backrow too)."

It means losing interaction, as well as the Fusion Destiny package, but frees up space in the extra deck and main deck, and increases consistency. You're a blind going second deck, with a bunch of options going first.  I'm going to start in a weird place. HEROES have many appeals, but I think a big one is the ROTAS. In addition to Reinforcement of the Army searching most of your starters, namely Stratos, Solid Soldier, and Liquid Soldier, and sometimes Shadow Mist, but E Emergency Call searches all of these as well as Honest Neos. A Hero Lives is the best of them all, starting you with a Stratos on the field without using a normal summon - your most insane hand is actually these 5 cards.  One thing to mention about A Hero Lives alongside Isolde, is that its a 1 card combo that ends on your choice of Darklaw + Absolute Zero + Sunrise + Mask Change, or Dread Decimator pointing to three Monsters. You can even end on Plasma + Sunrise + 1, off of just this one card. Thanks Isolde! You do this by going Stratos into Stratos, Stratos into Faris, then both Stratos into Isolde. From here there are a lot of lines you can take, and any other extenders or Rotas makes this way more powerful.  3 Stratos serve as the most important starter in your deck. These search any other creature in the deck off of a normal or special summon, which is pretty sweet, and the spell and trap removal is clutch too. 3 Faris is the other starter - this one card basically becomes 3 monsters, which is pretty good. You need 2 Increase and Vyon to search off of Faris.  Shadow Mist is the key searcher in the deck when forced to go first, and you need a way to special her to make Dark Law. The deck has plenty, from both of Solid Soldier's effects to one of Liquid Soldier's effects to Isolde in the extra deck. The searching effect is useful in pulling off OTKs with big boards full of monsters going second as well. It's either or on this card.  Solid Soldier and Liquid Soldier are both super-valuable cards, for different reasons. I'd run 2 Liquid easily if I has space, and I'd run 3 Solid, but the thing is with 5 Rotas you don't really need to. Solid Soldier can use both effects, and alongside Stratos can search Faris, make Isolde, find a monster to discard for Faris, and then use Isolde to summon either another Stratos or Shadow Mist. This is without other extenders. If you have something to discard to Faris, that's when the combo gets crazy - make Cross Crusader the usual way to extend combos as normal, and when you Fusion Summon Sunrise, you can special a monster from your GY, such as a Stratos to search a monster or a Shadow Mist to get a Mask Change. Liquid Soldier is super key as fusion material - the card draw is very valuable, while its summon effect is more icing, that-works well summoning Shadow Mist or Stratos. Sometimes I grab this with Isolde just to use as material, despite having its effects turned off for the turn.  2 Malicious are obligatory, even at 2 it's still pretty essential to the combo. 1 Plasma is the only other Destiny Hero to make the cut in the 40 card version. Shutting off Monster Effects is good, and the deck has ways to increase his mediocre power aplenty. This just adds to the potential going first plays.  Honest Neos is a searchable hand trap that helps with Trinity OTKS. We also have one Evil Hero Adusted Gold and one Dark Calling, to make Malicious Bane when needed.  For fusions Spells, we have 1 Poly to search off of Vyon, 1 Miracle Fusion to search off of Sunrise, 1 aforementioned Dark Calling, and 3 Mask Change.  We needed 5 equip spells to really get reliable summons off of Isolde, especially since sometimes you want to summon Faris off of her. Favorite Hero has become my favourite of them - it can help you pump Trinity up to 10000 ATK points with Honest Neos while also finding your mystic mine. Phoenix Blade is (funnily enough) sometimes useful just to banish E Heroes in you GY for The Shining, and is also just an equip you can get back for low cost. Axe of Fools hard negates effects on cards. This is good Omni-Negate bait at the least, and a nasty thing to put on Apollousa or Winda ect. Horn of the Unicorn and Malevolent Nuzzler aren't amazing, but they put in just enough work getting Dark Law above 3000 Atk points. They are primarily here so that if we see 2 equip spells, so long as one of them is one of these we can put them back into our deck.  Side deck is split into 2 parts - about half deals with backrow decks, while a little over half deals with monster decks (with Evenly Matched overlapping a bit). This lets you cut the Equip spells when you know you aren't going first for whichever interaction is appropriate in your matchup. The reason for the weird split on the spell and trap card removal is that against the Mystic Mine Burn decks it gives them more outs to name, making it harder to get a lock."

Don't get me wrong, with the right circumstances this deck can be crazy and just OTK even competitive decks. This deck mainly resolves around going second, spamming your superheavy samurai synchro's on the board (wich is very easily done with your main deck monsters) and eventually OTK'ing your opponent with very big beatsticks that can attack over almost anything in battle. Superheavy samurai's don't play spell and trap cards because most effects won't go off if there is a spell/trap card in the graveyard, this is very much one of the biggest weaknesses of the deck and really prevents the deck from playing staple going second cards (like ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=14532163&amp;_ga=2.7716466.1946221507.1586598726-468166994.1525448304"">lightning storm</a>"" or ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Evenly%20Matched"">Evenly matched</a>""). The other gimmick is that the big superheavy samurai's can attack while in defense mode and apply their DEF for damage calculation, this is why all the strong cards have a very low ATK but a very big DEF.  Here I will quickly go over a few cards and why they are important;  <strong>""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Big%20Benkei""><span>Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei</span></a>""</strong>  This big boy is the main deck boss monster and is just an easy to bring out strong beatstick that allows all your samurai's to attack whilein defense mode. Usually you just cheat him out the deck by the effect of ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Soulpeacemaker"">Superheavy Samurai Soulpeacemaker</a>"" or by tributing ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Big%20Waraji"">Superheavy Samurai Big Waraji</a>"".  &nbsp;  <strong>""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Thief"">Superheavy Samurai Thief</a>""</strong>  ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Thief"">Superheavy Samurai Thief</a>"" together with Superheavy Samurai ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Big%20Waraji"">Big Waraji</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Transporter"">Transporter</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Scales"">Scales</a>"" and ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Magnet"">Magnet</a>"" all special summon themselves or other samurai's to the field to easily go into your synchro monsters.  &nbsp;  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Superheavy%20Samurai%20Trumpeter""><strong>""Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter""</strong></a>  This card is in my opinion one of the strongest cards in the deck and allow it to function much better than it should be.

You can also banish this card from your GY to shuffle a card from your hand back into the deck and draw a new card.

Wyvern can add box to your hand which lets you add frame to your hand. Always fusion chaos ancient gear giant if you can, and if you are using multiple golems/ultimate pound summon megaton of ultimate golem.

Now it's even more OP with Dinos. OTK and counter your opponent at will. ,Basically you'd want to have Ultimate Conductor Tyranno on the field as much as possible. There are a lot of ways to summon him with this deck and it also has a lot of versatility because of the shaddoll fusions. Best case scenario is if you're able to get out Tyranno and Winda on the field. It's almost certain that you'll win once that happens. There are also a lot of good xyz options in the side deck that could be a counter for any of your opponent's plays. It's so easy and fun to otk using this deck ALWAYS TRY TO GO SECOND  TO GET THAT OTK. The side deck also has cards that will allow you to adjust to your opponent's deck on the succeeding matches.

Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram (aka Big Momma Marj) along with Aromaseraphy Jasmine are your key cards and both need to be summoned as quickly as possible in order to move the strategy along. These two cards will allow you to bring out you ""Winds"" Traps cards, focusing on Blessed Winds, in order to control the field.  The update comes from the addition of Gigaplant, Fallen Angel of Roses, and Rose Bell. With these cards, I believe, the deck is given some need ""oomph"" and extra deck summoning boost. I believe this to be true because I was always searching form a monster to bring out with my Lonefire after I set up my early game board of Sweet Marjoram and both Jasmines. I also added Relinquished Anima to help the going second game, along with my Thousand-Eyes Restrict (love taking those monsters off my opponents side).  As a side, I included Gizmek Yata in this build in order to take advantage of the second normal summon it provides along with its LP boost, which is always greatly appreciated in an Aroma deck. The second normal summon can be used to help bring out your other plant monsters.  I have tried to build the Main Deck in order to fulfill the requirements for either going first or second in the first game.  This includes the card selections in the Extra deck as well."

Allowing the opponent to do nothing while their LP ticks away.,"This deck is effectively a deck where when your opponent makes a move you can counter it if necessary, and if you play the percentages right (meaning negating only what is necessary and not everything they do). You will find yourself with weak monsters on the board but your opponent has no cards in play or in their hands so you can just peck them down to O LP and win. The artifacts in this deck are used to take out nasty cards, lockdown your opponent farther, or just to continue knocking down their LP.  notes  if you have the chance early on to take out multifaker you might want to wait until they have their boss monster to take out multifaker and then silquitous or kunquery to return it to the hand (or extra deck) or just negate its affects so you can run over it next turn.  if possible make your big moves during the opponents battle phase so your moves have a lesser chance of being negated.  in general all your moves depend on your opponent so be smart based on the archetype you are up against.

You get the light fairy by making Beatrice or Mechquipped Angineer then linking it away for Gravity Controller. Or Special summoning Artifact Dagda and linking that away. This deck is extremely consistent in bringing out Norleras from my testing, about a 90% rate turn 1."

You can build several variants of this as well. Check out <a>this video</a> to learn what the ""core"" of the deck is. You are going to be looking for four cards to know if you have full combo: Necro Slime, Swirl Slime, Lamia, and a monster you can normal summon (preferably Kepler because he searches Gate for you). The deck gets destroyed by hand traps for now sadly, but going first helps this a bit.  If you have Kepler start here Otherwise start at step 3. <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Kepler in the far left zone. Activate his effect to search Gate.</li>  	<li>Activate Gate to search whichever of the other three you might be missing. If you have all of them, search what you feel.</li>  	<li>Activate Swirl sending Necro from hand. Fusion summons small Ghenghis to the second to left zone.</li>  	<li>Activate Swirl in the grave to special summon Lamia from hand.</li>  	<li>Ghenghis' effect can trigger to special summon Necro from the grave. (I know it sounds weird, but wait.)</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Alexander using lamia and Genghis.</li>  	<li>Send Alexander and Necro Slime to make Cross-Sheep.</li>  	<li>Now, activate Necro sending small Ghenghis to fusion summon big Gengis to the far-right zone.</li>  	<li>Trigger Crosssheep to special summon back Alexander to the middle zone.</li>  	<li>Trigger Ghengis to special summon Lamia back.</li>  	<li>Link Summon Crystron Halqiifibrax in big Genghis' spot (Needlefiber) using lamia and big Genghis.</li>  	<li>Needlefiber's effect can special summon ghost from the deck to the left of alexander</li>  	<li>Trigger alexander to summon lamia from the grave.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Crystal Wing using lamia and Alexander</li>  	<li>Then normal summon your monster for the turn if you haven't already to the furthest left zone.</li>  	<li>Link summon Gilgamesh using Ghost and the normal summoned monster. <ol>  	<li>Optionally chain-link Ghengis then ghost to send another necro slime to the grave and protect the Gilgamesh trigger.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Ghenghis effect to set your scales with Ragnarok and Apocalypse</li>  	<li>Apocalypse pendulum effect to banish ghost and big Genghis.</li>  	<li>When ghost is banished, add small Genghis to your grave again.</li>  	<li>Now, use Lamia's effect to special summon it to the far left zone from grave by popping Gilgamesh.</li>  	<li>Ragnarok's pendulum effect triggers letting you special summon small Genghis to Cross-sheep's other zone.</li>  	<li>Lastly, synchro into Siegfried using Apocalypse and lamia.</li> </ol> At this point, the combo ends for your turn. It isn't a powerful board, but you have a spell/trap negate and a monster negate. However, the combo continues on your opponent's turn. <ol>  	<li>Use your Siegfried negate</li>  	<li>Use your Crystal Wing negate (You may decide you do not need to do either of these steps before step 3. Your call)</li>  	<li>Needlefiber's effect to ""tag-out"" for formula synchro (same zone)</li>  	<li>Chain its synchro effect and draw effect in either order</li>  	<li>Synchro Siegfried and Formula Synchron into Satellite Warrior.</li>  	<li>You should be able to destroy 3 cards.</li>  	<li>Cross-sheep's effect lets you revive formula again.</li>  	<li>Activate Formula Synchron's effect to synchro Borreload Savage Dragon.</li>  	<li>Borreload Savage adds Gilgamesh and gives you another negate.</li> </ol> Now we have a pretty nasty board overall. We severely hurt our opponent and may have won the game from this alone.  Now, the draw spells and combo extenders may need explanation: <ul>  	<li>Copernicus: let's you send a necro slime to the grave. You do not need it to start in hand if you can still fusion Genghis without using Lamia as material</li>  	<li>Where arf thou? If you have lamia, it is not as helpful. If you have Kepler, it lets you search the lamia to end</li> </ul> There we have it. As I said, my build is already tailored. You may find another variation like Dave's Artifact engine to be better."

While it is fun, I definitely would call the standard painter builds ""better"" as they're a bit more consistent and the variety of Floodgates that they work with over combo pieces can give them a fighting chance against more competitive decks - this build currently doesn't do that nearly as well on a consistent basis.

Add that with Verte-Dragoon, boom every d","Konami never learn, from Knightmare Mermaid, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, and now this. Disciple of the Nadir is 1 card combo for El Shaddoll Winda, combined with Red-Eyes Dragoon, you can literally play anything now and win. The Nadir combo is simple (almost everyone knows it), use Nadir dump Apkallone search Albus Nullius (you can search the other if you have dark fodder in GY), use Apkallone add Shaddoll Ruq discard Albus Nullius, now we have Ruq in hand, and Winda material in GY (Apkallone+Albus Nullius/any dark). But remember, Nadir needs to be used at the last of your plays (even Verte has to resolve before Nadir). End board is Winda and Red-Eyes Dragoon (if you play combo deck it will be better).  The Dragma lineup: 3 Nadir (1 card Winda), 1 Albus Nullius (dark fodder, a super poly with body and non-targeting too), 1 Ecclesia (another target if you already have dark in GY or Nullius is drawn, searches the trap card), 1 Dragma Punishment (destroy monster and another card if you sent N'tss). That's pretty much it, mybe people will figure things more after a while.  Shaddoll lineup: 1 Apkallone (searches Ruq or recycles itself but with discarding), 1 Winda (great floodgate, can even be replaced with any Shaddol depends on the material in GY), 1 Ruq (searchable, fusion using your field and/or GY as material, a non-targeting non-destruction removal too, the monster fusion summoned cant atk directly).  Dark Magician lineup: Standard, but I dont play Magician Navigation as its requirement is kinda hard. I prefer the searchers and draws, but most only 2 because they dont accompolish anything alone (not 1 card combo). Magicians' Souls are the best, free monster, draw, and dumps Dark Magician too. Dark Magic Attack is just searchable Harpies Feather Duster. Apprentice Illusion Magician is our atk booster (from hand/field) for Dragoon and Winda. And lastly, 1 Eternal Soul cus its searchable.  Other support: Eye of Timaeus (I prefer this than Secrets of Dark Magic cus it doesnt eat many resource to fusion summon as Dragoon needs hand as fodder), Magicalized Fusion (can be easy Dragoon or other fusion, cus DM can turn itself into Imduk which is a dragon for easy material), Spellbook engine (1 each, cus hopt and blue boy eats normal summon), Super Poly (yall know the reason), and the rest are just handtraps (can be turned into Almiraj for the Dragma, also Veiler is a spellcaster, can run D.D. Crow too as it is a dark).  Extra deck: Fusion pieces with generic links.  Pros: Winda + Dragoon are legit board, bunch of draws/searches, has handtraps and super poly, possible disruption with Dark Magical Circle too.  Cons: Other combo deck can utilize Dragma-Winda and Verte-Dragoon with more busted board, weak to D.D. Crow or similar cards like that.  Cards to think of: Other Dragma cards (can be put in, but the engine above is enough imo), Other Shaddoll fusion monsters (depends on what attribute you played, as El Shaddoll Construct is still a good card), Allure of Darkness (can be put in, but it banishes dark, it means no fusion material and we only play a few dark), Borreload (can be put in as non-targeting removal, but after testing I never have the resource to summon it).  &nbsp;"

Just like my old Timelord deck, the strategy has not changed that much, you still finish the match with Gustav Max( given that you choose so) to acquire either a FTK or an OTK. <ul>  	<li>You normal summon a Timelord monster( I recommend Michion)</li>  	<li>You use Celestial Transformation to special summon another Timelord monster in your hand( I still recommend Michion)</li>  	<li>After battle, They activate their effects and if you started the battle at 8000 LP, your opponent will have 2000 LP left if the effects aren't negated by other means.</li>  	<li>And then Xyz summon Gustax Max and end the duel.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  I added a couple of cards that really make this deck more in control than ever.  <strong>Sales Pitch </strong>is a card that makes your add 1 card to your hand when your opponent adds a card to their hand, this makes it much more easier to search out Celestial Transformation to attempt a FTK/OTK or search other essential cards. But you can't use them in the same turn you searched the card out.  <strong>Lightning Storm </strong>is a game changer here, since the deck doesn't use many face up monsters at once, it will be easy to pull off its effects, simply clear out your opponent's backrow so you can avoid ""unwanted twists"" and proceed to annihilate them.  The decks becomes much more difficult to counter it due to its destructive capabilities, and since Timelords can't be destroyed it becomes more depressing to be facing a deck like this with a deck that can't counter Timelords's effects.  And of course some decks can get away easily with Timelords by either banishing them, tribute them, or just cancel out their effects and make them sitting ducks, But only a <strong>few</strong> are capable of doing that.  So there it is, my timelord deck, feel free to use it. And as always, let me know what you think about it, Timelords don't get the recognition they deserve because they are ""indestructable"" which is not true. Timelords need some love too."

Exodia pieces not there yet?,"One of my go to decks on ygopro is my Exodia Final Countdown build. Basically, you'll have two win conditions:  Win Condition #1: Draw all 5 Exodia Pieces  Win Condition #2: Use Final Countdown and after 20 turns you auto-win the duel  You'll be making use of Mystic Mine of course to stall while you get your exodia pieces or wait for final countdown(whichever comes first ^_-). Metaverse and Demise of the Land will be your cards for getting Mystic Mine on the field. I have Terraforming(1) in the side deck if needed.  Metaverse(1) is a good trap to use on your opponent's turn and will allow you to search for Mystic Mine and either add it to your hand or activate it on your field. Demise of the Land is in my opinion the best card for getting Mystic Mine on the field. Demise of the Land is a Quick-Play spell. When your opponent special summons a monster(s) you can activate Demise of the Land and it will search out Mystic Mine and auto activate it on the field.  Obviously your opponent will try to kill off your field spell, as such I put in counters to protect it. Solemn Judgment and Dark Bribe. Solemn Judgment makes you pay half your LP but it can negate any Spell/Trap/Monster Effect/Summon and destroy it(this card is great to combo with Hope for Escape for more draw power!). Dark Bribe negates and destroys any activated Spell/Trap from your opponent in exchange for them drawing 1 card. There are other traps that can help(The Huge Revolution is Over and Starlight Road for one), but these work just as well.  Next, we have our draw power. Upstart Goblin(1), One day of Peace(1), Sales Pitch(1), Reckless Greed(3), Pot of Duality(2), Hope for Escape(2) and Legacy of Yata-Garasu(3). Another amazing card to use is Ledger of Legerdemain(2). This card basically banishes the top 3 cards of your deck facedown(you can view them) and on your 3rd Standby Phase after this card's activation, you can add those 3 banished cards to your hand. Basically perfect for getting some guaranteed exodia pieces to ensure your victory.  Besides Mystic Mine, we have other stalls: Spiritual Swords of Revealing Light(2) and Threatening Roar(2). Spiritual Swords allows you pay 1000 LP to negate an attack. This is also good to combo with Hope for Escape for more draw power! You can banish this card and it can prevent your opponent from direct attacking you for the rest of the turn! Threatening Roar prevents your opponent from battling on their turn, just make sure to use it before the Battle Phase!  Finally, we have Trap Trick(2). This trap allows you to banish one copy of a normal trap from your deck and you can set another copy of that banished trap to your field and it can be activated on that turn(even on your opponent's turn).  I have included 12 extra deck monsters in the deck more so to make use of Pot of Extravagance which can banish 3 or 6 cards from your Extra Deck to draw. If you banish 3 you get 1 card, banish 6 and you get 2 cards. I have a Pot of Extravagance in the side deck for you to make use of if you so desire.  I'll close by saying, this is a broken deck. You have 2 win conditions, you can stall your opponent and prevent them from playing yugioh with Mystic Mine and you have a decent amount of draw power for your exodia pieces/to get final countdown! This is a perfect troll deck to use, especially on the weekends!  &nbsp;  Good luck and Have fun!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

When you are summoning <a data-name=""Uria, Lord of Searing Flames"">Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</a> try to have a <a data-name=""Hyper Blaze"">Hyper Blaze</a> on board as it is the main card to finish your opponent in 1 hit. Also if it is possible, summon Uria through its original conditions in order to resurrect it with Hyper Blaze in case Uria dies. A downside of this deck is that it can't search for Uria so matches can be pretty long. You can add <a data-name=""Opening the Spirit Gates"">Opening the Spirit Gates</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> to fix this issue."

I think its perfect for link based strategies like this one (or salad e.g.).</li>  	<li>I run 2 Crusadia Draco. Of course you can run 3 if you want, but any 2 card combo searches this card.</li>  	<li>Formud skipper is a new addition, due to parallel exceed. Formud skipper + any Crusadia monster = Bagooska + Crusadia Equimax that can attack all DEFENSE (due to Bagooska) position monsters with 4000 Atk :)</li>  	<li>In my opinion, 3x Cosmic Cyclone its really nice. You have the room (the monster line up is more or less 15 Crusadia cards and the rest what you play does not matter), thus Cosmic Cyclone seems like a good fit. Decks like Eldlich, Salamangreat, Paleozoic (even decks like Cyber dragon and other) have effects that activate when you destroy their backrow.</li>  	<li>Monster Reborn, World Legacy Succesion and Living Fossil all serve the same purpose. Any of them + a Crusadia is full combo (thus reducing chance of brick hands).</li>  	<li>Topologic Bomber Dragon and Topologic Trisbaena are nice, because they can be chain blocked by Crusadia Krawler.</li> </ul> I am curious to hear what you guys think!

Here a version of the cyber dragon deck with a 2 cards combo for summon true king of all calamity T1 and kill with anaconda and himeratech ramgage dragon T2. The deck can easily go first, and still very strong go second (still cyber dragon!).  With Cyber Dragon Core and machine dup we can make true king of all calamity, one of the big boss of all the game.  Normal Summon Core. Effet add cyber revsystem to the handmachine dup summon 2 cyber dragon from the deck XYZ summon, infinitrack river stromer, effect add anchor drill to the hand. Link Summon platinum gadget. Activate Cyber revsystem reborn cyber dragon. Effect of platinum summon anchor drill from the hand. Effect of anchor drill, heim and cyber dragon became both lvl 9. Special summon calamity.  that's the simpliest combo. Ohterwise, it needs on the board river storm, and 2 monsters. one to summon platinum gadget and one level 5 for xyz summon calamity. Galaxy soldier helps a lot. With a good hand, we can make infinity with calamity. With the perfect hand, we can have cybernetic overflow.  Now i explain my choices for my cards:  3 galaxy soldier because level 5 helps a lot for the combo. Cyber dragon infinity before normal summon cber dragon core is wonderfull. Nova can reborn a lvl 5 (very usefull!)  Only one cyber repair plant because you don't want it in hand when you go first, it's sometimes difficult to activate.  Three overload fusion beacause it's an extender when you go first (lvl 5, and can foolish 2 light machine, herz and core, effect herz and core to the hand!), and we need 3 because i play anaconda and pot of desires.  Two pot of desires only because i play 3 galaxy soldier, 6 lvl 5 in the main deck. don't activate it at the beginning of your turn if you want to summon calamity!  The other cards ratios are classics, You can change the stapples easily according to the meta.  Enjoy!  &nbsp;"

I'm just going to jump into the choices here.  I have 9 slots dedicated to interaction. I've been testing with D.D. Crow, but I want backrow to send with Scrap Wyvern, so I'm trying Solemn Strike. The deck is seriously lacking effect negation, outside of Apollousa, and while it is not quite a Salamngreat Roar it does a pretty good impression most of the time. Called and Ash should be obvious. We have a lot of stuff to protect with Called, which is often a good offensive card as well, and Ash is just the most consistent hand trap in the format.  Machina Gearframe is one of the deck's main starters, and a combo piece. It's a highly depowered Stratos that is also a union monster. We're a largely main deck focused deck, and this helps find all of our pieces. I'm running 3, because we need to start plays.  Scrap Recycler is our other starter. You can use it to make Link 4s by itself, but it is at its best when summoned off of Platinum Gadget after gearframe. I've sent literally every machine in the deck except itself - there are reasons to. Often, the best monster to send is Machina Fortress. The Scrap engine requires Scrap Golem. We're running 2, because even though it is a total brick, I want to be able to use the Recycler when I see it. O-Lion turns this card into a 1 card Scrap Wyvern, and with Gizmek Orochi you can make Dingirsu pretty easily.  3 Citadel seems pretty obvious. This is simultaneously our main (recurring) boss monster and our main line of interaction. I'm also running 3 Fortress. Fortress is insane, being able so summon it repeatedly is excellent when your hand is full of monsters. Note that you can send monsters whose levels equal over 8, meaning you can pitch O-Lion with fodder to get a free token when you see that brick. 3 Air Raider and Irradiator are necessary - these are combo pieces that help get Fortress on the board while extending your combos. 2 Possesstorage are used in some of the decks combos and make some low-end hands playable. Between it and Irradiator, you have plenty of ways to use Machina Megaform as a searcher, as well as an extra floating effect on fortress (it can also extend combos).  Redeployment is excellent. While the deck doesn't always love pitching cards, it forms the core of so many 2 card combos. Machina Overdrive is also really powerful, particularly going first. If you send it to the GY you get an Upstart Goblin out of it, and it really helps get Citadel in a pinch, which is good, because that's a lot of the deck.  For Xyz monsters in the extra deck, I have 2 Dingirsu for Rank 8s, 1 Dracossack as a rank 7, and all of the Rank 10 Railcannons. Dingirsu is obviously awesome, but has some synergy with an archetype built around destroying itself. Being machine type is clutch in this deck. Dracossack hardly comes up, but it turns some low end boards into boards with an extra Link 4. It turns 2 monsters into 3. It can also help in the grind game, which is good because the deck's plan is grindy. Super Dora is pretty good to make off of Megaform into a 2nd Citadel. The other railcannons help Otk.  For links, we have Apollousa, Borrelsword, and Unchained Abomination. The Unchained Abomination is good against backrow decks, and gives us some spell-speed 2 interaction. It can also be made easily off of Triple Burst Dragon with 1 other monster. Borrelsword is there to OTK, and Apollousa is our one easily accessible way to negate monster effects. Wyvern is an essential combo pieces, while Platinum Gadget is a useful extender out of the extra deck, and good fodder for Wyvern. Qlipohort Genius gives us some generic effect negation that is really solid again Link Monsters, doesn't die to Lightning Storm, and is and Earth Machine monster, which is super relevant in the deck. I:P is used to give protection to your other link monsters, and also lets you combo off into link monsters on your opponent's turn, making Air Raider way stronger.  I like this main deck going first, so the side deck are options to become a go-second deck and OTK. I also threw in the D.D. Crows I pulled from the main.

Ok, it won't be an OTK, but with its versatility once you get on the field Toadally Awesome or D.3.S Frog y","<strong>[ MAIN STRATEGY ]</strong>  This deck is made so that you can face different types of opponents with its versatily. However, your main objective is to play around <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a>. You can normal summon <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> and activate its effect to send to the graveyard (from your hand or deck) one <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a> or <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a>, or other frogs such as <a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a> so you can use them from the graveyard. If your opponent prevents you from interacting with the graveyard, some magic cards or a <a data-name=""Unifrog"">Unifrog</a> come to your help. But which card should I send to the graveyard? Well, it depends on the situation, if you have one <a data-name=""Des Frog"">Des Frog</a> in your hand I would suggest <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a>. Anyway, after that you can activate the second effect of your <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> and get it in your hand again, so you can special summon it for the second time in your turn (with a ""Frog"" tribute from your hand) and send another card to the graveyard. If your tribute is another <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> and in one turn you manage to send three of them in the graveyard, you only need one </a><a data-name=""Des Frog"">Des Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in your hand so you can get three of them on the field. If you have </a><a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> you can fusion summon D.3.S Frog and play around power. Anyway, this is a control deck because the majority of time you won't be able to summon </a><a data-name=""D.3.S Frog"">D.3.S Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">. This is not a problem since many cards can counter or destroy it. That's why, if you can early in the game, you can summon </a><a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in one turn (which is very easy to do) and take control of the field with its effects. You only need one ""Frog"" tribute and you'll never run out of frogs since you can get them back from the graveyard. </a><a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> may look like a troll card (especially because of its name lmao) but it can deny every monster effect, magic or trap card when activated and it's not finished yet! If you want you can take control of that magic/trap card and place it on the field! Awesome!</a>  <strong>[ WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE SWAP FROG? ]</strong>  Don't give up. If the situation is hard, you can try to play around <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> or <a data-name=""Beelze Frog"">Beelze Frog</a> in combination with <a data-name=""Wetlands"">Wetlands</a> and <a data-name=""Aquarium Stage"">Aquarium Stage</a>. <a data-name=""Beelze Frog"">Beelze Frog</a> is not so powerful to combo with the rest of your deck alone, but its attack increases for every <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T</a><a data-name="".A.D.P.O.L.E."">.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in the graveyard. Not bad! Also, if you need it, you can always count on playing defensive with </a><a data-name=""Aquarium Stage"">Aquarium Stage</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">, so that you won't lose Life Points and your frogs won't be destroyed in battle. If you don't have </a><a data-name=""Aquarium Stage"">Aquarium Stage</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> you can try by playing </a><a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in defense mode (if it goes to the graveyard you can special summon </a><a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> easily) and with trap cards such as </a><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> to protect your monsters until you get the right cards. This is really common in the first turn if you don't have </a><a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> immediately, so don't give up until your LP goes to zero, you still have a chance!</a>  <strong>[ WAIT, NO SUBSTITOAD? ]</strong>  Exactly. You don't need it. I feel like <a data-name=""Substitoad"">Substitoad</a> is not necessary since all it does you can do it with other monsters such as <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> or <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a>. I mean, you can add if you want, of course it's a banned card, but since this deck is not an OTK it doesn't really fit well.  <strong>[ WHAT ABOUT THOSE TRAP CARDS? ]</strong>  I put one <a data-name=""Froggy Forcefield"">Froggy Forcefield</a> and two <a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> cards to show you how it's really up to you. Let's be honest, Mirror Force is stronger that Froggy Forcefield. Why? Well, let's say the enemy can directly attack your Life Points. <a data-name=""Froggy Forcefield"">Froggy Forcefield</a> is completely useless in this case. Moreover, you need to control one ""Frog"" monster on the field, and since you can play defensive until you get the right card without taking damage, it can be a useless card to draw in most situations. That's why <a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> can be more useful in many situations, but some cards can counter it. That's also why I always suggest a different variety of cards, even if the final result if the same, such as <a data-name=""Unifrog"">Unifrog</a> and <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>, even though <a data-name=""Unifrog"">Unifrog</a> will be a tribute the majority of time.  <strong>[ WHAT ABOUT MORAY OF GREED? ]</strong>  I put that in the deck because I wanted to show you a non-banned deck. However, I never play <a data-name=""Moray of Greed"">Moray of Greed</a> since I prefer <em><a data-name=""Pot of Gree"">Pot of Gree</a>d </em>a lot and I don't care about tournaments. I just play for fun like playing against a friend, which is the main purpose of this deck: for fun. Moreover, <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a> is useful when you only get magic cards and you don't have monsters, a situation where <a data-name=""Moray of Greed"">Moray of Greed</a> lacks a lot. It can be also used when you want to find <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> faster. So, in the end, unless you are going <em>pvp</em> or you can't use banned cards, go with <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a>.  <strong>[ DES CROAKING ]</strong>  This is a useful card to burst damage your opponent especially when you fusion summon <a data-name=""D.3.S Frog"">D.3.S Frog</a>. You can use it just before <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> to clear the field and burst your damage. It will be more efficient if you have 3 <a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a><a data-name=""Treeborn Frog""> cards</a> in the graveyard. Remember some frogs are considered ""Des Frog"" when on the field.  <strong>[ THANK YOU FOR READING! ]</strong>  Feel free to use this deck or to modify it according to your personal tastes, which I always recommend! This is my favourite version after trying different ones because I feel like it fits my playstyle and it can be very versatile in most situations. Have fun!"

Other control cards include Solemn Judgement and Solemn Strike.

The win condition is take control of the game with hand traps and do your basic Trickstar plays. Summon Candina to add Light Stage, get Lycoris. Remember that Lycoris can dodge negates like veiler allowing your Candina to resolve. Lilybell can be summoned when bounce to hand by lycoris what allows you to push 1600 damage and recycle 2 cards. There's nothing really new that this format promotes to the deck and because we don't have tournaments i'm going to explain how this deck is intended to work against the most played decks of the internet meta.  Against Adamatia you have hand traps like Ash, Veiler and Imperm to slow them down, but while an Ash on Granite can stop their turn sometimes normally it won't happen that way. Your strong cards here are Crackdown and Reincarnation. Take their rocks before they can summon more monsters can end the turn. Banishing the hole hand can hurt a lot because the deck need a lot of engine cards in multiple copies. Going first you can Called by the Grave Block Dragon to avoid them to have follow up but is the type of card you will side out once it doesn't mean a threat to your opponent first turn. You can side in Sphere Mode, Nibiru and Summon limit to have a much more solid chance to win the second game. This logic apply to all the combo decks that the new master rule made possible.  When playing against Eldlich your goal is to banish all 3 golden lords. Either with Call by the Grave or Reincarnation. Enemy Controler and Crackdown are really good to bait your opponent's traps and take the Golden Lord so that his traps second effects are dead. Prohibition and Evenly Matched can very much win the game, or at least change for a Judgment or a Golden Land Forever! which puts you in an advantageous  position once this deck can burn for 4000 much quicker and he will not be able to negate your cards.  The Cyber Dragon 1 card engine is really good to out your opponent's Apollousa and gives you a 2400 body. It doesn't start a chain so that's nothing to negate. Honest can be unfortunate sometimes but you will run out of resources earlier so you need a bit of extra damage to push for game faster. Scapegoat, Bouquet and Enemy Controller are also there to help you finishing the game.  Finally some people run Extravagance over Desires, but i don't think that's a good idea. You have a 50% chance of drawing a starter turn 1 while you have a 0.1% of banishing all of them with desires and a 2.9% chance of banishing all Lycoris or all Reincarnation. While Extravagance will 100% banish your Extra Deck cards so you can't rely on them when needed. The chance of banishing an important piece to the Scapegoat Combo is 90%. The Extra Deck cards are indeed not that much used but don't think they are not important. Banish Chimeratech and your Cyber Dragon is dead, Banish Borreload or Ningirsu and you don't have an out to certain cards. There are a lot of Specific cards like Trisbanea that you would just use against backrow decks, but it doesn't mean they are not important.  When building a control deck that's based on a popular engine i feel like there's no sense on explaining how the engine works. It has been working the same way for years. The most important decisions are the non engine cards and how they relate to the new meta game. So, i don't recommend using Chain Summoning, this is not an FTK deck and that card is just a brick in most cases. I'm not using Solemns because Lightning Storm is really popular this format and you don't want to set a lot of backrow. Almost all our backrow is chainable and you can go second and rely on hand traps dodging Storm. Even Going First Called by the Grave can negate Ash or other hand traps that bothers you. The deck also doesn't have a lot of cards on the field, so Evenly Matched doesn't do a lot against it.  Overall, I think it's a really fun deck to play and it can perform better than people are expecting because they have no cards on side deck to counter your plays."

It's important to keep Guru and The Hidden City on the field to keep your control of the game and search out your Subterror cards. The deck doesn't really use the extra deck, for this reason it's quite easy to get away with extravagance and get the easy draw power."

There are 2 ways to play this deck you can fill the field then go into heatleo or pyro to obliterate your opponent or you can play just blasting your opponent with your back row and monster affects. I play one or the other depending on what type of deck I am up against.  Here is an example of a combo  1 activate pot of desires  2 normal summon foxy  3 Special Summon (now will be refered to as SS) fowl  4 SS balelynx wth foxy  5 SS gazelle  6 send spinny to GY with gazelle's affect  7 play salamangreat sanctuary  8 SS spinny  9activate foolish burial and send jack jaguar  10 activate jack jaguar and return foxy to the deck and SS  11 SS apollousa with spinny, gazelle, fowl, and jack jaguar  12 activate will of salamangreat to summon fowl  13 SS sulight wolf with balelynx and foxy  14 activate salamangreat circle to get meer  15 use meer's affect to summon it in zone of sunlight  16 activate sunlight to add gazelle for next turn  17 SS heatleo  18 SS heatleo with heatleo  now you have a very strong board built up and even if it comes down (which would be very hard) you could build it up again that is what I like about salamangreat no matter how bad they get hit they always get back up.  &nbsp;"

Like, either keep Destiny HERO - Malicous at 2 or 3! Make up your mind!  &nbsp;  Also, I got a new laptop recently, so I can make some deck profiles more often. This is a HERO deck I made after the banlist for Master Rule 5 was dropped. I replaced Destiny HERO - Celestial with Destiny HERO - Drawhand, because I've gotten more use out of Drawhand overall. Not to say that Celestial is bad, I just don't wind up using it very often.  &nbsp;  I decided to name this deck ""You Say Run,"" after one of the songs from the Boku No Hero Academia soundtrack. My strategy for this deck is pretty simple--either go first and set up a lockdown with Destiny HERO - Plasma, or go second and OTK my opponent.

Pros: <ul>  	<li>Still has normal access to the consistent Marincess link climbing engine, able to end on Great Bubble Reef or Wonder Heart with 3 equips in one turn with most hands.</li>  	<li>The deck only locks into WATER, thus you have access to many great WATER extenders such as Aqua Spirit, Crusadia Arboria, Fishborg Launcher, Crystron Halqifibrax, and more!</li>  	<li>Capability to generate tons of card advantage due to the self recycling nature of Marincess and the draw power of Great Bubble Reef. As long as you don't get OTK'd, you can still rebuild a broken board!</li>  	<li>Decent protection with the ability to easily make a towers-like boss monster, and good disruption with Marincess Wave, basically an archetype impermanence.</li>  	<li>Strong recent WATER synchro releases that can easily be gone into, such as Adamancipator Risen - Dragite and Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna.</li>  	<li>Many possible combo paths to get into Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier.</li>  	<li>Turns out some of the best XYZs are WATER too, such as Abyss Dweller. The Bahamut Shark + Toad package is a good option too.</li> </ul> Cons: <ul>  	<li>Fragile deck, can play around a couple disruptions with the right hand but still easily stopped.</li>  	<li>Relies heavily on managing your Link arrows, place things in the wrong zones and your combos can be cut short.</li>  	<li>Gets absolutely dumpstered by Nibiru, as the standard Marincess link climb puts you way above the Nibiru threshold.</li>  	<li>Relies heavily on the field spell. It's easily searched with Sea Angel and also easily retrieved when destroyed, but it'll be under fire quite a bit and hard to get back when banished (but not impossible due to Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna).</li>  	<li>Has a hard time against an established unbreakable board going second, as the true extensions of the Marincess board going into Synchros and such are usually only doable on your second turn unless your hand is just that good.</li> </ul> Synergies to keep in mind: <ul>  	<li>Great Bubble Reef gets really big when you banish a lot of things. Many monsters in this deck banish as part of a cost, effect, or condition. Aqua Spirit and Scrypton banish a target to summon themselves, Mandarin and Sea Archiver banish themselves upon leaving the field after their extension, etc. Also, banishing your opponent's cards counts too, hence Trishula immediately buffs Great Bubble Reef by up to 1800 ATK.</li>  	<li>If you use backrow removal in your deck, use Cosmic Cyclone. Not because banishing spells and traps makes them harder to get back, but because it gives you higher chances of Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna's ability to summon from the deck to be live.</li>  	<li>Deep Sea Princess Prima Donna can get back something you banished with Pot of Desires upon leaving the field, at least according to how EDOPRO rules it.</li> </ul> KEEP IN MIND:  This version of the deck focuses on the combos of the deck. In order to make it more competitive and replacing some of the cards with hand traps and the like, replace copies of extenders that are heavily reliant on having another resource to extend off of, such as Pascalus, Aqua Spirit, etc. Good things to sub in are Called by the Grave, Infinite Impermanence, and your favorite hand traps."

The main combo I wished to achieve was set 2 pass, with portal and a properly-summoned Phul in grave, and to do so, all we need is a Hagith summon. Scrapping bad cards, we're left with 12 main-deck archetype cards, not running any more megaliths than absolutely necessary to facilitate the combo every time. The Godo engine with 2 Glove and Onomatopoeia alongside 3 Magileine and 1 Petingcessoeur allows us to summon Gallant Granite with 80% of hands. A small Dragma package allows us to extend upon these plays, getting a negate, a search and/or a pop depending on what you send.  We pass to our opponent, watch them develop their monsters, using traps if under dark ruler, or using Phul to summon Bethor to pop, and depending on how broken your hand is, I:P'ing into either Apollousa or Unicorn for further disruption. Once they've failed to build a formidable board, we summon out father Phaleg and hit face for lethal."

I personally consider this as a swarm deck because of one card: Eternal Soul.  Eternal Soul is a card where on either players turn, can summon a Dark Magician from your hand or graveyard.  Then, Eye of Timaeus will allow you to summon either the following: Dark Cavalry or Dark Magician the Dragon Knight.  For powering up all of your DARK attribute monsters, Wee witch's will do just that.  I also have played this deck on Yu-Gi-Oh! Dueling Nexus and a similar deck in Yu-Gi-Oh!

Fuse your HEROes into the one that's going to save the day and strike down the villain. The wide range of monster effects and spells means you can constantly mix up and change strategies.  Opponent got a high powered monster beating you down? Not to worry, with your wide range of HEROes, use <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> to take their monster and fuse it into your own powerful warrior to beat them down.  You also have the Masked HEROes ready to swap in to bring in their own effects. Don't forget your change and super poly cards are all quick play, meaning you can summon numerous monsters at almost any phase of the game!  Try it out and find what combinations work well for you, a couple recommendations:  Summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a>, and then play <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> to summon <a data-name=""Masked HERO Acid"">Masked HERO Acid</a> to completely wipe your opponents field.  Use a light monster to summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Elemental HERO Sunrise</a>, then play <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> to summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO The Shining"">Elemental HERO The Shining</a>, giving you two  monsters on the field, which each get a boos from Sunrise, and The Shining gets a further ATK boost from your banished monsters. If that wasn't enough, when the Shining is destroyed you can add the cards you banished back to your hand.  If your opponent has summoned numerous monsters, fusion summon <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a>. Trinity is unable to attack directly but can make up to three attacks on monsters and on the turn its summoned his attack doubles to 5000. Combine this with <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"">Elemental HERO Honest Neos</a> to raise up to 7500, then if you have The Warrior Returning Alive you can repeat the process to boost up to 10000, and attack for massive damage."

Double Plaguespreader to for Halquifibrax. Always, Always make Chaos Ruler first because he dumps 4 and gets a search that can be utilized with Popperup. Popperup can get cards out of hand and Uni-Zombie is a great opener. Best normal summon is probably Lumina since she can discard herself and revive herself while also setting up the graveyard. Mezuki is always graveyard fodder. Small Block Dragon engine to allow for going into Dingirsu to give the negations some protection. Long combos but it's not like a specific line because of Lightsworns so it's more like just discard and see what happens. Plaguespreader plus any level-4 for a charge warrior which is a free draw then that gives you an easy Crystal Wing. This deck has next to no recursion, loses to Nibiru, Ash Blossom, and heavy negate boards so feel free to use the side deck for cards like Dark Ruler No More and Super Poly. Have fun spitting out heavy negations. Even with brick hands during my testing the worst board I came out with a  3 counter Apollousa so there's defenitely choke points but the deck is very very conistent due to Block Dragon's existance. Side Deck is all going second cards and anti Hand Traps. Revival Golem is just Block Dragon food and potentially a free summon off of any Lightsworn Card or could even be used with Plaguespreader if you have no cards in hand.  I am very open to suggestions and differences to the extra deck. I personally think it's tight but the only cards that aren't preforming are Curious and Saryuja, while Saryuja has gotten me to special summon Zombie Master for more extension."

Combo is kinda consistent, because its only <strong>Deadreef+any lv4</strong>. So we play 3 Deadreef (dumps ""big fish""), 3 Beautunaful Princess + 1 One for One, 2-3 Summoner Monk (searches Deadreef and fulfilling the combo but needs spell in hand), therefore we play roughly 9 Deadreef and the rest is just lv4 water extender.  The combo is we summon Dugares (on extra zone) with Deadreef (after sending big fish) + any lv4, use Dugares revive big fish, use big fish discard 1, ss 4 fishes from deck (preferably every copy of Deadreef in our deck as it provides us draw from GY), make Bahamut Shark ss Toadally, make Gallant Granite search Adaman Researcher (or Nibiru if we draw Researcher), ss Researcher, make F0 with Gallant + Bahamut, make Halqifibrax with Researcher + Dugares, ss O-Lion, make Crocodragon with O-Lion + big fish, use Crocodragon draw and chain O-Lion ss lv3 wind machine token. Now you can use Deadreef draw from GY, making us draw 2 in total from our combo.

Cons: 2 cards combo, follow up play aint too good, Dugares effect skips your next main phase 1, Beautunaful Princess misses timing if summoned with White Mirror.  Cards to think of: Silent Angler (good lv4 water extender but conflicts with Researcher), other sharks (most of it aint too good), other synchro plays (I put the example on side deck)."

It is Consistent and Durable against the Meta.,"This is a version of Salads (Salamangreats) that doesn’t have Apollousa for those that can’t afford to buy a card(s) that expensive. This deck is very consistent and it’s durability is crazy good.  The main strategy is to set up a defensive board first turn to help with disrupting or going for the OTK on your next turn. If you’re going Second, You can play still play defensive, still go for the OTK, or remove their board and have some offense but not an OTK.  &nbsp;  Depending on who you are facing and/or what you have in your hand determines what 1 of 3 ways that you can will set up your board. Regardless of either, always try to get the Rage or Roar if You did not draw into them.  1) Get Bagooska our in defense mode. Yes this will effect you as well, but you can easily work around it because most of your Salad monsters effects activate in grave and once you have your Links, you don’t have to worry  2) Bring our Abyss Dweller to disrupt your opponent from activating effects from grave.  3) Bring our Transcode Talker and co-link with Wolf. If you send Roar or Rage to grave, don’t Reincarnate Wolf until you bring him back out with Transcode Talker. If you are getting Roar, use Wolfs effect not Roar’s so that it doesn’t get banished yet. I would only use Roar’s effect if I reincarnate a different Salad Link or if I have both Rage and Roar in grave. Which in that case, get Rage with Wolf’s effect and then Roar via reincarnation.  I have Knightmare Unicorn for those monsters that can’t be destroyed by battle/card effects.  As for the side deck, use what you have that is good against the meta. I’m gonna place what I am able to use.  I don’t use Knightmare Phoenix or Hiita because I found myself barely going into them. Sometimes it wasn’t helpful or it would’ve disruptive to me to bring them out, so I took them out and don’t regret it."

The spellbook engine improves the consistency of the deck and the kaijus can eliminate big threats on the board. Mystic mine is used here to stall when you don't have a good play and handtraps to control the board. There can only be one is a useful trap against many matchups like pure Blue Eyes or Dark magician.  My rating:  Attack: 3/5  Defense: 5/5  Consistency: 4/5  Strong Against: Decks with only 1 or 2 types, Gren Maju, Dark Magician  Weak Against: Virus Control, Nekroz  Small combos:  Normal summon Aleister (or use Magical Meltdown to search him)  Activate his effect, get an invocation into the hand  Link Aleister into Almiraj  Link Almiraj into Gardna  Fusion summon Purgatrio with Aleister and Almiraj in the GY, banishing them  Add Aleister from the banished zone to hand by shuffling invocation into deck  Spellbook combo:  Activate Spellbook of secrets, bring blue boy into hand  Normal summon blue boy, bring Spellbook of knowledge into hand  Send blue boy to the GY with Spellbook of knowledge's effect and draw 2 cards  &nbsp;  This is a really fun deck if you play it correctly.

I built all three options for the TCG, but if u play Online or TCG/OCG, there is a fourth option which includes the Predaplant-Dragun-Engine. Just include DM, RE and R.E.F in the Main-, and Predaplant and Dragun in the Extradeck. (Kick out 3 of the equipspells)  The other two options obviously are Exodia FTK, and Apex Avian Lockdown. Exodia is of course the most inconsistent but still works very well. Apex avian is pretty consistent but i like Zexal best for beeing the most consistent.  Strategy is simple: Summon two samurai, isolde, battle shogun, gateway, skulldeat, generate plus, build a board of naturias, cristalwing, apollousa and zexal."

As result this deck doesn't include usual Genex staples like Genex Blastfan, Genex Ally Duradark, or allure of darkness. However, the deck does function way better than other Genex decks despite this.  So the main focus of this deck is to build a board with a few negates, and the way it achieves this is through double summon and the symphonic warrior engine to give you an extra normal summon and get more monsters on the field while maintaining a good had advantage, such as through searching Genex monsters with Genex monsters and T.G. hyper librarian. Things to keep in mind about this deck is that it's combos end on Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon almost all the time, it fills up the board fast, and it summons Mecha phantom beast O-lion a lot, so be careful when you use Mecha Phantom Beast O-lion's token effect because using it early may mess up your plays.  You can use Genex Recycled to copy a name of a Genex monster in the grave, preferably Genex turbo, then use Machine Duplication to summon two of those monsters from the deck, which if you copied Genex turbo, you can instantly make Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier.  Genex power planner is there only if you have an additional normal summon, to easily synchro summon Martial Metal Marcher with phantom beast O-lion, or if you brick and have no combo starters in your hand, which happens on occasions, but not nearly as often as one might think.  Genex Turbo can search out Genex Oracle which can then special summon itself, allowing you to link summon Crystron Halqifibrax.  Genex Ally Birdman can allow you to get an extra tuner on the field and allow you to re-use the effects of Genex Turbo, Undine, and Power Planner, increasing hand advantage, especially if you have an additional normal summon sense Genex monsters don't have hard once per turn effects.  And to get the most out of Genex Undine if you can only normal summon once, follow this guide: Normal summon it to send Crystron Phoenix to the grave and search for Genex controller. Banish Crystron Pheonix to summon a token and special summon link spider with it, then use link spider's effect to summon Genex Controller and link summon Crystron Halqifibrax to special summon a tuner. You can further extend this combo by special summoning Mecha phantom beast O-lion with Halqifibrax to synchro summon Accel Synchron and special summon a token, then send Jet Synchron to the grave to decrease it's level by 1 and synchro summon F.A. dawn dragster. then you can summon Jet Synchron and link summon for Auroradon, tribute one of its tokens and itself to summon another phantom beast O-lion from the deck, and then synchro summon Borreload Savage Dragon and equip Auroradon for a total of two negates on the field and a 4050 beater.  Pot of Avarice is probably the deck's only form of recovery, so use it wisely.  The side deck is pretty open, but most of the cards in there are for going second sense this deck dies off of a single negate, so feel free to add cards you feel are better suited for it."

","Lego Adamancipators focuses on the Board Building and recursion potential of Earth Monsters, using Block Golem and all Earth Main Deck monsters (besides Nibiru, but that's a hand-trap anyway) to create card advantage through the Excavation mechanic. <ol>  	<li>Alongside the obvious triple copies of each Adamancipator Tuner, I use half the GoGoGo engine, Gigas and Dwarf, for their natural ability to recur themselves from the grave when combined, coupled with their rank 4 status to not only make a Gallant Granite, but also pitch to Doki Doki to cheat Analyzer from the Deck. They can also be used to make Abyss Dweller, which can come in very handly against certain decks such as Eldlich.</li>  	<li>I use two Block Dragon, because it's a strong card to open with, possibly getting all 3 Tuners from the deck (though most often, grabbing Seeker and Researcher, plus a Gigantes to extend), and running two takes into account a Called By or DD Crow, allowing a possible Union Carrier or Gallant to fetch the second if it fails.</li>  	<li>Another staple, Gigantes is just a very good card for extending, or getting a second level 4 to make Gallant Granite and begin my plays, but it's also a brick on Excavation, so I only run 2.</li>  	<li>2 Koa'ki Meiru Guardians allow for an early protection from Nibiru, if they're excavated. I'm playing around with running 3, but deck space is relatively tight, given how important it is to open with a Tuner.</li>  	<li>Block Golem, my own little pet tech and one of the focuses of the deck, turns an excavation from a +1 into a +2, which is absolutely incredible, turns Adamancipator Signs into a ""bring back 2 monsters from your grave"", and matches the Tuners for a +1 when cheated out by Doki Doki: even better, if both Gigas and Dwarf are in the grave, by resurrecting only one of them and another monster, the other can also be brought out by it's effect, becoming a +3, so I run 3, to maximize the chance of excavating it. The card does come with a caveat, however: in order to use Block Golem's effect, all monsters in the grave MUST be Earth Attribute. Because of this, zone placement becomes important, as I don't want to send any of my Link Monsters to the grave until I'm ready to commit to my final board, or have enough resources that Block Golem is no longer needed. With the current build, that isn't a terribly difficult thing to pull off, but it's something I always need to keep in mind while starting a combo.</li>  	<li>Barrier Statue of the Drought is part of an interesting combo, which can not only be excavated, but also be searched at the end on a combo by resurrecting an unused Tuner with Signs (usually a Researcher or Seeker that Halqifibrax brought out, and couldn't activate). The best example of this is a line of play I shoot for when I've opened an Adamancipator Signs, Researcher, and one other rock monster (Seeker also works here, if you open a Doki Doki along with it to bring Analyzer out.) At minimum, by starting with the Rock Monster, then specialing Researcher, so long as I hit the excavation, I'll have 3 rock monsters on the field. I can link Researcher and one of them off to create Halqifibrax, summoning Seeker from the deck (or Researcher, if Seeker was first), then link Seeker and the normaled monster into I:P, and link those two into Mekk Knight Crusadia Avramax, who now cannot be destroyed by card effects because it was link summoned with I:P Masquerena. Finally, I use Signs to bring back Seeker (or Researcher), putting Barrier on top, and excavate Barrier to the field. This line of play locks the opponent into only Special Summoning Earth Monsters, and they can't just normal summon and attack the barrier to lift that restriction, because Avramax protects it, and Avramax cannot be outed by any Kaiju except Kumonga (who is not normally played), so long as Barrier is on the field. This board can end on <em>far</em> more, as well, as that was considering the bare minimum of play: with skillful and careful play, one can viably create a board of Avramax, Block Dragon, Dragite/Savage (Dragite only if you think your opponent may have a Raigeki effect, so that your spell/trap negate is protected by Block Dragon), Barrier Statue of the Drought, and an Apollousa. Given, one or more of those may be missing, depending on excavations and the strength of the opening hand, but I've managed to assemble that board several times.</li>  	<li>3 Cosmic Cyclone, because in the situation that I go second, I don't like scooping to Zombie World/Rivalry, Summon Limit, There Can Only Be One, etc.</li>  	<li>Double Summon is another contentious tech, and one I haven't fully committed to as of yet. I only run two, at the moment, because I never want to see two of them, and many times, the card will not be needed: however, when I do open it, it can be a life saver after my opponent stops my starter, and can also unbrick hands that completely lack a Doki Doki or Tuner, because most of those hands are mostly level 4 Rocks, which I can summon two of the make a Gallant Granite, search Block Dragon, then banish two in my hand and the one that was dumped into the grave for Granite to summon Block Dragon. Then, I link the two off for I:P, grabbing Researcher, Seeker, and any level 4 I'm fine with banishing in order to bring Block Dragon back out, banishing Gallant, its other material, and the level 4 in my hand, so that Researcher can special herself, followed by Seeker, because Researcher is out. Then, it's into the combo, with a hand that had effectively 0 combo pieces.</li>  	<li>Yes, I will still effectively lose to Dark Ruler No More, but that's just how Adamancipator is.</li>  	<li>Finally, just getting into a small bit of math, the deck runs 15 excavation targets. Given that 12 of those cards- all of them except Doki Doki- are suboptimal to open with, it's a decent ratio, at a soft 30% of the deck, probability putting it at 1.5, or 1-2 cards average per opening hand. Meanwhile, using that number, after taking 5 cards for the opening hand, there'll be a roughly 38.6% chance to excavate one of those monsters on my first excavation (13.5/35), running roughly 1.93 excavatable monsters per excavation, a very balanced ratio that, most times, will allow me a choice between two of them. So far, this ratio has kept my hands and excavations relatively consistent, but it's still an ongoing process to perfect it.</li> </ol>"

Additional you should play with a convertible Side deck because people will make you go first if they know what you are playing so put some Solemn Jugment's and Strike's as well as Torrential Tribute's and Summon Limit's or Gozen Matches.  Another thing that you can do is swap out the one Yosenju Izna and the two Yosenju Secret Move for three copies of Superpolymerization and obviously put some targets for it in the Extra Deck like Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, Mudragon of the Swamp, World Chalice Guardragon Almarduke and Diplexer Chimera."

Just wanted to propose a Cyber Dragon deck more ""Meta Friendly"", not only a pure Second Turn FTK, because going first, nowadays, can be a better option if you can control the board.  &nbsp;  It keeps its power to OTK but with just more control.  &nbsp;  If you're going first:  Try to discard ASAP Herz, so you can get a Cyber Dragon. You can use galaxy soldier most of the time (prior) or Nachster (but be carefull with this one cause you won't be able to summon predaplant verte nor pleiades).  Summon Nova, bring back cyber dragon, try to get a third lvl 5 on the board (Nachster for exemple, when you special summon it, you can special summon a cyber dragon from GY). If you're T1 with overload fusion, get Rampage Dragon, use its effect to send Turtle to the GY along with Herz if you hadn't already, and then summon Pleiades with Cyber Dragon + Rampage dragon.  If you haven't overload, summon predaplant before using Herz first effect (which you should not use T1) or Nachster effect, and summon Rampage Dragon last, sending Turtle.  Try to get Cyber Repair Plant fast, so you can get another Light Monster (most of the time Galaxy Soldier, or whatever monster your hand is lacking, like Nachster or Cyber Dragon or even Herz for discard effect). If you haven't any Cyber Dragon monster in the GY, summon Almiraj to send one. This last one, if you have no other option, can be kept on board to protect one of your monster on opponent's turn, but it's not a priority move.  If you have a Core in hand, it will be your prior normal summon, to get Revsystem or Emergency or Repair Plant.  &nbsp;  Next, it's all about surviving the opponent's first turn without loosing too much. HT like Ghost and Ogre can help, Infinity, Pleiades, and you can skip the Battle Phase with Turtle in the GY.  &nbsp;  Next, try to summon another Rampage Dragon by any means (along with Sieger), so you can:  &nbsp;  -clean the opponent's Spell/Trap board.  -Sieger's effect on it  -Attack three times with 4200 ATK.  &nbsp;  Don't forget to use infinity to get rid of an opponent monster. You can use Pleiades too, to clean up a bit. Don't forget Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon, you don't need any Polymerization to summon him, and you can tribute an ennemy link monster (most of the time). Use Fortress when you're using Jizukiru if you can't do anything else (but normally, Infinity's here).  Here are two replays showing a ""good"" going first match:  &nbsp;  <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyTuAC276Q0</a> <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJI0M5HT5C4&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>  Going second, is the same as T3 before, Infinity to clean, Rampage Dragon to clean and burst, Sieger to help doing this.  Here are three more videos showing a FTK (almost for one, he surrended at T3 :p) going second.  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx7x3khr5pM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hry65VGHXMc&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> (this one is against a player)  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB5i9QS_ajo&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> (against evil eye, he surrended :p)  &nbsp;  Q/A:  -Why three Galaxy Soldiers? Cause it increases the prob to draw it at the start, and the third one isn't a dead weight.  -Why no Super Polymerization: Because i'm focusing on going first here, so this card isn't really helpfull, and i don't have monsters using this (i have overload and predaplant, it's enough)  -Why no Ash and Blossom, and putting Ghost Ogre? I know that Blossom is better, but you can't discard it (fie monster), Ghost Ogre is a Light one so it can be used in multiple ways.  -Why Reasoning? Well, this card is a gamble, but the deck uses a wide variety of monsters with differents lvl: they can all be usefull on board, and the chances that the opponent (especially going first) picks the good one are really low.   Try not to use it first, as it can discard usefull spells, but you have at least 2 copies of each, so it shouldn't be a problem.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So i hope you enjoyed this presentation, and that you'l enjoy this deck online, if you have any feedback, feel free to comment :)  &nbsp;  Have Fun!  &nbsp;  Updated 25/04/2020: -1 overload, + 1 Super Pol (TCG only), -1 revsystem, +1 evenly matched, -1 cyber eternity, - 1 auroradon, +1 earth golem, +1 mudragon,"

At this point you triggered  the second effect of Wise strix that makes you set a Rank up magic spell from your deck, so you set Rank up magic soul shave force.  Step 3: Now you use the effect of Zephyros from you GY by returning one card on your field to your hand (usually Black whirlwind, Pinpoint landing or Bora the spear) and special summon Union carrier  Step 4: Special summon Simorgh, bird of sovreign using Wise strix and Force strix as materials.  Step 5: Use the effect of union carrier to equip the Simorgh with myst valley Thunderbird from your deck and then use the set Rank up magic soul shave force to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity. Attivate its effect and absorb union carrier.  Step 6: In the end phase use the effect of Simorgh to special summon Myst Valley Apex Avian from you deck in a zone Simorgh points to and entry your opponent becomes Angry while you negate everything he does!  This was the basic guaranteed combo, but you can also end your turn with mother addizionale monsters like Borreload Savage Dragon and Time thief redoer to improve your negation power. I've also put 3x of Lightning storm to prevent disadvantage by starting second and to put out your opponent' spell/traps cards in order to have the conditions to use Simorgh's effect in the End Phase. Obviously, you can substitute it with other cards from you side deck like Crossout designator, ash blossom and/or Nibiru As Wells. The motivativation because I pur 2x of Pinpoint landing is quite simple: draw power on your turn and the opponent's turn when you attivate the effect of Myst Valley Thunderbird and because it's a continuos spell that you can make go black to your hand by the effect of Zephyros."

One thing the deck struggles with is breaking boards, because cards like Evenly and Super Poly are side decked you can struggle going second in the first game. Your win condition is using cards like Subterror Final battle to beat on your opponent's weak board. I play tested this deck today and won 3/3 matches, every opponent rage quit. I had continuously looped Guru flip effect using The Hidden City to always have a Fiendess in hand, along with other hand traps the opponents weren't able to build boards."

Get him back on the field by destroying Cursed Eldland (and sending a trap to the GY, using the End Phase effect to set an Eldlixir on the field) or a trap card (and effect in GY for this trap).  &nbsp;  Most of the time, you'll have Eldich 3500 ATK almost invulnerable and some negates with traps/Mechaba/HT.  &nbsp;  Going second is almost the same.  &nbsp;  Tips: If you have two Eldlich and the opponent has no trap or HT (or if you're almost sure), you can Summon Rail Canon Gustav, effect (-2000), summon Rail Canon Juggernaut, effect (6000 ATK) and ending (it can attack 3 times on ennemy's monsters.)

Yes, yes, I know. Cyberdarks are infamous for being real bad for many reasons. Upon further inspection, however, one would notice that its speed and overall playstyle are the main offenders to its bad reputation. This build aims to patch up these problems by incorporating play stoppers and disruptions to slow the game down a bit, as making the archetype faster would just hinder its consistency and performance. The use of a small Shaddoll engine does synergise well with the deck, and offers a lot of value for resources. If you are interested in knowing why these specific tech cards were chosen or how the strategy works in practice, feel free to watch the video posted!  This deck is part of a YouTube series called <em>TRULY TRASH? -</em> videos based around trash tier Yu-Gi-Oh! archetypes. Each video contains replays, analyses, and deck techs as well as the reasoning behind choosing such!

Borreload Savage Dragon is in the deck list as well, it's almost 100% needed but its expensive so you could replace a few Rokkets with Rokket Synchron and replace Savage with Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss which can simulate the Negate situation although slightly harder to pull off. Hopefully both combo replays reflect how strong this deck is with its end boards going first or second.  This obviously isn't my first Rokket list as i'm always adjusting and adapting it to what i feel is good or is needed against the meta. Like all combo heavy decks you can very easily be interrupted by Nibiru or have all you work come to naught by Dark Ruler No More which is sadly something you can't really work around. Knightmare Phoenix is your closest out to Mystic Mine without the Side Deck, hoping you can use enough materials to have the same amount of monsters as the opponent to get the Phoenix effect.  Expect a few more Rokket Deck Lists in the future as Eternity Code brings a new card in Noctovision Dragon which is a great extender for this deck and its only a Common."

This deck can brick a lot, as with any dec","If you are like me, than you like fusion decks, combo decks, or top tier decks. Invoked Shaddoll is kind of a hard deck to play well, seeing as how there are so many options you can choose from depending on your starting hand (if you don’t brick, of course). The deck is also very good at stopping your opponent from playing the game, going first or second. For going first, your main goal is to end on a board of Apollousa for three, Mechaba, Winda, and either a Raidjin or Caliga (preferably Raidjin because than you can’t get super-polyd, if I’m not mistaken). But if you brick, which is easy to do with this deck, your secondary goal is to at least bring out Winda, as it is unaffected by your opponents card effects, and they can only special summon once per turn. For going second, you can do one of two things (from what I’ve learned with the deck): 1. If you have Aleister, which is by far the best card in the deck, you can normal summon him, activate his effect to add Invocation from your deck to your hand, than link him off for Almiraj, than use Invocation to fuse Aleister in the grave and Almiraj (both get banished) to summon Purgatrio, which gains 400 attack for each monster and can attack all monsters once each, and 2. Do the standard combo (Aleister + Wendi/Squamata + Damage Juggler), but instead of Apollousa, you end on a Borrelsword instead, which is a lot riskier, but will more than likely kill your opponent."

Pegasus places Zenith on s/t zone as continuous spell, use Zenith in s/t zone ss another Pegasus, ss Verte for Rainbow Neos or Utopia Double for OTK (you can play 2 Double or Nothing because our win condition is very limited).  Crystal lineup: Rainbow and Rainbow Dark Dragon (for chaos play, since you need to play 2 so your Zenith always can activate from s/t zone), 3 Pegasus (your main starter, a wind too for Miracle Fusion play), 1 Crystal Beast Tiger (another fodder if u run out of Pegasus), Crystal Promise (ss Crystal beast from s/t zone), 3 Crystal Bond (adds Pegasus and can place Zenith on s/t zone like Pegasus), 3 Rainbow Bridge (adds Bond or Promise, not once per turn), that's all mainly just to turbo Pegasus out, making us running roughly 9 starters.  Neos lineup: 1 Neos (material), 3 Neos Fusion (Verte target, can be Rainbow Neos fodder to spin backrows too while giving it protection ), Miracle Fusion (Verte target, luckily Great Tornado works with Pegasus to complement our go 2nd strat).  The rest are just handtraps and kaijus (with light/dark attribute, kaiju can be free lv8 too) with some breaking board cards.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/MBj3LFu.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Super consistent 1 card starter, able to break most of the meta board with non-destruction non-targeting play, can put in big damage and even OTK, strategy is not very well known among player.  Cons: Red-Eyes Dragoon play is better than Rainbow Neos, cant always put lethal damage in 1 turn, going first is very bad (needs side deck or more extra deck choices).  Cards to think of: Ruby Carbuncle (good extender, but not a starter and needs another card to be online), other Crystal s/t (most of them are bad and have ridiculous requirement), Effect Veiler (good light target for chaos play but we can easily send another light like Neos to GY, Imperm is better too)."

Board wipe loop AND OTK, with a scrap package, and True King of All Calamities.","Machina Trains. A stupid OTK deck with a solid grind game and a good (if not amazing) plan for going first. The deck is still a blind second deck. I ended on 41 cards, which feels all right. It might help reduce seeing bricks like Scrap Golem, but more importantly, the deck is refined to the point that all of the cards feel truly essential.  We're running 0 hand traps. Instead we have a 9 going second cards, 3 Dark Ruler No More, 3 Kaijus, and 3 Lightning Storm. Dark Ruler is now in the main deck. It makes sense, and since other people are doing it I might as well, you need to be able to break through Adimancipator somehow. The Kaijus are notable, since we're running Level 10 Machine monsters. That means you can search Kaijus off of Urgent Schedule when using it as fodder in the scrap combo going first, you can use Anger Knuckle if it's in your GY to special summon it or a level 10 from your hand, you can send it to the GY for the special summon on Machina Fortress, and most importantly you can use multiple copies to make Rank 10s, important in trains.  We have 8 different starters, and a strange variety of them. Going first, Machina Metalcruncher is the most important. You can use it to make True King of All Calamities while searching a Bullet Train, which is already better than Night Express. It can also search different combo pieces (with luck). We need 2 so we can search a second copy with Megaform to make Ranks 9s, but you can also use Flying Pegasus to make True King. Notably, the effect still works if special summoned by Flying Pegasus.  Flying Pegasus is technically a starter, and is an okay normal summon to help make rank 10s and start combos. But its real purpose is to be searched off of Revolving Switchyard. The second copy just means you can still use Switchyard to pull it out of the deck if you see one in your hand but have a better normal summon. We still need 1 Night Express Knight, to search off of the Switchyard and start plays.  The last 3 are Scrap Recycler. Recycler is insane with Machina Citadel and Urgent Schedule, going first or second. With Gizmek Orochi and Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion he's a one card Borrelsword Dragon with Gizmek Orochi as def position fodder and extra damage. Going first he's an easy Apollousa. Going second, you have Urgent Schedule for that board, plus Machina Citadel. This is lower end for the deck as well. You can play through multiple negations and still pull this off as well, since these are 1 or 2 card combos in the hand. This is the main starter of the deck, and generally our want to use him to send Machina Fortress.  All 6 of the Trains special summons are here. You need 3 each of Derricrane and Bullet Train so that you can find easy level 10s with Machina Metalcruncher. Derricrane is my favourite, put that under Super Dora... Mmm yummy. But my favourite Train, by far, are the 2 copies of Machina Citadel. This is a combo piece, a free-floating effect for your rank 10s, and a reasonable line of disruption all at the same time. You need at least 2 copies, for 2 reasons. 1 is so that you can loop Citadels, forcing players to banish your Citadel or destroy it twice in one turn to get rid of it, and giving you a board wipe every turn. The second, more important reason,is so that if you've pulled a Citadel out of the GY with its effect or Flying Pegasus, you can use Machina Megaform to pull out the second citadel and make a Rank 10 (with a cool floating effect to summon Citadel on destruction).  2 Machina Fortress are necessary. You can make rank 7s with Flying Pegasus, but being able to make Rank 7s with Machina Megaform and Fortress on the field is essential to ending with more than just a Fortress on the field. Don't get me wrong, its a reasonably obnoxious beat stick, but by making Dacossack you can go into Auroradon to make Borreload Savage Dragon. The fact that this card is not once per turn is insane, so long as you have machine monsters with lots of stars in your hand you can keep summoning it, which is how you make some of your link plays, and part of how you set up Anger Knuckle.  Machina Irradiator and Machina Megaform are a combo that grabs any machina out of your deck, and are common targets for Machina Redeployment. Megaform is the more impressive - it gives a Fortress you're using as a beatstick a cool floating effect, helps make Dingirsu with 3 Materials going first, and actually has applications so long as you've got access to Fortress, whereas Irradiator is basically just used to destroy your own cards for Citadel, and to pull Megaform out of the GY to make Xyz plays.  The last 9 cards are card advantage engines. Machina Redeploment is a free citadel on the field, and lets you set up hands with more Machina cards for Machina link combos. Switchyard is free special summons, and can even do it on your opponent's turn, though limited copies of Flying Pegasus does hamper its usefulness slightly. It also serves as another way to fix you hand and start combo, like Redeployment. I've already talked about the insane advantage you can get off of Urgent Schedule. The card is busted.  You can add a Halqifibrax combo with Jet Synchron, Deskbot 001, Halqifibrax, and Herald of the Arc Light. This just gives you an alternative route out of Scrap Recycler, which is good going first. I tried the package, didn't like it, and now I'm back to this list."

Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?,"Pros:  -Strong blowout effects  -Decent grind game  -Explosive strength  Cons:  -Can brick  -Don't have too much choice over which gameplan (Metaphys or Thunder Dragon), unless you open really well  -Can be slow to get going  &nbsp;  The deck overall is quite fun. It's an updated version of my prior variant, except with a heavier focus on the Metaphys portion. It makes use of cards like Aloof Lupine, Lightray Grepher, Crossout Designator and Gold Sarcophagus to banish the cards it wants from the deck to access different gameplans. I'm also utilizing Crystrons, since both Quan and Citree work rather well with the deck, since they can either banish monsters from gy to get their banish effs, or get monsters out of the hand and into the gy. This variant isn't nearly as explosive as other Thunder Dragon decks, but it makes up for that by having power Metaphys boardwipes."

Be carefull with your summoning order. You can easily finish with a Borreload Savage Dragon + Crystron + another synchro monster + apo and/or Block Dragon.  If you summon apo tributing I:P, it will prevent destruction by cards effects. Summon I:P first and then Crystron. Your main goal going first is to get Block Dragon ASAP but without skipping Raptite (or making the summon impossible). Link summon using Block Dragon to trigger effect. Usually, i get Gigantes + Seeker + Researcher (gigantes will be easily Special summoned).  &nbsp;  Missus Radiant is just here for a T3 if your ressources are low. It can trigger Block Dragon, boost Earth Monsters and can get back a monster from GY. Never play it T1.  &nbsp;  Try to play this link order! I:P =&gt; Crystron =&gt; Apollousa (if you can).  &nbsp;  On opponent turn, you can disrupt monster effects and some spell cards (with Savage and/or Dragite). Don't forget to use Crystron effect ASAP, and decide which monster to synchro after (Sattelite, Crystal Wing  or Final Sigma (only in extra monster zone for this one if possible).  &nbsp;  Here are some videos going first or second, and some combos.  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Q9q7codG0</a>  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOgP9KAU-a4</a>  &nbsp;  Going first, you're very weak against Nibiru, really, or Kaijus.  Going second, it can be alright if you have multiples effects to play, if you just have one, there's a high chance that you'll be countered...  &nbsp;  Have Fun!"

This deck that utilizes Guardragon combo to super charge destruction sword combo and cause compl,"Okay so this is the final version of this deck tried, tested and true. So the strategy is advanced since the last posting and is more consistent.  Special summon (using dragon shrine or pendulum call to send it to the graveyard) Darkwurm to bring Gate zero to your hand. ( if you use darkwurm as a discard for pendulum call, it’s an easy plus 2; bringing harmonizing and white wing to your hand).  Normal summon summon a level 4 or lower dragon monster. Buster welp’s effect adds dragon of the destruction sword or memories to your hand. But if it dracoslayer that’s fine too. Link summon into Romulus, adding dragon ravine to your hand. Discard a card (mermories) and send tempest to your graveyard  use gate zero and any 8 scale apart from harmonizing magician for your pendulum scale. (harmonizing is to valuable when pendulum summoned but if it has to be done it has to be). Pendulum summon the harmonizing, darkwurm from your extra deck and dracoslayer if you have it, white wing magician if you have it and leave a zone open.  Upon pendulum summoning harmonizing special summon dragoncaller from you deck. And sychro summon Star eater. (Due to dragoncaller a effect if it attacks a dragon monster then it’s attack becomes 6400). Or special summon celestial to sychro summon beleeze.  link summon Elpy and pisty using darkwurm and other level 4 or lower dragon monster. Special summon another darkwurm from your deck. Sychro Summon Buster dragon in defense using white wing and darkwurm. (This turns all opponents monster to dragons). Then special summon another dragon from your grave yard using pisty.  link summon skull dread using pisty, Elpy, Romulus and dragon to break guardragon lock. Drawing 4 cards (if you haven’t got a buster blader in your hand already that’s the card you need.) If not add level 7 monster. Skull dreads effect to special summon buster blader and activate tempest effect banishing Elpy and pisty to special summon itself. Xyz summon odd-eyes absolute then link summon into protector welp of the destruction sword using absolute and skull dread. Which special summons odd-eyes vortex. Now if memories or dragon of the destruction sword are not in your graveyard use protector welp effect to send which ever one isn’t to the graveyard.  Now that buster blader, any dragon monster, dragon of the destruction sword and destruction sword memories are all in the graveyard, activate memories banishing buster blader and a dragon monster (not dragon of the destruction sword) and fusion summon dragon destroyer. ATTACK  if you did not attack with dragon destroyer upon ending your turn protector welp then does damage to your opponent equal to dragon destroyers attack (which if there’s dragons on the field or graveyard then that’s quite a lot).  If you did not end the duel upon your opponent next turn activate buster dragons effect equipping dragon destroyer with dragon of the destruction sword locking your opponent from special summoning from the extra deck.  dont forget that in situations where this combo gets negated or you get a brick hand (in aspects to this combo) Big Eye can come in real clutch just remember to bait any negate first. Flare metal can also come in handy if your in a position where burning their life points is needed. UPDATE: so I added mystic mine prevention, my main strategy against this is MIND CRUSH. It’s an old card and has gone under the radar as far a prevention of this scorn of a card. Just make sure you bait the negate first. Dust barrier is also an older card that can come in real handy in this situation if you have multiple normal monsters on the field they are unaffected for 2 turns which can end the duel. And if all else fails dark hole all your monsters they are pendulum after all and have mystic mine destroy itself.  but that’s it, get your game on and high five the sky"

The eventual goal is to play as many big dumb monsters as possible by using Raiden as your primary source of mill and easiest Minerva starter. From Minerva you can mill more. Doing so will usually get Shaddoll effects to make Construct and Apkallone to soft lock the opponent out of Special Summoned monsters and negate effects that could stop you.

Your main first plays will usually get trying to get out Morphtroninc Celfon and using either Where Arf Thou? (to pull out a Morphtronic Smartfon from your deck) or Machine Duplication to get two more Celfons.  If you don't have a Celfon in hand, you should be able to still add it with a Where Arf Thou? Or One For One.  Celfon is also a great target to use for linking into Linkuriboh and you can either get it back right away with Junk Box, Morphtroninc Repair Unit, World Legacy Succession, or Monster Reborn allowing you to use its special summon effect all over again to get out more. Morphtroninc Smartfon is a great card that can special summon itself by banishing a Morphtronic monster from your graveyard. While in attack position he can add any Morphtronic card (monster, spell, or trap) from the excavated cards to your hand. While in defense Smartfon can let you change the order of cards on top of your deck according to the die roll, or even just put them on the bottom of the deck.  Smartfon is also a tuner and being level 1 is fantastic because it allows you to synchro him with a Celfon for a Formula Synchron, or with a Staplen or Boomboxen for Naturia Beast, or just use him in any Link Summon. Morphtronic Lantron is another level 1 tuner but will mainly be used as a Where Arf Thou? To get Smartfon or One For One to get your Celfon. Morphtronic Scopen is a level 3 Tuner that can special summon a level 4 Morphtronic monster from your hand in which you will either Link Summon or Synchro Summon a Power Tool Dragon to search out a equip spell, Either D.D.R. Different Dimension Reincarnation, to Special Summon something banished from Smartfon or Morphtronic Repair Unit to Special Summon something from your graveyard, such as your Celfon, to use all over again. Scopen can also be used to synchro summon into an armory arm using a Celfon. Morphtronic Slingen allows you to tribute another Morphtronic monster you control to destroy one card your opponent controls. This can also fuel your graveyard with a target to banish for Smartfon or any of your revival Spell Cards. This deck is still a work in progress and I would very much appreciate any feedback. And as I don't have a Side Deck yet I would very much appreciate it."

Bandits have never been more dangerous!  Quiet life for a shut down of any combos, together with Lose 1 Turn they stun your opponent into oblivion.  Beatdown deck, so the best equip for me is moon mirror shield and power of the guardians makes your monsters invincible to destruction.  Extra net for the occasional extra deck summon your opponent might make.  Extra deck is mostly there for pot of extravagance, but may come in clutch.  Would like to hear suggestions and criticism!!"

This particular card and other cards that support are not as strong as the more popular and powerful archetype and is agreed throughout the world of Yu-Gi-Oh! the counterpart of the Blue Eyes White Dragon series.  Even though Red Eyes IS the key card in this deck, there are other monsters that can be a hassle. The true boss of the Red Eyes archetype, this is my opinion, is Dragun of Red Eyes. It is tremendously powerful monster and can be easily summoned with Red eyes Fusion and having Red Eyes and (sorry forgot to add it in when I was making the deck) the newly added Dark Magician plus a dragon effect monster, you would have an unfair advantage at the start. That is why I added not one but two more Red Eyes Fusion Cards to have an even higher chance of getting this menace of a monster. I also added Wee Witch just to give all the dark attributes on your side of the field a boost."

Even during it's ""old school"" days playing with Ryu Kokki, Pyramid Turtle, and Zombie Master, they have always intrigued me. There ability to spam the board with multiple monsters has always been an ability for them, but something has always been missing.  Be that as it may, I still do love playing with this incarnation of Zombies seeing the Shiranui archetype can be so active on the field, graveyard and banish zones. All in one turn! It's field disruption ability is quite good since Squire and Squiresaga came out, it does not negate. Which is all the rage when it comes to top-tier decks.  So the way I use this deck is as a tool-box deck, which means going second (which I tend to lean to when creating decks).  The side deck is incomplete at best, housing both tech-cards (Dragon's Mirror, Swordmaster) and actual side deck cards (Twin Twister) ."

The list has a lot of similarities to Shunping’s but I’ve also made changes to make it cheaper (I don’t own Seyfert) while maintaining a similar level of consistency and resilience. I also think this variant is easier to play personally. That said it is still a very challenging deck to play overall. The deck can pump out strong first turn boards but also has a fair bit of flexibility to play through challenging situations going second.  <em>Edit: note I have made a few additions to sections that I have included as italicized ""Edit:"" comments after the original section. I have not changed any original text or the deck itself.</em>  <strong>2 card choices</strong>  I’m not going to address every card in the deck but will address a few odd picks in the deck.  <u>Black Metal Dragon:</u> This card saw usage as a 1 of in Shunpings list. I’ve been using it as a 3 of because it makes a 1 card combo into a full board. It might not be as good of a 1 card combo as seyfert but at a fraction of the price I think it is well worth it.  <u>Keeper of the Shrine:</u> There are some specific combo purposes for this card such as with Black Metal Dragon but it is also in large part in the deck as a backup target for dragon shrine and foolish burial if you drew background dragon and Absorouter and/or have already sent them to the graveyard.  <u>Background Dragon:</u> This card is bricky if you draw it but makes dragon shrine and foolish burial into amazing starters. You can complete a whole combo without committing a normal summon assuming no disruption using this card.  <u>Autorokket Dragon:</u> So Cosmic Cyclone is a natural out to cards like Mystic Mine but doesn’t work against things like Secret Village of The Spellcasters or Imperial Order. This card gives the deck a natural out to spell and trap cards which block the deck from playing spells. Alternatively, you could substitute Knightmare Phoenix but the deck’s extra deck is very tight and also: Tracer, Elpy, Pisty, Rokket Synchron, and Quadborrel are all liabilities for locking the deck out of playing the Phoenix.  <u>Hibernation Dragon:</u> This card struggles to fit into the deck but at the same time has crazy effects in my opinion. It is a +1 for just summoning it while you have a level 4 or lower dragon in your GY. It can also summon Borreload/Borrelsword Dragon from the GY by banishing itself. Most of the combos don’t have room to summon search it though. I usually find this card makes a good backup Hieratic target if you don’t want to summon Brotaur because you already like your hand as is or Drew Brotaur. If you don’t like this card feel free to replace it with another Absorouter Dragon or whatever you want.  <strong>3 Combos</strong>  Here are some Youtube videos of different combos you’ll be looking for in this deck and how to perform them (Each video is about a minute long). Notably these combos are all done with minimum resources and can end on stronger boards with more resources invested. I also demonstrated some different boards you could choose to end on when using Romulus while Dark Locked.  <em>Edit: I've created a playlist with all the combos in it here: <a>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4wvY6W8_poYB0amunwwgUjIXYmFBELs-</a></em>  1 card combo with Black Metal Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPMmi7bVSt0</a>  2 card combo with any Rokket and Dragon Shrine  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U__fPt-FiVI</a>  2 card combo with any Rokket and Absorouter Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuGkXOpp7fY</a>  2 card combo with any Rokket and Quick Launch  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdo4q2Z9O5I</a>  Dubious Hand. Sometimes you get a hand that has no clear combo but can still make an awesome board.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCT_rcTkUJY</a>  <strong>4 Budget Options</strong>  While I’ve tried to keep this deck cheaper for my own wallet’s sake, some cards have gone up in price since I bought them. Below is a list of cards you can cut and potential substitutions for them:  1x <u>Striker dragon</u> -&gt; whatever you want. The third is a luxury for turn 3 if you use 2 turn 1 but most combos only use 1. <em>Edit: I've considered Barricadeborg Blocker before for the deck but there is no room to include it. may be a good substitute for a third striker dragon due to the decks tendency to shoot Boot Sector for Combos.</em>  3x <u>Dark Ruler No more</u> -&gt; Effect Veiler is a good budget handtrap  3x <u>Called by the Grave</u> -&gt; D.D. Crow. Doesn’t protect your combos but is a really strong affordable hand trap right now.  1x <u>Borreload Savage Dragon</u> -&gt; Draco Berserker of the Tenyi is much weaker but still provides a strong level 8 synchro disruption to end on.  1x <u>Borrelsword Dragon</u> -&gt; Draco Berserker of the Tenyi also is kind of a much weaker Borrelsword. If you aren’t looking at running two Draco Berserkers because really there is no reason to, you can throw whatever other dark boss monster you want in this slot. Borreload Excharge Dragon and Borrelguard Dragon are both really cheap alternatives that fit in easily. <em>Edit: Topologic cards also may make good replacements and are widely considered better than Borrelguard and Excharge Dragon. </em>  <em>Edit: Other budget options for the extra deck with their own pros and cons each include: an additional Borreload Dragon, Galaxy Satellite Dragon, Saryuja, Wee Witch's Apprentice, and Booster Dragon.</em>  <strong>5 Seyfert Upgrades</strong>  If you own Seyfert or have no qualms spending the money for him and the Black and White Dragons to go with him. You can cut: 1 Silverrokket, 1 Magnarokket, 2 Black Metal Dragons, and Hibernation Dragon to make room for that 5 card package. <em>Edit: Since the Black Metal dragons are being used as 1 card combos, removing a Cosmic Cyclone and a Dark Ruler No More over the Black Metal Dragons may be better a better choice.</em>  <strong>6 Side Deck</strong>  There are so many options for the side deck at the moment at so many different price points I felt that I didn’t want to hold the deck back or make it really expensive by trying to recommend a specific side deck. Feel free to use whatever tech cards you think are best for current meta."

The archetype normally has trouble going first; there is a distinct lack of defence and play prevention. This build aims to fix this problem, along with consistency issues and reliance on top-decking your field spells by incorporating a small Sacred Beast engine, featuring Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder!

They can go first or second - just make sure not to use Ride of the Valkyries if you go first.  &nbsp;  They aren't super reliant on the Extra Deck, meaning Pot of Extravagance is actually a great draw power card for them. They can afford to play 1 of everything (except the obvious 3-of) because losing any particular one still allows for their typical lines of play.  Being a Fairy-type based archetype means they potentially have the ability to lock special summons with Archlord Kristya.  Their new ""boss"" monster, Valkyrie Sigrun, has the ability to special summon any other Valkyrie monster from the hand or GY making it an excellent combo extender/starter, and is also, for some reason, a level 9 which means boards can end with True King of all Calamities.  &nbsp;  They also have 3 incredibly strong spells; Final Light, the aforementioned Ride of the Valkyries, and Mischief of the Time Goddess.  Final Light is essentially an archetype specific Soul Charge.  Ride of the Valkyries allows you to special summon as many Valkyries with different names as you want from your hand at the cost of bouncing your entire board back to the decks during the EP. Once it's in the GY you can activate its second effect to search a Mischief of the Time Goddess from your deck.  Finally, Mischief of the Time Goddess is a quick-play spell that you can activate at the end of your BP as long as you only control Valkyrie monsters. It skips the turn clock ahead to the start of your next BP allowing you to skip your previous MP2, EP, your opponent's entire turn, and your current DP, SP, and MP1 as though they never happened. This allows for some interesting things. 1, it means you can avoid the negative effects of cards such as Ride of the Valkyries and Celestial Transformation. 2, it also means you can essentially OTK your opponent regardless of the Valkyries low attack power weakness. 3, ""hard once per turn"" effects can potentially be activated again during the MP2 after your second BP.  &nbsp;  All in all, it is a rogue archetype that I truly feel hasn't been explored enough.  &nbsp;  I'm mostly uploading this to see how much the deck would cost. I have had success with it on EDOPro and am considering purchasing it irl now that Valkyrie Sigrun has been released in the TCG."

Go first and setup your negates so you can kill your opponent in the next turn.,"This is an Orcust deck with a scrap and a Danger! engine. The scrap cards will start the combo off and the Dangers to improve consistency. sometimes you need to take slight detours to start the combo off but with enough skill (and memory), you will always pull it off.  My rating:  Attack: 4/5  Defense: 4/5  Consistency: 5/5  Strong against: Shaddoll, Blue Eyes  Weak against: Gravekeeper, Nekroz  Main Scrap Combo:  Normal summon Scrap Recycler  Activate and send O-Lion/Jet Synchron to the grave (You need to send a card to the GY for Jet to revive it)  Summon a token with O-Lion's effect, or use Jet to SS itself  Link them into Wyvern  Activate Wyvern's effect, summon Recycler and send it back to the GY, then SS Golem from the deck, then destroy a card on the field. (Note: if you are going first you will need a card on the field to send to the GY, like a spell or a Danger)  Activate Golem's effect, SS Recycler  Activate Recycler, send World Wand to the GY  Link Golem and Recycler into Ib  Activate Ib and set World Legacy Succession  Activate Succession, summon Golem from the GY  Activate Golem again to summon Recycler, the send Knightmare to the GY  Link Ib and Wyvern into Apollousa (Don't use the other cards!)  Activate Knightmare from the GY, buff up any card (it really doesn't matter) and send Cymbal Skeleton to the GY  Activate Wand to SS Knightmare  Link one of the Scraps with Knightmare to make Galatea, then shuffle Wand from the banished zone into the deck, setting Orcustrated Babel  Activate Babel  Activate Cymbal Skeleton, SS Knightmare  Link the other Scrap with Knightmare to make Verte Anaconda  SS Dingirsu using Galatea, attach Cymbal Skeleton to it  Activate Anaconda, send Instant Fusion to the GY and SS Winda  End your turn. Winda will stay alive if you detach a material from Dingirsu (Preferably Cymbal Skeleton), so it will stay alive in your opponent's turn. Don't keep her for 2 turns because she will just lock you out of special summoning too!  &nbsp;  Overall, this deck is pretty high skill because you need to time your negates and create big combos. Have fun!"

You'll always want to see boss stage in your hand because it's one of the main win conditions in the deck. You'd also want to start with Aleister so you can use him as a onecard Mechaba. If you have Mechaba on the field and Monstrosity in your hand, you can activate Monstrosity to summon out two more level 9s and use those two for true king of all calamities to lock out your opponent in their turn. Then once it's you opponent's turn, use boss stage's effect to summon out preferably either hoarr or nidhogg to completely sut out your opponent. This could reach up to 3-4 negates in one turn. You can also use kaiju slumber either as bait for spells/traps or to wipe out the field and just make your plays from there. Lots of boss monsters and negates mean easy win."

Keep stunning your opponent by destroying your own spells and traps.,"This is a pure True Draco deck. Even with some of its cards on the banlist it still does pretty well in disruption and consistency. Since you won't need your special summons you can use duality and demise without worrying about much. Keep stunning you opponent's spells and traps by destroying your true draco traps or take out monsters with your true draco spells.  Attack: 4/5  Defense: 4/5  Consistency: 5/5  Strong against: Rokket, Shaddoll  Weak against: Altergeist, Kaiju  Since this isn't such a complicated deck I'm not putting any combos on here because you should figure it out quickly :P  In my opinion this deck is good for beginners to try on Yugioh simulators and to get to know the game. It's a bit expensive for the average person but if you are willing to spend the money, you are almost guaranteed to beat everyone in your locals. Have fun!"

The surrounding of necrovalley shuts down almost all of the current decks, such as Eldlich, Sky Striker Recursion, Orcust, Borrel, and Salamangreat, while also giving you protection to use handtraps freely. This variant also includes the ability to go super poly into starving and mudragon. This also has an interesting tech against Altergeist, where you can take their monsters for Quintet Magician, then wipe the rest of their board. But basically, the best thing to do search Spiritualist as quickly as possible then go into Supernaturalist with Necrovalley up. Also a good tech is Almarduk to use against Link Spammers.  My favorite thing is to set Spy with backrow floodgates and necrovalley, flip spy to summon recruiter, link into Witch's Apprentice, get the search from recruiter for whatever you need(Spiritualist or other Gravekeeper for fusion) Then go into Supernaturalist. Lowest it can be in this situation is 3700 ATK."

This build excels on breaking boards, and by going first it can easily set up a Winda lock via Cherubini and Instant Fusion, Verte Anaconda really helps this deck on mantaining a reasonable amount of threat and by bringing out my ace monster, Starving Venom.  Ultra Poly is Strong because it turns my basic combo into a Chimerafflesia+Verte Anaconda, however, it does not simply bring good as it can brick, fortunately you only need one copy of it on the deck, and because this deck ""branches"" a lot on its combos, you can live without searching it.  Now on the card review:  Kaijus: As a going second deck, we have to deal with some powerfull monsters, and Verte simply turns any of them into material for Starving Venom, Greedy Venom or even Triphyovertum.  Heliamphorhyncus: Searchable easy Greedy Venom material.  Pankratops: A good Versatile threat.  Drosophyllum Hydra: Searchable ""Kaiju"" under the right conditions, and can activate its effect to drain 500 Atk from an opponent's monster, i know, conditional, however useful.  Spinodionaea: Good card paired with Predapractice and a target for Scorpio's effect, can put counters.  Edge Imp Chain: Part of the Patchwork Engine, can search Patchwork itself by being sent as a cost by Scorpio.  Edge Imp Sabres: Part of the Patchwork Engine, can be revived via its own effect to easily put bricks back onto the deck and be used as a material for Verte or her Effect.  Ophrys Scorpio: Bread and Butter of the deck, main enabler, allows for many of the deck's branching combos, you always want it on your hand and alongside the edge imps.  Darlingtonia Cobra: Allows for an important search, such as Ultra Poly, Instant Fusion and Superpoly.  Lonefire: Unfortunately, we need consistency, this isn't a bad card by any means, but it isn't a good card either, being easily ""Hand Trapped"", Called, ""Impermed"" and such, it does best when you don't have any more options.  Chlamydosundew: Fusion Enabler, combos with Spinodionaea and Ophrys Scorpio.  Sarraceniant: Enables search and sometimes used in a pinch via its own effect by being used as a ""Hand Trap"".  Cordyceps: Ok, this is new, i don't like this one that much,enables the closing of some games via its powerful effect and can trigger Darlingtonia, useful on the grind and allows for a powerful follow-up.  Predaponics: Basic revival for more material or for a lost Sarraceniant for more search.  Predaprunning: Revives the big Fusions.  Frightfur Patchwork: The engine enabler itself, allows for Poly Searching, Half Chimerafflesia Searching and Scorpio Cost Search, while also maintaining card advantage.  Instant Fusion: Allows the Winda lock and for you to play safe when going second, useful card.  Mind Control: Grab some Apollousas :&gt;, Seriously now, it lets you grab something to make Verte.  Polymerization: Enables the best summoning method :).  Pot of Desires: Consistency.  Predapractice: Helps with combos, consistency and such, allows Spinodionaea and Sarraceniant to be more productive.  Ultra Poly: Card Advantage, allowing Verte to come onto the field more easily.  Predaprime Fusion: Allows for Otk and substitutes Verte in case of Predapractice before the link summon.  Super Polymerization: Board Break, Mind Break(not the actual card) and usually people forfeit easily after this card, allows for your Fusions to easily access the field, while looking at your crying opponent, combos with Verte.  Evenly Matched: See Superpoly until the Fusion part, allows Spell/Trap dealing.  Impermanence: Hand Trap and being a ""Must Negate"" on board breaking(sometimes).  EXTRA DECK  Greedy Venom: Evolution of my dragon, allows OTK and Threatens the opponent, but be careful as it can nuke everything including your own field.  Triphyovertum: Negates Summons, High Attack, can be Revived easily.  Starving Venom: My Ace, easily eats opponent's monsters by absorbing their ATK, can copy effects and nukes opponents's boards.  Dragostapelia: Puts Counters, Negates effects, can be revived easily.  Chimerafflesia: Can topple almost any monster, Banishes low level monsters, Search Superpoly or any fusion card for the next turn(your opponent will keep that in mind).  Earth Golem: Superpoly target.  Winda: Superpoly target and enables her Lock.  Mudragon: Superpoly target and can be used by instant fusion to protect your monsters against target.  Millenium-Eyes: Protects against almost any monster effect, can be used as a material for Dragostapelia, just like Mudragon, Winda and Earth Golem.  BLS Link: Easily allowed by Scorpio, sometimes wins games.  Cherubini: Winda Lock.  Verte Anaconda: Allows for Superpolying on your opponent's board, sometimes for a second time, makes your own kaijus not threatening anymore(as if they were in the first place) and makes Gameciel an enabler for Greedy Venom.  SIDE DECK: Still working on one as it is format dependant, probably some going first cards.  Q&amp;A  ""Why don't you run Lightning Storm?""  Too Pricy, can't have it for now.  ""Since when do you play around with this archetype?""  Since they were announced, played with them physically with only INOV cards, basically Starving Venom Turbo OTK.  ""How many builds of Predaplant do you have?""  I'm around 340 builds rn.  ""Why do you keep playing with this archetype as there are more competitive decks running around?""  Well, i'm a mostly competitive player and i like the archetype a lot, as i had a very lonely infancy so i played with plants, i have a Dionaea Muscipula, Stapelia Grandiflora and some others since those times.  ""Will you keep making builds for this deck and posting them on here?""  Well, i will probably post some builds here, as i don't have that much time in my hands for now, i will probably keep building more of them though as i want to top with them at least once.  END OF THE LESSON  This build isstill being worked on, so i might upload a slightly different one later as i am testing it against meta.  Hope you liked, like and share the build if possible.  With regards, Joeri.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

With Cynet Mining, it makes us play 9 starters. Add those ","With Scrypton added to TCG (idk about OCG tho), it makes Formud Skipper a must use in Marincess. Not only it acts as extender itself, Scrypton recycles the banished together with Marincess Great Bubble Reef. I will explain both Blue Tang and Formud route (both still needs extender tho).  Normal summon Blue Tang, dump Sea Horse (or Mandarin if you alrdy have Sea Horse), make Blue Slug add Sea Horse from GY, ss Sea Horse make Sea Angel add Battle Ocean. From here we need another extender to continue with applied Crystal Heart. Ss the extender, make Coral Anemone (if you wanna recur your Marincess in GY or if you wanna make a link 4) in extra zone, make Crystal Heart, place field spell (always place field spell when you're about to make your last big monster with Crystal Heart), ss any big link Marincess monster (Marbled Rock if first turn, battle protection, and can recur your resource too; Great Bubble Reef to recur banished or in GY Marincess; Wonder Heart to OTK if locked to water; Accescode via Splash Mage - Transcode route for optimal OTK).  The Formud route, normal summon Formud (or via one for one), use Formud choose any Marincess in extra deck, make Sea Angel, add field spell then Scrypton from Formud, ss Scrypton make Coral Anemone, use Coral ss Sea Angel. From here we need extender to continue. SS extender, make Blue Slug (you can choose not to use its effect so the big link will have more equip later), then make Crystal Heart so we have enough material for link 4 (Marbled Rock is preferred despite it's a link 3).  I only run 2 Pascalus because we run many other extender which are not its target, 1 Mandarin because its condition is kinda situational. The rest is just extender or staple with the trap lineup to turbo out Marincess Wave since Blue Tang cant search it consistently enough while still running another great target for Trap Trick.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/d0Kalvb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Super consistent, big immune body, great recursion, bunch of handtraps, and can even run Deep Sea Minstrel (to snipe oppnent's handtrap).  Cons: Standard board is just big immune tower with no interruption, sometimes water/cyberse locked  Cards to think of: Frog lineup (Marincess is a 2 cards combo, so adding another 2 cards combo engine conflicts with each other), Mermail Abyssteus-spike engine (it searches Sea Horse, but needs 2 water discards, at that point we could combo with those 2 cards instead of running this engine), Kaiju (Gameciel is a must for side deck), Abyss Dweller (great card, but needs consistent Pascalus to make it, and most deck can still play around Dweller easily)."

I really like this build, hopefully so do you. Please leave feedback and help the Crusadia community out :)!  Some comments overall:  ** General comments / Main Deck ** <ul>  	<li>I think Chaos Dragon Levianeer is just an insane card (you will see later on in my combos why). Multiple copies of it are live with any 2 starters/extenders in opening hand. You always have the option to use its Monster Reborn/pop 2 effect. If you dont like this card you might want to opt for multiples of Pot of Avarice, serving a similar purpose (that is, this deck can spam extra deck monsters like crazy).</li>  	<li>This is a going 1st deck. The main strategy is a 1.5 combo with Formud Skipper (leave a comment if you want a more detailed description) that ends on Bagooska + omni negate from Equimax + Crusadia Krawler. If you survive the 1st turn, then turn 2 you activate Crusadia Krawler, search World Legacy Succesion, combo off (including a search for Crusadia Leonis for piercing damage) and you should have at least 8k damage on board. This combo can also be achieved by Chaos Dragon Levinaar + lvl 4 Crusadia + any Crusadia monster.</li>  	<li>Crusadia really is a 15 card engine. This allows for the inclusion of a bunch of handtraps (no coincidence they are light and dark monster ofc, wink wink Chaos Dragon) and cards like Cosmic Cyclone. I have always been a fan of this card against pretty much any deck (e.g. Salamangreat, backrow, even decks like Cyber Dragon), but it is particularly good this format ofcourse.</li>  	<li>Parallel Exceed is why this deck works (hence the post ETCO). You run 3 + 2 + 2 copies (Formud Skipper/Cynet Mining) of this card. Any Crusadia monster + this card is full combo. Also note the Linguriboh in the extra deck for the easy link climb/backrow matchup.</li> </ul> ** Extra deck ** <ul>  	<li>Crusadia Magius is nuts. Really. Any 2 cards allows you to bring all of them on the field/in the GY, making room to abuse Chaos Dragon Levianeer or similar cards.</li>  	<li>Link Spider for when you get Nibirud! They Nibiru you, you link into Link Spider and you can extend with the Crusadia Monsters :).</li>  	<li>Crystron Needlefiber is new too! When you have Crusadia Arboria on the field + any link monster, you can do the ``standard'' link climb, but have an intermediate Needlefibre in between. This results in 2 Arboria in GY, which means better grind game. Seems pretty good to me!</li>  	<li>Topologic Trisbaena is NUTS! Its super easy to make in this deck, not OPT, and can be chain blocked with Crusadia Krawler. Is pretty much an instant win against any backrow heavy deck.</li> </ul> ** Side Deck ** <ul>  	<li>Kaiju package for going 2nd (I mean, it is Crusadia after all...).</li>  	<li>Heavy Storm Duster is nice for backrow/Mystic Mine matchup ofcourse.</li>  	<li>TCBOO because this deck can play it.</li> </ul> Leave suggestions and comments below! Crusadia players are STRONG!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

There is variants to set up defensive walls and prepare for another turn if you go first, you can make a nice wall. Madolche lesson is quite live in this build, but it becomes a bit of a win more card since your field is probably already OTK worthy, though I've had times where a well timed lesson bumps all my monsters when opponent thought they could clear some of them. Nobody ever expects lessons, cus nobody plays it, even though it works so well in this deck. I don't wanna go through more stuff, cus this is my favorite deck, and I won't be heart broken if it stays as a personal gem of mine."

I was disappointed in other ""pure lightsworn"" decks as...well they weren't really all that pure. The strategy with this is about the same as it always has been with lightsworn, win by turn 5 or lose. You can save yourself some grief if you wanna add beckoning light(s) to the deck, also people are afraid to have lightsworn at 40, but you don't really have to fear much. If JD gets negated/dies/etc. your other win condition is the actual lightsworn dragon which gets really beefy in this build. Shira does too for that matter. Just be careful not to charge of the brigade judgment traps, as they won't work then, same thing if you mill them with celestia's effect."

This is (no pun intended) a very special gem to me, as I don't think a lot of people realize just how strong this deck is with its own archtype. People keep adding cards outside the archtype, throwing in unnecessary traps or spells and it actually slows the deck down a lot. I used to shock people that I could even get out rainbow dragon as consistently as I did, and that was well before cards like crystal bond, conclave, ultimate magic (I had a high speed version that utilized advanced dark). Point is, there is a surprising amount of synergy in the cards alone, I can't say this can keep up with meta decks these days, but its still way faster than it used to be and really consistent. Getting out a turn two rainbow dragon is not hard, by turn 4+ you definitely have a few ways to win, whether its rainbow dragon, ultimate dragon, or abundance OTK. This is only going to get faster with Zenith coming out, although I'm hard pressed to figure out what to cut from this since the ratios are super perfect as is. (maybe one ruins, one bridge?)"

If you really wanted to, you can just side in the cards that make this how it currently plays, with jowgen and stuff, but honestly that version  just seems to lack the whole reason prophecy is interesting. adjust extra and side deck as you see fit."

Exceed allows you to easily make a rank 4, which can be vital vs Adamancipator and Eldlich, but it also gives you Accesscode Talker, a wonderful new link that you can climb into for a nigh unstoppable new OTK. Some new additions to the deck are Formud Skipper, and One for One to summon it. Formud Skipper acts as your way to search Exceed thus increasing its consistency. I'm running 3 copies of exceed since you want to see it every hand and im running desires so we dont want to risk banishing the other copy. Due to Adamancipator and Eldlich, hand traps are not very recommended due to their low impact. The 2 best ones to main deck are Ash Blossom since it can block all of the Eldlixers as well as both Gallant Granite &amp; Block Dragon. We also main deck Lancea to stop Eldlich's advantage engine and to deny Adamancipators the chance to summon block dragon."

Able to summon both Evil Hero Dark Gaia/Malicious Bane and Fossil Fusion with only Stratos + 1 earth lv4 monster, ","Happy Revenge of the Fifth day! Who would have thought that both Evil HERO and Fossil still have synergy in 2020 and is viable? Reminsicing the time we were playing in GX Tag Force or watching the anime, Supreme King was a tough guy to beat with his big Evil HERO Dark Gaia, while Jim Crocodile Cook was having his Fossil Fusion exclusive in the game and anime only, until now. Also so many new cards printed, making this build consistent and able to put big damage or break board in one turn going second. I will explain the combo and lineup here.  What we need is <strong>Elemental HERO Stratos + any earth lv4 monster</strong>, so we play E - Emergency Call, Solid Soldier (or Heroic Challenger Assault Halberd, pretty good if going second), and RotA to make it consistent. Combo is very simple, we search Addusted Gold via Stratos, use Addusted search Dark Calling, make Gallant Granite add Gigantes by detaching earth material, ss Gigantes make Verte (now we have 2 rocks in GY, Gallant and Gigantes). We can use Dark Calling to fusion for Dark Gaia or Malicious Bane if we have lv5+ in hand and we can use Verte to copy Fossil Fusion since we have rock in GY (some Fossil monster needs opponent's monster in GY as material).  HERO lineup: 3 Stratos, 2-3 Solid Soldier, 2 Addusted Gold, 1 Shadow Mist (Foolish Burial target, to search), 3 Emergency Call, 2 Dark Calling (can add Dark Fusion too if you want), and RotA. Assault Halberd has hero too in its name being Heroic Challenger (lol jk, its just free lv4 earth monster).  Fossil lineup: 2 Weathering Soldier (Foolish Burial target, searching Fossil Fusion), 2-3 Fossil Fusion (I only play 2 cus we have Verte and many other searchers), 2 Miracle Rupture (2 cus once per turn, dumps Weathering Soldier to GY), 1 Time Stream (Weathering Soldier target, super reliant on Fossil monster).  Other Support: 2 Nibiru 1 Kongrade (Running 3 Nibiru is an overkill and most combo deck can play around it; Kongrade is just another useful big atk and lv rock monster, despite being situational), 2 Radian Kaiju (useful big atk and lv fiend monster), Gigantes (combo piece while being a lv4 monster, can be replaced with Adamancipator Researcher), Nemeses Keystone (recycles banished card and itself while being rock monster, you can cut it since it will rarely used), Foolish Burial (self explanatory), Extra-Foolish Burial (to trigger the Fossil monster GY effect, utility card), Double or Nothing (OTK if has the opportunity), and the rest is just breaking board card or handtrap.  Extra Deck: 2 Skullgar (playing 2 cus its the easiest to summon while can be sent to GY for searching Fossil Fusion), 2 Malicious Bane (best Evil HERO).  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/2e0s5pW.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Nostalgic, consistency is ""<em>acceptable</em>"", able to break board or prevent opponent from building board, big monsters, and can even OTK. Fossil Fusion is free against Adamancipator.  Cons: 2 cards combo, super fragile, recursion is almost nothing, sometimes unable to put lethal damage (esp. when we use Malicious bane effect making us unable to atk except with HERO monster).  <strong>PS: the 1 card missing is Nemeses Keystone</strong>"

Make sure you summon The World, Frog the Jam, and Grandmaster of the Six Samurai under Saryuja's arrows so they get the attack boost. Tribute both Legendary Six Samurai Kizan on the end phase of your turn to skip your opponent's turn with The World's effect, then summon them back on your next turn. Make sure the two Kizans don't gain Saryuja's ATK boost. Attack with the two Kizans to do 3600, The World to do it 3400 (with Saryuja's boost), then attack with Frog the Jam to do the last 1000 (he also has Saryuja's boost).  NOTE: Use Saryuja's 2nd eff to summon The World and Frog the Jam. If you run out of Saryujas in your extra deck, use your current Saryuja to make a Cross-Sheep, use two Kizans to make an Emeral, then shuffle the 3 Saryujas back with Emeral's effect.

Can fal","<span>So basically the goal of this deck is to OTK, while opening up cards that can either OTK your opponent straight out or enough cards to stun your opponent while you set up. Jizukiru is a must because of the interaction to Kaiju your opponents biggest threat and contact fuse to get a free Sieger. Effect Veiler/Impermanence are the other cards you'll open up with to disrupt your opponent during their setup. I really don't know if this is meta-worthy or meta-killing but I have something good here that I want to share and get advice to make this deck even better. I'll go through each card choices, this list is by no-means end-all. I just took the best Cyber Dragon builds I saw on YouTube and took what I liked from all of them and made this.</span>  EDIT: By the end of this guide I modified the deck a little bit, I took out Stardust for Volcasaurus and  &nbsp;  <span>Main Deck x40</span>  <span>Monsters x23</span>  3x Jizukiru - A Kaiju. Main decking 3 because it' s a machine to go into Chimeratech with only 1 normal summon of any of your Snakes (I call the little Cyber Dragons this)  3x Cyber Dragon - Released in Cybernetic Overload, he is a welcome support card and is a must-run to run at 3. Fans have been asking about this for YEARS and we finally got it.  2x Galaxy Soldier - Honestly wanna run 3 but I don't want to see him that much, 3 feels like it limits what I can do with my other cards I draw into.  3x Cyber Dragon Vier - Super good to get you into your links and get more bodies on the board. Weird interactions with this card, beware. You normal any Snake that you wanna Machine Duplication, hold this in your hand. He will boost the ATK of your Cyber Dragons and lock you out of Machine Dupe. Go right ahead and use him after using Machine Dupe since you already resolved it. Doing so will net you an Infinity with the 2 Cyber Dragons straight outta the deck and a Verte Anaconda/Sieger to do whatever. He's super useful and good discard fodder as well. Can fuse with Jizu and be dumped with Rampage Dragon if you want to minimize drawing into him later.  3x Cyber Dragon Core - Little snake here techs you into Cyber Repair Plant (Which with your link 1's, you can send him to the graveyard and immediately use it now since you meet the requirements of the card, searching your Kaiju (seriously this thing being Light AND Machine is stupid synergy) Galaxy Soldier, or anything else you need that's Light and Machine). Nova lets you search Cyber Emergency, Revsystem, or if you have a board you can search Cybernetic Overflow which is one of the few traps that might actually be decent to even set on the field. I'll explain this later. He also searches Cyberload Fusion but you wanna keep that in the deck for Verte Anaconda.  3x Cyber Dragon Nachster - Can ditch another card from your hand to summon itself from the hand. If you ditch a Cyber Dragon you summon Nachster and revive Cyber Dragon. You just summoned two Cyber Dragon monsters for free. You can ditch Herz to trigger his effect, a useless hand trap, an extra kaiju, whatever. He's deceptively bad but his interactions let you set up the graveyard for the next card.  3x Cyber Dragon Herz - His 2nd effect (Hard Once Per Turn) where if it's sent to the graveyard you can add a ""Cyber Dragon"" (hard quotes, the named monster) from your GY or Deck to hand is really good. Beware, none of your Snakes are treated as ""Cyber Dragon"" in the deck, but the ones we run are treated as such in the graveyard. So if you dump him you can get back Nachster, Core, OG Cyber Dragon, or a Vier for whatever you need at the time. He can be dumped via Rampage Dragon. Specifically, Rampage Dragon lets you dump 2 Light Machines so you can send Herz and then a Snake you want to add to your hand that you can't search from your deck otherwise. Rampage, dump Herz and Vier/Core/Nachster and add that to your hand with Herz' effect.  3x Effect Veiler - Recently I threw out Ghost Ogre for this. So when I open up with Impermanence(s) and Veiler(s) I get multiple field negates from hand on my opponents turn. You basically run 6 field negates, and odds are in your favor for opening up with this or a Kaiju to start ruining your opponents board. It's also a tuner, but the only synchro I have in the extra deck is Stardust when I ran Ghost Ogre in the extra deck for the sided Ghost Ogre because Infinity + Stardust comes up a lot.  <span>Spells x12</span>  1x Overload Fusion - Running the 1-of I got the idea from a video, I can't remember but I give credit for whoever came up with the 1x Overload and Cyberload and 1x Verte Anaconda. You run the 1 so you don't draw it and can use it from the deck using Verte Anaconda.  2x Cyber Revsystem - Good combo piece when establishing a board. Searchable and Protects whatever you just summoned. Bring back a Sieger. If this card could bring back Infinity (I wish) easily a 3-of.  3x Cyber Emergency - This card is searchable by Nova due to it being a ""Cyber"" card. What this card does is search for a ""Cyber Dragon"" monster. Specifically, Cyber Dragon, Vier, Nova, Nachster, Herz.  3x Machine Duplication - Only works with Core/Nachster/Herz, but you can summon out 2 Cyber Dragons from your deck due to the name interaction. Beware of summoning out Vier before using this card. Vier, like I said before, boosts your monsters and disables you from using Machine dupe since your monsters need to be under 500 atk. Vier boosts by 500 atk/def and the lowest atk is Herz at 100, totaling at 600 atk. So, use machine dupe and spit out the 2 Cyber Dragons AND THEN summon Vier. This is important since you have 4 monsters on the field by having a snake, dupe, and vier. Which can go into Anaconda/Sieger/Infinity/whatever you wanna accomplish.  2x Cyper Repair Plant - Good amount because it's searchable. Both of it's effects are good, but it's first effect lets you search for Light Machine monsters. Which counts Jizukiru, and Galaxy Soldier.  1x Cyberload Fusion - Never really want to use this first unless you can make an Infinity through Rampage being level 5 for an XYZ. Your 2nd Fusion card for your 2nd copy of Rampage if the first one doesn't secure the OTK. Recycles your Field/Banished cyber dragons to fuse, and is a Quickplay. Usable from the deck by Verte Anaconda. No matter where this is, it's live. Except first turn, oh well.  &nbsp;  <span>Traps x5</span>  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence - It's Impermanence. Useful from hand if you have to go 2nd, disrupts your opponent who's setting up their board going first. Makes this deck win no matter what turn we go. This and Veiler give you 6 negates in the deck.</span>  2x Cybernetic Overflow - Extremely good removal effect and even lets you set up for Cyberload Fusion. If you brick you can at least search this card to have a Nova and this set to disrupt. AND, and, if it's popped you can search for a Cyber Spell/Trap. So you are f*****g your opponent when this is set regardless.  &nbsp;  <span>Extra Deck x 15 (ohohoho here we go)</span>  2x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon - They really released Chimeratech Fortress Dragon that can contact fuse with 1 or both Extra Monster Zones. Absorb your opponents Apollousa or whatever the hell they put and contact fuse with a little snake, granted you can still normal summon. If not you should lose, but regardless, this thing is really good.  1x Cyber Twin Dragon - Rarely sees play but is there when needed. Can attack twice and if it's boosted with Sieger, turns into a 4900 double swing for a total of 9800 damage.  2x Chimeratech Fortress Dragon - Honestly the whole reason I even started this deck was because the Jizukiru/Snake/ChimeraFort interaction. Every monster in your deck that's named Cyber Dragon on the field can absorb Jizukiru. As Seth from Street Fighter would say, ""Become a part of me!"" cause your opponents board is your 7th monster zone. This is also just a good card if you just wanna contact fuse in a huge Beater and boost it further with Sieger, or just BM and absorb it with Infinity. This deck is deeply synergistic with itself.  2x Chimeratech Rampage Dragon - You get 2 chances tops to OTK your opponent, so run 2. When it's summoned you can pop backrow up to the number of monsters used to fusion summon this guy. Overload/Cyberload can allow you to pop multiple BOARDS worth of backrow TBH, so this card is busted in the hypothetical situation where you're in a 2v1/3v1 or Free For All duel. Also allows itself to dump Light Machines from the deck to gain additional attacks for each monster sent to the GY (dumping a Herz and another snake you wanna search from your GY to your Hand, or just dumping Viers/Galaxy Soldiers/Kaijus just sitting in your deck). That's all it does, and all it needs to do. It's also a Dark Level 5. Go into Infinity if you couldn't finished them off for a board, or make Volcasaurus to pop their board and their lifepoints. Rank 5 cowboy.  1x Stardust Dragon - I honestly had this in when I was running Ghost Ogre, since Cyber Dragon and Rampage were level 5 and can make a Stardust with it. But you can run a Volcasaurus instead for 2 good reasons. 1, if you couldn't finish off your opponent or they had too many monsters, make this and burn them more MP2. 2, it's a rank 5 cowboy and live more often than making a Stardust, that's IF you side in ghost ogre. Do whatever you want. I changed this card as I was writing this deck build guide.  1x Cyber Dragon Infinity - Negates 1 effect per turn and can Honor Ark your opponents monster. This is it's deck that it will get it's most potential brought out, being it's the archetype it comes from. Now you can not feel like a jerk for using this card, cause you're running it's archetypal deck haha.  1x Cyber Dragon Nova - Has actual interaction with the deck because it was made for this deck. Nova wasn't invented to go into Infinity in meta decks, silly. (1) Can Special Summon a Cyber Dragon from your GY by detaching 1 card,(2) can also banish a ""Cyber Dragon"" card from your hand or field (your little snakes on the field) to boost NOVA another 2100 atk until the end of the turn. (3) if it's sent to the GY from the field by your opponents card effect, you can just bring out any machine fusion monster from your extra deck. I even forgot about this effect as I was writing this guide TBH, throw in a Barbaroid, The Ultimate Battle Machine for the LULZ.  1x Cyber Dragon Sieger - My friend Siegfried here is treated as a Cyber Dragon face-up or in GY, so it interacts with a lot of cards notably Revsystem to revive OTK potential. Busted. If it hasn't attacked in the BP yet, you wanna boost your Rampage another 2100 attack so it can swing 4200 x3 times. We don't play nice in this format. Nobody takes damage involving Sieger, which isn't good or bad but useful to know. This is bad if you wanna swing directly with Sieger, because neither player takes damage. If you attack a monster and you maybe boosted itself or another card, you don't take damage from Utopia the Lightning or Honest. So it works both ways. I think. Double check this.  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda - It's so busted it can make any monster on the field a Dark Monster. It can also use ""Fusion"" or ""Polymerization"" normal or quickplay cards from the deck at the cost of 2000 LP too. Jokes aside, you can't special summon for the rest of the turn after using this, so get whatever monsters you wanna get out before using this effect that turn. It's really good.  1x Linkuriboh - If you open up a hand where you only have Herz or another level 1 cybersnake, you can summon it and send it to link summon into this so you can get a cyber dragon in the grave for maybe Repair Plant, or to get Herz on the field into GY to get a search. It helps bricks. Which is really good.  1x Salamangreat Almiraj - Super good protection, easy to bring out. Beware you have your &lt;1000 atk monster be normal summoned.  1x Gravity Controller - Decent option, can't be destroyed by battle from main monster zone monsters, also bounces your opponents extra monster zone monster if it battles it.  &nbsp;  Side Deck x ??  15x Whatever - I don't know what to put in so whatever best gets you out of lockdowns should your opponent ever side for Cyber Dragons for some reason. IDK."

Jizukiru is a must because of the interaction to Kaiju your opponents biggest threat and contact fuse to get a free Sieger. Effect Veiler/Impermanence are the other cards you'll open up with to disrupt your opponent during their setup. I really don't know if this is meta-worthy or meta-killing but I have something good here that I want to share and get advice to make this deck even better. I'll go through each card choices, this list is by no-means end-all. I just took the best Cyber Dragon builds I saw on YouTube and took what I liked from all of them and made this.</span>  EDIT: By the end of this guide I modified the deck a little bit, I took out Stardust for Volcasaurus and Ghost Ogre's for Effect Veilers. <table>  <tr> <td>Monsters</td> <td>3x Jizukiru - A Kaiju. Main decking 3 because it' s a machine to go into Chimeratech with only 1 normal summon of any of your Snakes (I call the little Cyber Dragons this)  3x Cyber Dragon - Released in Cybernetic Overload, he is a welcome support card and is a must-run to run at 3. Fans have been asking about this for YEARS and we finally got it.  2x Galaxy Soldier - Honestly wanna run 3 but I don't want to see him that much, 3 feels like it limits what I can do with my other cards I draw into.  3x Cyber Dragon Vier - Super good to get you into your links and get more bodies on the board. Weird interactions with this card, beware. You normal any Snake that you wanna Machine Duplication, hold this in your hand. He will boost the ATK of your Cyber Dragons and lock you out of Machine Dupe. Go right ahead and use him after using Machine Dupe since you already resolved it. Doing so will net you an Infinity with the 2 Cyber Dragons straight outta the deck and a Verte Anaconda/Sieger to do whatever. He's super useful and good discard fodder as well. Can fuse with Jizu and be dumped with Rampage Dragon if you want to minimize drawing into him later.  3x Cyber Dragon Core - Little snake here techs you into Cyber Repair Plant (Which with your link 1's, you can send him to the graveyard and immediately use it now since you meet the requirements of the card, searching your Kaiju (seriously this thing being Light AND Machine is stupid synergy) Galaxy Soldier, or anything else you need that's Light and Machine). Nova lets you search Cyber Emergency, Revsystem, or if you have a board you can search Cybernetic Overflow which is one of the few traps that might actually be decent to even set on the field. I'll explain this later. He also searches Cyberload Fusion but you wanna keep that in the deck for Verte Anaconda.  3x Cyber Dragon Nachster - Can ditch another card from your hand to summon itself from the hand. If you ditch a Cyber Dragon you summon Nachster and revive Cyber Dragon. You just summoned two Cyber Dragon monsters for free. You can ditch Herz to trigger his effect, a useless hand trap, an extra kaiju, whatever. He's deceptively bad but his interactions let you set up the graveyard for the next card.  3x Cyber Dragon Herz - His 2nd effect (Hard Once Per Turn) where if it's sent to the graveyard you can add a ""Cyber Dragon"" (hard quotes, the named monster) from your GY or Deck to hand is really good. Beware, none of your Snakes are treated as ""Cyber Dragon"" in the deck, but the ones we run are treated as such in the graveyard. So if you dump him you can get back Nachster, Core, OG Cyber Dragon, or a Vier for whatever you need at the time. He can be dumped via Rampage Dragon. Specifically, Rampage Dragon lets you dump 2 Light Machines so you can send Herz and then a Snake you want to add to your hand that you can't search from your deck otherwise. Rampage, dump Herz and Vier/Core/Nachster and add that to your hand with Herz' effect.  3x Effect Veiler - Recently I threw out Ghost Ogre for this. So when I open up with Impermanence(s) and Veiler(s) I get multiple field negates from hand on my opponents turn. You basically run 6 field negates, and odds are in your favor for opening up with this or a Kaiju to start ruining your opponents board. It's also a tuner, but the only synchro I have in the extra deck is Stardust when I ran Ghost Ogre in the extra deck for the sided Ghost Ogre because Infinity + Stardust comes up a lot.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Spells</td> <td>1x Overload Fusion - Running the 1-of I got the idea from a video, I can't remember but I give credit for whoever came up with the 1x Overload and Cyberload and 1x Verte Anaconda. You run the 1 so you don't draw it and can use it from the deck using Verte Anaconda.  2x Cyber Revsystem - Good combo piece when establishing a board. Searchable and Protects whatever you just summoned. Bring back a Sieger. If this card could bring back Infinity (I wish) easily a 3-of.  3x Cyber Emergency - This card is searchable by Nova due to it being a ""Cyber"" card. What this card does is search for a ""Cyber Dragon"" monster. Specifically, Cyber Dragon, Vier, Nova, Nachster, Herz.  3x Machine Duplication - Only works with Core/Nachster/Herz, but you can summon out 2 Cyber Dragons from your deck due to the name interaction. Beware of summoning out Vier before using this card. Vier, like I said before, boosts your monsters and disables you from using Machine dupe since your monsters need to be under 500 atk. Vier boosts by 500 atk/def and the lowest atk is Herz at 100, totaling at 600 atk. So, use machine dupe and spit out the 2 Cyber Dragons AND THEN summon Vier. This is important since you have 4 monsters on the field by having a snake, dupe, and vier. Which can go into Anaconda/Sieger/Infinity/whatever you wanna accomplish.  2x Cyper Repair Plant - Good amount because it's searchable. Both of it's effects are good, but it's first effect lets you search for Light Machine monsters. Which counts Jizukiru, and Galaxy Soldier.  1x Cyberload Fusion - Never really want to use this first unless you can make an Infinity through Rampage being level 5 for an XYZ. Your 2nd Fusion card for your 2nd copy of Rampage if the first one doesn't secure the OTK. Recycles your Field/Banished cyber dragons to fuse, and is a Quickplay. Usable from the deck by Verte Anaconda. No matter where this is, it's live. Except first turn, oh well.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Traps</td> <td>3x Infinite Impermanence - It's Impermanence. Useful from hand if you have to go 2nd, disrupts your opponent who's setting up their board going first. Makes this deck win no matter what turn we go. This and Veiler give you 6 negates in the deck.  2x Cybernetic Overflow - Extremely good removal effect and even lets you set up for Cyberload Fusion. If you brick you can at least search this card to have a Nova and this set to disrupt. AND, and, if it's popped you can search for a Cyber Spell/Trap. So you are f*****g your opponent when this is set regardless.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Extra Deck</span></td> <td><span>2x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon - They really released Chimeratech Fortress Dragon that can contact fuse with 1 or both Extra Monster Zones. Absorb your opponents Apollousa or whatever the hell they put and contact fuse with a little snake, granted you can still normal summon. If not you should lose, but regardless, this thing is really good.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Twin Dragon - Rarely sees play but is there when needed. Can attack twice and if it's boosted with Sieger, turns into a 4900 double swing for a total of 9800 damage.</span>  <span>2x Chimeratech Fortress Dragon - Honestly the whole reason I even started this deck was because the Jizukiru/Snake/ChimeraFort interaction. Every monster in your deck that's named Cyber Dragon on the field can absorb Jizukiru. As Seth from Street Fighter would say, ""Become a part of me!"" cause your opponents board is your 7th monster zone. This is also just a good card if you just wanna contact fuse in a huge Beater and boost it further with Sieger, or just BM and absorb it with Infinity. This deck is deeply synergistic with itself.</span>  <span>2x Chimeratech Rampage Dragon - You get 2 chances tops to OTK your opponent, so run 2. When it's summoned you can pop backrow up to the number of monsters used to fusion summon this guy. Overload/Cyberload can allow you to pop multiple BOARDS worth of backrow TBH, so this card is busted in the hypothetical situation where you're in a 2v1/3v1 or Free For All duel. Also allows itself to dump Light Machines from the deck to gain additional attacks for each monster sent to the GY (dumping a Herz and another snake you wanna search from your GY to your Hand, or just dumping Viers/Galaxy Soldiers/Kaijus just sitting in your deck). That's all it does, and all it needs to do. It's also a Dark Level 5. Go into Infinity if you couldn't finished them off for a board, or make Volcasaurus to pop their board and their lifepoints. Rank 5 cowboy.</span>  <span>1x Stardust Dragon - I honestly had this in when I was running Ghost Ogre, since Cyber Dragon and Rampage were level 5 and can make a Stardust with it. But you can run a Volcasaurus instead for 2 good reasons. 1, if you couldn't finish off your opponent or they had too many monsters, make this and burn them more MP2. 2, it's a rank 5 cowboy and live more often than making a Stardust, that's IF you side in ghost ogre. Do whatever you want. I changed this card as I was writing this deck build guide.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Infinity - Negates 1 effect per turn and can Honor Ark your opponents monster. This is it's deck that it will get it's most potential brought out, being it's the archetype it comes from. Now you can not feel like a jerk for using this card, cause you're running it's archetypal deck haha.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova - Has actual interaction with the deck because it was made for this deck. Nova wasn't invented to go into Infinity in meta decks, silly. (1) Can Special Summon a Cyber Dragon from your GY by detaching 1 card,(2) can also banish a ""Cyber Dragon"" card from your hand or field (your little snakes on the field) to boost NOVA another 2100 atk until the end of the turn. (3) if it's sent to the GY from the field by your opponents card effect, you can just bring out any machine fusion monster from your extra deck. I even forgot about this effect as I was writing this guide TBH, throw in a Barbaroid, The Ultimate Battle Machine for the LULZ.</span>  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Sieger - My friend Siegfried here is treated as a Cyber Dragon face-up or in GY, so it interacts with a lot of cards notably Revsystem to revive OTK potential. Busted. If it hasn't attacked in the BP yet, you wanna boost your Rampage another 2100 attack so it can swing 4200 x3 times. We don't play nice in this format. Nobody takes damage involving Sieger, which isn't good or bad but useful to know. This is bad if you wanna swing directly with Sieger, because neither player takes damage. If you attack a monster and you maybe boosted itself or another card, you don't take damage from Utopia the Lightning or Honest. So it works both ways. I think. Double check this.</span>  <span>1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda - It's so busted it can make any monster on the field a Dark Monster. It can also use ""Fusion"" or ""Polymerization"" normal or quickplay cards from the deck at the cost of 2000 LP too. Jokes aside, you can't special summon for the rest of the turn after using this, so get whatever monsters you wanna get out before using this effect that turn. It's really good.</span>  <span>1x Linkuriboh - If you open up a hand where you only have Herz or another level 1 cybersnake, you can summon it and send it to link summon into this so you can get a cyber dragon in the grave for maybe Repair Plant, or to get Herz on the field into GY to get a search. It helps bricks. Which is really good.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Almiraj - Super good protection, easy to bring out. Beware you have your &lt;1000 atk monster be normal summoned.</span>  <span>1x Gravity Controller - Decent option, can't be destroyed by battle from main monster zone monsters, also bounces your opponents extra monster zone monster if it battles it.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Side Deck</span></td> <td><span> </span></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;"

This is my fourth deck that has been downloaded so far on this website.  Like the name suggests, this deck comprises of cards from one of the most recent Yu-Gi-Oh! Series (Not talking about VRAINS): Arc V's D/D and D/D/D archetype!  This archetype is full of powerful fiend type pendulum monsters with their respected monsters waiting within the extra deck and was used, and not to mention mastered, by none other than Leo Corporations Leo Akaba. (I honestly have a D/D deck myself but I do not have the full series)  Now... Here are a couple of boss monsters that I decided as this decks respective boss monsters:  D/D/D Doom King Armageddon:  This bad boy here is one that is to believe the most powerful pendulum card of its series (excluding the extra deck monsters.)  It has a grand total of 3000 attack points but a low point total of 1000 defense points.  However, the loss in defense points can be greatly protected by its special ability (Which is why I put three.)  When it or other monsters are destroyed (either by battle or card effect), you can choose one of the destroyed monsters and add its attack points to the rest of your monsters. This is specifically why I put three of these guys in.  Extra deck boss monsters:  It was a four-way-tie between D/D/D Super Doom King Bright Armageddon, D/D/D Super Doom King Purple Armageddon, D/D/D Super Doom King Dark Armageddon, and D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc.  For the Super Doom King's, each one of them tends to protect each other (like Declan said during his last duel with Yuya) and especially against non-pendulum and pendulum type monsters. The only reason why I added d'Arc in was for its special ability in which it can convert damage you would have taken into life points from the Dark Contracts."

Easy Emperor Wisel equipped with Dragon Buster or Winda, super consistent, great recursion, and ","Being quarantined makes Konami print good cards (loljk). Theres not much to explain in this combo as it's only a short one, and we have to work based on what's in our hand. Most of the times, we're trying to resolve Nucleus + Meklord Assembly for Emperor Wisel while having extender for Union Carrier (example, Obligato + Fortissimo field) or Winda via Dragma engine. The Dragma engine synergizes well with this deck, it contains Magicians Souls fodder while we can still recur it with Nadir from GY, great recursion and removal thanks to Shaddoll Ruq, Bastard, and N'tss. But while its combo is easy, <strong>we need to to pay attention to card interaction and restriction</strong>, making this deck prone to misplay and needs practice.  Pros: Easy setup with spell negation, summon prevention, big monster, and possible protection. Great recursion thanks to Ruq and the new Meklord trap. Good going  second with removal and/or big damage.  Cons: prone to misplay, main deck is super tight without handtrap/breaking board card (can be adjusted tho)."

Meluseek and kunquery provide situation disruption, while marionetter provides set up. This deck is trap heavy with disruption to monster effects, battle phase, and provides destruction or bouncing cards. It also runs super-poly just to be more annoying."

Dark World 2020 deck build  ,"I use TCG rules and current up to date Yu-Gi-Oh rules when making my decks in order for them to be up to date with other decks. This deck has many combos for multiple situations with tons of power and is extremely fast, it has a very powerful extra deck selection with readily available cards to summon them. I've updated my original deck due to learning more rulings and I feel it actually made it way better. I have been reading what everyone has been saying and suggesting and I've also been looking up alot of stuff and I'm constantly updating this deck. I've added a couple Galaxy-eyes for strong hitting and feild popping also Draglubion so I can bring out c107 or Harbinger super easy, i use sky prison and D/D/D all the time with Harbinger to lock people up. I've added some links since I've been seeing alot of OP links when dueling online and now I feel I have a good verity of stuff to easily counter alot of opponents in the new 2020 meta. I usually pick 2nd because that's what this deck is best going and most people actually pick first anyways to setup their board and this deck is great of popping boards. Feel free to leave a like &#x1f44d; and comment any suggestions or advice you might have, I love to see and read feedback from people thanks guys &#x1f601;"

Below are the reasons i run certain cards, The norm cards, i dont need to explain them like Rod, Dark Magic Circle and Eternal Soul.  Apprentice Illusion Magician is not as useful as it once was, however it still has its uses being a search for Dark Magician aswell as being a Honest for Dark Spellcasters. I also Run Kaijus because i prefer to be able to break down a players end board rather then stop single combos. If I wanted to run a second copy, id probably Drop Apprentice Illusion Magician.  Dark Magic Veil is a personal favorite of mine. it can extend your boar by summoning a Dark Spellcaster from either the GY or your hand!? All for the cost of 1000LP. For a more useful Monster reborn to either start, extend or recover your board, cant argue with that.  The Spellbook draw engine is used over other cards like Allure Of Darkness because i dont like the banishing requirements for allure. Aswell as Foolish Burial Goods, Upstart Goblin and Metalfoes Fusion for more deck thinning as well as draw power.  Along with Dark Magician Girl being included to utilize The Dark Magicians floating effect, Bond Between Teacher And Student is played for a added bit of spice and fun. However if you didnt wish to run them, you can always swap out for a 3rd copy of Super-Polymerization or other control cards.  Skill Drain in a Dark Magician Deck is a MUST! it has single handed won me a lot of games, so i cant recommend it enough.  Magicians Combination is one of those mar-mite cards, some like it, while others dont. I personally like it as it gives Dark Magicians a negate it needed. use it along side with Eternal Soul and even to protect Soul.  Beat Cop is another card used to protect your decks best and worst card. By tributing itself, (so even Skill Drain doesnt effect it) place a counter on Eternal Soul, now when ever it would be destroyed, you can remove the counter instead.  Hope you like the deck profile!"

This deck is doesn't OTK often but has a far better board after a few turns with 1 to 2 behemoths set and and 3 to ,"This deck is quite easy to use, here is what you do with each main card  Hidden city/Terraforming : (Search Hidden City), Activate Hidden City, Add Guru with effect (if already have Guru in hand add Fiendess (if already have Fiendess in hand add a Behemoth)), next Set Guru, Use Hidden City effect to flip guru to DEF, with guru add Fiendess (if already have Fiendess in hand either 1. Add another Fiendess 2. Add Final Battle (Better earlier game) 3. Add Cave Clash (Better later game)) If added spell or trap, activate or set it.  Fiendess : Fiendess can be discarded to negate an effect or activation (NOT a summon) of a card (Spell, Trap or Monster) while you have a face-up subterror during either players turn. It can also be Summoned to use its second effect to set 1 monster you control to Special Summon 1 Subterror from your GY or hand in either DEF position.  Guru : Guru's FLIP effect is to Search a Subterror CARD (Monster, Spell, or Trap) from your deck. He also has an effect to set another monster (on either field) and himself, this becomes a quick effect if you control another ""Subterror"" card (it must be a face-up card though but activating a Subterror trap then chaining Guru's effect does work).  Behemoths : When you use Guru's, Fiendess's 2nd effect, Final Battle, Hidden City, or another Behemoths effect to set a card you can Special Summon them from your hand (During either players turn) But you can't Summon them when Fiendess 1st effect sets a monster because it is a cost.  The Extra Deck : You don't have to use this combination of cards, you should just use your extra deck for banishing by the effect of Pot Of Extravagance, but it like this for that it can still be useful.  Handtraps and Solemn cards : These are pretty basic to use but here is a list of what is in here and what else you could use  Ash Blossom : If a card is moved from the deck to the GY, hand or Summoned to the field, you can discard this card to negate the activation, it can also negate effects that draw.  Ghost Belle : If card card is moved from the GY to the hand, deck, banished zone or Summoned to the field, you can discard this card to negate the activation.  Droll and Lock bird : If your opponent adds cards from their deck to their hand (drawing counts) EXCEPT during the Draw Phase you can discard this card to stop them from doing this for the rest of the turn (It does NOT stop them from adding the card you activate) Remember that this Also blocks YOU from doing the same for the rest of the turn.  Sauravis : If an effect TARGETS a monster a monster you control you can discard this card negate the activation, it also has the effect that while its in the GY, when your opponents Special Summon a monster(s) you can return this card to your hand to negate the summon and banished the would be Summoned monsters.  True King Lithosagym, the Disaster : This card can be summoned by by destroying 2 monster on your field and in your hand including a EARTH monster and if they were both EARTH monster you can banish 3 monsters from your opponents Extra Deck (you choose which monsters are banished), this can heavily disrupt your opponents plays."

Today, we will be taking a look at a deck that isn't as great, but has potential, what I mean, is Machina.  &nbsp;  The Machina archetype are a group of machines that love discarding themselves to summon big beaters onto the field, here is a deck list that does provide less budget options  &nbsp;  Budget Breaking options:  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li>Put Pot of Desires for Iron Draw, since Iron Draw isn't as consistent at all, having a requirement that isn't hard to achieve, but, come on, Pot is a LOT better than Iron Draw</li>  	<li>Scrap engine. Since we run Scrap Recycler, 1/3 of the Scrap engine, why not splash in the rest of the bunch? I didn't include Scrap Golem because it is over 5$ per copy, being at either $11-$18 right now. Scrap Wyvern would be good extra deck for this deck and is just here for the Scrap engine.</li>  	<li>Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion is a great extender and over all a great card you could include with this deck, since if you send it to the graveyard, it will give you a token, which is somewhat decent since Scapgoat got limited by just giving your four of those tokens.</li>  	<li>Jet Synchron is a decent budget card, not on the list for those cheap buy 3 and leave players in YU-GI-OH! Jet Synchron has the effect to special summon from the graveyard by sending one card in your hand to the graveyard, but its banished at the time it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber and any other kaiju (mainly Dogoran and Gameiciel perferably) would slip into this deck without a problem, maybe being your side deck since we have no side deck, go crazy with it!</li>  	<li>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring with Twin Twisters and any other staple would make this deck have a decent competitive edge, since Ash is probably the best handtrap of the game's history and Twin Twisters for the backrow removal</li> </ol> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well I hoped you enjoyed this decklist, thanks for looking at it, and I will see you card players next time!"

Given the plush doll and horror themes of Fluffals, it's very obvious why I chose to name this deck after a movie from the <em>Chucky </em>franchise.  This deck actually functions like a normal Fluffal deck would--your strategy is to blindly go second and try to OTK your opponent. And because of Edge Imp Scythe and Frightfur Whale, Fluffals improve in both regards!  In my personal experience, I have never needed to use more than 1 Fluffal Dolphin. I'm not sure about other Fluffal players. But I also used 3 Fluffal Penguin because it's one of the best monsters to fuse with Edge Imp Scythe."

This deck is built primarily for going second, however as this can't always be guaranteed, some cards have been side decked which would maximise the deck's potential. </span>  &lt;!--more--&gt;  <strong>Monsters:</strong>  Cyber Dragons:  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a> - Run at three for the benefit of <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a>, which remains the deck's win condition. Seeing this in the opening hand when going second isn't an issue given it's effect, however it can brick if going first and you have no other cards to assist in bringing it out.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a> - The deck's main starter and MVP, ran at three. When summoned, this will, if uninterrupted by your opponent, will add 1 ""Cyber"" spell/trap to your hand. This card's secondary effect (activated in the Graveyard) can also help reconstruct your board if your opponent has cleared your side of the field monsters, by bringing a Cyber Dragon monster from your deck to your hand at the cost of banishing Core from the Graveyard. Target #1 for Machine Duplication.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> - Again, ran at three as this is a Machine Duplication target. Both effects are useful, although you are far more likely to get mileage out of Herz mid-game when special summoned for Rank 5 XYZ plays. This card also synergises well with <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a>, given Galaxy Soldier's special summoning condition of discarding a light monster, this card brings a ""Cyber Dragon"" to the hand to facilitate the special summon of the second Galaxy solider - instant XYZ summon into <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nachster"">Cyber Dragon Nachster</a> - Ran at two, as this is the only Machine Duplication target that can brick on turn 1; without another monster (preferably a Cyber Dragon) or Machine Duplication in hand, this is as good as useless. This card really shines when your Graveyard is filled with Machine monsters with the magical 2100 ATK or DEF value, however be wary that once activated you can no longer special summon non-Machine monsters for the remainder of the turn.  <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Vier"">Cyber Dragon Vier</a> - Suprisingly useful link-fodder and a helpful chain-blocker for Cyber Dragon Core. I've heard of people running this at more than one for these reasons, however if this was the sole monster in my hand on Turn 1, I'd be very disappointed. Given that this is also <em>not</em> a Machine Duplication target, I would not advise having more than two in the deck.  Other monsters:  <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> - A Cyber Dragon in all but name. This is the go-to card to make <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a> as it leaves your ordinary Cyber Dragons available for other uses. Synergises with <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Herz"">Cyber Dragon Herz</a> very well and is searchable through Cyber Repair Plant. In addition, if you have already summoned <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> and these remain floating in your deck (a brick waiting to be drawn), these are ideal cards to discard to grant Rampage the additional attacks. Ran at two, as three increases the likelihood that multiples could be drawn and bricking on turn 1.  <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a> - Ideal for removing a troublesome opposing monster (think Apollousa) and is easily removable thanks to <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>. Searchable through <a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a>. Ran at one, however this is a very good candidate to increase to two.  <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> - Easily accessible beatstick in the mid-late game, 3000 ATK is not to be sniffed at. The banishing summoning condition synergises with the deck very well and comes with a built in Monster Reborn-effect for additional link-fodder. As it is 8 stars, this also can be used as material for the XYZ summon of <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a>. This card can brick and therefore is ran at one. If you are not running Dingirsu, I would suggest replacing this with another copy of <a data-name=""Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju"">Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju</a>.  Handtraps:  These are primarily a reflection of the current meta and can be adjusted accordingly without affecting the engine. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> - Ran at two, due to the 'once per turn' condition.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""D.D. Crow"">D.D. Crow</a> - Can be increased to three, if you can find the space</li> </ul> <strong>Spells:</strong>  <a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a> - The ROTA of the deck, with built in protection at the cost of a discard. Ran at three.  <a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a> - An extender that relies on you having at least one ""Cyber Dragon"" in the GY. Searches the majority of the monsters in the Main Deck (excepting Levianeer and the Hand Traps), however is a hard once per turn and given the prerequisite, I wouldn't advise increasing to three copies.  <a data-name=""Cyber Revsystem"">Cyber Revsystem</a> - Another useful extender; Monster Reborn for ""Cyber Dragon"" with the bonus option of allowing you to special summon a Cyber Dragon from the hand. Not particularly useful for your Extra Deck Monsters (barring <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>), however you have Nachster to bring them back from the GY. Could increase to two, however I prefer having a copy of Monster Reborn.  <a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a> - Your win condition. Target one ""Cyber Dragon"" with less than 500 ATK, special summons two Cyber Dragons from the deck. If this resolves, it's usually game over. Having this at three does make the deck very bricky, however given the risk/reward involved, the benefit outweighs the cost.  <a data-name=""Overload Fusion"">Overload Fusion</a> - Facilitates your OTK. Ran at two because although you want to see this card, having multiples in hand at the cost of an extender is not fun. The only target is <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a>, however it's the only one you really need.  <a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a> - Quick play fusion card that also can facilitate an OTK, for the purpose of bringing out Cyber Twin Dragon or Rampage. In terms of using it, this is best activated during the battle phase, after all other monsters have attacked, bring out <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> for 5600 points of damage.  <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> - Staple for seeding the GY and activating Repair Plant.  <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> - Useful as an extender and to bring back boss monsters in a pinch.  <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> - Consistency boost. A small boost, but one worth having.  <strong>Traps:</strong>  <a data-name=""Cybernetic Overflow"">Cybernetic Overflow</a> - Great card. Maximum 4 cards popped on your opponent's side of the field and if destroyed by card-effect, you can search another ""Cyber"" Spell/Trap from your deck. Sided an additional copy for going first. Banishes Cyber Dragons to set up for Cyberload Fusion.  <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> - Wins you games!  <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> - A particularly nasty way of clearing the opponent's board. It might stop you from OTKing on Turn 2, but it's definitely worth running at three!  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> - Useful to dispose of your Kaiju, and wiping the field clean in mirror matches or the occasional Orcust deck.  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a> - Snatches opponent's monsters out of the Extra Monster Zone, what's not to love?  <a data-name=""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"">Chimeratech Rampage Dragon</a> - Insanely powerful card. Has the potential to act as a Harpie's Feather Duster (depending on the number of monsters used for its Fusion Summon) and can attack three times. Ran at two as I'm running two Overload Fusions.  <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> - No matter how tempted you may be to cut this card from the Extra Deck, don't.

If you don't need another level 10 monster, and you've got Cyber Dragon on the field, use Flying Pegasus's effect, to make it a level 5, to go into Cyber Dragon Nova, then Infinity. I forgot to put in Machine Duplication, you can usually bring out Night Express Knight, so if you want to put in Machine Duplication, it wouldn't be a bad idea as a 2 of.  There wasn't really any space in the deck for Exodius, but it's also an option. If you're facing Eldlich, side in Neos Fusion and Rainbow Neos, though it does have some synergy with the whole Rank 10 thing.. Revolving Switchyard will often times decide if you lose or win, as it can de-brick your hand. Malefic Cyber End is a nice card, as you'll likely have a field spell on the field. It's also a Machine Level 10, which makes it pretty useful. JUST REMEMBER TO ONLY BRING IT OUT WITH A FIELD SPELL ON THE FIELD, even if your opponent has one, just don't make the same mistake I once did.  That's basically it. Good Luck, and make Anna proud."

I searched all web trying to find a good one for this deck, i didn't, so i made my own. I think that's the most consistent ""meta"" you can get.  <strong>Offerings to the Gods:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Almost any hand will open with one Nordic monster, you will almost always use him as material for Gullveig.</li>  	<li>Alviss is the best target for Gullveig effect, so if you have one in hand, don't use him as material for the link but as offering for the effect.</li>  	<li>Rescue Cat can summon 2 Nordic Beasts from your deck, if you don't have any in your opening hand. Summoner Monk is another alternative aswell.</li>  	<li>But what if i don't have it? Well you can easily abuse the tokens from Hippo Carnival. Simply chain Hippo Carnival to Gullveig effect and offer the tokens.</li>  	<li>Make sure to dump the right Tuners in your GY! If summoning Odin, you want at least one Nordic Ascendant Tuner so go for Vanadis, if summoning Thor you want a Nordic Beast Tuner, so go for Guldfaxe.</li> </ul> <strong>Immortal Deities:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Gullveig offers protection from target effects to any Aesir god, if pointing to one, she can't be targeted for attacks aswell as long as it points to that god.</li>  	<li>Mound of the Bound Creator will offer some extra protection if needed.</li>  	<li>If any god goes to the GY while you have Alviss there, you can banish him to Summon another one directly from your Extra Deck.</li>  	<li>And finally if <strong>destroyed</strong> by any opponent card and sent to the GY, each Aesir can come back during the EP by banishing the right Nordic Tuner.</li> </ul> <strong>Valhalla, Hall of the Gods:</strong> <ul>  	<li>The Extra Deck is very flexible, the only cards you really need are the Aesir Gods and Gullveig really.</li> </ul> Any suggestions just write down in the comments.

First and for most you want to get to Red Rising Dragon with a resonator tuner ASAP. from there you can go into the ""Big Dragons"" of the deck like: Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, Hot Red Dragon Abyss, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane, Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend, Red Nova Dragon, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity, and of course Red Supernova Dragon.  A little spice I found through testing the deck is ""Supay Duskwalker"", Not only can it set up your graveyard with a resonator tuner but it can grant you access to a level 6 synchro or a big body for more of a higher level Synchro monster.  honestly I could go on and on how somethings go in the deck but I have a feeling its a lot more fun trying it for yourself.  &nbsp;"

Use the floodgates to counter things that you can't stop with the main deck Altergeists. Occasionally you will come across the matchup where you need your extra deck. In that case, sub out extravagance for demise and the 3rd duality so you won't risk losing key cards to negate things the main deck can't. Be careful with when you activate Imperial order because you might drain too many life points to use the solemn cards. Sub in Waking the Dragon to get Raidraptor on the field to deal with heavy backrow removal decks. Also, if you have a choice, always go first because traps are slow and you should quickly setup your board before your opponent can react.  My rating:  Attack: 3/5  Defense: 5/5  Consistency: 4/5  Strong against: HERO, Mystic Mine Burn/Exodia  Weak against: Harpies, Adamancipator  Negate combos:  Normal summon Meluseek  Link it into 1 of  the link 1s (Linkuriboh, Almiraj, Anima) Linkuriboh will negate an attack so is preferable, however if you need to get rid of a troublesome monster you can use Anima.  Activate Meluseek's GY effect, add Multifaker to the hand  If you activate a trap during your opponent's turn you can do this:  SS Multifaker with its effect (you can summon it even if you used a counter trap, see <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Tips:Altergeist_Multifaker"">here</a>)  Activate Multifaker, summon Silquitous from the deck. if you would use Silquitous's effect bounce Multifaker  Now you have an attack negate (if you used linkuriboh), a card bounce and a Meluseek in the GY, which you can then use Manifestation or Marionetter to SS it.  &nbsp;  Set Spoofing facedown  Normal summon Marionetter  Activate its effect, set Manifestation  End your turn. The real part of the combo starts during your opponent's turn.  Activate Spoofing and shuffle Marionetter to get Multifaker to the hand.  Activate Multifaker's effect, summoning itself from the hand.  Activate Multifaker's second effect, summoning Silquitous from the deck.  Basically most end boards are going to be Multifaker and Silquitous in the monster zones and a manifestation/protocol to be activated.  &nbsp;  This deck is fun to play but very annoying to play against because of its disruptive ability to constantly negate your opponent's plays. I have played many online games with this deck and most of my opponents rage quit :P  Anyways stay safe and have fun!  &nbsp;"

It doesn't matter if you didn't equip a link monster for your Borreload Savage because you might not even need it.

Then, you proceed with your combo by Synchro Summoning using Riser, a level 1 tuner and Borreload Savage to make the mistake known as <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity</a>, which essentially locks your opponent out of playing Yu-Gi-Oh.  <strong>Plan B, if something goes wrong</strong>  Your goal should be putting up at least 3 negates on the field including a <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, a <a data-name=""D&lt;a data-name=&quot;/D/D Cursed King Siegfried&quot;&gt;/D/D Cursed King Siegfried&lt;/a&gt;"">D</a><a data-name=""/D/D Cursed King Siegfried"">/D/D Cursed King Siegfried</a> and an <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>.  <strong>Plan C, if your dreams get crushed</strong>  <a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a>, <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, set random backrow and pray.  <strong>Yeah that's cool and all but how do I even get to that?</strong>  Basically 1 card. <a data-name=""D/D Swirl Slime"">D/D Swirl Slime</a>, the absolute star  of the show.

I don't think there's much more to it. One of the most powerful meta decks combined with a 1-card Utopic Zexal and the abilit,"Out of all the previous adaptations of Yu-Gi-Oh!, Zexal is regarded as having one of the strongest monsters ever to be in the game. Not only in the anime - but even monsters of that period themselves, for example: Zoodiac. However, nothing compares to sheer base strength of Don Thousand's ace monster, Number C1000: Pneumonia....sorry, Numeronia. Nobody would ever <em>dream</em> that Konami would release a monster with base stat of 10,000! And well, they haven't. Yet. But as of now we just got a few other gate thingys from the anime (and boy are they strong). The four Numeron gate cards all allow you to summon Number S0: Utopic Zexal: and with them all being summonable off of just one field spell - Xyz Summoning, has never been better. I present to you: Numeron Eldlich.  One of the best things about the Eldlich archetype as a whole is their ability to build up a board using a scarce amount of resources. With the Spells and Traps being able to switch between themselves, and Golden Lord using his effect to pitch them: you can still set up a competent board using the brickiest of hands, and have to enough to make a follow-up play the next turn. That's what makes this deck even better. This list allows you to end on your standard Eldlich board no problem. But what makes the new support cards worth it is the fact that - for almost 0 cost - you can lock your opponent out of activating effects for the rest of their turn. Having just the Utopic Zexal itself will give your opponent a hard time, but following that up with a pop from Conquistador and a Ash or Imperm will guarantee you victory. So now that the main strategy is out the way: here are some reasons behind why we play the cards we do.  The focus of the deck is turboing out your four gate monsters as fast as possible. In order to do that - we have to run three copies of Numeron Network. You always want to see the card, so I'd recommend playing Terraforming and Set Rotation too for the added consistency. Another great card that allows you to really unclog your hand is Memories of Hope. Since all the gate cards are number monsters, Numeron Network followed up by Memories is a free draw four. That's incredibly good! The only possible downside is the card tends to brick in certain situations when you don't open one of the five copies of Numeron Network - but even then you can just use it as fodder for Golden Lord. The deck has that much consistency. The final thing I'd like to mention are the more situational cards you play. Since you don't run Extravagance - there are a few extra deck cards you can play. The obvious ones being the Rank 10 Trains and the Rank 5 removal monsters - but you also can run one copy of Chaos Gate Sunya. This is mostly a backup play just in-case your opponent somehow gets rid of Zexal with something like Lithosagym - but this could also just be a cheese way of OTK'ing your opponent. Its effect, in a few words, does a guaranteed 5000 burn damage on your next standby phase. Provided your opponent has 3000+ attack on field - you could kill them with just this card. Like I said, you most likely wont go into this, but it's just a fun play nonetheless.  Overall: this deck drives forward with a strong 9.1/10. The fact that you can summon Utopic Zexal so freely and still make an Eldlich board is mind blowing. If we ever get these cards imported into the TCG - I hate to break it to you but Zexal will definitely be getting the ban treatment.  Its just too powerful of a card, especially paired with one of the strongest meta decks this format. One of the cards I never got to play test was definitely magicians' souls. I think that it could help unclog those bricky hands - but the only problem would be resolving your combo and getting it off the field. But since the ratios are perfect as they are and the deck already performs incredibly, I decided to leave it out. Apologies for my slightly long hiatus and the seemingly rushed deck discussion. I kinda lost the passion for deck building and focussed on studying and spending more time with family. To make it up to you though I'll be posting some spicy new lists for May 2020 that you could all try at home. Good luck playing yugioh as the new king of bling and don't forget to stay home. Happy Quarantine!"

(This could be Deskbot 001. The plus is that you'd go +1 in the hand off of it, the minus is that it's a total brick if you ever see it)</li>  	<li>Special Moulinglacia. Hand loop is at 3.</li>  	<li>Synchro Jet Synchron and Moulinglacia into Ravenous Crocodragon, drawing a card. You can use it to help break boards as well going second.</li>  	<li>Discard a card to special Jet Synchron, then link it and Needlefibre away in Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, summoning 3 tokens. Note that since we drew a card in the combo this is still hand neutral, and can be done off of 1 card.</li>  	<li>Tribute Auroradon and a token to summon Blue Impala</li>  	<li>Using Blue Impala and the tokens make Jaculuslan. This also makes Deep Sea Diva a 1 card 5 card hand loop. If you have 1 more water extender, you can tribute that instead of a token to hand loop your opponent for 4 at this point.</li>  	<li>Using your synchros, Xyz summon True King of all Calamities</li> </ol> You've now hand looped your opponent for 3-4, gained all the information you need, and set up a skill drain you can fire off in your opponent's standby phase. You can then use whatever other cards you have in your hand to extend into other plays. You can even link into Marincess Coral Anemone before making Auroradon in order to bring the hand loop up to 4/5 by summoning Needlefibre from your gy after the combo and banishing it for Desert Locusts.  This uses only 5-7 cards in the extra deck to pull off (5 for the combo, plus Borreload Savage and Herald for additional Auroradon combos), freeing a lot of room up for old more traditional mermail combos compared to Linkross, which take 7-10 cards in the extra deck to do the same thing. This means Diva alone can end on 4 negates with Apollousa and Toad, or on Borreload Savage + Herald of the Arc Light, or True King of All Calamities (all taking cards from your opponents hand), or on a 5 card hand loop with Mecha Phantom Beast Jaculuslan."

It's very difficult to brick with it and the tuto is efficient. Made this deck because I love Endymion since his first release.  <strong>Plan A :</strong>  If you have <em>Mythical Beast Master Cerberus</em> in your hand, take a sit and it's winnable easily. Activate his effect in the pendulum zone to tuto <em>Mythical Beast Jackal King</em>. Activate his effect in pendulum zone and you got your <em>Cerberus </em>on the field. Try to activate magic card to feed him with counter and make him unkillable by using his effect.  <strong>Plan B :</strong>  <em>Mythical Bestiary, use it like a booby trap. </em> <strong>Plan C :</strong>  <em>Spell Power Mastery</em> is a good tuto that can provide you counter on each magical/pendulum monster.  <strong>Plan D :</strong>  <em>Endymion, The Mighty Master Of Magic </em>can be summoned very easily when you set your field with 6 counter (mythical beast monster gain 2 per 2 counters on them), plus, his effect is truly a killing joke (I will loose some friendship if I continu to play it), indeed, you can banish 6 cards on the field of your ennemy. ""Oh that's to bad""  <strong>Last but not least :</strong>  This deck can be played very easily, just seek what combo you want to do, is that pendulum summon with endymion's cards, is that tuto with mythical beast booby trap/mythical institution ? Or sacrifice your little magician to summon your beast from your hand ? <em>Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</em> is here to tuto some <em>Spellbook</em> or use the<em> Magical Dimension </em>card to summon what do you want from your hand.  <strong>Little tips :</strong>  If you were in a bad situation, don't forget your Xyz or <em>Mystical Space Typhoon</em>, <em>Hey, Trunade! </em>can provide you free counters by sending all spell, and save you from traps, in the hand. <em>Spellbook of Secrets </em>give you counters and <em>Spellbook of Power</em>, this is the most free counter tricks I saw lol. Don't forget to clean your pendulum side when you want to use mythical beast pendulum effect. <strong>Never forget your</strong> <em>Magical Citadel of Endymion</em>//<em>Endymion's Lab</em>, it's not a MUST HAVE, but it can give you rest for your counter.  This is the first and only deck I really created by my own, I love how it works."

Luckily, Secret Slayers gave us another control archetype, Eldlich. Eldlich has proven to be an extremely powerful and consistent deck that has an incredible grind game, and best of all-- it doesn't use it's normal summon what this allows us to do is essentially play two decks with one opening hand. The basic idea is that you will start off with your Evil-Eye plays and then follow up with Eldlich ones. Best case scenarios you're ending with a typical Eldlich board with an extra pop or negate, worse case scenario you baited your opponents hand-traps to secure your Eldlich plays.  Pros: <ol>  	<li>The Eldlixer cards are chain-able, so you can chain them to the activation of Serziel's maintenance cost to avoid losing advantage.</li>  	<li>Since after Domain's activation you do not really care if it stays on field, in fact very often, you want it in the grave to recycle Evil Eye of Selene it can be used as cost for Eldlich The Golden Lord's graveyard effect.</li>  	<li>Both deck's have a very similar play-style that boils down to: ""Sit on a big monster with protection while putting up disruption for your opponent until you can pivot into your otk monster. "" The decks hardly ever step on each other's toes, as they want to do similar things most of the time.</li>  	<li> You get to play Eldlich.</li> </ol> Cons: <ol>  	<li>Though the addition of Eldlich means the deck is wildly consistent, when it does brick it bricks pretty hard, typically when drawing too many Evil Eye's of Selene (hence the playing it at 2)</li> </ol>"

With Generaider as a backup strat, a","So, enough people have been asking for the decklist of the one-Halq four-negates-and-VFD-and-OTK combo I came up with that I decided to upload the more refined version. Long story short: It's a very consistent lockdown that, once put up, could only be brought down with a SuperPoly... but because it's so weak to disruption, about half the deck is dedicated to a Generaider backup strategy and generic disruption of my own.  This is a more refined version of a decklist I posted about a month ago, with some big improvements in the decklist and none in the actual combo.  (Quick breakdown: 20 one-card combo starters, 9 generaider field spells, 14 bricks, 17 disruptions)  ----------------------------  Basically, the whole deck exploits that Halqifibrax is a pseudo-FTK from only one card, and there's so very many cards that do that. So:  -60 cards instead of the usual 39 or 40. Normally, you want small decks so that you draw your best cards, but when you've got several dozen 'best cards', you want as large as you can to avoid drawing the combo bricks.  -Because you don't need to have more than one card for all this, you only need to use half your deck on this, which makes a whole bunch of room for disruptions and backup plays.  -Outside of generic disruption, there's basically only two options for non-normal-summoning, non-ED-using archetypes: Eldlich and Generaider. The advantage with Generaider is that it's *also* a one-card-starter archetype, so it leaves room for a heck-lot of disruption.  Hence, you have a deck that in a 5-card hand has an 88% chance of a pseudo-FTK, and a 57% chance of a Genraider Stage as backup, with an average of 1.4 disruption/going second cards."

""The Dark Magicians"" is normally your safest bet, as it can bring both ""Dark Magician"" and ""Dark Magician Girl"" to your field from anywhere. ""Dark Magical Soul"" and ""Eternal soul"" is a great combo that tends to shut down many opponents combos, and by using super poly, you can definitely do some major damage against other meta-decks.

Now the main card in the deck, dragon ravine, is a dragunity search, a foolish burial for dragons and extends your plays by a lot, just keep sending your tuners to the graveyard and revive them for easy synchros, leyvaten plays a big role in the deck, he can revive himself if there's a equipped dragunity monster on the field, equip a tuner from the gy and go on a level 10 synchro.  Other plays involves dux or senatus and kuse, normal summoning one of the winged beasts guarantees a level 6 or 8 synchro like luin for further plays with kuse, gae bulg for dispaching problem monsters that you can't destroy via effects, gae dearg for adding a level 4 or lower winged beast or dragon at the cost of sending one to the graveyard, vajrayana for other level 8 synchros and crystal wing for negation.  Another layer to the strategy is the dragon ruler in this deck, even at one copy this bad boy can help you in so many ways, searching a wind attribute monster if banished, a dragon type monser if discarded alongside another wind monster and self reviving and returning to the hand, lightning the dragon ruler of draft is for easily bringing out the big guy."

I also put a dragma engine in to deal with threats from the extra deck.,"Using the new Dragma cards as a toolbox, this deck can lock your opponent out of special summoning pretty easily and swarm the field with cyber angels. The Herald of Perfection is used as an omni-negate. what's good about it though is that is isn't once per turn, as long as you have a fairy in your hand. I dislike running too many impcantations as they brick if you don't have a ritual card in your hand. The extra deck is purely used for the Dragmas to destroy (except Herald of Mirage Lights) so don't try to get them on the board!  My rating:  Attack: 5/5  Defense: 4/5  Consistency: 3/5  Strong Against: General decks that love the extra deck, e.g. Salamangreat, Invoked  Weak Against: Altergeist, Mystic Mine Burn/Exodia  Dragma combo:  Activate Disciples of the Nadir, search for Ecclesia, sending Bastard to the GY  Normal summon Ecclesia, add Dogmatic Nation to the hand  Activate Dogmatic Nation so your opponent will risk losing a monster if they attack Ecclesia  End your turn. At the End Phase Bastard in the GY will activate, allowing you to SS Maximus Dragma from the deck.  &nbsp;  Vanity Lock combo:  Get any 2 impcantations onto the field, searching for Benten and/or Machine Angel Ritual if you don't have them  Ritual any monster using Benten as a tribute  Benten's effect now activates, adding a Vanity's Ruler to the hand  Normal summon Vanity's ruler, using the Impcantations as tributes.  Vanity's Ruler stops your opponent from Special Summoning completely, meaning he can't even use Kaijus to get rid of your monsters.  &nbsp;  Also, if you want to add in a Dragma engine into your deck, here it is :  1 Maximus Dragma  2-3 Ecclesia  3 Disciple of the Nadir  1 Dogmatic Nation  1-3 Bastard the Ashen Dragon  1 Psy-framelord Omega (for recycling your cards)  Any removal/versatility that your deck lacks, like N'tss for targeted destruction or Wind Pegasus for a Knightmare Unicorn-like effect.  Hope you like this deck and the Dragma engine! Have fun!"

Combo videos, explanation of Red-Eyes engine, and budget options in","<strong>Index:</strong>  <u>1 Intro</u>  <u>2 Red-Eyes Engine/cards</u>  <u>3 Combos</u>  <u>4 Budget options</u>  <u>5 Side Deck</u>  <strong> </strong>  <strong>1 Intro</strong>  This is a Dragon Link deck that does Dragon Link deck things but with a Red-Eyes twist added in. Namely, I’ve expanded the Red-Eyes engine in the deck to exploit Black Metal Dragon’s effect not being a hard once per turn. I’ve also updated the deck with Eternity Code’s Noctovision Dragon and found Room to add a couple Pot of Avarices. Pot of Avarice gives the deck a lot more recycling of resources to play longer games than a normal Dragon Link deck would be able to. I have also done an extensive number of test hands to determine that this deck is just as consistent as a conventional competitive Dragon Link deck while making stronger boards.  &nbsp;  <strong>2 Red Eyes Engine/cards</strong>  The Red-Eyes cards are present for the most part not to make a Red-Eyes board but to smooth out or slightly beef up conventional Dragon Link combos. The primary way the deck expects to acquire these cards is by sending Black Metal Dragon to the GY. Red-Eyes Malefic can be used to turn a Romulus into a Hieratic before the deck Dark locks itself. Red-Eyes Alternative exists if you draw the normal Red-Eyes or don’t have a field spell to play Malefic. Red-Eyes Fang with Chain can target Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and add another disruption onto your board.  &nbsp;  I took out Borreload Dragon for a Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon because it fit thematically and there are enough lvl7 monsters to summon him somewhat reliably. That said I’m not sold that this card is actually a good pick and can be replaced with another extra deck monster or the original Borreload Dragon if you aren’t sold on him either.  &nbsp;  <strong>3 Combos</strong>  Here are some Youtube videos of different combos you’ll be looking for in this deck and how to perform them (Each video is about a minute long). Notably these combos are all done with minimum resources and can end on stronger boards with more resources invested.  1 card combo with Black Metal Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TDyHNmjLwA</a>  2 card combo with Rokket and Noctovision Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSwGUosIoAo</a>  2 card combo with Rokket and Quick Launch  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BUC_x_3lBU</a>  2 card combo with Rokket and Absorouter Dragon  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny6Rl6a24V4</a>  Playlist with all Combos:  <a>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4wvY6W8_pobhm2edgCy0rZypqEcJbtdX</a>  <strong>4 Budget Options</strong>  3x <u>Dark Ruler No more</u> -&gt; Effect Veiler is a good budget handtrap  3x <u>Called by the Grave</u> -&gt; D.D. Crow. Doesn’t protect your combos but is a really strong affordable hand trap right now.  1x <u>Borreload Savage Dragon</u> -&gt; Draco Berserker of the Tenyi is much weaker but still provides a strong level 8 synchro disruption to end on.  1x <u>Borrelsword Dragon</u> -&gt; Borreload Dragon  1x <u>Red-Eyes Fang with Chain</u> -&gt; another Red-Eyes B. Dragon or else any other card you so choose. This card should be reprinted in Legendary Duelists: Season 1 so it should come down in price (hopefully).  &nbsp;  Other budget options: Borreload Excharge Dragon, and Borrelguard Dragon, the Topologic Monsters, Galaxy Satellite Dragon, Barricadeborg Blocker, Saryuja, Wee Witch’s Apprentice, and Booster Dragon.  <strong> </strong>  <strong>5 Side Deck</strong>  There are so many options for the side deck at the moment at so many different price points I felt that I didn’t want to hold the deck back or make it really expensive by trying to recommend a specific side deck. Feel free to use whatever tech cards you think are best for current meta.  &nbsp;"

Both of those cards are super easy to fetch, Time Wizard by using Fusion Deployment and Time Magus by Instant Fusion (can be via Verte too, means you can wipe the board anytime with 2 monsters). Going first, we use regular Halqifibrax/Auroradon combo for Borreload Savage and Herald of the Arc Light, while the going second strat has many ways to break the board. The Scrap lineup is very versatile, not only it can go to Halqifibrax, it also provides backup combo while can fetch Time Wizard via Desperado Barrel Dragon for further grindy game.  Mathematician, Scrap Recycler (free link 4 or Verte while searching Time Wizard), Jet Synchron, and Tuning are our starter, making us playing 11 starters. Ghost Ogre (Crossout target, can replace it depends on popularity), 2 )-Lion (ensures Auroradon effect), 2 Time Wizard (easily searchable, its effect aint that good too), Magicalized Fusion (free Time Magus for late game), One Day of Peace (prevents damage from both Time Magus and Wizard), 3 Second Coin Toss (for big brain gamble), Millenium Eyes Restrict (negate discarded monster handtrap), Borreload Dragon (non-targeting non-destruction monster removal), Auroradon (combo piece, non-targeting destruction), Scrap Wyvern (backup combo, non-targeting destruction), Secure Gardna (prevents taking damage, summoned via Linkuriboh), Linkuriboh (enables Jet Synchron to Halqifibrax).  <img src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/0/06/JoeyWheelerDSOD-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Super consistent, great going first or second while still have follow up play, have big slot for staples.  Cons: Both Time Magus and Wizard are gamble."

If you don't, just use them to summon our deck boss Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL, and force your opponent to quarantine. And if you had the Generaider Boss Stage, don't worry and use it, so in the opponent turn you can summon a Generaider Boss of your choice and up to 4 Generaider Tokens; you can use the tokens either to use the effects of the Generaider Bosses or to Summon the Trias Hierarchia, Tributing 3 of those tokens you are able to destroy 1 enemy card and also draw 2 Cards.  Another useful combo is summoning Accesscode Talker, if you had in your hand the Effect Veiler, you can normal summon him, and if you already had a monster on the field you can Link Summon the Crystron Halqifibrax, and due to their effect you can bring another Effect Veiler, from you, deck or graveyard, and if you do, use them to special summon Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians, but be aware that you need at least 3 spell cards in the field or both players graveyard, so, you can bring back the Effect Veiler and use them to Link Summon the Accesscode Talker, active their effect in Selene' in order to gain 3000 atk points, and he is also able to destroy up to  2 cards on the field by banishing the 2 link monsters used in this combo. this is a generic combo, but very effective though.  <strong>Deck:</strong> Numeron Generaider Boss. <strong>Type:</strong> Lockdown, <em>OTK</em>. <strong>Difficulty:</strong> 5/10. <strong>Handiness/Consistency:</strong> 6/10 (the first turn matter? yes. How many cards do you need to extract 100% of this deck? 2 initial cards. It is easily counterable? yes). <strong>Draw power: </strong>4/10, Conditional (can I use pot of desires? no). <strong>Recovery:</strong> 2/10. <strong>Comeback:</strong> 4/10. ""This deck is recommended for Medium duelists, <strong>Average final turn: 5</strong>"".  <strong>The perfect initial hand at the first turn:</strong> Numeron Network, Generaider Boss stage, Trias Hierarchia, Memories of Hope, and 1 bait card -like terraforming or planet pathfinder. <strong>The perfect initial hand at Second turn:</strong> Numeron Network, Generaider Boss stage, Dark Ruler no More, Nibiru the primal being, Lightning Storm, and Memories of hope.  so, as you can see, all we need is Numeron Network and Generaider Boss stage, and both are field spells that can be easily searched, by cards like terraforming, planet pathfinder, numeron wall, generaider boss fight, etc.  I hope everyone could enjoy this guide, I pretend to make more guides in the future, If you want to make constructive criticism or add more information, feel free to comment below!

Activate your Ritual, summon Idaten using Diviner as a tribute.  Diviner's effect activates as it was tributed; summon Cyber Petit Angel from the deck.  Chain Idaten's effect and add Machine Angel Absolute Ritual to the hand.  Activate Petit angel's effect, add Vrash to the hand.  Ritual summon Vrash with Cyber Petit Angel, Idaten and Diviner in the GY.  Idaten's effect activates, turning your Vrash into a 4k beatstick permanently.  Note that adding 1000 atk to Vrash isn't Vrash's effect, so using impermanence or veiler won't remove it. one of the ways to stop this is by activating Called by the Grave to banish Idaten after the Ritual summon.  &nbsp;  Dragma combo:  Activate Disciples of the Nadir, search for Ecclesia, sending Bastard to the GY  Normal summon Ecclesia, add Dogmatic Nation to the hand  Activate Dogmatic Nation so your opponent will risk losing a monster if they attack Ecclesia  End your turn.

Has a very high ceiling when you open power cards such as Brilliant Fusion, Last Will, and Adamancipator excavations  Can stun very well with Ties of the Brethren and Koa'ki Meiru <h3><strong><em>Weaknesses:</em></strong></h3> Can open very bricky hands (Solid Bricks)  Very GY depended deck; Called by and Cosmic Cyclone hurt the deck a lot <h3><em>Trinities:</em></h3> 2x Last Will (Extra Unlimited Card)  2x Brilliant Fusion (Extra Unlimited Card)  2x Adamancipator Researcher (Extra Unlimited Card) <h3>Comments:</h3> Union combo is summoning Union Carrier while you still control a Rock-type Monster and equipping Block Dragon from the deck  The deck can do unfair plays such as ending on multiple Xyzs/Synchros if you get luckly with the Adamancipator  Beta The Electromagnet Warrior is a 1 card Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior with 1 pop on summon (takes 2 turn) <ol>  	<li>Normal Beta, Search Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior</li>  	<li>On the opponent's turn use Beta to tag out into Delta The Magnet Warrior, use its effect to foolish Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior</li>  	<li>On your turn summon Alpha search Berserkion, banish Gamma, Beta, Alpha from the field/gy to summon him from hand and banish Delta to pop a card (not once per turn)</li> </ol> The Side decked rocks are all searchable with Gallant Granite and can be summoned with Super Team Buddy Force Unite!  Doki Doki is also a recruiter that summons from deck, with a low cost and can be used as an extender  Brilliant Fusion doubles as a free body as well as a foolish for all rocks/Painful Decision  Ties of the Brethren works as a combo finisher (at the end of Union Combo) or as a stun option (worth spending Trinitys on if you want to toolbox)  Last Will helps with Union Combo and toolboxing from deck  Adamancipator Risen - Dragite is a blowout card that can break boards (and gains protection form Block Dragon)  Barrier Statue of the Drought + Koa'ki Meiru Overload is to much for most non Earth decks to handle, and you can turn off your own Barrier by turning it into Gallant"

You can change out the Sky Striker cards, I just used them and they seemed like an extra utility just in case your opponent tried to stop your play. You can also change out Monster Reborn for World Legacy Succession because you can search for it with Worl Legacy - World Crown, but even though that's there, Monster Reborn seemed more versatile than Succession because it doesn't limit you to special summoning to a zone a link monster points to. Back to the Sky Striker cards, the links can be replaced with other cards like Borrelsword Dragon or another boss monster. But normally with this deck, you won't have a turn 3 because you will most likely OTK your opponent.</span>"

It is a really good card that literally is an instant Holly angel because it provides 2 tokens. Otherwise it can be used for  more burning if you already have an angel on the field. You can use Set Rotation or Terraforming to get a mystic mine or Trickstar Light Stage to the field, whichever one you need. A play I like to make is using Set Rotation to set Light Stage to my field and Mine to the other when my opponent has more monsters. This way They will either have to activate Mine to get rid of Light Stage, blocking all attacks and monster effects from him, or leave the Mine set, not allowing him to destroy Light Stage.  My Rating:  Attack: 3/5  Defense: 4/5  Consistency: 4/5  Strong Against: Adamancipator, Exodia  Weak against: True Draco, Vanity  Combos:  Cards in hand: Trickstar Fez, Trickstar Candina  Activate Fez, summoning 2 tokens  Link summon Holly Angel with the tokens  Normal summon Candina into a zone Holly angel points to, allowing the 200 damage  Activate Candina's effect, add Light Stage to the hand  Activate Light Stage and add Lilybell to the hand  Chain Lilybell's effect to Special summon herself to a zone Holly angel points to, dealing 200 damage + another 200 Lightstage damage  Link Lilybell into Bloom, doing 400 damage  Link Candina and Bloom into Crimson Heart, dealing 400 damage  Activate Crimson Heart if you want to, but it won't yield 2 cards  Link them all into a Bella Madonna, then activate her effect to do 1000 damage + another 200 damage from Light Stage  Total damage: 200 + 400 + 400 + 400 + 1000 + 200 =2600 damage  &nbsp;  This deck is a very fun deck to play.

Although the deck doesn't consist of incredibly powerful cards that can win the game in a single attack, it requires careful placement and an effective plan of attack to use effectively.  Atlantean Attack Squad and Mystical Space Typhoon are effective at keeping the board clean while you attempt to build your forces. In the event where Atlantean Attack Squad is destroyed, it can be recovered by using salvage.  A Legendary Ocean and Tornado wall are the driving point of this deck, protecting your weaker monsters such as Starfish and Jellyfish while you prepare to Xyz or tribute summon for Shark Drake or Hyper-Ancient Shark Megalodon.  Before battling take note that Hyper-Ancient Shark is a CRUCIAL unit as its ability to destroy a monster you opponent controls after dealing damage can deal with monsters that are a great deal stronger then it. if it can attack any monster on the field, fish depth charge can deal with them for you or you can power up Megalodon with aqua-jet"

Also Dark Ruler No More is GG vs This Deck.

Having Toon Kingdom makes it easier to keep the Toon Cyber Dragons on the field and cards like Toon Table of Contents and Toon Mask help get them on the field faster. Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon is another good target in this deck and has a few different ways of coming to the field through the Red-Eyes Toon Dragons and Toon Dark Magician. Toon Masked Sorcerer is great because he is protected by Toon Kingdom's effect and helps you +1 in card advantage. Toon Dark Magician Girl is valuable because this is the only toon card right now that can attack on the turn its summoned giving a little boost in speed to the way this deck can be played which is very important because Toon Chaos which claims to speed the Toon archetype up has not released yet. With Fang of Critias I have paired Mirror Force, Crush Card Virus and Ring of Destruction. I love running these in my deck because they have great effects and are easy to bring out. At the worst case scenario I just end up using the trap card by themselves since they are still strong staple cards. Abyss Dweller is in the extra deck as well for disruption and is easily brought to the field using the level 4 monsters that are about half of the monsters in the deck. Downerd Magician is also here in the case that I need to get a bigger monster on the field then  what I have access to at that time. This deck is a work in progress and will end up changing when toon Chaos comes out most likely. I also put comic hand in the side deck purely because I don't know what to get rid of but i know its an important card in a toon deck  PLEASE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR CRITIQUES ARE WELCOME!!!"

(TCG banlist),"This is a combo deck designed to go second and FTK from Crystron Halqifibrax while also clearing the opponent's field or setting up for negates. The combo requires at least one card on the opponent's field that can be targeted, or a clear field, and one card in the hand (which will be discarded and replaced). The combo goes as followed:  -Summon Halqifibrax, get O-Lion  -Summon Auroradon using Halqifibrax and O-Lion, use Auroradon and O-Lion's effects to get 4 tokens (if you have a Mecha Phantom Beast in your hand at this time, do not use O-Lion's effect).  -Summon Megaraptor from the deck by tributing 2 tokens  -Add Coltwing to your hand by tributing a token, then banish O-Lion to Normal Summon it  -Summon Ebon Illusion Magician using Coltwing and Megaraptor, then use its effect to detach Coltwing and get Magicalibra  -Summon Yazi using Magicalibra and the other token, then use Yazi's effect to destroy itself and an opponent's card, and summon Mare Mare from the deck  -Use Mare Mare's effect to bring out 3 tokens, and summon Accel Synchron using Mare Mare and a token  -Send Junk Synchron from the deck to the GY to increase Accel Synchron's level, then summon Baxia with Accel Synchron and the other tokens  -Send Baxia (if you do not plan to summon Satellite Warrior or Dingirsu) or Ebon Illusion Magician (if you do) to the GY with Baxia's effect to bring back Coltwing and get 2 tokens  -Discard a card to summon Jet Synchron from the GY, then summon Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 Burei using Jet Synchron and the tokens  -Summon Karakuri Komachi mdl 224 Ninishi with Burei's effect. If you have Ninishi in your hand (for combos that will end in Satellite Warrior) or Karakuri Gama mdl 4624 Shirokunishi (for combos that will end in Borreload Savage Dragon) in your hand, use Ninishi's effect to normal summon it.  -Summon another Burei using Ninishi and Coltwing  -Summon Shirokunishi with Burei's effect  -Summon Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X Bureido in defense position using Burei and Shirokunishi  -Use Bureido's effect to get Ninishi (if you want to get Satellite Warrior) or Shirokunishi (if you want to get Borreload Savage Dragon)  -Banish Shirokunishi to change Bureido's battle position and draw a card.  -Synchro summon using the Karakuri tuner you summoned and Burei. Get Borreload Savage Dragon if you summoned Shirokunishi, or Satellite Warrior if you summoned Ninishi. If you summon Borreload Savage Dragon, equip Halqifibrax to it from the GY.  -(Optional): Summon Dingirsu using Bureido and Baxia to send an opponent's card to the GY.  -Attack directly with the monsters you have Summoned. You should be able to do at least 8450 damage.  Two of each card that need to be summoned from the deck (not the hand) are included so drawing one does not ruin the combo.  Most main deck cards that are not part of the combo aim to prevent cards like Ash Blossom from shutting down the combo. Extra copies of Dragged Down and Exchange should be side decked in for most games, as many decks would side in Nibiru at this point."

Most importantly: no ritual package because it is trash (more on this later).  Some comments on my deck build: <ul>  	<li>Limitations. This is a going 2nd deck. 3x Lightning Storm and 3x Evenly Matched are great choices. Lightning Storm is great because it can out weird floodgates if you really have to, and Evenly Matched is great to because even though it skips battle phase, your main combo has a pop 3 spells + pop 3 monsters so it is worth skipping out on the OTK. Budget alternatives would be 1x Raigeki, 2x Dark Hole and 3x Book of Eclipse (nice tech imo, non targeting non destructive!).</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial Goods for extra access to field spell (see 2nd effect field spell). Once you have the field spell active it is soo good. If they pop it, then you reset it with literally any opening monster. They banish it, you might be able to recover it with A.I.dle Reborn. What matters in the end of the day is more consistent acces to it.</li>  	<li> I think A.I. Love Fusion is heavily underrated. Not only is it a ---non-targeting non destructive non monster effect--- removal of a link monster (e.g. Apollouse/Avramax etc.), but also the Earth Golem @Ignister has a Borrelsword like effect beating over pretty much any monster (+ it floats!).</li>  	<li>Card Destruction is a tech which I do not see in other builds of this deck. I love it though! I mean, you can literally recover any monster OR in archetype spell from graveyard using Doyon @Ignister, + you are actually incentiviced to send the field spell, since you can reset it using its 2nd effect from grave.</li>  	<li>Called by Grave is a must. Sometimes you MUST need that access to fthe ield spell, which is facilitated by this card. Infinite impermanence does not do much against this deck. Nibiru is kryptonite though.</li>  	<li>Linkross is NICE. I mean, it makes the deck soo much more versatile. I will not go into the details of my combos but to give some examples, the tokens spammed from Linkross can be used for A.I. Love Fusion (Diplexer Chimera), Linkuriboh in grave or Hiyari @Ignister's effect.</li>  	<li>Firewall Dragon Darkfluid Darkfluid for if you have to go first. Pikari + Achichi is a Firewall Dragon with 3 counters in the main monster zone (try to figure this one out hah, hint: search Doshin from Achichi). Also, it is one of the few cards that outs hard boards like Avramax due to its effect being available in battle phase.</li> </ul> Finally some last comments: <ul>  	<li>No ritual package. Its just trash. Simply due to the fact that you have to run 2 HARD bricks (in that drawing 1 stops the whole combo), + Cyberse Witch is only live with a spell in grave.</li>  	<li>I have left open some extra deck spots in case you wish to optimize/build on the current build.</li>  	<li>Some side deck suggestions like There Can Be Only One are provided. Do with it as you wish.</li> </ul> Lastly, please leave a comment(s) on what you think of my build! I am constantly looking to improve, tips and criticism are more than welcomed!

Konami tends not to hit new archetypes directly unless absolutely necessary, for example Zoodiacs had to because they were tier 0 upon release.  Play this deck before it gets hit by the banlist!

I hope not.,"Well, you no longer need Links in order to summon more than one Extra Deck monster, so that means I'm able to update my god awful Goblin deck to be more consistent. Isolde and most of the equip spells (Still running Moon Mirror cuz I'm dedicated to PLOOOOOOOSING and it helps to out some big scaries) have been ditched, along with any other Links I might've been running (I'm so sorry, Brute Enforcer). The only Link we play now is Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, because this deck is going to play the long game either way, so I figure I may as well play something to reward me for my patience. We're also playing a lot more cards that help with going first, namely Raflasia and her Hole (I chose Bottomless) and Giant Hand, because through extensive testing I've determined this deck can't play through negates for beans. Go first, summon Raflasia/Giant Hand (Depends on whether you open a Hole or not), try to pivet into different Xyz or Synchros depending on what your opponent has as you go along, get some damage off with your PLOOOSERS when you can, and pray you aren't blown out of the water completely before you can summon Megaclops or just swing for game in general.  Also not playing Utopia Double because I'm not a COWARD."

","I play on Dueling Nexus, and I was in the editor, adding Knightmare Unicorn and Knightmare Phoenix to the extra deck of the deck I was working on, when something caught my eye while I was typing. In Dueling Nexus, there is a little icon on the card if the card is TCG or OCG exclusive, Rush Duel exclusive, etc.. I wasn't typing particularly fast, so I saw an OCG icon pop up. Now, whenever I post a Deck (save this one), I try to test it a LOT. As long as I win a certain number of games and don't constantly get bricks, I'll be good with it. I have Knightmare Unicorn and Phoenix in my Extra Deck in a LOT of my decks, especially unpublished ones, because they're good generic Link Monsters. Point is, I see the different cards with kni, then knig, then knigh, (and so on and so forth), VERY often. So, I go check the new card out, and this archetype is what I was greeted with. I'm not sure when these guys got added to Dueling Nexus, but I hope I'm not late to the party. Usually, I would try to perfect a Deck before publishing it, but this Deck is a little more complicated than most, and one of the cards might be bugged. Here's my inital version of the deck. I might post a more Meta version later, if I can make it work."

The primary focus is to use <a data-name=""melody of awakening dragon"">Melody of Awakening Dragon</a> too bring some blue eyes cards to your hand, and either use <a data-name=""fusion sage"">fusion sage</a> and/or <a data-name=""polymerization"">polymerization</a> to create the legendary <a data-name=""blue-eyes alternative ultimate dragon"">blue-eyes alternative ultimate dragon</a>, or use <a data-name=""delta flyer"">delta flyer</a> and some of the other tuners to summon one of the powerful synchro monsters! You can, of course, simply dominate with blue eyes, although it is a normal monster, and by today's standards it's kind of weak as a stand-alone monster. <a data-name=""Blue-eyes alternative white dragon"">Blue-eyes alternative white dragon</a>, is, however, slightly more powerful, with the ability to destroy cards. An easy way to get it to the field is to add it to your hand (if you don't already have it) with melody of awakening dragon, adding blue-eyes alternative, as well as a regular blue eyes to reveal, therefor, special summoning alternative dragon. <a data-name=""Nimble momonga"">Nimble momonga</a>, is a card that I don't see very often in blue-eyes decks, mostly because it's main purpose is for summoning monsters that need 2 or more tributes, and although blue-eyes does need 2 tributes to summon, there is clearly many more easier ways so special summon it, however, Nimble momonga is nice for LP gain, and if you have a blue-eyes in your hand, but no other way to summon it than plain old tributing. <a data-name=""Red-eyes darkness metal dragon"">Red-eyes darkness metal dragon</a> is a card that I didn't really use, until recently, and I realize now, that it is a kick-butt card! It is super easy to summon, and allows you to bring back your dragons from the graveyard, or summon one from your hand! Super awesome! Getting cards to the graveyard is usually pretty easy, but to make it simpler, I added <a data-name=""foolish burial"">foolish burial</a>, which allows you so send a monster straight from the deck to the grave! This card can either be used to send <a data-name=""white stone of ancients"">white stone of ancients</a> to the graveyard, to activate it's effect, or you can send any old monster to the graveyard, and special summon it with either red-eyes darkness metal's effect, or with <a data-name=""monster reborn"">monster reborn</a>, which can be brought back and used again with <a data-name=""ankuriboh"">ankuriboh</a>'s helpful ability. I am also now realizing as i'm writing this that it would have been simpler to just add dragon shrine, but i'm lazy, so i'm just gonna leave it as it is with foolish burial. Another card I decided to skip out on was silver's cry, I decided on <a data-name=""return of the dragon lords"">return of the dragon lords</a> instead, because that card works for more than just blue-eyes, and has multiple uses with it. You can add dragon shrine and/or silver's cry if you want. They would make great editions to this deck :) I have also added <a data-name=""trade in"">trade in</a>, which is an awesome card for this deck, because it allows you to draw, and discarding one of your monsters doesn't really matter, considering, as said before, we have ways to get them back. The final cards I should mention, are <a data-name=""chaos form"">chaos form</a> and b<a data-name=""lue-eyes chaos MAX dragon"">lue-eyes chaos MAX dragon</a>. I added these cards because MAX dragon is AWESOME! High attack, immunity to effects, and that double piercing damage is SWEET! It needs a high level monster or a blue eyes to summon it, but luckily, we have many of those! I hope you enjoy this deck. If you have the cards, make it! If you don't, you can make it on Dueling nexus, try it out! Edit it! I hope this wasn't too long, this is the first deck I made (the first good deck, I had an old account), so yeah... :)  &nbsp;  If you have any tips on what to add, feel free to add them in the comments, or make your own deck with those edits.

With the new Numerons releasing, they finally have an answer. This deck is split into 2 parts. The Numeron part is what I will call ""Plan A."" With multiple ways to search out Numeron Network, it should be your main goal. However, there are still ways you should go about baiting any Ash Blossoms your opponent might have. This is also where the Timelords, or ""Plan B"", come in. If done right, your opponent will assume you're playing just regular Timelords, and as such, try and hit those cards specifically. Time Maiden is the perfect Ash Blossom bait as searching any of your Timelords can be very strong. If it does bait an Ash, you're still free to search out your Numeron Network and switch to that mode. Going first, your best bets are ending on Zexal, Apollusa, or Megaclops. Going second, you can either try and otk with the Numerons, put down Megaclops if your opponent has no Xyzs, or summon one of the Borrel dragons. If all else fails and they shut down your Numeron strategy, you can still fall back on ""Plan B"" and just try finishing them off with Timelords.  [Notable Plays] -Time Maiden to bait Ash Blossoms. -Summoning Timelords to bait monster negation, then sending them to the grave with Advance Draw to clear the field for Numeron Calling. -Using Maiden as Twin-Twister fodder in order to be able to banish her for a Timelord. Summoning Metaion while you have Megaclops out is very powerful as it'll be immune to Metaion's bounce effect. -If in a mirror match, try to either Ash the Numeron Network, or Imperm the Zexal. If they do get Zexal out, remember you can still summon so just putting a Timelord on the field to stall can often be enough."

The main goal of this deck is to get cards like endymion +a spell counter card and mythical beast Jackal king to negate spells, traps, and monster affect when you need to. I will not be demonstrating a combo due to the fact you get negation power due to what your opponent does. I left the side deck open because it is always fluctuating due to the current meta decks, and people will likely use their personal preferences.  This deck takes time to learn and master and I do not believe that I have done that yet so comments and critique are very welcome."

Main strategy is to cycle cards in hand to get perfection and others on the field. Best opening card is diviner, and pitching Arc to search whatever missing piece you have. If you have a combination of Idaten, Benten, or Machine Angel Ritual, summon Idaten by pitching Benten, then search dawn via idaten and perfection via benten. If you are leading into this from the diviner play, you can add absolute and vrash to get vrash on the field with 4000 atk. Also cycling idaten tributes, via ritual or merciful, will get you big walls/beat sticks with Perfection and Vrash. Quick note: Learned this the hard way, but Natasha can only use GY effect after being ritual summoned."

The deck all round does well against the meta, especially adamancipator for obvious reasons and being able to play through its negates going second. The deck doesnt do that well against Eldlich and megaliths bar the synchro version of Eldlich were the match up isnt so bad. Shaddoll invoked can really go either way."

Does pretty well. Omni HEROES.,"I dunno. Just go second and go for an OTK. Summon Solid Soldier, then SS Stratos. Either add Faris, or if you have Faris in the hand, add Drawhand. When fusing into Sunrise, use Solid Soldier and Drawhand. Then summon Drawhand from the grave using Solid Soldier. Before doing all that, you need to link into Wonder Driver.

Do you want to combo off with dinos AND resolve servant in a 60 card deck? Me neither; but you can! The Pend G,"Disclaimer: I did not make this list. This horrifyingly beautiful array of cards was produced by Trif Gaming during one of his live streams on youtube. While I did suggest some cards that are played here - I very happily do not claim ownership of this build. With that being said: here's the self-proclaimed 'Free Win.deck' or as the majority calls it, Trif's Pendulum Pick N' Mix!  Where do I even start..? On his recent stream, Trif Gaming got drunk decided that it was time he revealed the real best deck. He knew it would be controversial; that it would change the way yugioh is played forever, and flip the format on its head. The people called it the Anti-Meta Meta Deck of 2020. Wars were cancelled. Televisions stopped broadcasting. The world stood still and time froze.....are all things I would've said. I'm gonna be honest this is just a bunch of engines thrown together with the focus of turboing out Halqifibrax. I don't know how this deck manages to work its so perplexing. Here's how the basic combo works:  Using one of your several starters in the deck - you find a way to get into Crystron Needlefiber. Once it's been summoned, you do your standard synchro climbing (drawing off of cards like Formula Synchron, Coral Dragon and the level 9 whose name became overly complicated in the TCG) until you manage to make True King of all Calamities. Because of how overtly complex this deck actually is, you will mostly likely waste 12 of your extra deck slots just trying to pull off the combo. Once you do however, you'll realise that you've been left with the rest of your hand and an unused pend summon. Hmm, maybe this is the real best deck after all..? From this point on you basically make do with what you have. Usually the only things worth it are summoning an Ultimate Conductor Tyranno for its spicy flip effect, and using Servant of Endymion to summon a Mighty Master. If you do not open any of these however: do not worry. Pendulum are known for their amazing draw ability. In this...cluster of cards, you run a total of 12 different draw spells! Thats right! And not only that, 22 card that search. Despite this being sixty cards: you'll find what your looking for. Or not. Desires can be irritating I get your pain.  If you feel daring enough, you can tweak some of the ratios in the Extra Deck. I'd mainly advise sticking to Selene, Accesscode and Cerberus - as you go into them the least and they are not imperative for the combo. Selene is the least-used one, because its primarily there only to summon out a Mighty Master after its been used for souls. Cerberus is also pretty interchangeable. You can replace it with another link 2 or Phoenix if you really want, but the people decided that it was the most impactful Knightmare this format. And Accesscode talker is only there to OTK and blow your opponents board up. I would try to keep Accesscode over something like Borrelsword, solely because its harder to resolve its effect and OTK during the same turn. Plus Accesscode can technically be made with 3 materials using something like Selene and a spellcaster summon from the GY.  Overall: this deck is like a 4.2/10 who am I kidding. I wouldn't recommend taking this to a legitimate tournament unless your aspiration is to go X-5 and get laughed at. The deck is consistent yeah, but its recovery is too poor for it to be any form of good. It falls flat to handtraps and has too many choke-points in the combo. The only reason I made this upload was mostly as filler and to have a little fun. The stream this was made on was really late at night, so not many people got to see the deck in action. I also wanted to get my next few decks prepared because i'm going to try to get back to daily decklists starting from Friday. Don't forget to check out Trif Gaming too: he posts some cool Pendulum lists on his channel and does a lot of fun interactive streams a lot of the time. Even though its not that optimal, I'd recommend you still try out the deck. Its very fun and feels pretty rewarding once you manage to make the endboard. Have a great evening/night/morning/day and dont forget to Tune in tsoon to catch some <em>actual </em>good decks."

This deck sports plenty of draw power and damage without opening itself up to S/T destruction vulnerability. Nearly every Trap card can be chained to any attempt to destroy it.  Digging into the build, the first part of the deck is 3 Mystic Mines, 1 Metaverse and 2 Demise of Land. The reason I am not running 3 Demise of Land or 1 Terraforming is because of consistency issues. Having a 3:3 ratio on cards that can search for Metaverse reduces the risk of bad opening hands. An ideal ""going first"" opening hand will have one search card and no physical copies of Mystic Mine. A single Field Barrier is in the deck to protect Mystic Mine from destruction.  Moving over, we get to the cards that draw. Be careful with Pot of Extravagance. It is a good card to play if you have a Pot of Duality in hand, but if you have several other draw cards, play those instead. Card of Demise is easy to play due to the heavy S/T usage. If you have Swift Scarecrow in hand, though, it is okay to hold off for a turn to play it. Contract With Don Thousand is an incredibly overlooked card for burn decks that stall or any deck that needs to tighten up its consistency a bit. It can also lock the opponent out of their Normal Summons if played strategically. It could be a consideration for trimming back the deck a bit in favor of a Watch Dog if you find yourself getting clogged hands with it often. The 1000 damage to each player is nice, and can even finish off an opponent or push for a tie in dire times. Consider using this with Firecracker and Chain Strike for a strong finishing-blow. Balance of Judgement is here to stock up your hand after a non-fatal push. It is not uncommon to draw 4 cards with it if played after unleashing a series of S/Ts on the enemy. This is probably the easiest card to side out if needed.  Next, we come to the damage dealing S/T cards. These are my personal picks for high-damage output. I find Ceasefire and Just Desserts are great for ending a game. If you ever find yourself with 4 of these at any time, you are probably in a position to push for the win. Of course it is more likely that you will need to rely on other damage sources as well, so don't worry too much about amassing all of your damage at once. Cauldron of the Old Man replaces Wave-Motion Cannon as the <em>de facto </em>Continuous Spell damage king. It can also provide a small health boost if you are unable to deal damage for any reason, including if you played One Day of Peace before playing this card. This also provides a useful distraction for splitting an opponent's S/T destruction. Chain Strike should be saved until it can do the most damage or until you can finish an opponent off with it.  Now we get to the stall cards. Waboku, Threatening Roar and Swift Scarecrow can be really irritating to face off against, as even if the opponent manages to get rid of Field Barrier and Mystic Mine, these cards can be there waiting to give full protection for the rest of the turn. Additionally, the trap cards can be used to ""poor-man"" a chain together for Chain Strike damage in a pinch. I have, myself, used Swift Scarecrow, chained Waboku, chained Threatening Roar, chained Balance of Judgement to ultimately end with Chain Strike and deal a respectable 2000 damage and end a game. It is also important to remember that Waboku and Threatening Roar can be activated if targeted for destruction themselves. Though rare, you can also use Waboku if another card is targeted by Night Beam and then chain that card to Waboku to bypass the ""you cannot activate the targeted card in response"" part of the effect.  The last card is Magic Jammer. It is pretty straightforward as a layer of protection for Mystic Mine, but it also has value when used on Cauldron of the Old Man. Not only does it provide protection, but it also provides the same type of counter that Cauldron of the Old Man uses to calculate damage/recovery. This might seem nominal, but it is worth noting. Also, if Mystic Mine and Field Barrier are both on the field, Field Barrier is the better choice for protection, as it passes that protection to Mystic Mine and continues to stop the opponent from playing their own Field Spell.  The extra deck is more-or-less intended to be used for Pot of Extravagance. That doesn't mean that you can't find niche uses for it, however. If your opponent uses anything that can generate tokens on your field, you can use the Extra Deck to keep your numbers low. Decks running Black Garden are the biggest perpetrator of this scenario.  The Side Deck is just what I am using right now. It should evolve with the meta to account for any weaknesses you might find in the deck. I have an alternative build that removes the ten burn cards to change into a passive deck out deck, so there are a lot of options for the side. Find what works for your ""play environment""."

What if you wanted to see how fast and stylishly you can race to the 500 tables? What if you wanted to, rather than win every game you play, try to <em>lose</em> every game you play, in the most artful and combo-reliant way possible?</span>  <span>With this deck profile, I hope to do just that. Introducing the first build of the <strong>Gale Dogra SelFTK!</strong></span>  <span>The way I went about building the deck is that I set some basic guidelines when building a SelFTK deck, which are as follows:</span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong>No surrendering.</strong> That sorta defeats the purpose of making a deck in the first place, y’know? And if your opponent gets the resources for a legit win against you because you bricked, then it’s customary to sit there and take it.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong>No draws. </strong>There’s a reason Konami banned Self-Destruct button from tournaments, and if this sorta thing blows up I don’t want to be responsible for a whole TON of ruling knightmares.</span></li> </ol> <span>The idea behind it is simple enough: use all sorts of discard and draw cards to access Gale Dogra. then use it’s effect to clear out most of your lifepoints before going into Verte Anaconda to mill a fusion spell and secure yourself the Big L. We achieve this ideal combo by using Goblindberg to summon itself and GD to set everything up for going into Verte, or failing that we use a whole plethora of Danger! monsters to both put bodies on the board and dig for GD.</span>  <span>There is an alternative, but less fun backup combo to use Gale Dogra to send a Herald of the Arc Light and get a Impcantation Chalislime into the hand, summon another Impcantation through it’s in-hand effect, and then passing turn to take more than enough damage to clinch the loss. And if THAT fails, then you at least have a few floodgates that can help you stall for at least a turn to hopefully find a way to get a Dogra on the board.</span>  <span>The main weak point of the deck right now is that there is no reliable way to get GD on the field without having to do more work than it’s worth, and the entire idea of the deck works best when your opponent is unaware that you’re trying to give the win to them. So going into an overly complicated combo for that GD might face some heavy disruption to end your turn early, and we don’t want our opponent to destroy us! We can destroy ourselves just fine, thank you very much!</span>  <span>This is currently a pretty rough deck since it’s basically an entirely new strategy, so advice for future build and other ideas for SelFTK decks would be greatly appreciated!</span>"

These are the essential cards that will give your chance of victory.

Despite having many cards, this is an easy-to-use deck to get the card you need, either with the help of the Humid Winds trap, or with Jasmine (Link), Lonefire Blossom also helps a lot in quick summons, and learn to correctly use all the effects of each monster, especially Angelica (single tuner monster). To guarantee your victory, always hold a ""Dark Ruler No More"" in your hand and for the protection of your monsters count on the Fairy Box.  Well, I think that's it.

This deck is a combination of Machinas and Infinitracks, with a bit of rank 10 train support added in. These three archetypes have incredible consistency, as they are all earth machines and don't lock each other out of summoning. The strategy would be to use Machina air carrier or Megaform to get out citadel, which can nuke your opponent and bring itself back easily. The superdreadnoughts are easy to bring out, what with the trains and railroad stampede. Then you cana get liebe from either of the superdreadnoughts, which can easily get itself to over 8000 attack. It has no built-in protection, but that can easily be fixed with Infinitrack goliath and outrigger extension, both of which are searchable. With all of these Xyz Monsters, it is relatively easy to bring out Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, which in this current meta is nightmarishly difficult to remove. The searchers in this deck are Machina metalcruncher, Infinitrack Harvester, Machina redeployment, Machina air carrier, and revolving switchyard. Finally, infinitrack tunneller can recycle things in the graveyard, and lets you draw two cards at the same time. The seven sins is summoned by using Harvester and Anchor Drill, and is a 4k beatstick with good removal effects and protection.  The extra deck cards are replaceable if you think you have a better idea, but I recommend keeping infinitrack goliath and the the superdreadnoughts.

Then go into decode talker, which will have its arrows filled with what the white stone of ancients summons. Hopefully you can go into XYZ or more link summons the next turn. There are several negates present, and so many effects it usually overwhelms hand traps, but be careful of Nibiru.

Most Tenyi monster is also lvl 4 which means Gallant Granite can consistently makes its Halq play because they are free summon just like Burning Abyss and even have their own tuner. But the Halq combo we use is to avoid bringing light/dark attribute since its the attribute we wanna lock our opponent from.  Combo is we make Halq, ss O-Lion, make Linkross ss 2 tokens, make Martial Mech, ss O-lion and O-Lion token, make Garden Rose Maiden add Black Garden, use Black Garden, make Crystal Wing, make Vermillion Dragon Mech (machine for Auroradon), use Black Garden ss Garden Rose. From this, you can ss and use Protos to pop Linkross and locking opponent from light attribute (but you need another extender to keep Protos on field, as we need it to make Barricadeborg). Then make Barricadeborg (now we have link 2 machine + Vermillion Dragon Mech), use Garden Rose gy eff ss Crystal Wing, make Auroradon ss 3 tokens, tribute Auroradon + 1 token and ss another O-Lion from deck, last step is we make synchro lv 8 Dragite (can use Borreload Savage or Tenyi if we dont declare dark with Protos).

Cons: Eldlich/Dragma only suffers a bit and can still play even if you lock them from light.  &nbsp;"

Activate cauldron of the old man to gain TONS of LP, and deal out plenty of damage as well.  Use child's play to gain more LP, while making your monsters untouchable when working with cauldron.  Use pyro monsters to work together creating a chain of damage.  Since raging flame sprite is a three star it can attack regardless of gravity bind, and attacks LP directly, doing more damage over time.  Summon lava golem to your opponents field, dealing 1000 damage every turn.  With this combo, you should be relatively untouchable, while dealing a good amount of damage each turn. Plus, with gravity bind, you can constantly gain LP, while being able to switch freely to damage!  Hope you like the deck :) leave advice in the comments.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

And a bit annoying to face. It uses a few resources and uses graveyard as a really good resource pack. With this deck, you can go either first or second. Going first gives you the chance of going full combo and making a really good end board on your 1st turn. Going second on the other side isn't that good but it can make amazing plays as well and may have OTK potential. The rokket monsters are the main way to summon extra deck cards. Galaxy spiral dragon is used to summon number 38 hope harbinger dragon titanic galaxy and save you from some attacks and 1of your opponent's spell cards each turn. Scarlight red dragon archfiend is used to destroy opponent's special summoned monsters(your's too if any) and then do a decent amount of damage by this effect. Borreload savage dragon can be summoned really easily and can have 1-4 negations. Side deck created to face any kind of deck. Chaos Dragon Levianeer is used to destroy up to 2 of opponent's cards.

It is an aggressive deck and best going first. First thing you want to do is get out zombie world. Which you have multiple ways to access.  This deck is very consistent and easy to play. Now I will list the purpose of each card in the deck.  <strong>Main Deck</strong>  <strong>Monsters</strong>  Doomking Balerdroch: 1 monster negate and banish per turn with zombie world out.  Jack-o-Bolan: Send a zombie monster from your hand to the graveyard. The best cards to send are Necroworld Banshee and Glow-Up Bloom if you have zombie world out. While this card is on the field during your opponents turn you can use it to summon a zombie monster from your graveyard.  Necroworld Banshee: This card is mainly to get zombie world out. You want this in the graveyard at all cost while you do not have zombie world out yet. Do not summon unless you have no other option. This is also the first card you want to send to the graveyard with any effect while you do not have zombie world out on the field.  Mezuki: This card is used as a way to make Union Carrier more usable. If you have a way to send  Shiranui Solitaire: Summon this to use its effect to summon Uni-Zombie.  Uni-Zombie: If you do not have zombie world out use this to send Necroworld Banshee from your 1 Your hand and 2 Your deck if Necroworld Banshee is not in your hand. And after you do that use its effect to send Glow-Up Bloom the the graveyard. This card can also be used to synchro summon.  Dragon Buster Destruction sword: Drawing into this card is like drawing into a garnet. It is not something you want to draw but it is ok if you do. Do not send it to the graveyard as it is the card you equip to Doomking Balerdroch with Union Carrier. Doing this locks your opponent out of the extra deck.  Glow-Up Bloom: Send this card to the graveyard while zombie world is on the field to special summon Doomking Balerdroch from your deck. Keep in mind. You can only do this once per turn. A very good way to use this is to summon it to the field with another zombie monster while you have zombie world on the field to go into Union Carrier and then use its effect allowing you to summon Doomking Balerdroch and lock out your opponent from their extra deck.  <strong>Spells</strong>  One for One: Use this card to send a monster from your hand to the graveyard while you have zombie world on the field to special summon Glow-Up Bloom. Then Link Summon Linkuriboh to activate Glow-Up Blooms effect. This card is also an easy way to get out Union Carrier as you summon Glow-Up Bloom with this card and have another zombie monster on your field you can link summon Union Carrier and activate Glow-Up Bloom you can then Special summon doomking Balerdroch and then equip Dragon Buster Destruction Sword to it to lock your opponent out of the extra deck.  Dragged Down into the grave: Make sure you have nothing in your hand you want to keep before playing this card. This is a good way to check your opponents hand for any troublesome cards and you can force your opponent to send one of the cards from your hand into the graveyard.  Harpie's Feather Duster: Use this card to clear you opponents back row. This is a good card in any deck.  Triple Tactics Talent: This card is very good. Once your opponent activates any monster effects on your turn you will be able do one of these things: Take Control of one of your opponents monsters for the rest of the turn, Draw two, Or discard one card in your opponents hand of your choice. I recommend drawing 2 tho.  One Day of Peace: Essentially a plus a card to raise efficiency of the deck.  Upstart goblin: Just use it. It makes the deck basically a 39 card deck.  Card Destruction: Allows you to use zombie graveyard effects and see what kind of deck your opponent is using for your virus card. Cards to set, summon, or activate before use are; Zombie world, Uni-Zombie, Eradicator Epidemic Virus, and Rivalry of Warlords.  Terraforming: Use to get zombie world.  Foolish Burial: Use to send Necroworld Banshee to the graveyard if you do not have zombie world out. And if you do have zombie world out use to send Glow-Up Bloom to the Graveyard.  Twin Twisters: Discard and destruction of opponents spells and traps.  Super Polymerization:Use this card to special summon using your opponents monsters while you have zombie world out. If you go first set this card and wait until your opponent has 2 monsters out. If you go second activate zombie world first then use this card.  Zombie world: makes all monsters zombie type.  <strong>Traps</strong>  Infinite Impermanence: Used to negate a monster effect.  Eradicator Epidemic Virus: Use this card to send Balerdroch to the graveyard during your opponents draw phase. If you do not know what type of deck your opponent is using always choose spells.  Rivalry of Warlords: Used with Zombie world to limit your opponent to basically 1 monster on the field.  <strong>Extra Deck.</strong>  Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon: This is the monster you summon with Super Polymerization.  Union Carrier: If you manage to get this card out only do it by using Glow-Up Bloom as a Material for it while Zombie world is on the field so that you can get out Doomking Balerdroch to the field to equip your Dragon Buster Destruction sword to.  The rest of the extra deck cards are not as important and you can choose to use them or not.  For the side deck you can change those cards if you want to."

Lock your opponent out the first turn, the second turn go into hot red abyss (and bane if you want), and any links. Flash and DNA could be taken out for more meta cards but this works very well for me even against top decks. DNA surgery is clutch when you have to use buster dragon to make hot red so you don't lose it at the end of the turn.  Main weaknesses: dark ruler no more, mystic mine, nibiru  Barring borrel savage, the whole deck is budget-friendly at about $100. That being said, Borreload Savage is necessary. Buster will lock out all monsters, and barrel load savage is needed to prevent any big s/t plays."

The basic combo of this deck is to end on Borreload Savage Dragon (3 negates), Herald of Arc Light, Draglubion, and Hope Harbinger which can be done through many different combinations however the most common would be Jet Synchron and two level 8's on the field. This board is very hard to play through with 3 negates (2 omni), prevents monsters from getting to the graveyard, directs attacks to hope harbinger, and possible protection for dragon's with return of the dragon lords. If you can get 2 more level 8's on field you get an extra negate with photon lord. There is usually enough resources on the next turn to go into dingirsu.  The advanced combo for this deck requires a white stone of legends or ancients, world legacy guardragon, and one level 8 on board, this will achieve an end board of Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres, Borreload Savage (3 negates), Herald of Arc Light, Hope Harbinger. This provides all the disrputions in the basic combo, plus a bounce and you heavenly sphere can search dragon spirit of white on board to banish a spell. On the next turn you can XYZ summon dingirsu by tributing dragon spirit of white and blue eyes you will have on board through white stone of ancients, to finish them off.  &nbsp;"

Yes, we run Alphan instead of ritual lineup cus it makes Verte and replaces itself wh","Based on Light Tsukiko deck in OCG Structure manga. It uses all the good stuff being Herald and Timelord. But instead of using ritual, we're using Super Quant because the card advantage it gives us. I'll explain the Alphan setup, if you summon Alphan (normal summon or from Diviner of the Heralds and One for One), use eff choose Alphan, Red Layer, and White Layer (they are the best Quants main deck, it guarantees us pluses). 2/3 chance Red Layer goes to gy for free ss and the other 1/3 chance if it is summoned, we use Red recover White (not Alphan, but the big one), ss White using Red as fodder triggering Red eff for free ss. Also pay attention to White Layer effect, as its <strong>second eff</strong> may look good but it really is not, like if we already triggered Red eff there's no need to use White 2nd eff, also it ensures us to trigger another Alphan we recovered later next turn. The <strong>third eff</strong> is super great, but we have to recover Alphan from gy only, because if White is summoned/milled through Alphan, it means we would have 2 Alphan outside of the deck, we need all 3 different Super Quant in deck to trigger our recently added Alphan from gy for follow up play.  The Diviner combo is easy, we dump Trias Hierarchia (or White/Red/Time Maiden depends on what we need if we already have Trias in hand), use Trias ss itself by tributing Diviner, trigger Diviner ss Valkyrie Sechste, use Sechste ss Sigrun, make TK of All Calamities using Trias + Sigrun while still having Sechster on the field, it means any extender can result to Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. The extenders we use are: Red Layer, Hecatrice + Valhalla, Tuner's High (searches Diviner by using lvl1 fairy fodder, works with Alphan, Time Maiden, and Sechste), Time Maiden (Tuner's High fodder, first eff to break board by adding Zaphion for backrow or Metaion for monster, second eff for follow up play doing the same as 1st eff), Foolish Burial (dump Red Layer if we have another Super Quant in gy or Trias/White Layer), and lastly One for One. The Super Quant field is there cus its just 1 material xyz for Red/White Layer as additional disruption.  <img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//a/a5/TsukikoKuroda.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Great first turn board while still having Dragoon as backup if interrupted, only uses minimal resource, big staple slot, follow up play is super great thanks to Alphan and Timelord lineup, Timelord is also good going second.  Cons: Bad matchup against backrow deck."

And Pot of Avarice!,"Salamangreat deck I'm working on. The goal is to set up as many interactions as you can in the early game, then eventually follow up with a 1 card Accesscode Talker, a 5k beatstick with 2 attacks thanks to Update Jammer, and 3 targeted destructions as well to break boards.  I'm running 6-8 normal summons. 3 Lady Debug and 3 Formud Skipper are both full combo with Accesscode Talker. Lady Debug is also the start to a pretty good Salamangreat board, since it searches Gazelle or any other extender you need. Formud Skipper only has one target, Parallel EXceed. This should help you start Salamangreat plays while also getting you easy access to Abyss Dweller. 2 Foxy are backup starters, okay normal summons in a pinch, but they're also relatively free extenders and lines of interaction. I decided to skip One For One, as I don't want Skipper bad enough to pitch a card for it.  3 Parallel EXceed make full combo with any other monster, which is the main draw to them, and give easy access to Abyss Dweller. Not much else to say, just a powerful Cyberse monster that is an engine requirement and a combo piece all in one.  We've got a lot of 1 ofs in the the deck, since I'm skipping Desires. Gazelle makes the deck tick, a total engine requirement that is at 1 for a reason. Micro Coder helps make Code Talker combos possible and can search Cynet Conflict or Cynet Mining. Seems good as a 1 of. Falco, Spinny, Mole, and Jaguar are all Salamangreat extenders with various upsides. Seems worth it to run a single Mole to make the combos easier.  For hand traps I have 3 Ash, 3 D.D. Crow, and 3 Called By The Grave. Ash is not amazing right now, but the deck can recurr it, and Ashing ever turn is actually still pretty good. D.D. Crow is essential against Adamancipators, and still super clutch against Eldlich. Called is likewise useful in both of those matchups, and also protects our search heavy deck from Ash and any spicy Droll out there.  3 Cynet Mining can find either combo (which use different cards) or any extender, and can also pitch cards you want in the GY there, as well as be searchs with Micro Coder. Salamangreat Circle is also limited for a reason, both effects are stellar, and having you pick of them is insane. Salamangreat Sanctuary is an engine requirement, basically a total brick if you draw it, so even though you need it I'm only running 1. Will of the Salamangreat is essentially a free extender in any situation, and a very good one. I'm only running 2 because I don't want to see 2 copies together as often. The last spicy, spicy choice is 3 Pot of Avarice. People told me not to do this, but in testing I'm liking it a lot. Basically all of the deck's combos put 5 or more extra deck monsters in the GY off of 1 or 2 cards, and the deck is full of free extenders that remain useful as your turn goes on. This also lets you recycle used Salamangreat Monsters to continue making plays after you would be out of gas. It's insane this card is at 3, and I think more decks should take advantage of that. The downside is it won't find you a starter in a hand full of bricks, but in testing this basically never comes up. The deck is full of 1 and 2 card combos.  For traps I have 2 Rage, 1 Roar, and 1 Cynet Conflict. Conflict could basically be Roar #2, I might be wrong to run this, it's just here so Microcoder can search it as part of the Accesscode combo. It does help in that circumstance. Good traps are good, getting multiple lines of good interaction I can search is helpful to surviving to OTK with Accesscode. Might switch to 2 Roar.  For the extra deck we have 3 Balynx, insane card, must run 3. It starts all of your combos by searching Sanctuary. 3 Sunlight Wolf. With Pot of Avarice you'll easily go through more than 3 of these in a game. This can recurr Ash, recurr your traps making Gazelle even better, recurr combo pieces or extenders. 2 each of Heatleo and Pyropheonix. This give ways to interact with your opponents and Salamangreat beatsticks, very good for doing what Salamangreats do best. I'd love more of these, but that's what Avarice is for. Update Jammer, Transcode, and Accesscode are for the Accesscode combo. 2 Transcode is for the Code Talker trap - you can often end on Pyro Phoenix and Transcode Talker with both counter-traps.  Against Eldlich, side 3 D.D. Crow, 3 Cosmic Cyclone, and 3 Called. Very similar to normal set up. Against Adamancipators side 3 Nibiru, 3 D.D. Crow, and either 3 Called by the Grave or 3 Dark Ruler No More, depending on whether you're going first or second. Against Altergeist side 3 Cyclone, 3 Lightning Storm, 3 Evenly. Against combo going second, side 3 Evenly, 3 Dark Ruler, and 3 of any relevant hand trap or Lightning Storm if you know they end with backrow/attack position monsters such as links. We're basically counting on a recurrable Ash being good enough against everything else (along the other lines of interaction like Roar, Circle, etc).  1 card Accesscode Talker combos  Lady Debug Combo <ol>  	<li>Summon Lady Debug, searching Gazelle.</li>  	<li>Link Lady Debug into Baleynx, searching Sanctuary.

You can just wait until you get Blue-eyes and Alternative, or use cards to get them, like Melody of awakening dragon, then get rid of your opponents monsters with Alternative's effect, and fuse to get Alternative Ultimate. It's a really good card. You can bring back dead dragons with Red-eyes darkness metal, and get them into the graveyard with Dragon's shrine, or you can get White stone in the graveyard, to special summon a blue-eyes monster. Or you can let your monsters get destroyed and then summon interplanetary purplythorny dragon to the field, and use instant fusion or poly to fuse some tuner from your hand/field to create Sea Monster of Theseus, then with those two syncrho summon Ascension Sky dragon, or use other tuners to summon other Synchros, like Brionac. There is a slightly more detailed description with links to the cards I'm talking about on the other deck. Either way you should look at it, because they have some differences in card types. Or don't. IDC. I hope you enjoy this deck :)  Feel free to comment on what to add, and/or make this deck or a edit with your cards or on Dueling Nexus.  &nbsp;"

With the right hand it can pass a few negates and still win.,"First time I upload a deck, be nice with me and hope you enjoy ;)  Totally blind second deck.  Basically you start with Faris, Stratos and other fodders to play the Xtra Link monsters to have materials for fusions, in order Cross Crusader using Malicious to add a Hero (possibly Adusted Gold, Hell Devicer for materials and Dread Decimator to boost). Make Sunrise, had Miracle Fusion, do another fusion in view of what you face, summon Malicious Bane with Dark Calling, break the weaklings, go for opponent's LP. Dark Law, Super Poly and Dark Ruler in case you need them.  The side is little cause I think the main deck is good as it is, and you can switch some fusion depending on the opponent. Not sure what else to add. Maybe something in case you have to go first.  Any suggestion is welcomed."

A simple combo can be done with Balancer Lord, Parallel Exceed, and Pikari @Ignister.  Normal summon the Balancer Lord, then use its effect to normal summon the Pikari @Ignister from your hand. Then use Pikari @Ignister to add A.I.Land to your hand. Link Balancer Lord and Pikari @Ignister into Cyberse Wicckid, and use Parallel Exceed to special summon itself because you summoned a link monster. Use Cyberse Wicckid to banish Balancer Lord and add Bururu @Ignister to your hand.  Activate Balancer Lord's effect to special summon the Bururu @Ignister from your hand. Then use Parallel Exceed's effect to special summon another copy of itself from the deck, but remember, both Parallel Exceeds are level 4 due to being summoned by Parallel Exceed's effect. Activate A.I.Land. Link Cyberse Wicckid, Bururu @Ignister, and 1 Parallel Exceed to make Dark Templar @Ignister. Then link the other Parallel Exceed into a Linguriboh. Use Dark Templar @Ignister's effect to special summon Pikari @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister from your graveyard to zones Dark Templar @Ignister point to. Synchro summon Wind Pegasus @Ignister using Pikari @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister. Bururu @Ignister will revive the other synchro material, so in this case, Pikari @Ignister. Pikari @Ignister will make Wind Pegasus @Ignister level 4. Xyz summon Light Dragon @Ignister using Wind Pegasus @Ignister and Pikari @Ignister. Now link Linguriboh and Dark Templar @Ignister to summon Accesscode Talker.  So now you have Light Dragon @Ignister to destroy your opponent's board and Accesscode Talker with 5300 attack points ready to destroy your opponent's cards by banishing different attribute monsters in your graveyard, which is a lot of different attributes. Not to mention you have 2 or 3 cards in your hand left, it just depends if you're going first or 2nd. Also thanks to @Rei on discord for teaching me this combo!  &nbsp;"

All you have to do in this deck is: go second, interrupt your opponents's play with handtrap, then in your turn, you try to activate key card ""<span>numeron network</span>"" and you its effect to activate ""<span>numeron calling</span>"" to summon 4 numbers from your extradeck and OTK by attacking on your opponents monster to trigger their effect to gain double atk up to 8000 atk, if you can't OTK them in that turn, you summon ""<span>number c1</span>"" to basnish all monster and try survive untill your next turn to burn your opponents's LP.  If you fail to OTK your opponent, you can use 3 xyz monsters to summon ""<span>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</span>"" to stand still until your next turn.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Back with another deck profile here, but this time I chose to remake my old Salad list, because it's kinda old, so here is a new deck with why the cards are included in the deck at all!</span>  <span>Monsters(23)</span>  <span>3x Parallel eXceed - This card is a new card that I think should be played more often, and it definitely will with all its cool effects! One of these effects are to special summon itself from the hand to a link arrow zone when a link monster is summoned to the field, and if you do, its level is 4 and its stats (ATK and DEF) are halved, it also has another effect to bring another copy of itself to the field from the deck. So, what I'm getting from this card is that you can instantly make any generic r4nk in the game with just one special summon and a link summon (of course link summon first). This card is great for just making our pal Number 41: Bagooska from the deck immediately, potentially becoming a complete overpower towards your opponent.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Jack Jaguar - Jack is part of the Salad monsters, really only here for its effect to shuffle one Salad monster from your grave to your deck to special itself to a zone a link monster points to. So, this card is just a neat way to get r4anks easily, or more links on the field. This could be a target for Gazelle, mostly being so.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Fowl - This bird is also here for its level (4) and its effect to special itself from the hand if another Salad is summoned on the field, being great for, again, being material for either a r4nk or a link summon. But it has another little effect, too. This lets it target a facedown on your opponent's board, and basically negate it, while it's set facedown on the field, all at the cost of the demise of a Salad from the hand, which is actually more of a benefit for the deck than a downside.</span>  <span>3x Lady Debug - Ah, Lady Debug, by far the best searcher of the deck, letting you add any level 3 or lower Cyberse monster from your deck to your hand. This card was </span><i><span>so good, </span></i><span>that it was limited for a time, and now its back to 3, which is convenient since we lost a little consistency when we had the card limited. This is your primary normal summon, being a search if its overall summoned. This is yet another level 4, being good material for r4ank, links, and really good for Baleynx.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Falco - This Salad is here for its effect, if sent to the graveyard, to set one Salad spell/trap from the gy, which is good for getting that essential rage back to the field, or that roar that will come in handy later game. This card is a good level 4, and therefore is r4ank and link material.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Gazelle - This card is also very good, being limited currently, having the effect to Foolish Burial and Salad from the deck (besides itself) if it was summoned, and then could be special summoned if another Salad went to the gy, besides itself. This card can start so many plays just by being on the field and having its effect go through.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Spinny - Spinny is only here to discard and special itself from the gy. Spinny just adds towards our goal to link summon, aiding as a link material for pretty much everything.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Foxy - Any Salad deck would be a joke if we didn't have a decent normal summon out of Foxy, being a good face up spell/trap destroyer from gy, or excavating cards until he finds a Salad card, adding that to hand, and shuffling everything else back. He adds to the link summoning cause, and yeah, he's the second most important normal summon.</span>  <span>3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - This card.... is just too good! being able to negate just about ANYTHING a meta deck throws in your way, and only being negated by a select few cards, some of them never showing up in people's decks. Ash is probably THE best hand trap of the game, besides Nibiru.</span>  <span>1x Micro Talker - Micro Talker is here for many reasons, one of them being it can be used as link material from the hand, which is nuts, and it's other effect that if it was sent to the gy as link material from the hand/field, you can add any one Cynet spell/trap from your deck to the hand, and if it was used as link material on the field, the search was instead a level 4 cyberse instead. As I said, this card is </span><i><span>crazy.</span></i>  <span>3x D.D. Crow - This is a very affordable hand trap, being good, too, banishing a card from your opponent's gy is nothing to laugh at.</span>  <span>2x Formud Skipper - Formud is actually a decent card in Salad, being able to mimick one of your link monsters and make reincarnation link summoning WAY easier.</span>  <span>Spells (10)</span>  <span>2x Will of the Salamangreat - This is probably the best spell card for this deck, either to special summon a Salad monster from the hand, once per turn. But, in my opinion, the better option was to special summon Salad monsters, up to the number of a reincarnated link summoned Salad monster on the field, which can be from 1-3, being Salamangreat Baleynx, Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf, and Salamangreat Heatleo. </span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Sanctuary - This is the field spell of the deck, giving you the ability to reincarnation link summon any Salad link monster. We only play one to avoid any consistency issues with the deck, having extra copies can damage the hand and hinder the deck’s consistency. We also only run one because it can be easy to search out by the combo starter of the deck, Salamangreat Balenyx.</span>  <span>3x Cynet Mining - Cynet Mining is the best searcher, for our searcher, Lady Debug, or our little friend Salamangreat Gazelle, or heck, add Micro Coder for its useful effect!</span>  <span>1x One for One - This card is only here to either add Formud Skipper or Micro Coder from our deck to the hand, could be a easy bait for that Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring your opponent may have.</span>  <span>2x Pot of Desires - This pot is basically the generic draw support of the meta. Sure, banishing 10 cards facedown is kinda bad, but you get two cards off of it, and it's why we play more than one copy of certain cards. Also, before you use this card, finish the necessary combos before using this card.</span>  <span>1x Salamangreat Circle - This card is, again, a searcher for either Gazelle or Foxy, being able to get you cards you need, of the Salad archetype, from your deck to the players hand.</span>  <span>Traps (9)</span>  <span>1x Cynet Conflict - This card is a negation card for the CodeTalker archetype, and were running it because we have two different CodeTalkers in the deck, Accesscode Talker, and Transcode Talker.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Roar - This negate is for our dominate archetype of the deck, Salamangreat, therefore you're probably gonna use this one more often, as it can come back from the gy after use if there was a reincarnation linked monster on the field, but it gets banished when it leaves the field. So, with this effect, it can be reused.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Rage - This card is the deck’s main removal, being able to effectively destroy up to 3 cards on the field, being great for Sky Striker matchups since that’s the usual amount of cards they have on the field.</span>  <span>1x Gravedigger's Trap Hole - This card...., how do I explain this amazing new card? It's effect by itself is powerful, letting you negate a effect from your opponent's hand, grave, or a monster's effect from banished, THEN you can inflict 2000 damage after already negate an effect. This card is the only card you can set with our Traptrix Raffleisa's effect, which sends it to the gy and then gains it's effect. This trap matches up well with Thunder Dragon, negating the majority of it's effects AND making them fear that possible face down, but then there is Dinos, which are also a problem right now, but most importantly, mirror matches are going to be a breeze, unless it's this exact deck, then I would watch out if I was you.</span>  <span> </span>  <span>Extra Deck (15)</span>  <span>1x Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir - This card is probably the best r4ank in the game, if it's not Abyss Dweller, who'll we'll get into later. In it's effect, you have to detach a material from it each standby phase, if not, destroy it. But, it's neither targeted nor destroyed by card effects if in attack position. The real reason why it's here is for it's other effect, which can initiate some OTK's this deck may have, and that is to make every monster on the field (face up) to defense (also face up), and negates any effect that may activate in response, as long as it's a monster effect. This card is a must have in every deck that can make r4anks, or at least a recommendation.</span>  <span>1x Number 60: Dugares the Timeless - This card is another great r4ank that can be pretty game changing, with an effect that can skip your next draw phase, and then let you draw two cards and discard one card, excellent fuel for Gazelle's effect if you discard a Salad monster. Another effect it has is to skip your next main phase, and then special summon a monster from the gy in face-up defense position. Then the last effect is to skip your next battle phase, then double one monster's attack points (your field) for the rest of that turn. You can only activate one of these effects, and you gotta detach two materials to activate any of the effects listed above you.</span>  <span>1x Traptrix Rafflesia - This card is mainly here for the same reason as Gravedigger's Trap Hole, mainly for it to detach a material from itself and then send a ""Trap Hole"" trap card from the deck to the gy, then it's effect becomes that. So in this case, a really good effect that will benefit this deck a lot when it's in a pickle, also Nibiru gets negated from this (Gravedigger's Trap Hole's effect on it, of course).</span>  <span>1x Accesscode Talker - This card should be played for many reasons, one of those reason's are that it can gain attack off of a link monster used for it's link summon, 1 rating being 1000 ATK. Another reason would be it's removal effect, which is pretty straightfoward, banish a link monster, pop a card (monster) with the same Attribute, but you can't banish monster's with the same Attribute as the monster you used to activate Accesscode Talker's effect. Oh, one more thing about it's other effect, it can't be responded to, negated, nothing, absolutely nada. The second effect also doesn't target, making it insanely powerful in that single fact. It is also not a once per turn. With that, this card can possibly be banned in the upcoming banlists.</span>  <span>2x Salamangreat Heatleo - This card isn't used an awful lot in this deck, mainly used for it's cool back row removal effect, or that useful attack boosting effect, but other than that, it's just not used as much as the next Salamangreat card on this list.</span>  <span>1x Transcode Talker - The infamous Transcode Talker and Update Jammer combo. I'll tell you how to do it in the bottom.</span>  <span>1x Update Jammer - Same reason as Transcode, simply for it's neat effect and it's role in it;s combo, which will be shown below.</span>  <span>3x Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf - This card is the main link summon (besides Balyenx) that you must accomplish on turn one. This isn't optional as you need to make this before comboing off, unless you decide to take the turn two approach and combo into the old Transcode and Update OTK.</span>  3x Salamangreat Baleynx - Baleynx is the starter of the deck, being the first monster from the extra deck every game, or at least that's the priority for this deck as it protects Salamangreat cards once from destruction.  1x Splash Mage - This card can act as a monster reborn for your Cyberse monsters, but it negates it's effects, also it locks you out of special summoning any other monsters for the turn, besides Cyberse, which, if you think about it, isn't that horrible, since all of the monsters in the deck are Cyberse. Another reason why this card is here is for fuel for Accesscode Talker's effect, since you can't banish the same Attribute of the link monster used to activate it's effect.  &nbsp;  Side Deck (15)  The cards currently placed in the Side Deck are simply for filler, you can do whatever you want with this part of the deck.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Combo:  NS=Normal Summon  SS=Special Summon  &nbsp;  Update+Transcode  NS Lady Debug  Activate it's effect to add Salamangreat Gazelle  SS using Lady Debug into Salamangreat Baleynx  Use Balenyx's effect to add Salamangreat Sancturary  Activate Sancturary to then reincarnation link summon another Baleynx  Activate Gazelle from hand to SS itself when the other Baleynx is sent for Reincarnation Link Summon Baleynx.  Activate Gazelle's effect to send Salamangreat Jack Jaguar from the deck to the gy  Activate Jack to send Baleynx back to the ED from the gy, then special it to the zone Baleynx points to  Link off Gazelle and Baleynx into Update Jammer  Link off Update Jammer and Jack Jaguar into Transcode Talker  Activate Transcode to SS Update onto a zone it points to  Enjoy!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thank you for all of the viewers that decided to take the time and Really look at this deck. This took me a few days to make, with research and testing being a factor, and I hope to make more decks like this. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to comment below."

Welcome to the Brotherhoo","Hey Everyone, Rhysbans (Reese-bans) is here again with another installment of Karakuri in the Halqifibrax era. Before you chalk this up to a ""oh, this is just another Needlefiber + Tier Z deck that can get the surprise win every so often"" you'd be misunderstanding this deck. The deck is both an offensive and defensive deck that can beat Eldlich Auroradon, break Adamancipator's boards, beat Invoked, and dance around the new Trish Ritual decks coming out in the meta. On top of that, I am using Card of Fate - a card you'll either need to google or scoff at.  Before you leave, there are multiple reasons why I am running Card of Fate in a Karakuri Auroradon build. First, never has it mattered less what is in your opponents hand during your turn. Sure they can draw into hand traps, but the fact that you are pushing more resources into your own hand to extend plays is worth the effort.  And in many ways, my only real goal for turn one is to get a Jet Synchron in my hand at all costs; and, let's be honest, your opponent is going to have a way to get their cards in this era of Yugioh. A simple -1 for an extension can get you the combo pieces you need for a VFD, Naturia Beast, Prohibition, or Karakuri Shogan lvl 9. On top of that, if you have any sense of the duel your playing/current meta trends on EdoPro then Prohibition is a staple this format. Nibiru, Ash, Halqifibrax, Eldlich the Golden Lord, and then use Google for anything else you want to Prohibit.  If at this point you are still reading and now think, ""Wow this a tier Z deck with trash tech, this guy is full of crap."" Let me explain the combos in the deck.  Jet -&gt; Linkuriboh -&gt; Halq + 001 -&gt; Auroradon trib self and one token for O-Lion -&gt; Get lvl 8 Karakuri it searches for lvl 1 -&gt; Synch off for lvl 9 Karakuri -&gt; Lvl 9 searches for lvl 5 Karakuri -&gt; 001 + Lvl 5 + Token (lvl 3) == Ravenous Croco == 2 draws -&gt; 2 lvl 9s == VFD  &nbsp;  But Rhysbans, that combo can be broken. We have Prohibtion and Called by the Grave for protection. Don't feel comfortable with Prohibition? Trade in my Called by the Grave. You are running 3 tunings, 2 Jets, and 2 Card of Fate to get that Tuning/Jet in your hand at all costs.  Combo two: Have a Lvl 2 Karakuri in hand  Jet -&gt; Linkuriboh -&gt; Halq + 001 -&gt; Auroradon trib self and one token for O-Lion -&gt; Get lvl 8 Karakuri it searches for lvl 1 -&gt; Synch off for lvl 9 -&gt; Search Lvl 3 Karakuri -&gt; Extra NS from Lvl 3 to Lvl 2 -&gt; Lvl 2 searches for their Premature Burial Card or their Counter Trap or their Negate Effect Trap (you have options)-&gt; Naturial beast with 2+3 -&gt; If you took premature burial ss the lvl 8 and either do the lvl 1 effect for a draw or link off with 001 to get another lvl 9 (your call on what) and then you can have VFD and Naturia Beast. GG  Using the Gizmek lvl 9, and have played with two in this deck before shrugging into the Card of Fate. Gizmek Lvl 9 in this deck is butter.  Last Notes: You will get disrupted, you will have recovery plays. You aren't running bricks in this. Dark Hole isn't tech, it's stupid not to run Dark Ruler No More and non targeting spells in this era.  Poster Child: Karakuri 177. This card is a one star hero- searcher for a premature burial, or counter trap that is anti s/t, a way to get into a lvl 9 banisher and lvl 8 drawer, or their Infinite Impermance. ""But tHiS iS ToO SiTuAtIoNal."" No it's a f-ing chameleon if you don't over do deck building considerations."

It has been shown to take out full power Orcust with Maxx C. Please enjoy and have fun with,"This deck has a lot of moving parts, But ill going to get into the nitty and gritty, so be prepared. The Invoked and Shaddoll part of the deck is to primarily help to go first, with Winda and Mechaba. Dragma are your main damage dealers and Extra Deck destroyers. Since they destroy your OWN deck, N'tss and Shadoll Fusions are a no-brainer. There are some weird choices in this, so hang tight. The main boss monster(s) of the deck are Construct, Cardinal of Dogma Tetradragmatton, and Fleur-De-Lis, the Knight of Dragma, just to get that out of the way.  The Dragma part is the main part of the Deck. It gets rid of both yours and your opponents Extra Deck. Seems Great for a Go first deck, but as you will see, they're better at going second. Be forewarned, as both of their searchers (Ecclesia and Disciple from Nadir) lock you out of Extra Deck, so make sure to keep that in mind. Your smaller monster for the deck is Ecclesia, the searcher, and Adin, the summoner. Both of them share an effect stem, ""Cannot be destroyed by battle with a monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck. You can only use each of the following effects of (this monsters name) once per turn. <ol>  	<li> If a monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck is on the field: You can Special Summon this card from your hand.</li>  	<li>(insert individual effects here.)""</li> </ol> Ecclesia has 1500 Atk and Def. She can add any Dragma card to the hand, at the cost of locking you out of your Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. This can help Swarming the field with her and Adin, and they're both Level 4, so If you open with both of them in your hand, you can make a Rank 4, like <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>. Adin has 1000 and Def, and can Special Summon a Dragma from the deck when he's destroyed. This can also obviously help, as it can get their larger monsters out, like Maximus and Fleur-De-Lis. Now, let's get to their larger monsters.  First, is Maximus Dragma. He has 1500 Atk and a PHAT 3000 Def. It can special summon itself by banishing a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monster in your GY. We haven't seen it yet, but they do have some options to dump these. though you Can summon this with Adin, so that's a plus. It's other effect has both players dump 2 cards WITH DIFFERENT NAMES from Extra Deck. This also locks you out of the Extra Deck, and your opponent gets to chose, that's not an issue. you get to dump an N'tss AND an Apkallone. Though a combo I'll get into in the Shaddoll part, this can allow you to banish the cards your opponent just dumped.  Then, there's Cardinal of Dogma Tetradragmatton. it's a 3200 Atk and Def behemoth that must be special summoned by banishing 4 Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/OR Link monsters, with no other ways to summon it, not even from the GY. and when it attacks one of your opponents Special summoned monsters, it destroys all of their Attack Position Monsters then burns for 800 for each Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monsters. While this has no protection whatsoever, that's a good tradeoff for being able to get rid of ALL YOUR OPPONENTS ATTACK POSITION MONSTERS. The burn on this is just icing on the cake.  Finally, there's Fleur-De-Lis, the Knight of Dragma. He can special summon itself from the hand if a monster Special Summoned from the Extra Deck is on either player's field. The wording on this is important.  the others effects can be negated, while this cannot, unless they use a Solem or something. The other effect on this guy is that when any Dragma declares an attack, you can have all of them permanently gain 500 Atk (both of these are hard OPTs). This helps to Beat those Virgin Adamacipators into shape. getting Tetradragmatton to 3700 Atk is super deadly.  &lt;!--more--&gt;  Now, it's Finally Time for the Spell/Traps. There's a Normal spell, Field Spell, and 2 Traps. you waited 6 paragraphs for this, so let's just jump into it. Disciple from Nadir is a Normal Spell that reads, ""Send 1 monster from your Extra Deck to the GY, then add 1 ""Dragma"" monster or 1 [NAME REDACTED] from your Deck or GY to your hand with ATK less than or equal to the sent monster's. For the rest of this turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck. You can only activate 1 ""Disciple of the Nadir"" per turn."" This helps to get your combo pieces for obvious reasons, but there are no monsters in the Extra deck that surpass 3200 Atk, so <a data-name=""Tetradragmatton"">Tetradragmatton</a> can't be searched.  Now, the field spell,  <a data-name=""Dogmatic Nation Dragma"">Dogmatic Nation Dragma</a>. it reads, ""Neither player can target ""Dragma"" monsters you control with the effects of monsters that were Special Summoned from the Extra Deck. You can only use the following effects of ""Dogmatic Nation Dragma"" once per turn. <ol>  	<li>After damage calculation, if your ""Dragma"" monster battled an opponent's monster: You can destroy that opponent's monster.</li>  	<li>If this face-up card in the Field Zone is destroyed by an opponent's card effect: You can make each player send 1 monster from their Extra Deck to the GY.""</li> </ol> This is the protection that the Dragma need, but it isn't necessary. They can get rid of the threats before they threaten them. but you can crash your Dragma into a monster, and destroy it.  Next, the traps. Let's start off with Dragma Encounter. It allows you to special summon a Dragma from your hand. But it can also add a Dragma from your GY to your hand OR special summon it. that or effect is for Tetradragmatton, as it can't be special summoned from the Grave. How does it help? Hmm, it recovers during opponents turn so that's a plus. But it's a trap, so...  Finally, we get to Dragma Punishment. It says, ""Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; send 1 monster from your Extra Deck to the GY with an equal or higher ATK, and if you do, destroy the targeted monster. Until the end of your next turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck. You can only activate 1 ""Dragma Punishment"" per turn."" Do I need to say why you need to run it? Anything under or equal 2500 is getting destroyed AND another pop thanks to N'tss having 2500.  &lt;!--more--&gt;Next is the Invoked part of the deck. Like I said before, this is to help the deck with its main weakness, going second (Like Mekk-Knights.) Just running 2 of Aleister, <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, and <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> is enough, but I recommend adding <a data-name=""The Book of Law"">The Book of Law</a> to the mix for 2 reasons. <ol>  	<li>It can cycle through Invoked on a Quick-Play. When Mechaba is done with his effect, put out a Raidjin.</li>  	<li>It works on BOTH PLAYERS INVOKED MONSTERS.  With invoked being so rampant, having this can turn your opponents Mechaba to your own Prgatrio.</li> </ol> Now onto the Shaddolls. Beast for a draw, Dragon for dem Eldliches, Winda to set your Dragon, then there's Ariel. Remember when I said you could banish the cards you sent with Maximus? This is how. send Ariel by the effect of Apkalone, then banish 3 cards from their GY. This can hurt Eldlich, OR thanks to punishment, you can get rid of a Hal combo by banishing their Jet and Hal. Pretty good, huh?  &lt;!--more--&gt;  Now, why don't I have a Side Deck? Because I don't know what to put in there. Please tell me what to put in there to make this deck even better! Thanks for reading this essay. I'll try to make something like this every day. Hopefully Next day, Mathmech, my favourite archetype!  &nbsp;"

The deck is better going second because of the Monarch engine but has good options going first with cards like Re-qliate, Soul Transition, and Monarch Stormforth.  Cards like Skill drain, Rescue Hamster and Cyber Dragon Nova/Infinity are an option of course, however this list is supposed to be pure Qli´s and personally i don´t like them in the deck.  If played correctly you can get a lot of advantage, that said the deck is not easy to play if your not familiar with Qli´s.  As always don't copy a deck 1 to 1, add your flavor to it.  I love Qliphorts a lot and i´m working on them all the time to make them as good as possible."

If you draw into Jet Synchron/tuning/one for one, you can create a true king of all calamities. This is how the combo works.  1 normal summon Jet Synchron  2 link summon Linkuriboh with Jet Synchron  3 activate Jet synchron's affect and discard a card( for this combo it will be Adamancipator Analyzer) to SS itself (if you drew into Deskbot 001 discard it with jet Synchrons affect)  4 link summon Crystron Halqifibrax with Jet Synchron and Linkuriboh  5 activate crystron halqifibrax affect and SS deskbot 001  6 link summon Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon with deskbot 001 and crystron halqifibrax  7 activate Auroradon's affect and SS 3 tokens  8 trigger Deskbot 001's affect to SS itself  9 activate Auroradon's affect and destroy Auroradon and 1 token to SS Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion  10 synchro summon Garden Rose Maiden with O-Lion and 1 L3 token  11 activate O-Lion's affect and SS a token  12 synchro summon coral dragon with Deskbot 001 and Garden Rose Maiden  13 Synchro summon Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys with coral dragon and 1 L3 token  14 activate coral dragon and draw a card  15 activate Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys and draw a card  16 activate Garden Rose Maiden's affect and SS Coral Dragon  17 Synchro summon Vermillion Dragon Mech with coral dragon and last L3 token.  18 XYZ summon True King of all calamities with Vermillion Dragon Mech and Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys  This is the basic jet synchron combo but I am going to continue with what you can do with Adamancipator after this combo is performed.  19 activate Adamancipator signs and SS Analyzer.

In order to being able to do so, I put some cards that supports the strategy. First of all, Legacy of the duelist to limit your opponent setting card (which Is the only thing he can do, after the Zexal's effect succeded). Then Lightning storm, to have your opponent's field cleared when you go second, or when it has some dangerous board. A personal choice, is the Overlay Regen to improve Zexal's attack and consequently that chance to keep it on the field. Another important card of this deck to prevent Zexal to be targeted when activate its effect, is Sauravis which is good against cards like Infinite Impermanence or Sky striker- Widow Anchor. I also put mystic mine to overstop your opponent in some cases For the side deck feel free to substitute some cards with Mind drain, or some drain cards except Skill drain. Prohibition is an evergreen side deck cards that many Players undervalues, but in this deck is good. Another good card could be ""Lose 1 turn"" because of the timing of zexal and another one could be the new lv 10 Gizmek monster, up to enter in tcg. You have a 9 on 10 chance to put zexal on the first turn with this deck. Enjoy!"

The ratio still need work, and honestly the weakness is obvious once you play it, but it still runs pretty well in this format.  A few highlights  Card Destruction + Cat + Ayers gives you a free summon on cat and leaves a normal summon and +2 draw -2 cards, good for bad hands or even a good hand with a rag in grave and +2 can give you a higher chance faultroll and maybe lucky*2 faultroll  Tensu/Tenkai Combo is amazing for this deck. Rag in hand and Boggart + 1 monsters (Cat/Monk) give you normal + Boggart Normal so you hit +2 Monster, +2 Cat, Needle -1 leaving you Boggart, Nat Beast,  Boggart + Needle = link 3 going to Apollousa allowing for Magic negate and Monster effect negate.

Down below will be the old information for those that want it.  The only real update to the deck is the fact that we now have Called by at 1 and so I filled choose to fill in more from what the extra deck already had. However, an option to compensate for Called by that have been brought to my attention is Debunk. It is a trap card so you'll have to play that wisely. A tech option is adding in Zeus replacing Avramax as in my play runs of the deck he is very often not touched. Now just with the replacement of Zeus doesn't mean you'll be cleaning house, but he can help.   The OG stuffs The idea of the deck is to run in one of 3 routes.  1) Run the normal Crusadia line to Equimax or Avramax and punch out your opponents life points.  2) Spam out your Super Quant extra deck monsters to get your King with 4+ material and then beat at your opponent with him.  3) My favorite yet a challenge, is to end with Equimax and Super Quant King on field with 4+ material. Equimax should point at your King so he gains the ATK boost and since your King has 4+ material he can still attack. Effectively attempting to overwhelm the field with power.  Level 3 and 4 Crusadia monsters make for easy spamming out to the Super Quant Mech Beasts even if you don't use Super Quant monsters to make the beasts. Only down side would be the inability for that monsters quick effect if it doesn't have the corresponding layer.  The side deck functions more in favor for the Super Quant engine then anything else and is only what I use.

The Main Combo: 1. Summon Controller(Via Dai or Normal Summon) 2. Summon Tenyi 1 3. Link Into Monk 4. Summon Tenyi 2(If Ashuna was Tenyi 1, Make sure to use Ashuna GY ability after This summon) 5. Summon Shaman 6. Discard Card to summon Mare Mare(Get it to GY with Vessel, Foolish or Discard from Shaman) 7. Summon All 3 Tokens 8. Link Tokens and Mare into Sahasrara. End Board: Shaman, Controller, Sahasrara. If you expect a negate to appear on the board soon, make sure to get the Sahas tokens out sooner rather than later.  Extra Deck: You shouldnt really be looking to summon Baxia, Yazi, or Triforce if you need to activate Shaman's Summoning effect. Triforce is meant to be very late game, because summoning it off of a sahas token gets you the ability to resummon Baxia and Ashuna. Yazi, Baxia, and Ogre are you more common 2nd Turn Plays.  If I find that the controller is not a big enough Monster to protect itself, Sub it and Triforce out with Warwolf and Naturia Beast. And if you're going second, most likely will sub out Called for Dark Ruler(If playing against Big Board Decks).  Definitely want feedback so post down below with thoughts and possible tweaks."

Main combo if Going 1st: Servant Effect summon(However you can with the spells in hand) Use Servant Effect to bring out either Master or jackal(Depends on which you prefer. Best bet is Master) Summon Controller(Most likely from Dai before Servant Effect) Synchro Triarm and use effect to force a discard on the opponent.  If Going 2nd, Switch out Triarm with Horus in the combo and take control of an opponent's Monster.  Engine 2: Summoner Monk Effect to bring out blastfan Blastfan adds Oracle which summons itself Link into I:P Link into Selene Resummon Blastfan off Selene to get another search(Repeat each time when necessary)  Side Deck: Sub in Halqi Linkross combo using Overseer rather than O-Lion to be able to Turbo into selene with synchro fodder on the board."

Nibiru as one of the main interruption in this format can be avoided easily because even the main combos do not use that much summons.

If you see in game one that your opponents is playing a combo heavy deck but tries to avoid Nibiru or sets up early negates in his combo then swap Nibiru for Gizmek Uka and according barrier statue.  Your main 2 card combo is <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a> and <a data-name=""Maximus Dragma"">Maximus Dragma</a> both are searchable in this deck so the combo is consistent enough to pull it off regularly. You NS Aleister, search Invocation -&gt; Link Almiraj -&gt; Link Gardna -&gt; Invocation for Mechaba -&gt; SS Maximus (remove Almiraj) -&gt; Maximus effect, drop Apkallone and either Ashen Dragon or something situational like N`tss to pop a card or Sabre Dancer to prepare for OTK -&gt; use Apkallone to search Shaddoll Ruq, set Ruq -&gt; Do all the other Stuff you want -&gt; During End Phase you can search Fleur-De-Lis (additional interruption) if you dropped Ashen Dragon with Maximus -&gt; Opponents turn, Main Phase, use Ruq to fusion Winda. Try to chain this to an effect that SS something so that they immediately used their one SS after winda hits the field -&gt; Use Fleur-De-Lis effect -&gt; SS Fleur-De-Lis and negate the monster they just put on the field.

For the <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> / <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> combos i recommend to watch one of the million tutorial guides on YouTube. They are easy once you have done them yourself but a written guide only for this combo would probably be too much for this little text box here."

Because the <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> core is so small you can go for the real fancy <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> plays in this deck and transform a single <a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a> to a <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>. After resolving your first turn combo you are often left with only a few cards left in your extra. If your opponent is able to break your board that can be big downside because you are left with only a few main deck combo options but playing one big combo for 5 minutes straight feels kinda nice not gonna lie. *Little heads up for all the player how are running Eldlich for the first time. Be sure that you dont have <a data-name=""Cursed Eldland"">Cursed Eldland</a> on your Field or a way to remove it if you are trying to OTK.

On a good hand(Crystal Beacon + Crystal Bond) you can easily go +7-9, and you can even recover from much less good hands and go +6-7 if you get good luck with the Adamancipators. This deck is obviously far from viable, and would need major improvements to be considered even slightly so. Firstly, it doesn't really have a way to get past handtraps, and even though it can get a lot of advantage, almost every card in the deck NEEDS to be there, so finding room for handtraps while still staying consistent will take a better duelist than I. Secondly, there is a bit of luck involved, especially with the Adamancipators. It's not <em>too </em>important on a good hand, but if you open with just Pegasus, you better pray for some good luck. Thirdly, I don't really know how to make a good side deck, so you'll have to do that yourself. Also, this card is technically TCG legal, but Zenith isn't out in the TCG. All you need to make it OCG legal it to take out the second Saryuja, I recommend replacing it with Link Spider.  On a side note, do NOT do what I did in the first clip and use Raptite's effect to summon a monster and then summon Saryuja. Instead, use your Zenith's ability and special summon a CB from the deck while adding a Rainbow Dragon to your hand. This allows you to thin two more cards from your deck before you summon saryuja, not to mention you'll be shuffling some bricks in your hand to the bottom of the deck, making it easier for Raptite to pull a monster from the top 5 cards of your deck."

The deck just isn't the same without 3 or even 2 Toadally Awesome, but I decided to make do with what I had.  &nbsp;  The reason why I named this deck ""Toadally Screwed"" isn't to lament my favorite control deck getting nerfed. It's because it runs an engine of 3 Fury of Kairyu-Shin and 3 Torrential Tribute. Fury of Kairyu-Shin works moderately well in this deck. After searching Torrential Tribute with it, and then summoning a Frog with Toadally Awesome or summoning a Paleo trap, you can protect your monsters with Fury's graveyard effect.  &nbsp;  Hopefully, Konami will pull their heads out of their *ss and just limit Bahamut Shark instead, since it contributed to Toadally Awesome getting Limited."
