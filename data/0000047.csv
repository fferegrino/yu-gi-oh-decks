If you play first you can relieve on the raidraptor link to play the xyz 4 strix, tuto a rank-up and make a board with Armor Master and Cyber Dragon Infinity. The xyz 6 raidraptor is an alternative if you triggered effects that prevent you to summon non-winged beasts monsters, as it can destroy a monster and burn the opponent to facilitate the OTK.  The ideal starter is Simoon The Poison Wing + Steam The Cloak. Simoon banish Steam and tuto Black Whirlwind to search Auster the South Wind. Normal summon Auster to special summon Steam and tuto another Blackwing monster, now with litteraly one card you can spam the board.  Zephyros The Elite is an important card since you can search it during the raidraptor loop to bounce back a Black Whirlwind and have one more special summon.  Auster is important too but 1 is sufficient, it's relatively easy to tuto and more could be bricky."

One of my closest friends, Jeremy Mitchell AKA The Pendulum God, has done it again this year, finishing 35th Place at the North American World Championship Qualifiers after day 2. I'm so proud of him, he worked hard and it all paid off. In this format it is so hard to top with pendulum magicians especially at the NAWCQ where all of the best players gather, but he did it because he's so good with the deck. I want everyone to support him and be there for him, just like how he has been there for us, showing us how to play the deck and showing us his amazing deck profiles. If you guys want more explanation about Jeremy Mitchell and his background with Pendulum Magicians, go check out my other posts with his deck profiles! Below I am providing a link with his deck profile on youtube, that provides explanations for his card choices and what he would have changed in the deck. Also, I want you all to support him by subscribing to his Patreon!

Here you can find bunch of techs / engines / dragon cards which migh,"Hi I am Poske Yugituber. I thoroughly isolated dragons with zero potentional from the good Dragons. This is a great place to come by if you are searching for Dragon techs / engines / decks. <strong>Each Dragon / Dragon related Card</strong> has its usability  explained below but first here are some diff decks in which I exploited Dragons.  Some decks which can use Guardragons / Dragon toolbox for powerful combos: <ul>  	<li>Dragunity (Leyvaten and Barcha became good) - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2E3CzKyC_k</a></li>  	<li>Pendulum magician variants - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOzjmxi0eac&amp;t=</a></li>  	<li>Crusadia - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUJ5Q57Byms</a></li>  	<li>Rokkets with Striker Dragon - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbauQlvSm0w</a></li>  	<li>Thunder - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELtj-c_iysI</a></li>  	<li>Rose Dragons <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGK_WQ4EHjo&amp;t=35s</a> (No guardragon, fresh)</li>  	<li>Buster blader, Cyber Darks, Heraldics, Hieratics, Red-Eyes, Blue-Eyes, World chalice.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Guardragon database download links: (2 because 1 wasn't enough) but I <strong>recommend reading</strong> each dragon card below if you are in a hunt for good dragons.  <a>https://www.sendspace.com/file/ge6xgp</a>  <a>https://www.sendspace.com/file/plj4pw</a>  <strong>NEW <a data-name=""Garden Rose Maiden"">Garden Rose Maiden</a> - not a dragon but can revive Dragon synchros</strong>  <strong>NEW!</strong> <a data-name=""Nebula the Star Cloud Dragon"">Nebula the Star Cloud Dragon</a> - summons itself and a lvl 8 dragon from hand , adds back lvl 4 dragons from grave.  <strong>New</strong>! <a data-name=""Spiral Dragon Bulge"">Spiral Dragon Bulge</a> - You can special summon him from hand/grave if you control 2 or more Light and or Dark dragons. He is level 8 and can make all monsters become lvl 8. R8 plays for days. <h1 class=""entry-title""></h1> <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon</a> - in scale he revives a Dragon Fusion / Synchro / Xyz He also searches Pendulum dragons, Darkwurm being the most relevant one  <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a> - doesn't really need an introduction, revives dragons commonly summoned off guardragons. The most popular dragon. not HOPT.  <a data-name=""Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End"">Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End</a> - Got an errata, searchable by Melody of awakening Dragon just like his new brother below, He is more of a backup plan  <a data-name=""Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon"">Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon</a> - his pendulum effect allows you to fetch banished dragons by destroying itself, Eclipse Wyvern is often re-used with him He also has massive removal effect (Send based) but you gotta sacrifice the field on your own except for the Extra monster zone.  <a data-name=""Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand"">Divine Dragon Lord Felgrand</a> - Versitaile Removal if revived from graveyard, Can revive a lvl 7/8 Dragon-Type monster if he destroys a monster by battle  <a data-name=""Light and Darkness Dragon"">Light and Darkness Dragon</a> - He is one of the best tribute summons in the game. Once per chain when an effect is activated he can negate it by reducing his attack by 500 Given that he isn't once per turn and has 2800 atk. Thats a lot of negates if you can protect him from getting ran over.  <a data-name=""Amorphage Goliath"">Amorphage Goliath</a> - Restricts summoning from the extra deck, often brought out with hieratic link during the Opp turn.  <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> - sort of outclasses other Chaos monsters as he can be brought out even if you only have lights / darks in grave. Revives a monster in def if you only use lights, pops 2 if you use both attributes, Shuffles a random card from the opp if you. This card is really popular. Searchable by melody just like his handloop brother below  <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of t he Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of t he Lair</a> - if a Dark monster is tributed, (Dark thunder dragon for thunder dragon Collosus for example) he can special summon himself from the hand / graveyard even if he was not originaly there the excact moment dark monster was tributed.

Not really utilized anywhere since D- ruler ban  <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> - He can summon himself from the hand/grave by reducing his own level so that the combined level of him and the monster he targeted is 7.

Super popular card  <a data-name=""Arkbrave Dragon"">Arkbrave Dragon</a> - Back in the days when Dark Matter Dragon was legal, he was how people used to drop the Amorphage Goliath on their Opp  <a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a> - Kinda outclassed by Levianeer nowdays as he requires specifically 3 Dark monsters in the graveyard. he can banish a dark monster to pop a card that is not once per turn so he can essentially pop a bunch of times, just keep putting darks in the graveyard. Eventho this card was F&amp;L list it really ain't that scarry  <strong><a data-name=""Dark Armed, the Dragon of Annihilation"">Dark Armed, the Dragon of Annihilation</a></strong> - If you have exactly 5 dark monsters in your graveyard you can use 1 level 5 or Higher dark Dragon to summon him.

Redmd, Diabolos and <a data-name=""Aether, the Evil Empowering Dragon"">Aether, the Evil Empowering Dragon</a> are probably your best targets to revive of him. Speaking of Aether he is easly the BEST CARD to summon of Hieratic link  <a data-name=""Darkflare Dragon"">Darkflare Dragon</a> - Chaos Dragon which foolishes Dragons by sending dragons from hand then he can also banish any card in either Graveyard. MASSIVE potentional now that Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon is banned as he was inhibiting Konami from printing Dragons which are worth foolishing for the most part  <a data-name=""Instant fusion"">Instant fusion</a> - into <a data-name=""Darkfire dragon"">Darkfire dragon</a>. Free lvl 4 dark dragon drop.  <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon</a> - Look you either summon Aether, Amorphage monsters or this card via hieratic link.

He is just a an easy lvl 4 dragon tuner which you can ss via Quick Launch and at that point start climbing.. do something like Boreload Savage Dragon  <a data-name=""Storm Dragon"">Storm Dragon</a> - If you control a spellcaster you can drop him on the field. He is fantastic in Crusadia as their link 1 and reclusia are both spellcasters and Crusadia has an unique approach to Guardragon combos as their link2 moves zones setting up Elpy / Pisty  <a data-name=""Crusadia Draco"">Crusadia Draco</a> - searchable of Crusadia link 1. The reason why Crusadia is one of the best decks for creating Massive locks via Guardragons  <a data-name=""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"">Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm</a> - 1 card full scale which is relevant in rokkets, other then that one of the most popular dragons as he can revive himself giving you a plus if you decide to run gate zero.  <a data-name=""Gateway Dragon"">Gateway Dragon</a> - He can SS himself if your Opp controls a monster and then you can special summon 1 levle 4 or lower Dark draogn from the hand. Overall he is one card link 2 dragon if you will. Decent going second side option if you want to accelerate your deck  <a data-name=""Iron Dragon Tiamaton"">Iron Dragon Tiamaton</a> - If 3 cards are in the same Column which you can do by yourself you can drop him anywhere then destroy all cards in its Column. Doesn't really go well with Dragon decks atm, as they don't fill up S/T for the most part but he found its place in many other decks.  <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Drago"">Koa'ki Meiru Drago</a> - he restricts everyone from summoning Light / Dark monsters.

Idk sounds interesting but nothing groundbreaking tbh  <strong><a data-name=""Soldier Dragon"">Soldier Dragon</a></strong>. Once per turn if Opp actives a card or an effect (quick) you can special summon lvl 2 or lower dragon from the deck.

Battle damage is the last resort in this deck.,"Really straightforward. Vijam is your key card. Normal Summon it or Special Summon it via reasoning. Then tribute it for geira guile. Duza acts as a graveyard set up by sending a vijam to the GY, then geira guile or dark garnex can SS 2 vijams instead of 1 from the gy. Cubic traps and spells help disable monsters by placing cubic counters on them, making them useless. Also Mask of Restrict stop your opponent from doing Anything. It won't effect you as the cubic monster SEND the to GY to SS themselves. Twin twisters, back row removal. The reason I didn't add more back row removal is because most of the cubic monsters in this deck deal effect damage. Btw I don't recomment summoning Crimson Nova to slowly burn you and your opponent. I only summon it in desperate situations. Which are few because in most cases, your field consists of low-attack monsters and your opponent has high attack monsters. Then you draw Crimson Nova, then it's useless unless you have 3 other cubic monsters with DIFFERENT Names. So Crimson Nova is basically used for fusion Summoning. Also Linkuribo with vijam just in case."

Don't remember), and it was really unpolished, there was barely any back row removal, the deck itself was not great (aka World Legacy Whispers was in the main deck...). But now I experimented with this deck in tournaments and got first place. The other Mekk-Knight Invoked deck I used didn't get pretty far. So hopefully you guys agree that this deck is alright...

The reason i added Justicia and Promineses is because i dont see the point in synchro summoning. Sure it's effective, but I wanted a different approach. I prefer making a purely link based Guardragon Crusadia (sure there is Ib the World Chalice Justicia in my side deck, but that's for back-ups). Everything runs pretty well in this deck, i participated in my local card store tournaments and normally do pretty well in them. You guys might say that this deck is missing World Legacy Successor, and some other cards, but I'm working on it! I don't have the cards other people have okay? I'm not that rich... This deck is the eXACT same deck as the deck I use IRL, so i wanted it to be based on what I have IRL. Don't Ask."

Chain Burn has been around for forever and has progressed as different cards have come along in Yugioh. This build I have been testing, from scratch of course, did very well in testing and has a low brick rate. And yes, this deck is for competitive use just like all the other decks I post! I have some very spicy techs for you guys that I alone. have come up with that no one knows about... The first one is abusing <a data-name=""Dimensional Fissure"">Dimensional Fissure</a> and <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a>. The fact that Orcust, Sky Striker, Danger Thunder are a thing in this meta is a serious problem. To solve this problem, resolving one of these two cards could mean the end of the game for an Orcust or Sky Striker player. Banishing everything in their graveyard really hurts. And sure they can go into <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and just pop it but it should at least buy you a turn or two. The way to use Macro Cosmos properly is to flip it when your opponent goes to use a card that sends a card to the graveyard like <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a>, that way it will be banished instead which would kill their Orcust combo for the most part, forcing them to change their plans. And honestly, Chain Burn could care less if their monsters, spells and traps get banished. For the extra deck some of you might be confused, but they are all just <a data-name=""Waking The Dragon"">Waking The Dragon</a> targets. Clara &amp; Ruska is to out <a data-name=""Secret Village of The Spellcasters"">Secret Village of The Spellcasters</a>. Since I play <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagence"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, it is important that the extra deck has two or three of every important card, most importantly, <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon"">Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon</a>. Falcon is almost impossible to get over and they are forced to make weird plays to go into Borrelsword or something with higher attack than 3500 to out it. Now for the other spicy techs... Those are in the side deck. Firstly, I want to introduce <a data-name=""Volcanic Queen"">Volcanic Queen</a> with <a data-name=""Soul of Fire"">Soul of Fire</a>. Why play kaijus when we can play this nasty package? Volcanic Queen literally threatens you in the card text saying ""During your End Phase, either Tribute 1 other monster or take 1000 damage."" That's kinda a scary threat consider we're playing Chain Burn and to a Sky Striker player, summoning this card can be harmful since they cannot activate cards like Engage or any deck that is effected by kaijus. Now, the whole idea behind Soul of Fire is being able to inflict 1250 to your opponent and banishing a Volcanic Queen from your deck, which is a lot of damage. Also allowing your opponent to draw a card is a good thing because it just means more damage towards <a data-name=""Secret Barrel"">Secret Barrel</a> and the other burn cards. My other spicy tech is <a data-name=""Timidity"">Timidity</a>. When you know your opponent is siding in <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> or any backrow removal, just side these bad boys in and your opponent will have no idea what hit them when you chain everything during your opponents turn and they can't destroy them when they are set. Lastly, I want to mention that yes Ash is a threat to this deck, but in order to win vs Ash you just bait it. For example if you have <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> and <a data-name=""Card of Demise"">Card of Demise</a> in hand you would want to set the Demise and activate the Duality, forcing them to negate it with Ash because they think you are desperate for a card since its the only card in your hand. But after they negate it just flip Demise and draw 3. I hope you guys enjoy this deck profile and stick around for more!"

The main 2 cards you'll use are house duston and goblin king. Once they're both on the feild, attack a face up attack position monster with house duston to try to kill house duston. Once that happens, you can summon as many duston monsters on either side of the field as you want. Give yourself monsters like white duston and house duston, because they can be tributed. Give your opponent everything else. Attack one of the dustons on your opponent's side of the field with goblin king. Goblin king's attack is the number of fiend type monsters ×1000. So if you play your cards right, you can get an otk. Or maybe even an ftk. If you're backed into the corner, dip into your extra deck. I recommend lion heart."

Key cards in successfully employing the oppressive Altergeist strategy include:  • Multifaker: It can bring out Silq for a free bounce, it can bring out Meluseek to set up your next turn (can be used as Link fodder on your next turn or popped during your opponent's turn by the likes of Hexstia or Protocol for a search) / bring out removal, or it can bring out Kunqueary for an impermanence-esque effect.  • Hexstia: It can serve as a trap / spell negate which is significant in this day and age with Striker, Orcust and Salamangreat having powerful spell/trap cards.  • Protocol: It can serve as a negate, and can set up your future turns by activating the floating effects of Hexstia and Meluseek.  With the Altergeist strategy core being discussed, it is important to understand that the best way to play altergeist is to accentuate the strengths of this strategy; the ability to prevent the opponent from making meaningful progress (through a variety of negation, bounce and removal effects). Hand-traps, consistency boosters (draw cards) and traps that can play against the opponent whilst powering multifaker are all good choices. So, without further ado, we'll now discuss the cards that aid this strategy - from this decklist.  • Most of the traps in this lineup either boost the consistency of the altergeist strategy (spoofing, manifestation), are part of the core strategy (protocol) or aid in the oppression. The traps that aid in the oppression that Altergeist is known for are all, for the most part, able to be trap tricked - which helps increase the pace of this deck by giving it immediate answers to an opponent via trap trick. Trap trick, in this deck, can setup Secret Village of the Spellcasters to shut down a Sky Striker player... it can bring out Magic Deflector to shut down a field spell like The Hidden City... it can bring out a heavy storm duster to blow back the mirror match or to prevent any backrow setup by another deck... and lastly it can bring out an impermanence for a monster effect negate.  • The hand traps in this decklist are all there to prevent the opponent from gaining an advantage. Gnomaterial is significant in that it can shut down most T1 decks early on, while Ash &amp; Ogre hit a variety of strategies with the negation / destruction they threaten. D.D. crow in the side &amp; Phantazmay allow the deck to be more versatile going 2nd; potentially hitting GY targets for GY centric decks with D.D. Crow, and potentially seeing more hand traps with Phantazmay.  • Secret Village can be replaced with Necro Valley (just 1 necro valley + 2 secret village is fine too); both of these field spells hit strong meta-strategies incredibly hard."

So sit back, relax, and read this guide if you ever wanted to learn how to play this deck.  When playing Tindangles, it is best to think of your entire deck as consisting of trap cards. Since your monsters are mainly flip monsters, they will usually have to remain face down for a turn if you want their effects to go off. What this usually means is that you need to be thinking one step ahead of your opponent and taking into account which cards on your field they are most likely to destroy, which leads us to the next point.  The Graveyard:  Tindangles benefit heavily from being in the graveyard as their trap, Tindangle Delaunay, can be banished to immediately summon three to your field face down. That being said, there are some things to keep in mind when playing around with your graveyard: <ol>  	<li>Always try and dump Tindangle Delaunay or Nagel's protection with Foolish Burial Goods into the graveyard to set up plays for later or get protection for your monsters on the field respectively.</li>  	<li>Try and always keep Tindangle Intruder and Tindangle Apostle in the graveyard. Intruder summons itself from the GY if another monster is special summoned face down, and Apostle will allow you to get some crazy draw power the turn you flip it up after summoning it back to the field using Delaunay.</li> </ol> The hand:  There are also some things to keep in mind with the cards you want in your hand. Most of the time you always want to set Tindangle Angel or Tindangle Trinity as they are your big combo starters and allow the deck to start chugging along. Tindangle Base Gardna often ends up as a brick so try and keep it in the deck or graveyard as much as possible. Tindangle Hound is the odd one out as you should keep it in your hand if you have an Angel set, otherwise, keep it in the GY as often as possible.  The Strategy:  This deck is often very slow to get started, but once you have several copies of Delaunay in the GY it can be extremely hard to stop. Always start your turn either setting Angel or Trinity and try to keep their defense bolstered with Nagel's Protection. If Nagel's ends up getting destroyed, don't worry, its Graveyard effect lets you add another copy of itself to your hand, as well as discard a Tindangle card to the GY. If you do not have a monster to set, it is best to stall using Needlebug Nest to try and dump three Tindangles and a Delaunay to summon them on your opponent's turn and keep drawing and discarding cards using Hand Destruction. If you need to stall even further, you can often cripple your opponent early with a well timed Solemn Strike or Warning. Once you have the resources, you want to summon Tindangle Acute Cerberus (preferably with a Trinity as a material as it will allow you to add a Gergonne's End to your hand for some extra protection and dump a Delaunay in the GY in case Cerberus dies. On another note, you must also use Base Gardna as a material or else Cerberus will not gain any attack points). With such a huge monster on the field and the multiple layers of defense you will have in case it somehow dies, you are pretty much free to continue attacking for game. Also make sure to use the rest of your Extra Deck as a toolbox for various situations you may encounter."

The pros of the deck is to cripple your opponent by making them discard all the time with the pell and traps.  You dont have to mind crush blindly since some of the discard cards let you see your opponent hand.

The lynchpin of this mechanic is the effect of ""<a title=""Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dakki,_the_Graceful_Mayakashi"">Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi</a>"". It can be easily Special Summoned by ""<a title=""Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Hajun,_the_Winged_Mayakashi"">Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi</a>"", enabling the first Synchro Summon. The said Synchro Monsters are <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Side-unique"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Side-unique"">side-unique</a> and have 2 effects, following the pattern below:  <i>● If your Synchro Monster whose original Level is [two Levels higher than its own original Level] is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect while this card is in your GY: You can banish 1 other Zombie monster from your GY, and if you do, Special Summon this card.</i> <i>● If this card is Special Summoned from the GY: You can [...]</i>  The only exception to the first effect is ""<a title=""Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gashadokuro,_the_Skeletal_Mayakashi"">Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi</a>"", a Level 11 monster that requires a Link monster to be destroyed, instead. The archetype in fact has a Link monster, the Link-2 ""<a title=""Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki-Onna,_the_Ice_Mayakashi"">Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi</a>"", that cannot be targeted for attacks while pointing to a Synchro Monster and that halves the ATK/DEF of a monster when a Synchro Monster is destroyed by the opponent.  The second Trigger Effect of the ""Mayakashi"" monsters range from immunity against destruction/effects to card destruction and Deck milling. They can be used by being preemptively Special Summoned from the Graveyard by generic effects such as ""<a title=""Book of Life"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Life"">Book of Life</a>"", ""<a title=""Mezuki"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>"", and ""<a title=""Call of the Haunted"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>"", for example, or by ""<a title=""Mayakashi Metamorphosis"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mayakashi_Metamorphosis"">Mayakashi Metamorphosis</a>"". The two latter can be used to disrupt the opponent's plays, by Special Summoning the ""Mayakashi"" during their turn. Also, if their second effect is triggered by their own <a title=""Condition"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Condition"">condition</a>, they can be combined with ""<a title=""Shiranui"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shiranui"">Shiranui</a>"" monsters, that can have their effects triggered when banished, especially ""<a title=""Shiranui Spiritmaster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shiranui_Spiritmaster"">Shiranui Spiritmaster</a>"".  “<a title=""Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki-Musume,_the_Ice_Mayakashi"">Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi</a>” adds more versatility and consistency to the deck, as she makes it easier to quickly link summon “<a title=""Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yuki-Onna,_the_Ice_Mayakashi"">Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi</a>” and continue climbing the Synchro ladder. In addition to that, her effect to send any Zombie of your choice from your deck to the GY once she’s special summoned from your hand or GY means that cards like “<a title=""Doomking Balerdroch"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Doomking_Balerdroch"">Doomking Balerdroch</a>”, “<a title=""Glow-Up Bloom"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Glow-Up_Bloom"">Glow-Up Bloom</a>”, and “<a title=""Necroworld Banshee"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Necroworld_Banshee"">Necroworld Banshee</a>” are now more realistic options for the deck, and also allow a “<a title=""Zombie World"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_World"">Zombie World</a>” engine to be more viable.  “<a title=""Mayakashi Winter"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Mayakashi_Winter"">Mayakashi Winter</a>” also helps with the OTK strategy by reducing the ATK of your opponent’s monsters, and it helps that multiple copies will stack on top of each other while on the field. Usually when you’re done climbing the Synchro ladder, you’re left with a “<a title=""Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dakki,_the_Graceful_Mayakashi"">Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi</a>” on the field that’s not doing anything so you can use this card’s effect to send it to the GY to draw a new card."
