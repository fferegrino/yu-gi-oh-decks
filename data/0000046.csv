Easily able to get out all 3 borrel link monsters (for eaxample) first turn but open to both improvement and strategy improvisation.  The opening turn typically begins with special summoning two Rokkets with either Boot Sector Launch, Gateway Dragon, Quick Revolve, etc. Then link summoning Romulus and adding Dragons Ravine to hand. Or if you opened with Destrudo: Chrystron Needlefiber and using him to special summon Rokket Synchron. Then you normal summon a Rokket, if you used Romulus, use Dragons Ravine to send Destrudo to the grave and special it out with its effect. Link summon the little guardragons to the zones your link monster points to. Elpy summons Darkness Metal who then let's you summon any Rokket from the grave. Use either Darkness metal and Romulus to link summon the link 2 guardragon to the other extra monster zone. Darkness Metal and Elpy to make Sawnborrel if you summoned needlefiber. Ptsy re summons Darkness Metal, who summons Romulus from the grave. Or another Rokket on the needlefiber route. Honestly I can't remember the rest of the combos at this point but you should get the idea."

My best deck I've ever used,"Finally... I am uploading my best and the favorite deck I've ever used. This deck consists of 3 engines of this deck. This explains why the side deck might look weird: <ol>  	<li>Kaiju Engine (Main Engine) (3 Kyouto Waterfront, 1 Gameciel, 1 Thunder King, 1 Hieratic Seal, 1 Photon Blast Dragon)</li>  	<li>Azathot Engine (1 Nyarla, 1 Azathot, 2 Jigabyte, 2 Archfiend Eater, 1 Inari Flame)</li>  	<li>Cat/Beast Engine (3 Rescue Cat, 1 Elephun, 1 Magical Mid-Breaker Field, 1 Naturia Beast, 1 Bamboozling Gossip Shadow)</li> </ol> You can change your deck engines to different versions in order to counter your opponent's decks. If you haven't realized yet, the cards you need to replace for side decking are only the 7 cards. I hope you enjoy using my best deck! Comment on what I can improve! (BTW, you can replace Reactor Dragon and Winged Kuriboh LV9 with any Level 9 as you wish EXCEPT World Legacy Guardragon Mardark)"

Focuses on spell counter generation while gaining card advantage leading ,"The main idea of the deck is to create spell counters while gaining card advantage over your opponent. Focusing mostly around using Servant of Endymion for your starting plays and along with Electrumite, you can regularly have a 3-4 negate board. Spellbooks along with their link monster Crowley can generate spell counters and draw you cards at any time for 2 monsters. Cerberus and Chronograph work incredibly well together and also act as starters for the deck as link fodder. Ending with King Jackal and Endymion to counter whatever your opponent has to play. Every turn except the first is focused on using Endymion's pendulum effect and Cerberus removal effect."

Black Luster Soldiers and their variants in all their,This Deck focuses on getting out Black Luster Soldiers or the Black Luster Super Soldiers out as quick as possible while maintaining a relatively safe position. Just focus on getting as many of the Black Luster Soldier variants out on the field as possible. After that you can spice things up by using them for xyz summoning and basically seal the deal for a quick and successful duel. This deck has worked phenomenally for me and can withstand quite many of the other awesome decks out there. The only reason the Extra Deck has 15 cards in it is that I like to be prepared for everything without losing the feeling a certain Archetype or playstyle in general gives me. Xyz Monsters should be used to cement your position and to protect your monsters out on the field.

Crush your enemies.  See them driven before you. Hear the lamentations of their waifus. ,"Earlier in the month, I uploaded a Danger Darkworld deck based around going second, breaking boards and OTKing. My friend submitted to me a challenge; he feels that Blue-eyes Dangers would be better at it than my version. That shot at my Dark World Bois aside, I concluded there might be merit to that idea and decided to try to make that version of the deck. This is that. - Go second - Break the board - OTK, ideally by giving them a 0 Def Big Foot in Def with Jackalope and Creature Swap then attacking with Chaos MAX  In all honesty, this version of the deck has a lot of marked similarities to the Dark World one, just with different faces. Different places. Instead of Grapha popping something on discard, it's Alternative popping something as it comes out. Instead of Snoww searching more resources, it's Melody. Instead of Dark World Dealings, we've got Trade-Ins (which makes me less nervous about running Lava Golem right from the start, lemme tell 'ya). I'm not 100% sure if it'll be better, but it certainly hits the same sweet spots. I just wonder if I'm not actually running enough of the Blue Eyes stuff to merit the change, but still think it'll be more than capable of doing what I need it to do. And the inclusion of one of my all-time favorite boss monsters (who can't be targeted so shove your Anchors up your rear, Sky Strikers) is a decidedly delectable plus. It actually makes an OTK safer, since you don't have to completely empty a board, only take away the annoying parts of the backrow and the most problematic monsters that will stop Big MAX from doing what he does best to that poor, unsuspecting Bigfoot. The downside, of course, is that you increase your chance for clogging. I know, a deck that is at least 40% Danger cards shouldn't feasibly be able to clog, but there you have it none the less. If I start with 2-3 Blue-Eyes White Dragons in hand, not only am I getting nothing from those unless I see Trade-In, I am also down two targets for Melody. It's a little worrying is all. But I want to try it like this first, with the classic numbers for Blue-Eyes, before I probably cut the titular monster to 2. I mean, MAX, Alternative, Levianeer, they're all targets as well. But I'm running them all at 1, so whether that becomes an issue or not will largely be up to the testing labs to figure out. In the end, I predict the numbers will definitely be changed with some of these cards, but I've got a good feeling about it.  And please, please, feel free to drop a comment with suggestions about how to make this deck better at it's job; breakin' boards and doin' work. Just don't bother telling me about how Called By The Grave should be in the main. It's not that I disagree, I just think that I've got enough effects to burn through one or two and still be able to do what needs doing, or to get into Azathot before things get too bad."

Surprisingly, it is another Ritual Deck ;). <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a>: Of course, for the Ritual Summon of <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a>.</li>  	<li>Impcantation monsters: For searching Ritual Spells / Ritual Monsters and to shift control to your opponent for an OTK.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"">Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</a>: Same as the Impcantations: To search Ritual Spells / Ritual Monsters.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a>: The main reason for the 12 Link Monsters, she acts as a 0 DEF monster for an OTK, but also searchable. The only note is Special Summon her before any Impcantation monster because the Impcantations will block you from Link Summon, causing a problem in sending her to the GY. In that case, consider paying some LP if your opponent has any monster in Attack Position by attacking them, then Special Summon her for your opponent to win.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a>: Well, there's not much to say. A 4000 ATK monster with self-protection and ""double damage"". It is the soul of this deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a>: A cool card for an Impcantation monster to be Special Summoned, but note that this can cause you a 2500 LP loss, but it can also act as destruction for one of your opponent's monster.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Shien's Spy"">Shien's Spy</a>: A card for shifting a monster to your opponent's field. Combine with a <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> on the field will result in an 8000 damage.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Mystic Box"">Mystic Box</a>: Same as <a data-name=""Shien's Spy"">Shien's Spy</a>, but although it can destroy 1 monster your opponent controls, it requires your opponent to have one. So if your opponent has no monster, this card can be a blank card. Otherwise, this can be a better <a data-name=""Shien's Spy"">Shien's Spy</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>: Search <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a> and recover a Ritual Spell.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a>: A Ritual Spell that is specified for Ritual Summon ""Chaos"" / ""Black Luster Soldier"". It can banish <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a> that <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> sends to your GY.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Advance Ritual Art"">Advance Ritual Art</a>: As I said above, it can Ritual Summon with just 1 Blue-Eyes White Dragon in your Deck, and it can feed your GY for <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>: Ritual Summon any monster with Impcantations, but also act as a Special Summon (from your Deck) for an Impcantation monster.</li> </ul> For the Extra Deck, the XYZ monster is for situations when you can't send any card to your opponent and you have 2+ Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon or your opponent has 4000- LP.

The strategy is to get Mystic mine out on the field by either having it or searching it. If you can't get mystic mine out on your first turn you have other traps to help stall for mystic mine.  Once you get it out, use cards like card destruction, trickster reincarnation, Present card, the book of the eclipse, and gift of greed to mill your opponent to death.  It's relatively easy to get mystic mine in this 60 card deck since you have  3 mystic mine's, 2 terraforming, and 3 metaverses.  WARNING* After getting mystic mine, do not summon any monsters. Mystic mine destroys itself if you and your opponent have the same amount of monsters."

I use most cards to put Wightprince to the GY, and send Skull Servant and The Lady in Wight (TLW) there as well. Do not banish them immediately. Wait until you get a better card for the summon or a Wightmare ,so you could special summon TLW for protection. Dont't be eager to attack, use the links and the xyz to either stall, or destroy your opponent's side of the field. Do not rush to use the spell/traps immediately, unless absolutely necessary. Ideally, you will end up with a setup in which you'll have King of the Skull Servants, TLW and a few traps for protection and the equip spells at the same time. While it is an OTK if done correctly, the optimal approach is to be carful and act accordingly to your opponent's actions. Feel free to add your ideas to this deck and have fun playing!"

I've tried to focus the strategy of the deck more around getting both <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> as fast and as efficient as possible either on the field or in the hand to fuse them. That is why I've cut out major fusion cards to make room for cards like <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, <a data-name=""Fortune Fairy Hakari"">Fortune Fairy Hakari</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Renewal"">Dark Renewal</a> to get more use out of <a data-name=""Maiden with Eyes of Blue"">Maiden with Eyes of Blue</a>. Also I have replaced <a data-name=""Dimension Guardian"">Dimension Guardian</a> with <a data-name=""Safe Zone"">Safe Zone</a>, which is more of a personal choice, because both cards work the same way.  &nbsp;  *I accidently deleted my detailed description about specific cards in this deck and why I use them ... so if you have any questions or suggestions about the deck please comment! Have a good day!*  &nbsp;  This is my second Version of mixing my favourite Monsters <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"">Blue-Eyes White Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> together. This Version does not feature any Ritual Monster. If you want to see a deck profile which incorporates both Blue-eyes and DM Ritual Monsters you can check out my first Version of this deck ""Blue-eyes Dark Magician""  <strong>Why?</strong>  '<a href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Blue-eyes%20white%20Dragon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" data-name=""Blue-eyes white Dragon"">Blue-eyes white Dragon</a>' and '<a href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dark%20Magician"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>' have always been one of my favourite Monsters in this game and I've always wanted to build a deck which incorporates both Monsters. I have already managed to build a deck like that, which is by no means competetive but it can be quite fun and even strong in casual play.  <strong>Strategy</strong>  The strategy hasn't really changed all that much from my first deck. The main goal is still to summon <a data-name=""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician the Dragon Knight</a> as fast as possible. Allthough he is not very easy to summon, once on the field he can protect all of your Spell and Trap-cards, like <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> or <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a>. If you want to make your board with him even stronger you could side in <a data-name=""Dimension Guardian"">Dimension Guardian</a>(which can be protected from him aswell) and equip it to him so he can't be destroyed by battle or card effect. Once you have him on your board you don't have to worry about cards like <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> or other annyoing cards. Also if your opponent wants to get rid of your Spells and Traps they need to deal with a 3000 ATK Monster first which may give you the advantage.  <strong>Summary</strong>  This deck will probably not win you any tournaments but I think it is really fun to play and acutually viable against certain match-ups. It's just so satisfying to swarm your board with 'Blue-eyes-' and 'Dark Magician-' Monsters and if you're lucky you can make pretty insane boards which can be annoying to deal with. I recommend you try it out yourself or give me some tips or suggestions on what I can improve. Please leave a comment, I would like to hear your thouhgts and opinions.  I think that I have improved this deck idea once again by removing all the ritual monsters. Yes, I know this deck is supposed to be for fun and all the cool and strong Ritual monsters are not in here, but in my opinion this deck turned out to be quite strong. Yes, against certain match ups that use a lot of handtraps and negating this deck can be shut down easily if you negate all my core cards like Eternal, Circle, Rod etc.  Regardless if you play against people who don't come at you with unbreakable first turn boards that feature tons of negates you actually stand a good chance and you can really do cool things with this deck.  I, personally love it.  &nbsp;"

This is the first one, as most of us know the <a data-name=""Brilliant Fusion"">Brilliant Fusion</a> hit on the banlist several banlists ago significant hurt the consistency of the Gem-Knight FTK. But the deck is still viable and this deck profile proves it. The deck is still super strong and can FTK going first and even going second the deck can get through one or two negates which is pretty good. I would say this deck is still a Tier 1 contender. In order to perform the FTK these are the steps I have gone through and came up with. I have come up with specific steps on doing the FTK after doing it constantly on ygopro and in real life. The first step is finding a way to summon to <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>. Also in your starting hand you either need <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Obsidian"">Gem-Knight Obsidian</a> or <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Fusion"">Gem-Knight Fusion</a>. This is why <a data-name=""Gem-Armadillo"">Gem-Armadillo</a> is helpful, you can normal summon it to add Obsidian if you don't have it, but also have a way to bring out a vanilla Gem-Knight for Link Spider. You will add the other one you don't have from <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz"">Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz</a>'s effect later. You need a vanilla Gem-Knight in order to summon Link Spider, which also includes needing to be able to bring out at least 2 vanillas in the beginning with extenders like <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>, <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>, <a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a> etc. this way you can go into Link Spider and use Link Spider's effect to summon another vanilla from your hand, or if you don't have one in your hand and have already got 2 more vanilla Gem-Knights plus the Link Spider then you're good to go for the next step. After this, you need to use the 2 vanillas you have or whatever 2 Gem- monsters you have on the field to go into Phantom Quartz under Link Spider and use Quartz's effect to add the other one you are missing from your hand (either Gem-Knight Fusion or Gem-Knight Obsidian). Then use Gem-Knight Fusion to fuse Phantom Quartz and the Obsidian to make <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Zirconia"">Gem-Knight Zirconia</a> and use Obsidian's effect to special summon <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Tourmaline"">Gem-Knight Tourmaline</a> that you should have in your graveyard, from your graveyard. Then use these 3 to summon <a data-name=""Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion"">Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion </a>and use her effect to send <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> from your deck to graveyard, or if you already have Block Dragon in your hand you could send Gem-Knight Fusion or whatever will benefit your current situation. Your main goal in these first 3 steps is to make Curious so if you have a way to make it after making a Phantom Quartz instead of Link Spider or something else then make Curious and proceed from there. There can be very awkward situations and you have to figure out what it is you need in order to do these steps correctly. Anyways, after you make Curious, you need to banish 3 earth monsters from your graveyard to summon Block Dragon and use Block Dragon and Curious to go into <a data-name=""Proxy Dragon"">Proxy Dragon</a>. Once Proxy Dragon hits the field go ahead and use Block Dragon's effect to add another Gem-Knight Obsidian, a <a data-name=""Crystal Rose"">Crystal Rose</a>, and <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Lapis"">Gem-Knight Lapis</a>. Also, keep note that you MUST keep Gem-Knight Obsidian until the end, which I will explain later, otherwise you cannot pull off the FTK. Next, use Gem-Knight Fusion again (you need to recur it from the grave several times by banishing Gem-Knights from your grave) to fuse Proxy Dragon and the Gem-Knight Lapis you added off Block Dragon to go into <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Seraphinite"">Gem-Knight Seraphinite</a>. Normal summon Crystal Rose and use its effect to send <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Lazuli"">Gem-Knight Lazuli</a> from your deck to graveyard and use her effect to add back the Lapis you just used for fusion material to summon Seraphinite. Now use Seraphinite and Crystal Rose (Renamed as Gem-Knight Lapis) to go into the second Phantom Quartz on the left extra monster zone. Go ahead and use Crystal Rose's second effect in graveyard to banish Seraphinite to special summon it underneath Phantom Quartz. Use Crystal Rose's effect again to send another Gem-Knight Lazuli from your deck to add back another vanilla from your grave to hand. Now special summon Block Dragon by banishing 3 earth monsters from your graveyard to the second to last right zone. Now use Phantom Quartz's second effect to pay 1000 life points to shuffle back into the deck the first banished Phantom Quartz that should have been banished off Gem-Knight Fusion's recur effect or Block Dragon's summon, a Gem-Knight Lazuli and any other banished Gem-Knight monster to summon <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond"">Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond</a> to left most zone where Phantom Quartz is pointing to. Now use Gem-Knight Fusion to fuse Gem-Knight Lapis in your hand plus the Obsidian you added off Block Dragon to fusion summon <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli"">Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli</a> in the middle zone where Phantom Quartz is pointing to. Use Obsidian's effect to special summon the Lapis in your grave to the right most zone. Now use Lady Lapis Lazuli's effect to send the second copy of herself from the extra deck to the graveyard to burn your opponent for 3000 life points. Then proceed to activate Lady Brilliant Diamond's effect to tribute the Lady Lapis Lazuli to summon <a data-name=""Gem-Knight Master Diamond"">Gem-Knight Master Diamond</a> and use his effect to banish a Lady Lapis Lazuli to burn your opponent for another 3000 life points. Getting to the finale, use Block Dragon and Phantom Quartz to go into <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> and pitch a card to shuffle back Master Diamond back into the extra deck. Now banish 3 earths again except the second Lady Lapis Lazuli to special summon Block Dragon again anywhere except under Unicorn. Use Gem-Knight Fusion to fuse the Crystal Rose that is renamed, the Gem-Knight Lapis on the field and another Gem-Knight in your hand to fusion summon Master Diamond again.

This deck uses flips and the effects of the Subterror to repeat the flip effects in a way that can summon big mons","Most of the strategy revolves around setting your flip monsters and using <a data-name=""Subterror Guru"">Subterror Guru</a> to set the back down after using their effects, being able to also summon <a data-name=""Subterror Umastryx"">Subterror Behemoth Umastryx</a> and <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Armor&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Armor""</a> in the process to have control over the board with big minions and strong effects that banish(Umastryx) or destroy(<a data-name=""Krawler Spine"">Krawler Spine</a>) monsters.  You should work with what u have, so if u can summon Umastryx u should link summon Subterror Behemoth Fiendess and start flip summoning to take advantage of her effects. If not u should try to controll the board and wait for a Guru so you can search Umastryx or a World Legacy's Mind Meld to activate your Krawler's second effect to summon <a data-name=""Deus X-Krawler"">Deus X-Krawler</a> and another Krawler (depends on the situation but Spine or Axon are usually better as they provide a good defence)  <a data-name=""Golem Sentry"">Golem Sentry</a> can use the effect to turn itself face-down and start a combo with Umastryx, that can summon a second or even third one if you are lucky.  Lastly, <a data-name=""Tindangle Angel"">Tindangle Angel</a> is used, of course, to special summon flip monsters from your hand, but its effect can be very usefull to bring out Umastryx for your hand or GY when there is no way to flip monsters face-down, becoming na easy way to start the combo wih the Subterror Fiendess  You  will understand the deck as you play but these are some tips i can give for now."

","This elite Kozmo deck is designed to get you the W. Has been played by me for a while and I've recently finish perfecting it for meta. 12-0 deck that can easily combat meta decks. Summoning in and out of your big ships is the way to land a 1-2 turn OTK. With Dark Destroyer at 3, there are too many combos to name. Whether you want to go first or second is up to you because it can handle both but I think first plays better because of the negation/counter cards. You can end first with a tincan and call of haunted or go second using struggle battle amongst many other plays. This runs through stall decks that use cards like mind crush. This is my favorite deck because it is consistent pretty much all the time and I've had a couple of people ask me for it. Test it out. Get a feel for it with some hands in the simulator and on YGOPRO and see for yourself. This deck has quick plays with the same level or better as meta. Leave a comment and let me know what you think. Have fun and lets duel :)"

I put in 2 widget kids to combo/ special out a Salamangreat to trigger an effect like Fowl, combo with foxy/lady debug/ spinny effect from hand in order swarm and get your links/xyz out ( side note: widget kid to jack jag/falco act fowl effect makes it easier and quicker to get your dweller out to lock your opponent from using the graveyard which can be useful.) Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner is an interesting card which activates when a fire monster on your side is destroyed to special it out and inflict half attack of a fire monster in your grave for burn damage and disrupt with 2600 atk . Salamangreat recurrence to the place of fusion of fire to recycle your Salamangreat's. Mole came in for coyote to use its effect to recycle 5 Salamangreat's back into the deck. As for the extra deck 2 Pyro Phoenix took the place of Violet Chimera and Topologic Bomber Dragon which is basically a Zorovoros with out the banish and gain attack effect but instead it has burn effect in which you be using effect 2 on it to burn your opponent when they link summon. The side is essentially the same except since some card came out and replaced other the only new additions are Crusadia Reclusia, Violet Chimera and Super Poly.
