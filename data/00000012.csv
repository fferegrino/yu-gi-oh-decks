CHAZZ IT UP,"The main objective of this deck is to get ADT lv10 out as consistently as humanly possibly, however Dragoon is the better win condition, so aim for that if you can.  Best endboard I remember getting is dragoon, ADT lv10, AD lightning and 3 blank cards in hand, however the most likely end board is either dragoon or ADT lv10 + AD lightning on field with 3-4 cards in hand. The deck can often play through 1 negate, but usually never more than that.  Deck was tested on Edopro casual servers, and has decent matchups. I would put this deck at tier 3/rouge, however it is probably just garbage haha. Armed Dragons would have better synergy with dragon link,  rather than ojama but I haven't figured out how to make that work yet.  *DECKBUILDING NOTES*  This deck is built with consistency as its number 1 priority, so if a card wasn't consistent, it was cut.  Ojama pajama and Ojamagic are not being run as they are way too sacky, inconsistent, etc.  AD lv10- white, could be played but I think Arma gram is <em>slightly</em> better  upstart isn't played as it can brick with Extravagance  Volcanic shell can be played - but space issues  AD blitz and AD thunderbolt can be played - but space issues  A second ADT lv10 is not recommended - too many issues  Lightning storm and evenly matched can be ANY card you want.  *DUELING NOTES*  I'm finding most success in 3 match duels where I go second on the first duel, where afterwards I side 5 solemn negates and I choose to go first. No one really knows how this deck works so mind gaming your opponent is where it's at right now.  Don't activate ojama pinks effect unless your hand is garbage,  it's only helping your opponent find a hand trap and thin their deck.  It's ALWAYS better to make a Dragoon endboard rather than ADT endboar; if you have a choice but can't do both.  This deck has no recursion. Once ADT lv10 and dragoon die you will only have arma gram and tempest as win conditions - so play with that in mind  Combo's are all very simple - nothing you won't figure out by yourself :)"

If you know how to use Mayakashi's then you're good. But for those that don't know, here's a quick info. Mayakashi's work when there's one of its name on the field, Meaning you can't summon two Yasha's on the field at the same time so you're stuck with the one. Also, Mayakashi's work by using their Synchro Summoning method, but make sure you read the effects of the Mayakashi Synchro Monsters and know what you're gonna summon. Also, for the Synchro Summoning method, if you used Dakki for a Synchro, then you're gonna use her over and over and over again for MANY synchro summoning for Mayakashi Synchros, because Dakki gets special summoned if a Mayakashi Synchro monster was special summoned from the extra deck.  This deck also has other cards that'll help special summon monsters from your graveyard, including Mayakashi Synchro monsters to activate their effects to help turn things around if you're low on monsters and you need a wall. Every Mayakashi Synchro monster special summoned from the grave, their effects are activated and depending which you use, they are helpful to get your opponent in a difficult position.  Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon is in this deck that can help because of its effect in gaining 100 ATK and DEF for the zombies in your field or graveyard. You can add Zombie World field spell but that's only if you want to make the deck become a competitive deck, but seeing I made this for fun, this is what you get.  As for your side cards, you can get some combos if you got Robbin' Zombie and special summoned from the grave Tsuchigumo, the Poisonous Mayakashi.

Xyz revive splash is used to rank-up Number 101 or Bahamut Shark (after it's summoned another xyz) into either Valiant Lancer or Silent Honor Dark. When going second, utilize Utopia double and the White Aura Synchros to potentially OTK your opponent. 3 Moray of Greed can be replaced with other consistency boosting cards (Instant Fusion is one possibility). The Extra deck can be further edited to account for personal preference (running more copies of Toad is certainly viable even though the card can recur itself). Note: As of the current date on which this profile was submitted, some cards in the list have not yet been imported into the TCG."

Prime Photon detaching Afterglow gets boosted to 11200 on its own, so you can OTK over anything with 3200 or less.  Photon Sanctuary is basically RotA, it makes Union Carrier to equip Orbital which searches your entire deck. Usually you'll search Galaxy Soldier then with that search Galaxy Knight, but you might search either of your big dragons too. It's also non-OPT, so multiples let you summon your other links for free.  Galaxy Trance is amazing for pushing through interruption. As long as you have Photon Dragon in grave, it summons it and then Afterglow from deck. NOTE: You're locked out of the Union Carrier play if you want to do this.  No Galaxy Expedition because it just bricks us more. Hyper Galaxy is potentially strong, especially since it summons a Photon Dragon, but in practice its a huge minus if it whiffs and some boards don't have a 2000+ atk monster.  Don't be afraid to summon Photon Dragon by it's own effect if you already have Afterglow in hand, but always be sure your Prime Photon will stick before you specifically commit to it.  If you expect to go first games 2 or 3 just side in the Dragon Buster and equip it to Hope Harbinger.

It is always important that Mighty Guard delivers the finishing blow, otherwise it is pointless having him in the deck other than to just look pretty, which he does!"

Special thanks to Seniorious for helping me with the techs and extra-deck the night before YCS 10. </span></span>  <span><span><b>2. Decklist and Techs</b></span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Main-deck: The Usual Suspects</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Aleister the Invoker x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>We begin </span></span><span><span>with one of the best normal summons of the year: Aleister the Invoker. </span></span><span><span>Playable in decks from Mek</span></span><span><span>k-</span></span><span><span>Knight to Eldlich he forms the summon portion of a 10-card Invoked engine that generates repeated negates and board presence turn after turn. If you are unfamiliar </span></span><span><span>the standard opening play is to find and normal summon Aleister before using his effect to search Invocation before linking him off for Salamangreat Almiraj and Secure Gardna in turn. This gives us materi</span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span>l in grave for not only summoning Invoked Mechaba this turn but also for summoning Invoked Purgatrio for a swift </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> next turn. </span></span><span><span>Another thing to note is Aleister’s second effect that allows us to boost the at</span></span><span><span>tac</span></span><span><span>k of</span></span><span><span><i> any fusion monster,</i></span></span><span><span> even during the damage step. This can be used to save one of our fusions from battle destruction or to help with our </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span> We have seven-</span></span><span><span>ish</span></span><span><span> main-deck copies of Aleister so </span></span><span><span>about a</span></span><span><span><b> 65%</b></span></span><span><span> to open one mak</span></span><span><span>es</span></span><span><span> this opening play highly consistent. I don’t think there's an Invoked build out there that wants to run less than three Aleisters so I’d stick with this ratio. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous x 3 </b></span></span>  <span><span>While this isn’t ideally your normal summon I thought it would make sense to group it here based on its effect. Dogmaticka Ecclesia, the Virtuous is another powerful searcher that, like Aleister, is the centre of a powerful advantage-generating engine. She can special summon herself from the hand “if there is a monster summoned from the extra deck on the field” </span></span><span><span>at which point she can search any Dogmatika card from the deck. This is easily accomplished on your first turn due to our above mentioned Aleister play allowing us to add another interruption to our opening board. </span></span><span><span>We play a total of six copies so you’ll be seeing Ecclesia about</span></span><span><span><b> 55%</b></span></span><span><span> of the time; you’ll see her and Aleister </span></span><span><span>together </span></span><span><span>about</span></span><span><span><b> 35%</b></span></span><span><span> of the time. </span></span><span><span>These are very good odds for a low investment two-to-three plus negates on your turn one board in my opinion, hence why I choose to play </span></span><span><span>three</span></span><span><span>. If you’d like to experiment with less I have tried </span></span><span><span>two </span></span><span><span>in more budget-friendly builds. </span></span> <b> </b><b> </b><b> </b>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Maximus x 1 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Next up is a controversial one. Dogmatika Maximus can be a huge swing for either player depending on the composition of both players’ extra decks. This is all due to Maximus’s high-rolling effect that lets both players send two cards from the extra deck to the grave. If the Foolish goes off unpunished you can get a huge amount of set-up or removal for free, plus the value of milling your opponent’s extra deck for at least two. The most common way you’ll see this punished is with your opponent sending a couple of their own Elder Entity N’Tss to pop your board, although some still choose to play the Cyber Dragon Nova plus Invoked Mechaba combo. Since Maximus is searchable of off Ecclesia I don’t feel like you need to main-deck more copies but siding one-to-two more could be viable depending on if you think you’ll be punished for the effect or not. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>Finally we’ll finish out this look at the main-deck monsters with Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted. It’s searchable off of Ecclesia and Titaniklad the Ash Dragon’s effects like Maximus but unlike Maximus; Fleurdelis is a quick effect. As long as there’s an extra-deck monster on the field you can special-summon Fleurdelis from hand and then if there’s a Dogmatika monster on field you can negate one face-up monster’s effect. As I mentioned with Ecclesia it’s very likely you’ll end the first turn with an extra-deck monster on the field; so this effect is live on a minimum of<b> 70%</b> of your opening boards. Now due to the wording of Fleurdelis’s effect it can't be used to hit trigger effects that activate on the field such as Stratos-style search or permanent effects like Eldlich the Golden Lord’s attack gain on summon effect. Besides those this effect will hit most any other effect activation you might need it to. We run two for that reason and because its highly searchable off of Ecclesia and Nadir but you can try three if you value opening it more. </span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Spells and Traps</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Nadir Servant x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>We begin our look at the spells with the Dogmatika searcher Nadir Servant. For the price of one monster sent from the extra deck you can search any Dogmatika monster with an at</span></span><span><span>tac</span></span><span><span>k equal or less than the monster you sent. The most common targets for this effect tend to be Titaniklad to search Ecclesia or Fleurdelis, </span></span><span><span>or</span></span><span><span> N’Tss </span></span><span><span>to</span></span><span><span> pop. You can get a max</span></span><span><span>imum</span></span><span><span> of </span></span><span><span>two </span></span><span><span>pops and an effect negate on field with this line </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> add a Mechaba to this and you have our ideal opening board. It’s important to remember </span></span><span><span>that like Punishment this effect will lock you out of the extra-deck for the rest of the turn, so make sure to fusion summon first. I would recommend always playing three Nadir if you can as it is a fantastic consistency booster for your Dogmatika lines; it boosts our chances of opening Ecclesia to</span></span><span><span><b> 58%</b></span></span><span><span> going first. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Harpie’s Feather Duster x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>The bugbear of control decks stalks through our list. Beyond Eldlich there aren’t a ton of decks that want their back-row wiped so this becomes a powerful equalizer. This came in especially clutch against other Dogmatika decks as it allows us to clear their Punishment or Impermanence with zero risk to our monsters. Incidentally like our above-mentioned Lightning Storm, Harpie’s can completely blow out lesser control decks like Guru or Monarch. I would recommend running one of these in either the main or side deck if you can afford the space. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Triple Tactics Talent x 2 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Now on to our super-pushed Called By The Grave replacement. Triple looks broken on paper as it features three of YuGiOh’s most busted card effects. Depending on the situation you can either: draw two, scout your opponents hand and discard one, or take control of an opponent’s creature. Picking the right one at the right time can end games by itself, especially against tier three decks and below. We play two copies main to counter our opponent’s Ash Blossom or Effect Veiler on our Aleister or Meltdown on turn one. You could play less but I like having a<b> 33%</b> chance to open some kind of handtrap hate. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Mind Control x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Another tech from </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/seniorious/"">Seniorious</a> <span><span>here, </span></span><span><span>M</span></span><span><span>ind </span></span><span><span>Co</span></span><span><span>ntrol is a real blowout card going second. </span></span><span><span>Most often we use it </span></span><span><span>to bait out negates from the like of Herald or Savage Dragon, as if they don’t negate it we take their largest monster. As with most of our text it’s also a huge blowout against non-meta strategies. The only weakness of this tech is the lack of uses for a taken monster beyond trading up. </span></span><span><span>If you’d like to make this pick more synergistic then I’d maybe look at playing something like the Knightmares or I:P Masquerena in the extra </span></span><span><span>deck</span></span><span><span> if you can make the space. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Terraforming x 1 </b></span></span>  <span><span>So it should be obvious why we’re playing this as it’s a fourth copy of Meltdown. If it’s not obvious Meltdown is a starter that gives our fusion summons protection and Terraforming is just another copy. There is some potential synergy with other fusion spells like Secret Village of the Spellcasters or Magical Mid-Breaker Field in order to keep Terraforming live later in the game. I would always include this in an Invoked build but if you want to drop it expect the consistency to drop.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Invocation x 3 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Invocation needs no introduction these days as one of the greatest fusion spells of all time, next to Red-Eyes Fusion. It allows us to fusion summon <i>any monster </i>and if it’s an Invoked monster we can use materials from the hand, field, or either graveyard. This can be huge as it allows us to use our follow-up plays to clear problem cards from our opponent’s graveyard. This can be used to turn problem floaters like Eldlich the Golden Lord into a Mechaba on the follow-up. Also of note is Invocation's graveyard effect that allows us to recycle our banished Aleisters for follow-ups or the convenient attack boosting effect. We run three Invocation for the increased chance to open it as Aleister’s effect attracts negates like no other and we want our opening to be consistent. You can run two if you don’t want to open it but be wary of handtraps if you do. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Super Polymerization x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Onto one of the last bad calls I made in this build. Super Polymerization is an incredible card in any fusion-based deck with flexible materials as it lets you clear threats in a way that your opponent cannot respond too. The thought for playing it here was that I could use it as a way to resolve a negated Aleister without drawing Invocation. This worked in testing against less meta strategies but struggled against the superior tempo of the tier one decks. I could see a place for this in a budget Invoked build but for meta Forbidden Droplet is a better choice. Try this if you’d like but I don’t recommend it. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Magical Meltdown x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Magical Meltdown is an essential inclusion. It functions as four more copies of Aleister and allows us to protect our fusion monsters and summons. I’ve also found it useful to bait out Ash Blossom or the occasional Ghost Ogre in scenarios where we draw Aleister and Meltdown. In the updated build I often send Magical Meltdown for Forbidden Droplet as once you’ve searched Aleister and fusion summoned it’s better to get it off the field for the plus two. Overall there's no reason to run less than three of this in any build in my opinion. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dogmatika Punishment x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>The f</span></span><span><span>inal card of our main-deck </span></span><span><span>is</span></span><span><span> one of my favourite cards in the deck. </span></span><span><span>Dogmatika Punishment is one of </span></span><span><span>only</span></span><span><span> a few playable trap cards in the current format, next to the previously mentioned Infinite Impermanence. </span></span><span><span>Punishment allows us to send a card from the extra deck to pop a monster with equal or lower attack than the monster we sent. </span></span><span><span>Half the extra deck is geared around this effect so there are a number of optimal targets depending on your situation. I’ll mention a couple here but you’ll find the rest below. The two I find myself sending on my opponent’s first turn most are N’Tss for the dual pop or Titaniklad for the follow-up Ecclesia or Maximus play. It’s important to note that Punishment locks you out of summoning till the end of your next turn, so use with caution if you plan to follow-up with Purgatrio. Some builds run two of this </span></span><span><span>b</span></span><span><span>ut I chose three in anticipation of grindy mirrors, and this payed off, however I would caution against that choice going forward. With more coverage of the deck the player base </span></span><span><span>is</span></span><span><span> likely to start siding against this strategy specifically. Expect more blowout cards and shorter games going forward. </span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Side Deck and Tech Choices</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Notes on the side </b></span></span>  <span><span>Normally I wouldn’t go into a lot of depth on the side deck as I tend to feel like sides are best as personal calls made by players with a specific meta in mind. On this occasion I've decided to analyze my picks here as I feel the meta of YCS 10 is worth exploring. Hopefully this approach helps you all make better siding choices in future events this year, as we’re not seeing a banlist update till December 15th at the earliest (<a>Source</a>). We’ll start with the side deck and my reasons for playing them before going over the main-deck tech cards in the same fashion. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Nibiru, the Primal Being x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>We begin our look at the side deck with </span></span><span><span>the format staple Nibiru, </span></span><span><span>the bane of combo decks everywhere. Now rarely alone is this enough to stop tier-one combo decks like Dragonlink or Infernoble but you need to understand this card in terms of its place among other disruption. I board this in going second in hopes of drawing it with another powerful handtrap like Gamma </span></span><span><span>which can be enough to buy me a turn to set up my </span></span><span><span>more recursive</span></span><span><span> negates. This happens about </span></span><span><span><b>10% </b></span></span><span><span>of the time so I wouldn't count on it if you're expecting a higher density of Dragonlink than I was. </span></span><span><span>Against anything under tier three or so Nibiru is absolutely devastating even by itself as most decks</span></span> <span><span>don’t have enough extenders to continue their combo or setup. </span></span><span><span>I ended up resolving this way more in practise than I did in the tourn</span></span><span><span>ament</span></span><span><span>. I’d chalk that up to the density of rogue decks in my practise environment as opposed to any of my </span></span><span><span>match-ups</span></span><span><span> being Nibiru-proof or something. If you expect a high density of </span></span><span><span>Dino</span></span><span><span>saur</span></span><span><span> or Infernoble</span></span><span><span> I’d take this out in favour of mass removal, but for most general </span></span><span><span>match-ups</span></span><span><span> this is a good pick at three. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Droll &amp; Lock Bird x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>On to Droll &amp; Lock </span></span><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>ird, a necessity against many of the same decks mentioned above. </span></span><span><span>Droll has a storied history in various decks, most notably Trickstar with the dreaded Droll loop. </span></span><span><span>Today we play </span></span><span><span>Droll &amp; Lock </span></span><span><span>B</span></span><span><span>ird</span></span><span><span> for much the same reason we play Nibiru: to fade Dragonlink and Infernoble going second, and to crush rogue-tier decks like Numeron variants and Adamancipator before they can build powerful boards. It can come in clutch in the mirror as well </span></span><span><span>due to how many opportunities you have to activate it</span></span> <span><span>such as Nadir Servant or Magical Meltdown. </span></span><span><span>As with all of the handtraps I play at three you have a</span></span><span><span><b> 33%</b></span></span><span><span> chance to open a single copy of this, so I wouldn’t cut down on them if you value being able to play against meta. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Effect Veiler x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>This will be the first of a few bad calls I made going into the tournament that I’m going to discuss in this guide. Effect Veiler is a solid handtrap in a vacuum due to it essentially being three more copies of Impermanence. In addition it has a fantastic typing for the Selene combos that many decks are using to summon Accesscode Talker. I chose to side Effect Veiler because I was expecting to see a lot more Mekk-Knight Girsu and other Aleisters than I ended up seeing. Due to my match-ups this ended up being a waste of space as I didn’t run into any of the decks I was expecting beyond the stray Dogmatika variant. I’ll go over why Impermanence was useful below but for now I would suggest switching this for some back-row hate like Cosmic Cyclone or Twin Twisters. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Lightning Storm x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Unlike the above choice this ended up being incredibly useful. I sided Lightning Storm against every non-meta deck I faced to simply disgusting results. One game my opponent managed to resolve three copies of Evenly Matched against me going first; I won a turn after I resolved Lightning Storm for a plus-three. In terms of why this works so well right now I’d point to its use as a must-negate to draw out the ever present Herald and Savage Dragon along with the lack of Solemns outside of niche control decks and Eldlich. Lightning Storm is even better in conjunction with any form of mass negates like Forbidden Droplet or the option I sided, Dark Ruler No More. I would recommend playing this with one of those options as I think it doesn't do enough on its own this format against meta. All said I continue to run three of these in my side and I’d suggest you do the same. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Dark Ruler No More x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Next up </span></span><span><span>is </span></span><span><span>our answer to the powerful Dragoon boards that filled out some </span></span><span><span><b>57% </b></span></span><span><span>of all decks in the tourn</span></span><span><span>ament</span></span><span><span>. I’ve never enjoyed needing to side in Dark Ruler </span></span><span><span>No More</span></span><span><span> as it’s not the most interactive, but this meta necessitates it. In </span></span><span><span>c</span></span><span><span>onjunction with the a</span></span><span><span>fore</span></span><span><span>mentioned Lightning Storm it can clear almost anything; </span></span><span><span>its also consistent </span></span><span><span>at about a</span></span><span><span><b> 1</b></span></span><span><span><b>4</b></span></span><span><span><b>%</b></span></span> <span><span>chance </span></span><span><span>to see them both together </span></span><span><span>going second. Now admittedly in my updated build I’ve switched this for Forbidden Droplet as I think it’s slightly better due to its discard effect stopping a wi</span></span><span><span>d</span></span><span><span>er range of interruptions. Either option could be good here depending on the specific meta you’r</span></span><span><span>e</span></span><span><span> expecting so I’d recommend testing both before taking this out. </span></span>  <span><span><b>PSY-Framegear Gamma x 3 and PSY-Frame Driver x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>We’re done looking at the side so onto the main-deck hand-traps and techs now, starting with the PSY-Frames. I’ve grouped them together as you’re never playing one without the other. Gamma is probably the most impactful hand</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>rap of modern YuGiOh due to its powerful monster-effect negate and summoning condition preventing </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span>s. The negate is so powerful due to its ability to hit any monster effect no mat</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>er where it’s activated, including most other handtraps. We main-deck the Gamma package because of its versatility </span></span><span><span>and ability to hit everything in the meta, as like with the rest of our three-ofs we have a</span></span><span><span><b> 33%</b></span></span><span><span> to open it going second. The one down side to Gamma is the need to play an extra Garnet in the form of Driver and of course Gamma itself can be a soft Garnet going first. None of the downsides outweigh the vast positives in my opinion so I’d keep this in the main deck for the foreseeable future. If you really don’t like Gamma you could always main Nibiru instead, but it didn’t preform as well in my testing.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>On to another bad call now, Ash Blossom was not worth main-decking in this event. I think that like Effect Veiler, Ash Blossom is good in a vacuum, but in the current meta I found myself siding in Droll &amp; Lock Bird for Ash Blossom going second every time. I’ve subsequently switched Ash Blossom for Droll &amp; Lock Bird in my latest build — if you intend to to play in this meta I’d recommend you do the same. Ash Blossom could be good in the side deck against certain match-ups like Gren Maju or anything that plays Pot of Desires or Pot of Extravagance but I didn’t see enough of that to justify it. One thing to note about Ash Blossom is that it can be used with Invocation to summon a follow-up Purgatrio due to its convenient attribute. Overall I wouldn’t count on Ash Blossom right now, but if you’re really attached to it or on a budget, it’ll do. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Infinite Impermanence x 3</b></span></span>  <span><span>Now onto the last handtrap I chose to main: Infinite Impermanence. You’re probably familiar with Impermanence from the last few metas and Altergeist specifically. We play it here to use with our PSY-Framegear Gamma, Droll &amp; Lock Bird, or Nibiru to have a chance going second versus tier one of the meta. It’s especially useful due to it being a trap, as if we draw it going second (<b>40%</b> or so) we can use it with Mechaba to negate our opponent’s Dogmatika Punishment or Impermanence. This can also be a valid reason to keep it in your hand going first. As with a large portion of our handtraps Impermanence smashes non-meta strategies, often without the need for other handtraps. Overall it’s worth playing in meta events if you can afford the deck space or cost.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Dinowrestler Pankratops x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Finally onto the first and only tech choice I elected to mention in this section. </span></span><span><span>I was alerted to this tech by </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/seniorious/"">Seniorious</a><span><span> and I have to say it ended up coming in clutch several times. I would attribute this to the huge amount of Mekk-Knight that </span></span><span><span>I ended up seeing as their in-archetype negates are tied to continuous spells and traps. Pankratops’s effect hits these regardless of whos</span></span><span><span>e</span></span><span><span> turn it is and worst case you blow up a monster. I was hoping it would be an effective out to Dragoon as well and that proved to be correct as it hits </span></span><span><span>Predaplant </span></span><span><span>Verte </span></span><span><span>Anaconda</span></span><span><span> hard. Additionally we can use Pankratops in the grave to summon Magellancia for help with the </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> on the follow-up. This tech worked fantastically against several decks </span></span><span><span>and</span></span><span><span> I would advise keeping this in for the foreseeable future. </span></span>  <span><span><u><b>Extra Deck</b></u></span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Elysium x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>We s</span></span><span><span>tart our look at the extra deck with another of my bad calls: Invoked Elysium. Unlike many of the others this was a bad call with some data to back it up. </span></span><span><span>Elysium tested well against Dragonlink specifically as </span></span><span><span>in</span></span><span><span><b> 66%</b></span></span><span><span> of the</span></span><span><span> games it was summoned </span></span><span><span>i</span></span><span><span>t</span></span> <span><span>ended within three turns in my favour. This may not be directly because of Elysium </span></span><span><span>due to variable skill in my practise environment, but I digress.</span></span><span><span> I took it at face value and brought Elysium in favour of</span></span> <span><span>a third N’Tss or Invoked Raidjin for summoning with spent Droll &amp; Lock </span></span><span><span>Birds. </span></span><span><span>In retrospect either of those would have been better choices as I saw maybe one Dragonlink player the whole day. For future builds I’m experimenting with some new tech to hit the increase in Dogmatika builds but a third N’Tss is probably just as good. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Mechaba x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>O</span></span><span><span>ne of the best cards in the extra, Invoked Mechaba is at the centre of most of our first-turn boards. </span></span><span><span>If you’re unfamiliar, Mechaba can negate and banish </span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span> card providing you discard a card of the same type. This can be tremendously useful </span></span><span><span>in conjunction with our Dogmatika package as it gives us access additional negates as well as consistent access to traps and monsters to fuel Mechaba’s effect. Aside from that primary use, Mechaba has the secondary use of being materi</span></span><span><span>a</span></span><span><span>l for follow-up Augoeides play</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> when needed. </span></span><span><span>I don’t think there’s any reason to run three Mechaba but one might be fine if you don’t value the </span></span><span><span>Augoeides </span></span><span><span>follow-up as much.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Magellancia x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>The f</span></span><span><span>inal tech from </span></span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/seniorious/"">Seniorious</a> <span><span>and a follow-up to the Pankratops mentioned above, Invoked Magellancia is here to assist with the </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> line from hands where we draw Pankratops. It can be useful with Punishment on occasion if you need to hit a 3</span></span><span><span>000-attack</span></span><span><span> threat like </span></span><span><span>Nibiru or Bo</span></span><span><span>r</span></span><span><span>relsword </span></span><span><span>Dragon</span></span><span><span>. If you’d prefer not to run Pankratops then this is obviously not worth it; </span></span><span><span>in that case </span></span><span><span>I’d recommend running Invoked Raidjin for synergy with main-deck Droll &amp; Lock Bird </span></span><span><span>instead.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Titaniklad the Ash Dragon x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>Enter the last piece of our Dogmatika engine: Titaniklad the Ash Dragon. This is played exclusively to send off of our Dogmatika Punishment or Nadir Servant to maintain our tempo and board presence. We can use its graveyard effect to special summon or add to hand any Dogmatika monster from our deck at the end of the turn we sent it to the grave. This is most useful for getting a main-deck follow-up on the turns you’re locked out of the extra by Punishment. You normally want to do this by special summoning Ecclesia during your opponent’s end phase and using her effect to search either another Punishment or Fleurdelis. Punishment is good for stalling your opponent’s plays for a turn if you don’t have the card advantage to close out the game. Fleurdelis is useful for clearing extra-deck threats and closing out games with its attack-boosting effect. There is some debate around how many of these is optimal; personally I settled on two because I was anticipating longer matches. I’ve gone into detail about how that turned out above but suffice it to say if you’re expecting quicker games, I’d cut this down to one. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Augoeides x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>One of our last Invoked extra-deck monsters, Invoked Augoeides is a powerful and unexpected threat. </span></span><span><span>It’s an excellent way to punish your opponent on the follow-up for destroying your first-turn Mechaba. Aside from that it’s also a pop when your opponent special summons which can be very hard for some decks such as Salamangreat or other Dogmatika to out cleanly. Augoeides is also a fantastic </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span> enabler due to its attack-boosting effect as you’re likely to have at least a</span></span><span><span>n</span></span><span><span> N’Tss or Titaniklad in grave </span></span><span><span>on </span></span><span><span>turn one. </span></span><span><span>This translates to an Augoeides with at least 4400 a</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>t</span></span><span><span>ac</span></span><span><span>k, plus potentially a Purgatrio or Magellancia on the follow-up for a total of at least 7000 damage on board turn three. </span></span><span><span>Personally I like running one of these but if you’d like to go heavier on the Dogmatika synergy you could replace this with an extra N’Tss or Wind Pegasus if you'd prefer. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Invoked Purgatrio x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>On to our final Invoked monster and OTK enabler: Invoked Purgatrio. Regardless of what client you play on you’re probably familiar with Purgatrio as it has been consistently popular since its release in both Duel Links and the TCG. It’s easy to get out thanks to our first-turn Aleister line with Almiraj on the follow-up, where its multi-attack effect and piercing damage are most relevant. Judicious use of Purgatrio on the follow-up is our answer to decks like Guru and their irritating walls, as the innate attack boost plus Aleister’s hand effect is enough to get over a boosted Guru for big damage. I wouldn’t run any less than one of these but more is probably a waste of extra deck space.</span></span>  <span><span><b>Fossil Warrior Skull Knight x 1 </b></span></span>  <span><span>Done with the fusions we actually aim to summon, we can continue with Fossil Warrior Skull Knight. Despite the obvious synergy a lot of people seem to be surprised to see this one. For the unenlightened we run Skull Knight for his graveyard effect: if we remove him from play we can target and pop an opponent’s monster. Now you might be asking why we’d play this over a third N’Tss since they do basically the same thing, right? Well, not exactly. You see, sometimes we want to pop an opponent’s monster without telegraphing N’Tss. To this end we use Skull Knight to send off of Punishment to pop on the following turn. This can be hard to deal with without a Towers or Called By The Grave specifically as almost no one is on Ghost Belle in this format. Overall this is a good option right now as some decks are starting to expect N’Tss, but you could just play another N’Tss if you wanted. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Elder Entity N’Tss x 2</b></span></span>  <span><span>I’ve mentioned N’Tss many times at this point as has all other Dogmatika coverage </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> it might as well be a part of the archetype. </span></span><span><span>On the most basic level N’Tss allows us to double Punishment’s pop, turn Nadir into a pop, or turn Maximus into two pops. </span></span><span><span>This is so well known that even non-Dogmatika decks are playing her as a way to punish the rise in Maximus. Despite how telegraphed it is, this will still catch less experienced players off guard so I’d advi</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>e caution when firing off Maximus. Overall there’s not a ton to say about N’Tss that hasn’t already been said; I’d advise playing between two and three in </span></span><span><span>this build</span></span><span><span> and potentially one to two in anything else </span></span><span><span>with the space</span></span><span><span>.</span></span>  <span><span><b>PSY-Framelord Omega x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Second-to-last Punishment target now and a key piece in our grind-game, Omega is a well-known tool for recycling banished cards to the point that it finds itself on the </span></span><span><span>L</span></span><span><span>imited list. We use it here for just that, recycling our </span></span><span><span>resources like N’Tss or Punishment while still keeping any remaining </span></span><span><span>F</span></span><span><span>oolish effects live. I’ve tested the deck without Omega but I would recommend against this as any games going past turn four start to </span></span><span><span>put significant strain on your extra deck resources. If you’d like to do without Omega I would perhaps recommend playing Cyber Dragon Nova as a way to cheat out your second Mechaba to close out games faster against Dogmatika, as they tend to be our grindiest match-up. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Wind Pegasus @Ignister x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>At last we arrive at our last Punishment target and only non-destruction removal aside from Super Polymerization in this build. Wind Pegasus @Ignister is powerful in much the same way N’Tss is, although slightly more restricted due to its effect triggering when a card is destroyed. The benefit over N’Tss is that Wind Pegasus shuffles a card back into the deck. Now this does target so regrettably it won’t hit Dragoon and the like, but it’s very much worth playing right now due to the popularity of Dinosaur and Infernoble. I’ve experimented with two of these in favour of a third N’Tss and it shows promise as out of the six games played with that build specifically, four of them resolved at least one Pegasus by turn three and two by turn five (providing the game lasted that long). I think that might be worth some more testing in the future, and you can bet that if I make a follow-up to this guide I’ll be sure to have a more definitive answer then. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Secure Gardna x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>Finally we can look at the deck’s small array of links, starting with Secure Gardna. Gardna is mostly here to link off Aleister by way of Almiraj to get a </span></span><span><span>L</span></span><span><span>ight on field and Aleister in the grave. This is an incredibly consistent opening as almost </span></span><span><span><b>70% </b></span></span><span><span>of hands can accomplish this line. Aside from that Gardna doesn’t see much use outside of matches against Mystic Mine decks. In one such game I used Gardna to totally negate the effect of their burn win-con</span></span><span><span>dition</span></span><span><span> long enough for me to draw my Harpie’s Feather Duster, after which the game swiftly ended. I would advise against playing more or less of this as one seems to be optimal in my testing. </span></span>  <span><span><b>Salamangreat Almiraj x 1</b></span></span>  <span><span>L</span></span><span><span>ast extra-deck card now, and final piece of the above-mentioned line with Gardna. Salamangreat Almiraj is played here simply to get our Aleister and itself in grave for the summon of Mechaba turn one and Purgatrio on the following turn. Its effect comes up rarely as a way to keep a Fleurdelis or </span></span><span><span>Magellancia</span></span><span><span> alive </span></span><span><span>to assist with lethal in situations where you have the chance to special </span></span><span><span>summon</span></span><span><span> it with it</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span> owns effect. Aside from that I have little to say about this card, like above don’t </span></span><span><span>play any less if you value the consistent opening play. </span></span>  <span><span><b>3. Combo Guide</b></span></span>  <span><span>Before I begin going over the hands I’ve picked out I’d like to go over who this section is for. Simply put, if you’re a more experienced player I’d recommend skipping this as I’m writing it for those who are new to the deck. I’ll be going over three types of hands that make up<b> </b><b>87%</b> of all hands the deck produces. If you’d like a more in-depth combo guide versus meta, I’ll be posting an addendum to The Yu-Gi-Oh Writers Guild (see Final Thoughts). </span></span>  <span><span><b>1) Aleister the Invoker </b></span></span>  <span><span>The first hand </span></span><span><span>I’ll be covering is any hand with access to just Aleister. This can be through Meltdown or Terraforming so remember to resolve those first if needed. We start by normal summoning Aleister and using his effect to search Invocation before linking him off for Almiraj. From Almiraj we link summon Secure Gardna to get ourselves access to a </span></span><span><span>L</span></span><span><span>ight monster for summoning Mechaba with Invocation. Next we do just that before ending on Mechaba and any traps you drew. This leaves us with an omni-negate at minimum plus an average of one handtrap and/or one trap card (</span></span><span><span><b>66%</b></span></span><span><span> of hands draw Aleister plus a trap or handtrap,</span></span><span><span><b> 20%</b></span></span><span><span> draw Aleister plus one of each). From here you should have </span></span><span><span>enough negates to stall your opponent’s strategy long enough to finish them on the follow-up. Said follow-up is normally </span></span><span><span>accomplished by</span></span><span><span> summoning Purgatrio with the Aleister we add back off of Invocation’s grave effect </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> providing they didn’t manage to out our Mechaba </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> for some 6000 </span></span><span><span>or so</span></span><span><span> damage on board with piercing. </span></span><span><span>If they outed our Mechaba, Augoeides is a better follow-up as its on-summon effect allows us to stall our opponent for longer while pushing for damage with its at</span></span><span><span>tac</span></span><span><span>k</span></span><span><span>-</span></span><span><span>boosting effect. From this position the game should be over </span></span><span><span>shortly depending on your opponent and their draws. </span></span>  <span><span><b>2) Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous</b></span></span>  <span><span>Next up is Ecclesia, normally an extender, but there will be hands without Aleister where this is your best normal summon. Ecclesia can be special summoned providing there is a monster summoned from the extra deck on the field, and on summon she searches any Dogmatika card. The most common targets for this are Punishment, Fleurdelis, or Maximus on occasion. As an aside I would caution using Maximus on the first turn against unknown decks as many strategies are either running picks to punish us generally or running N’Tss and Punishment sincerely as an engine. Aside from that, most of the time you’ll want to search Punishment providing you didn’t draw it for the potential two pops it provides. This will leave you with at least Punishment plus a<b> 40% </b>chance of a handtrap in your opener to get you through your opponent’s turn. This is obviously not as good as the above mentioned Aleister line but its important to remember we are aiming to open and resolve both lines simultaneously. Hopefully this gives you an idea of what to do if you don’t open the full combo. </span></span>  <span><span><b>3) Aleister + Ecclesia </b></span></span>  <span><span>Our final hand to go over is the deck’s best hand and standard opener in the cases we draw it. </span></span><span><span>We have a</span></span><span><span><b> 35%</b></span></span><span><span> to open this hand </span></span><span><span>which is not bad for the number of negates it puts up.</span></span><span><span> To get started you want to be opening some form of Aleister and Ecclesia, </span></span><span><span>although if you didn’t open Ecclesia herself be careful not to activate Nadir Servant before fusion summoning. Speaking of which, your first step to resolving this hand is </span></span><span><span>the same as the first hand we covered. Normal summon Aleister, link into Almiraj and Gardna ,then use Invocation to summon Mechaba with Gardna and Aleister in grave before adding back Aleister with Invocation’s graveyard effect. </span></span><span><span>From here we</span></span> <span><span>can execute our Dogmatika plays starting with getting Ecclesia on the field by her own effect. As a note if you’re resolving Nadir Servant to search Ecclesia at this point I’d advise sending Titaniklad to add Fleurdelis to your hand at end step for the effect negate. That aside, we search Punishment of off Ecclesia to add an additional two pops to the omni-negate and potential effect-negate we already covered. </span></span><span><span>The follow-up from this point is similar to the first hand we covered in that we want to summon either Purgatrio or Augoeides </span></span><span><span>for a swift </span></span><span><span>OTK</span></span><span><span>. This is assisted by Fleurdelis who you’ve either summoned on your opponent’s turn or are summoning by its own effect as a follow-up. All told if you get everything on board that I’ve mentioned you’ll have some 9500 damage </span></span><span><span>to finish off your opponent and hopefully the game soon after. </span></span>  <span><span><b>4. Final Thoughts</b></span></span>  <span><span>At last we reach the end of this deck guide! I’m really grateful to anyone who read this far. Let me know if you like this list or if you have suggestions or questions down below. I’d also like to take a second before wrapping up to plug The Yu-Gi-Oh Writers Guild Discord server of which I am the Guild Master. If you enjoy writing any sort of Yu-Gi-Oh guides, fanfics, or other such projects why not check us out? We’re an open and accepting group that help and encourage each other to produce the best work possible. If you’d be interested in joining feel free to PM me here or comment down below. We hope to see you there soon.</span></span>  <span><span>Before I finish this I’d just like to go over my final thoughts on the deck and its future. </span></span><span><span>Overall I was very impressed with the performance of the deck, despite the hostility of the current meta. The gap between tie</span></span><span><span>r-</span></span><span><span>one decks and all other viable strategies is staggering, but despite being tier two at best Invoked Dogmatika managed to steal wins from the best of them. Both of my losses were the result of getting out-tempoed in game three by grindier decks like Eldlich </span></span><span><span>—</span></span><span><span> for your sake I’d recommend changing up the side-deck to avoid this. As far as the future of the archetypes involved go I’d say that </span></span><span><span>Invoked will continue to be meta for as long as it goes un-hit on the banlist. </span></span><span><span>D</span></span><span><span>espite being three years old at this point, Aleister is still one of the best normal summons in the game </span></span><span><span>and Mechaba’s negate will continue to be relevant regardless due to it banishing. As far as Dogmatika goes Konami seems to revealing more and more </span></span><span><span>indirect </span></span><span><span>support for it as time goes by. With the release of </span></span><span><span>Brigand the Glory Dragon next month </span></span><span><span>and Splind the Steelexpress Dragon sometime next year we</span></span><span><span>’ll soon be able to jam Dogmatika </span></span><span><span>with Tri-Brigade </span></span><span><span>and Sprigguns.</span></span><span><span> I’ve not tested </span></span><span><span>either</span></span><span><span> myself but the results look promising. </span></span><span><span>Until next time</span></span><span><span>, stay safe </span></span><span><span>duellists</span></span><span><span>!</span></span>"

This deck is very consistent and is easily the best deck of the metagame right now. Adding Dragonmaids to this deck is one of its upsides, chamber and parlor dragonmaid can easily use their effects to get 2 dragons to the field aka Romulus (full combo). </span>  &nbsp;  <span>I explain the deck and the COMBO, which results in 1 hand rip, 1 extra deck rip, banishing the top card of your opponents deck, having a true king of all calamities on the field (free win) and apollusa with 3 negates - all with just one of the 15 starters in the deck (dark ruler doesn't save the opponent as well) on my youtube video, please subscribe to my channel and like the video it is a great way to support me and the channel. If you are interested in looking at my last 2 videos I will leave the link to them here as well</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to my Shunping Xu Inspired Dragon link deck and combo video - </span>  <a><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K_3kQjLLqQ</span></a>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to my NIBIRU PROOF Infernoble knight combo video - </span><a><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGx6sROpxmw</span></a>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to my Tier 1 Zoodiac ft.

You will see a starter at hand approximately 1 in every 4 cards. The starters include 3x black metal dragon, 3x Starliege sefert, 3x chaos space, 3x parlor dragonmaid and 3x chamber dragonmaid. If for some reason you do not draw one of your starters getting 2 dragons on the field will work as well.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Handtraps - 15</span></td> <td><span>You are playing 15 handtraps as well to interrupt your opponent as much as possible so that they cannot combo off. You are playing the high impact handtraps like droll and nibiru for this reason and playing gamma to ensure your combos goes off (sefert tribute itself, chaos space etc). Handtrap lineup is your choice, you can mix things up the way you like but you should definitely keep droll, nibiru and gamma - they are the most high impact handtraps in the game.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Extenders - 22</span></td> <td><span>You need extenders to extend your own combo if you get handtrapped - no explanation needed here.</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span>Bricks - 4 </span>  <span>Special case bricks - 4</span></td> <td><span>There are 8 cards in this deck that you don’t usually want to draw but that does not mean ALL of them are bricks. Half of them are bricks, like PSY driver and Dragomaid tidying but the others are not always bricks and can sometimes be useful for example - rokket recharger can be sent to the GY for its effect, It better that having a silver rokket at hand and it's not completely useless and red rose dragon can be used to extend the combo if you draw it (One of Shunping Xu’s genius plays). </span><b>I explain that down below</b></td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp;  <b>Combo: To prove Red rose is not always a brick</b>  <b>Cards needed</b><span>: Any starter + any extender + red rose (I will use parlor dragonmaid and noctovision dragon for this but it can be any of them)</span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li><span>Normal summon Parlor dragonmaid </span></li>  	<li><span>Eff.

(2) - special summon red rose dragon from hand</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>That’s basically the setup for red rose dragon, you can do the combo from here and you already have a tuner on the field (that is not tracer) without having to use halqifibrax! This means you can even get a full combo (more or less) if your halq gets handtrapped. Watch my video to see how to do the best case scenario combo, Link down below!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Just a final reminder that I explain the deck and the combos in-depth in my video (combo results in - 1 hand rip, 1 extra deck rip, banishing the top card of your opponents deck, having a true king of all calamities on the field (free win) and apollusa with 3 negates - all with just one of the 15 starters in the deck - dark ruler doesn't save the opponent because of VFD).

So this is my first decklist so I am kinda new to this but I hope you guys enjoy this list!  So the deck is obviously Fortune Ladies, the idea behind this deck is to draw as many cards as possible to get the resources to summon a bunch of level 7 synchros. I tried to make the deck focus on summoning Fortune Lady Water and Fortune Lady Past ( Past cuz she's the tuner, and Water for her draw 2 effects). I use monsters like Light to help supplement the strategy and Dark to help recycle resources. The main spell that you are going to wanna see are Fortune Visions, Fortune Lady Calling, and Future Visions. Fortune Visions is great because it lets you search any card that has Fortune Lady in its name (This includes the spells and traps). Fortune Lady Calling special summons a fortune lady from your deck as long as it doesn't share a name of any other fortune ladies that you control (Keep this in mind if you already control a Water your gonna wanna get rid of that one before you can summon a new one from this spell), also this card does lock you into synchros. Future Visions is just a great spell card that stuns really hard! Also it can help activate Fortune Ladies effects like Light for example. So finally the Synchro you gonna wanna summon is Fortune Lady Every, Fortune Ladies new Boss monster, she not only has a self revival effect from the GY but also whenever she gains a level during the standby phase you can banish a face-up monster your opponent controls. To help with some spot removal I am using other levels 7 synchros like Arcanite magician, and interruption monsters like Clear Wing Synchro Dragon.  Anyway sorry if this description is kinda long-winded I am still super new to this, but in the end, thank you all for checking out my deck!"

Fur Hires can go 1st or 2nd and the end board slightly changes based on who's going first (Personally I think the deck shines going 2nd). If you are going 1st you want to summon Folgo as fast as you can then use his effect to play Filo so you can continue to special summon and to keep building up your board, and usually end on Folgo, Rafale, Wiz, and Linkuriboh so you have a monster effect negate and a spell/ trap negate and a way to weaken your opponent's monsters during battle. Going second your gonna wanna use Folgo and Filo again to build up your board and using different destruction effects  (i.e. cards like Raigeki, Donpa, and Recon) that way your opponent is open for attacks then you should end with Rafale, Folgo, and Saryuja (or one of the Borrels as well if you want a monster with protection instead). I know that Fur Hires are not the best deck but it has a really cool aesthetic and playstyle that I think with the right support can actually compete with some of the more competitive deck. Anyway, with that, I hope you guys like this decklist, and I am planning on posting more soon! ^^"

Access R4NK or R8NK toolbox with your mass machinery and overwhelm your opponent! GOG","<em><strong>Deck Summary!~</strong></em>  This budget Gadget deck designed to primarily go second that utilizes the R4NK/R8NK toolbox to overwhelm and quickly OTK your opponent using gadgets and extenders.  While sub-optimal going first, this deck can still set up Bagooska/Time Thief (R4NK) and Number 38 (R8NK) for interruptions with 6 handtraps. This deck is better suited going second, breaking the board with the kaiju package (or if you're rich, Lightning Storm/Forbidden Droplet/Evenly Matched), and swinging for 10K damage with the utopia package. If the opponent is still standing after such an assault, Divine Arsenal can be overlayed on top of Utopia during main phase 2 for a board wipe during the opponent's turn.  <em><strong>Card Breakdown!~</strong></em>  <strong>The Gadgets</strong> are the main stars of this deck, allowing summon spam of rank 4s very quickly. Gold/Silver summon more 4 star machines and float into other gadgets. Resources are added to hand with the summons of Red, Yellow, and Green Gadgets.  This deck has three <strong>extenders</strong> - are Infinitrack Anchor Drill, also allowing rank 8s to be made (using it's effect) when summoned with another level 4 machine. Parallel Exceed can be special summoned for free from the hand when Platinum Gadget is link summoned, summoning another copy of itself from deck for a free rank 4. Boot-Up Corporal is another free 4 star machine given there are gadgets in the field/graveyard.  To break your opponent's board going second, the <strong>Kaiju Package</strong> is my budget friendly option. Kaijus tribute your opponent's problematic monsters away (like Dragoon or Borreload Savage), and can also wipe the board clean with Interrupted Kaiju slumber. Kaijus can then be dealt with your rank 4 toolbox, as they are only big beaters and have no inherent protection. If you have deep pockets and can afford Lightning Storm, Forbidden Droplet or Evenly Matched, I suggest using them in place of the handtraps/kaiju package in this deck for a more effective going second style. Dark Ruler No More is also a sidedeck option for board breaking too, I just don't like it because OTKs cannot be performed the turn it was used.  The <strong>handtraps</strong> of choice are Ash Blossom and PSY-Framegear Gamma in an effort to slow down your opponent before they can build a big board. Ash Blossom is currently expensive, so it can be switched out to Effect Veiler to drastically reduce this deck's price. Ghost Ogre/Droll/Impermance can also be used, depending on the match-up.  <strong>Divine Arsenal - Sky Thunder</strong> has not been released yet (as of the creation of this deck profile), and it will likely be incredibly expensive. Budget players, keep in mind that this card is optional and it isn't overly crucial to this deck's strategy.  <em><strong>Game Plan!~</strong></em>  After doing all we can slowing our opponent down with handtraps and breaking their board, we try to summon as many gadgets as possible along with our extenders Anchor Drill/Boot-Up Corporal -&gt; link summon Platinum Gadget -&gt; Special summon another machine to Platinum Gadget's zone/Special Summon Parallel Exceed to Platinum Gadget's zone -&gt; XYZ summon to our monster of choice using our R4NK or R8NK toolbox. Usually we try to swing for 10k into our opponent's monster/kaiju with the Utopia package. If the opponent is still standing after such an assault, Divine Arsenal can be overlayed on top of Utopia during main phase 2 for a board wipe during the opponent's turn.  <strong>Conclusion!~</strong>  Without the expensive cards of Ash Blossom and Divine Arsenal - Sky Thunder, this deck can be bought for about $50 USD!  This deck does a good at it's job of achieving it's purpose, board-breaking into an OTK, however, it falls to handtraps and has little to no grindgame. It is sub-optimal going first. This deck is one-dimensional, it's moves are highly telegraphed and can be dealt with accordingly by a prepared opponent. Overall, this deck is meant to be a weaker rogue/casual deck. However, this deck can still steal wins from the meta big boys and with that being said - GOGO POWER GADGETS!~"

The main issue of this deck is the inability to fit handtraps.  The strategy depends on the opening hand. Most times, however, you will be going second, using Eldlich to dump him in the GY. Then, use his second effect to SS himself or another important zombie monster. Now, it is possible to Normal Summon a zombie monster to get your plays going, such as Hajun. Use Hajun to begin climbing to either The Skeletal Synchro, or the Link-4 Yuki.  The only way to disrupt your opponent is through Doomking and Link-4 Yuki.  Monsters:  3 Eldlich: Removes stuff from the field and allows us to play through at least one disruption most time. He is a starter.  1 Doomking: Revives himself and allows us to disrupt our opponent. Can run 2, if needed.  2 Necroworld Banshee: Can run at 1, I like her at 2 because she makes for really cheesy Doomking banish by chaining Doomking to her effect.  3 Uni-zombie: Allows the GY to get filled with zombies easily. Starter.  2 Dakki: Synergizes really well with Hajun, Doomking, and Link-4 Yuki. Run 2 because if she gets banished, the entire Mayakashi portion of the deck is no longer usable except for Yuki-Musume.  3 Hajun: Powerhouse starter, but also get ashed, veilered, and ogred easily. Run 3 because he is a great card to have in hand because he activates when Normal or Special Summoned.  1 Yuki-Musume: Amazing card, but if she gets banished, it is not the end of the world. Is a Foolish Burial in monster form.  1 Glow-Up Bloom: Do not want to draw him. He is an easy way to summon Doomking. Can replace a Link-4 Yuki in Extra Deck for a Linkuriboh for this guy.  Spells:  3 Mayakashi Return: Allows use to get any Mayakashi card to our hand or GY. Great card.  3 Eldlixir of Black Awakening: Easy Eldlich summon, or if Eldlich is already on board, allows for easy summon of any zombie.  3 Eldlixir of White Destiny: Easy Eldlich, or if Eldlich is already on board, allows for easy summon of GY Mayakashi Synchros to activate their effects. Can Run 2-3.  1 Foolish Burial: Can be used to dump Yuki-Musume, Necroworld Banshee, Eldlich, or Glow-Up Bloom.  3 Cursed Eldland: Easy way to get Eldlich in hand. Also allows us to get our ""Golden Land"" Traps easily.  3 Zombie World: Allows for Doomking to pop off, also floodgates some deck.  Traps:  3 Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine: Easy way to summon Eldlich, or if he is already on board, any other zombie. Also allows us to get our ""Golden Land"" Traps easily.  3 Conquistador of the Golden Land: With Eldlich on board, this guy is good non-target destruction and a body for Link Summons. Also, allows us to get those Eldlixir cards easily.  2 Huaquero of the Golden Land: Great way to rip apart opponents GY. Also, allows us to get the ""Eldlixir"" cards easily.  Extra Deck:  2 Of Each Mayakashi Synchro: Can run 1 of each if you really wanted to, or can run 1 of certain ones to make space for Linkuriboh.  2 Link-4 Yuki: Great card, negate field monster effect, and sets their ATK to 0. Fairly easy to get out. Synergizes well with Dakki. Also, negates the effects of banished monsters, which is very niche, but is great when it works.  1 Link-2 Yuki: Bad card, but makes for an easy way to get the Link-4 Yuki.  1 Vampire Sucker: Works great with Doomking, Eldlich, Yuki-Musume. Be careful though, Main Deck Mayakashis lock you out of non-Mayakashi Extra Deck.  1 Avendread Savior: Great at dumping cards to the GY. The same warning applies to this guy.  Side Deck:  1 One for One: Used to be in the deck, was replaced with Dakki but can be put back if needed.  3 Guardian of the Golden Land: This card is mainly used against Dragoon after Dragoon has already negated something. Is non-targeted ATK removal. This allows us to run over Dragoon with any non-0 ATK monster.  2 Golden Land Forever: Could make for good negate if needed.  1 Huaquero of the Golden Land: If the opponent relies on their GY heavily, this card is very useful."

I fixed Nordics. *deck begins to leak as all the duct tape starts to fall apart*,"<span>It's hard to do create a ""viable"" Nordic deck, isn't it? There are many issues plaguing the archetype and the most recent support actually hinders the archetype from making any play other than ""Summon Gullveig, banish cards go brrrrrr-"" and end up as Rata would put it, a ""boring, linear, defend the castle strategy"". On top of that is Alviss specific ""banish only this card"" clause combined with Gullveig's ""can't special summon other monsters other than Aesir"" clause creating one of the most suffocatingly specific summoning restrictions because it was the link era and Konami was too afraid that people could realistically summon more than one Aesir god at a time despite each God having such underwhelming and outdated effects for the amount of resources need to summon them. Bleh.</span>  <span>Now some of you may think that it sounds like I don't like the archetype but it is actually one of my most thematically favorite and something I played often back when synchro's were just becoming a thing.  </span>  <span>But enough talk, what is the strategy in this deck? Well it's pretty much a worse Needlefiber Linkross combo deck where Plan A is to summon a tuner and another monster to get out the combo or Plan B which is the classic Nordic defend the castle strategy. The way that this deck is ratio'd however is so that you can consistently rely on getting either Plan A (any monster + tuner into link synchro shenanigans, then ending it off with Gullveig into an Aesir God and calling it a day) on the field or Plan B (single Nordic into Gullveig go brrrrrrr-). Surprisingly after testing this deck, I managed to get Plan A most of the time starting with either Rescue Cat, Righty Driver, Double Summon, Dverg + Nordic tuner, T.G. swarm, etc. pretty consistently too. And if you can't get Plan A on board, then Plan B tends to be there most of the time as well. Plan A board tends to end with a negate or two (usually herald and/or F.A.) on the board plus an Aesir God through ending it with Gullveig and if you somehow survive a second turn, you can make even more monsters depending on the resources you have on hand (Pot of Avarice, Skull Dread, T.G. Hyper Librarian are all great ways to recycle/replenish back resources). Hop Ear Squadron is also an interesting card that can be useful in hand or deck. I find it neat to summon F.A. Dawn Dragster during my opponent's turn in those rare occasions while I have Hyper Librarian on the field.</span>  <span>As for weaknesses, it's pretty self evident. The deck may survive one disruption but two or more and it is over considering the amount of hand traps and omni-negates there are these days. Realistically this deck is best when going first but going second is...well...risky to say the least. The other problem is Gullveig's arrows pointing down which means your Aesir God will not receive Gullveig's protection if you are setting up with plan A since you would need a clever method to get rid of the link from your own extra monster zone. I'm pretty sure that it is possible to make an even better combo Nordic deck but I'm pretty much out of ideas at this point. I also feel like this deck could have some great potential if it had a new wave of support. Perhaps a new Aesir God (we have a whole pantheon, cmon Konami!) or just some new monsters and card effects that focuses getting multiple Aesirs on the field?

For a tip. if your opponent plays combo focus on making Ruler then Herald. If your'e opponent plays heavy back-row focus on making zeus or Quadrantids.

Quick disclaimer: This is a combo deck, not a control variant like the one that topped  Here's a video detailing the deck if you are interested: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBofBlPBthQ</a>  STRATEGY: The deck aims to turbo out Crystron Halqifibrax, everyone's favourite card of the format through a mass of tuners and extenders. As soon as you get to halq, you will combo off as I will detail below and draw at least 5 cards while doing this (Although 3 will be put back by saryuja), not to mention the plethora of Danger!'s you run, which are basically upstart goblins on legs. This basically gurantees drawing into one of your 6 copies of Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman, and you can also simply search it with a Buster Whelp if you draw it in your opening hand. At that point you just need 1 more extender to make infinite negates, with prologue being able to set up a the buster blader lock, which is basically a one-sided bagooska. You also gurantee having a dragon buster in your GY to resolve buster dragon's 3rd effect to equip buster lock too! If you do not draw into the buster whelp, the trap will likely be private knowledge, so you can do all that after your opponent activates something like Dark Ruler No More or Forbidden Droplets. This deck can play through handtraps to some degree if you are able to open enough extenders  &nbsp;  COMBO:  Basically any way to get to halq.  1.) Halq eff summon Buster Whelp from your deck. This is usually because it has the potential to be an extender later on which is important in this deck. If you hard draw the 1 copy of Dragon Buster, summon that instead 2.) Link Halq off into Linkross 3.) Linkross eff generating tokens in order to make synchro plays 4.) 1 token + the tuner to synchro summon Formula Synchron 5.) Formula eff to draw a card 6.) Formula + another token to synchro summon Metal Marcher in any zone EXCEPT the one directly under Linkross because we'll need it 7.) MMM eff to bring back your dragon tuner 8.) Link your dragon tuner off into an Elpy 9.) Link MMM and Linkross into a Protector Whelp directly above the Elpy 10.) Protector Whelp eff to dump the Dragon Buster from your deck. If you summoned DBDS off Halq, dump a card of your liking, preferably a Buster Whelp or a Destruction Sword Memories 11.) Elpy eff summoning brotaur from your deck 12.) Brotaur eff target itself to search Levianeer 13.) Link Brotaur into a Pisty in any zone so that Elpy and Protector Whelp still point to the same zone. This will probably be the right-most zone you can summon in. 14.) Pisty eff summon back anything (It doesn't really matter) 15.) Link all 4 of your monsters into a Saryuja 16.) Saryuja eff drawing 4 cards. You are more than likely going to have access to a trap trick/prologue at this point. If you don't...... I'm sorry 17.) Summon Levianeer from your hand by banishing Formula Synchron, Linkross and Protector Whelp (3 LIGHT monsters) 18.) Levianeer eff bring back anything (It doesn't matter) 19.) Saryuja eff summon a monster from your hand 20.) Summon an extender you may have drawn (you should have 9-10 still in your deck to draw off Saryuja. You also have the ability) 21.)  Link into a Reprodocus so that it points to a monster you control 22.) Reprodocus eff change your monster into a winged-beast 23.) Reprodocus + that monster into Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty 24.) Link the remaining 2 monsters into a Union Carrier 25.) Set prologue and use Carrier's eff to equip Mist Valley Thunderbird to Simorgh 26.) Proceed to the EP and use Simorgh's eff to summon Mist Valley Apex Avian from your deck 27.) During your opponent's turn: Activate Prologue and send Destruction Sword's Memories and a Buster Blader monster to summon Buster Dragon from your extra deck. 28.) Use Memories' GY eff to banish the Buster Blader and any dragon monster (Saryuja) in order to summon the Buster Blader fusion 29.) Use Buster Dragon's effect to equip Dragon Buster to the fusion  It was a long combo, but here is the endboard: Infinite Negates (Apex Avian + Thunderbird lock), an extra deck lock (Dragon Buster Destruction Sword) and a one-sided Bagooska/Skill Drain(Buster Blader fusion + Buster Dragon)  Overall, the deck is extremely consistent as it almost never needs you to draw specific cards and simply having extenders is usually good enough. This deck can also play a decent amount of handtraps because the ones we play are all tuners so one of them + an extender equals Halqifibrax. I've had a ton of fun with this deck and I hope you do too!"

I don't collect card anymore but i still play on my switch when I have free time. I mostly play a Blue eyes deck( I know, but i like it). this is a concept deck ive hand floating in my head for a few days, combining some elements of of Seto's dragons into some that that might not fully work yet. as of writing i have not fully play tested this deck and i havent fully had time to work all the bugs out but here is the main way to play  &nbsp;  plan A is Ritual Summon with advance ritual,  either Chaos max of Chaos regular is fine but its a 3000+ on turn one. proceed to demolish what's in front. for added power and more attacks silvers cry will res the Blue eyes you sent to the grave. this will net you about 6000 + damage, downside is no real way to save your monsters is a trap or magic or effect takes them out.  &nbsp;  plan B, if all your monsters are destroyed, no worries, you still have a few options left but you will need the right cards. Maiden of blue will resummon with a good shield or chaos Emp will banish above monsters to then reclaim the duel.  &nbsp;  Plan C if you made it to this plan you are all kinds of done, but in the event you need it. i added some Fang cards to add a few back up plans.  &nbsp;  you can play any plan in any order but i highly recommend using the Ritual monsters first.  &nbsp;  that's all for now.  &nbsp;  thank you and enjoy."

","Like normal, i'm trying to mash Invokeds into something because I love Invokeds. Myutants don't work as well with Invokeds as Dragonmaids did, but they still do work fairly well. They have a few ranging attributes to use, and Invocation banishes cards, providing more banish fodder. Deck list time. 2x Arsenal- too bricky at 3. Another one of the, like, weird evolved forms that I run at 2. Pretty good in the current meta, considering how it can dodge fog blade and imperm. 2x Mist- i'm seeing a patttern here. I run all the weird evolved forms at 2. Mist gives instant advantage by banishing a card, which can easily turn into a plus 3 in the right situation. 2x Beast- Beast is solid. Can't be targeted by monster effects, which dodges Dragoon, Borreload, etc. Also negates spell cards by banishing cards, so it gathers advantage. 3x Aleister- Mandatory for the Invoked engine. Great searcher as well. 1x GB-88- Running at 1, since it's effect is awkward to special summon it. Works well with Cry though. It's also fairly good late game recovery. 3x ST-46- Reliable searcher for the Myutants, as it searches a spell/trap. If you need fusion, you can get a fusion, you can get a cry, etc. Great searcher, staple 3 of. M 3x M-05- adds a monster, which is also fairly nice, although not as great as searching a spell/trap. Reliable card tho. 3x Ash Blossom- ez negate 2x Ghost Ogre- ez destruction 1x Cyberstien- This deck doesn;t use it's normal summon a ton, so if you don't need to normal summon an Aleister at the moment, you can normal summon a Cyberstein to cheat out Ultimus. Banish/fusion fodder otherwise 3x Magical Meltdown- Easily snags you an Aleister if you don't already have one, and gives good protection. Replace it after you're done with it with Lab 3x Myutant Evolution Lab- Da archtypel field spell. Easy special summon that can free up your normal summon for Aleister or Cyber-Stein, and a small attack boost. Replace Meltdown with this after you search 3x Invocation- Da invoked fusion spell. Provides extra banish fodder as well, which is nice. 3x Myutant Fusion- Da Myutant fusion spell. Also provides banish fodder while getting out fusions. 1x Terraforming- Searches out whichever field spell you need. Nice searcher 1x Set Rotation- Can be used to make use of your Magical Meltdowns and such in the deck after you've searched, in order to stop the opponent. 3x Myutant Cry- Great for getting out Ultimus easier during the opponent's turn, also searchable by Trap Trick 3x Trap Trick- Searhces Cry to fuse Ultimus easier, and provides more banish fodder Extra deck 3x Ultimus- Strong beater and boss monster 2x Mechaba- Easy negates 3x Synthethis- Nice negate built in, generally a solid monster to ""rank up"" into Ultimus by fusing it 1x Magellanica- 3k beater for an OTK finish 2x Purgatrio- Another solid beater 2x Cocytus- Stalls for time like an asshole by summoning a wall 1x Raijin- Built in book of moon, helps to beat over problem monsters 1x Caliga- god i love floodgates Playing guide This won't be super in depth or anything. I've done a bit of play testing, and my main strategy is fairly simple.  If you don't have an Aleitser, activate Meltdown to search one. If you already have one, Meltdown is just usable for Set Rotation. If you didn't activate Meltdown, or after activating Meltdown, activate Evo lab to special summon a monster. Search Evo with terraforming if you don't already have it.  Tribute the small special summoned Myutant (the one that's in the cage) to search either a monster or a spell, while also providing more banish fodder. Afterwards, fusion summon Synthethis using Myutant Fusion, or search a Fusion using 46 if you don't already have one. After fusion summoning Synthethis, use Invocation to get out whatever Invoked fits the current moment attribute wise. Pass turn. During your opponent's turn, activate Cry and use Synthethis to get out Ultimus much easier. Note: I didn't mention it, but throughout this, you can normal summon Cyber Stein or Aleister if neccesary. Cyber Stein is fantastic for cheating out Ultimus, or if you already have Ultimus, you can use it to get out an extra Ultimus or a Synthethis. also note you'll want to go first so you can set up Cry with Trap Trick to get into Ultimus easier.

I use a lot of tech support cards for negation and the ability to counter. I get a lot of compliments on my Red Dragon Archfiend build.  I use two each of <b>Twin Twister</b> to get rid of field cards, counter traps, normal traps, and annoying continuous cards.  <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> stops opponents nuisance negation/problematic monsters so I can quickly get out Supernova Dragon and Abyss in my first turn.  <strong>Resurrection cards</strong> for bringing back my monsters that the opponent sent to the graveyard.  <strong>The only high level in my main deck:</strong>  <strong>Chaos Hunter</strong> is the best counter for stopping opponent from banishing cards. Enough said. It's hilarious against Dark Magician decks and zombies, or any build that is built around banishing or has banishing support cards.  <strong>Synchro Call</strong> helps me quickly get out Abyss or Void Ogre, or save a monster from any problematic situation.  <strong>Red Screen</strong> is just a far better version of Swords Of Revealing Light. It also helps me get out Abyss, Bane, Calamity, Nova, or Supernova.  The level four monsters:  <strong>Stygian</strong> solves an issue with being disrupted in a match where I get negated but can solve it by special summoning a monster from my hand. Another thing is that it allows me to get a second level four on the field after I have one Rising Dragon to special summon a second Rising Dragon.  <strong>Valkyria</strong> helps me special summon it while I have a <strong>Rising Dragon</strong> on the field to bring out a second Rising Dragon. Another thing, it helps me send certain monsters to the graveyard that will benefit me later on.  <strong>Wildwind</strong> helps me special summon it and allow me to get out two Rising Dragons.  &nbsp;  The strategy is to bring out <strong>Supernova Dragon</strong> and <strong>Abyss</strong>...  With, on a great hand, sometimes I am able to get out Abyss, Supernova, Void Ogre, and Bane,  or on rarer occasions, with Calamity amongst them in one turn.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><strong>Be prepared for constant rage quitters, whiners, accussers, etc!!

It's taken a minute but I believe I've finally built a formidable magnet warrior deck.  &nbsp;  First of Adamancipators are still great, by removing block dragon I couldn't put one of the best rock searches in here. But adamancipators and magnet warriors go hand in hand when it comes to searching for the monsters that you need to win the game. It only takes a matter of timewhich isnt something we always have today in the Yu-Gi-Oh world, but oh well right? I recently seen on someone else's decklist that Fossil's and Magnet Warriors work well together. The Adamancipators take care of filling up the field and Fossils use the discarded rock monsters as fusion materials to create a quick gate way to a great rock monster. Depending on which monster you'll be able to summon, you can gain some effects that'll give you the upper hand.  &nbsp;  Starting of with all four magnet warriors in your hand isn't an issue, Its actually right where I would wanna be. Magnet tip: Do not summon berserkion right away. Take your time. Use Gamma to summon Delta and send the other beta to the grave. Beta is an amazing card but its very easy to search your warriors in this deck so he's as much needed as usual. Now during your opponents turn you want to use Gamma's effect to summon another Delta from the deck in defensive position, hint hint, most of the rock monsters you summon will be in defense. Then use that Delta to send the other Gamma. Now if your opponent destroys one of your Deltas. You can use his effect to summon Valkyrion from the deck and boom easy hit stick to have on the field for protection. Next turn summon Berserkion now you have them both until either you get poly or find a way to get yourself out of trouble (if you're in any.)  &nbsp;  Now if you start off with Admancipators and a Weathering Soldier. Do your best not to use the weathering solider unless you already have Fossil Fusion. The Adama's mill effect will more than likely find another weathering solider. It's better to start of with a level 2 tuner so that you can have the opportunity to go into crystal wing. Synchro summon Raptite to searching ANY rock monsters instead of Leonite's Adama card effect.  &nbsp;  My current best combo is CrystalWing and Imperion's effects. Just those two alone stop my opponents whole push. Two gameciels so that you can have extra options for WATER monsters in the grave for Dragite effect. Naturia Beast mills everytime to stop spell cards, Gorgonic Guardian negates monster effects, Stardust Dragon negates destruction effects.  &nbsp;  Left A Very Detailed Explanation for the beginners, Vets will understand this combo easy. Please let me know how you feel about the deck in the comments! Let me know what other things you try!"

Cons</strong>  <em>Pros of playing the deck:</em> <ul>  	<li>The gameplan is really simplistic, which helps avoiding any mistakes in gameplay</li>  	<li>The Floodgate effect of Evilswarm Ophion is still very strong (but very meta dependent though)</li>  	<li>Evilswarm has an inbuilt protection against easy main deck Outs, as it can search its own Spell/Trap protection while also making your opponent unable to summon Kaijus/Pankratops/etc</li>  	<li>'There can only be one' and 'Dimension Shifter' nearly hit every deck, so being able o play them without any downside speaks for this deck</li>  	<li>The deck is not reliant on the graveyard and doesn't search often ( usually 1 time for Infection Pandemic and that's it)</li>  	<li>The deck also isn't really reliant for on field monster effects to go through (Evilswarm Castor's additional summon effect can't be negated with effect Veiler /etc and Rescue rabbit banishes for cost)</li>  	<li>The deck can easily be sided for a match up, as the spots for backrow-cards are not fixed</li>  	<li>in a meta, that isnt dominated by combo decks , your gameplan can catch many people off guard</li>  	<li>The deck leaves a lot of free extra deck space that can be filled with any targets you find helpful</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <em>Cons of playing the deck:</em> <ul>  	<li>'Ash Blossom &amp; Jouyous Spring' or 'PSY-Framegear Gamma' can hit hard against Rescue Rabbit / Ghost Ogre on ophion's search effect also is hard to play against ( notice that if you activated Dimension Shifter, Ghost Ogre can't be activated as it has to be send to the Graveyard; also when Ophion hits the field, PSY-Framegear Gama is turned off)</li>  	<li> If you are playing against Link based decks, your backrow mostly is your only hope</li>  	<li>while Going second, your tools for winning are very limited</li>  	<li>As this deck only plays a few monster negates ( 3 Solemn Strike/ 3 Forbidden Chalice gives a 57% chane to draw at least 1, not counting the potential of Allure of Darkness to draw further through your deck), match-ups against decks with inbuilt backrow removal are very draw dependent.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>Card Ratios &amp; Explaination</strong>  <em>Main Deck</em> <ul>  	<li>3 Evilswarm Heliotrope: We have to play 3 in order to maximize the chance that Rescue Rabbit is live (the chance to draw 2 or more copies of Heliotrope is 3,6%), also It's not as bricky as someone might think, as we can summon it with Evilswarm Castor's effect, use it for Allure of Darkness or just reshuffle it into the deck with Infestation Infection ( besides using it for Rescue Rabbit and Unexpected Dai)</li>  	<li>3 Evilswarm Castor: It's additional summon effect lets you play around every Hand Trap as it can't be negated</li>  	<li>3 Rescue Rabbit: The perfect enabler for the deck, even if its weak against Ash and Gamma</li>  	<li>3 Evilswarm Mandragora: We need targets for Evilswarm Kerykeion/ Castor/ Infestation Infection, also it can be helful going 2nd ( special summoning this plus normal summoning any lvl 4 monster is already a Rank 4 Xyz)</li>  	<li>3 Dimension Shifter: Insanely strong Hand Trap, that can be good going first and 2nd (you literally always use it, exeptyou draw it as your 6t card and need fodder for Allure of Darkness)</li>  	<li>2 Evilswarm Kerykeion: Its a good Mid-Game centered card, but you really want to see other cards in your opening hand ( 2 copies might come up in he long run, also it's a target for Castor)</li>  	<li>1 Evilswarm Castor: Spell/Trap removal that tributes for cost can be useful in niche scenarios, if not, it's at least another Evilswarm Target</li>  	<li>3 Unexpected Dai: Works as a good starter/ bait for Ash;

you should also swap  Forbidden Chalice for Infinite Impermanence; Nibiru/ Forbidden Droplet/Lightning Storm are probably stronger  side Deck options than the cheaper ones I mentioned  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Fun fact: Kaijus are one of my favorite archetypes. I adore the entire Kaiju genre so, the archetype itself is something I love. Deck guide? Deck guide. 3x Bigfoot- 3k beater if you get it out, easy card removal if it's discarded. Underappreciated Danger! imo 3x Chupacabra- draw/tribute fodder, and can special summon a discarded Danger! if itself is discarded. 1x Nessie- Would run at more if I could, but it's limited. 28k wall if you get out that's also just draw/tribute fodder, but if discarded, it gives you another Danger! to replace the lost Nessie, which is amazing. 2x Thunderbird- 28k beater if it special summons itself, can remove possible problem cards like Imperm and Fog Blade that your opponent has set otherwise. 1x Jackalope- Yet again, draw/tribute fodder. But if discarded, gives you another Danger! to act as tribute fodder. Fantastic Danger!, it's limited for a reason. 1x Snek Boy- can't spell his name and i'm not gonna try. Adorable card, and it gives you tribute/draw fodder and it's always tribute fodder no matter what, as it special summons itself when discarded. I'm tempted to get one just to frame it because I love this card 1x Pankratops- Easy special summon and monster removal, but can also serve as tribute fodder. 2x Dogoran- tribute monster, 3k beater 3k Gamaciel- Easy monster removal 2x Jizikuru- Fantastic 33k beater with a built in negate 2x Majesty's Fiend- stop playing lol 1x Radian- literally just tribute a monster, either an opponent's or your's, OTK lol 1x Jupiter- Requires two tributes but that's not very hard for this deck, discards two cards which can be Dangers! for their effects, and steals an opponent's monster to become a big beater 1x Pluto- Also two tributes but, hand info and if you somehow guess write ya get a free monster 3x Thunder King- The boss monster. 33k beater, attacks three times on occasion, can OTK with ease 2x Vanity's Fiend- stop playing the game lol 3x Interrupted Kaiju Slumber- Dark Hole combined with a free monster, just give your opponent a Gamaciel and it's free damage and you can go in for an OTK with ease 3x Kyouto Waterfront- Great field spell, racks up counters fast as fuck as you tear through the opponent and get rid of your own cards, can search a Kaiju when neccesary or provide counters for the Kaiju's own effects 3x Pot of Extravagance- fantastic draw power, what else do u want me to say 2x World Legacy Monstrosity- Leads into the occasional Eternity, and thins out your deck. 3x There Can Only Be One- Locks down nearly any deck and stops them from playinh, making them an easy target to OTK The extra deck is just banish fodder, you might wanna link into Linkuribo then Gardna on occasion though, or maybe make an Eternity, but banish the rest Playing guide Deck is a pretty simple OTK based going second deck. You spam out Dangers! and draw if you didn't open with an Interrupted; if you did open an Interrupted, play it and destroy the board, then special summon your Thunder King and a Gamaciel for the opponent. Afterwards, spam Dangers! for tribute fodder, and tribute into either a Kaiju if you didn't use the Interrupted method, or go into a Fiend or beater with tributes. Rack up counters for Thunder King. Afterwards, set There Can Only Be if you opened with it. Attack the opponent, although you probably won't kill them in the first turn. Use the effects of the Fiends and such to make sure they just can't play, then OTK them entirely. Note: Yes, you'll want to go second. If going first, just set up your floodgates and hope. Maybe make an Eternity as well, or a Pluto for hand info before they even start their plays. Fun fact: I'm mostly blind"

A lot of main deck monsters destroy other monster by effects, this can help bring out Citadel easily through his effect. Machina Possesstorage is a great way to bring out extra deck monsters due to its effect on summon which brings back one machina monster in the graveyard. Possesstorage can also get rid of Spells or traps easily by sending targeting one machina monster you control and one spell or trap card on your opponents field and send them to the hand. This deck can also bring out synchro monsters through Torque Tune Gear. Either use Fortress and Tune Gear to bring out a level 8 synchro or use his effect to equip to a level 4 and synchro summon through that way. The level 8 synchro monster depends on a persons budget."

Powerful Cards Like <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> only can use their on board effects on an opponent’s already established board. This build takes advantage of two main cards <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a>.  <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> lets you discard it and a Nekroz ritual spell to stop your opponent from special summoning from the extra deck during Main Phase 1. Since a player can’t enter battle phase and therefore main phase 2 turn 1, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> is electively a hand trap version of <a data-name=""Domain of the True Monarchs"">Domain of the True Monarchs</a> on turn 1. Also every Nekroz ritual spell lets you banish itself and one Nekroz monster to search another ritual spell, giving you back much needed value when discarded with <a data-name=""Nekroz of  Sophia"">Nekroz of  Sophia</a>.  <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> is an often underutilized tool that has the following effect on field: “Your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of a ""Nekroz"" Ritual Spell Card“ And “""Nekroz"" Ritual Monsters you control cannot be targeted by an opponent's card effects“. This card lets you play around negates that would stop your ritual summons. <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> combined with a ritual summon of <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> can easily disarm your opponent’s monster negates. Its effect when tributed, while not the main reason for its usage in the deck is also relevant allowing for recycling of resources in longer games. It also should be noted that as this card is a level 4 water monster it aids in making <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and then <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>.  The Deck also utilizes the cards <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>,<a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode""> The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, and <a data-name=""Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity"">Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity</a> to help go second. Gizmek Uka is fantastic in this deck as it can punish the usage of the ever popular <a data-name=""Cryston Halqifbrax"">Cryston Halqifbrax</a> with a summon of both itself and <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a> from deck. Gizmek Uka can also fetch both itself and the two non-ritual Impcantation Monsters if the opponent doesn’t play <a data-name=""Cryston Halqifbrax"">Cryston Halqifbrax</a>.  <strong>The Math and Consistency</strong>  While its not perfect odds, this deck is optimized to have some form of blowout over about 85% of the time. The Deck will simply draw one of <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, or <a data-name=""Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity"">Gizmek Uka, the Festive Fox of Fecundity</a> around 78.89% of the time. That’s a healthy base for going second but what else does it have? The deck opens <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and a ritual spell in 17.83% of games, that’s about 1 out of every 5 where your opponent cant use their extra deck to set up negates to stop your ritual summons.  Outside of these blowouts let’s look at Nekroz’s inherent searchability. 10/42 cards in the deck search another nekroz card with no questions asked. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> gets you any Nekroz Monster which gets you <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a> who in turn gets you any Nekroz Ritual spell. Another 13/42 cards search Nekroz cards with a bit of setup. Due to Nekroz’s heavily search reliant playstyle its very hard to calculate exactly how many negates on average this deck can play through. From personal experience being able to play through 1 negate is almost guaranteed, 2 negates is common enough, and 3 negates can be done with a lucky enough hand.  <strong>Side Deck and Extra Deck.</strong>  This deck struggles quite a lot against non-extra deck focused decks. That's not to say its unwinnable but that’s what the side deck is for. We run a backrow destruction package in the form of <a data-name=""Harpie’s feather Duster"">Harpie’s feather Duster</a> and Three copies of <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>. <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> also helps deal with backrow decks. The rest of the cards enable the deck to be played going first. The additional copies <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus </a>are there for the classic nekroz play of setting up a floodgate with <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> style battle protection. <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> combine with any spellcaster Nekroz monster just shuts down any spell-based deck. Last but not least <a data-name=""There can be Only One"">There can be Only One</a> is an easy disruption card for Nekroz to play with as more often than not only one of each type of monsters will be on the field at once.  Most of the Extra deck is focused around enabling <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>. <a data-name=""Herald of the Ark Light"">Herald of the Ark Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> are commonly used for effects when ritual summoning. Everything else was chosen because they either recycle themselves or can be special summoned off of an opponent’s <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> type effects. I also tried to set these up to play around giving Lights and Fire attributes to <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, but several levels didn’t feature enough monsters to do this Perfectly. <a data-name=""Nepthys, The Sacred Flame"">Nepthys, The Sacred Flame</a>, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>, and <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> are al situation tools the deck can use."

I haven't tested the deck yet but I can give a few tips. </em>  <em><strong>XYZ Summoning Tips-</strong> XYZ summoning Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon isn't that hard and you only need Two Level Four Monsters the only tip I can really give you is to only summon Dark Rebellion when it is necessary for example if your opponents monster has like Four Thousand Attack Points then you definitely want to get   out Dark Rebellion and activate its effect.  </em>  <em><strong>Synchro Summoning Tip- </strong>If you want to get Clear Wing Synchro Dragon or Clear Wing Fast Dragon out I'd recommend to first summon Performapal Parrotrio,<strong> </strong>Performapal Spike Eagle and Performapal Stamp Turtle then once you have all the three monsters on the field use Stamp Turtle's Effect to increase Parrotrio's and Spike Eagle's by one. After that you have the required levels to Synchro Summon! Do not summon Clear Wing Synchro Dragon summon Clear Wing Fast Dragon instead since it is more useful. </em>  <em><strong>Fusion Summoning Tips- </strong>Fusion Summoning with a Performapal Deck can pose a problem </em><i>depending on what you draw and what's your starting hand. If you want to get out Starving Venom Fusion Dragon to try and destroy most of your opponents monsters the best way to summon Starving Venom is to Pendulum Summon Two Dark Monsters then summon Performapal Trump Witch and tribute her to add Polymerzation to your hand. For Ru</i><i>ne-Eyes Pendulum Dragon and Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon I can't give any tips with them but if you want to Fusion Summon even more I'd recommend to add Two more Polymerzation's to your deck.</i>  <em>This Deck isn't exactly meant for competitive play but you can still use it!</em>"

The goal is to bring out either Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon or Archfiend Black Skull Dragon, both of which are heavy hitters. Beelze is a good alternate strategy by means of Rokket Tracer for his staying power, however, his lack of protection against lockdown effects tends to make him a little less useful against stall decks. Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon though lacking in protection is a great beat stick especially against stall decks that force this deck to play the long game."

Preforms well with multiple combos and Dragoon is a easy win card. I've play tested it a lot and play this irl aswell. I hope you enjoy this deck.</span>  <span>Main Deck Card Explanations:</span>  1 Toon Ancient Gear Golem - Mostly used as a tribute for Special Summoning Black Luster or if u need a beatstick with piercing  3 Toon BLS - Main Boss Monster of the Toons, once per turn banish effect, can attack the turn he's summoned, 3000 ATK, always a special summon, If you can get 2 on the field you can pull off a Number 97+Number 100 OTK  2 Toon Dark Magican - Main Card used to special summon monsters or get a Toon Kingdom/Search Card 3 is too cloggy, Plenty of R7 XYZ plays with this and Red-Eyes Toon Dragon  3 Red-Eyes Toon Dragon - Used as a way to special summon big toons from hand(so TDM,TBLS,etc), if nothing to special summon after it attacks its first time I usually xyz with TDM if I can or another Red-Eyes Toon.  2 Toon Cyber Dragon - Just like a Normal Cyber Dragon, free special summon if you have no monsters and your opponent does, mostly used if a field wipe happens, otherwise I use it as a discard target for TDM effect.No Xyzs cause he is the only level 5.  3 Toon Gemini Elf - By far the best OG toon with 1900, a discard effect when she attacks directly and the level 4 helps with a lot of xyz plays. Only downside is if Kingdom is destroyed she's destroyed but she is the only card that is destroyed this way.Xyz plays with THL  2 Toon Harpie Lady - The weakest toon attack wise but she is used for her special summon to pop a spell or trap, then if you've got another THL or TGE on the field theres alot of xyz plays like the Utopia OTK or tornado dragon for another spell/trap pop, depends on the situation.  3 The Black Stone of Legend - Main Combo Starter, tributes itself for red-eyes toon dragon, then RETD effect to special summon from hand.  1 Shadow Toon - Opponent takes dmg for the attack of one of their monsters. Can really help in a pinch if you need it. TDM effect searchs any toon card so if you need it from deck to hand to finish a match that's a good way to do it.  1 Terraforming - search for toon kingdom  3 Toon Table of Contents - main search card, isnt once per turn, search for kingdom, bookmark, or page-flip based on what you already have in hand. If you got all 3 search toon terror,toon mask, or toon breifcase.  3 Toon Bookmark - Search but mostly you just want bookmark in the graveyard to protect toon kingdom.  3 Toon Page-Flip - Free Special Summon, turn one always play kingdom then page-flip for a free special summon of either TDM,TBLS, or RETD.TDM and RETD get you another special summon so in my opinion TBLS is the worst one to get when your opponent picks one randomly to summon but he is still good regardless you just don't get another special summon.Other 2 go back into deck. If playing Irl, shuffle the 3 you chose under the table, have your oppenent chose a card.  1 Double or Nothing - Used for the Utopia OTK. 2 LVL 4 into Utopia Double, Double effect, detach and add double or nothing from deck to hand, summon out utopia on top of double, he becomes a 5000 who cant attack directly, Utopia effect to stop his attack then double or nothing to give him another attack at 10000 but it has to be a monster.  1 Comic Hand - Steal an opponents monster, they become a toon, and can attack directly and are protected by toon kingdoms effect.  3 Toon Kingdom - Banish 3 from Deck isn't too bad but if you're relying on dragoon make sure it isn't either dark magician, red-eyes black dragon, or red-eyes fusion cause that bricks the entire dragoon play. Prevents targeted effects on toons and if they'd be destroyed by battle or card effects banish cards from top of deck to keep them on the field instead so if 3 would be destroyed banish 3 from top of deck.  2 Toon Briefcase - Non-targeted way to deal with a big monster that gets summoned, sends it back to deck so really good for monsters that can't be targeted and can't be destroyed by card effects.  2 Toon Mask - Free special summons if you control toon world, target a opponents monster a special summon a monster of equal or less level.  3 Toon Terror - Omni-Negate Counter trap  1 Red-Eyes Fusion - for dragoon, you either use this if you draw it turn 1 or send it to graveyard with Verte Anaconda, like I said earlier if either 3 of the cards get banished say bye to dragoon.  1 Red-Eyes Black Dragon - only used to fuse for dragoon  1 Dark Magician - I play a Red Dark Magician for style points, only used to fuse for dragoon.  That's it for Main Deck Explanations on to Extra Deck.  <span>Extra Deck:</span>  Number 38:Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy - Used for the Numeron Dragon OTK or as a way to steal your opponents spells for materials and prevent attacks on weaker monsters.  Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon - Cannot be destroyed by card effects and inflicts 500 every time your opponent activates a card or effect.  Mecha Phantom Beast Draccosack - detach for 2 tokens, tribute 1 per turn to destroy monsters but cant attack the turn he does, if theres a token he cant be destroyed by battle or card effect.  Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon - OP Broken Boss Monster Card - If you summon this say GG and shake your opponents hand.  Number 11:Big Eye - Take a opponents Monster, cant attack turn it takes one.  Predaplant Verte Anaconda - main way to get dragoon unless you draw red-eyes fusion, pay 2000 life points and send red-eyes fusion to graveyard to fusion summon Dragoon. a simple link 2 for a boss monster.  Utopia Lighting - if utopia gets negated, go into lightning  Utopia - Part of the OTK combo with double, negate and double or nothing for 10000 into a monster  Utopia Double - detach, get double or nothing to hand, then special summon a utopia with double attached as material and the 1 attached to double, utopia gains 2500 with double as material but can attack directly  Time Thief Redoer - can distrupt opponents plays  Tornado Dragon - pop spells/traps  Number 101: Silent Honor Ark - detach 2 to steal a monster as material for this card  Evilswarm Excition Knight - Field Wipe if opponent has more cards  Number 97 - detach to summon Numeron Dragon with Number 38 as material on Numeron  Number 100:Numeron Dragon - detach to gain attack, with number 97 out he becomes a 9000 atk but with number 97 the effect locks you into attacking with numeron  <span>Side Deck</span>  If you wanna play pure toons add pot of extravagance in for the dragoon cards and switch out dragoon and anaconda for another red-eyes flare metal dragon and blackship of corn.  There is to many combos to go into but I hope you learned some plays from the explanations. Main play is 2 monsters on the field for verte anaconda to get dragoon turn one.Thanks for reading :)"

Strengths: Consistency, First-Turn Lockdown, and the ability to power thru at least 3 negat","A budget, OG-Style, for-fun rogue deck with lots of pitching and a single go-first strat - but diverse and powerful enough that going second you can power through many boards. For those of you unfamiliar, objective A will be to get out Simorgh using Reprodocus and anything; and then get out union carrier to attach a thunderbird to it.  For the main big bad combo:  Get out simorgh with one-two cards using either crusadia (50/50 chance to extend into full board), or beast/gates, or any number of other cheeky and easy ways (gold sarc, AOD hawk/roar).  Then you want to, if possible, go into elpy. For this you can use: Brotaur Draco (you will always have this available if you do maximus play) Wyverbuster (searchable) Collapserpent (searchable) Or chaos space to search for one, giving you 7/40 chance of having one as your first card drawn, getting one off a draw, etc.  Once you get to this stage you have a few options.  A: if Chaos creator is in hand, you can make Trish, use trish + some ss'd-off-the-banish material to make carrier. Then use creator to bring back whatever you banished from YOUR OPPONENTS EXTRA DECK (or your own if theirs is really that terrible). You could get friggin toad. ABC. W/e they have that you like. With one more SS you can even make I:P masq. B: if chaos creator is NOT in hand, you can do the whole elpy-&gt;brotaur-&gt;red-eyes shabang and banish elpy for the summon, make carrier off of these mats. You will have one material left for pisty if you choose to extend. If  you can access one more dragon (outside pisty eff), you can easily make trish off of a pisty extender - and therefor make I:P masq, and a next-round apoll. C: You got no dragons for the big combo? Big oof. Don't worry, you can probably still make the infinite-negate combo, at least, and maybe at least a Bagooska or No. 38.  Red-eyes errata may hurt, but you CAN instead search out <a data-name=""Lightpulsar"">Lightpulsar</a> (very uncommonly) to get some decent good recursion. If you decide to use curious, which I don't recommend, you can plug it in to your GY for your elpy&lt;-&gt;<a data-name=""pisty"">pisty</a> combos.  The one thing you do NOT want to do is lose simorgh before your end phase - but if you ABSOLUTELY must, you can probably clean board with Almarduke. Best of all: if your opponent tried to nibiru you here, they'll be screwed over. Also, if you rich guys have Nibiru, run a copy of that instead of raigeki in your side."

IT WILL LOSE TO A WELL TIMED HAND TRAP! <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">So the deck is not linear (as the card advantage all come from drawing cards) besides the opening play of trying to make Halc (which is either rescue cat or figure someway to dump a tuner and another monster from your opening hand onto the field) for Deskbot 1 to Auroradon to Warbluran.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">From there, plays branch out depending on remaining hand but usually, use the warbluran to tribute a token to become lvl 2 and synchro away into librarian. your field should be TG librarian and Deskbot 1.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Now from there, synchro climb your way with Librarian draws and adapt to what you draw with ragin, stardust warrior, Ravenous crocodragon. Use your extra deck monster zone for monsters you know you wont keep on field to keep your main monster zone as free as possible. the easiest way to make Cosmic Blazar Dragon (or Quasar if you like it better) is actually with a Librarian, Unicore and Marshall Metal Marcher (tho Librarian, Ragin and formula also works ofc)</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Your best main deck fabled is Grimro (duh) and Krus (after you have a full GY so it functions as any fabled and also revive unicore in the end after being used as material)</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Dont be afraid to pot of avarice away less optimal creatures as sometimes its neccessary (but usually you would target extra deck monster besides auroradon because thats for Borreload savage dragon, and the next best targets are Grimro and Krus to hopefully draw them again)</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The new Tuner Alfac is similar to Kushano except its a hard once per turn but special summon itself and banish like Ganesha. So with Ganesha its an easy ragin synchro. these two are usually what I get with rescue cat to link into Halc in the beginning</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">The Field spell is decent as it dumps kushano (or Alfac) and an extra discard outlet but otherwise its just an extra search target for the other New card, Marchosia (that special itself like Chawa, or be discarded to search the field or trap. both Hard once per turn effects). I am testing the trap card as another search target but probably will cut it.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">everything else is trial and error. again, the deck is not linear because its super reliant on draw (and fixing the hand with grimro after the draws) so it requires a lot of thinking in trying to reach the synchros. but it is very fun to play!</p> PS. it is very satisfying to use Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon to run over a Red-Eyes Dragoon, you should try it!"

It is also has a fun gimmick to it.,"Okay so too jet stream this Fire Kings like being destroyed to use their effects. Main goal is use that Gimmicks to your advantage. Secondly all ""Fire King"" monster share this effect ""If a face-up ""Fire King"" monster you control is destroyed by a card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand."" called the ""Fire King Summon"". There are two exceptions without this ability <strong>Fire King Avatar Arvata </strong>and <strong>Fire King High Avatar Garunix</strong>. Thirdly they all have a floating effect upon their destruction.  This Deck has four Boss monsters plus a few option in the Side Deck  <span><em><strong>Boss Monsters</strong></em></span>  <strong>Fire King High Avatar Garunix</strong> likes being destroyed by card effect to only resurrect himself on the NEXT Standby Phase and destroy all other monsters on the Field indiscriminately. However, if he is destroyed by battle he can bring out a different ""Fire King"" monster from your Deck to the Field. <strong>Arvata</strong> would be a good choice because of his resurrection ability. Works well with another copy of himself and <strong>Sacred Phoenix</strong>. This will clear the Field at the start of each turn.  <strong>Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys </strong>is much like <strong>High Garunix</strong> but destroy card in the Spell and Trap card zones.  <strong>Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner </strong>is basically a 2600, 8 started beat stick. Easy to get out because he can summon himself when one of your fire-type monster(s) is destroyed either by battle or card effect. Then deal half the ATK of one of the FIRE monsters that was sent to the Graveyard.  <strong>Bonfire Colossus </strong>is another 2600, 8 started beat stick, and easy to get out and can trigger any ""Fire King"" monster's effect. Summons himself by destroying two of FIRE monsters that you control on the Field.  <span><em><strong>Other Monsters</strong></em></span>  <strong>Fire King Avatar Arvata </strong>one of the ""Black Sheep"" of the ""Fire King"" family that doesn't do the ""Fire King Summon"". However, he has his own fun an unique ability. Being a Spell Speed 2 quick effect to negate the effect of a monster upon its activation. At the coast of destroying one FIRE monster from either the Hand or Field. Upon his own destruction by any matter, you can Special Summon one FIRE Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast monster from your Graveyard, except himself. The catch is the it has its effects negated, and is also destroyed during the End Phase. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Both of his effects are once per a turn. However this is a good way to bring back a <strong>High Garunix</strong> that has been beaten in battle, or bring him out from your Hand with the 1st effect.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Barong </strong>after his defeat by card effect he sends a postcard to another ""Fire King"" monster in the Deck and during the <strong>NEXT </strong>Standby Phase the ""Fire King"" monster whom received the postcard is brought to the Hand. this is a good way to search for ""Fire King"" monsters in particular <strong>High Garunix</strong>, <strong>Arvata</strong>, or <strong>Yaksha</strong>.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Garunix</strong> can bring any ""Fire King Avatar"" monster from your Deck to the Field. However, <strong>Garunix </strong>must be die by your opponent's card effect or in a fight. <strong>NOTE: Arvata</strong>, or <strong>Yaksha</strong> are great targets for this effect.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Kirin </strong>brings another FIRE monster from the Deck with itself to the Graveyard when he goes in any matter. <strong>High Garunix</strong> or <strong>Sacred Phoenix </strong>are okay targets for this effect to set up a combo with <strong>Arvata </strong>or the Spell cards <strong>Onslaught of the Fire Kings </strong>or <strong>Circle of the Fire Kings</strong>.  <strong>Fire King Avatar Yaksha </strong>destroys one card in your Hand or your Field upon his destructions in any matter. This is really good to be able to active any ""Fire King"" monster's effects from the hand.  <strong>Flamvell Firedog </strong>when he defeats an opponents monster by battle you can bring any FIRE monster from your Deck to the Field with 200 DEF or less except another copy of himself. <strong>Yaksha</strong>, <strong>Barong</strong>, <strong>Flame Tiger</strong>, or <strong>Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner</strong>.  <strong>Flame Ruler </strong>counts as two tributes for a FIRE monster.  <b> Ultimate Baseball Kid </b>gains 1000 ATK for each FIRE monster on the Field except for himself, and can send one FIRE monster you control to inflict 500 damage to your opponent.  <strong>Little Chimera </strong>is an ATK booster for FIRE monsters and ATK bane to WATER monsters.  <strong>Raging Flame Sprite </strong>is a good card all around.  <strong>Fencing Fire Ferret </strong>drags down another face up monster your opponents controls with it and inflicts 500 damage to your opponent at the same time.  <strong>Flame Tiger </strong>is just a 1800, 4 star beat stick. With a decent effect.  <span><em><strong>Spell Cards</strong></em></span>  <strong>Fire King Island </strong>well is a ticking time bomb. By that when it goes boom all your monsters on your Field go boom with it. However your ""Fire Kings"" will like that. Plus the bonus effects. 1st effect ""During your Main Phase: You can destroy 1 monster in your hand or you control, and if you do, add 1 ""Fire King"" monster from your Deck to your hand."" <strong>NOTE: </strong>It can activate ""Fire King"" effects from the hand plus searches for another ""Fire King"". It's 2nd allows you to Special Summon 1 FIRE Winged Beast-Type monster from your hand when you have no monsters on the Field. <strong>NOTE: </strong>You can only use one of these effects per a turn.  <strong>Circle of the Fire Kings </strong>allows you to basically swap one FIRE monsters for another. In other words swapping one of your FIRE monsters for a defeated <strong>High Garunix</strong> back from the beyond.  <strong>Onslaught of the Fire Kings </strong>brings out one FIRE Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast monster from your Deck when you don't have any monsters on the Field. However, at the coast of its effect and it being destroyed at the End Phase. Wink Wink ""Fire Kings"" like that. Especially <strong>Hight Garunix</strong>.  <strong>Burden of the Mighty </strong>because this deck lacks ATK power using <strong>Burden of the Mighty </strong>to even the playing Field.  <span><em><strong>Trap Cards</strong></em></span>  <strong>Backfire </strong>does what its name suggest. When your FIRE monsters are destroyed by any means deals 500 damage to your opponent.  <strong>Kickfire </strong>is like Backfire but with counters and your monsters need to be destroyed by card effect. then you can deal 1000 damage to your opponent. <strong>NOTE:</strong> ""Fire Kings"" like being destroyed.  <strong>Phoenix Wing Wind Blast </strong>is nothing overly special just discard a card and place an opponents card on top of their deck.  <strong>Regretful Rebirth </strong>if <strong>High Garunix </strong>is beaten in battle you can bring him back with this card and use its effect at the same time.  <strong>Horn of the Phantom Beast </strong>is an ATK booster for Beast and Beast-Warrior monsters, also gives a +1 hand advantage upon defeating an opponents monster.  <em><strong><span>Extra Deck and Side Deck</span></strong></em>  Are added mostly because they look cool. They are useable but its not recommended. While the Side Deck give option of Boss Monsters that synergize well with FIRE monsters to Swap out <strong>Bonfire Colossus, </strong><strong>Cataclysmic Scorching</strong> <strong>Sunburner</strong>, <strong>Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys </strong>if you want.  Well Hope you enjoyed and Good Luck and have Fun."

Using Melffy and rescue rabbits to generate advantages and tribrigade to break apart boards. ,"Use Tribrigade to set up negates and push for games and melffy to enable follow up in the future turns.  &nbsp;  <strong>Fraktall/Tenki</strong>  Look for access to Tri-brigade Fraktall, Fracktall -&gt; Kit -&gt; Nervall  enable you to add Fraktall/Kerass with 3 bodies in grave.  Add Fraktall if you don't have/want to extend, since the 1900 ATK will allow it to survive to the next turn easier compared to Kerass.  Add Kerass for extending plays beyond Rescue Rabbit and later plays, or combining with with a kalantosa in hand.  They will enable you to banish the 3 bodies to summon Simorgh, Bird of Divinity and at end phase summon Mist Valley Apex Avian for a negate.  &nbsp;  <strong>Catty and Puppy(or Puppy)</strong>  If you have Catty and Puppy in hand, there are 2 lines of plays.  Use Puppy to summon Kalantosa to destroy 1 card, and Catty to search Hop Ear Squadron.  Hop Ear Squadron target Kalantosa, summon Herald.  While Herald is a negate, it also banishes monster from the deck and hand sent to GY.  This will sometime force decks to enter the battle phase to eliminate Herald before continuing combos.  Alternatively, search Rescue Rabbit or Kerass for plays next turn or  Alpha, the Master of Beasts, to out threats.  &nbsp;  <strong>Rescue Rabbit:</strong>  Puppy Catty:  Tribute Rabbit, summon Puppy, Catty, overlay into Excited Melffy  Tribrigade:  Tribute Rabbit, Summon Puppt/Catty and Tribrigade Kit.  Overlay for Melffy of the Forest, detach Kit, mill Nervall and add Kerass.  Summon Kerass, Banish 3 for Simorgh, Bird of divinity.  You can also banish 4 for Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen if you plan to use Puppy to trigger its banish effects.  &nbsp;  <strong>Nervall/Kit+Beast/Winged Beast/Beast-warrior:</strong>  Summon Nervall/Kit -&gt;Almiraj  (Kit mils Nervall)  Add Kerass, Pitch fodder, Summon Kerass  Kerass banish 2, summon Raidraptor Wise Strix  Almiraj effect, target Kerass/Wise Strix  Wise Strix +Kerass -&gt;Simorgh, Bird of Divinity  &nbsp;  <strong>Ending Games:</strong>  -Use Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom to summon tribrigade/rescue rabbit locked in hand for additional bodies or Kalantosa to pop a card.  -Use Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller to summon monster after the battle phase to return it to your hand.  -Don't be afraid to link Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen for other monster like Accesscode Talker or Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom.  -Omen can search cards like Rescue Rabbits to extend.  -Sandayu summons a large token and is a extra beast body when sent to the grave.  -Use Acesscode Talker to chain block effects of Tribrigade links.  -Alpha, the Master of Beasts can target monster other than himself, you can bounce several cards at once.  -Consider holding back on Fraktall's second effect if you have enough bodies in grave, or use it after you summon Fraktall and use  Fraktall's effect summon a body.  &nbsp;  <strong>Where is Obedience School?</strong>  Obedience Schooled locks you into beast, and the end board for that consist of Excited Melffy and Melffy of the Forest. While powerful at times, generating pops,negates and followups, all requires Excited Melffy to resolve and your opponent to summon a monster. This is a issue since effects that activates on summon cannot be negated until you commit to a herald, which is the last interaction you have.  Compared to Mist Valley Apex Avian, Avian can negate cards at any time in the combo and cannot be targeted while dodging Nibiru. Additionally, the beast lock makes it difficult to break boards going second, taking away access to Access code Talker that pops 1-2 cards, or Omen, who banish without targetting.  &nbsp;  <strong>Where is Nealogia AA-Zeus?</strong>  It is a consideration when you lack enough reach to kill your opponent. I prefer passing on Omen for a banish and a chance to grab cards like Rescue Rabbits and Alpha compare to a board nuke. Please let me know if you feel like its good enough to run!  &nbsp;  <strong>Why the Triple Tactical Talent?</strong>  The deck should have enough handtraps and setup to survive going first, and the Triple Tactical Talent enable you to get information for optimal disruption or get some help breaking tough boards. Do keep in mind about the restriction on tribrigades's link material when stealing monsters.  &nbsp;  <strong>D.D. Crow?</strong>  Its a winged beast handtrap that can be banished for Tri-Brigade. While not quite the format staple it was, many decks still rely on the GY to generate or recur resources.  &nbsp;  <strong>Infinite Negates/Floodgates?</strong>  Barrier Statue is powerful, but its stats are weak. While we want to survive to the next turn, we cannot let the opponent build up boards with several negates since breaking those boards requires drawing above average hands.  Apex Avian and Thunderbird loop is powerful, but add additional bricks to the deck that is doesn't want to draw several of its cards. While you don't want to draw cards like Kalantosa,Nervall, or Kit, they can still help in breaking boards or starting combos. For example, Kalantosa can be used with Ferrijit the Barren Blossom to destroy cards, or overlayed with Kerass to summon Excited Melffy but drawing it alone is terrible. Nervall and Kit can start combos, but require other specific cards.  &nbsp;  Can I run one Kalantosa?  I wouldn't recommend it since having a second one in deck allow you to use it with Excited Melffy and Puppy in one turn.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

I desided to try pure Kozmos. They were seemed too slow so I decided to add Artifact Scythe to slow down my opponent as well. Which actually worked pretty well. Going first against a combo deck, scythe just messes them up. Not a meta deck but can kill combo heavy meta decks with just scythe and can OTK them. Going second against combo decks however can be problematic due to the deck being slow and usually needing some setting up with Kozmo Tnican. This deck is also good against control decks.

Means we dont even use Zephyros while ending with the same Bardiche+Redoer(trap mat)+Dark Requiem(3 mat,"After billions of testing, I found that going Force Strix before Wise Strix eats more resource/needs more brick than going to Wise Strix directly. So, we cut all the generic r4nk engines, the only lv4 we need are the Raidraptor ones. I will explain the cards role first, before the combo.  Starters: 3 Tribute Lanius (+1 sending Mimicry), 3 Mimicry (+1), and Raiders Wing (+1 but have to start with Force Strix, it means dead if drawn with Strangle Lanius, best as combo piece). Extenders: 3 Vanishing, 3 Pain Lanius (it can become lv4), 2 Strangle Lanius (we need 2 as combo pieces) and Singing Lanius (dead if drawn with Strangle Lanius). The non-lv4: Heel Eagle, Danger Thunderbird (possible +1 but can miss), and Caligo Claw Crow. The PKs: 2 Silent Boots (to guarantee Bardiche effect, can play 1 tho), and 2 RUM Force, Shade Brigandine (combo piece, can be extender but Redoer will lose its disruption), Fog Blade (extra disruption if we draw either the RUM/Shade Brigandine).  The combo is <strong>Wise Strix+lv4</strong>, but gotta be careful to use the combo pieces cus all of them is once per turn. If we didn't open the starter, it means we have to put 3 Dark Winged-Beast (1 of them is lv4) on field. Wise Strix will summon Mimicry/Raiders Wing (depends on which one we havent used), overlay it with other lv4 we have to Force Strix, use Force add Strangle/Singing Lanius (ss it), use Wise set RUM Force, use Mimicry/Raiders Wing in GY (Mimicry can add Nest/Pain/Strangle), ss the extender, make Rusty Bardiche with Force+Wise Strix, use Bardiche send Boots set Shade Brigandine, ss Shade Brigandine on Bardiche link marker, make Force again with Strangle/Singing + the extender, use Force add another Strangle, use RUM Force banish 3 (dont banish our +1 or Heel Eagle) ss Arsenal Falcon, use Arsenal (dont detach Force) ss Vanishing, use Vanishing ss Strangle from hand, use Strangle ss lv4 from GY, make Redoer with Shade Brigandine on Bardiche link marker, use Bardiche destroy Arsenal, use Arsenal ss Ultimate Falcon, make Dark Rebellion with the remaining lv4 on Bardiche link marker, use Boots GY eff add RUM Force, set it.  On the opponent's main phase, we can use RUM Force to trigger Bardiche while summoning 3 mats Dark Requiem. Pay attention to the combo cus using Strangle effect as starter play kills the full combo (das why its only 2 copies, not 3 ofs despite being generic dark extender). Against Mekk-Knighy/zone reliant deck, we gotta place the Nest/RUM/Fogblade on the free zone or with Ultimate Falcon cus it is immune. We're using D.D. Crow as handtrap cus it's useful in combo while being not too bad against meta (Dogma: Titaniklad/Shaddoll monster, Halq: Martial Metal target/001/Plaguespreader, dino: Miscellaneousarus, Eld: anything, Zoo: Ramram), but bad against Dragoon/Zexal running rampant in TCG.  Pros: Super consistent legit board with follow-up (Nest/Raiders Wing).  Cons: 2 cards combo (3 if we dont open the +1).  &nbsp;"

There are three main ways to begin: Black Metal Dragon, Starliege Seyfert or Chaos Space.  If you start first, summon Black Metal Dragon. Now, this can be accomplished by Normal Summoning it from the hand but you can also Special Summon it from the deck with One For One. Then Link it for Striker Dragon to get Boot Sector Launch and Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Banish Striker Dragon to Special Summon RED MD and then use its effect to Special Summon Black Metal Dragon from the graveyard. Then use them to link summon Romulus. Grab Dragon Ravine. Activate Ravine and discard a card to send Absorouter from the deck to the Graveyard. Though, if you have Absorouter in your hand, discard it and then send Brotaur from the deck to the grave. Next, grab Rokket Tracer and add it to the hand. Replace Ravine with Boot Sector Launch and then Special Summon Rokket Tracer. Now, destroy Boot Sector and special summon a Level 4 Rokket from your deck. Then you use Rokket Tracer to Link Summon Pisty then use Romulus and your other Rokket to Link Summon Quadborrel. Then use Pisty to special summon from your Graveyard or Special Summon one of your banished dragons. Link then both for Dillingerous Dragon. Now, activated Quadborrel to discard a card and destroy Dillingerous. This special summons Tracer, your Level 4 Rokket and Dillingerous Back. Now, use Quadborrel, Dillingerous and one of your Rokkets to Link Summon Borrelend Dragon.

There are three main ways to begin: Black Metal Dragon, Starliege Seyfert or Chaos Space.  If you start first, summon Black Metal Dragon. Now, this can be accomplished by Normal Summoning it from the hand but you can also Special Summon it from the deck with One For One. Then Link it for Striker Dragon to get Boot Sector Launch and Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Banish Striker Dragon to Special Summon RED MD and then use its effect to Special Summon Black Metal Dragon from the graveyard. Then use them to link summon Romulus. Grab Dragon Ravine. Activate Ravine and discard a card to send Absorouter from the deck to the Graveyard. Though, if you have Absorouter in your hand, discard it and then send Brotaur from the deck to the grave. Next, grab Rokket Tracer and add it to the hand. Replace Ravine with Boot Sector Launch and then Special Summon Rokket Tracer. Now, destroy Boot Sector and special summon a Level 4 Rokket from your deck. Then you use Rokket Tracer to Link Summon Pisty then use Romulus and your other Rokket to Link Summon Quadborrel. Then use Pisty to special summon from your Graveyard or Special Summon one of your banished dragons. Link then both for Dillingerous Dragon. Now, activated Quadborrel to discard a card and destroy Dillingerous. This special summons Tracer, your Level 4 Rokket and Dillingerous Back. Now, use Quadborrel, Dillingerous and one of your Rokkets to Link Summon Borrelend Dragon. Then, use Borrelend's effect to target your remaining Rokket so you can special summon the other Rokket from the Graveyard. Then synchro summon for Borreload Savage Dragon. Equip it with Romulus. Now, you have two negates you can use and better if you have more negates available in hand.  You can figure out how to use Chaos Space and Starliege Seyfert."

All cards are legal as of 11/4/2020.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Strategy:</strong></span>  Your strategy going first should be to turbo out <strong>Shaddoll Schism </strong>(in order to summon <strong>El Shaddoll Winda </strong>on your opponents turn) by sending<strong> El Shaddoll Apkallone</strong> and <strong>Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</strong> to the graveyard using <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong>'s effect.  For longer matches you can repeatedly send <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> and <strong>PSY-Framelord Omega</strong> to the graveyard using <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong>'s effect to pop one of your opponent's cards and then recycle your resources back to the extra deck.  You can stop your opponent's plays using the powerful and searchable trap card <strong>Dogmatika Punishment.</strong>  When you have a clear board, an OTK can be performed by using <strong>Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted's</strong> effect to boost your Dogmatika cards attack power. You can also use <strong>Invoked Augoeides'</strong>s effect to banish a fusion monster from the graveyard to gain a temporary attack boost.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Card Choice:</strong></span>  Both handtraps <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> and <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> can be link summoned into <strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> and then <strong>Secure Gardna</strong>; doing so puts an extra deck monster on the field immediately allowing you to special summon any of the Dogmatika cards from your hand. This makes <strong>Effect Veiler </strong>arguably more valuable over the other popular handtrap <strong>PSY-Framegear Gamma</strong>.  We run two of <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong> and <strong>Dogmatika Fleurdelis</strong> as a precaution against banishing them when we activate <strong>Pot of Desires</strong>.  Given the popularity of powerful extra deck monsters such as <strong>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</strong> we play several outs to hard-to-get-rid-of monsters: <ul>  	<li><strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong>Strengths:</strong></span>  The deck is very consistent. You can start your plays using just one card such as <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> or <strong>Magical Meltdown</strong>.  There is a lot of room for hand traps or other going second cards depending on the match-up.  Your turn one board is very threatening. You can end on a powerful floodgate and multiple negates (<strong>Invoked Mechaba, El Shaddoll Winda, Dogmatika Fleurdelis</strong>)  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Weaknesses:</strong></span>  This deck works works best if you're familiar with your opponent's strategy. You can easily lose advantage if you destroy or negate the wrong cards during your opponent's combo play.  Dogmatika effects can lock you out of the extra deck for a turn. Be mindful of when you cannot summon invoked fusion monsters.  This deck suffers if you cannot resolve <strong>Dogmatika Maximus </strong>because your opponent does not play extra deck monsters.  Your opponent can potentially counter <strong>Dogmatika Maximus</strong> with cards such as<strong> Cyber Dragon Nova</strong> or <strong>Elder Entity N'tss.</strong>  This deck is reliant on searching cards from the deck and sending cards to the graveyard and is therefore susceptible to hand traps such as <strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong> and <strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>."

I have been playing random decks for as long as I can remember and just decided to get into the meta. This deck proved to be an absolutely amazing way to get started. I found the deck to be EXTREMELY good at doing what sky strikers do even when some cards are banned or limited. This specific deck excels in categories: Clearing your opponent's board, and attacking your opponent slowly but surely. In conclusion, I recommend this deck 100% for any cause whether it be to get started in the meta or to have an EXTREMELY strong deck that is insanely fun to play."

Shame. Anyway, I decided to build my own version of the deck in my futile attempts to make Ghostrick work, because I love Ghostrick. Note that this deck is really more so an expierement, so any suggestions are appreciated.  Deck guide. 1x Mummy- Great extra normal summon, but locks you into dark monsters, which conflicts with the subterrors. I decided to run at 1 to avoid the xenophobia of it. 3x Skeleton- Banishes cards from the top of your opponent's deck, can be a huge mill if you've set up a board 2x Jiangshi- Easy searcher, although it's quite slow 1x Yeti- serves to stall out and protect your weak boss monsters 3x Witch- just easy book of moon on legs 2x Yuki-Onna- pretty slow but still another book of moon on legs 3x Fairy- Book of Moon and monster recovery, fantastic for the archetype 2x Nekomusume- Another Book of Moon on legs... i think im seeing a pattern here 3x Doll- Book of Eclipse on legs, and a nice special summon to set up for more plays 2x Jackfrost- Negates an attack and another book of moon on legs, also special summons himself for later 2x Mary- Easy special summons, helps to get out the XYZ 3x Ultramafus- Easy special summon and interacts well with the ghostricks flipping themselves3 3x Speleogeist- book of moon and cripples and opponent's boss monster, also see above 2x Stalagmo- Nice draw and GY setup, also easy special summon with the ghostricks 2x Umastryx- Easy monster removal and special summons itself with the ghostricks 3x Guru- Reuses flip effects, it's also part of a lock but I forget what the lock is tbh 3x Archer- shuffles monsters into the deck if they're face down, interacts really well with cards like Book of Moon and a lot of the Ghostrick's effects 3x Fiendess- Nice special summon and negate 3x Clash-  Nice stat boost, reuses cards 3x Hidden City- Negates attacks and reuses flip effects 3x Book of Moon- helps the deck as this is Book of Moon: the deck, so 2x Go-Round- Another book of moon that reuses flip monsters 3x Break- nice special summon that can go into an XYZ 3x Succesion- searches flip monsters and such, good card 2x Angel of Mischief- Boss monster lol 2x Alucard- removes set cards to fuck over decks like Altergiest, nice monster to rank up in to Angel 2x Socuteboss- Monster removal and basically eradicates a monster zone 2x Dullahan- Cripples a monster, making it easier to run over 2x Behemoth Fiendess- Nice special summon and GY setup Playing guide It's not super complex. Get out your Ghostricks and use their effects to flip them face down, then special summon some of the behemoths. Afterwards, flip them back up with one of the other card effects and overlay them into an XYZ, rank up that XYZ into a Mischief. Protect Mischief and try to get her to 10 if you want, as you go in for an OTK with the strong behemoths. Any suggestions are highly appreciated, as again, this is more of a test than anything.

A Ghostrick deck dedicated to Angel of Mischief's alternate win con, by stalling and drawing to get her to 10. It's quite horrible and degenerate and I love it. And yes, I hate myself too; don't go and whine in the comments about ""degeneracy"", this is just a deck I made for shits and giggles man. Just run Cosmic Cyclone if you hate Mystic Mine that much. Anyways, deck guide. 3x Mummy- Much more usable than the last deck, since this deck only runs dark monsters. Fantastic extra normal summon 3x Skeleton- hee hee, deck mill/banish go brrr 2x Jiangshi- slow ass searcher, but it's the best you're getting in Ghostricks 1x Yeti- helps stall and protect Angel 3x Witch- Book of moon on legs, helps slow the opponent 2x Yuki-onna- also  book of moon on legs 3x Fairy- Book of Eclipse and monster recovery in one 3x Doll- Book of Eclipse on legs, also special summons and easy monster 2x Jackfrost- Basically attack negation if your mystic mine is dead or if you didnt open one 2x Lantern- see above 3x Mary- easy special summon 3x Ragged Gloves- part of the Phantom Knights engine, buffs and searches 3x Anchient Cloak- Searches, part of the Phantom Knights engine 3x Silent Boots- Easy special summon for an XYZ, part of the engine 3x Mystic Mine- Centerpiece of the deck, stalls out the opponent to get Angel to 10 1x Terraforming- Searches Mystic 1x Metaverse- Also searches/activates Mystic 3x Extragance- Easy draw, 3 of all the XYZ and such so there's not much risk 3x Angel- Get it to 10 lol 3x Alucard- removes set cards for stuff like Altergiest, also ranks up into Angel 3x Socuteboss- Monster removal, rank up into Angel 3x Dullahan- Cripples a monster and ranks up into Angel 1x Linkuribo- Banish lol 1x Unicorn- banish lol 1x Pheonix- banish lol Playing guide This deck, like my other Ghostrick one, is quite simple. Activate Mystic Mine or search it to stall out as long as possible. Use your Ghostricks to either; get enough out to make an XYZ, or set one and pass, as your opponent will most likely be unable to kill it due to Mystic Mine. Afterwards, Flip summon and normal summon, etc etc, and XYZ into Angel. From there, just stall and draw to get her to 10, and watch as everyone at your locals and play group shuns you. Any suggestions are appreciated because this deck is top tier shit. Have a good day."

I really like <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, so I wanted to make a deck around her. And what do you know? 2 of the best flip monsters (<strong>Deus</strong> and <strong>Pot</strong>) are both level 9 and possess types and attributes that are different than <strong>Tarotrei's</strong> making them <strong>Monstrosity</strong> targets. I see this deck as a culmination of the best flip strategies available (similar to how PePe was in its prime, making use of the best pendulums available). The only thing I think I missed that deserved a chance was Shaddolls, but they don't have the position interaction of Subterrors, their levels are too small, and let's be honest, when was the last time you saw a Shaddoll player set and pass? They only do it if they have to or if the monster was summoned face-down, but most of the time they will be using the Shaddoll's monsters 2nd effect. Besides, u don't remember Shaddolls for their flip effects, do u? U remember <strong>Construct</strong>. And <strong>Winda</strong>. Fusion monsters. Sometimes summoned during your turn.  Oh yeah, FLIP effects are treated as mandatory effects. So even if the effect is optional, you will never miss timing with FLIP effects.  Putting that aside, let's get into the ratios:  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Monsters</span></strong>  <strong>Nibiru</strong>: Great hand trap, searchable off gallant granite, and can be used to pay the full cost of a ritual. It also helps when going second.  <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong>: His first effect doesn't matter much, as you'll most likely flip him urself by the time he's summoned. His floating effect isn't a big deal either, but it can search <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. The main effect we want is the floodgate. After being flipped, it doesn't let ur opponent activate monster effects on the field. Continuous effects, as well as monster effects off the field, will not be negated. His other purposes are being a <strong>Monstrosity</strong> target and a big ritual material.  <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>: Lvl 9, so he's a <strong>Monstrosity</strong> target. He also makes for an easy ritual summon. When he is flipped, he gives u access to 1 of 4 effects: <strong>Pot of Greed</strong>, <strong>Giant Trunade</strong>, <strong>Raigeki</strong>, or the <strong>Forceful Sentry</strong>. That's right: all of those effects are on normal spell cards, 3 of which are banned, and the last of which is limited.  <strong>Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric</strong>: Our first Subterror. Same w/  <strong>Deus</strong> and <strong>Pot</strong>, he makes an easy ritual and is a target for <strong>Monstrosity</strong>. Upon being flipped, he can take control of an opponent's set monster until the end of your next turn. This may sound situational, but between <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Subterror Guru</strong>, you'll be flipping ur opponent's monsters left and right. Another big thing to note: since you can flip ur monsters during your opponent's turn, you can use take a monster they control during their turn, and keep it until the end of ur turn. Unlike <strong>Mind Control</strong>, u have no restrictions on what u an do w/ the monster.  <strong>Subterror Guru</strong>: When he's flipped, he searches a Subterror card. Then, you can flip another monster on the field along w/ him face-down, becoming a Spell Speed 2 effect if u control another face-up Subterror card. Note that flipping, for example, <strong>Subterror Final Battle</strong> during ur opponent's turn will allow you to use <strong>Guru's</strong> second effect as if it was a quick effect, but only during that chain (unless you had a different face-up Subterror card, of course).  <strong>Deskbot 003</strong>: So ritual-focused decks have this problem: they are not naturally consistent. Thankfully, we have been give loads of Ritual support over the years. I could have had <strong>Manju</strong> here, and don't get me wrong I am considering using him. But why use <strong>Manju </strong>and search half of the requirements, w/o actually providing the fuel for the summon, when i could use a one-card combo and set up the full ritual for free? It takes up a few spots in the Extra Deck, sure, but we never really needed it, did we? We'll get into how the combo works later.  <strong>Subterror Fiendess</strong>: An omni-negate from ur hand if ur able to flip a Subterror face-down, and, while on the field can flip a monster you control (including herself) to special summon a Subterror from your hand or GY.  <strong>Deskbot 001</strong>: Needed for the <strong>Deskbot 003</strong> combo. No, we r not running multiples to mitigate the chances of a garnet, we are running 2 because the combo actually uses 2. Besides, <strong>001</strong> isn't as much of a garnet as in other engines, as even if you draw one of them <strong>Halq</strong> can summon from the hand. Even if you drew both, it still possible to pull the combo off, it would just require a bit of luck.  <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>: The entire reason I made the deck. Her archetype is worthless, but she alone is worth it. Gives you an option of <strong>Book of Moon</strong> or <strong>Book of Taiyou</strong> every turn at Spell Speed 2. Then, during your end phases, you can summon a flip monster from your hand or GY. She is your main target for <strong>WL Monstrosity's</strong> second effect, which is the one you will be using the most, as all of the other level nines in the deck share the attribute of EARTH.  <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>: Part of the Deskbot Combo. Nekroz is one of the best ritual archetypes, and <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong> is easily one of the best ritual monsters in the game, negating the effect of all face-up monsters that were summoned from the Extra Deck.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>: Practically the only reason the deck is consistent. Able to search both <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>, but can also grab <strong>Tarotrei</strong> from the GY.  <strong>Terraforming</strong>: Searches <strong>The Hidden City</strong>. If this were a pure Subterror Deck, we would also use <strong>Metaverse</strong>, but since we are not completely reliant upon it, we should be fine.  <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>: Ritual Spell for <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, searchable off <strong>Pre-Prep</strong>. It has a GY effect that allows you to banish it from the GY to search a Prediction Princess monster (in this case, <strong>Tarotrei</strong>). Note that none of the effects are once-per-turn; it's just you can't use the GY effect the turn it was sent to the GY.  <strong>Nekroz Kaleidoscope</strong>: My favorite Nekroz ritual spell, it lets you use an Extra Deck monster for your Ritual Summon. Part of the Deskbot Combo.  <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>: I've referenced this card a few times already. It has 2 effects for you to pick from. The first allows you to special summon a level 9 monster from your hand. Can't summon a Ritual Monster, but I digress. Its second effect is the more important one. You target a level 9 monster you control and summon 2 level nine monsters from your deck, as long as the attributes and types of the monsters are different than the target's. The only drawback is that these monsters cannot attack and will be destroyed during the End Phase. So what can you do with them? Well, for starters you can flip em face down w/ <strong>Tarotrei</strong> or <strong>Guru</strong>. Or could use em for an Xyz/Link. All goes down to you and what you see as the best option.  <strong>The Hidden City</strong>: Target for <strong>Terraforming</strong>, the core of any Subterror Deck. Upon activation, you can search a Subterror monster. Once per turn, you can flip a face-down Subterror face-up. Lastly, once per turn, you can flip a face-down Subterror face-up to negate an attack.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  <strong>Subterror Final Battle</strong>: I would like to raise this up to 3, but I still have not found a card to take out. It allows you to choose one of four effects and then resets itself afterward instead of going to the GY. The effects are: 1) <strong>Book of Taiyou</strong> for Subterror monsters 2) <strong>Book of Moon</strong> for Subterror monsters 3) Turing the ATK/DEF of a Subterror monster to its combined original ATK/DEF. Note that this boost will ignore all other changes to the monster's stats. No, you can't stack 2 Final Batle boosts on the same monster. 4) Protects all of your Subterror cards from being negated. Overall, a very solid card, searchable off of <strong>Guru</strong>, not once per turn, so setting multiple is not a problem.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>: Used for the Deskbot Combo. A viable target for <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> if you were to include it.  <strong>True King of All Calamities</strong>: <strong>VFD</strong> for short. Easily one of the best Rank 9 Xyz monsters in the entire game. Not sure if I should up him to 3, bring him down to 1, or leave him at 2. I'll have to keep testing.  <strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>: Similarly to <strong>VFD</strong>, a great Rank 9 considering the amount of level 9 monsters in the deck. It also allows you to summon monsters from your opponent's graveyard. It also has blanket protection that makes all of your monsters that were summoned from the GY untargetable.  <strong>Gallant Granite</strong>: Used for the Deskbot Combo, but could also search out <strong>Nibiru</strong> if necessary.  <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>: You probably already know what this card does. The Deskbot Combo provides 2 attributes (<strong>Halq</strong>/WATER and <strong>Auroradon</strong>/WIND). <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> and <strong>Phoenix</strong> may not be summoned every game, but they provide 2 more attributes (DARK &amp; FIRE). Lastly, <strong>Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</strong> is an EARTH monster, leaving only the LIGHT attribute, but we should not need 6 pops. Hopefully.  <strong>Halq &amp; Auroradon</strong>: Only purpose is the Deskbot Combo.  <strong>Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</strong>: Your typical go-to monster after using <strong>WL Monstrosity</strong>. Can advance your game state in more ways than one, unbricking your hand and retrieving resources.  <strong>Knightmare Phoenix &amp; Linkuriboh</strong>: Both are debatable, but I would like to test them a bit more before tossing them out.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Side Deck</strong></span>  The only things I would keep here are <strong>HFD</strong>, <strong>DRNM</strong>, <strong>Cosmic Cyclone</strong>, and <strong>TCBOO</strong>. The rest are all ideas and things I would like to put in the Main Deck; do not include them in your actual Side Deck.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Deskbot Combo</span></strong>  Like I mentioned earlier, I could just toss in something like <strong>Manju</strong> and call it a day, but where is the fun in that? Now while things like <strong>Manju</strong> and <strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> are things I would like to include, that will have to wait for another day. For now, here is a <strong>Deskbot 003</strong> Combo you can use instead: This Combo requires a singular <strong>Deskbot 003</strong> in your hand. You could also use <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> plus any other monster and make <strong>Halq</strong>, and you would get the same result. Opening a <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> is not a brick; opening 2 of them hurts, but if you can get one of them on the field with a different monster and summon <strong>Halq</strong>, you will be fine. So without further ado: <ol>  	<li> Normal Summon <strong>Deskbot 003</strong></li>  	<li> Special Summon <strong>Deskbot 001</strong></li>  	<li> Link Summon <strong>Halq</strong>, summoning your other <strong>Deskbot 001</strong></li>  	<li> Link Summon <strong>Auroradon</strong>, summoning 3 tokens and reviving both <strong>Deskbot 001s</strong></li>  	<li> Synchro Summon into 2 <strong>Heralds of the Arc Light</strong></li>  	<li> Overlay them into <strong>Gallant Granite</strong></li>  	<li> Activate <strong>Gallant Granite's</strong> effect, detaching a <strong>Herald</strong> and searching for <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong></li>  	<li> Activate <strong>Herald's</strong> effect, searching out a <strong>Tarotrei</strong></li>  	<li> Activate <strong>Auroradon's</strong> effect, tributing <strong>Gallant Granite</strong>, destroying either a card your opponent controls or your final token (just make sure <strong>Gallant Granite</strong> hits the GY)</li>  	<li> Activate the other <strong>Herald's</strong> effect, searching a <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong></li>  	<li> Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotrei</strong> using <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong></li>  	<li> During your End Phase, activate <strong>Tarotrei's</strong> effect to Special Summon the <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> from the GY or the Flip Monster of your choice</li> </ol> And now you have at the very least a <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, an <strong>Auroradon</strong>, and a Flip Monster of your choice (but if you did not have any, you could still bring back <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong>). But let's say you had even an ounce of luck with your <strong>Deskbot 003</strong>. If you have one of the following cards: <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>, <strong>Tarotrei</strong>, <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>, <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>, and/or <strong>Nekroz Kaledeiscope</strong>, you can go a step further a set up an active <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>, alongside everything else. So how does it work? So, I can't give you a run-down of every possible route, that would take too long. <strong>Nekroz Kaledeiscope</strong> allows you to use a monster from your Extra Deck as material for a Ritual Summon. The combo above only required 2 <strong>Heralds</strong>. Here is where the third comes into play. Focus your first 2 searches from the combo on getting the Nekroz cards. If you get them before the second <strong>Herald</strong> search, go ahead and start gathering the Prediction Princess duo. Ritual Summon <strong>Nekroz Unicore</strong>, sending your third and final <strong>Herald</strong> from your Extra Deck to the GY, and then activate its effect to search for your final piece of the Prediction Princess duo, and then summon her. Overall, its an enjoyable deck. We are in a combo format right now, where the top decks intend on ending the duel within the first 4 turns of the duel. Hopefully, the format slows down a bit with the December banlist (I doubt it). All suggestions are welcome and appreciated."

Pun intended.","Trains ALWAYS want to go second if you have the choice to. If you have to go first Dora is your best hope for survival with 4000 DEF and a protection quick-effect. <ul>  	<li>The Kaiju engine is to help break your opponents board by removing problem monsters and possibly getting you even more level 10 monsters on yours. Three Jizukiru and Gameciel to help the chances of opening one of them, and only 2 Slumbers because if you draw one Kaiju you would make the third Slumber a dead card in deck. One Kaiju card + Night Express Knight + Derricrane is usually enough for an OTK in most cases. Kaiju the problem, summon Express, Special Derricrane, XYZ into Gustav and burn for 2000. Then use Derricrane's effect to destroy the Kaiju, overlay into Liebe, activate effect to make ATK 6000 and punch for game.</li>  	<li>Dark Ruler is also a really good board breaker. Your opponent has a 15 negate board? Who cares!? Dark Ruler them then proceed to run over each of their monsters with Liebe because it can attack monsters up to the number of materials it has +1. This deck can easily spit out a 4 material Liebe to wipe an entire board. Dark Ruler + Slumber also clears boards super fast. You won't be able to OTK but you can at least set up your board to counter what they might do next turn.</li>  	<li>Switchyard is your bread and butter. Don't have the level 10 you need? Just pitch what you don't want and add what you do. Switchyard gets shut down hard by Ash Blossom, but that's where Triple Tactical Talents comes in. They Ash your search, and you say I'll draw 2 anyways, thanks. Switchyard + Pegasus +Bullet Train = 3 level 10s. Switchyard to pitch Bullet adding Derricrane. Summon Pegasus, activate effect to special Bullet from grave chaining Derricrane. If you already have those three monsters in hand, pitch Bullet to add Bullet, then do the combo again. Only this time you activate the second Bullet in hand for 4 level 10s. That's a Liebe and a Dora in one turn</li>  	<li>Urgent Schedule is one of the best cards in the deck. Special summon 2 monsters for free that triggers all of your other monsters and spells? Yes please. Depending how good or bad your hand is, you can easily end on a Liebe with Dora protection. Or, it'll save you during the battle phase by summoning two monsters to absorb some damage. The two best monsters to summon off this are Ruffian and Bullet Train because of their end phase effects to get the cards you need into your hand.</li>  	<li>Skill Drain is usually a sided card in most decks, especially in go second decks because of how slow it is to active it. But it has won me many a duel by making all my monsters giant beats sticks. All the big trains activate in hand and once they hit the field they usually lose attack damage or make you destroy stuff to attack, but with Skill Drain they stay big beaters and basically summon themselves for free.</li>  	<li>One funny combo I pull off once in a while happens when I have Switchyard on field, Urgent Schedule set, a level 10 in the grave, and a derricrane in hand. During your opponent's end phase activate Urgent Schedule to summon two monsters. Then, activate Switchyards effect to summon a level 4 and it becomes a level 10. Summon Pegasus, make it a 10, then activate Pegasus' effect to summon the level 10 from grave chaining Derricrane. Boom, 5 monsters summoned during your opponent's turn and they can't even Nibiru you. Proceed to make Dora first on your turn, then do your Gustav/Liebe combo without worry because of Dora's protection.</li>  	<li>The side deck is basically to help curb whatever is meta at the moment, with the exception of Summon Limit. Summon Limit is the only card I would never change in the side deck. Summon Limit is for when you know they are going to make you go first, or when you feel lucky and throw them off by saying you'll go first. Go first, make Dora, set Summon Limit, watch them die inside when you activate it on their second summon. After that, all you have to do is overlay Liebe as your one summon and proceed to beat everything down.</li> </ul>"

This is more so a stun and control based deck, using the Paleos to fuck wit the opponent as you swarm the field. Deck guide. 3x Swap Frog- graveyard setup and easy special summon, can also serve to get out more with an extra normal summon. great card 3x Dupe Frog- pops up and searches, you'll most likely link it away or something to get it's search off 3x Poison Draw Frog- also gives a nice draw when linked away or tributed for an effect, also doesn't have a once per turn on it's draw 3x Ronintoadin- Again, easy special summon for swarming 3x Treeborn Frog- Can special summon himself for swarming, although using him can be a bit inconsitent due to the Paleos 3x Tradetoad- Monster recovery and graveyard setup in one 3x Ash Blossom- just dont play lol 2x Ghost Ogre- helps to destroy strong shit that the frogs can't get over themselves 1x Foolish Burial- gy setup 1x Monster Reborn- Utilizes the GY for more swarming 3x Canadia- flips down a problem monster so it cant activate it's effects or anything, won't work on links but can still work on problem cards like Conducter Tyranno 3x Dinomischuis- GY setup with the discard and banishes a problem card 3x Marella- GY setup for the other Paleos, so you can set up easier 3x Olenoides- destroys backrow against problem decks like Eldlich 3x Pikai- Draw power and Gy setup, super underappreciated imo 3x Trap Trick- basically searches out your traps way easier if there's one you need but didn't open Extra deck 2x Toadally Awesome- Swarming, GY setup, and negations against decks like Eldlich. Great card 2x Opabinia- searches and allows you to activate Paeleoz from hand, which is amazing 2x Anomalocaris- GY setup, draw, and destruction for cards you can't just beat over 2x Linkurboh- can be linked into from Tradetoad or Treeborn frog, then links into secure gardna 2x Secure Gardna- links into from Linkuribo, helps to stun the opponent heavily 2x Apolousa- Great negates and all around great card 2x I;P masqureana- link up into Apolousa Playing guide The deck isn't super complex or anything, as it doesn't have any long winded combos. You want to set up a strong backrow of Paelos and swarm the field with frogs by dumping them and special summoning them, then going into either A) Toadally Awesome for a normal grind game or B) Apolousa to negate and wittle them down quicker. the Apolousa route takes much more resources but can wittle down the opponent quicker, and Toadally grinds slower and swarms much better but still takes less resources, so it's up to your opening hand and GY setup to which path you want to take. Afterwards, stun your opponent heavily with the Paleos and special summon them later to make more XYZ (or links), to stun your opponent and eventually OTK them. Note: you'll want to go first for the more control based focus of the deck, and the deck costs around 139 American dollars all together, not accounting for the side deck. Also, I think this deck might come into the spotlight more and maybe be a good rouge contender, although time will tell Any suggestions are appreciated. Have a good day"

You generally want to make Heatsoul + Conflict with Evil Twin Kiskil on the field and Lilla in the grave for your opponents turn. This often involves reviving Kisikil on your turn for a draw, and then linking the two into another Kisikil. If you have access to Challenge, you can make Knightmare Gryphon to floodgate your opponent or Unchained Abomination for more disruption, while still being able to revive the Twins on your opponents turn. Accesscode helps end games, and Saros Eresh Kurnugias can link off a hard to get rid of monster, as well as having some solid protection and negation.  This deck is also a work in progress, and I have various versions with different ratios or cards, such as Cynet Regression instead of Conflict, which does not rely on a Code Talker being on the field and doubles down on the ""pop-and-draw"" aspect of the Twins. One with 3 Code Generator and 1 Sea Archiver as a secondary target, for after Dotscaper has been expended, and one without Lilla Treat, because she wasn't revealed yet.  The deck has a pretty low ceiling, but I find it quite enjoyable. And if you have any questions regarding it, please ask, as my descriptions tend to be pretty basic."

Almost every hand is,"There are many more terrrors at sea than pirates and ghost ships, from the depths rise warmongering sea serpents, Fish-people and Sea-people. This is the place where you can see which fish in the seven seas work best together.  I will be covering each and every card / archetype used (Including the side this time), telling you all the info you need to know about this particular deck. I am going to be laying it out slightly differently this time, instead of doing it card by card (for the main deck) I will be doing them in archetypes / groups. If you have any questions about the deck please let me know :), I will not be going over their effects individually unless i deem it neccessary so please check out my 1st Decklist for that.  &nbsp;  <em>- Main Deck:</em> <strong>Atlanteans:</strong> The ""Atlantean"" engine I run is a 3:3:3 of &lt;Prince&gt;, &lt;Dragoon&gt; and &lt;Infantry&gt;. By this point you should already know what they do and why I am running 3 of them, however &lt;Infantry&gt; isn't usually played at 3 and that is what I shall use this section to explain. Running &lt;Infantry&gt; at 2 wasnt very bricky however I run out of Neptabyss targets super quickly at 2, running the 3rd just means I can use &lt;Neptabyss'&gt; effect an extra time before running out of targets. It also means I have an additional face-up pop. I can afford to put an extra copy of &lt;Infantry&gt; in the deck because I took most of the bricking cards out of the deck. The other 2 cards are staples to any ""Atlantean"" deck and I shouldn't have to explain why they are being played at 3 xD.  <strong>Mermails:</strong> Some people might be confused with my choice to run the Mermail engine at 3:1:1 as it is usualy run with 1 copy of &lt;Gunde&gt; aswell. I decided not to run the gunde as I would see it too often and never be able to use its effect at the right time, I would also like to see alot of other cards in the deck over this card. The other 3 cards are the same, &lt;Teus&gt; is a starter we want to see in our starting hand as much as possible, &lt;Pike&gt; and &lt;Megalo&gt; are searchable so they are played as 1 of's.  <strong>Deep Sea:</strong> I run both cards at 3 for a 3:3 ratio, technically both of these cards are starters for the deck with &lt;Diva&gt; being the primary NS of the deck and &lt;Minstrel&gt; being a ditcher for dragoons. I am running &lt;Minstrel&gt; at three because its so versatile: it deals with handtraps, has multiple ways of ditching ""Atlanteans"" and it can recur WATER monsters back from the GY to the deck with the primary target usually being &lt;Dragoons&gt;.  <strong>Frogs:</strong> Like the ""Mermail"" engine the ratios I am using may surprise some people. With a 2:1 ""Frog"" monster ratio the deck does not draw into them all that much, which is the idea. This strategy is great for both &lt;Toad&gt; plays and extending other WATER plays, however &lt;Swog&gt; doesn't activate the ditch effects of my""Atlantean"" cards and so it can cause issues with the starting hand. Regardless I have had great success running this ratio, but if you wish you could add another &lt;Swog&gt;.  <strong>Honourary AtlaMails: </strong>As is tradition I am running a 1:1 ration of &lt;Moulinglacia&gt; and &lt;Lappis&gt;. I shouldnt have to explain why but they are both searchable of dragoons. With &lt;Moulinglacia&gt; hand looping the ooponent and being a level 8 (Synchro plays)  he is great at gaining advantage over the opponent, Whilst lappis is Useful for rounds when you don't see &lt;Diva&gt; for the &lt;Halq&gt; plays.  <strong>Generic Water:</strong> A ratio of 2:1 is used to help make Synchro plays after first turn and extend combos. &lt;Spirit&gt; is an extender that can help make &lt;Bahamut&gt; or a Link monster.  <strong>Spells</strong>: For draw power I run a 3:2:1 ratio of &lt;Moray&gt;, &lt;Aria&gt; and &lt;Avarice&gt; respectively. &lt;Moray&gt; is a +0 card advantage but it cycles through the deck reliantly with the amount of Water monsters in the deck the only issue this card has is if you draw it as a top deck. &lt;Aria&gt; on the other hand is a great top deck and an amazing draw card as it allows you to add either &lt;Dragoons&gt; or &lt;Infantry&gt; depending on what is neccessary. It can also add &lt;Diva&gt; or &lt;Neptabyss&gt; but this isnt as good a search. I also use 1 &lt;Avarice&gt; which is useful for Longer grind games, it recurs &lt;neptabyss&gt; and other neccessary pieces. As a tech choice I run 1:1 of &lt;1 for 1&gt; and &lt;Instant Fusion&gt; as they extend the plays I can make or free up a NS. Instant fusion can be used both agressively and defensively in this deck dependant on which Fusion you summon. As Interuption I play 1 &lt;Called by&gt; and 3 &lt;Chalice&gt;. The 1 of is to add a 4th way of preventing the deck from being hand trapped and the 3 of is to stop your opponents plays. Now you may be wondering... ""Why is he using chalice, just use imperm!?"". &lt;Chalice&gt; is a BTEC imperm and it works really well, besides not being able to stop your opponents first turn play if you go 2nd it works the exact same way. In fact &lt;chalice&gt; is what comes out when Dark Ruler + Imperm have a card baby. It can be set and activated to stop opponent plays during their turn or if you are going second you can bait a negate / prevent an opponents monster from using its effects. &lt;Chalice&gt; is one of our SD targets, but I will get to that later...  <strong>Traps</strong>: Oh would you look at that... there aren't any xD  <em>-ExtraDeck:</em>  <strong>Fusions: </strong>&lt;TrishF&gt;, &lt;Mudragon&gt; and &lt;Restrict&gt; are all fantastic fusions for this deck all though it is unlikely you will summon 2 of them :( &lt;TrishF&gt; is an essential part of the &lt;VFD&gt; combo and can be reliably summoned on the 1st turn, his effects are useless to the deck but his lvl isn't. &lt;Muddragon&gt; Is the defensive side of &lt;Instant Fusion&gt; I was talking about earlier in the article. His effect prevents your monsters from being targeted by your opponent's effects and he is a level 4 so once he has finished protecting your monsters he can be linked or xyz'd off the board. &lt;restrict is &lt;Mudragons&gt; Offensivc counterpart to &lt;Instan Fusion&gt; and can be used to get rid of some pesky monsters on the field, because it is a level 1 it can be used to summon &lt;TrishS&gt; or &lt;TrishF&gt;.  <strong>Synchros: </strong>&lt;TrishS&gt;, &lt;Croc&gt;, &lt;Dragite&gt; and &lt;Whale&gt; all have their places in my deck as solid 1-of options. &lt;TrishS&gt; and &lt;Croc&gt; are both Lvl9 so they are used as material for &lt;VFD&gt; however &lt;Croc&gt; can also be summoned back by &lt;Coral&gt; making him a recursive destruction effect. &lt;Dragite&gt; is mostly only used against the decks that use pivotal spells, like Mystic Mine or Dream Mirror. as for &lt;Whale&gt; he only gets used every know and then to destroy your opponents field in one swoop.  <strong>Xyz's: </strong>&lt;VFD&gt;, &lt;Bahamut&gt; and &lt;Toad&gt; is what your first turn will look like most of the time. &lt;Vfd&gt; is made with either lvl9 Synchro and &lt;TrishF&gt; really easily. &lt;Toad&gt; is just as easily made with &lt;Bahamut&gt; as &lt;VFD&gt; is, it can also be made with the ""Frog"" engine.  <strong>Links: </strong>With only 4 Link monsters in the deck, they have to be good, and they are! &lt;Halq&gt; and &lt;Linkross&gt; are used to make &lt;VFD&gt; this is especiallyhelped by the tokens that &lt;Linkross&gt; creates. &lt;Coral&gt; is used for recursion and is an all round great Water support card. Lastly &lt;Alacia&gt; is summoned as a searcher for &lt;Teus&gt; for next turn, this can also disrupt the opponent if &lt;Infantry&gt; is ditched.  <em>- Side Deck:</em>  Forbidden Chalice / Aqua Spirit / Moulinglacia are the main deck cards that can be sided the easiest.  &lt;Kaiju&gt; - Side 3 of these cards in when (1) + (2): 1) your opponent has cards that are unaffected by your effects. 2) Your going 2nd &lt;Desert Locust&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) you know your going first &lt;Abyss Dweller&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) You are playing against a deck that relies on thee GY , Like BA. 2) Your going 1st  &lt;Raigeki&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) the deck your playing against spams the board. &lt;Feather Duster&gt; - Side this card in when: 1) your opponent is playing alot of spells. &lt;Dark Ruler&gt; - Side this card in when (1) + (2): 1) Your going 2nd. 2) your opponent builds a big board with lots of negates. &lt;Cosmic Cyclone&gt; - Side this card in when (1) + (2): 1) Your playing against a deck that is reliant on spells and traps. 2) you play against mystic mine. &lt;Mizuchi&gt; - Side this card in when (1) + (2): 1) Your opponent is going 2nd. 2) your opponent relies on non-continous / field spells  Please comment and suggest what things could be improved :P"

Unlimitied Pantheism makes Pot of Desires a viable option.","I used to be a big fan of this archetype, having invested a lot of time and love into building <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/dark-lockdown-monarchs/"">my own version</a> for a good couple of years, then stopped playing it during late 2018. That was the point where I realized that, even at full power, nothing but new support could ever bring the king of bricks back to their former glory; the meta is way faster, way more consistent, and with cards like <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> and <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> becoming the new powerful staples along <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> and <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> (which already gave Monarch players a pretty hard time to deal with), I'm confident that Domain Monarchs have been reduced to an archetype to play with, for fun, against your friends. That being said, since there's honestly no way to take consistent wins against more competitive decks, I decided to focus on making a build that is, at least, as consistent as it can get. You will still brick from time to time, it doesn't have a perfect search engine like other archetypes do, but at least you'll be able to do its main functions and get the feel that you're playing ""pure"" Monarchs.  &nbsp;  The main differences between this and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/dark-lockdown-monarchs/"">my previous build</a> are: <ol>  	<li>Having 3x copies of <strong>Pantheism</strong> allows for using <strong>Pot of Desires</strong> as a viable draw-card, without the danger of killing the only copy of the best card in the deck.</li>  	<li>Same goes for the <strong>Prime Monarch</strong>, where I have 2x copies this time around, which run better than 1x with an unlimited Pantheism, hence tribute fodder is better.</li>  	<li>Also, 3x copies of <strong>Ehther</strong> means easier to search, though running 6x lvl.8 Monarchs instead of 4x makes it slightly more dangerous to brick.</li>  	<li>Last but not least, running 2x copies of <strong>Majesty's</strong> instead of <strong>Vanity's</strong> suits <strong>Tenacity</strong> better, though I still believe that Tenacity is very occational and not that great of a card. Plus, the lack of <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong> opens slots for less Dark monsters, which is also a reason why I chose to run <strong>Mithra</strong> instead of <strong>Kaiser Vorse Raider</strong>; Pantheism and Desires bring more consistency, meaning you can more easily draw Monarchs and not rely on KVR's double nature.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  It's worth noting that I choose to main only 1x copy of <strong>Stormforth</strong>, as opening with even 1x when going first bricks hard. I save the remaining 2x copies for when going 2nd, while the rest of my Side Deck gives plenty of option to counter both monster-spams and spell/trap-spams."

Their main strategy is to disrupt the opponent's plays with cards like Infinite Impermanence, Paleozoic Canadia, Paleozoic Dinomischus,  and the Solemn series of counter traps. Using such a large amount of traps allows them to take advantage of the effects of the Paleozoic traps from the GY, which special summon them as level 2 aqua type monsters. This just so happens to coincide with Toadally Awesome's summoning conditions, which is a powerful negation card. However, there is a plethora of rank 2 XYZ monsters to take advantage of. Post Phantom Rage, the deck doesn't actually change much. I just wanted an excuse to post this. But, it does add the new TCG card, Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, which is an incredible piece of XYZ support. While being slightly situational, its ability to nuke the field effortlessly can't be ignored.  &nbsp;"

It's the Archfiend Guy Again :D </span>  <span>This deck is all about beatdown and stun! At its core, we summon high attack level 8 fiend monsters such as Archfiend Empress and Curse Necrofear, to help overwhelm your opponent with destruction effects and pure attack power. The Extra Deck in this build is mainly used as utility for the likes of Pot of Disparity, and Dogmatika Punishment, but we can also go into Rank 8s such as Dingirsu and Zombiestein (sometimes you just need a beater!).</span>  <span>There's plenty of cards to help mill and search, such as Dark Spirit's Mastery, Void Apocalypse, Foolish Burial, and Danger! Mothman. The Dark Spirit monsters help revive your fiends and maintain pressure, whereas cards such as Skill Drain, Gozen Match and Mystic Mine help render your opponent powerless.</span>  <span>Mystic Mine works very well with Archfiends, as they rely on destroying themselves. Therefore, you can pop cards on the field with monsters such as Archfiend Emperor, only for him to get destroyed as well, ensuring that you always have less monsters until you need to push for lethal!</span>  <span>In addition, we also run 3 copies of Successor Soul and 2 copies of Zoa to send monsters rather than destroy. Since Archfiend Emperor destroys himself, you can use his effect to pop cards, then send an additional card through Successor Soul and then rewarding your efforts with a 2600 beatstick!</span>  <span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/knVe6oSPUpc"">Check out the deck profile here</a></span>  <span>Enjoy, and until next time I'll see you around!</span>"

Hide-and-Seek, other than being Melffys favorite game, allows you to save your beast monsters from being destroyed by card effects the first time each turn. It also allows you to shuffle three beasts with different names into your deck from your GY and draw a card. <strong>Melffy of the Forest</strong> lets you search cards, but also allows you to cancel the effects of a summoned monster once per turn if it activates a Melffy's ability to go back to your hand. This is why you should always have at least one Melffy monster out at all times. (which is VERY easy to do!)  &nbsp;  The Melffys!:  You pretty much always want to have <strong>Melffy Puppy</strong> out. This lets you grab <strong>Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest, </strong>activating its ability to destroy a card on the field.  <strong>Melffy Catty</strong> lets you search cards you need to add to your hand. This very useful to grab a <strong>Rescue Cat</strong> or the Boss, <strong>Alpacaribou, Mystical Beast of the Forest.</strong>  <strong>Melffy Fenny</strong> lets you summon from your hand completing the combo to get out <strong>Alpacaribou</strong> or any other monster stuck in your hand.  <strong>Melffy Pony</strong> and <strong>Melffy Rabbi</strong> are mostly just fuel for <strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> or Xyz.  <strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> is interesting and can be utilized really well for direct damage, a wall or <strong>Melffy Playhouse</strong>.  &nbsp;  ...and Friends!:  <strong>Naturia Beast</strong> is what you will mostly use <strong>Rescue Cat</strong> for summoning <strong>Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> and either <strong>Mine Mole</strong> or <strong>Crusadia Leonis</strong> to syncro for <strong>Naturia Beast</strong> in one turn.  <strong>Nimble Beaver</strong> helps you get out your Xyz and I have subbed them for <strong>Amazoness Pet Baby Tiger</strong> which works better for <strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> (and keeps everyone EARTH)  <strong>Missus Radiant</strong> is your go to for Link summoning. The attack boost is a huge help and with the help of <strong>Scapegoat</strong> you can summon both at once for little effort!  <strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong> is a big help against foes with a lot attack power. It's tokens can fight the toughest boss monsters and with the help of <strong>Missus Radiant</strong>, <strong>Closed Forest</strong>, or <strong>Ayers rock Sunrise</strong> you can overtake them easily!  <strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> has a huge pocket that works sort of like a bag of holding. She likes to turn it inside out for a <strong>Dark Hole</strong> magic attack that, if <strong>Melffy Hide-and-Seek</strong> is active, only gets rid of your opponents monsters!  <strong>Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</strong> likes to wander into the forest every once in awhile, but mostly to chase random creatures around for fun  &nbsp;  I hope I covered everything! This deck is all about getting cards on and off the field and being cute and having fun! Though sometimes you need some protecting from the guardians of the forest.  NOTE: I just got <strong>Joyous Melffys</strong> and I haven't played with it yet, but wanted it in there anyway"

""Flamvell"" and its sub-archetypal ""Neo-Flamvell"" are a completely Fire-based group that almost exclusively consists out of monsters. The archetype is often seen as the alpha version of ""Laval"", who just so happened to be able to use their main playmaker in form of ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" as much as ""Flamvell"" could. Strategy-wise, the monsters feature a mix of Special Summoning, burn damage and beatdown-/battle-focussed effects, but the overall age of the archetype(s) is clear for anyone to see. ""Flamvells"" was one of the first archetypes to receive Synchro monsters, showcasing how old the archetype actually is, and the loose group of members really does not have that many similar factors and strategies to work with in unison. Nonetheless, I tried to build something with them and I feel like the deck at least tries to make the best out of what the archetype has to offer.</p> <p>One cannot talk about ""Flamvell"" without mentioning ""<a data-name=""Flamvell Firedog"">Flamvell Firedog</a>"". This 1900 ATK critter can summon monsters from the deck if it manages to destroy something in battle, which is rather mediocre from a modern standpoint but really one of the best cards the archetype has to offer. Together with the other key card in the deck, ""<a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a>"", you can actually manage to summon Synchro and Link monsters in turn one, despite the fact that ""Flamvells"" are terribly slow. ""<a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a>"" also has the huge benefit of having 200 DEF and therefore being revivable via ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"", and as an added bonus it even heals your life points when Special summoned, giving the deck an odd amount of survivability in certain situations. ""<a data-name=""Neo-Flamvell Lady"">Neo-Flamvell Lady</a>"" is the newest support card and brings disruption and graveyard setup, both well received in the archetype. The single copy of ""<a data-name=""Flamvell Archer"">Flamvell Archer</a>"" serves both as a Level 3 Tuner monster, as well as a potential ATK boost after a ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" play. The last archetypal monster in the Main Deck is ""<a data-name=""Neo-Flamvell Origin"">Neo-Flamvell Origin</a>"", who can technically serve as further swarming, just in a fairly limited amount of scenarios.</p> <p>This alone does not make the deck though: I added two copies of ""<a data-name=""Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner"">Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner</a>"" and two copies ""<a data-name=""Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag"">Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag</a>"" to the deck; the first one provides a small amount of burn damage while being a sizeable beatstick that can summon itself when you lose resources, while ""<a data-name=""Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag"">Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag</a>"" is a big beater that can enter the field rather easily by getting rid of opposing Extra Deck monsters. The two copies of ""<a data-name=""Volcanic Shell"">Volcanic Shell</a>"" are just there to be ditched via ""<a data-name=""Neo-Flamvell Lady"">Neo-Flamvell Lady</a>"", but they do provide further deck thinning and a card to discard if necessary. Lastly, the ""<a data-name=""Guerilla Kite"">Guerilla Kite</a>"" might seem odd, but it is one of the few Level 4 Fire Tuners in the game, has more attack than ""<a data-name=""Flamvell Magician"">Flamvell Magician</a>"", the necessary 200 DEF for ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" revives and a small burn damage to edge you closer to OTKable life point numbers.</p> <p>The backrow consists entirely of Spell cards in order to make the deck run smoother and faster. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a>"" are there to make sure that you can pull the summoning of two monsters turn one off, two ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" are reasonably priced draw options, ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" is another swarming tool, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" can fetch stuff back for attacks and Extra Deck summons, while ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" all destroy opposing cards that you might struggle with. The main star of the show are the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"", which can turn the deck from a weak pile of cards into an actual thread, either by kicking for enough damage to allow for an OTK or by using the summoned monsters for various Extra Deck shenanigans to gain board control that way. To allow ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" to work at full potential, there are also options like ""<a data-name=""Slash Draw"">Slash Draw</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>"" which all fill the graveyard with revivable monster cards.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features a number of options to either get rid of certain threats on the opposing side of the field or to support the Extra Deck summon chain after the successful ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" play. For the former there are ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Salamangreat Heatleo"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"", all taking care of certain threats that might come up. For the swarming, there are three copies of ""<a data-name=""Duelittle Chimera"">Duelittle Chimera</a>"", which I previously ran at a lower copy count but I found that summoning all three is actually possible and sometimes even very helpful. ""<a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>"" can transform pretty much any monster into more helpful option, while the new ""<a data-name=""Infernity Doom Archfiend"">Infernity Doom Archfiend</a>"" can become a pretty solid beater/destruction option if you play your cards right.</p> <p>It has to be said that this is not a competitively viable deck as ""Flamvell"" is a rather lackluster archetype; in fact, I would say that they do not get even close to anything meta-related in terms of power level or consistency. However, for Casual rounds this deck should perform just fine and it was in all honesty the maximum I thought there was to get out of the archetype without simply throwing lots of money cards at it. If you are interested in the archetype and might even want to try giving your own ""Flamvell"" deck a spin, I invite you to look at my ""Flamvell"" analysis on my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/03/archetype-analysis-neo-flamvell/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/03/archetype-analysis-neo-flamvell/</a></p>"

Some of these effects include bouncing, negating or destroying backrow. Also be sure to bait out any negates and think of a backup plan before trying to break the whole board.  Side deck is subject to change. You can play whatever you want in it, really."

I have ran 3 before, I decided I prefer them at 2.  It opens up <em>more plays</em> for me and makes space for my extremely important backrow removal.  MST is a great spell. It's a quick spell with no costs, and has a classic feeling. Twin Twisters require discarding, and Cosmic Cyclone requires you to pay 1000 LP to banish. The discarding effect is great, it puts things in my graveyard, but I need a hand to play with. I don't run more than 1 TT. and I haven't come across a spell/trap that I so badly needed to banish. Destroying it is enough. Presumably there won't be another turn for your opponent to use the effect of whatever spell/trap you destroyed.  I main deck Sphere Mode of Ra, Kaiju, and Zoo King Alpha because, why not? why should I have to lose game 1 to bring them in for game 2? Why can't I win game 1 with the help of Kaiju? Why must I lose that first game to Dragun, Infinity, Borreload and Apollousa? or to UCT, Laggia, VFD and Wind Barrier Statue?  I don't have to. I can run whatever removal I need in my main deck. I don't need a whole entire 40 card archetype in my deck. I only need about 18 - 20 Lunalight cards,  10 utility cards, and the other stuff can be anything. I prefer backrow removal and things to deal with monsters. You bait an effect here, bait an effect there, Kaiju this, negate that, and proceed with your play.  &nbsp;  Now that that's out the way, onto the strategy :  I prefer to search Tenki via Tiger King's effect. Tiger King is good for 2 reasons :  1 . Searches your Beast-Warriors.  2 . Negates the effects of all non Beast-Warriors.  In other words, your opponent will be forced to negate if they want to protect their monsters.  You <em>can</em> OTK without normal summoning, it is possible and I have done it. It's why I main deck Sphere Mode of Ra.  I don't <em>need</em> that normal summon to pull it off. and then Tiger King will just negate Sphere Mode, so you can attack it for game.  <em>**Dark World Dealings triggers your Lunalight monster's effects.</em>  Do NOT use Lunalight Fusion as your main fusion card.  Lunalight Fusion uses a MATERIAL from the DECK, use it to SETUP your GRAVEYARD.  Do NOT miss out on a play because you used Lunalight Fusion to summon Sabre Dancer.  Lunalight Fusion triggers the effects of your Lunalight monsters. So send Emerald Bird from your deck to activate her effect to summon one Lunalight (only Kaleido Chick is worth this summon) from the graveyard or banished zone.  Or use it to send Yellow Marten to activate her effect to add a Lunalight trap from your deck to your hand.  This trap can be discarded a million different ways.  <em>**Psst, The only way you should be fusion summoning is through Wolf.</em>  Why Wolf? Because Wolf BANISHES your KALEIDO CHICK, which has an effect that ACTIVATES when she is BANISHED.  This effect reads :<em> "" If this card is banished: You can activate this effect; this turn, your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated during the Battle Phase.""</em>  <em>*Drops the mic*</em>  <em>*And his Diet Coke*</em>  Only go for game if you banish Kaleido Chick, otherwise don't risk attacking. It's a One Turn Kill. Not Dogmatika Invoked Shaddoll.  Go for the One Turn Kill <em><span><span>if and only if</span></span></em> you banish Kaleido Chick.  Thy Goal : To get Leo out as soon as possible AND secure the OTK.  Steps To Achieve Thy Goal :  1 . Protect yourself first. Use the Kaijus and Droplets to protect yourself from getting negated. This deck can bait and deal with negates pretty well, but realistically no one is surviving 7 interruptions. USE the mf'ing Kaijus and Zoo King Alpha and Sphere Mode to protect yourself from threats.  2 . Get Kaleido Chick in Hand, Field and/or Graveyard ASAP. The more the merrier.  3 . Get Wolf in Hand or Graveyard (Field is OK too but you will need to use Yellow Marten to put him back in your hand. Least optimal scenario)  4 . Have some way to Special Summon Blue Cat, either from Hand or from Graveyard. Blue Cat will double Leo's original attack.  5 . (Optional) After you're done and have successfully brought Leo's ATK points to 7000 and have checked off everything in the list, Link into the Link 4 Tribrigade monster to banish something off the field. Bonus points for banishing Dragun.  6 . Attack and say GGWP. Remember to be humble and respect your opponent.  &nbsp;"

First step is to get Curse Necrofear into the graveyard, there are multiple ways to do this:  1. Summon Tour Guide From the Underworld &amp; use her effect to summon Fiendish Rhino Warrior, go into Link or XYZ play &amp; send Fiendish Rhino Warrior to the graveyard &amp; use his effeck to send Curse Necrofear to the graveyard, you can also send one of the Drak Spirit's there if you use Cherubini.  2. Use Foolish Burial to send Fiendish Rhino Warrior the the graveyard &amp; then use his effect to send Curse Necrofear there.  3. Use Trade in to send Curse Necrofear to the graveyard.  Dark Sanctuary &amp; Battle Fader are the deck's stall cards, after you summon Battle Fader, if you have Destiny Board/Spirit Message's &amp; Sentence of Doom set up, get rid of it &amp; use Sentance of Doom's effect to return it. Terraforming &amp; Metaverse will help you get it.  Even if Destiny Board gets destroyed you can use Dark Spirit's Mastery's graveyard effect to send them back to the Deck &amp; draw more cards potentially going +4 also &amp; it's probably better your opponent waste's their resources trying to stop Destiny Board, it you do manage to get Destiny Board &amp; 3 of the other Spirit messages use Sentence of Doom to place the last one &amp; win the Duel.  Finally there's Curse Necrofear &amp; Dark Necrofear, use the Dark Spirits effects to summon Curse Necrofear from the graveyard &amp; preferably get it destroyed if you have face up spell &amp; trap cards at the end of the turn it will return potentially destroy up to 5 of the opponents cards. Dark Necrofear needs to be summoned properly first by banishing 3 fiend type monsters, but you should have no trouble getting fiend type monsters into the graveyard &amp; you can use Sentence of Doom or Curse Necrofear summoning condition to retrieve them. if both of them get destroyed on the same you can take control of on of the opponent's monsters and destroy a card on their field since Dark Necrofear counts as a spell when equipped to an opponent's monster. When either of them get destroyed use the Dark Spirit's graveyard effects to add the to your hand allowing you to summon them again."

This deck has several different ways to get to its end board, so there is no one specific combo to get there. But I'll try to explain the kind of route you'd want to take. <ul>  	<li>In most cases you want to try to get Striker Dragon out as soon as possible with Rokket Tracer either in hand or GY, the preferred way to do this is by using Chaos Space or Quick Launch.</li>  	<li>Search Boot Sector Launch with Striker Dragon, and if Tracer is in the GY use Strikers effect to get Tracer to the hand.</li>  	<li>Use Boot Sector Launch to special summon Tracer. Then you can use Tracer together with any extender to go into Halqifibrax, then use Halqifibrax's effect to summon out Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Link Halqifibrax into Linkross and summon 2 tokens with it's effect. Then synchro summon Martial Metal Marcher using Plague spreader and one of the tokens. You can use Martial's effect to summon Tracer back out again. With this you already have the setup for Herald of the Arc Light and have a lv4 tuner ready for Borreload Savage Dragon.</li> </ul> From this point it's all dependend on which extenders you opened with or were able to get throughout making combo's.  If you have Necroworld Banshee in the graveyard or Zombie World in hand, you could revive Plaguespreader through his effect, activate Zombie World and use Plaguespreader and Linkross to go into Union Carrier for the Dragon Buster.  When you get stuck but you are able to go into a lv8 synchro there is the possibility to go into Chaos Ruler to mill some cards and get a new card in hand. It's risky but can help you out, additionally Chaos Ruler can be used as an extender through his floating effect.  I know it's not really the most helpful explaination but I hope you'll get the basic gist of this deck and have fun playing around with it."

Linkuribohs are good for <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, it's also good to have 2, because then you can link <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and draw a card with its effect for example when you have 3 token's with the same name with <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a>, <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, <a data-name=""Pot Of Disparity"">Pot Of Disparity</a> - The draw engine, it is dependent on stalling cards which is why there are defensive spell and trap cards together with the Amazoness Cards, <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> gets triggered when any monster or Token gets destroyed by battle or card effects, but only once per turn, so you don't want more than one monster to get destroyed per turn if it's possible. <a data-name=""Pot Of Disparity"">Pot Of Disparity</a> is better than <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, because then you can use the Link monsters more effectively, if you banish cards you can banish the backup-cards, 1 <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> because it needs 2 different names as monsters, <a data-name=""Soul of Silvermountain"">Soul of Silvermountain</a>, <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys"">Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</a> and <a data-name=""Ascension Sky Dragon"">Ascension Sky Dragon</a>  <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, <a data-name=""My Body as a Shield"">My Body As A Shield</a>, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> - Strong defensive cards to get tokens and to support the Amazoness-engine and the Draw-engine.  &nbsp;  Traps:  <a data-name=""Statue of Anguish Pattern"">Statue of Anguish Pattern, </a><a data-name=""Shapesister"">Shapesister</a> - A defensive card that maybe triggers <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, it is a Rock-card, so you can also special summon <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> with it. With <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> <a data-name=""Shapesister"">Shapesister</a> is a great card, this way you can get a fast <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> for more negations as a support, it also can maybe trigger the destroy-effect of <a data-name=""Statue of Anguish Pattern"">Statue of Anguish Pattern</a>.  <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> - If you special summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> with it you can search for another Amazoness card from the deck, and if you summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>, your Amazoness-monster-cards get undestroyable.  <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a>- The strongest trap card, because you can banish every monster you attack with Amazoness cards, works best with undestroyable Amazones-monster-cards with <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>. You can also summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> or other Amazoness-monster-cards from the hand with it.  <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>, <a data-name=""Graveyard of wandering souls"">Graveyard of wandering souls</a>, <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a> - Supportive Trap cards that support the token-engine and also the draw-engine with <a data-name=""Graveyard of wandering souls"">Graveyard of wandering souls</a>."

So here it is, in all of it's degenerate glory. (Yes it runs Mystic Mine, don't whine about degeneracy in the comments, just run Cosmic Cyclone bro) Deck list 3x Stained Greaves- can chain onto a Boots to make a Bardiche, and can  special summon a monster from the Grave. great card 3x Ragged Gloves- pretty good starter that can buff a Break Sword to make ranking it up into Zeus easier, and can search a Boots, albeit through a complicated matter that Ash or Lock Bird adores to negate. 3x Anchient Cloak- Can be a shitty garnet but, I run at 3 because of how good it's search it. Can be a simple normal summon to use Boots or Kage on though, if you're in a tight spot 3x Torn Scales- Graveyard setup galore, which leads to searching more Boots and Fog Blades. 1x Snake boy- can't spell the name but, he's a good boy which leads to a free monster and either a draw or GY setup, or both. great card 1x Jackalope- see above 3x Kagemucha- leads to much easier XYZ in brickier hands, if you dont have a boots or something like it 3x Mystic Mine- seriously slows down the opponent and the game in general to a level that this deck likes, and then gets eradicated by Zeus 1x Terraforming- searches mystic mine lol 3x Fog Blade- easily stuns an opponent's big monster if you dont have a Mystic or if your Mystic's been eradicated. 3x Sword- Buffs your Bardiche if you leave it on the field, because im really paranoid about Bardiche being run over. 3x Mist Claws- recovers the banished PK's, to make more XYZ after you use their searches and shit that they banish themselves for 3x Fiendish Chain- does the same thing as Fog Blade 3x Trap Trick- searches a lot of your good trap's like Fog Blade that you need 3x Metaverse- same thing as Terra, just worse Extra deck list 3x Break Sword- the first monster you want to make so you can destroy cards and attack to rank up into Zeus 3x Dante- 2nd in command if all Break Sword copies are gone 3x Leviar- Good for late game recovery of resources 3x Zeus- The boss monster, really- rank it up from Break Sword and wreak havoc. 1x Bardiche- Nice option if you have a ton of dark monsters on the field and can afford to make one 1x Megaclops- good for grindier, slower games, where you might make 3 XYZ. very situational though 1x Knightmare Gryphon- good resource recovery late game Playing guide Like the original PK build I made, this isn't super complex or anything. You set up a strong backrow and Mystic Mine and then start building up an XYZ by getting out enough monsters with effects like Kage and Boots, overlay into Break Sword. Then you use Break Sword's effect to set up your graveyard and pop one of your backrows to pop the opponent's boss monster (if possible). Then you go into the battle phase, and attack with what should be a 3k Break Sword if you got Glove's boost. Afterwards, go into Main Phase 2 and rank up into Zeus. Then you wait for the opponent's turn, wipe everything they work for. Go into your turn, make more XYZ, set up more backrow if possible (don't set up another Mystic Mine, you want to just use it in the first time to slow the opponent), then wittle them down little by little as you basically Evenly Matched them with Zeus, until you eventually finish them off. (Note: Go second for this, and if your Zeus rank up gets negated/destroyed, stall the opponent with Mine and Fog Blade and Chain until you can make another Zeus, then go about the strategy i entailed above. Also, if your opponent is running heavy Mystic Mine hate, I reccomend siding it in favor of Pot of Desires and that one floodgate trap that  makes it so you cant activate spells.) Like normal, any suggestions are appeciated. Have a good day. Also, fun fact: A dude tried to fuse my Bardiche while I was in the middle of my effect when I was play testing this, then started spamming slurs when I said he couldn't do that"

We’re hosting the first in a series of tournaments this month The Winter Revel, with a set of custom deck building restrictions to encourage a more archetypal style of play. Check us out <a>here</a> if you’re interested.  So lately I find myself worn out by the deck building constraints of the current meta. As of now PHRA has failed to oust the top decks like Infernoble or Dragonlink from Tier One. Zoodiac have taken over the lower tiers with help from the Dogmatika engine and Divine Arsenal AA ZEUS – Sky Thunder. This has left many of my favourite decks high and dry at the lower tables; simply incapable of climbing the ladder. Luckily for anyone in this position there have been a number of smaller casual tournaments as of late with more yet to come as November unfolds. One of these encouraged me to build a new deck so I decided to revisit an old favourite: Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon. Now the title might be confusing to some, to clarify<em><u> this build does not include Chaos Max.</u></em> Now that’s out of the way this build does include a variety of level eight monsters and a small Lightsworn engine to assist with setup. All of this is tied together with a rank eight extra deck of Hope Harbinger and Draglubion plus its targets of Numbers 100 &amp; 99. This gives us a variety of options going first or second for both control or OTK lines. Join me below as I breakdown my deck building choices and a selection of effective lines. <ol start=""2"">  	<li><strong> Main Deck: Dragons, Birds, and Bigfoots Oh My</strong></li> </ol> <u><strong>Main </strong></u><u><strong>D</strong></u><u><strong>eck Monsters</strong></u>  <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon x 3</strong>  We start our look at the maindeck with one of the most iconic monsters in Yu-Gi-Oh history Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Famously used by Kaiba throughout the Duel Monsters arc of the anime and nearly every spin-off the character appears in. As far as Blue-Eyes goes in this build we’re mostly using it as a resource to fuel our draw engine and as extension from the grave with cards like Master with Eyes of Blue. To this end it’s fantastic as we have numerous ways to set-up and pay-off our engine like Raiden and Alternative White Dragon. Even Blue-Eyes's attribute comes in handy for extending with Levianeer. Overall while I wouldn’t run less of this as its the core resource of this build, two could be an option if you’re cutting down on Trade In in favour of other draw spells.  &nbsp;  <strong>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon x 1</strong>  Another iconic anime monster next with Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Used by Atticus in his final duel against Jaden in the GX arc of the anime to limited effect, Darkness Metal Dragon’s diminutive performance isn’t reflective of it’s storied competitive success. Red-Eyes Darkness Metal has had top-cut appearances starting all the way back in 2010 and continuing all the way to this year with ten top eight appearances despite the current state of in-person play. Its performance is due to this card’s effects that allows us to first summon it from the hand by banishing a face up dragon from our side of the field before summoning any dragon from the hand or grave. It’s due to the ease of summoning and generic tribal extension that this card finds itself on the limited list. Due to this we can only play one copy although if it ever comes off the list we’ll be playing more.  <strong>Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon x 1</strong>  A rather new addition here with the retrain of this deck’s namesake Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon. Most players should be familiar with the original Chaos Emperor Dragon, Envoy of the End as it was an early format-warper back in the aptly named Chaos format. The retrain was released to the public this year in Battles of Legends: Armageddon to much hype as it had already seen some competitive success, appearing in twelve topping decks since 2018. We play it here to help with setup on the play in niche hands and to assist with board clearing going second. It can even be used as an explosive finisher due to its board-wipe dealing 300 damage for each card sent to your opponent’s grave by its effect. One could play this in multiples although without greater focus on Pendulum or Guardragon combos I find it to be bricky in the hand.  <strong>Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon x 3</strong>  Next up is the card responsible for Blue-Eyes’s World Championship win in 2016 Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon. Used to great effect by Shunsuke Hiyama Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon is arguably the decks most powerful card, then and now. Between its essentially free summoning condition to its targeted pop Alternative almost always pluses while allowing us to climb into our rank eight package. We can search for Alternative a couple ways, optimally through Melody of Awakening Dragon but Chaos Space is also an option. This together is why I choose to play three Alternative, although it could be cut to two if you’re using a different rank eight engine.  <strong>Danger! Bigfoot! x 3</strong>  Onto another level eight extender; Danger! Bigfoot! Provides a similar set of benefits to the aforementioned Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon. As with all Danger! monsters Bigfoot allows us to reveal him in hand before our opponents discards a random card from our hand. If that card wasn’t Bigfoot he can then be special summoned from the hand, drawing us a card in the process. If Bigfoot was discarded we can target and pop an opponents face up card. Aside from that Bigfoot is our primary discard with Chaos Space in situations we need Alternative and don’t have Melody. Much like Alternative Bigfoot almost always pluses us while allowing for easy access to Draglubion or Hope Harbinger, hence why we play three. You can cut this in favour of other rank eight engines — Schwarzschild Limit Dragon comes to mind if you value more tribal synergy with Blue-Eyes.  <strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer x 2</strong>  The second of our eponymous Chaos Dragons, Levianeer is a powerful extender or board clear in the right circumstances. Searchable off of Chaos Space, we have a good chance (<strong>50%</strong> going first,<strong> 57%</strong> going second) of opening Levianeer anytime we need it. More often than not its a fantastic going second play to clear problem cards from field or climb into Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon for the OTK. Due to a lack of dark attribute monsters it can sometimes be hard to get the hand-looping effect off going first but that’s not the focus of this build. If you value it more a number of dark engines could be used to increase the likelihood of resolving it. In that case I’d recommend playing three along with the dark Warrior engine and Summoner Monk to assist in seeing them more often.  <strong>Danger! Thunderbird! x 1</strong>  Our last Danger! Monster, Thunderbird is mostly here to up our chances of opening a Danger! monster. With three copies Bigfoot and one of Thunderbird we have a<strong> 42%</strong> chance to open either one going first. This is important for consistently getting our rank eight onto the board going first, although Thunderbird has utility going second as well. This is thanks to its discard effect as like Bigfoot when this card is discarded you can target and destroy one card, this time a set card instead of a face up card. Mostly we use this to clean up problem back-row like Dogmatika Punishment or the ever-popular Mystic Mine. I’ve experimented with playing two or three of these as well as an extra Danger! Monster in Danger! Ogopogo! to assist with our rank eight game plan. This is a valid choice although it tended towards bricking in my testing.  <strong>Dragon Spirit of White x 1</strong>  Now we look at another Blue-Eyes favourite Dragon Spirit of White. We play it here mostly as a fourth copy of Blue-Eyes White Dragon for the purpose of our search and draw spells. Aside from that its also useful with Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon’s stand-by phase effect as a banish of any spell or trap your opponent controls. We can also trigger the banish proactively with Return of the Dragon Lords should you need to. I didn’t find playing more than one necessary due to how searchable this is but two could be warranted in a more Blue-Eyes focused build.  <strong>Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn x 3</strong>  Finally we reach our normal summon of choice Raiden, the Hand of the Lightsworn. He’s well known these days due to a brief stint this year in the short-lived Lightsworn Eldlich as its normal summon of choice. We play him for much the same reason as he lets us mill a total of four cards over the course of a turn. We can use this to further our Chaos plays or set-up Blue-Eyes combos with the aforementioned Return of the Dragon Lords or Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon respectively. The fact that he’s a tuner also gives us a great followup line into Accesscode talker on the draw. I did briefly experiment with other starters like Mekk-Knight Orcust Girsu for lines into True King of all Calamities or the old Blue-Eyes staple Sage with Eyes of Blue but neither preformed as well as Raiden. If you dislike this choice feel free to try any other options you like.  <strong>The White Stone of Ancients x 2</strong>  Next up is another of our tuners: The White Stone of Ancients a favourite of the 2016 Blue-Eyes lists. In their lists this was played as the primary tuner for lines into Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon and as a search through its grave effect. In this build we play it more for the latter although there are Halqifibrax lines that can still make Spirit if necessary. We have a number of ways to get White Stone of Ancients in the grave — ideally we’ll be using Cards of Consonance but Foolish Burial or Melody of Awakening Dragon will do. I sacrificed playing three of these in favour of a single Master with Eyes of Blue for followup plays but if you’d prefer you can play the extra copy.  <strong>Master with Eyes of Blue x 1</strong>  As I mentioned above I sacrificed an extra copy of White Stone of Ancients in favour of this. Master with Eyes of Blue helps with unbricking certain niche hands and making Spirit Dragon or Accesscode Talker on the followup. This is aided by the same Foolish Burial and Melody of Awakening Dragon mentioned above. Once he’s in the grave we can make use of his effect or attribute for extending our plays, but my favourite is to resurrect him with Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians for an easy Accesscode Talker. This lets us close out games quickly but if you value the boosted consistency of an extra White Stone of Ancients go for it.  <strong>The White Stone of Legends x 1</strong>  Finally our last maindeck monster and tuner all-in-one The White Stone of Legends. It’s played for its ability to search a Blue-Eyes when it’s sent to the grave and its tuner status as its an alternate Halqifibrax target if we’ve banished both of our White Stone of Ancients. Like all the level one tuners we can also normal summon it and link it off for Linkuriboh or Relinquished Anima if we have no other way to get the search. You could definitely cut this but it would come at the price of less Foolish targets and searching.  <u><strong>Spells </strong></u>  &nbsp;  <strong>Return of the Dragon Lords x 2</strong>  We start off the spells and traps with Return of the Dragon Lords, essentially a tribal Monster Reborn for dragons. This allows us to convert a lot of the set-up Raiden provides into extension towards our rank eight payoff. It also has a secondary graveyard effect that can prevent our dragon monsters from being destroyed by battle or card effect. This is obviously relevant to any lines that end on Spirit Dragon or Draglubion/Hope Harbinger as it allows us to preserve their field presence and inherent negates for more ideal targets. Three of these tended to brick in testing although if you choose to play an increased Blue-Eyes package that will likely change.  <strong>Trade-</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>n x 3</strong>  Our first of several draw or search spells starting with the most ubiquitous. Trade-In is an iconic Blue-Eyes staple since its release in the Rise of the Dragon Lords Structure Deck as a common of all rarities. While it has a place in any rank eight strategy Trade-In is especially welcome here for setting up our Blue-Eyes and Chaos Dragon plays respectively. This is the reason I choose to play three here. Ideally we see it with Melody of Awakening Dragon for the maximum possible set-up. It would be pertinent to switch this up in-line with whatever your normal summon of choice is however I still think three copies is warranted for consistency.  <strong>Cards of Consonance x 1</strong>  Another draw spell and counter-point to Trade-In, Cards of Consonance is a powerful option for Blue-Eyes decks since its release in 2010. With that said you may be wondering why I’ve only chosen to play one, reason being due to a lack of targets. Since we’re playing a total of three targets one copy of Consonance is all we need due to how rarely it’ll be live in our opener. At<strong> 33%</strong> to open any one of our dragon tuners one is enough to ensure we can resolve it anytime we need it, however rare those might be. You could play One for One instead if you value the synchro lines over the XYZs lines but I find the synchro to be kind of underwhelming as a going first option compared to Draglubion.  <strong>The Melody of Awakening Dragon x 3</strong>  Now to look at our first of three search spells we play, The Melody of Awakening Dragon. Melody allows us to discard any card to search two dragons with 3000 or more attack and 2500 or less defence. This is of course Blue-Eyes White Dragon’s exact stat line for convenient access to Alternative and Dragon Spirit of White for example. As luck would have it we can also search Levianeer for followup hands requiring more than a single pop. The synergy is at a point where we can often go plus three or four off of a single copy plus discard. We play it at three because of this as the searching and setup are too good to pass up in my view.  <strong>Foolish Burial x 1</strong>  Another setup tool and one that I’m very fond of playing, Foolish Burial. Released in the same structure deck as Trade-In, Foolish Burial is powerful enough to be on the limited list at time of writing. For those who are new to the game Foolish Burial allows us to send one card from the deck to the graveyard, an effect so ubiquitous most players, myself included refer to any effect that sends monsters from deck to grave as a Foolish. We play Foolish here to do a number of things from assisting with setting up Blue-Eyes and Chaos Dragon plays to searching us fodder for Trade-In. If I had the chance to play more copies I would so bear that in mind for future builds.  <strong>Charge of the Light Brigade x 1</strong>  Next up is a powerful searcher for our normal summon that doubles as an explosive set-up piece in specific hands. Charge of the Light Brigade mills three from the top of the deck and adds a level four or lower Lightsworn monster from the deck to the hand. This allows us to mill a total of five cards if both this and Raiden go off uninterrupted which can produce some truly ridiculous combos depending on what you mill. Now astute readers might be wondering why I haven’t chose to prioritize this set-up combo by playing more copies of Charge instead of the three Raiden mentioned above. The reason is two-fold, firstly the number of handtraps being played even causally today makes it unlikely that both of Charge and Raiden will resolve. Secondly the extra copies of Raiden are useful for followup plays into Accesscode Talker whereas the extra copies of Charge of the Light Brigade are useless after the first turn. If you’d prefer more copies of Charge I would recommend switching focus away from Accesscode lines on the followup to something like Borrelsword and I:P Masquerena instead.  <strong>Chaos Space x 3</strong>  The last of our searchers and the newest by far, Chaos Space is a boon to all Chaos strategies. Released earlier this year in Toon Chaos, Chaos Space has featured in a number of top tier strategies including both versions of Dragon Link. This popularity is due to its incredibly versatile searching effect that allows us to discard a light or dark attribute monster in order to search a level four to eight monster with the opposite attribute from the deck. Beyond this when it’s in the graveyard Chaos Space allows us to banish it to target a banished light or dark monster that cannot be normal summoned or set before placing it on the bottom of the deck and drawing a card. The first effect can search almost any monster in the deck short the tuners with the correct discard while also setting up our Chaos plays with the discard and recurring our resources with the grave effect. It should be obvious at this point why we play three of these and personally I wouldn’t recommend cutting any regardless of the build.  <strong>Emergency Teleport x 1</strong>  Finally we’ll look at the last spell card, Emergency Teleport. Famously released in same set as Charge of the Light Brigade, The Duelist Genesis ushered in a new era for the established DAD Returns deck. TeleDAD would go on to define an entire format as one of the game’s most famous tier zero decks in Yu-Gi-Oh’s history. Emergency Teleport has seen widespread play long after the decline of DAD as a strategy in decks from Kozmo to Synchron Eldlich builds earlier this year. It’s mostly played these days as an extender for any deck trying to make Halqifibrax and this build is no different. Our target of choice is Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit both for its tuner status and light attribute which lets us set up our Chaos plays while also climbing into our synchros though Halqifibrax. In a spot it can even be an additional copy of Ogre if you’re desperate for interaction as her effect can be activated from the hand or field. Feel free to cut this in favour of something like Upstart Goblin if you value the consistency over extension.  <u><strong>Extra Deck</strong></u>  <strong>Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon x 1</strong>  We start our look at the extra deck with the first Blue-Eyes synchro monster Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon. Azure-Eyes has a couple of useful effects we’ll go over: firstly on the turn it’s summoned it prevents you and your opponent with targeting or destroying dragon monsters you control, and secondly it lets you summon a normal monster from your graveyard during your standby phase. The primary effect is obviously most useful when summoned off of Spirit Dragon during your opponent’s turn but it can also assist with OTKs in hands where you have your XYZs on the field already. The secondary effect can help with extension and popping spell or trap cards with a little setup. It all depends on what you have available in the grave — if you have a Dragon Spirit of White you’re good to pop a spell or trap, but if not the best option is a Blue-Eyes White Dragon for extension. You can absolutely cut this if you’d prefer to go deeper into the XYZs package but I like it for its ability to resolve niche hands with a single level eight.  <strong>Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon x 1</strong>  The second extra deck card we’ll be going over is the other notable Blue-Eyes synchro Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon. I’ve gone over his effects at length but briefly for those of you skim reading: he stops anyone summoning more than 2 monsters at once plus he can negate any effect that activates in the graveyard once per turn. His last effect lets us tag him out for any light Dragon extra deck monster, normally that’ll be Azure-Eyes but we play another target in Black Rose Moonlight Dragon. Which of these you choose depends entirely on what sort of board state you’re facing but I’ll go more into detail about the use cases of each target in their respective entries. You can cut this and the entire synchro package if you’d like but you’ll want to update the maindeck to include more rank eight support at that point.  <strong>Cloudcastle x 1</strong>  Our third synchro is here purely for True King of All Calamities setups on the followup. Cloudcastle is slated to get a little more popular with the release of the Virtual World archetype two days ago at time of writing. I suspect it’ll be popular there for much the same reason it is here; it allows for simple True King set-ups on the followup using spent level nine synchros like Spirit Dragon or Azure-Eyes. Its on field effect actively works against our strategy so I’d recommend only going into Cloudcastle when you have access to another level nine in grave. You can remove this but I wouldn’t recommend it as True King of All Calamities is a significant part of our game plan.  <strong>Black Rose Moonlight Dragon x 1</strong>  The final synchro monster and the second Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon target is Black Rose Moonlight Dragon. We play Black Rose as a monster negate accessible by our synchro line so as to not be left without interaction on some niche hands. We have no way to summon this normally so I wouldn’t recommend relying on this without Spirit Dragon access or alterations to the main deck. Feel free to take this out for another Spirit Dragon target or a larger XYZs package.  <strong>True King of All Calamities x 1</strong>  The first of our XYZs is also the most well-known and oppressive card in the deck. True King of All Calamities has been the gold standard of floodgate monsters since its release in 2017 in Maximum Crisis. As I mentioned above we summon him through followup lines specifically involving Cloudcastle and a spent Spirit Dragon or Azure-Eyes in grave. As a followup play True King is incredible; if your opponent’s board is already simplified by various pops and negates, True King of All Calamities will stop them from coming back altogether. It’s 3000 attack is also notable as a way to close out games, given that every extender in the deck has at least 2500 attack. I wouldn’t recommend cutting this as it’s our most powerful followup, but if you dislike floodgates then more Blue-Eyes extra deck support could be an option.  <strong>Number 92: Heart EartH Dragon x 1</strong>  Next up is our first Draglubion target Heart EartH Dragon, a situational but powerful option against decks lacking in non-destruction removal. Its first effect prevents it from being destroyed by battle while dealing all battle damage you would have taken to your opponent. Its second effect allows it to resurrect on destruction providing you have material with the added bonus of it gaining 1000 attack for every banished monster on re-summon. This together can make it hard for decks without highly specific tech or non-destruction removal to out this card before we run it into their most powerful monster for big damage. You could remove this in favour of another relevant Draglubion target but I’ve found this to be unexpected and powerful in casual play.  <strong>Number 97: Draglubion x 1</strong>  Finally onto the card that ties our XYZs package together and allows us to cheat out a variety of targets, Number 97: Draglubion. For those unfamiliar Draglubion’s effect allows one to detach a material to summon any Dragon-type Number monster from the extra deck by attaching another one from the extra deck to it. This is the core of our best lines as we can turn any two level eight extenders into 9000 damage going second or a negate going first. Aside from this Draglubion also cannot be targeted with card effects which can help in keeping it alive for followup plays. Not much more to say on this one as I’ve gone into greater detail in the entries for the targets above and below. I wouldn't recommend cutting this as it ties the extra deck together but there are a huge number of targets for its effect that you could test.  <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy x 1</strong>  The second to last XYZs and Draglubion target that we’ll be looking at is Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy. The name is quite a mouthful so I’ll be referring to him as Hope Harbinger for the sake of my editor. Hope Harbinger’s effect is a combination of synergistic negation and powerful floating that compliments our first turn end boards nicely. Its first effect is a standard spell or effect negate that attaches the negated card to it as material while its second effect allows us to redirect attacks to it by detaching a material. This can be useful for keeping our other XYZs alive or preventing any OTKs. On the chance that an XYZs is destroyed while it’s on the field Hope Harbinger allows us to give attack equal to one of the destroyed monsters to itself or any other XYZs you control. This helps to facilitate OTKs on the followup as the attack gain is permanent. I wouldn’t recommend cutting this as it’s another of this build’s powerful going first options, but if you do decide to cut it I’d recommend another negate to replace it.  <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon x 1</strong>  Our last XYZs and Draglubion target is Number 100: Numeron Dragon, the largest beat-stick in the build. We summon this with Draglubion’s effect like the rest, however unlike the rest this tends to end games in one swing. When on the draw one only has to summon this with the above effect before detaching its one and only material to have it gain attack equal to the combined ranks of all XYZs monsters on the field times 1000. Assuming itself and Draglubion are the only monsters on the field this will result in 9000 attack for Numeron Dragon, which providing you’ve chipped in over prior turns should result in a win. This makes up the majority of followup plays from boards where Draglubion survives to your second turn and your opponent has left something in attack position. Worse for them if they happen to have an XYZs monster on the field as that will result in even higher attack for Numeron Dragon. I wouldn’t cut this if you value the ability to close games quickly, however if you’d prefer to favour the next monster removing it could be an option.  <strong>Accesscode Talker x 1</strong>  Next up is last stop of our link climb and second OTK enabler Accesscode Talker. My readers will probably recognize Accesscode as he was released earlier this year in Eternity Code and has been played in anything capable of making a link four. We climb into Accesscode in a typical line involving Halqifibrax and Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians aided by our single copy of Master with Eyes of Blue in grave. This will give us a 5300 attack monster and one to two banishes from the field to resolve whatever board our opponent has. Feel free to remove this combo and payoff — I favoured it because of going second hands that lack a second level eight extender but that's only relevant in this build specifically.  <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master magicians x 1</strong>  Next up is Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians, the third stop on our link-climb to Accesscode Talker. A good link monster in her own right, Selene is played mostly for her effect. On summon she gains spell counters equal to the number of spell cards in both graveyards and on the field which can be removed three at a time to summon any spellcaster type from your hand or graveyard. This is always Master with Eyes of Blue in this build but if you replaced Ghost Ogre with Effect Veiler you’ll have more targets on average. From the summon of our spellcaster from hand or grave we link Selene off with it for Accesscode, enabling our alternative OTK line. If you cut Accesscode obviously cut this in favour of something more synergistic with your build.  <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax x 1</strong>  I really hope all my readers understand why we play this next link monster, Crystron Halqifibrax. At time of writing Halqifibrax has been at large in the TCG for eight months since its release in Duel Overload, enabling all sorts of combos. In this build it enables the above mentioned Accesscode combo along with a few synchro lines in hands with at least two extenders. Normally you’ll want to summon the one copy of The White Stone of Legend off of Halqifibrax’s effect, although The White Stone of Ancients is acceptable in a pinch. Both can be linked off for one of a couple options we’ll go over shortly to get their searches off should you need them. As with the other links we’ve been over this can be cut if you don’t favour the Accesscode lines; alternatively one could emphasize this option with the addition of Linkross and Martial Metal Marcher for better synchro payoffs.  <strong>Heiratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres x 1 </strong>  Our last link two is a favourite of many modern Dragon-tribal lists such as Dragon Link. Heiratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres is probably the most generally playable of all the Heiratic archetype as it allows us to cheat out our Dragon Spirit of White while bouncing a card from our opponent’s field. This can be enough to stall out an opponent’s turn long enough for one to draw into one of this build’s two OTK lines. I tested replacing this with I:P Masquerana but that often lost me games even with proper targets instead of the Accesscode climb. As a result I would recommend keeping this in the build regardless of what changes you make as until Blue-Eyes gets a link two of their own, this will be the best option.  <strong>Linkuriboh x 1</strong>  Time for the second to last link monster now, Linkuriboh is one of the best generic link ones out there. Many of you will be familiar with this one and its uses as it has been played in a variety of strategies thanks to its ability to convert tokens into link fuel. We play it here as a corner case for getting our level one tuners in the grave if we have no extenders or alternative normal summons. This doesn’t come up often mind, as we have a<strong> 76%</strong> chance to open at least one extender, but I still value this pick. You can cut this if you want to move away from the synchro lines with your build as another target for Draglubion would be better in that case.  <strong>Relinquished Anima x 1</strong>  Finally we reach the last extra deck monster, Relinquished Anima: a link one that doubles as a removal spell in specific cases. Like the other extra deck Relinquished monsters Anima can equip one face-up monster to itself, providing it’s pointing to that monster. In practise this means that any player careless enough to leave a monster face up in front of either extra monster zone can be punished with Anima and any of our level one tuners. Like Linkuriboh above, this also assists in getting our level one tuners in the graveyard for their effects or for a Chaos Dragon play. I wouldn’t cut this from any list with level ones as it can be an amazing boon if your opponent forgets or doesn't know to play around it. <ol start=""2"">  	<li><strong>Sidedeck and Tech Choices: </strong><strong>The Casual Dilemma </strong></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <u><strong>Handtraps and the Side Deck</strong></u>  &nbsp;  <strong>Notes on the Side Deck</strong>  Before I get started I’d like to explain my choices around the side deck and the handtraps I’ve elected to include in the main deck. This deck was built for a couple smaller tournaments that I predicted would have a slower meta compared to the current competitive scene. This proved to be the correct call for the tournaments I was in but I would caution against the same side deck for competitive play. That aside the reason I decided to maindeck Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit was mostly due to it being live more often than PSY-Framegear Gamma and it not taking up another maindeck slot with PSY-Frame Driver. If you’d prefer Gamma it doesn't alter much of the deck beyond finding a slot for Driver so go for it if you need a more competitive option. One last thing of note before I go over Ghost Ogre is my inclusion of Dante, Pilgrim of the Burning Abyss. He’s here as an optional punish for Dogmatika strategies running Maximus as when he’s sent off of an opponent’s Maximus he rips a card from their hand. I find this funny and worth playing in a casual setting but if you’d prefer N’Tss that is a better option.  &nbsp;  <strong>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit x 3</strong>  Now to look at our only main deck handtrap Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit. I’ve already gone over a lot of why we play it above so here I’ll go over its synergies with the rest of our build. Chief among the synergy is the aforementioned Emergency Teleport allowing us to summon one of these anytime we can can fire off a quick-play spell. This will allows us to get more interaction if needed or more commonly to extend into Halqifibrax on the followup for Accesscode Talker. If you prefer Ash Blossom or any of the other popular handtraps you can switch this out for them, although in that case you’d be better switching Emergency Teleport for Upstart Goblin or another consistency booster. <ol start=""3"">  	<li><strong>Combo Guide: </strong><strong>The Real Return of the Dragon Lords</strong></li> </ol> Time now to look at some of the deck’s combos going first along with some notes on potential followup plays. I’ve chosen to include three of the more common openers to hopefully illustrate how the deck performs on average along with some data to show how often one can expect them. One of the deck’s strongest suits is its flexibility while playing through a couple interruptions going first or second so I’ll try to highlight this where possible. <ol>  	<li><strong>Any Level 8 Extender Plus Level 1 Tuner </strong></li> </ol> Starting off with a classic opener of Blue-Eyes decks, this opener will leave us with a Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon and the ability to tag out into Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon for its protection effect. This hand can take several forms with a<strong> 22% </strong>chance to open any variant of it. The most optimal is a hand of Blue-Eyes Alternative and White Dragons plus The White Stone of Legend. To start we’ll summon our level eight of choice — say Alternative White Dragon in this case but any of the Dangers work too. From there we’ll normal summon our White Stone of Ancients and then synchro summon Blue Eyes Spirit Dragon. If we have a couple extra extenders Hope Harbinger or Draglubion can be good additions to increase the stickiness of your board. A followup from here can be as simple as going into True King of All Calamities with the aid of Cloudcastle, or detaching your other material from Draglubion to summon Number 100: Numeron Dragon for a swift OTK. This alone is the weakest of our openings but with the addition of other interaction it can still close out games.  &nbsp; <ol start=""2"">  	<li><strong>2</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon plus Blue-Eyes White Dragon and a Danger! Monster</strong></li> </ol> Next up a slightly more common opening at <strong>40% </strong>to open going first and <strong>50%</strong> going second. This play ends on boards of our rank eight XYZs package — normally Draglubion and Hope Harbinger going first, or Draglubion and Numeron Dragon going second. This represents a negate and Towers-ish effect in Draglubion’s first effect going first or 9000 damage on board for a quick OTK. All the followups I recommend from here involve using Draglubion’s effect again either for the above-mentioned damage line or Heart-eartH Dragon for stickier boards. This opening is normally enough to close out games against the build’s intended targets but if you have the option combining this with any of the other lines mentioned here it’ll result in exponentially stronger boards.  &nbsp; <ol start=""3"">  	<li><strong>3</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Raiden plus any extender; going second </strong></li> </ol> The final line we’ll be looking at is our alternate OTK line going second, although this can double as a followup effectively. All you’ll need is Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn and a monster you can special summon like any of our Danger! monsters. At<strong> 31%</strong> to open this going first and <strong>40%</strong> going second this hand is hardly rare but exceptionally powerful. To start we’ll normal summon Raiden, remembering to mill two with his effect before special summoning our extender and linking both off for Halqifibrax. We’ll then use Halqifibrax’s effect to special summon Master with Eyes of Blue providing we didn’t mill it off of Raiden’s effect. This will allow us to link both of them off for Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians before using her effect to summon back Master with Eyes of Blue and linking both of them off for Accesscode Talker. From here you’ll have a 5300 attack monster and two banishes from the field with which to close out the game. There’s normally no need to followup from this point but if you find yourself not winning from here I’d recommend a rank eight play or anything that’ll put more damage on board.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <ol start=""4"">  	<li><strong> Final Thoughts</strong></li> </ol> &nbsp;  Finally we reach the end of this guide, I appreciate all of you who took the time to read this. If you enjoyed this or found it helpful why not leave a like or comment? I try to put out one of these every couple weeks so if you’d like me to cover a specific deck or archetype let me know in the comments below or on Discord @CryptidYgo#6296. I’ll also take a minute to plug my Discord server The Yu-Gi-Oh Writers Guild. We’re a community of Yu-Gi-Oh content creators who provide help and feedback as well as opportunities for self promotion. At the end of this week on November 15th we’ll be hosting the first in a series of four free-to-enter tournaments, The Winter Revel. If you’d like to learn more about this or the Discord check us out <a>here</a>.  As for my final thoughts on the deck I have to say I was surprised by how much fun I had with this list. I haven’t tried to hide that this is a casual list for casual play but despite that this list exceeded my expectations. The combo of Draglubion plus Hope Harbinger wound up being too much for many rogue tier and below decks due to how consistent it is. While I don’t think this list would hold up competitively in today’s meta I was surprised how much fun Yu-Gi-Oh can still be. Despite all the Halq-Kross combos and nine negate set-ups going first that plague the current meta it is still possible to have fun playing Yu-Gi-Oh at any level. If like me you’re feeling a tad burned out by the grind of meta play I would highly recommend returning to a more casual environment with a deck like this. That’s going to be it from me but until next time stay safe and have fun.  &nbsp;"

Typically you would like to see a first hand consisting of Dragonmaid Ernus, Kitchen/Parlor Dragonmaid, Interrupted Kaiju Slumber/Any Kaiju and either a utility spell (Dragonmaid Hospitality or World Legacy Guarddragon) or another smaller girl such as Nurse (to be used in tandem with Kitchen and/or Parlor to recycle whatever you feel the need to ditch) or Chamber Dragonmaid to push for a very early Fusion. In my opinion, Sheou should be brought out first to bait a negation or any other kind of response, given her effect to give you a free House Dragonmaid after the fact. You want to have House out during those standby phases if you don't have the full quattro of smaller girls and if going for the Kaiju strategy, she can help push for total game if you're able to revive or summon two girls.  Going 2nd, and with Kaijus, House and only two other Dragonmaids will win you game providing your opponent is either asleep at the wheel or you outsmart them with either Sheou or some other trickery. Chamber can fetch you Changeover and any other Dragonmaid spell in the deck and thus is essential when played with Kitchen/Parlor - these two smaller girls are your main combo with their ditching and fetching effects, Nurse acts as a total bonus if you can play her with them. Laundry is not to be overlooked either, and she can easily come through for you, given that she only ditches three cards and can come from behind with this if you're lacking in Kitchen. If played with Nurse, you hopefully can recycle something for a series of effects.  Note! The start of your or your opponent's Battle Phase provides the opportunity to tag out your little dragons for their bigger counterparts (either from hand or the GY, which means you can chain both Ernus and/or Tinkhec for basically entirely free effects) but these effects of the smaller girls DO NOT chain. Tagging out Kitchen for Tinkhec, for example, will not cause you to chain Parlor for Lorpar. It is always the start of the Battle Phase until you declare your very first attack target, this is such an sneaky tech - on top of all that, House's pop effect doesn't chain either! Her effect is inherited by the tagging in and out. This means you can wipe your opponent's monsters away without any chains going off to potentially make your strategy vulnerable!  And like I said - Interrupted Kaiju Slumber into House +2 or just three Dragonmaids should net you the game in a single Battle Phase, but do not be afraid to play the longer game. Due to this deck's ability to play without the worry of your hand (as you'll be constantly with four cards in hand after setting up the whole board), it can actually play the grind, especially if you can give your opponent some bother with House Dragonmaid. Dragonmaid Welcome can also recycle Changeover if you control two of more Dragonmaid monsters so you can aptly go into House and Sheou as much as you need. Even if they hit the GY, Chamber can swap into them there as well!  Be confident and be bold and these lovely girls can net you a swift or a must desired win regardless of the turn or time limit. Have faith in them!"

The strategy works by firing off with Rikka Petal consistently from the first turn and during every turn you're able - DNA Surgery could make this easier given that the Extra Deck uses a lot of the Galaxy-Eyes and other Dragon Rank 8s because of how easily you can go into them via Snowdrop. Rikka Petal can fetch you Snowdrop or Mudan from the deck every turn and with just those two cards you can build the entire strategy. The idea is to flood the field via Snowdrop's effect of summoning two Rikka cards by tributing Petal, with Primula in hand as well, this becomes 3 and they can all be changed to Level 8, 4 or 6 via Snowdrop. This gives you access to all three of the deck's boss monsters (Teardrop, Strenna and Kanzashi respectively, or even Number 87: Queen of the Night!) and can lead to systematically removing your opponent's monsters by using Rikka Flurries off of Mudan's fetch effect. Once Snowdrop hits the GY (you ideally want to detach her from any Xyz monster first), simply use Rikka Tranquility to bring her back and circumvent her locking effect. With a recycled Snowdrop, the Galaxy-Eyes and Dragon Xyz portion of the Extra Deck becomes available to use and finish off your opponent with overwhelming prejudice.  By using either Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, or the small portion of Blue-Eyes support as well, you want to link into Galaxy Satellite Dragon for the final combo (if you can get Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon out too, that's a bonus) in cooperation with Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon. Combine these dragons' effects together and Tachyon Dragon will soar to 10,700 attack points, attacking your opponent twice, and negating their board for that Battle Phase. At that point, the game is over.  Constantly tributing your Rikka and plant monsters will keep Rikka Flurries firing off, which forces your opponent to tribute their own monsters. And with a plant material on any of your Teardrops, her effect becomes a quickie and will tribute yet more monsters for your opponent. A cheeky tech is using Strenna in rapid play and tributing her to fire off Flurries and gain a fresh Teardrop and using her effect too. With Kanzashi on the field with them, you don't even have to tribute cards you don't want.  The real gem in this deck, is Rikka Petal - providing you control only plants or no monsters at all, she comes back to the field during your opponent's End Phase. And this can be extremely annoying for them to try and deal with. Even if they banish one of her, you still have two copies, and even Lonefire Blossom to fetch her again and again. Constantly recycling Snowdrop and Mudan with Tranquility can recycle so much of your GY, so don't worry about your deck thinning, this is what you want. Combining DNA Surgery, or possibly even two copies of it can help you keep Flurries on the field, as well as dealing with the Zombie World Deck at Rogue currently by making your Rikkas plant monsters even after they've played Zombie World. In addition, Rikka isn't effected much by Buster Blader and his deck given that you can force them to tribute around the Swordsman/Dragon lock combo and then use Teardrop to get rid of the other one once you're out of it.  In combination with the Rank 8 package, this deck just becomes mean with a consistent method of summoning monster after monster with 3000+ attack points or equally annoying effects."

The XYZ extra deck is something you can change, depends on your playstyle.  Same for the side-deck. It's something you can change as you want and depends on the meta. My side deck is just an idea.  This deck is good going first, but sadly it's very sensitive to Handtraps. One Droll &amp; lock bird and you can surrend. If your loop get negated, this is hard too. That's why I play <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent.</a>  Thanks for reading and I hope you like it!  Here is a quick combo video I made:  https://youtu.be/6SXCSCSux8s"

The main playing style of this deck is to spam out Trickstar monsters, activate their effects to burn, and go into the bigger links, most likely Bella Modanna. You'll want to activate lots of effects as you go, to burn as much as you can. You'll also want to set up a Live Stage before you link climb, as it provides more link materials.

Let me run down the details real quick:  I made this new deck so that you could do one of three things: <ol>  	<li>Pay life points to have something awesome happen</li>  	<li>Gain life points to keep yourself in the game</li>  	<li>draw extra cards so you are never out of a viable option</li> </ol> If you guys have followed my past decks, you know that I am better at making 60-card decks; this deck is another example of that.  I even made it so that the extra deck contains all cards that have to do with one of the three themes that I put into the main deck.  It was hard but I hope you like it and we can forget about the whole ""Exodia"" Thing for the time being.  If you still want to hold a grudge, that is fine, but I have done everything I can to fix my mistake so please take your grudge somewhere else.  Please enjoy the replacement deck that I worked really hard on and even tested for you guys!"

Another staple 3 of.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Dark Magician Girl: This card is mainly used as a beatstick, as it has an easy summoning condition to fulfill, and has the ability to attack the turn it is summoned. BLS does a slightly better job at what this card does, however.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Cyber Dragon: Toon Cyber Dragon is an alright card, as it does have the amazing effect of Cyber Dragon. This card is mainly used for plays with Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon and Cyber Dragon Infinity.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Mermaid: While this card doesn’t have an incredible effect, it can be special summoned for free, and is not limited to once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Harpie Lady: This card is similar to Toon Mermaid in the fact that it can be summoned for free, and even allows you to pop a Spell/Trap if another Toon is on board, but it can only be summoned once per turn, which is why it’s at 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Eater Of Millions: This card synergizes well with the negative effect of Toon Kingdom, turning it into a positive for this card. It’s also a good piece of removal. For its summoning condition, you should banish the entire Extra Deck, except for: Cyber Dragon Nova, Cyber Dragon Infinity, and Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x The Black Stone Of Legend: Allows you to summon Red-Eyes Toon Dragon for free, and lets you recycle it from GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Comic Hand: An incredible card, allowing for a lot of cheesy plays. It’s very easy to sneak wins off of this card. It’s even better now, considering it is able to be searched with Toon Bookmark.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Kingdom: Is a great replacement for Toon World, as it treats itself as Toon World when on the field, and offers protection for your Toons. However, it’s cost for its effect is quite the downside at times.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x One For One: Used to search The Black Stone Of Legend.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Terraforming: Used to search Toon Kingdom.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Bookmark: A great search card, allowing you to search Comic Hand where Toon Table Of Contents could not. However, it balances this out by being a once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Table Of Contents: Your main search card, used to get cards such as Toon Bookmark, Toon Kingdom, and any of your Toon monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Page-Flip: Used as a one of, because drawing into it without Toon Kingdom is really bad, and the card itself isn’t a necessity, and is more of a “nice to have” card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Terror: Amazing negate.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon: Good card that pairs well with Toon Cyber Dragon, letting you remove an opponent’s monster for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 38 Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy: Used mainly for its negate effect. It’s a great summon if you can get 2 Toon Black Luster Soldiers, or 1 Toon Black Luster Soldier and an Toon Ancient Gear Golem on board.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 11 Big Eye: You’re more likely to get this on field than you would Number 38. It’s used for its control effect. However, Comic Hand is better, so it’s best to use Comic Hand over this card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova: Used with Cyber Dragon Infinty; overlay your 2 Toon Cyber Dragons to summon this.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Infinity: Yet another incredible negate, along with a removal effect that doesn’t target.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Time Thief Redoer: Used as an easy to summon Rank 4 with generic materials and a great effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Abyss Dweller: Same reasons as Time Thief Redoer.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Gagaga Cowboy: Same reasons as Abyss Dweller and Time Thief Redoer.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Borrelsword Dragon: Good boss monster, and a staple Link.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: Good spot removal.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Phoenix: Pops an s/t, and is easier to summon than Unicorn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Linkuriboh: Ran in case of bricks with Black Stone Of Legend.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Relinquished Anima: Same reason as Linkuriboh.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Buster Blader: Used for its level, being viable material for Number 11, and is supposed to replace Toon Ancient Gear Golem.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Barrel Dragon: Again, used for its ability to be material for Number 11, and is used to replace Toon Ancient Gear Golem. Its effect, while being a gamble effect, is still relatively useful.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Cyber Dragon: In case you want to consistently get out Cyber Dragon Infinity.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Harpie Lady: In case you want to get your Rank 4s out easier.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Bahamut Shark: Used with Toon Mermaid as material, and its intended effect target is Toadally Awesome.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toadally Awesome: Great Bahamut Shark target, you could even say it’s totally awesome.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Mimicat: Isn’t ran in Main Deck due to its lack of usefulness. It’s heavily outclassed by Comic Hand. But, if your opponent runs a lot of staple spells/traps, this may be an okay card to run.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Page-Flip: Used if you want to see Page-Flip more.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Terror: Good negation.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Briefcase: While this card doesn’t negate summons, it can completely mess up plays by removing key monsters from the field without destroying or targeting.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Mask: Good summoning effect, but it’s a bit too reliant on the opponent running high level monsters.</span>"

You can either go the immortal dragunity strategy of always having dragunity monsters easily summon able with divine lance equipped or otherwise, or you can do the dragon drowning strategy. getting as many dragons out on the field as possible suffocating your opponent in sheer power and size. its not a very meta deck but it has a lot of ways where, despite the inherent inconsistency of the 60 cards its very good at finding a playable strategy with almost any cards in hand. once again not meta, so you wound be pulling off massive combos in the first turn. its a good deck to feel powerful but slow down the gameplay a little for some fun."

I have been busy with college and other things in my life. But I've had this deck tested a while ago but never got to post it so now here it is! This deck is pretty consistent, theres not much to say about it, it's a control deck. You want to go first and setup a negate(s) and or interruptions with Mechaba and the True Draco cards. Triple <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> was actually really nice, if you don't like it you can take it out and replace with something of your choosing. There aren't really any draw power cards I can recommend to replace it with so you'd have to come up with something yourself. I hope you guys enjoy, and stick around for more cool decks made by me!"

The main goal is to spam the field with as many Yoke as possible and then recycle with Kaiser when needed. Safe Zone keeps Yoke alive and he cant be targeted, but also is a great way to pop an enemy monster if its set and destroyed, by targeting one of your opponents monsters with it. This deck can be a bit slow at times, so that's why you run so many traps. Like the title says, this is budget (other than the Infernoble engine, which is over half the decks whole price), so feel free to swap out for more expensive hand traps. Let me know if you have any thoughts on ways to improve the deck, other than beefing up the hand traps! Thank you!"

The deck is quite consistent, and is able to end on a board of Borreload Savage Dragon, and Herald Of The Arc Light. I will give my reasonings for playing each card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Megalosmasher X: Used as a Rescue Rabbit target to go into XYZ plays with Evolzar Dolkka and Evolzar Laggia.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Sabersaurus: Ran for the same reasons as Megalosmasher X, but is ran at 2 due to its lower ATK stat.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Angel Trumpeter: Good level for a tuner, but is not the optimal tuner to use.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Galaxy Serpent: Level 2 tuners are the best for this deck, hence why this card is in it. However, it is ran at 2 due to its lackluster stats.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Mystical Shine Ball: Has a good level, and is used as the target for The Agent Of Creation- Venus’ effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Guardragon Justica: Level 2 tuner with a high defense stat, which is why it is ran at 3 rather than Galaxy Serpent.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cosmo Brain: Its summoning condition can lead to GY setup, and its on-field effect lets you get a normal monster for free, at the cost of an effect monster, be it itself or a Tenyi.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Tenyi Spirit- Mapyura: You can substitute this with any level 4 Tenyi, or even Adhara, to be honest, but this is preferred due to its negation effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Rescue Rabbit: One of the best normal monster support cards, this lets you easily summon things like Megalosmasher X and Sabersaurus to the field for XYZ plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x The Agent Of Creation- Venus: One of the best cards in the deck. Having this on field greatly increases the consistency of your combos, letting you summon a level 2 monster for practically free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Draconnet: Used for its effect to bring out on of your tuners for free. Do NOT target Mystical Shine Ball with this card’s effect, and always summon from deck if possible.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Enchanting Fitting Room: This card really has no downside, except for the fact that not excavating a target is a -1, but that’s excusable, as it allows you to summon your tuners for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Faustian Bargain: Good removal that doesn’t destroy, and the special summon is icing on the cake. This can even be used on your own monsters, such as a lingering Linkross, in order to extend combos.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Swing Of Memories: Really good revival spell.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Unexpected Dai: Incredible combo starter, having this card in hand ensures at least a couple of plays, many of which end in at least 2 negates.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Borreload Savage Dragon: A great negation card, you’ll be wanting to use a Crystron Halqifibrax in your GY as the target for this card’s effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi: Incredible effect, having a non-destruction, non-targeting removal effect that banishes. Its Battle Phase effect isn’t as important, but it’s still good to note.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Coral Dragon: Used for its removal effect, and its effect when it leaves the field.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Brionac, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier: Good bouncing effect, especially when going second. Can easily lead to an OTK.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Ally Of Justice Catastor: Old school, but still has a very good effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Herald Of The Arc Light: Incredible, easy to get out negate/floodgate. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Martial Metal Marcher: Used as a combo piece in order to bring out Herald Of The Arc Light using Linkross’ tokens.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Evolzar Laggia: The better Evolzar, this card functions as a Solemn Judgement, negating almost everything (except for monster effects).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Evolzar Dolkka: While this is slightly worse, it does negate monster effects, which is incredibly useful in its own right.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Daigusto Emeral: Mainly used for its second effect in this deck, allowing for easy revival of a normal monster, whether it be a tuner or not.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Crystron Halqifibrax: A staple card for any modern Synchro deck, this is one of the key pieces to most combos in this deck. Getting a free tuner on board is just that important.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Link Spider: Incredible normal monster support. This allows for numerous combos, and is only limited to a soft once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Monk Of The Tenyi: Used to send your Tenyi(s) to the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Linkross: One of the cards that makes this deck possible. You’ll want to use this after summoning a Crystron Halqifibrax, and summon Martial Metal Marcher, which will then go into Herald Of The Arc Light.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Tune Warrior: Level 3 tuner. Not as useful as level 2 or 4, but has the ability to be usable.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Galaxy Serpent: In case you want more level 2 tuners.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Flamvell Guard: Level 1 tuner; not as useful as levels 2, 3, and 4.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Tenyi Spirit- Shthana: Used to replace Mapyura. This can be substituted for any other Tenyi, except Adhara.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Tenyi Spirit- Adhara: Good tuner with an easy to fulfill summon condition.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Shooting Riser Dragon: Good combo extender, but the level is a bit too difficult to pull off for it to not be in Side Deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Berserker Of The Tenyi: Good beatstick, can be used to Link off unnecessary cards like any leftover Linkross.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Dark Ruler No More: Great going second card, can disrupt many plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Enchanting Fitting Room: In case you wanted another.</span>"

I'd be very grateful for any feedback or constructive criticism.</span></strong></p> &nbsp;  <span><strong>Reasons the card(s) are in this deck:</strong></span> <p><span><strong>Monsters</strong></span> <span>Almost all of the effects that reference other cards involve level 2 or lower monster cards.</span> <span>Thus, most of the monster cards are level 2 or lower. They are also all beasts.</span></p> <span><strong>Melffy Puppy/ Catty/ Pony and Fenny</strong> (x3 of each): All great for swarming. It's good to get as many of these on the field as possible, for defence and to use as material for the Xyz monsters. These aren't easy to get rid of since when an enemy special, normal summons, or attacks one of these cards, these cards' effects allow them to be brought back to the hand, and another summoned in its place. They can also be special summoned in your end phase. I included 3 of each to increase chances of successful swarming.</span>  <span><strong>Melffy Rabby</strong> (x3): <span>Also great for swarming, although unlike the other Melffys, Rabby doesn't have any effects. It does, however, have a high defence and will likely stick around on the field longer than the other Melffys. Again, I included 3 to increase chances of successful swarming.</span></span>  <span><strong>Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> (x2): Good for circulating the cards. If you have a card you don't want, and need to get another monster on the field, this is perfect for grabbing one of the lower level monsters. Since it doesn't change things dramatically, I only include 2.</span>  <span><strong>Kalentosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> (x3): A good way to take out some strong monsters. I included 3 in case something with high ATK/DEF needs to be taken out. </span>  <span><b>Uniflora, <strong>Mystical Beast of the Forest </strong></b>(x1): Since all the monsters in this deck are beasts, this effect will always be an option. Don't feel the need for more than one of these.</span>  <span><b>Wrecker Panda </b>(x1): Another level 2 monster to keep things interesting. If you use its effect, <em>Wrecker Panda's</em> ATK/DEF would most likely both raise to 1,200, since most of the cards in this deck are level 2.</span>  <span><b>Bujingi Wolf </b>(x1): Its effect is useful, and I like to have a couple of stronger monsters in the deck, just in case. Just one of these. </span>  <span><b>Rodenut </b>(x1): If you can keep him on the field long enough (Bujingi Wolf's effect would help protect him from battle), this can be good for removing strong enemy monsters, similarly to <em>Kalentosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest</em>. Just one of this card; it's not very strong, so I find it a bit risky.</span>  <span><b>Danger Jackalope </b>(x1): Not sure how often people would use this card in a deck with no other <em>Danger!</em> cards. I like to use the effect of this when I have a lot of cards in my hand, so it's likely it'll be put in the field. Trouble is, if your opponent does pick this card from your hand and <em>Danger!? Jackalope?</em> is discarded, there are no other <em>Danger!</em> monsters in this deck to summon. You might want to switch out one of the Melffy core cards for another <em>Danger!</em> monster. This is how I've been playing this deck so far, but I might update this deck to have another <em>Danger!</em> monster.</span>  <span><b>Rescue Ferret </b>(x1): Allows you to bring back 3 core Melffy cards (or other level 2 or lower monsters) from the graveyard. Only one of this as a last resort. <em>Feel free to correct me on this, but I've included this card based on the assumption the special summoned cards can then be used as material for one of the Xyz monsters before they would be destroyed during the End Phase.</em> </span> <p><span><strong>Spells</strong></span> <span>These ones are mostly about getting monsters on the field, giving them extra attack, and protecting them from being destroyed.</span></p> <span><b>Melffy Hide and Seek </b>(x3): Protects those Melffys (and friends) and gets another beast on the field. Very handy, so 3 of these.</span>  <span><b>Melffy Tag </b>(x3): Just another chance to get another Melffy out of the graveyard and back in action. Once again, 3 of these. The more Melffy's on the field, the better.</span>  <span><b>Melffy Playhouse </b>(x2): If you're in a tight spot, this'll let you send your enemies back home. It'll also power your Xyz monster up! 2 of these should do.</span>  <span><strong>Closed Forest</strong> (x1)</span> <span>Chances are, there will often be a fair few monsters in the graveyard. This'll take advantage of that. The more beasts in the graveyard, the stronger the ones on the field will be. Just 1 of these for that extra boost</span>  <span><strong>Rush Recklessly</strong> (x1)</span> <span><span>While <em>Closed Forest</em> is a potentially small power up for a lot of cards, this is a large power up for 1 specific one. Choose your timing carefully though. Just 1 of these to leave room for other more important cards.</span></span>  <span><b>Obedience Schooled </b>(x1)</span> <span><span>Like <em>Rescue Ferret</em>, this allows you to bring back 3 level 2 or lower monsters. As its effects are more or less the same as <em>Rescue Ferret</em>, I only included 1. <em>Again, feel free to correct me on this, but I've included this card based on the assumption the special summoned cards can then be used as material for one of the Xyz monsters before they would be destroyed during the End Phase.</em></span></span>  <span><b>Spiritual Forest </b>(x1)</span> <span>Protects 1 beast monster from being destroyed each turn (remember, all of the monsters in this deck are beasts). Not as useful as <em>Melffy Hide and Seek</em>, so just 1 of these.</span>  <span><b>Forest </b>(x1)</span> <span>An additional 200 ATK/DEF for all our monsters. Just one for that extra helpful boost.</span>  <span><b>Child's Play </b>(x1)</span> <span>An additional 300 LP for each opponent's special summon? Yes please! Rack up that health! Just one to help out a bit. It'd take a long time to obtain 10,000 life points with this being the only LP based card, so the second effect isn't likely that useful, but the LP you do get is helpful enough. Just one of this card.</span> <p><span><strong>Extra deck/XYZ monsters</strong></span></p> <span><strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> (x3):</span> <span>Try and get those 5 materials on activate all 3 effects. Then increase its ATK with those spell card, and start destroying.</span>  <span><strong>Joyous Melffys</strong> (x2):</span> <span>Honestly, I haven't used this yet. It's the extra deck though, so why not?</span>  <span><strong>Melffy of the Forest</strong> (x2):</span> <span>Umm.. I don't have these cards, so haven't tried them. When I do, I'll probably update this.</span>"

But, the deck has some level of consistency. The deck is mainly for fun, however, and is not designed for any serious competition.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x The Wicked Dreadroot: This is the worst of the Wicked Gods, and thus is only ran at 1.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x The Wicked Avatar: The best Wicked God card, having an amazing effect that blocks your opponent from spells and trap for 4 whole turns. The card has a built in Moon Mirror Shield effect, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x The Wicked Eraser: The second best Wicked God. It has an incredible board wiping effect when it is destroyed, which will primarily be done via its own effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Ahrima, The Wicked Warden: Used primarily to search your Lair Of Darkness from the deck. It also conflicts with the levels of most of your monsters, so it is only ran at 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Lilith, Lady Of Lament: One of the better cards in the deck, and definitely has the best effect. Even if it is negated with Tour Guide From The Underworld, it can still activate the effect, which uses its cost to tribute. If you have Lair Of Darkness, you practically get to tribute an opponent’s monster for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Tour Guide From The Underworld: One of the best Fiend-type supports in the game, especially in this deck, as a majority of the monsters in it are targets for its effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cir, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Good GY effect to special summon a BA monster. (BA = Burning Abyss)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Libic, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: If sent to the GY, it gives you a free special summon from hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Farfa, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Is a bit situational, but its effect can prove somewhat useful, especially for removing problem monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Graff, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Special summons a BA monster from deck if sent to GY, which can activate their effects from the GY if you control non BA monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Scarm, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Adds a level 3 DARK Fiend to hand if sent to GY, but it only occurs during the End Phase, so it is at 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Lair Of Darkness: One of the biggest pieces of this deck. It allows you to tribute opponent’s monsters to activate effects that require tributes, such as Lilith, Lady Of Lament, and your Virus trap cards. It also generates a large number of tokens (potentially), allowing you to use them for your tribute summons.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Allure Of Darkness: Really good draw power for DARK monster oriented decks.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Terraforming: Used to search Lair Of Darkness.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x The Monarchs Stormforth: Used in order to tribute your opponent’s monsters for the summon of your Wicked Gods.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Eradicator Epidemic Virus: A great trap card. You’ll be wanting to tribute your opponent’s monsters with Lair Of Darkness to use this card, however.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Grinning Grave Virus: Good way to remove problem monsters on your opponent’s field, and it blocks your opponent from using monsters that they draw.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence: A staple normal trap card for any deck like this.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Dante, Pilgrim Of The Burning Abyss: Used as a target for Beatrice, Lady Of The Eternal’s floating effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 77 The Seven Sins: Used to rank up from your Number 35 or Number 84.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS- Sky Thunder: What XYZ deck doesn’t use this card? It’s an incredible board wipe effect, and is very easy to summon.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe: Used to rank up from your rank 10 machines. (The names of them are all extremely long and I don’t want to type them out.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 84 Pain Gainer: Used to rank up from Number 35.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 81 Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora: First off, that’s one hell of a name, and secondly, this card is ran as a rank 10 with basic materials. Its protection effect is very useful.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max: Decent burn effect</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 35 Ravenous Tarantula: Good if you have either a major advantage or disadvantage in terms of LP. Its burn effect on special summons is very useful.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Beatrice, Lady Of The Eternal: Extremely good card that is a walking Foolish Burial, which is able to activate your BA monsters’ effects easily.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 48 Shadow Lich: One of my personal favorite cards, it has the ability to summon a token, which gives the card an attack buff and some protection.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 75 Bamboozling Gossip Shadow: Great effect, drawing cards in place of another monster’s effect is very versatile, it’s a shame this card doesn’t see more play.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Dante, Traveler Of The Burning Abyss: Very good card that is required for any BA deck. It allows you to mill 3 cards, which is incredibly useful for either deck thinning or using BA effects.</span>  &nbsp;  Number 49 Fortune Tune: Good level 3 support that recycles itself.  &nbsp;  <span>1x Beat Cop From The Underworld: If this card is summoned with DARK monsters as materials (which it VERY likely will), it gains an extra effect that tributes as cost, gaining some synergy with Lair Of Darkness. Also good for linking off BA monsters to take advantage of their GY effects.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cherubini, Ebon Angel Of The Burning Abyss: Allows you to send a BA to the GY for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Side Deck:</strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Barbar, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: In case you wanted more BA monsters in the deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Farfa, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Scarm, Malebranche Of The Burning Abyss: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Malicevorous Fork: Good special summon effect, but it isn’t in the Main Deck because of its level.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Leviair The Sea Dragon: Situational card that is useful against some decks.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 26 Spaceway Octobypass: Good effect to discourage your opponent from attacking.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: Good spot removal.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Foolish Burial: Staple spell that sends a monster to GY, which will likely be a BA.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Upstart Goblin: Yet another incredible staple spell card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Metaverse: Good for searching Lair Of Darkness, but not as useful as Terraforming.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Trap Trick: Used to search your other trap cards.</span>"

Despite a few flaws (S/T and Monster removal, disruptive effects), it has a lot of strengths in it that I've been looking for in a deck for quite some time now. Example: every single Virtual World normal deck monster (with the exeption of Nyannyan) can Special Summon themselves from the hand AND mill a card. The Spells and the Trap have great effects (even if I wish Qinglong's effect was able to be activated on your opponent's turn), with the Trap being a great recycler on the field and and both Spells pulling out great search effects. There were a few issues with consistency I had to fix, but overall this deck is amazing! (Notice: I've been waiting for this archetype to be released in the TCG since I saw it release in the OCG. Also notice: I am biased towards Wyrm- and/or Psychic-based archetypes).</span>  Now onto the part that people actually care about: how to play with this deck. Typically, you want to start with at 1 Virtual World Spell (typically Kauwloon) and at least 1 (but preferably 2) Virtual World monsters. I also know this isnt necessarily gonna happen every time. So, enter the Foolish Spells. With Foolish Burial you'll want to send Shaddoll Beast to the GY for a draw. With Foolish Burial Goods you'll want to mill Qinglong in order to banish it for a search (notice you'll have to discard a card). Then, you use the Virtual World monsters effects (except for Nyannyan, of course) to Special Summon themselves. If you need to mill a monster, mill Nyannyan, since she's the only one with a GY effect. If you mill a Spell, Qinglong. And there's only 1 option for Trap, so don't even ask.  As far as Extra Deck monsters go, I typically go for Kyubi first, because he can revive himself and has a good disruption effect. Next, you'll want an Xyz monster (typically Longlong or Fanfan) so that you can get Zeus out during the 2nd Main Phase if you're going second. If you're going first, aim for Jiujiu (and get him out first so you're material isn't banished) or, if possible, Shaddoll Winda (this would require two Shaddoll monsters and Shaddoll Fusion in your hand for a first-turn summon, though). Or you could get Longlong, since he'll basically oust any future Ash Blossoms and such. If you want to go for Trishula, though, that's fine by me. Especially first turn, that could be pretty devesting. Maybe.  Of course, as far as singular boss monsters go, you have True King of All Calamities, Kyubi and Zeus. If you get all three of these out... uh... I don't want to be facing you.  Hopefully you found this explaination helpful. Feel free to modify and/or comment on this deck (I'm always looking for pointers on deck building). Also, I know there's only 6 hand traps. I just felt that it was more consistant without the Nibirus I had in here previously. And I know I said last time I'd get both a Pendulum Fusion and Insect deck uploaded. That didn't happen, obviously. The Pendulum deck wound up becoming Dogmatika-Shaddoll and I never got around to the Insects. If you want me to do those, let me know in a comment. Thank you!"

All of you probably know how pk works so I won't write the strategy, instead I'll write the changes  -  I cut one stained greaves as 2 is enough and three is too many  - I cut one Graff and one Cir  -I got rid of Farfa as it was never actually useful  -I cut scapegoat as I only later realized that It couldn't be used to summon Unicorn  -I cut one fog blade and instead I put another shade brigandine as this version of the deck does not require only level 3's. Also fog blade is searchable of Bardiche and you never need more than one in your hand  - I also cut the Sword as it is unnecessary in the deck  - I cut Beatrice, Dante and one Cherubini. Dante and Beatrice are no longer necessary in this variation and I still play one copy Cherubini as he is still required.  -Instead I added Isolde, second copy of Break Sword, and Time thief Redoer  -I added United we Stand, D.D.R, Phoenix Blade, and Moon Mirror Shield to send of isolde  - Also I kept the Raidraptors as I think they are good but if you don't want to you certainly don't have to play them  - I kept the Handtraps as they are but I added a strong side deck  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The rules was that 67.5 of the main, side, and extra deck had to be 67.5 of one archtype. For 41 cards that is 27 in the main. In the extra deck, that is about 10-11 cards from one archtype. I was deciding between sky strikers, and raidraptors, but decided raidraptors bcause they can do a lot of broken things, and easily end games.With just Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius, and Raidraptor- Vanishing Lanius, you can end on Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon, D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga on opponents turn, Gagagaga Magician, Cyber Dragon Infinity and The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche. As long as you can get a way to get to Raidraptor- Wise Strix( The link monster), and a level four monster, you can get full combo.  If people have questions, or suggestion please put them in the comment section, and I will try to answer questions asap, and I will listen to suggestions.  At the end of the tournament I was 8-2, where the two loses were when I went first. The first lost against Charmers, my opponent Village of the Spellcaster me, and bounced my cards back to my hand. The second lost against Mayakashi, I was just dumb, and forget about my set Soulshave force until it was too late, and during their turn, they otked me since my lifepoints were very low.  It was a fun tournament, and I would definitely do it again.  &nbsp;"

Until we see some more Marincess Spell Cards, this deck is going to remain non-viable in the mainstream and won't enter the Meta.  Nevertheless, the idea is to push forward with a huge combo play into one of the big Marincess Link Monsters (either Marbled Rock, Wonder Heart, Great Bubble Reef) it actually doesn't matter, they each bring forward their own play style after the main combo. Wonder Heart can act as an extender following turn one, Great Bubble Reef much the same, and Marbled Rock has some great protection on top of the field spell.  Splash Mage can act as an amazing extender either in the middle of the Marciness combo or when you flip for Transcode Talker.  Always use Micro Coder to fetch Cynet Conflict when heading into summoning a Code Talker monster as it can seriously cripple decks like Invoked, Zombie World, Buster Blader, and a lot of others as it not only banishes the card, but prevents your opponent from activating it again that turn. In heavy combo decks this straight just stops their entire turn. Balancer Lord can act as a really good searcher and extender with Cynet Backdoor as you can fetch a smaller Cyberse monster and summon it too thanks to his double summon effect.  A lot of the combo speaks for itself. Going into the following turns after the first, the idea is to head into Shootingcode Talker, use it as material for Transcode, and then bring it right back from the GY with his effect. Set up your arrows correctly and you'll have three very beefy monsters with the ability to attack your opponent enough to destroy them. Protect the field spell at all costs and winning should be easy enough to pull off - beware that due to the excessive Link summoning, this deck can't keep going indefinitely, eventually you'll run out of resources.  Crusadia Arboria is a great way to play Synchro as well, I personally use Stardust Dragon as another layer of protection for both the field spell and anything else I might need. Trishula is also available to stay on top of your opponent's options."

You can then infinitely fusion summon by banishing cards from your hand, deck, field, or GY, and defeat your opponent with effect damage from Blaze Fenix.  Basically, you stall with cards like Threatening Roar and Battle Fader, while searching out Chain Material and Fusion Gate with cards like Trap Trick and Terraforming. Then, after you have the combo pieces, you set Chain Material and protect it if you can with Timidity until the next turn. Then, you activate both Chain Material and Fusion Gate. Fusion Gate allows you to fusion summon any amount of time per turn, and Chain Material allows you to use material from pretty much anywhere.  After you get this combo, you fusion summon. A lot. I start with a Dark Dragoon or two to stop your opponent from doing anything, then I get 1 Blaze Fenix, use its ability, get the 2nd using the first as material, and then the 3rd the same way. If you haven't killed your opponent yet, get Elemental HERO Electrum, shuffling all banished cards back into the deck, and repeat. If your opponent has something like a D/D/D Oracle King D'arc, then you have to take that out using Dark Dragoon's ability or Volcannon. If your opponent has a Dimension Gardian-ed D/D/D Oracle King D'arc, then I'm sorry but I can't really help you, except by requesting you add some Heavy Storm Dusters or Twin Twisters to the deck.  Anyway, that's pretty much it. I just filled the Side Deck with some nice hand traps, so there isn't really much to say about it.  Oh, actually, forgot about one thing. Raging Flame Sprite is not only good for fusion summoning Blaze Fenix, and can be pretty good by itself if you can stall until it has over 4000 ATK with its own ability."

Turbo Dragoon : P,"<div> <div class=""resolved"" data-reactroot=""""></div> </div> It's a Zombie World deck with a ton of discard and many ways to get into the pieces you need while saying ""NO"" to your opponent. The strat is simple... Set up with Zombie World, Rivalry, Doomking Balerdroch, and Dragoon and you got yourself a solid board. You could use Impermanence in the place of Gravedigger's Trap Hole, but I believe that this card really makes this control deck fly a lot smoother by making your opponent that much weaker for using their hand, grave, or banished monster effects. I also think that Santa Claws would be a good addition to this list because its effect is activated during your opponent's end phase, which is respondable by Doomking and/or Dragoon. Let me know what you all think! Happy Thanks Giving! <div></div>"

But in case you have bad cards or your opponent negates an important combo move, it provides a lot of protection to last more rounds. Uses a lot of special summoning to get monsters to the field, graveyard and back to the field. When Sangan or Witch of the Black Forest is sent to the graveyard and you can add 1 monster to your hand, instead of always drawing an exodia piece, when you see that you can draw another monster that enables to start a combo then go for it because the combo will allow you to end up with more pieces. When you combo right you can draw 4 exodia pieces in 1 turn. Always try to get a card that starts a combo, one wrong added card can lose you the duel. The Kuribohs are very important both for protection and special summoning, very effective with Emisarry of the Afterlife since his effect is not once per turn. Weak against decks that summon a monster that can negate once per turn and against mystic mine. But in case of a match the side deck has useful cards to go against these decks in the next duel."

Use Pot of Avarice and J of Avarice to return cards back to deck, since you can get rid of most of your deck in one turn with Lightsworn engine.

Big wind handtrap slot (for Wynn fodder, making us have 9 starters with Ice/Gl","Obvious synergy between the new Diamond Bell and Trickstar cus Trickstar burn multiple times triggering Diamond Bell pop twice. Gizmek Uka also burn multiple times while locking your opponent with Barrier Statue. Ratio is explainable, we run the Ice and Glass Bell at 3 cus they generate advantage easily, 2 Freeze and Snow Bell cus we can summon them more than once later, only 1 Blizzard Bell and Chime cus they only do a little. As for Chime, we only run small pool of Windwitch which means hard to meet its condition (even fulfilled, most of the Windwitches we run already generate advantage, so no point for Chimes). The rest of the deck is just good wind monster (handtraps), so Wynn has bigger chance to activate.  Uka can be triggered by the top tier that use Halq, Titaniklad, Scarlet Sanguine, any Prank-Kids, Adaman, Zoodiac Barrage, Thunder Dragonroar, and Emergency Teleport. The interaction however, only good against certain matchup depends on Uka's summon target.  Pros: Consistent interruption control with big handtrap lineup.  Cons: No recursion, longevity depends on what we draw (double Ice/Glass Bell), although the duel is cut shorter thanks to the cheap burn damage."

Powerful Cards Like <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> only can use their on-board effects on an opponent’s already established board. This build takes advantage of two main cards <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a>.  <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> lets you discard it and a Nekroz ritual spell to stop your opponent from special summoning from the extra deck during Main Phase 1. Since a player can’t enter battle phase and therefore main phase 2 turn 1, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> is electively a hand trap version of <a data-name=""Domain of the True Monarchs"">Domain of the True Monarchs</a> turn 1. Also every Nekroz ritual spell lets you banish itself and one Nekroz monster to search another ritual spell, giving you back much needed value when discarded with <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a>.  <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> is an often underutilized tool that has the following effect on field: “Your opponent cannot activate cards or effects in response to the activation of a ""Nekroz"" Ritual Spell Card“ And “""Nekroz"" Ritual Monsters you control cannot be targeted by an opponent's card effects“. This card lets you play around negates that would stop your ritual summons. <a data-name=""Dance Princess of the Nekroz"">Dance Princess of the Nekroz</a> combined with a ritual summon of <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> can easily disarm your opponent’s monster negates, without them being able to stop it. Its effect when tributed, while not the main reason for its usage in the deck is also relevant allowing for recycling of resources in longer games. It also should be noted that as this card is a level 4 water monster it aids in making <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> and then <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>.  The Dogmatika engine in the deck serves a dual purpose going second. It first searches out Nekroz cards by sending <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> to grave. It also provides additional card destruction and presence through sending <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> to grave multiple times. For example, <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> can result in a total of two card destructions and a search by searching for and setting up <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>. This engine Combines the searching and board presence of the Impcantation archetype with board clearing.  The Deck also utilizes cards <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>. These function as a standard blowout package and can simply dismantle in one un-interactable sweep.  <strong>The Math and Consistency</strong>  While it’s not perfect odds, this deck is optimized to have some form of blowout over about 90% of the time. The Deck will simply draw one of <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>, <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a>, or <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> around 79.85% of the time. That’s a healthy base for going second but what else does it have? The deck opens <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> and a ritual spell in 18.56% of games, that’s about 1 out of every 5 where your opponent can’t use their extra deck to set up negates to stop your ritual summons.  Outside of these blowouts let’s look at Nekroz’s inherent searchability. 10/42 cards in the deck search another nekroz card with no questions asked. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Brionac"">Nekroz of Brionac</a> gets you any Nekroz Monster which gets you <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a> who in turn gets you any Nekroz Ritual spell. Another 16/42 cards search Nekroz cards with a bit of setup. Due to Nekroz’s heavily search reliant playstyle it’s very hard to calculate how many negates on average this deck can play through. From personal experience being able to play through 1 negate is almost guaranteed, 2 negates is common enough, and 3 negates can be done with a lucky enough hand.  <strong>Side Deck and Extra Deck.</strong>  This deck struggles quite a lot against non-extra deck focused decks. Thats not to say its unwinnable but that’s what the side deck is for. We run a backrow destruction package in the form of <a data-name=""Harpie’s feather Duster"">Harpie’s feather Duster</a> and Three copies of <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>. The rest of the cards enable the deck to be played going first. The additional copies <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyrus"">Nekroz of Valkyrus</a> are there for the classic nekroz play of setting up a floodgate with <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> style battle protection. <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a> and <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> combine with any spellcaster Nekroz monster just shuts down any spell-based deck. Last but not least <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> is an easy disruption card for Nekroz to play with as more often than not only one of each type of monsters will be on the field at once.  Most of the Extra deck is focused around enabling <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a> and <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>. <a data-name=""Herald of the Ark Light"">Herald of the Ark Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> are commonly used for effects when ritual summoning. The full <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> combo will send two <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> and one <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light to Grave"">Herald of the Arc Light to Grave</a>. <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> also has a relevant graveyard effect for recursion.  Everything else was chosen because they either recycle themselves or can not be special summoned off of an opponent’s <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> type effects. I also tried to set these up to play around not giving Light and Fire attributes to <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, but several levels didn’t feature enough monsters to do this Perfectly. <a data-name=""Nepthys, The Sacred Flame"">Nepthys, The Sacred Flame</a>, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>, and <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> are all situation tools the deck can use.  <strong>Relevant Matchups</strong>  <em>Dragon Link &amp; Infernoble Knights</em> – This deck forgoes most hand traps in favor of blowouts. The Goal is simple drop a board clear or negate and then resolve a <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> or <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> to keep them out of the game and destroy their resources.  <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> stops these decks from doing anything. If you have to play through negates bait with Nekroz Ritual spells and monsters first as they are recursive.  <em>Virtual World</em> – Admittedly <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> is a problem for this deck to deal with. The solution lies in going first. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> or <a data-name=""Nekroz of Clausolas"">Nekroz of Clausolas</a> are an easy play here. Cards like <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Torrent"">Barrier Statue of the Torrent</a>, <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spell Casters"">Secret Village of the Spell Casters</a> and <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> are easy side deck options here. If you have to play through <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> just see if you can remove it and stop them from making another one.  Your options vary greatly depending on what attribute they call. If they chose light nekroz search effects are live if they chose water <a data-name=""Elder Entity N’tss"">Elder Entity N’tss</a> and <a data-name=""Hearld of the Arc Light"">Hearld of the Arc Light</a> can still resolve. Also, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> stops this deck from doing anything turn one.  <em>Zoodiac </em>- Tons of options in this matchup. If they make you first <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore</a> stops their game plan entirely. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> also works going first here Now you can search it and the needed discard fodder to cancel out their plan of making <a data-name=""Zoodiac Boarbow"">Zoodiac Boarbow</a> and making <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder</a>. If they play <a data-name=""Alpha, the Master of Beasts"">Alpha, the Master of Beasts</a> try to make two <a data-name=""Nekroz of Unicore"">Nekroz of Unicore </a>to stop them from playing through one. Going second gives you a pretty solid advantage. They’re likely to only end on one monster to play around <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> and <a data-name=""the Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode"">the Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode</a>, and just depend on backrow instead. <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> and <a data-name=""Harpie’s Feather Duster"">Harpie’s Feather Duster</a> are your friends here. You don’t have a lot of outs to <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"">Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</a>, so stop them from making it in the first place instead. Also, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> stops this deck from doing anything turn one.  <em>Dinosaurs</em> – This deck is very likely to run through you if you go first. Nekroz and Dogmatika are anti-extra deck engines and dino’s often don’t need theirs. <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Valkyus"">Nekroz of Valkyus</a> a very effective side deck option here. Almost always side out <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a>. Going second you can run through them but make sure to target gas cards like <a data-name=""Miscellaneosaurus"">Miscellaneosaurus</a> with <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> if you can’t OTK.  <em>Eldlich</em> – Theres a lot of varaity in this deck. General goal is to try and use <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trisula"">Nekroz of Trisula</a> to try and banish all copies of <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>. <a data-name=""Nekroz of Gungir"">Nekroz of Gungir</a> is your friend in this match up as Nekroz don’t have a ton of backrow removal on their own. Side in <a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> and <a data-name=""Harpies Feather Duster"">Harpies Feather Duster</a>. Side out <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a> and <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra – Sphere Mode</a>, and <a data-name=""Nekroz of Sophia"">Nekroz of Sophia</a> if they’re not playing an extra deck focused build.  <strong>Side Note</strong>  This deck is an edit of a previous deck I made found here.  https://ygoprodeck.com/go-second-nekroz/  Most of the relevant mathematical value have been increased by only 1-2% but added all together in makes a dramatic difference. The real value comes from the added cards in the Dogmatika engine which gives more value and helps better play through negates and the swap for <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> which is more in line with the deck’s focus."

What could possibly go wrong?,"<span>Hey, I’m back with my horrible ideas! I’m not sure if you remember this Cyber Dragon engine I came up with, but here it is again, this time in Orcust! If you want to see the Ancient Gear/Cyber Dragon deck, check it out <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/ancient-gear-cyber-dragon-engine/"">here</a>. I will be explaining my choices of cards, and why I play them. Starting with…</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher: Starting off with Gizmek Orochi, this monster is played for a couple of reasons. One being that it is easy to summon, and its summoning condition of banishing cards from the top of the deck isn’t much of a hindrance to this deck. Its level and attribute match up well with the Orcust cards, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x World Legacy- “World Wand”: The card is primarily used for its banishing effect once in the GY, and not its effect when sent. However, it is a good idea to use it if you happen to have another copy in hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcust Knightmare: This is a one of, due to its status as a garnet. You won’t be wanting to see this card in your hand, and want it in your GY. Send it with cards like Foolish Burial, as this is one of the better targets for it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Cyber Dragon: The most important card of the Cyber Dragon engine, this card’s amazing effect gives you an edge when going second.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight: Definitely the best Orcust main deck monster. This card’s summon effect is great, and you’ll want to take advantage of it the best you can. Especially its bonus effect of summoning a token. You won’t usually be taking advantage of its effect to make itself a tuner, however, as you’ll be linking this card off.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Dark Grepher: The much better version of Armageddon Knight, this card’s ability to special summon itself is easy to abuse in this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Armageddon Knight: Its effect to send a DARK monster to the GY for free is amazing, and you’ll want to take advantage of this the best you can.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcust Cymbal Skeleton: Its GY effect is great, but the fact that it locks you into DARK monsters (along with Orcust Brass Bombard) means that you’ll want to set up your Cyber Dragon plays first.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Scrap Recycler: Its ability to send a Machine, instead of plainly a DARK monster, makes it function as a better Armageddon Knight in this deck. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Cyber Dragon Core: The card that makes the entire Cyber Dragon Engine function. Normal Summon this, and add your Cyber Emergency to add a regular Cyber Dragon to hand. Or, add Cyber Revysystem if you already have a Cyber Dragon in hand. Then, link it off or summon a Chimeratech fusion monster.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Knightmare Corruptor Iblee: You’ll be wanting to send this card to the GY in order to lock your opponent out of special summons, or to set up some plays with Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcust Brass Bombard: Its GY effect is great, but the fact that it locks you into DARK monsters (along with Orcust Cymbal Skeleton) means that you’ll want to set up your Cyber Dragon plays first.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cyber Pharos: This card has an easy to fulfill summoning condition, and a great effect, which can allow you to summon a machine fusion monster, using materials from the hand or field. The target you’ll be trying to go for is Cyber Eternity Dragon, as it is an incredible card in this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcustrated Babel: Its effect to make Orcust cards have quick effects is great, however it doesn’t do much else to justify having it at more than just a 1 of.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Allure Of Darkness: An incredible card for any Orcust deck, this card lets you draw 2 cards AND banish a DARK monster from your hand (which will usually be an Orcust card). There is very little downside to this card in Orcust.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Cyber Emergency: Part of the Cyber Dragon engine, this card is used to add a Cyber Dragon (or Cyber Dragon Core in some circumstances) to your hand.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Cyber Revysystem: Part of the Cyber Dragon Engine. Use this to special summon your Cyber Dragons from the hand or GY to use them for link or fusion plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Foolish Burial: An incredible staple card that is a must have for any Orcust deck (or any deck that wants cards in the GY).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Orcustrated Return: Same reasons as Allure Of Darkness, however you have to discard an Orcust for its effect, and it is a hard once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Eternity Dragon: This card is going to be your main target for Cyber Pharos. It’s an incredible beatstick, and will likely beat over most cards your opponent throws at it. Its floating effect is pretty good too, and its banish effect, while not seeing as much use in this deck, is still notable.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon: The best Chimeratech card; this lets you remove problem cards such as Accesscode Talker or Apollousa from your opponent’s field for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Invoked Mechaba: This card is used as the target for Cyber Dragon Nova’s floating effect. It may be situational, but it is quite useful if that situation were to ever arise.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Dingirsu, The Orcust of the Evening Star: Really easy summoning condition to fulfill, whether you bring it out properly or through its effect. You’ll be wanting to keep this card on the board as long as possible.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova: You’ll be summoning this card with 2 Cyber Dragons. The card itself isn’t very important, except for its floating effect, which you’ll be summoning Invoked Mechaba with.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova: You will ALWAYS use the alternative summoning condition for this card. It has an incredible non-destruction removal effect, and its negate is also incredible. Not to mention it’s impressive body, and you have one very hard to remove card on your hands.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Orcustrion: The card can be a pain to summon for not much of a payoff. However, its removal effect is quite decent.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Longirsu, The Orcust Orchestrator: This card is basically the much better version of Orcustrion. It’s easier to summon, and has the same effect. Please, use this over Orcustrion.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: What hasn’t been said about this card already? It has an incredible non-destruction removal effect, and is very easy to summon.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Sieger: This card’s main use is to boost your cards, namely Dingirsu, to make them massive beatsticks.

It is fun, and can win you games.","This the raidraptor deck that I used to participate in CryptidYgo's Writer Guild Revel's Tournament.The rules was that 67.5 of the main, side, and extra deck had to be 67.5 of one archtype. For 41 cards that is 27 in the main. In the extra deck, that is about 10-11 cards from one archtype. I looked at many decks including sky strikers, raidraptors, cyber dragons, and even ancient gears. In the end I choose raidraptors, because I was comfortable with them, and they made good boards. Also they were very consistent. This deck wants to go first, and set up its board. With just Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius, and Raidraptor- Vanishing Lanius, you can end on Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon, D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga on opponents turn, Gagagaga Magician, Cyber Dragon Infinity and The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche. As long as you can get a way to get to Raidraptor- Wise Strix( The link monster), and a level four monster, you can get full combo. A video of me doing a test hand will be coming soon.  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMvWc8q_mXY&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>  This was a small tournament, and I go 4-0 in the swiss rounds. In the top cuts I go against charmer, and mayakashis.  The first round of top cut against charmers, I win the dice roll, and go first. I manage to set up my board without any interruption and win. The second game, my opponent goes first, and sets up a board with Village of the Spellcasters, which means there is nothing I can do, so I surrender. The last game was much like the first game.  In the finals, I go against a Mayakashi player that I faced in swiss. I was lucky, and won the dice roll. The first game I got my board, and negated all of my opponents  effects during their turn, and otked them. The second game I go second, and I could have won, if I wasn't dumb, and forget to activate my set Rank-Up- Magic Soul Shave Force earlier in the turn to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity to take their Mayakashi link three. This leads me to get OTKed after losing half my lifepoints plus not reading card effects and losing 1000 more.This leads me getting hit by Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi for game. The last game, I go first, and set up my board, and otk them the following turn.  In the end I won the tournament with a 8-2 record.  In conclusion, the tournament was fun, and I highly recommend people checking out the discord for future events.  It's ""The Yugioh Writers Guild""  <span>Monsters-27</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius-</span><span> This can is very important because this can send any Raidraptor card from your deck to your graveyard. You usually send Raidraptor- Mimicry Lanius, or Raider’s Wing. However a cool interaction with Raidraptor- Heel Eagle is that if you have Heel Eagle in your hand, you can normal summon Tribute Lanius, and send any Raidraptor spell or trap, and special summon Heel Eagle, and go into Wise Strix. After using Wise Strix’s effect, you can banish Heel Eagle, and add to your hand the spell or trap that was sent. The second of this effect doesn’t come up since you usually xyz or link with Tribute Lanius before the second main phase.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Stangle Lanius-</span><span> This card is a once per turn special summon if you control a dark monster. If you special summon this card from your hand, you can still use its effect to special summon a  level 4 or lower raidraptor from your graveyard when a xyz monster you control that has a dark xyz monster under it is on the field. During the combo, you summon this off of Raidraptor- Arsenal Falcon.  Don’t forget that if you use the summon from the graveyard effect, you are locked into darks which isn’t that bad.</span>  <span><span>Dynatherium-</span> </span><span>I run this card because I had one slot open, and this card is a free special summon going first or second. The only drawback is that your opponent then can special summon a level 4 monster from either player’s graveyard. However,if you go first and this is in your opening hand, the drawback isn’t an issue. Surprisingly at one copy this card came into my hand more often than not.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Tribute Lanius-</span><span>This can is a free special summon of a level 4 or low Raidraptor from the hand. You use this special summon Raidraptor monster like Mimicry, Tribute Lanius, or any other Raidraptor cards that can’t special summon themselves. The best thing about this card is that it’s once per turn, so if you open two, you can use both of their effects. </span>  <span>Raidraptor- Mimicry Lanius-</span><span> While this card doesn’t special summon itself, and it doesn’t have a good normal summon effect, this card is still needed. If you send this card to the graveyard, the turn it was sent, you can banish it to add any Raidraptor card from your deck. Its other effect is that it can increase the level of all raidraptor monsters by one, but that doesn’t come up at all. </span>  <span><span>Raidraptor- Singing Lanius-</span> </span><span>This card is only a free special summon, when you control a face up XYZ monster. You usually search this with Force Strix so you can special summon it right away. Honestly I would play one of it since it’s searchable, and can’t freely special summon itself.</span>  <span><span>Raider’s Wing-</span> </span><span>This card can special itself out by detaching a material from a Dark xyz monster you control. This is good because you can special summon it off of Raidraptor- Wise Strix, use it for xyz material, then special summon it back using its effect. Also if it leaves the field after using its effect it’s banished. You get around this by reusing it as a xyz material so when it's sent to the graveyard it isn’t banished.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Heel Eagle-</span><span> This card can special summon itself from your hand, if all monsters you control are Raidraptors. This is good, because you want to get three monsters on the board. Three monsters equal full combo. Its second effect where it can banish itself from the graveyard to add a Raidraptor spell/ trap from your graveyard doesn’t come up often but it’s something that is useful.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knight of Silent Boot- </span><span>This card as you know is the only brick. I mean if you draw it, it hurts the combo, because then you can’t go into Arsenal Falcon without Magic Force. The reason that I run two is because in case I draw one, there is still one in my deck.</span>  <span><span>Caligo Claw Crow-</span> </span><span>This card is so good, because it's a free winged beast that can special summon itself if you control a dark monster. You can use this card for Wise Strix which gets your combo started. If this wasn’t once per turn, or if it was level 4 it would be more broken.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Pain Lanius-</span><span> This card can special summon itself by targeting one Raidraptor monster that has a level. You take damage equal to the lower of the monster’s stats, and then special summon this card. This card then becomes the level of the monster. You can’t target Raider’s Wing because you have to take damage, and Raider’s Wing lowest stat is 0. Therefore you don’t damage , and it doesn’t work. Also on a side note, this card can only be used as a xyz material for a winged beast monster.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Note- If you count the number of monsters that can special summon themselves, you get 16 which means that 59% of the monsters are extenders.</span>  <span>Spell-10</span>  <span>Raidraptor-Nest-</span><span> This card can add any Raidraptor monster from your deck or graveyard if you control two or more Raidraptor monsters. This card is good, because it can search extra extenders without locking you into Raidraptors. You could run this at one, since it’s searchable off of Mimicry.</span>  <span>Foolish Burial-</span><span> This card is neat, because it can send Raider’s Wing or Raidraptor- Mimicry. If your opponent negates the Wise Strix, you can use foolish to send the Raider’s Wing, and continue your combo making your opponent waste a handtrap. Also you could send Mimicry to get any Raidraptor card from your deck to your hand.</span>  <span>Harpie’s Feather Duster-</span><span> This card is for backrow decks, and annoying field spells. In testing and the tournament, I found that I need some trap backrow destruction in case my opponent plays  Secret Village of the Spellcaster.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Call-</span><span> This card can target a Raidraptor monster, and special summon another one from the deck. While this is good, the bad part of this is that it locks you into Raidraptor. Therefore I never used this card in the tournament, and I probably would have cut it, and added more of the counter trap.</span>  <span><span>Rank- Up-Magic Soul Shave Force-</span> </span><span>This card is used to summon Cyber Dragon Infinity by paying half your life points. If you don’t want to make Infinity, you could also make True King of Calamities.</span>  <span>Phantom Knights’ Rank-Up- Magic Force-</span><span> This card is great because it can target any dark xyz monster, and rank it up equal to the number of dark monsters you banish from your graveyard. This makes Raidraptor- Arsenal Falcon. The reason we play two is because, if the game lasts more than three turns, you can go into Revolution Falcon to pop a monster, and deal damage, or Satellite Cannon Falcon to destroy all of your opponent's backrow, and weaken your opponent's monsters.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch- </span><span>This card is used to summon Kali Yuga on your opponent's turn. It’s graveyard effect can attach a Phantom Knight monster from your hand to a Dark xyz monster you control.</span>  <span>Traps-4</span>  <span>Raidraptor’s Phantom Knights Claw- </span><span>This is a counter trap that can negate a monster effect by detaching a material from a dark xyz monster you control. Then one Raidraptor xyz monster gains attack equal to the attack of the monster.</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Readiness-</span><span> While this card is useful, it is not required in the deck. It makes your Raidraptor monster indestructible by battle for one turn, and it can banish itself from the graveyard to make you take no battle damage that turn. You can activate both effects on the same turn if needed.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine-</span><span> What this card does, is that if you have no traps in the graveyard, then you can activate it the turn you set it to be a normal level four monster. This is great, because you can use it for xyz summoning, and it isn’t a dead card in your opening hand. To top that, if you already have one of the rank up spells, you can add this off of silent boots.</span>  <span>Extra Deck-15</span>  <span>Raidraptor- Ultimate Falcon-</span><span> This can is unaffected by everything, and you summon it off of Arsenal Falcon being destroyed by its own effect, or your opponent’s effect. This card is a baby Zexal on your turn, because if you detach one material, it makes your opponent monsters lose 1000 attack and defense, and prevents your opponent from activating effects for the rest of the turn. It’s other effect is that if it has a Raidraptor monster underneath, during the end phase it makes all of your opponent monster’s lose 1000 attack. If your opponent doesn’t have a face up monster you can burn your opponent for 1000. That is useful, if you are playing into time.</span>  <span><span>D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga-</span> </span><span>This card is the win condition of the deck. You summon this card on your opponent’s turn using Rank-Up Magic Launch in order to negate all of your opponent’s on field effects. Its second effect is that it has a quick effect heavy storm to destroy all spells and traps on the field.</span>  <span>Raidraptor - Satellite Cannon Falcon- </span><span>This card is here for later in the game if you need to destroy all of your opponent's spell and traps. Also it can detach a material to target one opponent monster and make it lose 800 for each Raidraptor monster in your graveyard.</span>  <span>Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcón-</span><span>This rank 7 xyz monster can detach one material to special summon anyone Raidraptor monster from your deck. The good thing about this is that it doesn’t negate the monster’s effect. Also if it’s sent to the graveyard it can summon out any Raidraptor xyz monster.</span>  <span><span>Cyber Dragon Infinity-</span> </span><span>This is the card, you usually summon with Soul Shave Force. This card can attach one attack position monster to it, and it can negate one card by detaching one material from it. </span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon-</span> This card is usually summoned off of Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon. Its effect includes detaching one material to attack all monsters, and if it attacks a special summoned monster, it makes the monster’s attack 0. Another effect that it has is that if it has a Raidraptor xyz monster, it can destroy one monster your opponent controls and deal damage equal to halve the attack.</span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon - Air Raid-</span> This is the rank 6 that you summon if you played Strangle Lanius, since it locks you into darks.The alternative way to summon this card is by discarding a rank up magic spell and ranking it on a rank 5 or lower Raidraptor monster. This card doesn’t have a negate, but when it’s summoned it can destroy one monster your opponent controls, and deal damage to your opponent. Also if it is destroyed it floats into Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon - Air Raid</span>  <span>Ice Beast Zerofyne-</span><span> I like this card because it can negate the effects of all face up cards that your opponent controls. This is useful because it can negate floodgates, and other annoying cards.</span>  <span><span>Gagagaga Magician-</span> </span><span>This card is solely used to bring back Arsenal Falcon to make Kali Yuga.</span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Blade Burner Falcon-</span> This card can gain 3000 attacks if the difference between your and your opponent's life points is 3000 or more. This card can be used to crash into Dragoon, or attack a weaker monster and pop up to two cards when using its effect.</span>  <span><span>Raidraptor - Force Strix-</span> </span><span>This card is essential to the deck, because it searches the deck for any level 4 Dark winged beast. This card allows you to add more extenders to combo off.This card is a soft once per turn meaning that each copy can add a dark winged beast once per turn.</span>  <span>The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche-</span><span> This card can pop cards if a dark xyz monster is special summoned to a zone this card points to. That is nice, but the reason that this was banned was because it can send a Phantom Knight card to the graveyard to set a phantom knight spell or trap.This sends Silent Boots to get more advantage. Side note, if for some reason you draw both Silent Boots, you could alway send Raider’s Wing since it is a Raidraptor, and Phantom Knight card.</span>  <span>Raidraptor - Wise Strix- </span><span>This card can special summon a level 4 dark winged beast from the deck, negating its effect. That  monster can’t be used as a link monster, but that doesn’t matter when you are going to use it as xyz material. Its other effect is that when a Raidraptor xyz monster activates its effect, you can set one rank up spell card. Even if it’s a quick play, you still can use it the turn you set it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side deck- For the side deck, it is up to each individual person, and what the meta currently is. My suggestion is to run backrow removal like twin twisters, and heavy storm duster in case your opponent has Secret Village of the Spellcasters. Also run hand traps like Nibiru, The Primal Being, Ash Blossom, or even Infinite Impermanence. Like I said before, the side deck is up to each individual person, so if you don’t like my suggestions that is perfectly ok.</span>"

In the opposing main phase the effect of <a data-name=""Condemned witch"">Condemned witch</a> is activated, tributing itself allows us to summon a fairy from the deck and we will summon <a data-name=""Holy Night Astel"">Holy Night Astel</a> which in turn we can tribute it, or even better <a data-name=""Holy Night Rayel"">Holy Night Rayel</a>, to summon our Dragon <a data-name=""Holy Night Seiyaryu"">Holy Night Seiyaryu</a>. <table>  <tr> <td><span>CONSIDERATIONS</span></td> </tr>  </table> <p>This is a deck that really has potential, but this, what I think about it and what supports it would need, I'll talk about in a video. The deck can be played in different ways but at the moment this is what convinced me the most or that I prefer.</p> <p>The win condition of the deck is that of running out of resources to our opponent, destroying his monsters key and thus preventing him from making combos, and subsequently attacking with our dragon.</p> <p>Unfortunately it's a fairly fragile deck especially for spell/traps, in fact it suffers too much <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> or similar.</p> <p><span><strong>The Cards:</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Holy Night Rayel"">Holy Night Rayel</a> is the most important card in the deck, a searcher for holy night spell/trap, and also when it is in the graveyard we banish it to summon <a data-name=""Holy Night Flamel"">Holy Night Flamel</a> or <a data-name=""Holy Night Astel"">Holy Night Astel</a>. Often remaining on the field uselessly we will use it to make an xyz or a link.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Radiant Seiyaryu"">Radiant Seiyaryu</a> is the monster on which the deck is based, when it is summoned by the hand it destroy a card on the field without limitation of opt. We try to have more than one copy of it in hand, so as to interchange them, even if we have 2 on the ground as long as we have the continuous spell/traps we don't want to do xyz rank 7 except in special cases. At the end of the opponent's turn we prefer to have it in hand but if it remains on the field is not a problem since it cannot be destroyed either by battle or effect, by darkness monsters.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a> we use it because in this version I play more spells than would normally be played in a Holy Night list, and some of them are useless in hand if we already control another, so <a data-name=""Summoner Monk"">Summoner Monk</a> allows us to discard a spell to summon from the deck any lv. 4 monster, usually <a data-name=""Holy Night Astel"">Holy Night Astel</a> or <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Havens"">Barrier Statue of the Havens</a>. And last but not least it helps us to summon from extra deck.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a>, I think it is the best pot to use in this deck, which needs to draw. When we use it, we can choose the cards to banish face down and this, is the main reason why we prefer it, to <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, in fact the extra deck is varied and we use it in some situations, against certain decks. Furthermore, among the 6 cards that we are going to see from the top of the deck, we will choose 1, often it will be enough for us to draw only 1 card, but exactly what we need.  <hr />  </li>  	<li><a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> is perfect paired with the <a data-name=""pot of Disparity"">pot of Disparity</a> as it does not suffer from the limitation given by the other pot, and the fact of not being able to summon especially does not affect us too much.</li> </ul> <table>  <tr> <td>SIDE DECK</td> </tr>  </table> <p>The Side can be really customizable, for example you can insert <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> with the various targets. In general I recommend using the light fairy.</p> <p><strong>Must Have:</strong></p> <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>, we use it to draw cards and to mainly protect spell/traps or the activation of important cards like <a data-name=""Holy Night Rayel"">Holy Night Rayel</a> or <a data-name=""Holy Night Bellfire"">Holy Night Bellfire</a>. Also it's a level 7 dragon that we can use to summon a rank 7 xyz and we can reborn it with <a data-name=""Return of the Dragon Lords"">Return of the Dragon Lords</a>.  Artifact set in which I play Artifact Dagda, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> are light Fairy really useful in this meta that integrate very well with the deck since we can destroy them with <a data-name=""Radiant Seiyaryu"">Radiant Seiyaryu</a>.  <a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a> fundamental to defend ourselves from opponent spell/traps.  <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> has the usual very useful use at times essential, and it's nice that, this deck usually takes different damage and therefore using red reboot, we go to halve our already low life points and therefore we lose less than 4000lp.  <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> is very nice in this deck, because most of the time, our opponent will control more monsters than us and so, we can use it to break one more card or why not, to summon a rank 7 xyz. <p><strong>Other cards you could use:</strong></p> <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">,</a> the third forbidden, very strong card, we add it to the deck against combo decks, obviously like breaking board. Let's not forget that it is searchable by <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch</a>.  <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>, hand trap very useful against some types of decks, you can replace it with any other ht or staple.  <hr /> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgjIzG1mTF8</p>"

The big Evil Twins monster is in the side deck in case you want to play it but I never felt like the deck needed it. It's not a good boss monster. Bagooska and Saros are nice techs that are both fiends and thus don't conflict with the restriction of the link-2.  Overall it's a pretty fun deck that can somewhat compete with the meta on a low rogue level. Have fun.

Here's one that's kind of alright for a semi-competitive format,There's no Elpy/guardragon. They are nice but they make the deck more linear and easier to stop. I prefer a more pure and adaptable version with no real chokepoint.  Dragonmaid Sheou is a great boss monster that litteraly comes back every turn. The deck has a hard time on the first turns but if you manage to go to the grind game you should be able to win. The deck can really hold the distance and keep the advantage.  It's a fun strategy. It needs some skill and good decision-making but it's solid.

Most decks just can't deal with it. The problem is getting it on the field.  Nothing revolutionary here, just a deck with what I think is a good ratio and some nice techs to get to Magnus trun 1.  The deck falls pretty easily to handtraps. It's far from competitive but well-piloted it thrives in a casual environment.  Take the time to test the combos. It's not easy at first, but it works. If uniterrupted, I personnaly manage to get to Magnus 6 materials turn 1 80% of the time."

Pot of Avarice, Raigeki, Daigusto Emeral and Honest as techs for grindgame-competency.  Cyber Dragon Nova and Invoked Mechaba as your usual anti-Dogmatika-tech.  Light on handtraps to allow for more archtype-internal control options, (all Magical Musketeer Monsters turn the Magical Musket spells/traps into handtraps anyways) also allows Magical Musketeer Kidbrave (and secondarily Magical Musketeer Wild &amp; Magical Musketeer Doc, aswell as Magical Musketeer Calamity) to be active and gaining advantage (or negating disadvantage) more often, this is accounted by only playing 1 Pot of Avarice, I'd opt for 2 in a handtrap-heavier version of this deck. (Running no Pot of Avarice takes a lot of grindgame-competency from this deck, as you will draw and search through your deck very rapidly)  I chose not to play Dark Ruler No More! and Evenly Matched as I believe this deck can do without blowouts like those.

SS Formula Synchron, SS Marcher, effect Marcher to summon back stone.  Step 3: Summon Elpy using stone, summon Protector Whelp using Marcher and Linkross.  Step 4: Effect Elpy to summon Seyfert/Brotaur (Seyfert priority). Effect Seyfert to discard Blue-eyes you drew using stone to grab Levianeer (Chaos Emperor if you have Levi onhand already, or Alternative if you have both)  Step 5: Summon Pisty using Seyfert.

Step 6: Summon Saryuja using the 3 link monsters and Levianeer. Banish Seyfert to put Levianeer back into your hand. Don't forget to Draw 4 put back 3.

The deck comes with an explanation for every card used in the deck.,"<span>Hey y’all! I’m back with another list! Today I have Traptrix, with some Paleozoic sprinkled into it! The deck is mainly focused around XYZ summoning (as 99% of my deck are lol), but has a few links, namely Traptrix Sera. Let’s start explaining the card choices, beginning with…</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Monsters:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Atrax: Definitely one of the best Traptrix monsters, this card hosts an impressive effect of protecting your normal traps from being negated, which will be incredible against countering many meta decks. More icing on the cake is the fact that it allows you to use your Hole normal traps straight from your hand instead of setting them onto the field, making them viable for destruction! This card is a staple 3 of in any Traptrix deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Dionaea: While the card may be god Traptrix support, as it can ss for free, it isn’t a card you want to open with, and thus is run only at 2. You’ll be wanting to use this card’s normal summon effect more than it’s special summon one, as it can lead to XYZ plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Myrmeleo: Really good search card for your traps, and its special summon allows you to pop a s/t for free, which will likely be followed by an XYZ play (considering that it’s most likely to be special summoned by another Traptrix monster).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traprix Mantis: While its search effect is extremely useful, it doesn’t do much else except offer a little bit of protection to your trap cards. And, Sera does what this card tries to do, but better. However, considering that the pool of Traptrix monsters is very, very limited, I run this at 2 to increase general consistency.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Genlisea: This card is great, as it can recover Hole trap cards from the GY, and search from the deck for very little cost. You’ll be wanting to abuse this card’s effect as much as you possibly can.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Nepenthes: While this card may, on paper, look like an extremely vital asset, it in reality is not. This is because the card is too slow, requiring you to activate a Hole trap card, instead of immediately special summoning/searching a Traptrix.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Bottomless Trap Hole: One of the most iconic Hole trap cards, maybe only next to Trap Hole itself (while looking through cards for this deck, by the way, Trap Hole is bugged to show Darkfall’s description when you hover over it). The card is one of the most useful traps in the deck, second to Infinite Impermanence and Paleozoic Dinomischus, as it allows for easy monster removal that doesn’t target, and banishes.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Gravedigger’s Trap Hole: This card is mainly used to protect your Traptrix Sera from pesky hand traps such as Ash Blossom. However, its effect allowing you to affect cards in the GY or that are banished is also extremely useful. The 2000 burn damage is also very nice to have.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence: This card is currently the best trap card in the format, functioning as both a hand trap, and a s/t negation if it was set to your field before activation. There is very little I can say about this card that hasn’t already been said. It’s an incredibly powerful metagame staple that is a required 3 of for any trap based deck, whether it be Traptrix or Paleo Frogs.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Network Trap Hole: A great Hole trap card, preventing summons from the deck and GY. However, it isn’t as useful as the above Bottomless Trap Hole, due to it not preventing most summons.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Canadia: Duel Links players probably got some PTSD from seeing this card’s name on this list! This card has a great way of removing problems without actually removing them. As well, since it is a Paleozoic trap card, it can special summon itself as a monster from the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Dinomischus: Dinomisc allows for some really easy removal, functioning as a better Bottomless Trap Hole in a way, as this card can banish ANY face up card, not just monsters. Also, the fact that it is a Paleozoic is great, as it can special summon itself, leading to potential rank 2 plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Olenoides: Really good s/t pop, functioning as this deck’s MST. It’s an extremely versatile trap card that is benefitted by the fact that it is a Paleozoic.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Trap Trick: Do I even need to say why this card is useful for this deck? This is one of the cards you want in your opening hand, as it can search any trap from your deck to immediately set to field, allowing it to be activated the turn it is set. Its sheer versatility in this deck makes it a requirement for this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare: A great negation trap card that will very likely receive a lot of use in your games.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus- Sky Thunder: I’m not very sure if I like the idea of placing a giant robot in a deck filled with insect/plant waifus, but it’s so good that leaving it out would be a crime against XYZ decks. This card is incredibly easy to summon, and has an amazing effect that is not limited to once per turn. Its board wipe invalidates a lot of decks, as it does not target or destroy. This is one of, if not, the best XYZ monsters currently in the format.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Time Thief Redoer: Redoer is a staple rank 4 XYZ monster that has the amazing effect of stealing an opponent’s card from the top of the deck. This card is well known for being hard to maneuver around, as it can simply banish itself to avoid any and all dangers that come its way. Not to mention its bonus effect once it steals your opponent’s cards are incredible, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Traptrix Allomerus: While this card is quite useful, and interacts with your opponent’s monsters well, it isn’t as versatile as the other Traptrix extra deck monsters. But, it does have quite a bit of use, as it special summons a Traptrix at the cost of 2 materials.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 41 Bagooska The Terribly Tired Tapir: Bagooska is a great generic rank 4, especially when you need to stall during a game. Its effect while in defense position can invalidate a large number of decks that rely on monster effects, and its ability to protect itself while in attack position is also very notable.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Tornado Dragon: What’s up with wyrm monsters having “dragon” in their name, despite not being dragon types? Anyways, this card is a staple for most decks that rely on rank 4 monsters, as it has spell speed 2 s/t destruction at a very low cost of detaching a material.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 101 Silent Honor ARK: Yet another staple rank 4! This card, only needing generic materials, is really easy to get on board, and immediately makes its presence known with its terrifying ability to steal an opponent’s monster as material. This card also has a protection effect, letting you use your opponent’s monster to save itself from destruction.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Rafflesia: An incredibly powerful monster, this card not only provides protection for all of your Traptrix monsters, but allows you to search a Hole trap card, and activate it by merely sending it to the GY. This card is the main XYZ monster you want to go for on turn 1, and summoning this card ensures a strong board presence.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Outer Entity Nyarla: Nyarla may seem like a bit of an odd choice for this deck in particular- but let me assure you there is a reason it’s here (that definitely isn’t because this is my favorite card). Its effect on summon includes a cost that discards, allowing for easy GY set-up. Its effect to attach a monster to itself as material, and steal its type/attribute can be very helpful to this deck, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toadally Awesome: Toadally Awesome is an incredible negate card, and is one that you absolutely need in any deck that includes Paleozoic trap cards. While its effect in the Standby Phase isn’t used for this deck, its negation certainly is. As well, it also allows you to set the negated card to your field, which can lead to cheesy steals of cards, whether they be staple spells and traps or important monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Opabinia: I opted to run 2 Opabinia over 1 Opabinia and 1 Anomalocaris, due to the latter having a difficult summoning condition to fulfill (any XYZ that requires 3 or more materials is automatically bad, unless it has an amazing effect to back it up). And, Opabinia’s effect of letting you activate Paleozoic traps from the hand is extremely valuable, as is its search effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Traptrix Sera: This is one of the best link-1 monsters in the game, inspiring an entire engine due to its powerful abilities. This card is very likely one of the best in this deck, and increases its consistency tenfold. Its effect to special summon from the deck triggers many effects, notably Traptrix Myrmeleo, which lets you pop a s/t for free. This card can also set up lots of XYZ plays with its effect. And, when the effect of another Traptrix is activated, you can set a Hole trap card from your deck, as well.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Traptrix Allomerus: This is in case you wanted another copy of this card, as it does have some decent use in this deck. I recommend swapping it out for a generic rank 4 such as Time Thief Redoer, or Bagooska.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Abyss Dweller: A generic rank 4 that can easily be swapped out for one of the other rank 4s.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Gagaga Cowboy: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: This card allows you to easily remove problem cards without destroying them, and is generally very easy to summon, requiring generic materials. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Phoenix: Good staple link that’s easy to summon, and offers a good s/t removal effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Break Off Trap Hole: This is one of the better Hole trap cards in this deck, but is kind of slow if your opponent does not run a deck focused on link monsters, and thus, is meant to be sided in.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Ice Dragon’s Prison: A generic trap card that offers incredible removal, or a monster to your board for XYZ/link summons.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Hallucigenia: One of the more decent Paleozoic traps, however, this card does not do as much as the others, and is put in the side deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Marrella: Good for GY set-up.</span>"

The perk to the deck is having so many starters, starters for days. After that you need some Polys - Thunder Dragon Fusion is by far the best of these (we end on Battle Butler + Apollo). Instant Fusion is a +1 in a lot of our combos, and makes the cut for that - I could run Fusion sage, but I want 3 Thunder Fusion so that would be too much poly. Hand traps are hand traps - there's a 1 of Pank and Feather Duster to clear backrow, Droll for Dragon link, Imperm and Veiler for everything else. Not a perfect line-up but it's simple and I like it. Dragoon still exists, and generic effect negation is still strong in most matchups. Pot of Desires is OP in this deck - you literally never care about what you banish. Usually it's advisable to pull the 3 Battle Butler materials out first, but honestly, I like to just blindfire it away early in the turn as Ash bait.

Top tier meta contender in the OCG, soon to be TCG.","Fuck the other Invoked variants, we have small children with disturbing eldlich monstrosities. The children part is meta in the OCG, and i'm betting it's gonna be meta in Amurica once the rule of Dragon Link falls. But here I  made a deck to show off the capabilities of it. AKA a cool fusion/link deck that shits out fusion/link fodder, makes big monsters, and then slowly realizes on turn 40 that it has no other game plan because Battle Butler is hard to make use of (would appreciate suggestions on how to re-use him after tributing him, thankies). Jokes aside, the Prankids spam out resourcse to make big monsters with okay effects, and the Invokeds fuse together to steal opponent's cards as they fuse. The main synergy comes in the varying attributes of the Prankids, unlocking many fusions for you to go into, and the fact that they're both meta fusion archetypes. Anyway, deck list. 3 Rocksies- Key component of the small children, provides draw and fodder 3 Lampies- Fodder and burn, another key component 3 Dropsies- A effect Dzeef would hate, with more fodder 3 Fansies- Graveyard setup and fodder 3 Aleister- Key component of Invoked engine, mainly used to fuse together 3 Ash- can put a chokehold on a lot of decks, as most decks search heavily 2 Ogre- nice monster removal that can get annoying stuff like that weird synchro Borreload away 3 Ghost Belle- underapreciated ghost girl, shut's down a lot of decks 3 Prank Kids Prank- Graveyard set up and more fodder, but also allows you to re-use resources and draw 3 Prank Kids Place- Good searcher with some okay stat changing effects, although they can help to beat over problem monsters like Dragoon or the weird synchro Borreload 3 Prank Kids Pandemonium- The archetypal fusion spell, fantastic card, although it locks you into Prank Kids so i reccomend getting your Invokeds out first 3 Invocation- oh, you think that's your Ash? you mind if I just, make a Purgatrio with it? 1 Instant Fusion- gets out Raidjin and some of the Prankids fusions to start off or extend combos 3 Desires- Great draw spell, although cost is heavy, lookin at you Johnny 2 Prank Kids Plan- some battle protection and link summoning, not very good i probably should've cut it lol Extra Deck Bullshit 2 Battle Butler- 3k beater with a raigeki and resource recovery and a badass name. Just unsure how to make more use of it since he has to tribute himself to use this effect. I really wanna make a loop of him tbh since he's not a once per turn 2 Rocket Ride- Insta target, gets out more resources you already spent and gets out a little damage sometimes 2 Weather Washer- Other insta target with an okay-ish effect, only really good as a secondary option to Rocket imo 1 Elysium- great target to build up into, can destroy boards 1 Magellanica- 3k beater, wish Aleister would've become a cat girl instead of this but eh 1 Mechaba- GY setup and negates 1 Augodies- Dunno how to spell it's name but, can remove monsters and grow to be a big beater 1 Purgatrio- beefy beater against swarm decks, great target to use with your opponent's Ash Blossom 1 Roarin Rooster- Feather Duster on legs, and monster recovery. Link version of Butler basically 1 Bow Wow Bark- Monster recovery yet again 1 Dodo-Doodle-Doo- Spell recovery which is really nice in a fusion archetype, and general resource recovery. Playing guide This deck isn't super complex or anything. You want to link climb with the Prankids to get to the link-4, and use the Prankids effect to garner more resources as they're linked away. Use the resources gathered by the linked Prankids to fuse into a Battle Butler, and then use your opponent's cards (and probably hand traps lol) against them as you go into a Invoked monster, hopefully Mechaba for negates or Purgatrio against swarm decks. Afterwards, rip and tear your opponent (hopefully by the effect of Place) until you eventually get them in OTK range and win. (Things to note! Going second is best, and you should definetly run TTT  in case your opponent hand traps any of your Prankid's resource garnering effects. My dumbass forgot to run it. If you decide to play this deck, run TTT instead of Plan.)"

LET'S GOOOOOO! Jokes aside, this came from a joke from my friendo Toon and here it is. Invoked Impcantation Hungry Burger. I regret this massively but here it is. Deck guide. 3x Crealtar- Big 3k boy who can get out Imps to sacrifice for our Burger, and can OTK wit our boy Hungry Burger. 3x Chalislime- Monster removal and swarming the field 3x Hungry Burger- TOP TIER CARD! DESTROYS DRAGOON AND BUSTER LOCK! OUTS DRAGON LINK!!!!!! 3x Aleister- part of the invoked engine, serves to make some fusions for us as well literally all the non ritual Impcantations- i'm not gonna go through all them, they do the same thing. They fetch more Imps from the deck to provide mass fodder to get out your Hungry Burger and finally get some meaning in your worthless wife. 3x Ash- Cripples a lot of meta decks that this is gonna be playing against, as they're all very search heavy 3x Invocation- Other part of the Invoked engine, steal your opponent's monsters to fuse 3x Hamburger Recipe- OH, YOU GOT APPOLUSA???? HUNGRY BURGER MOTHER FUCKER 3x Inception- Serves to get out Chalislime and Crealtar with the leftovers that you didn't tribute for Hungryburger. 1x Instant Fusion- gets out an easy card like Raidjin or Caliga to screw over the opponent, and fodder to tribute for Hungry 3x TTT- The mass amount of SS from the deck due to the Imps can be negated heavily by ash, so TTT helps us gain advantage off of that The extra deck~ 2 Elysium- great target to build up into, can destroy boards 2  Magellanica- 3k beater, wish Aleister would've become a cat girl instead of this but eh 2  Mechaba- GY setup and negates 2 Augodies- Dunno how to spell it's name but, can remove monsters and grow to be a big beater 2 Purgatrio- beefy beater against swarm decks, great target to use with your opponent's Ash Blossom 2 Raidjin- Book of moon on legs, screws over problem cards 2 Cocytus- Big wall l0l 1 Caliga- big floodgate that can easily stop the opponent since Hungry is a vanilla monster playing guide Why do I do these things? Basically, you'll want to start by normal summoning Aleister, and getting the search, and fusing into whatever you need. Due to the Imp's restriction's, you need to do this first before you do your other plays. Once you're done with your Invoked bullshit, you  spam the Imp's hand effects to swarm the field heavily with a ton of the imps. Then tribute into our boy Hungry. Afterwards, use the leftovers (if you can) for Chalislime and/or Crealtar. Then OTK like a chad. Any suggestions are appreciated. This deck is gonna top the next YCS. Just watch it."

Doki Doki can be played at any number for magnet decks, but if you plan to use the normal monsters in your deck, 2-3 of these really help get them out of your hand and into your grave, <strong>where they belong.</strong> the card also synergizes great with Sentry Soldier of Stone (played at 2), as one Doki Doki can discard it and instantly you have 3 monsters on the field for link summons and xyzs, possibly more if Doki Doki summoned Gamma while you have another Magnet Warrior in the hand, <em>or</em> Delta while Magnetic Field is out.  finally onto Delta, its main effect (hard once per turn) dumps a level 4 or lower Magnet Warrior from your deck straight to your grave, which is where the fun begins. Electromagnet Warriors thrive off of being in the grave, as they can be summoned back with Magnetic Field to do their magic, or more importantly be sent their as material to summon Berserkion <em>or</em> give an already summoned Berserkion more material to ruin your opponent's field with.  the normal monster Magnet Warriors are completely optional, as they can be cumbersome in the hand and can lead to inconsistency, but they're suprisingly versatile when combined with other cards. discard fodder for Doki Doki, can be summoned with Gamma if your hand's lacking Electromagnets or for a quick Knightmare link summon, optimal targets for Delta's destruction effect to prevent banishing Electromagnets needed to summon Berserkion, you name it. i haven't had too much consistency problems myself with 6 of these, but be wary of using more than that.  Magnetic Field adds tons of utility to your plays. being able to summon Electromagnets back from the grave really broadens your options, and also has a neat effect where if <em>any</em> monster in this deck (aside from handtraps but you get what i mean) battles or is battled, and the opponent's monster is still on the field, it goes straight back to the hand, or the extra deck if it came from there.  as for handtraps, i reiterate that i got my roots in yugioh from duel links, so i have <em>no idea</em> what's the best ones to run, same goes for tech cards like Called By The Grave or Infinite Impermanence or whatever. i just kinda put whatever seemed like good cards into this and ran with it. <em>This and Extra Deck cards need suggestions.</em>  now, i know what you've been thinking, <strong>""what are you doing playing enemy controller this isn't duel links you foolish child""</strong>, and my answer to that is Econ's take ability is underrated, can do some absolutely wack things, especially in the middle of your opponent's turn. it's also nice to have another layer of protection against attacks. it's <em>totally</em> not just in because i have no idea what other tech cards to put in, <em>totally.</em>  and now, we get to Polymerization and the massive lad that is <em>Imperion Magnum the Superconductive Battlebot.</em> using 2 of Valkyrion and Berserkion in the deck means that you'd have to have a miracle to summon a third Imperion in one duel, so while Magnum is played at 2, Polymerization could be played at 2 or 3, dependeing on how dependent you want to be on using Imperion over Berserkion. Magnum here can be considered the <em>magnum</em> opus of the Magnet Warrior archetype, with a stupidly huge 4000 atk and def, an omni (i think) negate once per turn, and a float effect similar to Berserkion's. it can be very hard for your opponent to handle an Imperion, especially since you can still fill up your field for link summons and xyzs, but make sure not to waste your omni negate and leave it open to destruction, and if you have a second Poly in your hand you should avoid summoning Berserkion or Valkyrion so Magnum's float works properly in the case it is destroyed, letting you use Berserkion pops before using Poly again for another Imperion. just make sure your second Magnum doesn't get destroyed too, because once you've used up both Valks and Berserks, the float effect doesn't work  every link monster is new to me, so i have no idea which ones to choose in particular. just went with common link monsters like Knightmares and Borrel Dragons. xyzs are just generic rock support. <em>This and Handtraps/Tech cards need suggestions.</em>  <em>don't even get me started on side decks</em>  &nbsp;  welp, here's the first draft of the Magnet Warrior Bible. hey, at least i can link this in future itterations of my magnet decks for those that have <em>no idea</em> how to play magnets. if you just tl;dr'd my whole explanation, i need help with what handtraps, tech, and extra deck monsters to use, so please give suggestions to me, if you couldn't tell by now i'm desperate <strong>please i have no idea what support cards are good for this</strong>"

This is my 50th deck, and this includes a list of every card used, and why I use them, as well as ","<span>I can't believe it's finally time! Deck number 50! I will surely be making more decks, so don't worry. Anyways, Paleozoic Frogs are my favorite deck in the game. They’re a blast to play, and are a relatively unique deck in the game. It is one that I myself recommend you to play, so I am here to show off my list, along with explanations for cards and what not. Let’s begin! Starting with...</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>The Monsters:</strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Swap Frog: Swap Frog is one of 3 frog monsters used in this deck, and for good reason. It’s an easy card to summon, and when summoned, has the ability to send a frog to your GY, which is likely to be Ronintoadin. If the card was special summoned with its own effect, you can send a Ronintoadin to your GY, in order to summon it, banishing the monster sent to the GY for Swap Frog’s special summon. Then, you can easily go into Toadally Awesome.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Dupe Frog: Dupe Frog is the second of the 3 main deck frogs you’ll see in this deck. While its effect is not the greatest, as it is a “when” effect, and thus has the ability to miss timing if it is used as link material, or something of the sort. However, of all the other frogs (that are not Swap Frog and Ronintoadin), it is the best. (Also its art is adorable, look at him, he’s graduating college. Tell him that you are proud in the comments or else.)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Ronintoadin: Last, and certainly not least, we have Ronintoadin, the second best of the 3 main deck frogs! If it is in your GY, you can banish one of your other frogs to special summon it! This effect is NOT limited to once per turn, fortunately, and you can do some amazing plays with this card!</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Imperial Order: Imperial Order is unfortunately limited, and for good reason. Blocking out spells for little cost is ridiculous, as many decks rely on their spell cards to actually function. While this card requires you to pay 700 LP every Standby Phase, that isn’t much of an issue, as you should be finishing games before that turns into an issue.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Solemn Judgment: Solemn Judgement; the most iconic of the solemn trap cards, is also one of the most useful, as it negates any summon, spell, or trap. While the cost of paying half your LP may seem large, it in reality is not, as the card can never kill you, and LP do not matter all that much.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Solemn Strike: Strike has a slight edge over Judgement, as it can negate monster effects, whereas Judgement was unable to. However, that is, truthfully, its only edge. It’s the worst Solemn trap card featured in this deck, but it is still good.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Solemn Warning: Definitely the second best solemn trap card. This has the ability to negate not only summons, but cards/effects that have effects to special summon. This means that this card is capable of negating things like Red-Eyes Fusion for a less steep cost than Judgement. But, considering that this can only negate summons, Judgement slightly beats it in terms of versatility.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence: For any deck that uses trap cards, Infinite Impermanence is a must-have staple card, and that definitely applies here. This card not only functions as a hand trap, but as a generally useful negation card. You WANT to open this card, as it lets you stop your opponent’s plays on turn 1. If your opponent plays a deck reliant on a lot of continuous spells/traps (or spells and traps in general), you can bait them into playing into the Imperm Column.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Canadia: This card functions as a sort of pseudo Book of Moon. This card, being a terror in Duel Links, is also incredible in this deck, as it can function as non-removal removal, ignoring things such as destruction protection, and whatnot. But, there are some more useful Paleozoic traps, believe it or not. So now, we shall move on.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Dinomischus: Dinomisc (not Miscellaneousaurus), is on the higher end of trap cards in general, and is heavily boosted due to the fact it is a Paleozoic trap card. Its effect provides useful removal, being able to rid problem cards from your opponent’s board, or to banish combo pieces away to potentially wreck your opponent’s plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Hallucigenia: This is not the most useful of the Paleozoic traps, but it can be useful in a pinch. However, this card is mainly used for the effect is has in the GY, which is shared by all Paleozoics, and to trigger other Paleozoic cards from the GY, as its effect doesn’t waste any important resources.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Paleozoic Marrella: This card can set up your GY with some other Paleozoic cards, or  can be used for deck-thinning purposes. But, this isn’t the most useful in this deck, as you shouldn’t need to send Paleozoics to the GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Olenoides: Olenoides, or Olen for short, acts as this card’s main way to remove spells and traps, functioning as an MST of sorts. This can easily remove problem cards from your opponent’s field, be it a pesky Mystic Mine, or a dreaded backrow card. This is one of the 3 “better” Paleozoic cards, and is a staple 3 of in any Paleo Frog list.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Trap Trick: Ah, Trap Trick,  you remind me of a specific archetype… but what could it be? Nonetheless, Trap Trick is an incredible card for this deck, allowing you to search things such as Infinite Impermanence, or your Paleozoic cards, and then it allows you to activate it on that turn. The one downside this card has is that you can only activate 1 trap card after it is used, but that isn’t that much of an issue, truthfully.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Warning Point: This card is just… wow. It’s an amazing trap card. Not only does this thing negate effects, it essentially makes the monster useless, especially if it is normal summoned. Not only is this thing searchable by Trap Trick, increasing its versatility tenfold, it’s not limited to once per turn, letting you absolutely destroy your opponent’s plays, better than almost any other card in this deck. What was Konami thinking when they created this powerhouse?</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder: At this point, are you surprised this is in a deck I made? This card is probably one of the best XYZ monster in the format, and instantly increases the consistency of any XYZ based deck. But, in this deck, you won’t be wanting to immediately go into ZEUS. It’s more of a situational card here, that you’ll only want to use sometimes, as the other XYZ monsters are just plain better for what this deck tries to do.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Paleozoic Anomalocaris: I more so run this card to humor the Paleozoic archetype. You don’t want to be using this card all that much, but it is an option. While it may be able to pop a card on the field, it isn’t worth the effort to summon this thing. Especially when one of its “advantages” is having more ATK than its superior counterpart, Opabinia.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 45 Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition: That’s a long name, huh? Number 45 is mainly used for its effect to block effects of cards, and cards with that same name. This can be extremely effective against things like Cyber Dragon, but like the above 2 XYZ monsters, is quite situational in this deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toadally Awesome: Oh boy, here we go! This card is what makes this deck possible. When you get Toadally Awesome on board, you are automatically at an advantage. This thing not only generates advantage, but allows you to negate, and steal your opponent’s cards. So if they use a lot of staple spells and traps, you’ll be sure to steal it with this frightening amphibian(s)! During the Standby Phase, the best target for its effect is Dupe Frog (on your opponent’s turn) and Swap Frog (on your turn). If you can protect the frogs summoned by this, you can summon another Toad for absolutely free, allowing you to set up more rank 2 plays. This card, when sent to the GY, can also recycle itself, so if you tribute it for its own negation effect, you can just put it right back into the Extra Deck! The best cards to use for this are your Paleozoic trap cards, as when they are detached as XYZ material, they do not get banished, due to the ruling that XYZ materials are not considered to be on the field (which comes up a lot more than you think it would). Overall, Toadally Awesome is a totally awesome card, and makes this deck function. Bless you, you beautiful bastards. Edit: Toad has been freed! As it is now unlimited, this deck runs 3 of them! Hooray!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Sky Cavalry Centaurea: This card actually serves as a really good removal card, and isn’t as situational as you think it would be. Its effect does not target, and bypasses destruction. This is the main card you want to use to be able to bring out your ZEUS, as its effect occurs during the Battle Phase when it attacks (or is attacked).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin: This card is primarily used in a similar manner to Number 45, serving as a situational pseudo Infinite Impermanence.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cat Shark: Cat Shark is one of the better rank 2s in this deck, and is primarily used towards the end of the game, as this card creates potential for a large number of OTKs, and lets your Toadally Awesome(s) beat over cards it otherwise could not have defeated by itself, and provides you with large attack stats in order to quickly finish a game.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Opabinia: This is the 2nd best XYZ monster in the deck, only being beaten out by Toadally Awesome. The fact that it not only can search Paleozoic trap cards, but allows you to activate them from the hand (granting them a bit of protection from basic s/t removal, and making your opponent unsure if you have any trap cards to activate). You will always want to go into this card after summoning a Toadally Awesome if you can do so.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: Do I really need to explain why Knightmare Unicorn is so good? It provides non-destruction removal for little to no cost, and backs it up with a pretty decent body. It may be a tad bit tricky to summon at times, but it’s usually worth it for removing problem cards/monsters that would otherwise be hard to get rid of.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Marincess Coral Anemone: Originally this spot was taken up by Number 29 Mannequin Cat, but considering that this card is much less situational, and is more useful in a deck like this, allowing you to recover things such as Paleozoic Opabinia, Mistar Boy, and your frog monsters for free. This card is a staple in any deck revolving around WATER monsters, and it’s truly criminal that it hasn’t seen that much play.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Mistar Boy: One of the better cards in the deck, this will very likely be a part of your endboard, as this not only provides your WATER monsters increased power, but has a floating effect to recover your monsters in the GY if it is destroyed. This card provides incredible amounts of utility for this deck, and is a must have for Paleo Frogs.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Gravedigger's Trap Hole: A generic trap card for opponents whose decks are very handtrap heavy. Not only does it negate, but it does a massive chunk of burn damage, which is actually very useful (considering the amount it does).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Ice Dragon's Prison: It’s a staple trap card, and provides great removal, or even material for your XYZ/link monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Paleozoic Hallucigenia: Another copy in case you wanted to side in more.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Paleozoic Marrella: Same as above.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Paleozoic Pikaia: Couldn’t really find much use for Pikaia in the main deck, as its effects don’t give as much utility as something like Olenoides or Dinomisc. But, it is still a good Paleozoic card, and deserves to be put in the Side Deck for that reason alone. (Also Pikaia just sounds like a weird Pokemon ngl)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x White Howling: Really good spell negation, however Imperial Order is better. But, if you do want to have more negates on spell cards, this is the way to go. I myself have used it in many matches, and it has won me a lot of games.</span>  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <span>Oh boy! We’re finally done with all of the card explanations! Now onto more explaining… how fun. Starting with:</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Potential Questions:</span><span> </span><span> </span></span>  <span><span>Q. Why do you not run Treeborn Frog?</span></span>  <span>A. It doesn’t do well with this deck, as it requires you to have no spells or traps on field to activate it, which is the opposite of what this deck tries to have on board. Also, its level doesn’t synergize well with any of the other cards.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Q. Why do you run Paleozoic Anomalocaris if you claim it to be bad?</span>  <span>A. While Anomalocaris isn’t the greatest, it does serve a niche in this deck that is nice to be filled.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Q. Why do you not run Barrier Statue Of The Torrent?</span>  <span>A. It would take up space used for things such as Warning Point, or the Solemn trap cards, and isn’t really necessary for this variant of Paleozoic Frogs.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><span>Q. Why do you say ZEUS is situational?</span><span> </span></span>  <span><span><span>A. This deck wants a strong board presence, as that is how most of its negates are able to exist. ZEUS wipes the board.</span> </span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Q. Frog?</span>  <span>A. Frog.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Strategies: </span></strong><span> </span><span>This list (and Paleozoic Frogs in general) is a control deck, and is centered around disrupting, and ruining, your opponent’s plays through the work of trap cards, and Toadally Awesome. Examples of potential plays/combos:</span></span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li><span>Special summon Swap Frog from hand, by sending a Dupe Frog to the GY, then use its summon effect to send Ronintoadin from your deck to the GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Normal summon Swap Frog from hand, and use its summon effect to send Dupe Frog to GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Link summon Marincess Coral Anemone using the 2 Swap Frogs.</span></li>  	<li><span>Use the effect of Marincess Coral Anemone to special summon a Swap Frog from your GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Use the effect of Swap Frog on summon to send Ronintoadin to the GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Special summon Ronintoadin by banishing a Dupe Frog.</span></li>  	<li><span>Link summon Mistar Boy by using Swap Frog and Ronintoadin as materials.</span></li>  	<li><span>Special summon 2 Ronintoadin from your GY by banishing 2 of your frogs.</span></li>  	<li><span>XYZ summon Toadally Awesome</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>Another combo (this one is more simple, and you are much likelier to get this than the last):</span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li><span>Special summon Swap Frog by sending either Dupe Frog or Ronintoadin to the GY, then use its summon effect to send the other of the 2 frogs from deck to GY.</span></li>  	<li><span>Special summon Ronintoadin.</span></li>  	<li><span>XYZ summon Toadally Awesome.</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span><span>Anyways, onto a guide of how to play this!</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck, as stated before, is a control deck, so you want to disrupt your opponent the best you can using your trap cards. Things such as Paleozoic Canadia, Warning Point, Solemn Warning, and Paleozoic Dinomischus are great reactions to your opponent’s normal summon, and many work on special summons. The best reaction to a special summon (primarily to a big combo piece, such as Romulus for Dragon Link) is Infinite Impermanence, however Solemn Warning can do what Imperm tries to do as well. Then, you’ll be wanting to use your Paleozoic trap cards from the GY to special summon themselves as monsters, in order to go into XYZ plays (primarily for Toadally Awesome). If you get Swap Frog, but no other monsters, normal summon it, use the effect to mill Ronintoadin, and use the other effect to return it to hand. (The return to hand is cost, so it can’t be negated).</span>"

It goes second. You don't have to rely on<strong> Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</strong> to start your plays since you can just go through the regular <strong>Crusadia</strong> link climb without it. However, starting off with <strong>Slumber</strong> and<strong> Kyoutou Waterfront</strong> allow you to get your plays off more frequently and using less resources.  Your general maindeck <strong>Crusadia</strong> package is playsets of <strong>Arboria</strong>, <strong>Draco</strong>, and <strong>Maximus</strong>.<strong> Crusadias</strong> summon themselves to a link zone so you want to have as many of them with different names in your hand. <strong>Arboria</strong> is <strong>Balelynx</strong>, <strong>Draco</strong> recycles<strong> Crusadias</strong> to hand, and <strong>Maximus</strong> doubles your <strong>Equimax's</strong> damage. <strong>Leonis</strong> can be played, but he doesn't bring that much to the table as he only gives piercing damage. <strong>Reclusia</strong> can definitely be sided for some removal, but you rather use it for link climbing instead and it doesn't contribute to making your plays that much either.  Your <strong>Kaiju</strong> package consists of 3 <strong>Radian</strong> and 3 <strong>Gameciel</strong>. <strong>Radian</strong> can be used as generic removal since he is a <strong>Kaiju</strong> or he can be used as a target for <strong>Slumber</strong>. If you control him, he can be used to boost your<strong> Crusadias'</strong> ATK. <strong>Gameciel</strong> is also removal, but he is probably the best card in the deck no joke. If you have <strong>Waterfront</strong> on the field, your link climbing generates enough <strong>Kaiju Counters</strong> to have <strong>Gameciel</strong> be at least 3 or even 4 negates in response to your opponent's board, handtraps, and their backrow. If you summon using <strong>Slumber</strong> on an automatic simulator, often times, the first kaiju you pick is summoned to your field, so you have to pick <strong>Gameciel</strong> first. You can play other <strong>Kaijus</strong> like <strong>Thunder King</strong> or <strong>Dogoran</strong> instead of <strong>Radian</strong>, but <strong>Radian</strong> has the potential to just have you gain more advantage when it comes to using your <strong>Crusadias'</strong> ATK gaining effects.  Other cards in the maindeck include <strong>World Legacy - ""World Crown""</strong> and a <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> package. <strong>World Crown</strong> is a pseudo-<strong>Crusadia</strong> as it does summon itself to a link zone. It acts as a negate for Extra Deck monsters which is another layer of protection during your link climbing. You have a lot of spells in this deck, so you can use <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> to draw into more <strong>Crusadias</strong> or into extending enablers. If there is ever a Spellcaster<strong> Kaiju</strong>, you can say goodbye to <strong>Apprentice Illusion</strong> in the deck.  Your field spells consist of <strong>Kyoutou Waterfront</strong> and <strong>Crusadia Revival</strong>. <strong>Waterfront</strong> is your enabler of your <strong>Kaiju</strong> plays and <strong>Revival</strong> makes one of your<strong> Kaiju</strong> links into a <strong>UCT</strong>. <strong>Terraforming</strong> is here to search for the previously mentioned <strong>Kyoutou Waterfront</strong> and <strong>Crusadia Revival</strong>. <strong>Slumber</strong> is monster removal and gets you to your<strong> Kaijus</strong>.<strong> Crusadia Testament</strong> is a target for <strong>Leonix</strong> if you have access to <strong>Revival</strong> already. You want <strong>Revival</strong> more than <strong>Testament</strong> in most situations. <strong>World Legacy Succession</strong> is just for extending. <strong>Pot of Desires</strong> and <strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong> are your draw engine to get into extenders.  Your Extra Deck is all link monsters since you aren't summoning anything else. <strong>Knightmare</strong> package of course. <strong>Crusadia</strong> Link package: 3 <strong>Magius</strong>, 1 <strong>Spatha</strong>, 3 <strong>Leonix</strong>, and 3 <strong>Equimax</strong>. <strong>Magius</strong> and <strong>Leonix</strong> search extenders while <strong>Equimax</strong> is your monster you are relying on to OTK. <strong>Spatha</strong> is very conditional. It moves a monster to a different zone. It isn't that relevant in <strong>Kaiju Crusadia</strong> as it is in <strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia</strong>. <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong> can be taken out, but it is sort of a last ditch effort to wall-up if you make it using a <strong>Kaiju</strong> or some other lvl 7 or higher monster. <strong>Borrelsword</strong> you can make if you can't finish your opponent turn 2 and it goes back to you on turn 4. <strong>Avramax</strong> is another option for you to go into to wall-up.  Side deck is to tech against certain decks going second. <strong>Nibiru</strong> to prevent large negate boards. <strong>Phantazmay</strong> to gain advantage against link decks. <strong>Token Collector</strong> is a body for link material and it prevents your opponent doing <strong>Linkross</strong>/<strong>Auroradon</strong> plays and you don't get <strong>Nibirued</strong>. <strong>Called By the Grave</strong> as another option to protect your plays from getting handtrapped. <strong>Harpies' Feather Duster</strong> to out backrow. <strong>Impermanences</strong> to disrupt your opponent and <strong>Red Reboot</strong> to prevent getting hit by a trap.  Things that you can choose to put in this deck are things that can just summon themselves from hand or grave. <strong>Pankratops</strong> is definitely a good card to put into the deck. <strong>Gamma</strong> is also an option, but it is very clunky in the deck."

Iyvanne summons a token when equipped with noble arms, then use the token and medraut to go into isolde.  On her summon add brothers to your hand or custennin depending on what you have currently.  With isolde's second effect, yeet another 4 noble arms to the GY and summon borz.  Then use iyvanne and borz to go into rank 4 artorigus.  From there use his summon effect to equip 3 noble arms, depending on the situation and the opponent's deck.  if you can use glory to equip a fourth noble arms and set the until the noble arms are needed once again, it is recomended that you do.  &nbsp;  The cards in the deck vary from combo pieces to removal options and adds.  &nbsp;  This is my favourite archetype and one of my favourite decks.

This deck might not be the best evilswarm but its something i hope this deck will make people stop looking down on them. evil swarms are ment to be in other archtypes but this one might change that a little.

After watching a championship video, I saw that a lot of the cards they used wouldn't be able to stand up against a single Lunalight Leo Dancer, except Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. So, I decided to make a deck that could consistently get out Leo Dancer and some other cards while still being able to push through some negates. This dack is not as good as I originally thought, though it is getting better. Right now this deck is on Update 1. Anyway, now the deck:</span>  <span>This deck is supposed to, as I already said, get out Lunalight Leo Dancer. It can do this in a ton of different ways, and does not require a specific huge combo like the World Lock Isolde Combo deck I saw. So, I will just explain the purpose of the cards in the deck:</span>  <span><span>Main Deck</span></span>  <span><span>Lunalight Monsters:</span></span>  <span>3x Lunalight Wolf: Wolf is a great monster used to fusion summon using your graveyard. Is very useful when combined with Lunalight Kaleido Chick.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Crimson Fox: Crimson Fox is useful to change your opponent's monsters to 0 ATK and negate an effect that targets your Lunalight cards to mess up your plays.</span>  <span>1x Lunalight Blue Cat: Blue Cat is nice for increasing your monster's attack, although I only have 1 because it is not extremely useful.</span>  <span>3x Lunalight Kaleido Chick: Kaleido Chick is basically the heart of the Lunalight archetype. It is useful in </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> many ways! One: It allows you to skip steps in your fusion summoning. By sending Panther Dancer to the GY, you are able to use Kaleido Chick itself as Panther Dancer or use Wolf to banish Panther Dancer to get Leo Dancer. Or, if you can you could do both! Also, the effect of sending the card to the GY is the requirement, so Infinite Impertinence is basically useless against it if you have a Wolf. Two: It allows you to recycle your Polymerization. Three: When it is banished, say by Wolf or Allure of Darkness, it prevents your opponent from activating effects during the battle phase of annoying cards like Quaking Mirror Force or D.D. Warrior.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Emerald Bird: Emerald Bird is useful on the Normal or Special Summon to discard a card like Lunalight Yellow Martin or Lunalight Serenade Dance, and then pick up a new card to replace it. It is also nice when sent to the Graveyard, as you can recycle Kaleido Chicks and Yellow Martins.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Yellow Martin: Yellow Martin is great for searching out Lunalight Fusion, or, if you can discard it, Lunalight Serenade Dance. Yellow Martin is also useful to return Emerald Birds or Kaleido Chicks back to your hand to use next turn, or just give you and extra material to fusion summon with.</span>  <span>1x Lunalight Purple Butterfly: Purple Butterfly is kind of like Blue Cat, but it can banish itself from your GY to special summon a Lunalight monster from your hand. It can be useful in certain situations, but again, like Blue Cat, is not useful enough to have more than one copy.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight White Rabbit: White Rabbit is good for getting Rid of your opponent's back row of spell/trap cards, although it only returns them to the hand. It can also be useful to get back Lunalight monsters from your GY.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Black Sheep: Finally, the last Lunalight monster! Black Sheep is useful for searching out a polymerization or recycling Lunalight cards. Although that is pretty much it to Black Sheep, it is a useful enough effect to have two of it.</span>  <span><span>Lunalight Spell/Traps:</span></span>  <span>Luna Light Perfume is technically not a ""Lunalight"" spell card, so it will be in the ""Other Spells"" section.</span>  <span>3x Lunalight Fusion: The Fusion Summoner of the Lunalights. Lunalight Fusion is a nice card that allows you to, if your opponent controls a monster from the Extra Deck, use a monster from your Deck or Extra Deck as material, so you can pull out a Leo Dancer using a Panther Dancer from your Extra Deck. There really isn't much more to say about it.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Serenade Dance: Used mostly for its Special Summon ability in your GY, Serenade Dance can easily pull out a Kaleido Chick or, if you want, an Emerald Bird. It can also be useful when you summon a fusion monster, but that is not its main purpose in this deck.</span>  <span><span>Other Monsters:</span></span>  <span>1x Shaddoll Beast: Shaddoll Beast is good for drawing a card, and summoning El Shaddoll Winda &amp; El Shaddoll Construct.</span>  <span>1x Shaddoll Hedgehog: Another Shaddoll monster for Winda &amp; Construct, Hedgehog can also potentially be used to search out a Shaddoll Fusion or another Shaddoll monster.</span>  <span>1x Shaddoll Falco: Yet another material for Winda &amp; Construct, this birdy can also provide some extra protection in tight situations.</span>  <span>2x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: Obviously, Ash Blossom is used to negate what your opponent does on their turn.</span>  <span><span>Other Spells:</span></span>  <span>2x Luna Light Perfume: Perfume is a nice card to search out Lunalight Wolf or another Lunalight monster you really need at the time. It can also come in handy to revive some of your previously used Lunalights. Sadly, Luna Light Perfume is not technically a Lunalight card, so it cannot be searched with Yellow Martin.</span>  <span>2x Allure of Darkness: Allure of Darkness s useful for draw power, and can be used to banish Kaleido Chick to use its banished ability.</span>  <span>1x Polymerization: The classic fusion spell that can be searched with Black Sheep.</span>  <span>1x Foolish Burial: Foolish Burial can be used to mill Yellow Martin to get Lunalight Fusion, or to mill Shaddoll Beast for a draw, or to mill any other monster you want.</span>  <span>2x Foolish Burial Goods: Is useful to mill Serenade Dance for a Special Summon or Perfume for a search.</span>  <span>3x Shaddoll Fusion: Shaddoll Fusion is used to summon El Shaddoll Winda &amp; El Shaddoll Construct, preferably using monsters from the deck.</span>  <span>1x Fire Formation - Tenki: Is useful to search out a Lunalight monster, except wolf, with a nice side effect of giving all your Beast-Warrior monsters 100 ATK.</span>  <span><span>Extra Deck</span></span>  <span><span>Lunalight Monsters:</span></span>  <span>2x Lunalight Leo Dancer: The Boss monster. A truly amazing card that battles you to victory with 3500 ATK and the ability to attack twice and destroy all monsters your opponent controls.</span>  <span>2x Lunalight Panther Dancer: Lunalight Panther Dancer is a pretty good Fusion monster, with a solid 2800 ATK and the ability to attack a lot and gain more ATK. The main reason it is in, though, is that it is necessary to get Leo Dancer, as it is one of the materials. I dropped down to two Panther Dancers in this update, and I think I should have done it a while ago. Panther Dancer is not necessary at three, as it really doesn't hurt consistency.</span>  1x Lunalight Cat Dancer: Cat Dancer is the bottom of the Lunalight fusion chain, however it is not extremely bad, and I have 1 of it because it helps to get out Panther Dancer. Cat Dancer can also be a decent stall card for tight situations, as it is unable to be destroyed by battle and is really easy to summon.  1x Lunalight Saber Dancer: Saber Dancer is not part of the Lunalight fusion chain, but is a great card in its own right. If you need a big hitter with 4000+ ATK, Saber Dancer is the card to choose, because it gains massive amounts of ATK and even has the protection of not being able to be targeted by card effects. Also, Saber Dancer can be good to send to the GY with Kaleido Chick to use its epic GY effect to boost ANY fusion monster you control by 3000 ATK until the end of the turn. However, take notice that it cannot be used the same turn it is sent to the GY.  <span><span>Other Monsters:</span></span>  1x El Shaddoll Winda: Winda is a truly amazing card. It both decimates your opponent by making them only able to Special Summon once and cannot be destroyed by card effects, so it is not extremely easy to get rid of. Winda being so powerful and easy to summon is the only real reason that I have a Shaddoll boost and 3x Shaddoll Fusion to get Winda out as often as possible.  1x El Shaddoll Construct (Suggested by SoonToBe, new in this update): Construct is also a pretty good Shaddoll fusion monster. It allows you to mill a Shaddoll on summon, which is nice. Plus, it can take down monsters bigger than itself with its attack effect. One minor problem is that you have to use Wolf to summon it, but if you use it from the deck with Shaddoll Fusion it doesn't usually matter.  1x Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King: Definitely the longest name on the list, although not the worst effect. Tiger King allows you to immediately set Tenki, which then allows you to search out a level 4 or lower Beast-Warrior. Tiger King also lets you negate all monster effects on the field except Beast-Warriors, so your opponent has no monster effects but your Lunalights are safe and effectful.  1x  Diamond Dire Wolf (Suggested by amorphage, new in this update): Dire Wolf is a pretty good card for this deck, being a Beast-Warrior deck. It allows you to destroy your opponent's cards and your own. This also can trigger some of the Lunalight's ""sent to the GY by card effect"" effects, which is a plus. I usually prefer Tiger King, but Dire Wolf can get rid 0f some Spell/Trap nuisances like Mistake.  1x Raider's Knight (new in this update): Raider's Knight is only used to get Arc Rebellion, and is pretty nice in this deck because all the monsters are DARK.  1x Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon (new in this update): Arc Rebellion is basically the master of OTKs. His effect is completely ridiculous, gaining the ATK of all other monsters. And, not to stop there, since he was summoned off Raider's Knight, it negates all other monster's effects! Also, if you don't want to negate the effects, you can just detach Raider's Knight. The only downside is that other monsters cannot attack, but usually all that attack can still get an OTK of one attack.  1x Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom: Scratch Tiger King having the longest name, Ferrijit's is longer. I have Ferijit in the deck because it allows you to Special Summon a Beast-Warrior from your hand, and then get the higher link Tri-Brigade or just use the effects of the monster summoned.  1x Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen: Wow. I think this is the winner for the longest name. And the highest link. I have Shuraig because it is nice for un-targeting banishment of your opponent's cards.  It is also nice if your opponent manages to get rid of it, you can search out pretty much any of your Lunalights as long as you banished things with Wolf.  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda: Anaconda is a great card in any fusion deck, as it lets you copy any fusion spell from your deck. This lets you copy both Lunalight Fusion and Shaddoll Fusion, whichever you need.  <span><span>Side Deck</span></span>  My Side Deck is mostly full of hand traps, so you can tune your hand traps to what your opponent's deck does the most.  <span>Monsters:</span>  2x Nibiru, the Primal Being: Great against decks that Special Summon a lot, especially monster with low ATK.  2x Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju: The classic Kaiju that gets rid of a monster your opponent controls.  1x Alpha, the Master of Beasts (new in this update): The replacement for Pankratops, Alpha is a great card for going second, as it gives you an automatic 3000 ATK monster to get rid of negating monsters like Apollousa. Then you can return it and any other Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged-Beast monsters to your hand to return more monsters your opponent controls to their hand. And, after that, you can Special Summon it right back if your opponent still has a monster.  2x Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit: Nice for getting rid of monsters like Halqifibrax or Isolde after they use their effects, although it does not negate the effect.  2x Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion: Great against decks that use their GY a lot.  2x Droll &amp; Lock Bird: Great against Decks that search a lot.  <span><span>Spell/Traps:</span></span>  2x Lightning Storm: A great card for starting your tun with to get rid of your opponent's back row of spell/trap cards or monsters.  2x Infinite Impermanence: Great against decks that use monster effects a lot.  &nbsp;  So yeah, that's basically it. Have fun using the deck if you want, look at my other decks please, and comment on how you think I can make this better.  &nbsp;"

Help me.","<span>For starters</span>  <span>Why do I do this? I've created a deck with so many engines and combo pieces that I don't know what the decks main archetype is and what is an engine anymore. I'm afraid. Credit to Toon for both giving me this idea and motivating me to put more effort into this after I saw her frog deck. Anyways, this is an OTK based going-second deck about getting beeg boys and doing beeg damage.</span>  <span>Pros and Cons</span>  <span>Pros: The deck can easily get out some huge monsters and pile up damage, and it doesn't search too often so Ash and cards like it can't affect the deck very much.</span>  <span>Cons: The deck can brick, hard, on occasion, due to various factors; banishing combo pieces like Aleister, Gren and Aleister's normal summons conflicting, etc. </span><span> </span><span>Deck list</span><span> </span><span>3x Thunder King- One of the biggest monsters in the deck, if not the biggest. Thunder King clocks in at 33k, being a very large monster. Although, it’s not much more than that, as we have no way to get Kaiju counters. So Thunder King is just a big body on the field for OTK’s and one of the primary targets for Interrupted, the second being Gamaciel. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Jizikuru- Jizikuru more so serves as a secondary copy of Thunder King. With the same attack value, Jizikuru also is the equivalant of a vanilla on the field. Although, he can still wreak havoc. In the situation where all your Thunder Kings are banished or in the graveyard, you want to use a back-up Jizukuru as a target for Interrupted. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Gamaciel- Gamaciel is another one of the key kaijus for the engine (?). He can easily out problem monsters like Borreload and Appolousa, clearing the way for his buddos to OTK. Gamaciel is the secondary target to Interrupted, the first being Thunder King, since Thunder King can easily run over him.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Kumongous- Kumongous serves as the final Kaiju, and as a secondary copy of Gamaciel. With only 200 more attack, he can still easily out things and be run over by the stronger monsters like Thunder King. Kumongous’ life is pain.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Aleister- a key part of the deck, Aleister enables us to go into many strong Invokeds. Although, he has no way to special summon himself, making him conflict with Gren Maju on occasion, due to both of them wanting to normal summon themselves. (If you are in the situation of having both, I recommend choosing based off of which is more fit to handle the current situation. If you have a Desires in hand, go for Maju. If your opponent has hard to out monsters or if you want/need to turbo into a fusion, go for Aleister.) If Aleister is on the field, my favorite 3 targets for him are Augodies, Purgatrio, and Mechaba. If you’re in the late game and have fusions in the grave to fule Augodies, you can go into her and banish the strongest to make a strong beater.  If you’re playing against a swarm style deck like Dragonlink, you can go into Purgatrio to clear them out. And if you have lots of cards in your hand that you don’t have much of a use for, you can go into Mechaba. The other Invokdes are good as well and have their own situations to use them in.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Gren Maju- Gren Maju serves as one of the decks (possible?) biggest beaters. As long as you have a good amount of cards banished off of Desires and/or Stromberg, you can have a at least 4000 Maju. Maju easily enables OTKs with other strong cards like Thunder King, although he dies to cards like Effect Veiler and Imperm.  Maju also requires a normal summon, and that tends to conflict with Aleister. So when using both of them, be careful and make sure you choose wisely on which one to normal summon. Or do neither and discard both for your Dangers!. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Bigfoot- Bigfoot serves as a big 3k beater on the field, helping to enable and finish OTks alongside cards like Maju and Thunder King. On discard, he gets a pop on any card, similar to Pankratops, which can easily remove problem cards.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Thunderbird- Thunderbird serves as a okay 28k beater, helping to finish off the opponent. On discard, he pops a set card, heavily countering decks like Altergeists; just be wary of Waking the Dragon.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Nessie- The first of the limited Dangers!. Nessie is an okay-ish 28k wall on the field, although it serves nothing to the OTKs. Although, it’s discard effect is much better, and the reason why it’s limited. Nessie can add a Danger to hand on discard, serving to help the (probably struggling)  hand you have. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Mothman- Mothman isn’t very notable on field, just serving to chip away a little at the opponent if in attack position. If discarded, though, he allows both players to draw one and discard one, which can easily help you draw still even though he’s dead (what a reliable guy) and trigger other Danger! Effects. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Chupacabra- Chupacabra is, while on the field, not very notable, similar to Mothman. On discard, though, he can revive a Danger!, serving to revive some of the ones you’ve discarded but want on the field like Bigfoot.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Jackalope- Jackalope is worthless on the field but still very adorable. On discard, though, he special summons a Danger! From deck, which helps generate advantage even when he’s gone. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Tschukinoko- Tschukinoko is also worthless on the field but adorable. And, on discard, he special summons himself from grave, still staying there. What a good guy.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Ash- The deck’s only hand trap. Most, if not all decks nowadays search and special and send a lot. Ash cripples a lot of that, and if used at the correct time, can stop an entire combo. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Interrupted- One of the deck’s key cards, Interrupted dark holes the field (which can basically be a raigeki as long as you’re using it as the first thing you’re doing), and then specials two kaijus from deck to each field. Interrupted is fantastic, destroying the opponent’s board and giving you Thunder King instantly. You can also banish it to search a Kaiju, one of the deck’s rare searches.  For Interrupted, you’ll want to give yourself Thunder King and your opponent Gamaciel. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Invocation- Invocation is another one of the deck’s key cards. Invocation allows you to go into many of the fusions and remove the opponent’s cards at the same time, as long as you have Aleister. Technically, you can use an opponent’s Aleister if you’re playing against an opponent using Invoked’s, so keep that in mind. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Desires-  Desires does a host of things for the deck. Everything it does actually generates advantage, as the banish 10 provides mass fodder to get Gren to 4000. And the draw 2 is basically a nice bonus on top of that. The “cost” is the main effect you want, so I don’t care if the draw is negated; the draw is just a nice bonus.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3x Stromberg- Stromberg also does a host of things for the deck. It banishes 10, providing more fodder for Gren. And, it also has the final effect nobody reads. As long as your opponent is a dumbass, they damage themselves seriously if they try attacking you. And if they do actually bother to read it and realize the final effect, they have to wait until they get a Twin Twisters or something so they can actually attack. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Instant Fusion- The final main deck card. Instant Fusion allows you to easily get out Raidjin and Caliga, two nice monsters to have on the field. The 1000 cost is very light compared to other cards, and Raidjin easily cripples problem cards by flipping them face down, and Caliga is a fantastic, archetypal floodgate.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>The Extra Deck</span><span> </span><span>2x Elysium- Elysium serves to be a big boss monster for the Invokeds late game. As long as you have a fusion and the opponent is playing some extra deck stuff, you can use Invocation to get out Elysium. Elysium, on field, is basically a really big beater with monster removal. It also looks like a biblically accurate angel.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Mechaba- one of the key Invokeds, Mechaba provides great negates as long as you have a large hand, which is possible with things like Desires and the Dangers!. You  can easily negate things and the such, also banishing cards, the only downside being that Mechaba isn’t a very strong attacker. He can still put work in for an OTK though.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Magellanica- Magellanica is basically a big 3k beater that is actually a vanilla, unlike Thunder King. Magell isn’t super good but still fairly useful against earth heavy decks. I wish Aleister would’ve turned into a cat girl instead of this though.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Augodies-  Dunno how to spell it’s name, but it’s a cool card. Augodies serves to grow to high attack stat levels late game, as long as you have a good amount of fusions in the grave. It also has a destruction effect to discourage the opponent from special summoning, which is a very important thing in many decks.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the last key Invoked. Purgatrio heavily punishes swarm decks like Dragonlink, by growing to huge numbers and beating over all of them. He also has really cool art. He’s also easy to get out by using an opponent’s Ash or something like it, due to how heavily used Ash Blossom is.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>1x Cocytus- Cocytus is a 28k wall, similar to Nessie, that can attack in defense postion, which basically enables it to whittle down at the opponent slowly. Not a huge fan of Cocytus but eh, he’s there </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Raidjin- a fantastic instant fusion target, Raidjin can flip a problem card face down to avoid it, and if it has low defense, easily beat over it. Raidjin can also flip itself  face down to avoid Instant Fusion’s negative effects, although he’ll probably just be ran over by the opponent at that point. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>2x Caliga- Caliga serves as a strong floodgate to heavily counter many decks. A lot of our monsters, like Thunder King, rarely activate or just don’t activate their effects, so Caliga doesn’t hurt them very much. Caliga can heavily damage the opponent though.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Playing guide</span><span> </span><span>The deck’s strategy isn’t very complex or anything. Before doing much, you want to activate Interrupted and blow up the field to ss if you have it. If you don’t have it, you want to tribute the opponent’s problem monster with something like a Gamaciel. If you have a Thunder King in hand as you tribute, you can use Thunder King’s in hand eff to SS. Afterwards, you want to either banish some cards for Gren and normal him for a beeg (at least) 4000 beater, if you don’t have Aleister, or normal Aleister and fuse away him and opponent’s cards into whichever Invoked fits the situation.

If you've no normal monsters in your hand, he is a good target for his own discard. <strong>Impcantaion Inception </strong>can create some excessively resource-recycling plays by sending a 'spent' <strong>Impcantation</strong> from your field (or even your hand) to the GY and essentially copying <strong>Challislime's</strong> effect AND returning itself; all in one turn. Finally, as if anything else was required, <strong>Preperation of Rites</strong> is not only a costless, instant and unrestricted searcher of <strong>Challislime</strong>, but it also optionally allows you to retrieve a Ritual Spell from your GY.

Ritual Monsters/Spells</li>  	<li>Up to three <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> to destroy up to 3(!!) of your opponent's cards</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil Warrior Skull Knight </strong>to destroy a monster, but this can be banked unlike,<strong> N'tss</strong></li>  	<li><strong>PSY-Framelord Omega</strong> to recycle a Normal Monster, a non-ritual <strong>Impcantation</strong> or a Ritual Monster/Spell.</li>  	<li><strong>Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</strong> to Draw 1, Shuffle 1.</li> </ul> Finally, mill <em>EIGHT</em> <em>CHOSEN CARDS</em> from your opponent's Extra Deck.

They still feel a little alien to me, but the power of UTC is undeniable. I like combo decks, so this deck is halfway to a combo deck. The idea is to have the option to push over the top, or just to push out a UTC with Dolkka or Laggia or Abyss Dweller or Tornado Dragon, or just push out an emergency UTC. Basically UTC.deck. You can push out 6 interactions on top of UTC with the right hands, or you can play low, depending on what threatens you. Going first btw, but built to have a going second plan.  I've changed my mind on Lost World. The card is worth running going first, particularly in combination with Token Collector as an alternative way to pop dinos. Having your hand trap (a useful one at that) be your best combo piece is pure upside - the downside is in a lot of matchups the card really isn't useful as a hand trap. However, Linkross is everywhere and Auroradon is still broken, so in most matchups the card should at least be live, and it is too good as a combo piece to pass up. The most explosive hands involve seeing the right combinations of 2 dinos, lost world and Token Collector. Obviously, we run 3 Fossil dig, to find those combinations of dinos. Lost World is still good enough going first to run when you're siding for going first against a matchup where you want to take out Token Collector, like Prank-Kids or most Dogmatika builds. Token Collector is also worth running just as a combo piece a lot of the time, and can be insane if timed correctly. For example, if you summon a Dino on your opponent's turn, Lost World will create a token, which in turn lets you pop a baby in the deck with Lost World and Token Collector (out of the GY, after using it once) either searching a follow-up with Oviraptor or getting a free SS2 Pankratops with protection, ETC. Brutal card in this deck.  Numbers are pretty standard for a dino deck. Archosaur is a good enough normal summon to be worth running 3 - in my estimate One For One is a great budget option but is slightly sub-optimal. You want to see Misc and Oviraptor - those are your main starters. 5 babies total helps start and extend combos, and contribute greatly to the deck's grind game. Giant Rex helps make Dolkka and Laggia, and is important in those Token Collector + Oviraptor + Lost World hands. Insane combination that sees you filling the field with a lot of interruptions if you play it right, and gets much better if you see any 1 Dinosaur in your hand.  I feel like Nibiru and Impermanence are pretty good right now, so they're the main deck hand traps. I'm still on one Dogoran, Kaijus seem good right now, and you can search is really easily. Pankratops is kind of a hand trap, but is also a SS2 interruption out of the deck for a lot of hands where you see Petiteranadon.  Gnomaterial seems essential with Zoo in the format performing. Skull Meister splits the difference between D.D. Crow and Artifact Lancea, performing a pale imitation of either in matchups where 1 or the other are good, important with Dinos still performing. Effect Veiler is another good generic hand trap - I want cards that will help me answer True King or Dragoon while adding to my interruptions in matchups where I pull Token Collector for more effective hand traps. (However, as stated above, don't always do this. Token Collector is a stupid combo piece in the deck.) I wanted options that might shut a turn down in the right place, but could also be enough to turn the tide in other matchups I was less prepared for, and this suite seems good for the moment. The rest is a pretty standard suite of backrow removal. I see a lot of people going down to 3 cards, but I still feel more comfortable having a whole 6, just to diversify my options and have good odds of finding that ever essential mine answer. Lightning Storm is run at 3 because it also helps to break boards when going second, but since we're a going first deck I'm not maining them.  The extra deck is just pure gas. You might be able to burn up a lot of your opponent's hand traps early by spamming the field with negates in the right situation (IE when Nibiru isn't showing), and you can go over the top setting up 4 negate Apollos with multiple spell negates and UTCs and maybe even Pankratops or IP into a Knightmare. More commonly you'll be making Apollo/Dollka/Laggia + UTC, or you'll just decide to end on UTC, but being able to stack the field with enough Interruptions to make Dragon Link blush is no mean feat. The other cool thing is Linkuriboh and Secure Gardna, which just give you easy ways to trigger pill after normaling Archosaur, and thus increases the number of UTC plays you can make, since now Archosaur makes UTC with even the lowliest of dinos."

Needs to be cleaned up and thinned down a bit but it's just a fun deck either,"Edit: Made a slight mistake, when I took the level 3 Charmers out Arcanite Magician became unusable. So I spent a little bit of time working with it. It's now 40 cards, still slow but but fun.  Just a fun deck that I threw together so I could play with my favorite set of cards ever. The Charmers are amazing but they're slow, they're sadly not in the deck anymore. It's not perfect but the invoked engine really helps it out. There are three Synchro monsters in there that you can get out pretty easily, well except Xianxian. This deck can even drop Gustav, it used to have Libre but since it's post Battle Phase and Libre has no protection I cut him out. There is another person on here who I pulled inspiration from, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/tactician-musician/"">Tactician Musician.</a>  The Dogmatika and Tuners were from playing some of Tactician's deck. Fairy Tail Luna was just a though and it works okay, maybe need to throw a couple extra ones in or thin the deck a bit as it does sit at 50 cards.  The Extra deck is a variety of Invoked fusions as well as a couple Xyz techs and Link techs to help support the deck. It is by no means a perfect line up and it could be better but I like it.

The Photon Lord combo is super easy, we need 2 lv4 + Astral Force, it means Ascend Sage + lv4 is game. But before that, pay attention to Change Tactics, as you need to ss Ascend Sage first before activating it. Summon Utopia Double, use Utopia Double (Ascend Sage eff) add Astral Force, remember to chainblock with Change Tactics if you have it, use Utopia Double eff add Double or Nothing ss Utopia Beyond, use Astral Force ss Photon Lord.  The combo is Nibiru immune as Photon Lord is our 5th summon. If we used Aleister as our lv4, make sure to have the proper material for Mechaba in hand/GY. On opponent's turn, we can use Photon Lord either to add Photon Thrasher as follow-up or attach it as protection. If we use Trick Clown as xyz material, we gotta manage its eff (dont detach/ss it if we cant extend, cus it turns on opponent's Nibiru). In conclusion, we will have follow-up from Invoked, Thrasher, and Trick Clown, making this Utopia build less glass cannon-ish.  Pros: Great going first or second with big toolbox choice and staples.  Cons: Weak first turn board and to play blind second is super hard against meta (for every Utopia build in general), 45% cant break board, 45% lose on grind, and only 10% OTK."

Best scenario would be to get small Genghis and Lamia on the field, to climb up to small Alexander, and finally Crystal Wing, on the 5th summon at the latest, so we can avoid getting tributed by our opponent's Nibiru. If you can go on, if you used Slime to fusion summon, you might be able to summon something from your hand. If you have Ragnarok in hand, you might be able to bring out Alexander or Genghis from your grave, to then go into Gilgamesh, and bring out any combination of some strong pendulums:  High end:  Newton - Scale 10 is really useful for recycling your pendulum monsters. If you can bounce it off the field, or retrieve it from the extra deck, you can use it to recover useful monsters from your graveyard, probably a slime.  Mid:  Ragnarok - Has a fairly low scale, but there are many extenders you can pendulum with it. A resurrect on a special summon will be really useful but be careful you don't miss out on an OTK just because your damage is halved  Thomas - You'll want D/D cards in your hand more than your extra deck. You can use it to pick up pendulum materials for extra deck monsters, then pendulum them. It's also very useful on the field as a monster, since you can easily go into Kali Yuga while getting rid of one of your pendulum zones.

Digging 6 cards deeper enables a pure Dogmatika deck to see Ecclesia significantly more often, which is important if we're going to play Ecclesia stun. We also run Summoner Monk, as 3 more copies of Ecclesia.  Dogma lineup is 3 Nadir Servant, 3 Ecclesia, 3 Dogmatika Punishment, and 2 Fleurdelis. Servant and Ecclesia are the deck's main starters, and Servant is an insane card, so I wanted to maximize seeing these. Punishment is the deck's best form of interaction, so I wanted to run 3. Fleurdelis is fine, and I think you need to run 2, but I wouldn't run a third, since it is dead without Ecclesia. I didn't want to bother with Maximus, since the card is hard to summon and kind of weak.  I think Dimension Shifter is good right now, it's just a hand trap that covers a lot of bases, and interrupts most decks-quite handily while completely locking out some matchups, and I wanted to maximize running it. Ash is essential with Virtual World as the new deck to beat, and is better in generic matchups than Droll anyways. Effect Veiler is run over Impermanence partially for True King of All Calamities, and partially for Needlefibre shenanigans.  Grand Spiritual Art Ichirin is the field spell for the deck. This card is pretty busted actually, it's searchable by virtue of being a field spell, and it works offensively and defensively - provided you can meet its one requirement. This, however, is met by Ecclesia. We need another field spell for Set Rotation, and Secret Village is a personal favourite of mine in spellcaster decks. Blanket stopping Cosmic Cyclone, Feather Duster, ETC until my opponent removes Ecclesia or summons a spellcaster is very good at face value, and the card interrupts a lot of starters and combos as well. In the same vein are the Right Hand and Left Hand. The deck uses Foolish Burial Goods (or Summoner Monk) to send Magician's Restage to the GY and find the correct hand for the matchup. Left Hand also protects you from Imperm once you have a spellcaster hit the table, which is pretty solid. The last card is Triple Tactics Talent - this deck eats hand traps for breakfast, while setting an obnoxious series of interactions. It still suffers from some inconsistency issues, and it's much weaker without the Pots of Disparity, though Extravagence is (mostly) an admirable substitute in the meantime."

Shell Knight,"OK, so the other day we got quite the spoiler bomb for the Fossil archetype: Shell Knight. We don't have it on the database yet so I'm using Cannonball Spear Shellfish as the substitute in this list.  We're only running 1 copy of this little guy, but boy does his presence affect the look of our deck even at such a low number! I've completely retooled the deck to include Gaia-Plate the Earth Giant as a target for him (as well as being an easy SS if he ends up in hand), as well as adding in Trade-In to further increase our graveyard dump and churn power. This then led to the inclusion of extra Kaijus as Trade-In fodder, and even the addition of Interrupted Kaiju Slumber.  Shell Knight increases the Fossil archetype's OTK power by magnitudes, and the deck was already really good at it! If it wasn't obvious yet, this deck really wants to go 2nd if possible. <p class=""engine-dark-box"">Gameciel is an obvious choice of Kaiju since it's the easiest to run over, but our choice for our 2nd Kaiju being Gadarla has a few reasons behind it: 1) It's an 8-star for Trade-In, and 2) It sports a large attack for when we summon it to our field, while still being small enough to be taken out my Skull King in combat.</p> Keystone is an exceptionally good playmaker in this deck. It has too many uses to name. Making easy link summon turns, recycling our pieces, giving us a free card to pitch to Skull King, the list goes on. This little rock that could is the real deal.  This leaves the rest of the monsters. Revival Golem might look a little funny, but he's extremely useful for setting up link summons off of any of our graveyard dumps (especially Mathematician.) Speaking of, Mathematician is also an insane card here. He sets up all sorts of nonsense and makes our deck run buttery smooth. Rounding out the monster line-up we have our Psy-Frame Gear Gamma. Gamma is our hand trap of choice for both setting up our Fossil Fusion nicely by putting the opponents card in the bin, as well as being good to protect our own plays like Miracle Rupture and Trade-In.  All the spells are fairly self-explanatory, either setting up our graveyard or making big plays for us. Do note that Kaiju Slumber will proc your Fossil Fusion in the graveyard if you have a Fossil in play already; there are some very tricky and cool lines that you can set up to take advantage of this!  Skull King is our #1 summon target since, unlike Skullgios, he doesn't require our opponent to set-up and our own deck is ripe with 8-stars to feed him. He can even sometimes do more damage to your opponent that Skullgios, plus his graveyard-yoink effect card come in clutch against many archetypes. Because of these issues, we only play 1 Skullgios. He is still pretty easy to access, though, especially with so many Dragoons running around these days.  Skull Knight is really just a branch for Time Breach, and the other 2 Fossils in the extra deck are also pretty self-explanatory.  Cross-Sheep is absolutely stellar here. Fossil Fusion is one of the easiest enablers I've ever encountered for this guy, and he bridges so very easily into Accesscode Talker; make sure to also link I:P first for the indestructible! You can also easily make Missus Radiant with him. So many lines offered by this card that there's too many to list; you've just gotta keep an eye out for them.  Missus Radiant ups our OTK potential. Even Mathematician is a respectable beater with her out! Skull King and Skullgios will also bring the hammer down on our opponents LP very quickly using her bonus, the latter of which can deal 8000 damage in one shot to an opponent through a 0 attack or defense monster. Absolutely stunning link monster for the deck.  Rounding out the extra deck we have I:P, who is mainly used for the aforementioned Accesscode lines. However, she also pairs quite well with Knightmare Unicorn in a pinch. Unicorn is just a great universal out to have access to. Finally, Linkuriboh is the GOAT in any deck that can easily summon him (thanks, Nemeses Keystone!)"

I don't bother with meta so there aren't many meta cards you ussualy see in D/D/D decks such as Savage Dragon and Crystal Wing, but you can add them instead of some other monsters.  Use Swirl Slime and Necro Slime to summon D/D/D fusion monsters.  Ghost and Lamia are the main tuners from which one can revive itself and the other one send monsters to GY. Ghost is in my opinion the best way to summon Bright Armageddon.  Necrofear can return banished monsters to GY and easly destroy cards if you have face up spells or traps (good thing this deck uses a lot of pendulums, continues spells and traps).  Gates lets you search needed combo piece, Swamp King is a great fusion spell, Eternal Darkness protects from targeting and tributing (take that Kaiju!) and Witch is a combination of card destruction and ATK buff.  Combine effects of Genghis, Alexander and Ragnarok to revive monsters. D'Arc turns Dark Contract LP price into bonus LP. Siegfried is great for negating any face up spell or trap.  If you get the right set up you can easly summon all 3 Super Doom Kings without any problem"

Not only was Toon Black Luster Soldier a welcome addition to the deck, granting both removal AND the ability to attack directly on the same turn it's summoned (with the ability to be cheated out VERY easily, might I add) but Toon Bookmark and Page-Flip adds some much needed consistency to the deck as well. Toon Harpie Lady is a very nice bonus as well. Backrow removal is always welcome.  Now, I've always been the type of guy who likes to draw his cards pretty darn quickly, hence why you see a 42 card deck with Pot of Desires tossed in. You can tech a surprise Gren Maju De Eiza, or even a Necroface to recycle said cards back into the deck. But, if you aren't chill with that, you can swap the Desires for Extravagance, but be warned that I found the deck a lot more consistent with Desires.  Some of you may be wondering why I'm maining Raigeki/Harpie's Feather Duster instead of shovelling in 2 copies of Lighting Storm. In my experiments, while Lightning Storm is pretty nice on hand to have if you're lagging behind, it's rather limiting seeing as how you can't control anything face-up to use it. Best just to cut to the chase and use the actual cards with no drawbacks. However, I won't object to you swapping in two Lightning Storms.  By the way, just a heads up about Bookmark. If you use Table of Contents, go for Bookmark first. Bookmark can fetch virtually anything Contents can (save for a few cards, but including Comic Hand) and can give you instant GY setup to protect Toon Kingdom when it's out. But if you already do have a Kingdom out, Bookmark can tech Page-Flip or Terror easily. It's your choice depending on if you want to play ""Protect the Castle"" or start stomping on your opponent's guts from the get-go.  If you're using Page-Flip, always, and I mean ALWAYS go for Toon Dark Magician, Red-Eyes or BLS. If you strike gold with BLS, you've succeeded in cheating out your deck's boss monster. If you get Dark Magician, you have access to the Rank 7 engine, by virtue of fishing Red-Eyes as material. Or, you can use him to cheat out BLS. And if you get Red-Eyes, and you have DM or BLS in your hand, well. The game's your oyster at this point.  Number 68 is there because it was the only Rank 8 I had on hand at the time, plus there was a situation where I wished I had one to use.   Instant Fusion is so you can cheese out the Cyber Dragon Infinity engine easy-peasy. I know it ain't the unstoppable Godzilla it used to be, but with this deck, I'm looking to milk whatever advantage I can out of the monsters I put in.  Anyway, I'm a guy who runs Toons unapologetically, and I'm off to play some Pokemon Go. Let me know how this deck runs for you."

It's kinda decent, can be improoved easily with a few non-structure deck cards. Mainly some extra deck monsters.  So, quick explanation. You have Dark Beckoning Beast and Opening of the Spirit Gates, two openers. If you only draw one in the first hand, you want to search the other one with the effect. If you have two and no Dark/Chaos Summoning Beast, search those. The combo would be summoning Dark Beckoning into tribute summon for Dark Summoning, using Opening to discard Chaos and summon it back (Since the cost happens before the effect you can actually do this) and then summon a sacred beast from the deck. Then, with Dark Summoning's gy effect, you search another one if needed and summon it with Chaos, and if you need the field spell he can also search it.  As far as I'm aware the deck runs only one garnet, wich would be Mound of the bountiful creator, wich is mainly for both disrupting your opponent's plays if they run field spells and getting your own field spell. The good thing about this deck is that even if you draw a garnet or an useless card, there are a lot of effects of discard to get something from the gy.  Anyways, the perfect hand would be Opening of the Spirit Gates, Dark Beckoning Beast, Chaos and/or Dark Summoning Beast and then any other card(s). So, what you'd do is use Dark Beckoning to add Awakening of the Sacred Beasts, do the previous described combo to summon two sacred beasts, and if on top of that you have field barrier, cerulean skyfire and/or mistake, you'll be able to put it really hard for your opponent, often instant locking them down.  Another combo you can do, if you want, is normal summon Dark Beckoning, search for Chaos Core, normal summon it thanks to Dark Beckoning, link Dark Beckoning into Salamangreat Almiraj, target Chaos Core, send three sacred beasts to the GY and you can get Armityle just like that.  Good extra deck cards are Salamangreat Almiraj to get rid of Dark Beckoning if you can't other way, Pentestag to deal tons of damage with Raviel and often OTK and not much more.  And a good main deck card to add would be Pot of Acquisitiveness, mainly to unbanish the sacred beasts and/or the beasts."

The strength is that you can use this effect in the opponents battle phase too before the opponent attacks, so if you get a fast summon with <a data-name=""escape from the dark dimension"">escape from the dark dimension</a> or its own effect this can be a good counter. You also don't have to destroy 3 monsters if you throw 3 times 'head', this is the case for <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a>, so <a data-name=""Gatling dragon"">Gatling dragon</a> could destroy itself or your own monsters if you are unlucky, which makes the <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> way better. It has a nice last effect that improves the draw engine a bit, if it gets destroyed or if you discard it with <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> or <a data-name=""One for one"">One for one</a> then you get a <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> from the deck to the hand, which can be used for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> for example.  <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher</a> – It's part of the draw-engine because you can discard it with <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> and you won't lose anything by it because it doesn't matter if you special summon it from the hand or the graveyard. You can also destroy a face-up monster with it's effect by banishing 3 cards from the extra-deck, but only when you didn't already use it's other effect. You can also use it as a discard or target for <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, <a data-name=""BM-4 Blast Spider"">BM-4 Blast Spider</a>, or for a fusion, tribute or synchro-summon, which makes it very effective in a combination with other cards.  <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> – the deck needs a lot of immunity and negates to support the machines and their effects, so <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> fits best as a dark machine. <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a> can also be summoned with <a data-name=""Escape from the dark dimension"">Escape from the dark dimension</a> even when it is a trap, because the trap does not get destroyed by <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a>'s effect and the negation happens after the summon.  <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> – You have to get two times head out of three coin tosses, but it doesn't matter if it does not work, the strengeth is that it can be used as the only barrel dragon on spell and trap cards whcih is most of the time worth it. If you can destroy a card it can possibly also trigger the effect of <a data-name=""Heavy metal raiders"">Heavy metal raiders</a> to summon a dark machine from the hand, this effect can be used before the battle phase so it is easier to plan with it, you can for example use the effect and then tribute it, fusion summon a <a data-name=""Gatling dragon"">Gatling dragon</a>, or xyz summon <a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a>.  <a data-name=""BM-4 Blast Spider"">BM-4 Blast Spider</a> – It can trigger the special summon of <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a> and destroy a monster, this is worth most of the times if the opponent does not has any negations, it can also trigger the special summon effect of <a data-name=""heavy metal raiders"">heavy metal raiders</a>.  <a data-name=""Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a>, <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>, <a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a>, <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> – The token and fast summon engine to support the more slow dark machines with link monsters. <a data-name=""Unknown synchron"">Unknown synchron</a> is a dark machine and always good, with two lvl 4 monsters or tokens you can summon <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a> which can destroy one monster one time, but you don't have to toss a coin for the effect, <a data-name=""The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> can get a tuner if you don't have <a data-name=""Unknown Synchron"">Unknown Synchron</a> but a compass token for example. <a data-name=""The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> can also be used to get a fast <a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a> to spawn a random card from either Graveyard but you can only use it without other monsters and when the opponent already has cards on the field.  <a data-name=""The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a> – With <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> you can summon a <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a>, with any effect monster you can summon <a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a> for a better effect negation, and if you already turned a <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a> to <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> you can summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> which is the best fusion summon option if you get the cards for it.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>, <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> -  <a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Millenium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a> can be summoned with the effect of <a data-name=""The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a> can be summoned by it's own effect when you have <a data-name=""Metal Reflect Slime"">Metal Reflect Slime</a>, you can either fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> then with it or you can use it to defend because it has to be destroyed before your opponennt can attack your other monsters and it can not be destroyed ba battle. <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> has a very good effect negation, and effect negations are very good together with the already strong destroy-effects of the barrel dragons and some other cards, to get a fusion summon to summon it you need 2 <a data-name=""The Dark – Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a> in total, or use only 1 and one <a data-name=""instant fusion"">instant fusion</a> or you can use one and the <a data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</a>. <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> is only in the deck for <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> because it is a better target than <a data-name=""Millenium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a>.  <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>, <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, <a data-name=""Triple Burst Dragon"">Triple Burst Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> –  <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> and <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> can make Tokens to effect monsters to then use the link monster effects of <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and draw cards with it and to summon the link-3 and link-4 monsters. <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> is the strongest card because of it's immunity against card effects and it's destroy-effect in battle, and can be fast summoned with the tokens of <a data-name=""Cosmic Compass"">Cosmic Compass</a> or <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>. <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a> is the alternative if you need more atk against one monster, when you get a <a data-name=""Triple burst dragon"">Triple burst dragon</a> before you summon <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a> you can attack with 4400 atk for one turn, and it is easier to summon <a data-name=""Rasterliger"">Rasterliger</a> than <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> because you only need 2 monsters when you already have link-2 or link-3 monsters.  <a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a> – It can be rarely used, because it's uncommon to get 2 <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a>s or a <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Jinzo"">Jinzo</a>, but if that happens, then you can use <a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a> to steal the opponent monsters.  <a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a>, <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a> – 2 Good Synchro monsters - <a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a> just for stall with a lvl 4 and a lvl 1 monster, and <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a> to destroy one monster with it's effect without throwing a coin.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> - The draw-engine, with <a data-name=""allure of darkness"">allure of darkness</a> you can summon monsters with <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark Dimension"">Escape from the Dark Dimension</a> later. For <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> you have 5 monsters you can use, the <a data-name=""Desperado Barrel Dragon"">Desperado Barrel Dragon</a>s have an effect that will give you a <a data-name=""Blowback Dragon"">Blowback Dragon</a> to the hand, and <a data-name=""Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi, The Serpentron Sky Slasher</a> can be tributed for free because you can summon it from the Graveyard. If you use or want to use <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a> you can not special summon this turn but it's very effective and can get you the right traps and spells or another draw-card. With <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity you can Ban </a><a data-name=""Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth"">Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth</a><a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">, </a><a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a><a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">, </a><a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">Jinzo - Layered</a><a data-name=""Jinzo - Layered"">, </a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">, </a><a data-name=""Gatling Dragon"">Gatling Dragon</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus""> and </a><a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus""> without losing the main combo's which makes it a great card and easier to use than </a><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">.</a>  <a data-name=""Heavy Metal Raiders"">Heavy Metal Raiders</a> – If you get it all your dark machines can not get destroyed by battle anymore, which makes it easy to use the effects of them, without it they tend to be slow, but with it, it can get very fast and everytime you destroy a card with a dark machine you can summon another one from the hand. You can also attack monsters with higher atk to get the same atk as them, but you have to pay the difference in life points, this can be very helpful against cards that have effect immunity and can only be destroyed by battle.  <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>, <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a> – Effect negations make it much easier to destroy monsters with the monster effects that you have anyway, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> is a good backup card that can trigger <a data-name=""Chain Whirlwind"">Chain Whirlwind</a>.  <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion, </a><a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> – <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> is great to get either a link monster faster, or to fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> when you have <a data-name=""The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a>.

I ended up going 5-3 and finished 46th out of about 190 players. The tri-brigade package ended up doing ALOT more then I thought they would. The main goal is to get zeus or megaclopis out. It normally takes a decent amount of resources and planning for your opponent to get over zeus or megaclopis so being able to then pivot into the link 4 tri-brigade and re build your board is extremely effective. Also, the link 4's non targeting banishing is HUGE in removing tough cards on the field. Also the when the link 4 is sent to the gy it allows you to search ad it does not have to be a tri-brigade monster (if you have 8 banished you can even grab alpha). Still working on what hand traps I need to be playing but overall I was very pleased with how this deck performed."

Used for CYS 29/11/20.,"This deck is not particularly good. However, I really like the playstyle of U.A. and I was interested in taking its actually promising core of an omni-negate, strong card destruction, consistency, and occasional runaway wins with Jersey and turning it into something more. Naturally, I added Dogmatikas to the list. The vast majority of the metagame right now summons from the Extra Deck and you're ideally going second with this deck, so your Dogmatikas <em>should </em>be switched on by default.  Some notes:  -This deck was made for the CYS series 29/11/20, and so <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> was not legal. I recommend cutting the <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>/<a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">U.A. Penalty Box</a> engine and replacing <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> with <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> if you're playing in a format with it legal, adding a Powered Jersey and playing around with maindecking varying numbers of handtraps, Dogmatika Punishment and DRNM with the remaining space. Having played both forms of the deck, the Disparity version is slightly better, but this edition is more battle-tested and more consistent for the U.A.s with the Penalty Box engine.  -This deck has a major weakness to <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon. Our only real outs in the maindeck are hoping that </a><a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted</a><a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">, U.A. Penalty Box's banish effect or </a><a data-name=""U.A. Player Manager"">U.A. Player Manager's non-targeted negation resolve,</a><a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box""> and Gamciel</a><a data-name=""U.A. Penalty Box"">. Thankfully, with the big boy himself negated or popped with a kaiju we have a variety of card destruction effects to clear the rest of the field and.... relatively resilient lines of play, should there still be interaction up.</a>  -If you go first, you ideally use both your Stadiums together to normal summon the same <a data-name=""U.A. Libero Spiker"">U.A. Libero Spiker</a> twice and search three times, ending on a board of <a data-name=""U.A. Perfect Ace"">U.A. Perfect Ace and </a><a data-name=""U.A. Blockbacker"">U.A. Blockbacker in defense position and a </a><a data-name=""U.A. Libero Spiker"">U.A. Libero Spiker</a><a data-name=""U.A. Blockbacker""> whose effect you will activate at some point in the opponents' turn to disrupt their play with either another Ace or a </a><a data-name=""U.A. Player Manager"">U.A. Player Manager. </a><a data-name=""U.A. Stadium"">U.A. Stadium's ATK-increasing effect can be more or less ignored turn 1, but is very important to consider going second and on subsequent turns.</a>  -If you go second: Dunkers and Dogmatikas. Just... figure it out. Against a board of multiple omni-negates you're probably going to fold unless you draw Gamciel or sideboarded DRNM, but the deck is surprisingly effective at breaking boards that aren't quite so disruptive! You can run away with games that would otherwise be lost surprisingly easily by abusing <a data-name=""U.A. Dreadnought Dunker"">U.A. Dreadnought Dunker</a>'s high ATK, piercing battle damage, and card destruction along with <a data-name=""U.A. Powered Jersey"">U.A. Powered Jersey</a>'s excess damage doubling and twice-per-turn (if you kill a monster) attacking. <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> is also extremely powerful, sending <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss to the GY for card destruction and starting your Dogmatika chain is a lot of value for one card.</a>  -Dark Ruler No More switches off Dunker's effect. I have made this mistake way too many times, and so I'm now maindecking Gamciel rather than DRNM - the anti-synergy is just really really bad, but sometimes you do need DRNM so it's in the sideboard.  -As always, sideboarding is important. DRNM and Nibiru are my most common swap-ins, but <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> are of course very useful in situations that demand them. Graveyard hate is on there too because, graveyard hate.  -The small amount of the effect U.A.s, cut to free up space for the Dogmatikas and to make the deck less bricky, means that the deck runs out of steam against boardclears pretty quickly. If you want to run Rebounder to shore up this weakness, don't, the card sucks. I've been playing various variants of U.A. for a month or so now and I've literally never resolved its effect.  -please don't blame me for you losing i'm working with an archetype that was weak even for 2015 when it was released and im jamming a good current archetype in to bring it a little up to speed  &nbsp;"

Chazz is my favorite character in all of Yu-Gi-Oh and I love all the different designs for Armed Dragons, Ojama, VWXYZ. So, this deck tries to bring all the different kinds of Armed Dragons out semi consistently while keeping to the Chazz's anime deck as closely as possible while doing so. I also made this playable in the TCG format.  Update:  Removed about 5 cards to make the deck more consistent and gave the extra deck more firepower.  Summary:  At the start of the duel, you try to bring out Armed Dragon Thunder LV3 as fast as possible using Dragon Flash or Ojamatching. Once you have Armed Dragon Thunder LV3 that way you can start sacrificing cards to help you get to <span>Armed Dragon Thunder LV10</span>. Then use Armed Dragon Blitz on <span>Armed Dragon Thunder LV10</span> to bring out <span>Armed Dragon LV 10</span>. If you are lucky you pull out an Armed Dragon Lighting or OjamaPajama to give your Armed Dragons extra protection. Armed Dragon Lighting can bring back Armed Dragon monster with equal or less stars than the one on the field you use this to keep bringing back  Armed Dragon Thunder LV 7 your hand and keep discarding it to the graveyard to pull out <span><span>Armed Dragon LV10- White</span></span> or Armed Dragon Thunderbolt incase Armed Dragon Lighting is destroyed.  To summon <span>Armed Dragon LV10- White</span>, you will have Banish 10 stars on the field or graveyard my play is 2 Armed Dragon LV5 in the graveyard. Next, Ojamapajama can sacrifice Ojamamagic for more Ojama cards to discard for effects or use it for ojamadification to bring out <span>Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon</span>. <span>Dark Armed Dragon </span>which I really had trouble putting in this deck but, I think it fits a little since Chazz used Chthonian (dark monsters) I don’t see why he wouldn't use Burning Abyss cards. The Burning Abyss works pretty good since Graff can be used as LV up requirements and he can be easily tossed in the grave to bring out Scram then when Scram is in the graveyard you pull another Burning Abyss monster from your deck which in the end phase is another Graff. Finally, once all three of them are dead you simply just sacrifice Armed Dragon Thunder LV7 to add <span>Dark Armed Dragon </span>to your hand to special summon. Then your board is finally complete with almost every important Armed Dragon boss monsters besides (<span>Metaphys Armed Dragon</span>) we don't talk about him though.  &nbsp;  Extra Notes:  Lastly, I couldn’t add Ojama Pink since I haven't tested him so he will be up later and try to keep the card count low. And if you have any suggestions pls message me I want to hear your guy's opinion on this deck and how I can improve it.

This deck is for you. It's worked well for me so far.,"I love playing Heroes but I was tired of people winning games by throwing out Dragoon mid-game and winning. So I threw in my Super Polys, said f*ck the hand trap clutter, and decided to main deck S/T removal because back row and floodgates can suck a fat one. Your opponent uses Ash Blossom? Well that sucks but I got 2 more searches and Ash is a hard once per turn or I got the 1 Called By The Grave.  Chain Mask Change on your Stratos when your opponent tries to Imperm or Effect Veiler your monster. Search still goes through.  Fusion Destiny is great but you don't need 3. U can only use it twice really and otherwise it becomes a huge brick. I remember I needed something like Stratos but drew Fusion Destiny after all my targets for it are in grave or banished mid game. Scoop. With 2 you have a chance to draw 1 and decrease your chance of bricking with 2 or drawing one when you don't need it.  Some people may be saddened that the Evil Hero package is not present. Yeah I love using Bane too but he's not necessary to win. For those who don't have him yet this also makes my build more budget. If there was room I'd add him in but I like keeping my decks as close to 40 cards as possible.  &nbsp;  For the Extra Deck I add Starving Venom, Escuridao, and The Shining purely for Super Poly. Super Poly is not once per turn and that won me one game against Dragon Link. ""Oh you have a negate for Nibiru or some other hand trap? That's cool."" Super Poly ends that conversation.  In that game against Dragon Link my opponent ended his turn one board with Dragoon, Verte, and a Herald of Arc Light. I summoned Solid Soldier, used Super Poly. Fused off Verte and Goon into Starving Venom, played the 2nd fused Herald and Solid Soldier for Shining. He took away his negates, did my combo and OTKed.  Everything else in the deck is what you expect from HEROs. Absolute Zero can work as a Super Poly option as well if your playing against a Water deck.  &nbsp;  The power of HEROs is their Flexibility in my opinion. You got a Hero or card for most of what you will face now whether you can get to that Hero and maintain him on the field is a different story. For everything else I got what is in my side deck. Go right ahead and fix ur side deck for whatever you normally deal with but for my Side deck I got simple options. The Main Deck is good either first or second. Got the Twisters/Duster for the Backrow and Super Poly for the annoyances. Most decks want to go first now a days that includes HEROs.  I'd rather put my Law, Absolute/Acid, or Plasma on the field to stop my opponent from playing or setting up. If going first I can set Poly or Twisters/Duster. So Game 1 I win because my deck is prepared or I lose because some BS. Going to Game 2 I opt to go first and side out Polys or Twisters/Duster for whatever I just faced. Altergeist or a trap focused deck? Decree/Reboot. Spell heavy decks like Striker for example. Anti Spell Fragrance just make sure your board is ready before u activate cause it will screw us too so gotta becareful. Combo deck? Droll or Nibiru. Lancea is pretty much for Dinos. I threw in Great Tornado to help combat Virtual Worlds.  &nbsp;  Anyways try it out tell me what you think."

This deck has two main functions that are the core of the deck.  a)Get Red-Eyes Slash Dragon out as fast as possible and continue to summon/revive your cards in the process.  b)Get Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword attached to any of your monsters to create a beat stick. This would preferably be Slash Dragon for the safety reason, but anything works really.  Rocket Hermos and Time Magic Hammer are there in case either main functions don't work out. Really, the three oddity cards (Time Wizard, Rocket Warrior, Amazoness Swords Woman) are there for security purposes.  -Time Wizard gives you a chance to gamble away your opponents cards.  -Amazoness Swords Woman allows you to possibly blow up your opponent (or at least disrupt their strategy) by launching yourself into their own beat stick.  -Rocket Warrior is useless, but he looks cool.  A/D changer is very useful when summoning Slash Dragon, as he allows you easy access to changing your opponents cards positions.  &nbsp;  If it's turn one, it's best to use A/D changer when summoning Slash Dragon, as you won't get to attach him immediately anyway.  If you are on turn two+, you are best using one of the other warrior cards.  &nbsp;  All of the XYZ cards are just there because their artwork looks kinda cool.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

So, with this deck I made it a going second deck and you need to use all of your handtraps to use on the opponent and them destroy them with dark magician spam on the next turn. If they are running something that can run through basically any handtrap (Dragon link) I also have evenly matched in the main deck. If you want to win I wouldn't advise playing this deck, Just play dragon link.

Your goal is simple: Get rid of any problematic monsters with your Kaiju cards, while also making your normal plays with your Burning Abyss monsters. Because BA is possibly the most xenophobic archetype in Yu-Gi-Oh, you absolutely <em><strong>cannot</strong></em> have the Main Deck BA monsters and Kaijus out without also controlling Cherubini, or Fiendish Rhino Warrior.  &nbsp;  However, if you need to go first, you're not totally screwed. You can use Cherubini and IP: Masquerena to link summon Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. There's only so much your opponent can do against a Link 4 that can't be targeted or destroyed by card effects,  and will destroy most Special Summoned monsters by battle. And even if your opponent does send it to the Graveyard, you can shuffle a card on the field into the deck without targeting!  &nbsp;  I named this deck ""Who Will Know"", after the theme song of Shin Godzilla, the antagonist of the 2016 movie <em>Shin Godzilla</em>. I actually watched this movie about a month ago, and it was one of the best Godzilla movies I've ever seen, so I made this Burning Abyss Kaiju deck in honor of it. I'm not gonna give any spoilers, but Shin Godzilla is quite possibly the creepiest design that the Big G has ever had! He looks like he just crawled out of Hell, so it was kind of appropriate.    In addition to that, the movie does have quite a bit of blood and grotesque imagery, including a scene where small Godzilla-human hybrids are seen <em><strong>growing out of Shin Godzilla's tail</strong></em>. So if you're a fan of body horror, monster movies, or just the king of monsters, <em>Shin Godzilla</em> is the movie for you!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The name here is in reference to Legendary Pictures and Toho, the two film studios which made every Godzilla movie except Godzilla 1998. We don't talk about Godzilla 1998. But given the medival/RPG theme of Crusadia, and the presence of Kaijus in this deck, ""Legendary Kingdom Toho"" was an appropriate name for it.  &nbsp;  While Crusadia is already a go-second deck, adding Kaijus to them will take this to an absolute extreme. Your goal with Kaijus is to use them to get rid of your opponent's monsters, while also giving yourself a big beater. As for the Crusadia monsters, your goal is to use them to link climb into the best Link Monster you can summon. And in a lot of cases for me, that was Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. If the Crusadia monsters summoned themselves from the hand in Attack Position, I'd be using Borrelsword a LOT more. But Borrelsword is still a great monster if you get to summon it.  &nbsp;  Thankfully, Crusadia Arboria is a Tuner. So after searching Crusadia Testament with Crusadia Regulex, you can special summon Arboria, and use them both to summon Crystron Halquifibrax, using it to summon another Arboria. Then you can special summon another Crusadia monster from your hand, use both Crusadia monsters to summon IP: Masquerena. Then use Halq and Masquerena to link summon Avramax! By the way, sitting on an Avramax that was Link Summoned with Masquerena is gonna be your only first-turn play.  &nbsp;  If you do that, you'll be having a Link Monster that can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's effects, protects your other monsters from being attacked, and can't be destroyed by battle with most Special Summoned monsters. Oh, and if your opponent CAN destroy it by battle, just banish Arboria from your field or Graveyard! In addition, if Avramax destroys a monster by battle, then you can activate Crusadia Testament and draw 4 cards!  &nbsp;  Really, in a lot of cases, I don't OTK with this souped-up Avramax, but my opponent surrenders because they don't have any cards that can get rid of it."

New Eldlich cards are in the pipe, but not particularly interesting to me anyways. Still, I decided to update the list slightly for the times.  Eldlich line-up is still the same, I don't see much reason to change anything. You could run another White Eldlixir if you wanted, just to run more Eldlixirs, but space is tight, so I don't want to. We're running 3 Golden Lord, 3 Cursed Eldland to see Golden Lord, and 3 Red Eldlixir with 1 White to summon Golden Lord. 3 of each trap monster makes a lot of sense to me, you want searchable interaction, you want bodies on the table, and these get you those. We run a single Golden Land Forever! since it is searchable, rounding us out with a good omni-negate, and 3 Solemn Judgement. Judgement could be something else, I just like having answers to Feather Duster and Lightning Storm that are generically useful. This card can also negate summons of monsters at Spell Speed 3, which is nothing to sneeze at. It doesn't answer effects that activate in places other than the field, but it's a useful generic trap that makes you harder to out and answers anything that hits the table.  For Dogmatika line-up ,we're still eschewing Maxmimus, and instead are running 3 of each starter and 2 of each searching target. Dogmatika Punishment is, in my opinion, a powerful generic trap in its own right. The restrictions on it keep it from being played in everything, but if you don't need the extra deck the card is pushed. It pops 2, or pops 1 and searches, and since Dogma likes putting extra deck monsters in the GY this is simultaneously one of the best interruptions in the game and essentially extra searchers. Fleurdelis I'm not as high on, obviously generic negation that doesn't target is good, and it is the Dogma engine's main way to output damage, but it doesn't do anything if you don't see Ecclesia. You still need 2 to search out over the course of the game, but unlike Punishment I wouldn't ever consider running 3.  Shaddoll Schism is the deck's other true brick. You do not want to see this card - you DO however want to discard Golden Lord off of Nadir Servant AND search a trap to use to summon it back. This one brick dramatically increases the consistency of the deck by adding that optional discard option, and even without any Shaddolls to pay it off pulls its weight. I highly recommend it in Eldlich/Dogma builds. I tried running Shaddolls you could fusion summon with it, but tbh they weren't worth the space in the extra deck.  For hand traps we're running 3 Imperm, a good generic field negate that has the advantage of being a trap card, which is important in an Eldlich deck, 3 Ash Blossom, a good generic hand trap that is also one of the only ones that hits Virtual World, and Skull Meister, which splits the difference between D.D. Crow and Lancea, good against Dinos and Virtual World, while still being generic enough to hit other commons decks in some way, such as slowing down Eldlich or Dogmatika, and interrupting combos (if not at their weakest points). I needed hand traps that would be useful against Virtual World while remaining impactful against the rest of the meta, and while Imperm kind of misses the bill, it makes up for it by summoning Golden Lord.  Extra deck is actually mostly to dump. Apkallone is how we're extra deck dumps to put Golden Lords in the bin. Titaniklad (that Bastard) is typitcally what makes Nadir Servant such a broken card, and is part of the reason Dogmatika Punishment is such a broken card, and you want 2 of them. 3 N'tss might be a little high, but I wanted an extra one, to occasionally ditch with Nadir Servant. I think at least 1 for each Punishment is correct - might as well get the full value out of punishment. Wind Pegasus trades removal for removal, it's a good thing to ditch when you have Nadir Servant with another Dogma card in hand. The Cyber Dragon Nova / Invoked Mechaba engine is run in case people Maximus the deck - these aren't strictly necessary but there's space for them. Maybe you'd like I:P or other extra deck monsters over it, I just like the cheeky wins.  The Trains are where we start to get into the things you summon. Dogma cards really restrict your options in terms of summoning from the extra deck, but the trains are here for Eldlich OTKS, Vampire Sucker is here to draw cards when the game is in a simplified state, and to put Golden Lords and Golden Land monsters back into the GY, and is probably the monster I summon most from the extra deck. You could run 2 Suckers, and it would make sense, (maybe over the Nova package). Obligatory Knightmares give the deck some spell/trap removal in the extra deck, and occasionally come up. Borreload Dragon could in theory come up, it gives the extra deck a hard to answer form of removal, but realistically you're barely going into the extra deck, so maybe this could be something else.  Token Collector is a really good card against Auroradon combos, most notable Infernoble Knights, and is situationally useful against Linkross as well. Gnomaterial can help stop Zoodiac, that's literally all it is here for. After that it's a suite of backrow removal, including Pankratops, and 3 Appointer of the Red Lotus for when you're going first, to stop those blow-out cards like Feather Duster and Lightning Storm, which will be more common game 2-3."

Traditional Core with some support.,"The deck features a back to basics core quite similar to a pure Cyber Dragon deck with some spice for various matchups. Monsters in the main are my tailor-made picks for A <strong>40</strong> card standard, featuring support monsters primarily being <strong>Light/Machine</strong>. For those of you wanting a <strong>60</strong> card variant, feel free to toss in the side deck along with the typical commonplace staples <em>(IE: Ash, Twin twisters, .etc) </em>While I recommend the base 40 for streamlined optimization &amp; mitigating the chances of dead draws, a deck of 60 does boost your <strong>OTK</strong> damage with the utilization of the Chimeratech cards.  Moving forward, while the main deck was dedicated to the core build, there is some variation however in the Extra Deck, giving you choices for counter-plays &amp; going 2nd which I feel supplement the deck nicely but still give it that classic feel. As for the staple spells, many people play with ""<strong>3 Ofs</strong>"" but I find that running <strong>2</strong> for certain cards can sometimes be the golden ratio.  But of course, for those who can't do without, feel free to make adjustments by utilizing the side deck backups or make changes by swapping out some cards to accommodate your playstyle. For those looking to pick up Cydra or coming back to it, your bread &amp; butter win condition is still mainly <strong>Fusion</strong> <strong>+ OTK</strong> for big damage/multiple attacks. This deck was built with that fundamental in mind but also with simplicity to be played casually by those looking to have fun with the archetype and for those who want to strategically play Cyber Dragons with something more than pure but without going too far off in the deep end with variants. <em>(IE: Infinitracks, Calamity, Orcust .etc) </em>  That being said, the deck is quite adaptable so play as you see fit.

""Simorgh"" is actually a pretty interesting archetype in my opinion, stemming from the first Wind-Attribute Structure Deck back in the day which included ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Divinity"">Simorgh, Bird of Divinity</a>"" as its boss monster and gave one of the biggest monsters in the archetype ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" its name. ""Simorgh"" as an archetype consists entirely of Winged Beasts and the strategy puts its focus on interaction with both players backrows and Normal/Tribute Summoning. In case you are wondering: Since I want to mention some of the interactions in the deck, I will not go strictly by monster, backrow, Extra Deck, but instead mention whatever comes naturally and makes sense at that point in time.</p> <p>For starters, the deck actively makes use of its smaller members: ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Beginning"">Simorgh, Bird of Beginning</a>"" gives you another Normal Summon upon being Normal Summoned, which makes it a great monster to include into your summon chain if you have anything else to summon afterwards; ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Bringing"">Simorgh, Bird of Bringing</a>"" is the archetypal searcher and therefore fetches you whatever card you need or is missing; and ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"" is a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" on legs, allowing for easy Link climbing with certain cards form the Extra Deck. All of those monsters have an additional effect that allows you to Special Summon them from the graveyard if the opponent has no backrow, but they get banished afterwards and locks your Extra Deck summons into the Winged Beast-typing. However, this effect allows you to get further mileage out of your monsters and is paramount for setting up a strong board; but I will come to that.</p> <p>The bigger monsters in form of ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" provide useful control effects in form of negates and bounces, but while ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" only goes back to the hand from your graveyard when a Winged Beast monster in destroyed in battle, ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" actually serves as solid recurring beater, since it will enter the field from either the hand or the graveyard when a Tribute Summon occurs. You can therefore set it up in the graveyard, Tribute Summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</a>"" and gain the other bird for free. This notion is also supported by ""<a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>"", which can discard ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" since it is a Level 8 monster and ""<a data-name=""Simorgh Onslaught"">Simorgh Onslaught</a>"", which will search for further useful monsters while putting ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" right where you want to have it.</p> <p>The most important Extra Deck monster to summon by far is ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"". This beast allows you free Winged Beast monster summons from the deck and sets up ""<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>"" to stop most opponent's Special Summons or ""<a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a>"" to keep the opponent from using Spell cards rightaway. On top of that it has various protection-esque effects that make handling your board that much harder. Going into this monster is very much possible with the aforementioned smaller ""Simorgh"" monsters: You can get up to three Normal Summons per turn in the archetype (the one Normal Summon you have anyway, one via ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Beginning"">Simorgh, Bird of Beginning</a>"" and one via ""<a data-name=""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh</a>"") which is exactly the number of monsters needed for ""<a data-name=""Bird of Sovereignty"">Bird of Sovereignty</a>"". But there are also better options available. Since all of the small birds can be re-summoned, you can make elaborate summoning chains with no real cost or effort: Summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"", ditch any of the Level 1-4 ""Simorgh"" monsters, re-summon the ditched monster, Special Summon ""<a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a>"" from your Extra Deck, then re-summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"" to use both it and ""<a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a>"" to summon ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"". That is, while it uses multiple cards to get it running, a combo that only uses one card from your hand to work. There are various other scenarios you can use with the small bird, just keep in mind that you want to get the free summon of ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"" at the end of it all, so there should be a certain priority attached to summoning it.</p> <p>The rest of the Main Deck monsters serves to help the board come into shape: ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Protection"">Simorgh, Bird of Protection</a>"" works similarly to the other small ""Simorgh"" in that it has the same re-summoning effect but actually takes care of pesky backrow should that be required. It is simply not that highly needed and can be searched, so I only run one copy of it. ""<a data-name=""Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite"">Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite</a>"" has a recurrence effect similar to the smaller ""Simorghs"" but also features the Dark Attribute, which allows you to summon ""<a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a>"" via its own effect more often. Talking about ""<a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a>"", the deck can use the ""Dark Simorgh lock"" with relative ease, which is exactly the reason why there are two copies of ""<a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a>"" in the deck. Stopping the opponent from using Spell cards temporarily is nice, but barring them from using such cards altogether is better. ""<a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>"" is a very nice addition in my opinion and was/is commonly used in combination with ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>""; but in a pure ""Simorgh"" deck, you even have the option of summoning it during your summon chain since ""<a data-name=""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh</a>"" allows the summon of any Wind Winged Beast monster, not just ""Simorgh"". ""<a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a>"" is a solid option for effect negation that can also be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>""; there is also the option of running the combo with ""<a data-name=""Mist Valley Thunderbird"">Mist Valley Thunderbird</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>"", but that was too expensive in my opinion. Lastly ""<a data-name=""Raiza the Mega Monarch"">Raiza the Mega Monarch</a>"" is a Wind Winged Beast that profits from being Tribute Summoned and seemed to be a pretty strong option in certain situations, so in it goes.</p> <p>The backrow is rather straightforward: Three ""<a data-name=""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh</a>"" give stat boosts, easier Tribute Summoning and further Normal Summons, three ""<a data-name=""Simorgh Onslaught"">Simorgh Onslaught</a>"" work as the double searchers and setup for cards like ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"", two ""<a data-name=""The Monarchs Stormforth"">The Monarchs Stormforth</a>"" can clear the opposing field while you profit via Tribute Summons, two ""<a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a>"" as helpful and inexpensive draw options, two ""<a data-name=""Simorgh Repulsion"">Simorgh Repulsion</a>"" against opposing backrow, ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" for the same setup scenario I described when talking about ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for obvious monster revival, and one ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" to have access to the Field Spell more often. The Traps consist of two copies of ""<a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a>"", which I have already explained and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a>"" as pretty insane effect negation.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is pretty budget-friendly in my opinion and leaves room for changes: ""<a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>"" is both useful for Link Climbing and a pretty solid option overall, ""<a data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</a>"" is used for the Link Climbing into ""<a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Rubberband Shooter"">Hi-Speedroid Rubberband Shooter</a>"" is another option for more Normal Summons, both ""<a data-name=""Fire-Fighting Daruma Doll"">Fire-Fighting Daruma Doll</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" serve as backrow removal and the two Xyz options can be reached with relative ease if ""<a data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</a>"" is involved. A cheap monster removal option that one can climb into is possible with the three monsters ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Detonate Deleter"">Detonate Deleter</a>"": If ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" is summoned first, you can bounce one monster via ""<a data-name=""Security Dragon"">Security Dragon</a>"" since it will be linked with the Link Arrow from ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"". If you then go into ""<a data-name=""Detonate Deleter"">Detonate Deleter</a>"", you can use one of the excess ""Simorghs"" to tribute for its effect to get rid of another monster, while a third would automatically be destroyed via the first effect of ""<a data-name=""Detonate Deleter"">Detonate Deleter</a>"", handling a total of three monsters if unimpeded. Granted, the combo is easily negate- and obstructable, but it is a dirt-cheap way to gain board control in certain situations.</p> <p>I found ""Simorgh"" to be a fun and interactive archetype that can be scaled upwards if the budget allows it. As usual, I wrote a more in-depth analysis about the entire archetype and all cards in it plus useful cards and hints that I simply cannot all fit in here.

The point of this deck is to control the actions that your opponent takes with each of the<strong> Security Force</strong> monsters doing something different. You aren't that able to interact with your opponent by moving around your <strong>Security Force</strong> monsters very often on their turn as <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Specimen"">Security Force Specimen</a></strong> is a hard once per turn for each effect and it is decently hard to put it into your graveyard. The only way you can really truly interact with your opponent on their turn is if you run <strong><a data-name=""Reinforce Truth"">Reinforce Truth</a></strong> in the maindeck, but I highly advise against it as it doesn't do anything if you are forced to go second; most it can do is be a discard for<strong> Magicians' Soul</strong>'s draw effect.  The <strong>Security Force</strong> lineup consists of playsets of <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Pla-Tina"">Security Force Pla-Tina</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Gravitino"">Security Force Gravitino</a></strong>, <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Orifice"">Security Force Orifice</a></strong>, and<strong> <a data-name=""Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru"">Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru</a></strong>. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Security Force Professor Digamma&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Security Force Professor Digamma</strong> </a>is a terrible card whose control effect is very niche and doesn't come up for the most part in modern Yu-Gi-Oh!. Restrictions on Battle Positions will only prevent you from getting OTKed, but most decks are focusing more on making negated instead which is why we aren't running him even though he is a target for <strong>E-Tele</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru"">Security Force Rappa Chiyomaru</a></strong> is your one card starter. He/She (I really don't know) bounces him/herself and banishes a <strong>Security Force</strong> monster from your hand to SS one from your deck. Also there's an almost irrelevant attacking restriction for your opponent. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Pla-Tina"">Security Force Pla-Tina</a></strong> lowers the ATK of your opponent's monsters in columns w/ <strong>Security Force</strong> monsters. The important thing about her is that 1) She's a <strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> target and 2) She SS a banished <strong>Security Force</strong> monster which means you can summon the <strong>Security Force</strong> monster that you banished off of <strong>Chiyomaru</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Gravitino"">Security Force Gravitino</a></strong> banishes monsters in the same column as it when they leave the field and it searches a security force card on summon. This is the card you most want to banish off of<strong> Chiyomaru</strong> since it has a very relevant control effect and it searches any card in the archetype.<strong> <a data-name=""Security Force Orifice"">Security Force Orifice</a></strong> prevents your opponent targeting their monsters with effects in the same column as <strong>Security Force</strong> monsters and he can destroy a monster upon their effect activation after you banish a<strong> Security Force</strong> from hand. It doesn't negate which is unfortunate, but it can deal with some(?) decks' starters and provide adequate banishing set-up.  The other monsters in the main deck provide more set-up for your Security Force plays. <strong><a data-name=""Edea the Heavenly Squire"">Edea the Heavenly Squire</a></strong> summons <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> from deck and <strong><a data-name=""Eidos the Underworld Squire"">Eidos the Underworld Squire</a></strong> summons <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> from grave. They both get you to<strong> Chiyomaru</strong> to start your plays, but they restrict Extra Deck summoning which is okay going first sometimes, but they can be a downside going second. You choose to just run 1 <strong>Edea</strong> if you want to make more Extra Deck plays and don't want to see her in your hand all the time. <strong>Eidos</strong> is only run at 1 since you usually are not going to have <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> in your grave for the most part as he/she is safely tucked in your hand (except when you get hit by <strong>Smoke Grenade</strong>). He can be a target for <strong><a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a></strong> when you have access to the extra deck. This allows you to have an easier time getting him into the grave. <strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> sends <strong>Pla-Tina</strong> to grave and is extra draws in this deck yada-yada.  Spell line-up is mostly <strong>Security Force</strong> cards. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Showdown"">Security Force Showdown</a></strong> is an extender and recycles your graveyard <strong>Security Forces</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Security Force Bridgehead"">Security Force Bridgehead</a></strong> is another banishing target for <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> and <strong>Orifice</strong>, but it does search a <strong>Security Force</strong> monster on resolution. It mainly combos with <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> to make your monsters immune to battle destruction. <strong><a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a></strong> is for <strong>Edea</strong>. <strong>ROTA</strong> is for <strong>Chiyomaru</strong> (or <strong>Edea</strong>). <strong><a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a></strong> is nice in this deck as your Extra Deck isn't that important and it's not <strong><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a></strong> which means you can use it to search extenders after your main plays.  Trap line-up is pretty normal.<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Infinite Impermanence&lt;/strong&gt;""> <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong></a> for negation and more column control. <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Security Force Specimen&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Security Force Specimen</strong> </a>summons a <strong>Security Force</strong> monster from grave or that is banished. It also allows for some column control, but its not the best as each effect of it is a hard once per turn. <strong><a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a></strong> gets you to normal traps faster. And<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt; Imperial Order&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong> Imperial Order</strong> </a>since this deck doesn't ""rely"" on spells as other decks do (by that I mean just discard them off of <strong>Magicians' Souls</strong> to draw more cards under <strong>Imperial Order</strong>).  Extra Deck is nothing special. 3 <strong>N'tss</strong> because we have much free space. <strong>Avramax</strong> is an option to wall yourself off. <strong>Accesscode Selene</strong> combo since we are running spellcasters.<strong> Equimax</strong> to link off monsters and for mucho damage. 2<strong> <a data-name=""Security Force Justify"">Security Force Justify</a></strong> to go second or first since it's a negate and removal of up to 3 monsters. <strong>Knightmare</strong> package of course.<strong> Union Carrier</strong> to link off monsters and to equip <strong>Eidos</strong>. <strong><a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a></strong> as another option to link off monsters. And<a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Relinquished Anima&lt;/strong&gt;""> <strong>Relinquished Anima</strong> </a>and <strong><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></strong> to make use of lvl 1's.  Side deck. 3 <strong><a data-name=""Wattkinetic Puppeteer"">Wattkinetic Puppeteer</a></strong> which you can choose to maindeck. 3 <strong>Ash</strong>. 3 <strong>Cosmic</strong>. 3 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Warning Point&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Warning Point</strong> </a>and 3 <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Banquet of Millions&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Banquet of Millions</strong> </a>since they're <strong>Trap Trick</strong> targets and since you don't care for your Extra Deck.  &nbsp;"

Assumi","I will begin by saying this deck is not meta at all but is really fun to play with and the art work is incredible (not to mention that all the Rikka cards are Ultra / Super / Secret Rare).  First, the perfect hand. Hopefully your hand starts with one copy of Rikka petal at the best or at least one copy of lonefire as this allows you to start drawing the all important Rikka cards we need to be able to have a successful field. <ul>  	<li>If you draw Rikka Petal: Start by normal summoning this card and activating his effect to search to the hand Snowdrop (if you don't already have her in your hand).</li>  	<li>If you draw Lonefire Blossom: Normal summon lonefire blossom right away and active its effect to special summon Rikka Petal from your deck.</li> </ul> Once you have Snowdrop in your hand, activate her effect from your hand to tribute Rikka Petal and special summon both Snowdrop and a card of your choice from your hand. This is where it is highly dependant on what cards you have in your hand although at this stage (if nothing has been negated yet) you should be able to get an XYZ card out on the field.  Theres two ways you can end your first turn: <ul>  	<li>1) Either use snowdrops effect to get out any of the three Tytannial, Chirubime, or Talaya out to the field. If you have Chirubime is in your hand i would advise special summoning this card right away to allow better field protection. End your turn with snowdrop and one of those cards in defence position.</li>  	<li>2) Use snowdrops effect to special summon any other plant monster in your hand. Activate snowdrops second effect to make all monsters on your side of the field become the level of a monster on your field. I generally choose snowdrops level (8) so that i can special summon from the extra deck Alsei. Special summon Alsei in defence position and end your turn.</li> </ul> Turns after your first turn, you generally want to focus on getting Aromseraphy Jasime out and pointing towards Chirubime as that is a sort of stun for the appoint. Chirubime's effect means it is the only monster on your side of the field who can be targeted for an attack and pair that with Jasmines effect, it then cannot be destroyed by battle. At this point focus on getting Teardrop Rikka Queen XYZ summoned so you can activate her effect to remove from play an opponents field monster.  Assuming your opponent doesnt have any negation when they end their turn, you can rinse and repeat your first turn with rikka petal. Use rikka petals effect to special summon it to your field again and then repeat grab Snowdrop from your deck.  Spells and Traps:  AS soon as you can, use Mudan's effect to get Rikka Flurries activated. Each time you tribute (which will be a lot) , you can activate that effect to get your opponent to remove from play one of their monsters (at that choice). The other rikka cards are basically just ensuring you can get the cards you want into your hand or on the field. Use them as and when you deem necessary.  Finally, mirror force, i like running mirror force because the defence / attack of some of the Rikka cards cant compete against some decks like Salamangreat or Sky strikers for example.  Backup plan:  If your opponent seems to be dominating you, i have included in the extra deck Fairy Knight Ingunar, special summon this to clear the board and start over. Gives you a little time to get your cards together again to start special summoning.  Now, you are probably wondering why i never mention Synchro summoning. Well, its simple, you probably wont need too. The synchro monsters in the extra deck are only there if i desperately need them or i have nothing else to summon. The chances of this happening are low but if you do need to synchro summon save your ""effect veiler"" for that moment as its your only opportunity to synchro summon. At best, synchro summon Queen of thorns as you can easily lower your opponents life points with this card as your deck is only made out of plant monsters."

Amongst the viral outbreaks and political unrest, I and several others have found security, entertainment, and catharsis in the form of these ""VTuber"" lassies that've been popping up all year. Seems I too have fallen into that rabbit hole and shall forever tumble into the paradises of precious dogs, sharks, grim reapers, or whatever semi-fictional friends tend to grace the interwebs.  So how fitting was it that Konami happened to release an archetype revolving around them? Debuting in Genesis Impact opposite side of various magician retrains and the umpteenth strategy that can benefit from Cyber Emergency and inevitably make CDI, the adorable and equally as hard to type out on keyboard ""Live☆Twins"" are quite the pair. And with them, a super-secret agenda. When the sun goes down, they ditch the cartoonish personas and don their true colors, the ""Evil★Twins"". Now tell me that wasn't clever making the first word reversed to show their real intentions. In any case, when it's time to pilfer some goodies, Ki-sikil and Lil-la tap into the Extra Deck to cause some mayhem together, best exacerbated when they're both on the field upon summon.  But they don't do it alone, no no. The fact that the ""Lives"" have the stat line they do (Level 2 and Cyberse) means they can call upon some familiar friends that've been helping out Cyberse sillies like Code Talkers since the dawn of Link Summoning. This opens up a whole new world of options that extend far beyond cute characters playing games for laughs and such.  So with that, I give you what's possibly one of my favorite ""bite back if your opponent tries anything nasty"" decks other than Time Thieves, the Live☆/Evil★Twins.  As with my previous decklist, I'll opt to go in order of archetypes and their main cards to fully understand their roles and rewards if everything goes off without a hitch.  &nbsp; <h1>Live☆Twins</h1> Complete with cutesy artwork reminiscent of Panty and Stocking and lots of terminology that will hopefully be properly localized to creative effect, the Live☆Twins are undoubtedly your play starters and take center stage when setting up. More often than not, you'll want to normal summon one of the two Main Deck Live☆'s, first and foremost. That's when their friends step in and the fun really starts. <ul>  	<li>With twin tails and an outfit that belongs in an early 2000's Sega game, <span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Ki-sikil"">Live☆Twin Ki-sikil</a></span> is here to spread smiles they way I do peanut butter on toast. When she's Normal or Special Summoned as the only monster on your field, she calls upon her counterpart, Lil-la from hand or deck. Alternatively, she grants you 500 LP whenever your opponent declares an attack. But as you can likely tell going forward, it and the other secondary effects of the Main Deck Live☆'s are what you're really going to focus on.</li>  	<li>Ki-sikil's sailor dress-wearing, bread-misplacing, and complementary-colored companion is <span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la"">Live☆Twin Lil-la</a></span>. Summoning her as your sole monster, much like our previous member, allows her to bring out Ki-sikil from hand or deck much like the pinkie. Her other effect that requires your opponent to pay a 500 LP toll for attacks really isn't worthwhile either, but hopefully our next member will tie up some loose ends.</li>  	<li>A spooky re-skin, <a data-name=""Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat""><span>Live☆Twin Lil-la</span> <span>Treat</span></a> is a freebie summon provided you have a Ki-sikil on your field. Despite its Zombie typing, you're more than able to use it for your Link summons involving what you normally would for Lil-la and the like. Though if you ask me, you might want to save one of these on the field for an upcoming Trap card that can come in a surprising, unconventional pinch.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <ul>  	<li>For backrow, rounding us off is <span><a data-name=""Live☆Twin Home"">Live☆Twin Home</a></span>. It's moreso your emergency button if you've no other way to go into Ki-sikil or Lil-la from deck at present, though it requires a discard for cost and locks your Extra Deck summons for the remainder of the turn into the Twins' sinister counterparts. Still though, it can get the job done when you need.</li>  	<li>And possibly the best segue into the upcoming section of this profile is <span><a data-name=""Secret Password"">Secret Password</a></span>. It lets you add any Live☆Twin or Evil★Twin backrow card from deck to hand. Alternatively, if you happen to have a Ki-sikil and Lil-la on your field, it grants you the additional option of a Main Deck beater that gives itself extra stacks and offers non-targeting, non-destruction equalization. But as Mickey Mouse once famously said, ""That's a surprise tool that'll help us later.""</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h1>Evil★Twin</h1> Ki-sikil and Lil-la's nighttime gig takes center stage once they're all set up and ready to go into their extensive arsenal of blue friends from the Extra Deck. That's when they reveal their true intentions and selves, the Evil★Twins. On the surface, they may seem underwhelming, but that's where all their supportive tools come in. For now though, I'd be more than happy to describe both these pretty pilferers. It should be noted that any and all kinds of monsters can be used for their summons, provided their second material has Ki-sikil and Lil-la in the name. <ul>  	<li>No longer a pretty pink princess, <span><a data-name=""Evil★Twin Ki-sikil"">Evil★Twin Ki-sikil</a></span> has gems in her eyes and domination on her mind. When she hits the field while your Lil-la monster is out and about as well, she allows you to draw a card for free. Alternatively, her Quick Effect lets you summon any Lil-la monster from your GY so long as you have none on your field, yet locks you into Fiends from the Extra Deck for the turn's remainder. This is the one you'll want to have out during your opponent's turn at all times, with this next member in the GY...</li>  	<li>Back to bite as hard as her mascot, <span><a data-name=""Evil★Twin Lil-la"">Evil★Twin Lil-la</a></span> is capable of summoning her pink friend from the GY if one of her naming is absent from your field much like the previous pinkie. But more often than not, she's the one you want to bring out with Evil Ki-sikil's effect during your opponent's turn. As soon as she hits the field then, she pops any card on the field, face-down or face-up. It's practically a free disruption, and it actually is in-theme with another powerful upcoming Link monster.</li>  	<li>Rarely popping up but typically helping clean up games when they do, the Main Deck titan <a data-name=""Evil★Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la"">Evil★Twins <span>Ki-sikil</span> &amp; <span>Lil-la</span></a> have one last bone to pick with your opponent before their heist sees its conclusion. They summon themselves from hand or GY by tributing two of your Link monsters, and should they come up while your opponent has three or more cards, they render all but two of them over and done with. Not only that, but if you're clear to attack for game with them, they can strike with a whopping 4400 ATK provided you have a Ki-sikil and Lil-la in the grave. High attack might not mean too much nowadays, but hey. Why not? Also, I haven't read anything confirming or denying it, but these two poser performers are likely a cute criminal couple, and I've nothing but support for it.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <ul>  	<li>Packing a surprise for your opponent in your backrow and searchable with Secret Password is <span><a data-name=""Evil★Twin Present"">Evil★Twin Present</a></span>. It's more or less a tribal, chainable Creature Swap if you have both the twins up on your side of the field. By swapping control of one of your Ki-sikil or Lil-la's with one of your opponent's tools, you can opt for a non-destruction disruption for their setup that can leave them with something potentially weak and useless, like Live Ki-sikil or Lil-la Treat. Alternatively, it can also shuffle an opponent's set backrow into the deck if you'd prefer that. But I mostly prefer the former effect due to a Quick Effect-bearing Link helper's effect that's more than worthwhile.</li> </ul> <h1>Main Deck Mainstays</h1> The Live☆Twins tend to look forward to a good bit of assistance from Main Deck stuff that complements their game plan and gets extra material on the board so their helpful Links can take their place. So while those cuties are off goofing around for views, let's view the ones who help them behind the scenes. <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Backup Secretary"">Backup Secretary</a></span>, essentially the A-Chan of the two stars of the show, benefits from her clients being Cyberse by summoning herself from the hand for free if one of them happens to be on the field. Though it's a hard once-per-turn, she more than comes in handy for getting extra generic material for your summons out of the way.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Cyberse Converter"">Cyberse Converter</a> is like the Performage Hat Tricker for Cyberse monsters, summoning himself for free if your field has nothing but, well, Cyberse monsters. I wouldn't say he'll be brought out too often, but that's not to say his utility in the deck is absent. Play what you like, how you like as I say.</li>  	<li>Particularly useful during your later turns, <a data-name=""Cyberse Gadget"">Cyberse Gadget</a> revives a L2 or lower monster of choice from your GY at the cost of that monster's effects. Not only does it bring out your Main Deck Live☆Twins again, but using it for a Link after it's done its job gets you a free token much like some other useful cards here that you can use for yet more summons. I swear, Cyberse is up there with Warrior and Dragon for most supported Types in the game.</li>  	<li>A card that's thankfully a Common and useful regardless of what Link or Xyz deck you may be playing that you can find room for it in, <span><a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a></span> brings itself out from the hand should you Link summon to a zone your Link monster points to. Immediately after that, it can halve its entire stat line to bring out another one of itself from deck to extend your plays. Try it out with the first two spots on the upcoming generic Link section, it'll be a blast.</li> </ul>  <hr />  <ul>  	<li>With all the low-level Cyberse monsters that you'll be using to round off your games, it goes without saying that <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> comes in great handy. Thankfully more common than ever, it nets you a Level 4 or lower Cyberse monster from deck, including your Live☆Twins though is a hard once-per-turn. Sadly Parallel eXceed is exempt from this card's searching capabilities, but it's quite alright since there are other ways to see your setups through.</li>  	<li>Nothing says ""instant free LINK-1 material"" quite like <a data-name=""One-Time Passcode"">One-Time Passcode</a>. Its activation gives you a L4 Cyberse token that can be used for, well, LINK-1's or whatever your Extra Deck calls for next. Not too much to say, though you're more than welcome to swap this out for something else if it's not quite your cup of tea.</li>  	<li>With this deck, there are backrow cards and powerful summons you do NOT want to be on the receiving end of. So for the time being until this archetype probably gets a tribal Counter Trap the way Time Thieves did, <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> will be filling in that void just fine. The cost of half your LP for the protection of your field may sound scary, but keep in mind that these days, the only Life Point that really matters is your last one. So a generic, practically risk-free way to say ""No"" to your opponent's attempts to be a meanie is always welcome.</li>  	<li>To keep your materials and other such important monsters going after they've already been dispatched by your opponent, cards like <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> and <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> are plenty worthwhile if you can squeeze in the space.</li>  	<li>Pot of Avarice sees play here in case you need to restock your respective decks with their important tools that have hit the grave, and a net of two draws. You likely won't be using it too often despite its Unlimited status it's gotten in recent months, but it's still alright to have on standby when you need.</li> </ul> <h1>Extra Deck Mainstays</h1> Comprising your bread and butter setups will be these guys, thanks to the stat lines of most of your Cyberse monsters and the Live☆Twins themselves. <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> and <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> both go hand-in-hand, hence why you're going to want to summon one and then the other once you can snag the chance to get some low-level Cyberse monsters on the field. The former tributes the latter to let you replace a card from your hand with one from your deck, and the latter upon being tributed brings out two tokens you can immediately use for another Link summon, although at the cost of your access to anything higher than a LINK-2 for the rest of the turn. But that's quite alright, because that effect is mitigated by the upcoming entry that's perfect for summoning immediately after.</li>  	<li>Also blessed by her newfound lower rarity and the ability to be brought out using solely tokens or Main Deck monsters, <span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span>'s utility cannot be understated. During your opponent's Main Phase, she tags herself and other monsters on your field out for another Link monster of choice from your Extra Deck, with the added benefit of being immune to card effect destruction. The way I typically like to go about it is either using a spare Lil-la monster on field with her for the Link Summon, or an opponent's monster I snatched with Present to further add insult to injury in a way. You can pilot her how you like in this regard, but I like to think this sly method's just oh-so satisfying.</li>  	<li>The fellow Fiends, <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a></span>, and <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a></span> don't mind Evil Ki-sikil or Lil-la's restriction at all, and are more than happy to lend their support. They each pitch a card from hand to shuffle a card on field into the deck, pop a backrow card, or pop a Special Summoned monster in the Main zone respectively, with the added benefit of drawing a card if they were co-linked in the process. Masquerena complements these cards perfectly, as a way of chainable removal during your opponent's turn as it's always been. Not to mention Phoenix and Cerberus can protect all your co-linked monsters just like the next entry.</li>  	<li>Finally, a beefy Cyberse Link monster to join the roster. <a data-name=""Transcode Talker"">Transcode Talker</a> can be summoned with either Masquerena during your opponent's turn or using whatever you happen to have on field in reserve during yours, whichever you like. His arrows pointing up and to his right-hand side work for his effect well, as whatever's co-linked to him gains 500 ATK and can't be targeted by your opponent's card effects. So just by being there, your Ki-sikil, Lil-la, or any of your other beneficial Link monsters can stick it to your opponent's targeting disruptions. Not only that, but he can also revive a LINK-3 or lower Cyberse Link from your GY during your turn, including Masquerena! Though you'll want to be a little careful, because you can only summon Cyberse monsters before and after you use this effect. Still though, he's pretty dang helpful when the moment calls for him. Like the teeniest bit of coriander in a curry.</li>  	<li>You likely won't bring out <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> too much, but he's definitely got his uses. He revives a Main Deck Cyberse monster in Defense, but only locks you into Cyberse monsters for the rest of the turn. If you're starving for options, he's good to go into and then advance to higher stuff afterwards.</li>  	<li>Now for a big, big, terrifying Fiend that Ki-sikil and Lil-la have been lucky to tame. <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a> which should have been the name for Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon is undoubtedly a huge asset to the deck once you've got the materials for him. Card gets destroyed by battle? He can pop a card of choice. Card gets destroyed by another effect? He's there for that as well! The turn's over? You uh, likely get the point. Three stacks are pretty crazy for an ATK value, and his ability to pop another card right after Evil Lil-la, Phoenix, or Cerberus do is pretty dang helpful if you ask me. It's up to you whether you want to summon him to a linked zone or the Extra Monster zone, but either way he gets the job done.</li>  	<li>As far as the remaining slots, feel free to play whatever other Links you like. <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> the only Salamangreat monster I respect for chainable protection, <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> for late-game cleanups (even if Accesscode is basically the new Borrelsword that'll rattle your wallet even harder), or any other generic helpers you see fit.</li> </ul> So, them's the cards and what they do for the deck. But before I close out this article, much like last time, I wanna provide some helpful tips for play that I've learned from experience that'll take your setups and actions as far as they can go.  <hr />  <h1>Handy Play Notes</h1> <ul>  	<li>90% of the time, your first order of business will be to Normal Summon either <span>Live☆Twin Ki-sikil</span> or <span>Live☆Twin Lil-la</span> from hand, then bring out the other from deck. That's when you either bring out a <span>Lil-la</span> <span>Treat</span> or <span>Backup Secretary</span> from hand, or Link the Ki-sikil into a <span>Link Disciple</span> while <span>Parallel eXceed</span> is in your hand ready to go to the empty zone Disciple is pointing to in order to be made into Devotee in the same zone. After the tokens from the two LINK-1's hit the field, it's time to make an <span>I:P Masquerena</span> in the zone Disciple's pointing to and then make an <span>Evil★Twin Lil-la</span>, or bring out the Lil-la first and then the Masquerena to the zone the blue demolition expert points to. Only after that can you use Evil Lil-la to revive Live Ki-sikil from GY, then use both it and Evil Lil-la to make <span>Evil★Twin Ki-sikil</span>. If you can afterwards, use her effect to revive either a Live Lil-la or Lil-la Treat from GY to use as either material for Masquerena to Link with during your opponent's turn, ammo for <span>Evil★Twin Present</span>, or the latter and then the former. THAT'S when you're open to use Evil Ki-sikil during your opponent's turn to revive Evil Lil-la from GY to get popping. It might be a lot to keep track of especially for a single bullet point, but practice makes perfect.</li>  	<li>As previously mentioned, <span>Live☆Twin Home</span> is really only used as your emergency button if you've been exhausted of ways to get Ki-sikil and Lil-la from the Main Deck to the field during your setups. So try and use Secret Password in that moment to aim for either of the mascots for the deck. Or, if that's not the issue, use Secret Password to instead look for <span>Evil★Twin Present <span>to allow that unconventional, non-destruction disruption to run amok.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>I:P Masquerena</span>, as previously stated, is your gateway to chainable disruption and interaction that would normally only be available during your turn. The Knightmare monsters she can bring out are proof of that, but so can Transcode Talker if your opponent wants to get trigger-happy with his targets on your monsters like Evil Ki-sikil and Lil-la. And since she's a Quick Effect, if your opponent tries to target or destroy any of your important material monsters during their turn, including Masquerena, that's the time to use her effect to go into a new Link and make them pay for their attempts to put you on ice.</li> </ul>  <hr />  And that's about it for these idols turned idol-snatchers. That's uh, two different kinds of idols if it wasn't clear enough. Anyways, it's a fun deck that's got a lot of room to grow, but in a positive way. Can't say for certain whether or not meta relevancy is in its future, but that's really not an issue for me or other similar strategies at all. So if you're looking to play something with an Extra Deck that's completely blue but are afraid of the lasting mental impact today's decks could have on you, look no further than a deck like this. And who knows? Maybe someday soon it'll get that future ante-up that Eldlich is getting in Blazing Vortex. Though maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part.  Sorry, am I rambling? Guess I've just been getting really caught up in how quickly I've learned to play and enjoy this cotton candy duo and their friends. And I hope the same for you, as well!"

With Pyro, you can beat a lot of monsters, while also chipping damage. Then, after draining your opponent's resources, summon Over Ro","So this is a fun deck when I'm experimenting stuff for Maximum, and I really love it.  <strong>Deck details</strong>  -Pyro  We have 8 normal Pyro monsters, mainly for Gockboot and Masked Gockboot's effects. By sending a card from the top of your deck, Gockboot grants all Pyro you control 100 ATK per each Normal Monster in GY. Masked Gockboot can send a Normal Pyro to the GY, then deal 1000 damage to your opponent and draw 1 card!  Gockboot allows you to easily clap most monsters in the current format (You might need more for Blue-Eyes, though), and Masked Gockboot allows you to burn your opponent, while also maintaining the card advantage.  We also have a spell, Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Red Hot, for our Pyros. It boosts a Pyro by 300 ATK and let it pierces this turn. This is HUGE, because it brings your Gockboots to at least 2500 ATK, and piercing is another great way to chip your opponent's LP.  -Fiend Package  This is an engine that I use, mostly focus on King's Dignity. It's a powerful trap that negates an attack, just by shuffling a Normal Level 1 Fiend monster from your GY to your Deck. Its really useful to protect your Pyro bosses from attacks, recycling a fodder, or just as simple as block a direct attack. Groupie and Goat are also Normies, so they help Gockboot too!  -Generic cards  Hammer Crush: S/T remover  Spirit Shackles: Reduce ATK, protect your boss or minimize the damage  Trap Hole: This card is great, no cap.  -MAXIMUM  This is our plan B, if our Pyros don't end your opponent yet. Over Road is an OTK machine, that if you use it at the right time, you could finish your opponent's hopes and dreams in just 1 attack!  [L]'s effect is the main effect that can boost this card to absurd ATK value. If you use this when your LP are very low, this card can be devastating!  [R]'s effect is the support effect. It boosts Over Road by the Level of an opponent's monster x 200. Good effect for the OTK!  As for now, Maximums can't be destroyed by traps, so don't worry about Dark Liberation or Offensive Counterstrike. Milk your opponent's resources with Pyros, then perform your winning move with Over Road!  <strong>Matchups:</strong>  Spellcasters  In game 1, it may be best to defend using Spirit Shackles and King's Dignity. Most Spellcasters don't have high ATK values to threaten you, so you can simply avoid attacking till you draw your Over Road. It might be hard to bait Dark Lib out, because your Pyro bosses have 0 DEF, but you can try to snipe with Hammer Crush, or just wait till Over Road.  Side deck options: Whispering Fairy (shuffle Spellcasters in opponent's GY), Defensive Dragon Mage (protect your monster from Dark Lib by sending a Spellcaster. In this case it will be Whispering Fairy or another copy of itself), Simoom of the Genie + Groupie (6 Fiends should help you trigger Genie to bounce stuff easier)  Dragons:  This is a hard matchup, because most Pyros' base ATK is too low against Dragon bosses (they usually have at least 2k4). Shocklead is also another out to our boss monster, so our best bet is, of course, Maximum. Try to use your Gockboots to destroy as many Dragon bosses as possible, though, because just setting alone won't be enough against Dragears. You most likely will have low LP after the assault, so your Over Road will guarantee an OTK.  Not too much to side (in our deck) against Dragons, so you can only depend on your Main Deck  Maximum Cyberse:  This is the newest deck, by the time I'm writing this. Its goal is to turbo out their Maximum Boss, Ygg the Heavenly Dragon Emperor Tree, asap by using -tron monsters. -tron monsters are those that let you dig through your deck quicker for Maximum pieces. Although, they all require Femtron in the GY, and they need no other monsters on their field to trigger their -tron effects.  You only need to avoid attacking Femtron, and always try to leave a monster on your opponent's field to block their effects (Picock Hightron can bypass this, but at that point you should have more resources). If they manage to assemble Ygg though, then its kinda hard to out. Not many things can out a 4k beast, that has Torna-like effect and a free pop each turn, but Over Road can counter Ygg fairly well. King's Dignity is your lifesaver, as it blocks Ygg from attacking, giving you more chances to fight back.  Side deck options: Innocent Lancer (a Pyro monster that pierces), Torna. These monsters can put -tron monsters to a clock, because they can't simply set pass to survive, and most Maximum Cyberse decks don't have another boss monster, making these monsters very threatening!  Fiend:  A tricky deck to face. Its playstyle focuses on Heavymetal, a powerful boss that can pop the monster with the lowest Level on your field and gain its ATK. They have good recursion with Punk, reduction with Death Voice, themed MST, and possibly King's Dignity. They also have a strong card: Epic Demon's Rock, that can nuke all field by sending 2 Fiends when you Normal Summon a monster. It is detectable thought, because your opponent needs to keep at least 2-3 cards in their hand. Fiend can also play Beast Gear World, which can boost their monsters by 300.  Fiend sounds very strong, but our Pyros can always beat them with less requirement (Fiends need to tribute a lv5+ for their effects), and Spirit Shackles is a deadly card as most Fiend decks only play them pure. Also, when Over Road is played, it's likely game over because Royal Demons only affect Level 8 or lower monsters. Overall, a decent matchup for us.  Side deck options: Our main deck can fight it already well, but you can toss in 1-2 Genie if you are scared of Epic Demon's Rock  Mirror (Pyro):  Pyro doesn't have their own Traps yet, so it is the battle of who can sack faster with their Noodles. Our traps can be valuable, as Pyro loves their Normies (which are likely Pyro) in their GY, and Dignity can block an attack towards your Gockboots. If they have Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Heartburn-Inducing Pork Roast Fat though, they can greatly reduce your monster's ATK, including Over Road  Side deck options: Our Main Deck can already handle Pyros well with our traps, and a right-time Over Road can still OTK.  Psychic:  Psychic is like Pyro, both are sacky decks, but Psychic has Dividing Psychic Wall that can boost their monster by 500 ATK. Not too much different from Pyro Mirror then, just be aware of your opponent's LP to avoid triggering unintended Psychic effects.  Chair, Beetle:  These are the same type of deck, but with different bosses. Those decks tend to gather as much 0 ATK / Level 1 monsters (Chair / Beetle), then unveil their bosses at the last minute. However, they are slow decks, so you can bombard them with Gockboots (especially chipping with Masked Gockboot). Red Hot is a great card in this matchup, because it grants your Pyro piercing ability, and add it up with high ATK, you should crush them before they even get to their bosses.  Speaking of bosses, they are deadly if use correctly. Saturn King Beetle, Beetle's boss, can let a monster gains 100 ATK per Level 1 monsters in the GY (usually they pair it with Dragears with its double attack ability, or smack with the Beetle itself). Chair's boss, Dayu, combo with Throne of Darkness can be deadly (at the first glance), because they help Dayu to 4k ATK (and if you combo well with Shield &amp; Sword...6k4 Dayu and 2k5 Throne...) The thing is, at the end of the turn Dayu/Throne are back to 0 ATK, and Beetle goes to 1700 ATK, so they are very prone to any attacks.  Side deck options: Innocent Lancer and Torna. As listed in Maximum Cyberse section, they are useful to punish slow plays from opponent  Cat: Fuck them  <strong>Thoughts</strong>  The secret to use Maximum in the most effective way is combining it with an aggressive deck. Pyro is the perfect deck to chip your opponent away, while also doesn't need brick or need too many core cards. Thanks for reading this, and I hope Rush Duel will be popular and played more soon.  &nbsp;"

I wanted it to work. But having Chaos Gate Sunya being destroyed by a monster effect at the same time you can activate Numeron Chaos Ritual, that's just difficult.  <em>Until now</em>. Using the Unchained baby monsters to pop that Chaos Gate, Numeronius is surprisingly easy to get out! It takes 2 turns to set up, 1 to get out the Chaos Gate and 1 to get out Numeronius, and from there it's a quick kill (hopefully). This deck uses a lot of draw power in terms of Memories, Allure, Desires, and Extravagance in order to reach combo pieces, and from there it just comes down to summoning with the cards you get! You also run some dark hand-interruptions in order to enable Allure and also protect yourself."

It likes to get out Ancient Gear Wyvern to get the search of any Ancient Gear card. It can search out Box and use its effect upon being searched to search Frame, thus gaining more card advantage. And if you have Ancient Gear Fusion and you control an Ancient Gear Golem, you can use monsters from your deck as Fusion material, as long as you use the Golem as material as well. Alternatively, going second with a bunch of monsters plus Power Bond in hand will allow you to potentially summon out a 9,000 ATK Chaos Ancient Gear Giant, and with piercing, attack for game right away. The deck also packs the trio of Terraforming, Metaverse, and Mystic Mine, allowing you to stall for time until you get better cards.

Including potentially getting a fireable monster + spell + trap wipe on your opponent when you activate it  The way the deck works is if you can resolve Stratos, you just generate a massive amount of resources in searches from your cards, and if you drew the searchables in your hand then you can just generate more resources for yourself.  <span><strong>Advice!</strong></span>  If you DON'T draw into Mask Change in your opening hand or from Liquid Soldier, then go for double Sunrise to protect your monsters a LOT more, otherwise your opponent can pick your board apart slightly by attacking.  God tier hero players draw into Faris in their opening hand with Stratos as well. ;)  &nbsp;  I haven't got a play by play of my best way of playing the deck, but if you all really want a video showing you how to play the combo for this deck, I'll make one so you can see. :D  Until then however I CBA to make one, so if you really really need a tutorial of how to play, just ask and I'll make a video of it"

In 2020? Yeah, that happened. In that guy's case, it was effectively just the three Sacred Beast structure decks smashed together. I tried it out, and...wow, a lot better than expected. However, it had some glaring weaknesses. <ol>  	<li>Disrupt that normal summon and you'll scoop.</li>  	<li>Effect Veiler.</li>  	<li>It's a brick house.</li> </ol> So, I figured I'd take a crack at it and see if I could fix those glaring weaknesses. Short version: I couldn't. However, I did add a little more consistency and less risky plays, as well as a few outs to situations that would've bricked the vanilla deck completely.  <strong>PROS: </strong>  You'll raise plenty of eyebrows that you're running a Sacred Beasts deck.  You'll raise more eyebrows if you win.  Not too expensive, and majority of your tech comes from structure decks.  The deck profile is adaptable; need more power output? Add Raviels. Need more control? Swap in a Cerulean Skyfire and another Hamon.  Replacing someone's boss monster with a turtle and then one punching that turtle for an OTK is hilarious.  Extra deck is supplemental, not crucial to your victory. If someone stops your extra deck summons, you still have your win condition.  <strong>CONS:</strong>  Hand traps can absolutely destroy your combos. With Called By The Grave currently at one, if you've already bricked and they hand trap you twice, you're susceptible to an OTK yourself.  Because this is a budget deck list, I've intentionally left out more expensive cards such as Infinite Impermanence, Evenly Matched, and Lightning Storm. As a result, you'll be more vulnerable to these cards. Beware the non-budget player.  Although I've never been shut down by a floodgate, in theory one could disrupt you very badly.  Raviel is your win condition. If you run out of Raviels or otherwise cannot summon one, you have to rely on Hamon or possibly summoning Armityle. Hamon is (relatively) weak and cannot OTK with this deck profile, and Armityle is very rarely a good option. Trilojig is in the same boat; the burn damage is rarely relevant, and he doesn't interact with other cards in the deck all that well.  Deck space is extremely tight. You will very rarely run three copies of anything, as this deck is prone to bricking without versatility. Even then bricks do happen and will cost you the game at least half the time.  No, seriously, <em><strong>Effect Veiler will ruin your day.</strong></em>  <strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong>  If given the choice, go second. If you're stuck going first, your Sacred Beasts are vulnerable to removal, so hopefully you drew a hand trap of your own or some backup searchers. It's debatable what your ideal opening hand would be with this deck. I've modified this deck to be as versatile as possible with whatever hand you get, but ideally you want Raviel Lord of Phantasms, Dark Beckoning Beast, Chaos Summoning Beast, and then you're comfortable with several options depending what you're up against.  Going first, you'll want Called By The Grave or Lost Wind, since this can protect your combo and then help you disrupt your opponent's board. Since deck space is tight, you don't have room for error; think carefully which link in the chain you target. It's not a bad play favoring Hamon over Raviel, since he has high attack that will rarely be run over short of Utopia or a Blue-Eyes boss monster, and this makes a decent fake out for your opponent. If your opponent doesn't know how the deck works, they will likely assume that they're disrupted your win condition significantly. This means they have wasted valuable resources on your decoy, leaving Raviel less competition to punch through.  Going second, you ideally want a Fallen Paradise or a Kaiju; Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, Gameciel, or Radian are all fine. Though Kaiju Slumber has the best results, it is also the easiest to disrupt with a counter trap, but if it goes off you can turtle drop your opponents board, set yourself up with Radian, and then continue play normally. If Kaiju Slumber does get countered....well, at least it didn't hit one of your field or continuous spells. The key goal is to prevent disruption while ensuring you can hit your opponent hard. This deck does poorly against dedicated control, but it can beat over large bodies very easily.  <strong>SHORTHAND TIPS:</strong> <ul>  	<li><em><strong>Fallen Paradise is powerful, but does not make you invincible. It can and will get blasted with Twin Twisters or Mystical Space Typhoon, and usually there is a follow up. Be prepared for that. </strong></em></li>  	<li>Raviel, Lord of Phantasms is your undisputed win condition. It is absolutely imperative that he survives and remains attacking without being disrupted. Your top priority is his attack power, not his tribute or token generation effect. If possible, try to bait your opponent into thinking the opposite.</li>  	<li>Fallen Paradise provides protection and draw power once you have any Sacred Beast out. If possible, prioritize that combo. This is effectively a Pot of Duality without the drawbacks, albeit with more setup.</li>  	<li><em><strong>Don't underestimate Almiraj's ability to protect Raviel.</strong></em> Fallen Paradise can be destroyed, but Almiraj adds another layer of armor. As long as Raviel is on the board and still able to attack, it will eventually bring down your opponent.</li>  	<li>Raviel Shimmering Scraper's attack boost is a quick effect. <em><strong>Remember that you can use this on your opponent's turn and during their battle phase if timed correctly.</strong></em> I've won games when my opponent played a large monster with slightly more attack than Raviel, waited for the opponent to declare their attack, and then used Shimmering Scraper's quick effect to double Raviel's attack and deal a huge blow to the opponent. Sometimes, it wins me the game. Attack boosts are just as defensive as offensive.</li>  	<li><em><strong>Armityle and Trilojig are not your friend and are a last resort. They should never be your goal or win condition.</strong></em><em> </em>Trilojig can only be protected by Mound of the Bound Creator, and provides no advantage other than an unexpected burn on an opponent with low life points. Armityle's 10,000 attack on your turn is a potential OTK...if the attack goes through. Remember, Fallen Paradise only prevents destruction and targeting from cards effects, but not boardwide negates or non-targeting. Your attack can still be negated, which then leaves you with an empty board or a 0 attack monster that is now stuck in attack position. It might not be destroyed by the battle, but <em>you</em> certainly can be.</li>  	<li>Mistake should only be used when absolutely necessary. When well timed, it disrupts your opponent's ability to repair or build their board. When poorly timed or used before your board is properly established, you've disrupted majority of your own deck. <em><strong>You want to draw as much as you search.</strong></em> An ideal board with this deck utilizes a mixture of both. Mistake can be used interchangeably with Hyper Blaze depending on what you're up against.</li>  	<li><strong>Your extra deck is a decoy. </strong>You will not often use it unless the game is already going very bad or very heavily in your favor, and usually it will just be Almiraj to protect your Raviels. However, if your opponent wastes resources disrupting or attacking your extra deck, those resources cannot be spent on preventing your <em>actual</em> win condition. This deck has a lot of weaknesses; mind games are your friend.</li>  	<li>Though the decklist this is based off of won Australia nationals, I would not expect this to become meta any time soon. You could potentially tear up locals, but this deck does not have an answer to Paleozoic Frogs, Salamangreats, Zoodiac AA-Zeus, or any deck with multiple counters in a single turn. To make the most out of this deck, you need to know what you're up against, and a careful disruption followed up by a beefed up Raviel punch is your goal.</li> </ul> And, that's about it. A lot of this deck is trial and error, and I highly recommend you use this against bots or trial games before you dip into locals or higher grade tournaments. I would definitely not recommend more expensive upgrades until you know every trick this deck can throw out and have your plays mapped out at least a turn ahead with every hand. I've left some of the nuance plays out of this, since it really is better learning by experience. This decklist is still very much a first draft and I'm still working it over, but so far I am quite happy with where it landed. <em><strong>I encourage you to comment and post suggestions on ways to alter or improve this deck.</strong></em>  The Sacred Beasts support is a breath of fresh air in the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG, and if Konami sees a positive reaction to vintage archetypes that actually plays well, we might see more older or obscure archetypes become relevant as opposed to casual niche. Either way, enjoy. :)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

If going second you should just try to OTK wtih sunrise or trinity. The core is the 29 cards. The last 11 you can use, even the ROTA isn't essential because opening too many searchers is defienantly a brick. Make the last 11 cards anything that will help you against what you play or up the engine if you are having problems with it. Stratos at 3 and e call at three are both bricks does not help you. Stratos at 2 and e call at 2 have been perfect for me but you could also stratos 1 e call 3, or 3 stratos 1 e call. E call is fine to draw multiple off but multiple stratos is a brick. No solid soilder because imperm or veiler solid kills any plays unless you hard drew the fusion destiny. 1 shadow mist because opening one is terrible, the only downside is if you get called by the grave or dd crowed on shadow mist you definently lose out on a searchable mask change. In this case either run the second mist or play the shining instead of cross sheep to get back the shadow mist. The cross sheep in extra deck is for when you resolve gamma on your turn so you can get something out of the driver and gamma. As well as put gamma and driver into the grave so other gammas drawn are live if you happen to lose your board. Also chalice is a irl replacement for imperm, i dont like veiler because it is dead turn 1, and turn 1 chalice is basically imperm and turn 2 chalice is great to slap on problem monsters and then just attack over it with honest neos or trinity. Feel free to comment with suggestions and question!!!! EDIT : ALSO EVIL HERO ENGINE i do not have but if you do just either cut fusion destiny engine and use evil hero engine which i do not recomend, i would either try to cut some engine cards and add it in or play less hand traps and add it in, maybe cut gamma and cross sheep to add them in, and fill in the blanks."

""Naturia"" is an archetype that consists entirely out of Earth Attribute monsters with various types (but mostly Insect and Plant). From my experience, the ""Naturia"" archetype suffers from a bad reputation due to having some pretty bad cards, but on closer inspection you will find a few solid cards in the bunch that can make for a more than decent deck overall. The goal is to establish your board (preferably during the first turn) to be ready for the opponent taking action, since pretty much all ""Naturia"" cards trigger their effects in reaction to the opponent doing various things.</p> <p>The monster line-up in this deck consists of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cliff"">Naturia Cliff</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"". Both fetch further monsters upon being destroyed or sent to the graveyard, but ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cliff"">Naturia Cliff</a>"" can do the battle searcher strategy of searching copies of itself until the opponent has no more monsters to attack with and then searching some important card, while ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"" increases the monster count on your field by quite an amount and is helpful as tribute for effects, tribute for ""<a data-name=""Naturia Bamboo Shoot"">Naturia Bamboo Shoot</a>"" and simply as more ""Naturia"" monsters for the effect of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Naturia Bamboo Shoot"">Naturia Bamboo Shoot</a>"" locks the opponent from using backrow when summoned by using a ""Naturia"" monster as tribute, which is fairly helpful when you get it off but needs some setup to work while ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" can snatch opposing monsters with 0 DEF and lowers the opposing monster's stats by 300 ATK/DEF per ""Naturia"" monster you control. ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" is therefore immensely important when building your field as it will steal the opposing resources for Link and Synchro summons while also crippling the opposing monster's stats beyond believe when two copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" are available. To make sure that that actually happens, there is ""<a data-name=""Naturia Antjaw"">Naturia Antjaw</a>"" which can summon Level 3 or lower ""Naturia"" monsters whenever the opponent Special Summons (which can be quite a lot to be honest) and therefore can set the entire thing up or via ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"", which can once per turn freely change a Plant/Insect monster against the other type, for example using ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"" to gain ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Naturia Marron"">Naturia Marron</a>"" serves as both a ""Naturia""-specific ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" as well as allowing you to shuffle monsters back into the deck to draw a card, which is helpful both due to the drawn card and allows you to setup ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cliff"">Naturia Cliff</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"" again.</p> <p>Less important but still fairly helpful are the single copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Stinkbug"">Naturia Stinkbug</a>"", which stops the entire Battle Phase by sending itself to the graveyard, ""<a data-name=""Naturia Butterfly"">Naturia Butterfly</a>"", which stops single attacks once per turn but only needs to mill your deck for one card in order to do so, ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sunflower"">Naturia Sunflower</a>"", which is quite costly by asking for two tributes but can stop dangerous board-clears from going through, and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Mantis"">Naturia Mantis</a>"" as a Normal Summon blocker. I also run two copies of ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"", which is useful for Extra Deck plays and will be explained shortly.</p> <p>The backrow features three ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"", both for its summoning and its searching effect when sent to the graveyard, three ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>"", which can trigger the search effect of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" for obvious summoning from the graveyard, one ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" since the draw two is always helpful and you have an easy time filling the graveyard which monsters while also being able to reuse the things you shuffled back due to searching, and one ""<a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a>"", which is helpful overall but extra useful during the first turn since you will probably not Special Summon that early and can further improve your hand. The Trap cards aside from ""<a data-name=""Naturia Sacred Tree"">Naturia Sacred Tree</a>"" are two copies of ""<a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>"" to make the Traps searchable and therefore more available, two ""<a data-name=""Back to the Front"">Back to the Front</a>"", which is very nice in combination with ""<a data-name=""Naturia Antjaw"">Naturia Antjaw</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"" while the drawback of summoning in defense position is actually a bonus in this case, two ""<a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>"" for a little bit more defense and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>"", which can ditch the copies of ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>"" from the Extra Deck and gives you early card destruction when needed.</p> <p>Going into the Extra Deck, there are the ""Naturia"" main stays in form of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Naturia Barkion"">Naturia Barkion</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Landoise"">Naturia Landoise</a>"", all able to interfere with the opposing strategies in one way or another, ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" which is both the well-known field nuke in this deck while also being able to actually use its other effect should you decide to use it, ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" as a alternative to put on ""<a data-name=""Naturia Cherries"">Naturia Cherries</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant</a>"" as a stat-booster, ""<a data-name=""Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable"">Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</a>"" for the usual ""steal a monster"" effect and further searching, and the two ""Knightmares"" in form of ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" to have tools against backrow and monsters respectively.</p> <p>The Fusion line-up is where I actually want to talk about the previously mentioned ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"", who can sent Extra Deck monsters straight to the graveyard. You cannot Special summon them anymore if doing so, but in combination with the two copies of ""<a data-name=""Miracle Synchro Fusion"">Miracle Synchro Fusion</a>"", you are able to access both ""<a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Naturia Gaiastrio"">Naturia Gaiastrio</a>"" with relative ease. ""<a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Dogmatika Maximus</a>"" can also use his effect to ditch the copies of ""<a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>"" for card destruction and the single copy of ""<a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>"" to search a ""<a data-name=""Miracle Synchro Fusion"">Miracle Synchro Fusion</a>"" with a slight delay, giving you a few interactions to play with.</p> <p>I have to admit that I was somewhat biased in terms of ""Naturia"" before I wrote a card analysis about them, mostly due to reading some of their effects and deeming the archetype terrible because of them, but also because parts of the community do the same and preach that opinion like their were facts. Is ""Naturia"" a rogue-worthy deck? No, not by a long shot. But they are also not as terrible as they are made out to be. What I found the most interesting is that they do have a variety of options you can work with and are useable in various decks. I have zero copies of ""<a data-name=""Naturia Mosquito"">Naturia Mosquito</a>"" in the deck, but not because I deem the card bad but because I did not find space for it in my build; a ""<a data-name=""Naturia Mosquito"">Naturia Mosquito</a>"" OTK build is certainly gimmicky, but nowhere near impossible.</p> <p>Overall, I like ""Naturia"" and think that they are a solid archetype to use and play with, with the added bonus that most people do not know what about 90% of the deck does, leading to scenarios in which players stack the board with Special Summons only to be blocked by a single ""<a data-name=""Naturia Fruitfly"">Naturia Fruitfly</a>"".

Now, almost 20 years after, these are the only cards i have left. I know this is not a real playable, too many monsters, few spell and traps, but if you want go back in time and feel like that child again, you can use this deck, you will enjoy it. This is a travel in time, not only a deck, it's also a true story.  EDIT: I decided to add a ""side deck"" removing the worst 10 monsters and balance the deck the best i can. Now it's 40 cards in main and 10 in side which is still part of the deck. This new version is a lot better to play with."

The ""Elementsabers"" are an archetype of Warrior monsters, all featuring effects that have discard costs and the ability to change their own Attribute once they are in the graveyard. They work closely together with the ""Elemental Lords"", which bring powerful effects but can only be summoned if the player has at least five monsters of the respective Attribute in the graveyard. There are also various other monsters that care about the right number of Attributes in the graveyard, some of which I will mention in this decklist.</p> <p>Since I focussed on the ""Elementsaber"" part, I run quite a few of the archetypal monsters: ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Molehu"">Elementsaber Molehu</a>"" is absolutely necessary at three in my opinion and has save me and other players from harm by being a ""<a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a>"" with legs, being able to stop both attacks and certain effects from happening. I also run two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Makani"">Elementsaber Makani</a>"", who is the main searcher, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Malo"">Elementsaber Malo</a>"", who is a ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" on legs and can therefore fill the graveyard quite efficiently, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Aina"">Elementsaber Aina</a>"", who is tasked with reviving members from the graveyard and can even Special Summon ""Elemental Lord"" monsters from the graveyard if they were correctly summoned before, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Lapauila"">Elementsaber Lapauila</a>"", our backrow negate and a very helpful member to have, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Nalu"">Elementsaber Nalu</a>"", who can recover ""Elemental Lords"" that were not correctly summoned from the graveyard for another try but is overall only really useful due to being a Water monster. The lynchpin of the ""Elementsaber"" strategy is ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Lapauila Mana"">Elementsaber Lapauila Mana</a>"", who can technically give your entire board protection from battle destruction, effect destruction and/or protection from being targeted.</p> <p>If you ask yourself how this is supposed to work since all those monsters will drain your hand like crazy, then I can only say that you are correct but we have a solution for this problem: ""<a data-name=""Palace of the Elemental Lords"">Palace of the Elemental Lords</a>"".  This card is both bread and butter of the deck, since it boosts your board by 200 ATK/DEF for every Attribute in your graveyard, can search monsters for the cost of your next Battle Phase, but most importantly allows you to pay one of the effect costs from the deck instead of your hand once per turn. Use that on ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Lapauila Mana"">Elementsaber Lapauila Mana</a>"" and you have a free choice of which two protection effects you want to go live while also setting up your graveyard with monsters that will also further boost the stats of your monsters on the field. For this reason, I run three copies of the Field Spell plus one copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"", one copy of ""<a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a>"" and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Demise of the Land"">Demise of the Land</a>"". You do want that Field Spell, since the deck is very much lackluster without but more than solid with it on the field.</p> <p>Continuing with the ""boss monsters"", I chose to run one of each of the following: ""<a data-name=""Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord"">Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord</a>"" for hand control, ""<a data-name=""Phosphorage the Elemental Lord"">Phosphorage the Elemental Lord</a>"" for another ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" and therefore clearing the field for the beatdown part, ""<a data-name=""Windrose the Elemental Lord"">Windrose the Elemental Lord</a>"" for backrow removal, ""<a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a>"" as a sizeable beater and instant 3+ card destructions, and ""<a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a>"" is the Swiss Army Knife of Yugioh monsters in this deck.</p> <p>Aside from the Field Spell and its various searchers, ""<a data-name=""Change of Heart"">Change of Heart</a>"" can steal opposing monsters both to improve your board and weakening the opposing board, ""<a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>"" works as setup for your graveyard, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" is an obviously revival, ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" against the frontrow while a copy of ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" clears the back, ""<a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>"" since it is a Warrior-type deck we are running here, ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" both as card draw and a recover option for certain monsters, ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" to fill the graveyard, as a summoning help for the ""boss monsters"" and a small boost via ""<a data-name=""Palace of the Elemental Lords"">Palace of the Elemental Lords</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>"" mainly to fill the graveyard, ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" as further backrow removal, and finally one copy of ""<a data-name=""Slash Draw"">Slash Draw</a>"" which serves as way to manipulate the graveyard by adding more monsters while shuffling Spells and Traps back into the deck. The only cards in the backrow department I run two copies of are ""<a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>"" since I can get some ""Elementsaber"" monsters back into my hand by simply changing their Attribute (this excludes ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Molehu"">Elementsaber Molehu</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Malo"">Elementsaber Malo</a>"" since their ATK is too high) and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Elemental Training"">Elemental Training</a>"" as another multitool that protects ""<a data-name=""Palace of the Elemental Lords"">Palace of the Elemental Lords</a>"", fetches other ""Elementsabers"" while filling the graveyard and can be blown up to get a sizeable number of monster back into the hand to work with in a pinch.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features various options for board control like ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" to get rid of monsters you cannot destroy, ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" against graveyard-heavy decks, ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" for yet more backrow removal, while ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" features monster removal without being forced into using materials with certain levels. Three of the four Link ""Charmers"" are also present, I only skipped ""Aussa"" since she has no searchable target in the deck with ""<a data-name=""Elementsaber Aina"">Elementsaber Aina</a>"" having too much DEF. Aside from the rest of the options, I want to specifically mention ""<a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a>"", who can use two of the smaller ""Elementsaber"" monsters, boost himself up to sizeable amounts of ATK and fills the graveyard with further cards to work with while doing so.</p> <p>""Elementsabers"" feel like a solid deck to play and to give to beginners, since they are fairly straightforward, overall follow the same principle for their effects and feature two playstyles in both Aggro and Control. They certainly did not live up to the hype they received shortly before being released, but I still feel that the deck, albeit slow, can perform rather well if you have some luck on your side since you will build boards that a good amount of decks and archetypes might struggle with.

This build allows you to either go first or second, although with Eldlich it's good to go first to have full control.  Your ideal turn one setup will be hidden city with Guru on field, fiendess in hand with Scarlet and either Conq or Haq set. Your follow up turn could be used to normal your Fiendess, effect to set Guru then link for Anima to take an opponents monster, then if you used both Conq and Haq, overlay for Pleiades for more disruption, knightmares to further devastate and more and more control.  Your side deck aside from Lightning Storm is designed to go first with access to Numerons, cause we all know how broken Zexal is, and Dragoon for not only negates, but also pops.  Now yes this deck does have its choke points and your opponent probably knows them, but one you have Guru on field, Golden Land traps and Eldlixirs in grave along with golden boy, it can be very hard for your opponent to not only overcome, but also to come back from such devastating interruptions.  I believe this is quite a monster of a deck and you should give it a shot, and if you go against, tread lightly because one wrong step and you will most likely lose.

You can't escape me, I am always watching, I am always haunting your life. But now, before I mercilessly stalk you in your dreams, I present to you: a crappy Evilswarm XYZ deck. It's bad. Why did I make this. <span>Deck guide <span>3x Salamandra- Salamandra is, basically a vanilla in most situations.  All he really is is archetypal XYZ fodder, although late game while you have more XYZ out, you can summon him, use his effect and then push for game. That's the only situation in which he's really of use. </span></span>3x O'lantern- O'Lantern reminds me of a specific Ben Ten alien i can't remember the name of, but that's not important. O'Lantern, like Salamandra, is basically a vanilla on the field. O'Lantern's effect is pretty useless, although at times it can be used to remove problem monsters from the field. This removal is subpar compared to Bahamut's though, so it's only really usable in an emergency situation. 3x Castor- Castor is basically a double summon on legs in the deck, which is very valuable, as the Evilswarm archetype struggles to summon a good amount of monsters. That's all Castor really does, although that single effect is great and allows you to go into a lot of XYZ. 3x Ketos- Most of the time, Ketos is basically a vanilla, as his spell/trap removal is much worse than what you'll have in the side deck. Ketos can out a Mystic Mine or a problem card if it's an emergency and if you have more monsters to go into an XYZ with, though, so that's a plus. 3x Kekyoin- I can't spell his name so this is the best you're getting, an unfunny JoJo reference. Kekyoin's first effect is useless, although his on field effect is great. At the cost of getting rid of useless mosnters, you can recur valuable resources like Castor, and get an additional normal summon. 3x Mandagora- Mandagora serves as a great card for  the archetype, as going second, you can easily special summon it and go into more XYZ. Mandagora is mostly a dead card going first though, although it's too good to side out. 3x Goblindberch- Goblindberch serves to help special summon out more Evilswarms, which is great for such a slow archetype. The only bad part is that it's not actually archetypal. 3x Ash Blossom- the obligatory hand trap, Ash serves to cripple tons of combos and is a obligatory 3 of in every deck. I may or may not own a mat of her. 2x Ghost Ogre- Ghost Ogre serves as valuable monster removal, which is great in this deck, as it can struggle to get over some monsters. 3x Infestation Pandemic- Pandemic serves as monster protection for a turn, which is best when you're first doing all your plays and such to avoid things like Imperm. 3x Double Summon- Double Summon serves to allow you to normal summon twice, going into XYZ much easier. It's another  one of those cards valuable for how it allows you to summon more than the Evilswarms are built to. 3x Xyz Unit- Xyz Unit serves to buff up your XYZ to nice levels of attack and serves as extra detach fodder. I've found it can brick sometimes, so it might be better to run at 2, depending on your adjustments. 3x Terminus- Terminus serves as late to mid game removal, which can cripple your opponetn's chances at a comeback by bouncing various important things that they can't or struggle to re-use back, although at a cost of banishing your own main deck Evilswarm you have to leave on the field for this, as you don't want to use a valuable XYZ. 3x Infection- Infection allows you to unbrick hands by basically tossing out useless cards to add things that are much better like Castor.  The problem is that Infection is basically a slower, archetypal trade in, so you mgiht choose to run at 2 due to how slow it is. <span>The extra deck </span>2x Bahamut is, in my opinion, the best Iswarm XYZ. He's basically a snatch steal on legs with no reprucussions, aside from a discard cost which isn't all that bad. (Some variants of this play a Danger! engine, so if you do, you can turn Bahamut's discard cost for this into a plus with Dangers.) 2x Ophion- Ophion is basically a floodgate on legs, which you can summon if you have excess monsters to make 2 XYZ in order to completely halt the opponent, as this deck doesn't summon anything above 4. It  also searches Infestation spells/traps, although this isn't as great or notable as the floodgate. 2x Ourboros- Ourboros has a steep cost of 3 monsters, which makes it very situational, but it is quite good when you do manage to summon it. It can pop cards, disrupt the grave, and tear cards from your opponent's hand. The hand effect isn't as good because that can just give graveyard setup to some decks, so be wary when using it. The other 2 effects, though, are great. 1x Thanatos- Thanatos is basically a monster with protection, except he needs to detach to have said temporary protection. He's not great, he's just here cuz he's archetypal. 1x Nightmare- Nightmare is basically a book of moon on legs, which isn't as great as the effect of Ophion or Ourboros,which both do much better as interruption. Again, just here cuz it's archetypal. 1x Exciton Knight- Exciton is basically just a worse, but also archetypal Evenly Matched. Against some decks though this can tear through boards, so a well timed Exciton can be quite good. Not that good anymore though, as a Evenly Matched is just better. 3x Nyarla- summon NYarla and win lol 3x Zeus- Zeus is a fantastic rank up option if you manage to attack, as it can clear the entire field and is a nice 3k beater. <span>Playing guide <span>The deck is, fairly simple. You want to get out at least 2 monsters, using cards like Castor, Goblindberch, and Double Summon to get out a good amount of monsters. Then you go into your XYZ, equip it with XYZ unit and do whatever you can. Personally, if you're going second I like going into Bahamut and stealing the opponent's boss monster to interrupt them heavily. If going first, you want to go into Ophion to set up a floodgate to shut down the opponent. As long as you're going second, you can then hit for a bit of damage and go into a Zeus. After that, the game is more so a grind game of slowly setting up more XYZ and then blowing up the board with Zeus. You can also use Nyarla as a fantastic card in general, and you have Ourboros in case you manage to get out 3 monsters. </span></span>Things to note: This is more so geared towards going second, but it can do stuff going first. A tech idea I like a lot is running Mystic Mine with Terra and Demise of the Land, as it can slow down the gamestate a lot to better fit the tempo of Evilswarms. Any feedback is appreciated, like always. Have a good day!"

The deck slowly gains resources from setting monsters until it can OTK the opponent. The Krawlers are underrated and I feel as if the deck needs some spotlight. The deck also has some space to side in hand traps or whatever answers the current meta. Gozen match is a great choice for this deck as the monsters are all earth attribute.  The steps for this deck is to <ol>  	<li>Set 1 or 2 Krawler monsters and set <a data-name=""Lost wind"">Lost wind</a> or other floodgates/Negations. <ol>  	<li>or if you open The Tindangles, you can S.S from your hand or search the deck for a flip monster using <a data-name=""Tindangle jhrelth"">Tindangle jhrelth</a></li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Flip The Krawler Monsters with <a data-name=""World Legacy Pawns"">World Legacy Pawns</a> to interrupt during your opponent's turn.</li>  	<li>S.S from the deck if your opponent removes your faceup Krawler monster</li>  	<li>Stall until enough resources to OTK with <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker </a>or Flooding the field with Krawler monsters.</li> </ol> The bug Spray: <ol>  	<li>The deck can struggle a little bit when the spells and traps are removed but lost wind and galaxy cyclone and lost wind can make up for part of this since it can be milled by <a data-name=""World Legacy Survivors"">World Legacy Survivors</a>. or if removed it can recur itself</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> can also be a problem and mystic mine, but <a data-name=""Galaxy cyclone"">Galaxy cyclone</a> can help bypass these floodgates.</li> </ol> Conclusion:  it is an amazingly fun deck and can even out dragoon and other annoying monsters, Deus X-Krawler is an epic negator where your opponent cannot activate monster effects for the rest of the turn.

It can be tempting to use them to block hits, but getting a Toadally Awesome online to jumpstart the frog engine is worth trading the lifepoints!  Mistar Boy provides valuable attack boost that can end games.  Paleozoic Canadia's effect can stop many combos or prevent them from starting.  Don't shotgun Marella's effect during your opponent's turn. The less information they have, the better.  When using Marella, send the card you least want to draw.  Keep a card in hand for Dinomischus(Traptrick), think carefully about what card you want to discard. My favorite targets are the second pot of extravagance or ronintoadin.  Traptrick represent 2 activation of paleo graveyards effects, since they are trap effects rather than activating a trap card.  Keep track of how many frogs you have in deck, it can be easy to churn through all the frog, but try to keep one dupe in deck for Toadally awesome.

This deck was build with the 2002 ban list at the release of the Phara,"The Strategy of this Deck is quite obivous, beat down your opponent by swarming Jinzo and Mechanicalchaser on the field and use Limiter Removal on them. This deck has the potential to OTK quite easiy. A Jinzo with two Limiter Removal or a Jinzo and Mechanicalchaser with a single LR can easily OTK on an empty field without having to worry about backrow thanks to Jinzo's effect. To facilitate this Strategy we run one copy of Snatch Steal and Change of Heart each. Tribute your opponent's Monster for Jinzo and with two LR it's game over. As you don't want to tribute too much and want to swarm as much as possible you want to maximize on your Premature Burial, as well as one copy of Monster Reborn and one copy of Call of the Haunted to get as many copies of Jinzo from the graveyard on the field as possible. Jinzo can easily be send to the Grave with the two copies of Card Destruction, Painful Choice or Morphing Jar.  Cyber Jar not only gets you out of a tough spot, it also enables you to swarm the field with Mechanicalchaser and even provides tribute fodder in case you can't special summon Jinzo. Mystic Tomato, Sangan and Witch are included as Searches to speed up the process. Magician of Faith can loop important spell cards like Pot of Greed, Monster Reborn or Card Destruction as well as Limiter Removal. The rest of the cards are just powerful staple cards, espacially Imperial order (pre-errata), which you could run at three copies at the initial release of Pharao's Servant. If you want to test this deck with the pre-errata version, you play it in yu-gi-oh legacy of the duelist (not link evolution, the first version) or online on EDOPro"

What a C-C-COMBOOOOOOOOO!","Strat of the deck is to make use of Danger! and Dark World synergies, and since they consist of dark monsters that want to be discarded, it only seemed natural to include a Dark Armed Dragon... or two :D. Overall illegal, but a really good going second deck. I might change it later, it just is really fun to try and see what I can do with illegal combos. Since the deck has so many ways to special summon, it is easy to get Synchro and Xyz monsters on the field. The level 4 Xyz monsters are particularly easy to make with Dark Grepher and Beiige, Vanguard of the Dark World. I love this deck!"

","So here we go, expierementing with a ritual deck. Here's Drytons, with a lot of the pieces taken from Eric Meadow's article. His article was a great help for this, so go check it out: https://ygoprodeck.com/drytron-your-guide-to-the-ritual-monster-galaxy/ Back on topic, this is more so an in depth guide on my deck with a playing guide. <span>Deck list <span>2x Gamma- Gamma is one of the first smaller Drytons, this time capable of reviving Drytons from the gave. This is great for extending plays as you can use Drytons you already used for ritual summons and the like. I opted to run it at 2 because it could be bricky at 3, although some variants can run it at 3. </span></span>2x Alpha- Alpha searches out our ritual monsters, although not just the Drytons, but any ritual. That effect makes it amazing, as it can snatch up any ritual neccesary. I opted to run at 2 for ratio reasons, but in a deck trying to run more regular monsters, Alpha should be run at 3. 1x Beta- Beta recovers cards banished by Draconids and Quadrantis, making it fairly good for recovering resources mid to late game. Although, you want to draw into this card after using their effects, so Beta is best at 1. 1x Delta- Delta, at the cost of revealing a card the opponent will probably already be expecting us to have,  allows us to draw a card. This can be fairly good as long as we get a nice top deck. 1x Zeta- Zeta, as the parralel to Alpha, searches out any ritual spell. Although we're only running 1 ritual spell, this is still a great effect for searching it out. 3x Manju- Manju is the deck's only normal summon, which you'll want to do before you go through the minituare Drytons, as they lock you out of the normal summon for the rest of the turn. Manju gives you a ritual or a spell, basically filling in the gaps of your hand and giving you whatever you need. 3x Dawn Knight- Dawn Knight is a very interesting card in this deck. The core idea of it is to summon Union Carrier, and equip it to Union Carrier, then tribute the Union Carrier for a ritual. Since Dawn Knight was equipped, it'll go to the grave and send a card. It's basically a long winded but still great foolish burial. This combo is quite strong and reliable, although in emergency situations you can normal summon Dawn Knight and tribute him directly for a ritual to get his search. 3x Draconids- Draconids is basically the deck's boss monster, and a fantastic one at that. It's a 4k beater that's easy to get out, since the miniature Dryton's add up to 4k without a problem. It's also able to banish monsters from the grave to send an opponents monster. While it does target, sending it directly to the grave is great, as it dodges tons of destruction effects. Draconids also has monster eff protection, which helps it dodge a lot of the plentiful monster negates and such in the current meta. 2x Quadrantids- Quadrantids is basically a secondary boss monster, as I prefer Draconids to it, but it's still fairly strong. Quadrantids has a Harpie's Feather Duster effect, which doesn't target, making it a great counter to decks like Altergeist (get fucked Doug Dzeef). It also has protection against spells and traps, dodging cards like Imperm. And, on destruction, it specials Dryton's from grave who's attack equal 4000. 1x Brionac- Brionac is the first card of the small Nekroz package. Brionac removes extra deck special summoned monsters, which can clear out problem monsters from the field or draw out negates. It can also discard to search out a Nekroz card in order to fill in the gaps of your current hand. 2x Unicore- Unicore negates all effects of extra deck special summoned monsters on the field, which makes it a fantastic one sided Skill Drain on legs. In addition, it can discard itself to add back a Nekroz from your GY, recovering valuable resources. 2x Trishula- Trishula banishes cards from the opponent's hand, field, and grave, all without targeting, making it a fantastic card for removal. Afterwards, it's just a 27k beater to OTK alongside Draconids. Although, it can also discard itself to protect a Nekroz from an opponent's card, which can help protect something weaker like a Unicore or Brionac. 2x Natasha- Natasha is the only Cyber Angel card in here, as I decided to cut down on the amount of Cyber Angels that were originally chosen in the article, in favor of more splashable Nekroz. Anyway, Natasha's on field effects are very forgettable and not worth mentioning. in the grave, though, she can banish another Natasha to ss herself and take control of an opponent's card with no downsides. This effect is amazing, as it's a Snatch Steal on legs with no downsides. It's easy to get multiple copies of Natasha in the grave, with Dawn Knight, Foolish Burial, and using her as fodder for Ritual summons, so that makes this effect even better. 2x Sauvaris- Sauvaris is a fantastic ritual hand trap that helps to protect your monsters from destruction. While it's rarely summoned, though, it can be summoned going first for a more control oriented style. You can bounce it back to the hand in order to negate a important summon, crippling many combos as long as you know what you're doing. 3x Meteonis- Meteonis is a key card for the deck, as it can summon literally any ritual, not just Drytons. Meteonis also uses monster's attack, not levels, which makes it easier to use cards like Union Carrier for the Dawn Knight combo and such. Meteonis can also recycle itself, by removing 1000 attack from one of your Drytons to bounce it back to your hand. 3x Fafnir- Fafnir is the archetype's obligatory field spell, and one that reminds me of Magical Meltdown somewhat. It adds a Drytron spell upon activation, making it another layer of consistency to get out either Nova or Meteonis. It also adds on another layer of protection for you, making it so ritual spells can't be negated. And, it also allows you to lower the level of monsters by every 1000 attack they have. The last effect, i'm not sure of how to use it, but i'm sure it has a good use in some gimmick. 3x Nova- Nova is another fantastic card for the deck. It allows you to special Dryton's from deck, including the rituals. of course, you'll most likely be wanting to special out the miniature Drytron's, as it allows you to get out more ritual fodder much easier. Although, the only restriction of Nova is that they're destroyed in the end phase. So, you could very well special out a big Quadrantis to get in extra damage, and then you get it's destruction effect in the end phase. 2x Asterism- Asterism is a fairly good piece of monster removal for the deck. You can remove 1000 attack from any Ritual, not just Drytons, to pop an opponent's card. You can easily remove 1000 from one of your worse Nekroz or something less valuable to pop an opponent's boss monster, clearing the board for an OTK alongside Draconid's monster removal. 1x Foolish Burial- Foolish Burial serves as simple graveyard set up, sending either a Natasha for the Snatch Steal eff, or sending whatever minituar Drytron you need to get their SS from grave. 1x Monster Reborn- Monster Reborn is basically insurance as you can revive your rituals and revive the minituare Drytrons to extend plays, getting them out easier than their weird tributing effects. 3x Extrav- Extrav is the deck's main draw power. The extra deck barely matters, aside from Union, so it's just banish fodder. <span>The extra deck <span>3x Apollousa- Apollousa is basically just banish fodder. I don't get why you would summon this, as getting out 4 monster sin this deck is insanely hard, but even if you get out 4 you'd rather use them for a ritual than anything. Just banish it </span></span>3x Union Carrier- Union Carrier combos with Dawn Knight, which I explained earlier, but i'll explain again. Since Dawn Knight sends when it leaves the field, you'll want to summon Union Carrier and equip it with Dawn Knight. Union Carrier is of the perfect attack stat to be tributed for a ritual, so you tribute him off for a ritual. You then get the search of Dawn Knight, since it was equipped, and send either a Natasha or a miniature Drytron. Remember to shuffle your extra deck heavily when using Extrav, so you don't banish all copies of Union Carrier. 1x Linkuriboh- banish 1x Secure Gardna- banish 1x Nyarla- funny XYZ <span>Playing guide <span>After screwing around with this deck, i've come up with somewhat of a strategy. Some of it is taken from the article, but a lot of it is of my own. Basically, you'll first want to normal summon Manju and get off it's search, grabbing whatever you need. Afterwards, you'll  want to use the miniature Drytron's effects to shit them out and get enough out to make tons of Rituals. Then, link-2 into Union Carrier if you have Dawn Knight in hand. Equip the Union Carrier with Dawn Knight, then tribute the Union Carrier along with others for a ritual. That'll get Dawn Knight's search, and you can send either a Natasha if you foolished one earlier or send a miniature Drytron for more combos. Then, simply go into a Nekroz or two to remove as many cards from the opponent's board as possible, and then hit the field with Draconids. Rinse and repeat until you OTK. </span></span>Things to note: The side deck is up to you, although I included the Drytron's trap because it's only really useful going first, to control the opponent's board. You'll want to not use it going second, as it's probably a dead card then. Any suggestions or feedback is appreciated. Thank you, have a good day!"

Overall illegal, but a really good going second deck. I might change it later, it just is really fun to try and see what I can do with illegal combos. Since the deck has so many ways to special summon, it is easy to get Synchro and Xyz monsters on the field. The level 4 Xyz monsters are particularly easy to make with Dark Grepher and Beiige, Vanguard of the Dark World. I love this deck!"

Deck Strengths and Weaknesses</span> <p><span><span><strong>Strengths</strong></span></span></p>  <ul>  	<li><strong><span>Versatility</span></strong></li>  	<li><strong><span>High draw &amp; search power</span></strong></li>  	<li><strong><span>Potential to OTK</span></strong></li>  	<li><strong><span>Ability to lock the board down</span></strong></li> </ul> <p><span><span><strong>Weaknesses</strong></span></span></p>  <ul>  	<li><strong><span>Prone to bricking</span></strong></li>  	<li><strong><span>Very dependent on the Graveyard</span></strong></li>  	<li><strong><span>Reliant on multiple special summons for combos (<a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a> weak)</span></strong></li>  	<li><strong><span>Requires some practice</span></strong></li> </ul> <span>II. Key Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> - This is the main beater of the deck and can be used offensively as well as defensively. Aside from board wiping, he can protect Fairy monsters from targeted effects and also act as a secondary Darklord Contact. This deck more so focuses on summoning him off of Super Polymerization (usually without Morningstar as material) for his protective abilities rather than board wiping.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> - One of the best draw power and setup cards in the deck. Can send itself along with another Darklord card to the graveyard to draw 2 from the deck. Can also copy a Darklord spell or trap in the graveyard as a quick effect for 1,000 LP.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> - This is your main setup card for fusion, link, and xyz summons. Superbia's ability isn't a once per turn effect, so it's always a prime revival target for Darklord Contact, Monster Reborn, and The First Darklord. (Of note: A copied Darklord Contact from the graveyard will not proc Superbia's effect upon revival as the timing will be missed).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> - This card synergizes incredibly well with Super Polymerization since it gives 2/3 material for The First Darklord or a free Starving Venom Fusion Dragon.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> - A very multifaceted fusion card; can be activated during your turn or your opponent's turn since it's a quick-play spell. It does require a discard to activate- so make sure you save a card to discard to the graveyard. Since this deck uses 2 Pot of Desires for additional draw power, Super Polymerization serves as a good safety blanket if either Darklord Uprising or Darklord Morningstar get pitched.</li> </ul> <span>III. Combos</span>  <strong><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> </strong> <ul>  	<li>This combo is essentially the bread and butter of the deck. It requires a bit less setup than the standard Darklord Uprising fusion and it's more <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>-friendly since draw power is really important for this deck. Ideally you want to weed out the possibility of getting Ash Blossomed before attempting this combo. <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> does 2 things: it gives you a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target on your opponent's side of the field and it gives you a free search for a Darklord monster. As long as you can get a 3rd monster on the field (usually by reviving from the graveyard), you can get <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> very easily and then start to revive your monsters again. This combo is centered around The First Darklord's ability to swarm and protect your field rather than board wiping your opponent.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a></strong> <ul>  	<li>This combo is a bit niche, but can be both offensive and defensive. <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> allows you to tribute monsters from the graveyard instead of the field, which can help pave the way for things that can't be special summoned like <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a>. Offensively, it's an additional tribute summon that can bring things like Darklord Morningstar to the field or a second Darklord Superbia/Zerato for rank 8 XYZ plays. This also works around <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> if you have it on the field since this wouldn't be considered a special summon. Defensively, <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> is also able to use it's normal summoning quick effect during your <em>opponent's</em> turn, meaning you could tribute summon <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> from your hand after your opponent finishes summoning their monsters during the main phase. Afterward, you can use Morningstar's ability to swarm Darklords to your side of the field based on the number of effect monsters your opponent controls.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a></strong> <ul>  	<li>This is a pretty well-known combo: you link summon <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a>, use her ability to discard <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> to the grave and add <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> to your hand. During your <em>opponent's</em> turn you quick effect Darklord Uprising from the graveyard (using Darklord Ixchel, Nasten, etc) to fusion summon <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> using <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> from your hand to board wipe your opponent's field.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> &amp; Any Revival Effect</strong> <ul>  	<li>Like I mentioned before, Darklord Superbia's ability to revive an additional fairy from the graveyard <span>is not a once per turn effect</span>. Meaning you can continuously revive it from the graveyard and still proc its effect. The exception is if you copy a Darklord Contact from the graveyard using monsters like Darklord Ixchel or Nasten- as the timing for Superbia's effect would be missed. In terms of this deck, there are 3 ways to revive Superbia for its effect: <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> (from the hand), <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>, and <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>. If you're lucky enough to have access to all 3 of these revival effects in a turn, your board will be well protected with link monsters such as <a data-name=""Apollousa Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa Bow of the Goddess</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a>.</li> </ul> <span>IV. Tips and Tricks</span> <ol>  	<li>If you don't have <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> in hand, try to weed out Ash Blossom as quickly as possible depending on your strategy for the turn. <ol>  	<li>If you're planning to go the Indulged-Super Poly route, use other draw/search cards to bait such as Allure of Darkness or Pot of Desires. Typically you really don't want to get Ash Blossomed on Indulged Darklord.</li>  	<li>If you don't have Super Polymerization in hand, you could bait with Indulged Darklord and use a different combo depending on what you have in hand.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Don't worry about the possibility of pitching <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> or <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> if you need to play Pot of Desires, you're also running 3 copies of <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> for fusion summoning.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Amdusc"">Darklord Amdusc</a> can bring back Darklord Superbia or Zerato to your hand from the graveyard if you need a level 8 monster for Trade-In.</li>  	<li>When looking for monsters to banish for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, usually I'd go with Amdusc, Zerato, or doubles of monsters that are already in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Most Darklords can only be special summoned once per turn, but Darklord Superbia and Indulged/Capricious Darklord are exceptions to this rule. This makes it possible to go into Rank 4 and 8 XYZ plays.</li>  	<li>If you're having trouble deciding whether to play offensive or defensive, <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> allows for more aggressive offensive plays while <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> gives you more opportunities for defensive plays during your opponent's turn.</li>  	<li>Remember that <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> only allows you to fusion summon from the field while <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> allows you fusion summon from your field and hand.</li>  	<li>Watch how you play <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>, it locks both you and your opponent from special summoning.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> is good for spell/trap protection that doesn't specifically target your fairy monsters (ie. Raigeki, spells that search for monsters, Mirror Force, or Dark Hole). <ol>  	<li>Make sure you have a fairy monster in hand to discard to use its negation effect, otherwise it would be better going into Condemned Darklord or Knightmare Phoenix.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <span>V. Addressing Weaknesses </span> <ol>  	<li>The biggest problem with <em>any</em> Darklord deck is bricking. I only run 1 Ash Blossom in this deck because I felt like I was bricking too often on opening hands. Running any non-Darklord card will increase your chance to brick since a lot of Darklord cards require other Darklord cards to work with and start combos; ie. Ixchel needs another Darklord card for her effect to go off, Nasten needs 2 Darklord cards to discard to special summon itself. In a perfect world I'd run zero handtraps (or add more Called by the Graves if it wasn't limited to 1).</li>  	<li>So...the graveyard. If your opponent does anything to hinder your access to the graveyard, then it really puts this deck down. Most- if not all Darklord combos require some degree of revival from the graveyard for fusion or link summoning. Aside from using Allure of Darkness for draw power, you really don't want to see your Darklords getting banished from the graveyard. Also just hope you never get matched up against a <a data-name=""Necrovalley"">Necrovalley</a> deck.</li>  	<li>This should be self explanatory, but you're doing a lot of special summoning to go into your fusion monsters and links. If you notice that your opponent is running <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>, you can either play defensive by setting up a <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Darklord Uprising"">Darklord Uprising</a> combo during your opponent's turn- or stick to the main beaters of your deck without going into your extra deck. <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> and <a data-name=""Darklord Nasten"">Darklord Nasten</a> can definitely hold their own on the field, especially if you have Darklord spells and traps in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>Lastly, this deck will require some practice. You likely won't be using the same combo twice in a row between duels depending on what you have in your opening hand. If you like the thought of thinking up new strategies on the spot and being creative- you'll probably enjoy testing it out.</li> </ol> <span>VI. Side Deck &amp; Other Deck Options</span> <ol>  	<li>In terms of Darklords in my side deck, they're mostly for namesake if I feel like I can extend combos (especially since half of the Darklords can only be special summoned once per turn). <a data-name=""Darklord Tezcatlipoca"">Darklord Tezcatlipoca</a> is the closest thing we have to a Darklord hand trap, but it isn't really worth running it compared to Ash Blossom since it only prevents card destruction. Nergal and Nasten are more niche picks and Capricious is there in case I need to play more defensive. <a data-name=""The Sanctified Darklord"">The Sanctified Darklord</a> is a decent option too if you want to play more defensive.</li>  	<li>I have 3 Ash Blossom in my side deck just in case- though I <em>reaaaaallly</em> don't like using them because they tend to brick hands. I also have 3 Nibiru and 3 <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> for some more added protection just in case the Super Poly strat isn't working.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a> is....reasonable. It can surprise your opponent if they're not expecting it, but you're not really in control of what's summoned by the effect. More often than not you'll end up special summoning Superbia when you want it to be in the graveyard instead. <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> is also a good option if you want to thin your deck down. <a data-name=""Celestial Transformation"">Celestial Transformation</a> is also an option since you're running almost all Fairy monsters, but it could also result in a brick.</li>  	<li>If you feel like it isn't worth running Ash Blossom at all- the best replacement is probably <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> since it's more draw power and it thins your deck down.</li> </ol>"

This deck is still really strong and can still make great boards without Block D","Tips:  If you open with Adhara or Madolche, special summon them first then use your normal summon.  If you have 2 tuners ( and one of them is Analyzer) Always use the tuner for Halq.  If you have Koa'ki Meiru Supplier in hand when you summon Halq, and you used a rock for Halq's summon Special Summon Koa'ki Meiru Supplier and use its effect to add a Koa'ki monster to your hand.  If you open with Doki Doki and 2 Rock Monsters, Summon Doki Doki first and with it's effect and special summon an Adamancipator. (Ex: If you open with 2 Dokis and a Level 4 Rock, discard that Rock and summon Adamancipator Analyzer. Same thing applies to Level 2 Adamancipator's)  If you open with Red-Eyes Fusion it is not the end of the world. When you bring back Plague Spreader from your GY, shuffle Red-Eyes Fusion into your deck.  If your opponent negates your Halq and you have nothing else, Summon Linkross, make 2 Tokens, Link into Linkuriboh with one token, Link both Link monsters off for Verte and Summon Dragoon.  If you open with an Rock Monster and Researcher, Summon the Rock then, summon Researcher.  Adamancipator Risen- Dragite, Should ONLY be summoned if your opponent has already established their board, so you can Evacuate and hopefully send some of their cards back to their hand. I'd rather take Borreload Savage Dragon's Omni negate and 3750 ATK than Dragite's 3000 ATK and Spell Negate  Combo:  1 Adamancipator monsters, 1 Extender, and an Evacuation Target (So basically you need at least 1 tuner, and 2 level 4's for full combo) Summon Adamancipator and Extender (If it is a level 4, the Evacuation target can be any Rock)  Summon Evacuation target, use Evac. target and Extender for Halq.  Halq Summons Plague Spreader.  Use Halq for Linkross, Summon 2 Tokens with Linkross  Use Plague and 1 Token for Metal Marcher  Use Marcher to bring back Plague  Use Marcher and the 2nd Token for Herald  Use Plague Spreader and 1 Token for Metal Marcher  Use Metal Marcher and summon Plague Spreader  Use Metal Marcher and the Other token for Herald.  Use Spreader and Non-Tuner Level 4 for Rapite.  Use Rapite and Evac 1 Rock Monster.  Bring back Plague by Shuffling in a card (Preferably a Rock, and not imperm or ash)  Summon  Borreload using Rapite and Spreader and equip Halq.  use Linkross and the Rock you Evacuated with Rapite and Summon verte.  Use verte and summon Dragoon.  If you cant use the dragoon engine, you'll need an additional Monster If and summon a 4 negate Apollousa.  If you can, follow up with Dragite next turn and return cards back to the hand."

Naturally I turn to my good friend Dark Warrior to help me out with this, Every card integral to this combo was a mistake, please forgive me for my sins.

Secret Village of The Spellcasters should be played in every DM deck tbh. It locks your opponent out of spell cards which is helpful because you see Infernobles and DL use those type of cards to extend combos. No spellbook engine because i don't really have space for that and I want to keep the HTs.

Playing the dragon link package more than ever as well, more consistency making VFD EVERY TURN! Join discord fo","Contents: <ol>  	<li>Introduction</li>  	<li>Combos</li>  	<li>Discussion</li>  	<li>Next deck</li>  	<li>Link to my discord server</li> </ol> 1. Introduction  New version is here with very different version of the combos. Such as getting 2 normal monsters (1 tuner)is basically like a full combo. The deck plays that many extenders that even through nibiru it might even play past that card. This updated version makes calamities with the basic combo which you basically open with every game. 1 more extender can result in a herald and vfd, 2 more extenders can result in a buster vfd and if you get really lucky you can even make the herald, buster and vfd. This deck is really consistent at making vfd though.  2. Combos  Due to my ban on dueling book this is now available at the discord server. Make sure you do have edopro to view the files as it is a ydk file.  3. Discussion  So many of these things might look a bit weird and why I don't play certain things so I will try to go through these as fast as I can.  Why avarice - Well as the only main deck card that I added in may look a bit weird, pot of avarice may need some explanation. For recycling back your resources and getting a good follow up. 1 thing this deck struggles at is the end of a combo, you have used all of your resources once you have finished the combo, it may be hard to get a good follow up for next, especially since 3000 damage doesn't make game.  NO dragon shrine - I tested this card and I didn't like playing it essentially since all it did was set up my monster reborns which painful decision already does that AND gets your normal TUNER to your hand.  4. Next deck  Chaos Dragons (hopefully) 5. Discord  Here is the link to my server:  https://discord.gg/WEUZndTPyg"

Anyways, I decided to build my own draitron deck from scratch and i have to say it's looking pretty good. Onto the explanations!  The main gimmick of draitrons is to special summon themselves from the hand or graveyard by tributing another draitron monster from your hand or field and the effect monsters have varying effects, such as adding ritual monsters or ritual spells, recovery from GY etc. The big boss monsters of the deck are level 12, which may seem confusing, but fear not! Draitron's other gimmick is that they use their attack as factor for ritual summoning rather than levels. And with 2000 atk monsters it normally needs 2 small draitron's for the big chonk. The boss monsters themselves have different applicabilities, one is to counter spell and traps and the other is to counter monsters. Then, we have draitron spells( heheah boi no traps). Nova helps provide with fodder in order to go into more plays, start a play or go for the big bois. Fafnir is there to boost consistency and provide protection ( now dont go around asking why they chose a dragon for the field spells art, I don't have a clue). Meteornis is your ritual spell that can be recovered from the GY via its own effect(best to use the atk reduction on a smaller draitron if possible). Now regarding the rest of the cards: Ash and Ogre you probably know, impermanence is for ez negates, extravagance because the deck doesnt use the extra deck that often( the extra deck consists of outs and plan Bs). Terraforming to add Fafnir, Raigeki and HFD for field wipes and reborn for plays or comeback.  There is no specific combo with draitron's but it is best that your starting hand has Alpha, Zeta and Fafnir or Terraforming.  That is all! Hope you have fun with this deck of mine, because I can totally say that draitrons are my favourite ritual archetype!"

The D/D/D deck is really hard to master so forgive me for any misplays you might notice me do in the replays. You have to think several steps a head, there are so many cards and so many combos you can do that it just gets overwhealming sometimes especially if you aren't used to playing the deck. Essentially the only basic/main combo is to use D/D Swirl Slime to summon D/D/D Flame King Genghis, use Swirl Slime's second effect to summon a D/D from hand, trigger Flame King special summon effect and go for D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh. Everything else extending the combo just basically depends on what cards you drew. The deck is very versatile and has a response to multiple decks. For example main deck D/D Orthros gives you better chance of dealing with Mystic Mine and D/D/D Super Doom King Purple Armageddon can surprise opponent and prevent you from getting OTKed by Numerons. D/D/D Duo Dawn King Kalijuga can get rid of Red-Eys Dark Dragoon and so many other annoying monsters. I think this is a really fun deck but not exactly meta. It can certainly surprise meta players who aren't familiar witht he deck since relatively few actually use D/D/Ds.  Replays: https://youtu.be/CPC8Wx_GB88"

Plus, everything they do is in archetype, so they are completely unaffected by zombie worlds effect! Combining these to decks makes a good midrange at controlling and combo-ing off.</span> <h1>DECK LIST</h1> <h4><span>MONSTERS:</span></h4> 3 <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>: this is pretty self explanatory as it is one of the most important cards in every zombie world deck.  3 <a data-name=""Shiranui solitaire"">Shiranui solitaire</a>: this is also self explanatory as it searches out your uni-zombie which is important.  3 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>: this is the best starter and extender in PK. Definite 3 of.  3 <a data-name=""Mezuki"">Mezuki</a>: your entire deck are zombies. special summoning them from grave is really good.  2 <a data-name=""Necroworld Banshee"">Necroworld Banshee</a>: this is a great card because it gets your Zombie World out easier.  2 <a data-name=""Doomking Balerdroch"">Doomking Balerdroch</a>: this is your main boss monster as it constantly special summons itself from grave if <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a> is up and provides a negate.  2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>: Searches out your PK monsters when banishing from grave. you could run this at 3 but given how tight the deck is I wouldn't recommend  2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>: Same with cloak but with S/Ts. You could run this at 3 but I don't recommend  1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a>: This is handy to dump off an extra PK resource if you need it.  1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>: This is literally just used for extensions, It has no other effects that would benefit in other situations.  1 <a data-name=""Jack-O-Bolan"">Jack-O-Bolan</a>: This card is helpful for grave recovery and that's about it.  1 <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a> and <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: These are your main garnets of the deck. Used in PK combos  1 <a data-name=""Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: This is used to help unbrick the other BA's in the deck for extra consistency  1 <a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>: While not as good as Mezuki, Gozuki is still handy to have on occasion.  1 <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>: this can allow a more synchro variant to the deck because it's a great tuner. There is no Synchro package here because i'm not the big brain boy who can make the ED space like my mom apparently still thinks I am.  1 <a data-name=""Glow-Up Bloom"">Glow-Up Bloom</a>: You need Zombie World on the field one way or another. <h4>SPELLS:</h4> 3 <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a>: you need this card to be live as much as possible.  3 <a data-name=""Book of life"">Book of life</a>: Its good, like really good. Its basically a budget <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a> for Zombie World.  3 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: With Zombie World up you can steal your opponents monsters for Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon.  1 <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</a>: This is <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a> but better in the majority of situations, as you don't have to use it on a monster w/out mats. <h4>TRAPS:</h4> 3 <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>: its EXTREMELY good in this deck, everything are zombies.  2 <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>: the most important trap card the PK engine has to offer, you can bump it up to 3 if you like.  1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>: this card is helpful for making Bardiche. <h3>EXTRA DECK:</h3> 2 <a data-name=""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon"">Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</a>: the entire deck and your opponent's monsters are zombies  2 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"">The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</a>: this card is helpful when setting up your rank 4 going first, and helps break up boards going second  2 <a data-name=""Leviair The Sea Dragon"">Leviair The Sea Dragon</a>: this card is really integral to PK combos to recover the monsters you've banished from grave.  1 <a data-name=""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"">Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>: These are the cards you will have at the end of a PK board. Non OPT monster negates that float Xyz monsters in the process is pretty insane  1 <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</a>: you are running Xyz monsters; therefore, run this card.  1 <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>: this card is here to clean up boards and OTK  1 <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>: removal, what can I say  1 <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>: this is the best card out of the PKs, it's been banned after all.  1 <a data-name=""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>: this card is integral to your PK combos and gets your graff in grave to combo off.  1 <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>: This card is extremely strong when it comes to consistency boosting via draws on grave specials (OPT). It also gives a strong option to essentially Kaiju your opponent for a tribute summon (This effect won't come up often if at all but it's handy to know about it.). And can give you a free target to super poly with easier. <h2>PROS AND CONS</h2> <h4>PROS:</h4> The deck has a good capability of Keeping its ground and playing through a HT or two  The deck provides some easily accessible tuner monsters (one of which being a starter card), allowing you to run a Halq Synchro package if you wanted to.  Speaking of which, This deck is very flexible, you can switch out cards and ratios to your heart's desire, build the deck the way you want to. THIS IS NOT A SET IN STONE LIST, go on, <strong>experiment!</strong> I wanna see what you guys can come up with.  This deck can end on powerful boards when given the opportunity, A fog blade, Bardiche pop, and three Requiem negates is strong. <h4>CONS:</h4> This deck has a larger potency to brick than the more pure builds of either of these decks. The easiest way to fix this is to optimize one or both engines. (I don't know how to do that effectively so i'm just gonna let you do that for me (: )  If you were to buy the all of the cards in this list to play in person, IT'S NOT FINANCIALLY WORTH THE MONEY, Unless you have majority of the cards already, just don't go for it or try to make it as budget as you can (Switch accesscode for borrelsword, change Ice Dragons for a cheap HT like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, etc.)  This deck is <strong>EXTREMELY HARD TO PILOT</strong>, The Phantom Knights alone require you to switch your combo routes on the dime depending on the situation, or else you'll be stuck in a decision paralysis running down the clock that can really make the deck uninviting if you don't know what you're doing, adding the Zombie World stuff just adds another layer of what combo routes to take. You are going to need to playtest a lot to get the hang of what to do in the right situations. (back on the pros, the flexibility of the deck can help ease up this difficulty to pilot.)  (I can't really put a game plan because 1: deck is designed to be tweaked and tinkered with until you make a list you're happy with, which may not go with said game plan I put here and 2: It would be extremely long given to extremely varying situations and routes to take and i'm not really in the mood to write an entire article for game plan alone.)"

Here I am, with yet another horrible horrible horrible idea! What could go wrong?</span>  <span>So, I was messing around with some of the Entity cards, and decided to make a deck with them! Hooray! Unfortunately, this deck utilizes banned cards (Elder Entity Norden and Outer Entity Azathot), and can not be used in competitive play. However, this deck is absolutely perfect for casual games! I've had a blast using this, personally. But, enough about me, and onto...</span>  <span> </span>  <b>The Monsters:</b>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Danger! Mothman!: Mothman here is one of the cards used for level 4 spam, so that you can go into your Outer Entity Nyarla. Danger! monsters are particularly useful for this, as they have an easy (and not once per turn) way to summon themselves for relatively free. As a bonus, you even get to draw a card!</span>  <span> </span>  <span>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing: Coltwing is used for plays with Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, and serves no other purpose in the deck. However, a thing to note is its level, which can be used for XYZ monsters in a pinch.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Danger! Chupacabra!: One of the other Danger! monsters, Chupacabra serves a similar purpose to Mothman for its inclusion, as it is a level 4, and is easy to spam onto the field with the added benefit of drawing a card, potentially letting you go into your combo pieces.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Goblindbergh: Goblindbergh! One of my favorite cards in the game at the moment, this son of a bitch is one of 2 good normal summons in this deck, and lets you summon a monster for free (which will usually be Summoner Monk if you have it. If not, it's alright to use its effect on a Danger! monster or another copy of itself). You'll find yourself going into our lord and savor Nyarla very easily with this card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Summoner Monk: Summoner Monk serves an almost identical purpose to Goblindbergh, letting you summon a level 4 or lower monster. However, this card does not need to be normal summoned for its effect to work, and can summon monsters from your deck instead of just the hand. However, this comes at the cost of discarding a spell card. This and Goblindbergh have situational applications, so be sure to use them at the right momens.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak: Used as the main target for The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche's effect, and is further used for its effect once in the GY to add a Phantom Knights card to your hand.</span>  &nbsp;  1x Steam Synchron: Used to summon Halqifibrax.  &nbsp;  <span>1x Deskbot 001: Used as part of the Halqifibrax package.</span>  <b>The Spells/Traps:</b>  <span>3x Dreamland: No, this isn't the Dreamland a certain pink ball hails from- this is one home to numerous unimaginable horrors! Hooray! This card isn't the greatest- but provides some useful support for your Entity cards. The effects you'll find yourself using the most are the Synchro effect, and the XYZ effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Forbidden Trapezohedron: I actually had no idea this card was a thing before making this deck. There isn't much direct Entity support- this card is actually the only one that lists any Entity cards directly, which is kind of sad when you think about it. I really think there needs to be more Entity support, it's such an awesome archetype.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Instant Fusion: Used to summon Elder Entity Norden. Fun fact: this card's existence is the reason for Norden's unjust ban!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Terraforming: Used to add your Dreamland to hand.</span>  &nbsp;  3x Tuning: Used to search Steam Synchron for your Halqifibrax plays.  &nbsp;  <span>2x Super Polymerization: Super Poly is one of those cards you look at and go ""What the hell were they thinking?"" Maybe if you could react to this card, it wouldn't be as good. But, alas, we do not live in such a world. This card is a good piece of removal, allowing you to get rid of problem cards that would have been impossible to get rid of otherwise.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch: This is one of 2 ways to summon Outer Entity Azathot, the main boss monster of this deck. This can be done during your opponent's turn, and you will be wanting to use your Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon to summon it after using its effect. I don't know of any other DARK rank 4 XYZ monsters that can detach all of their materials easily- and this is the best I could find.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Forbidden Apocrypha: This is one of my favorite cards in the game- due to what it is based on (the Necronomicon). However, in practice, it isn't the greatest. Although it does have some use, and thus is used in the deck.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence: Imperm is a really good staple handtrap. What more do I need to say?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Wonder XYZ: Wonder XYZ functions in a similar manner to The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch, allowing you to get Azathot on your opponent's turn in order to lock your opponent. You'll be targeting your Outer Entity Nyarla with this card, in order to summon it!</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  <span>1x Starving Venom Fusion Dragon: Used as a Super Poly target.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Elder Entity N'tss: Currently, this is one of the more played Fusion monsters in the game, mainly due to Dogmatika's existence. This is one of the better Entity cards, and you'll want to be summoning it if possible. Its effect to special summon is also incredible, but is not as useful due to its difficulty in summoning it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Elder Entity Norden: Your target for Instant Fusion, abuse its effect to special summon from the GY for free as much as possible.</span>  &nbsp;  1x Borreload Savage Dragon: Used as part of the Halq combo, and is the general end result. It serves as a powerful negation and a strong beater.  &nbsp;  <span>1x Old Entity Hastorr: One of the lower end Entity monsters.Although it is useful in some circumstances, it is not recommended to be used over Cthuga.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Old Entity Cthugua: Cthuga is the best Old Entity, and you'll be wanting to use it for its ever so important draw effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Martial Metal Marcher: This card is the key piece in the Halq combo, you'll be using this to revive your Deskbot 001.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Outer Entity Azathot: Azathot is going to definitely be your big summon. It locks the opponent out of effects the turn it is summoned, leading to use with cards such as Wonder XYZ.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon: Summon this card, use effect, and use The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch on your opponent's turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Outer Entity Nyarla: nyarla funny </span> Nyarla is used in order to summon Azathot with Wonder XYZ, or during your turn.  &nbsp;  <span>1x Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon: Part of the Halq combo, link summon this after special summoning Deskbot 001 with Halqifibrax. After summoning the tokens, tribute 3 of them to summon your Coltwing, and then use its effect. The main reason for Coltwing's use is its level, allowing you to go into Savage Dragon easily.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche: Used to search The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Crystron Halqifibrax: The central piece of this deck; use it to get a strong boss monster on the board with relative ease.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Linkross: Used as a potential alternative to the Auroradon+Halqifibrax combo if you want to go into one of your Old Entities.</span>  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  Most cards are put in here for 2 reasons, and I will reply with a letter coordinating with these: A= ""Super Poly Target"", and B = ""Used for ratios""  <span>1x Dinowrestler Pankratops: Good removal.</span>  <span>1x Predaplant Triphyoverutum: A</span>  <span>1x Predaplant Dragostapelia: A</span>  <span>1x Elder Entity N'tss: B</span>  <span>1x Elder Entity Norden: B</span>  <span>1x Mudragon of the Swamp: A</span>  <span>1x Old Entity Hastorr: B</span>  <span>1x Old Entity Cthugua: B</span>  <span>1x Outer Entity Azathot: B</span>  <span>1x Outer Entity Nyarla: B</span>  <span>3x Lightning Storm: Good going second card that can devastate boards if a deck isn't prepared.</span>  <span>1x Upstart Goblin: For more draw power.</span>  <span>1x Super Polymerization: B</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Of course debug/foxy (searchers), Fowl/Spinny/Reclusia/Gazelle (extenders), Coyote/mole/falco (recycle salads/tech/ note: mole is also an extender), racoon is to protect one of your Salads from destruction and gain lp in process also when you destroy your opponents monster it while its in the grave it recycles back to hand.  Spells are self explanatory, traps are disruption but like I said if you don't agree with them remove for more hand traps especially backfire. The extra deck right now is setup to control the board as well as have flood gates/extenders ( transcode/splash mage), take hiita out for update if you feel like it same with zorovoros for Avramax.  Currently I use the same deck in rl except I have Beat Bison in as a tech card."

It's very easy of you add the effect of Divine of the Herald by normal summoning it and send from the extra deck the Herald of the Arc light who will add a ritual card from the deck. I put the Psyframe gamma which will be' summoned by Crystron Halqifibrax that will be' generally link summoned with a lv1 drytron and the diviner of the herald. Union carrier is here to have it equipped with one monster to have it gain 1000 atk and been used to chain the drytron ritual spell or just to equip the dragon buster to Borreload Savage Dragon or to the chaos ruler. Vanity's ruler is the final stop to the opponent. If you did not normal summon diviner of the herald you can normal summon it, preferly by tributing Benten from the field. Enjoy!  &nbsp;  The side deck I will suggest, is this:  &nbsp;  3 Nibiru  3 Droll and lock bird  3 Impermanence  2 Elder entity N'tss  1 The Amorphage ritual  1 Vanity's ruler  1 Harpie feather duster  &nbsp;"

An ideal end board would be able t,"&nbsp;  <span>Hello and welcome to my Drytron Nekroz build! Drytrons are a new archetype that will come out in Genesis Impact this week and this build uses them to their full potential. You never know this may even become meta after the December 2020 banlist! The main goal of this deck is to bring out powerful ritual monsters and interrupt the opponent as much as possible. An ideal end board would be able to end on Unicore at the very least since it counters more of the decks in the metagame right now. Extra deck is not needed for the build put in whatever you like! I recommend having at least some of the knightmares, an OTK card and definitely need 3 heralds. I also decided to add in assembled nightingale (can attack directly) and zeus but that's really your choice. Big Thanks to everyone at YGOPROdeck who helped me make this build! I really appreciate the help! </span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you are interested in an in-depth deck explanation and card choices, I recommend that you watch my youtube video - please like the video and subscribe to the channel, it is an amazing way to support me and the channel.

Instead, you can make a Level 8 Synchro of choice. You are not limited to what is in this decklist. Even if the first effect of <strong>Halq</strong> resolves, nobody said you had to go for <strong>Veiler</strong>. You can summon a <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> instead, as her effect can activate on-field, unlike <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>. But, if you go for <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> instead of <strong>Veiler</strong>, know that you won't be able to summon <strong>Quariongandrax</strong>, you will be stuck with a Level 8 Synchro instead. With a Boat, of course. Unless you play <a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>, which can be summoned in place of <strong>Quandax </strong>which lets you get away with not having to run <strong>Veiler</strong>.  Anyway, moving on from <strong>Halq</strong> for now, let's get into the next play.  <strong>Whitebeard</strong> &amp; <strong>Goldenhair</strong> + <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping"">Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping</a> = <strong>Almiraj </strong>&amp; <a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Lys"">Plunder Patrollship Lys</a> equipped with <a data-name=""Emblem of the Plunder Patroll"">Emblem of the Plunder Patroll</a> + <strong>Redbeard</strong> <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Goldenhair</strong></li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Almiraj</strong></li>  	<li>Discard <strong>Whitebeard</strong>, reviving <strong>Goldenhair</strong> from the GY</li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Whitebeard's</strong> effect, summoning <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Shipshape</strong>, summoning <strong>Lys</strong> using <strong>Goldenhair</strong> and <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Redbeard's</strong> effect, attaching him to <strong>Lys</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Shipshape's</strong> GY effect, equipping <strong>Lys</strong> with <strong>Emblem</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Lys's</strong> effect, summoning the equipped <strong>Redbeard</strong></li> </ol> <strong>Whitebeard</strong> &amp; <strong>Goldenhair</strong> + Any Level 4 Extender = <strong>Blackbeard</strong> &amp; <a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Moerk"">Plunder Patrollship Moerk</a> (equipped with <strong>Redbeard</strong>) <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Goldenhair</strong></li>  	<li>Special Summon Extender</li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Almiraj</strong></li>  	<li>Discard <strong>Whitebeard</strong> to bring back <strong>Goldenhair</strong> from the GY</li>  	<li><strong>Whitebeard's</strong> effect summons a <strong>Redbeard</strong> from deck</li>  	<li>Overlay your extender and your <strong>Goldenhair</strong> into <strong>Moerk</strong></li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Blackbeard</strong> using <strong>Almiraj</strong> and <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Redbeard's</strong> effect, attaching him to <strong>Moerk</strong></li> </ol> Ok, back to <strong>Halq</strong>.  <strong>Whitebeard</strong> &amp; Any Extender + <strong>Emblem</strong> = Any Level 8 Synchro &amp; <strong>Lys</strong> (equipped with <strong>Redbeard</strong>) + <strong>Blackbeard</strong> &amp; Any Boat <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon <strong>Whitebeard</strong></li>  	<li>Special Summon Extender</li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Halq</strong></li>  	<li>Chain Link 1 <strong>Whitebeard</strong>, Chain Link 2 <strong>Halq</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Halq</strong> summons Any LIGHT Monster</li>  	<li><strong>Whitebeard</strong> summons <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Equip <strong>Emblem</strong> to <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Emblem</strong> effect, summon <strong>Lys</strong> (LIGHT Tuner from <strong>Halq</strong>)</li>  	<li>Link Summon <strong>Blackbeard</strong> w/ <strong>Redbeard</strong> &amp; Tuner</li>  	<li><strong>Redbeard</strong> equips to <strong>Lys</strong></li>  	<li>Pass turn</li>  	<li>During the opponent's turn, <strong>Halq</strong> can summon <strong>Quandax</strong>, and <strong>Lys</strong> can summon <strong>Redbeard</strong></li>  	<li>Now, at any point during your opponent's turn in which you wish to activate <strong>Redbeard</strong>, activate him as Chain Link 1</li>  	<li>Activate <strong>Quandax</strong> as Chain Link 2 in response</li>  	<li>Using <strong>Quandax</strong> &amp; <strong>Redbeard</strong>, you can make a Level 8 Synchro of choice &amp; a Boat</li>  	<li>Equip <strong>Redbeard</strong> to <strong>Lys</strong></li> </ol> When it comes to Extenders and Level 8 Synchros, you are not limited to any of the ones in this list. In fact, I may leave these combos here even if I take out some of the pieces; that just means I don't think they're worth playing at the moment. If you think they are worth playing at any given point, go ahead. Oh, and of course, do not run Veiler unless you are going one of the combos above. The card sucks in comparison to other hand traps right now. Now, a little batch of Level 4 WATER Extenders for you to consider: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Silent Angler"">Silent Angler</a>: Can be summoned from hand as long as you control a WATER Monster, but prevents you from summoning any other Monsters from your hand for the rest of the turn. I was playing him until <a data-name=""Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot"">Ravenwing, the Plunder Patroll Pilot</a> was revealed, as now there are too many Monsters conflicting with <strong>Angler's</strong> restriction.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aqua Spirit"">Aqua Spirit</a>: While she may not share the restrictions of <strong>Angler</strong>, she does require set-up, and now with <strong>Ravenwing</strong>, this card is looking even less convincing. An option nonetheless. <a data-name=""Fenrir"">Fenrir </a>follows the same foot but is even harder to bring out, and even harsher on your GY.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""White Stingray"">White Stingray</a>: This card seemed lacking to me at first. We need Plunder names in hand, preferably at all times. However, with <strong>Ravenwing's</strong> ability to bounce Plunders from the GY back to the hand, it looks a bit more convincing. Can't forget the fact that it triggers the Plunder's floating effects.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a>: My favorite extender currently (that isn't a Plunder) Shtana operates differently than the other extenders. While most can or need to be summoned after you put down a Plunder, <strong>Shthana</strong> needs to be put down before anything else, requiring you to control no effect monsters. Meaning it only works on the first turn, and when you're losing. But, like every other extender here, it doesn't have the <strong>Angler</strong> restriction.</li> </ul> <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> has some interesting interactions with the deck. Due to the fact that <strong>Redbeard</strong> does not target, at any point that your opponent has summoned at least 5 monsters, you can activate his effect as Chain Link 1, and then activate <strong>Nibiru's</strong> effect as Chain Link 2. <strong>Nibiru</strong> will tribute everything, summoning a LIGHT token to the opponent's field. <strong>Redbeard's</strong> effect will be able to summon <strong>Lys</strong>, or any other boat if the situation allows, and will then, in a separate chain, activate his second effect, attaching himself to the boat summoned.  One last note. When playing Plunder, it is very easy to miss lethal, as they usually have the power to end games on board, but it isn't smack in your face like other archetypes. The main places you should be looking for power are the 500 from <strong>Emblem </strong>(and the monster it attaches), the 500 to all other Fiend monsters from <strong>Brann</strong>, and the massive boost from <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd"">Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd</a>'s first effect (yes, reading has its benefits). Oh, and if you choose to run him, don't forget the boost from <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>.  And yeah, that's about it. Plunder Patrol is a midrange deck, not a combo deck. If you can make it to turn 3 or 4, the duel is typically in your favor, as you only ramp up from there. Once again, if you have suggestions, I am more than willing to hear them."

This way to combo is future proof if linkross gets banned (maybe elpy too) since you can use the triggering wurm to make garden rose maiden with red rose instead of the tokens of linkross. Sure it would need some tweaks but I think this may be our way to do it in the future. For the last combo with the barrier statue, I should have kept the black garden so I was 100% sure I would be able to summon the barrier statue, but you got the point I guess. You can play dragoon if you want to. Finally, no, phalanx isn't a garnet since you can add dragon ravine instead to send world chalice puppy, basically just pick one or another depending on the scenario.

I find it really fun, but it soffers handtraps too much, as every for fun deck. I play two gladiator beast charge because I have just two of them, but I'd prefer to rate at three both of the traps. I tried even to switch from three ash into three impermanence/judgment, but I found out ash is more useful. Your goal is to have some traps to negate, domitianus/heraclinos and editor. To have them you use andal, link spider, test panter and the rest of the normal gladiator beasts' combo."

I hate it too. <span>Deck guide</span>  3x Shaman- Shaman is basically a field barrier on legs, which helps to protect the main card this deck revolves around, Necrovalley. It also negate's your opponent's field spells, which can help to counteract some key parts of other decks. It also gains defense, although since it's tribute summoned, that's not very important. You have to wait a turn to summon Shaman, making it a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. 2x Chief- Chief is another slow tribute monster, although it's fairly worth the time and resource investment. Chief makes your GY immune to Necrovalley, allowing you to do some other plays with your Gravekeeper's freely and use the PK's to search without problem. Chief also makes it so you can special a Gravekeeper on his summon, recycling various effects and possibly allowing you to go into a Union Carrier for a Buster Lock. 3x Gravekeeper's Commandmant- Commandmant is basically terraforming on a Gravekeeper's body, allowing you to search out Necrovalley without being limited or having a once per turn. You can easily use more Commandement's if the first get's ashed, to eventually dig through your deck to a Necrovalley. 3x Spiritualist- Spiritualist is the deck's fusion spell, but on legs. I'm seeing a pattern here. Anyway, Spiritualist allows you to go into Supernaturalist, AKA big beater with protection, as long as you have Necrovalley out. This deck searches Necrovalley constantly, so getting it won't be a problem. You can get a big beatstick with Supernaturalist in order to push for game after your opponent finds they can't do anything under Necrovalley. 3x Priestess- Priestess is, Necrovalley on legs. As long as Necrovalley isn't on the field, Priestess makes the entire field into Necrovalley, so the opponent still isn't safe even if they manage to negate all your searches or destroy your Necrovalleys. It also gives a minor boost to your Gravekeeper's, although that's not very notable really. 2x Descendant- Descendant is one of the deck's only pieces of card removal. It can tribute another GRavekeeper (aside from itself) to pop an opponent's card, which isn't great, but isn't bad either. It's too slow to justify playing at 3, but not bad enough to justify playing at 1 or 0. 1x Headman- Headman is basically the deck's Monster Reborn on legs, as it revives a level 4 gravekeeper. Note that it's only level 4's, nothing higher or lower, and that it's immune to Necrovalley. So, Headman can be used for either recovering a lost monster, or for a small combo i came up with. You can discard Commandment for it's search, and then get Commandment into the grave by that discard. Activate Necrovalley from the search, and summon Headman. From Headman, you can summon Commandment back. Then you can go into a link-2 Union Carrier and equip the Union Carrier with Buster to lock down both the opponent's grave yard and extra deck, so they're basically just not allowed to play the game. 3x Ash Blossom- Ash Blossom is a staple hand trap in basically every deck now, and for good reason, since it can cripple nearly any  combo. Since this is a control deck, Ash is great, as it doesn't allow the opponent to do any combos they can even attempt under Necrovalley and/or Buster lock. 2x Buster- The other part of the buster lock, along with Union Carrier. Buster equips to Union Carrier by the effect of Carrier to make it so your opponent can't summon from the extra deck, which completely shuts off another core component of the game and cripples a ton of decks like Adamancipators, D-link, etc. Even if they can out this, they have to dedicate resources just to outing it. 1x Cloak- Cloak is the starter of the PK engine, which you either normal to SS Boots or banish from the grave to get it's search. Cloak is generally a searcher and a starter, which is quite solid. 1x Boots- Boots is another part of the PK engine, which special summons itself as long as you control Cloak. These two, along with other cards like Shade Briganade, are essential to summoning Bardiche. Boots is also a searcher, although this time locked into Fog Blades and Briganades. 3x Necrovalley- Necrovalley is the deck's key card, as it completely shuts down the opponent's grave yard. This effect shuts down tons of modern decks, as nearly all decks rely on the graveyard to make plays. Necrovalley also gives a nice boost to Gravekeeper's, although it isn't as important as the graveyard shut-down. 3x Hidden Temple- Hidden Temple is another fantastic floodgate of the deck. As long as you have a Gravekeeper and Necrovalley on the field, which isn't that hard to get for this deck, you can completely shut down any non-Gravekeeper's special summoning. While this locks you out of the Buster Lock and Bardiche, it is completely worth it, as it cripples literally any deck in the game, as all decks rely on special summoning. 3x Throne- Throne is the archetypal ROTA, allowing you to search out any Gravekeeper to fill in the gaps of your hand. It also forces you to normal summon right after you add. I can't tell, though, if that counts as an additional normal summon or if that's your normal summon for the turn. Any help on that end would be appreciated. 3x Field Barrier- Field Barrier is an essential card that you want in your opening hand, as you can't actually search it in this deck, sadly. Having to hard draw it is annoying, but it's still a great card, as it protects the essential card for this deck, Necrovalley. 3x Imperial Tomb- Imperial Tomb allows you to control the tempo of the game as you negate key combo pieces that your opponent try's to use, as you can negate anything they try that  doesn't involve the graveyard. 3x Fog Blade- Fog Blade is a very, very helpful card for this deck. Fog Blade is more so insurance than anything, in a lot of aspects. In case your opponent manages to get out a monster even under all the pressure and floodgates, you can Fog Blade it so they're not even allowed to do shit with their own boss monster. Then ya stall until you can out it. 1x Briganade- Briganade is mainly just fuel for Union Carrier or Bardiche, as it can be activated the turn it's set as long as you have no traps in grave, and you shouldn't have any in a best case scenario. So as long as you open it, it's very helpful for going into Union and/or Bardiche. <span>The extra deck <span>3x Supernaturalist- Supernaturalist is simply more of a big beater with good protection, as using Spiritualist you can go into him, get him to high attack stats, and then poke at the opponent while they struggle to do anything until they eventually lose. </span></span>3x Dragoon- Dragoon is just a target for Reaper, to get out all the opponent's copies of Dragoon in game 2 if i know they're playing Dragoon 3x Union Carrier- Union Carrier actually serves a dual purpose. It can be used for the buster lock, to completely shut off the opponent's extra deck so they're not allowed to play the game. But you can also use it as a target for Reaper, since so many decks like D-link are also playing the Buster lock. 3x Halqifibrax- Halqi is just another target for Reaper in order to cripple D-link and Adamancipator strats. 1x Bardiche- Bardiche is a great control card, as it can send some monsters to the grave in order to set great control cards with Fog Blade directly from the deck. 2x Borreload Savage- literally just another target for Reaper <span>Side deck </span>3x Ghost Reaper- Ghost reaper is just used to get rid of problem cards like Dragoon, Halqi, and etc so the opponent loses combo pieces or their boss monster. This deck doesn't care about it's extra deck too much, so it can easily fill up the extra deck with Reaper targets. 3x Nibiru- Nibiru is another great card when playing against combo decks, as you can easily make a ton of their attempts at playing the game worthless. (This deck is also Nibiru-proof, so that's nice.) 1x Pankratops- Pankratops is basically the deck's only going second card, as it hates going second, but Pankra is a nice card in case you want a pop. 2x Lost Wind- Lost Wind is another control card that can heavily counter stuff like D-link and Adamancipators.  <span>Playing guide</span>  The ideal hand is something involving Field Barrier, a few Necrovalley monsters, and Necrovalley itself. That's a more so simplified hand, really, as with that, you can activate Necro, set up Barrier, and summon your vital Necrovalley's and then control the game from there. You can fusion, pop cards, etc. Although, hands can wildly differ. In the end, the playing guide goes something like this. You'll want to activate Necrovalley, and hopefully activate Field Barrier alongside it if you opened it. Then you'll want to either do one of two things, depending on the hand: summon  a Necro and either fusion or pass, but you can also be even more of a dick. You can use the PK engine and shit to go into Union Carrier, and equip Union Carrier with Buster, completely shutting down the opponent's extra deck. Although, if you didn't open Buster, you can go into Bardiche and set up some strong backrow. After that, you just want to set up your backrow and pass. Then, you control the game's tempo and state until your opponent either quits or gets wittled down to 0 LP by the Necrovalley's. (things to note: Extrav is a nice draw option, I just opted not to play it as I didn't have space. This deck also heavily counters a lot of the current meta, like D-link. And it also dies going second.) Any suggestions are appreciated! Thank you, have a nice day."

By using ultra polymerization to set Benkei's defence to 0, we can burn the opponent for 3500 with reach Soulbreaker activation.  Big Benkei is easily searchable, so we can we just dig through the deck with Saryuja to find an ultra poly.  To get Soulbreaker into the grave, we can discard it from hand using scarecrow or Barricadeborg Blocker. Also, it can be equipped to a monster that is then used as link material. Either by its own effect or by Union Carrier. Finally, Curious can send a copy directly from the deck. Be carful to only send one Soulbreaker Armor to the grave at a time, since it's effect banishes all copies from the grave to activate.  &nbsp;"

Soul Pendulum","This is my favorite and current build on Abyss Actors, coming to you also in a very budget presentation.  This deck is super cheap but super fun to play as and against, seriously you won't regret getting this deck to play casually.  Everything in the build is very standard, some people like running Romantic Terror but I personally don't see the purpose of it, in any build i've seen in youtube nor replay. I'm also running 2 Abysstainment for personal reasons, but you can play the usual 3 or 2 Rise of the Abyss king, 1 opening ceremony, 1 abysstainment  The only weird thing that may shock a lot of people are the Soul Pendulum, but hear me out, this card is really good in this deck. Abyss Actors have very weird scales, unlike other pendulum decks where you see only 2 they have a wide variety of scales that sometimes prevent an optimal pendulum summon. Getting Curtain Riser negated in the scale pretty much leaves the level 7 actors (the best ones IMO) out of the turn. This is where Soul Pendulum comes in, with a handy scale changing effect you turn all the scales into optimal ones, suddenly Curtain Riser can pendulum Superstar and Madonna, and the 8 scales (normally just Comic Relief) can pendulum summon Evil Heel. the 300 boost is actually very relevant since this is a beatdown deck, and the double pendulum effect rarely if ever comes off, but is game ending by itself  The extra deck could be only for show, since you only go for Director and get locked into abyss actors, but turns after the first one can be very explosive with the link 4 and specially with the dark rebellion XYZ, being one of the only outs to dragoon in the deck.  Despite having so harsh restrictions in the summons (all effects that are good lock the turn into the actor bois) this deck has a surprising amount of versatility, with effect varied with each scale and having a very good out-of-almost-everything cards like Rise of the Abyss King and Comic Relief to out problem monsters. If you can't target said monster you can always run it down by battle with Funky Comedian instead. If let the change, Abyss Actors will run you down turn 2 with an OTK  I'm planning to make a more advance construction, with better staples (Nibiru, extrav, imperm), better extra deck and a better side deck as well made to at least reach a rogue status and compete against the meta.  I hope you enjoyed this deck profile!"

In this version(unlike the previous version) the goal is to go into spheres(or Apollousa), raptite, and herald before using the effect of raptite. Last time we went into union carrier spheres and herald but in order to continue from there you would need an extender in hand. Below is the main combo.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/jz8YIUt.jpg"" alt=""The Main Combo"" width=""1903"" height=""1581"" /> <h2>Handtraps</h2> If your opponent plays a handtraped anywhere before the Herald and you cannot get Magna Drago on the field, then 4 monsters on board by using one or more of the extenders (gilasaurus, the phantom knights of shade brigandine, succession, signs etc.). link of those that are not under the extra monster zone into Reprodocus and change the type to dragon. Then go into Elpy and use the other monster and Reprodocus for Protector Welp and continue.  The next Diagram is siding against Nib.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/MNebw7p.jpg"" alt=""Playing Through Nib"" width=""1903"" height=""2545"" /> <h2>Conclusion</h2> These are some examples to utilize this deck. I haven't played enough to see and test scenarios against the meta. There are still some problems i haven't worked out(like many engine pieces, or the lack of an an OTK card in the extra deck to play after turn 1). I will have to test more to find our. Unfortunately the banlist doesn't wait.  &nbsp;"

FUSIONS!  FUSIONS!  This deck is nothing but fusions and what you need to summon them!,"Hey guys, it has been a while since I have made a fun deck to use, and Dueling Nexus is down again so I figured now would be the perfect time to share a deck that I have been experimenting with.  It is composed of 100% fusion monsters and the ingredients necessary to summon them in battle.  I do have to admit that sometimes, some of the fusion monsters feel like the conditions have to be perfect to get them on the field, but when you do, hopefully you will give your opponent a hard time.  I am still working on perfecting this deck, so if you have any suggestions on how to make it better, let me know.  I understand that the deck is 60 cards, but that is just the way that I enjoy making decks.  There are so many good cards out there that it is hard to narrow it down to just 40 or even 50 for that matter.  If that is your suggestion, I am sorry, I already know that this deck will not be as good as the meta decks that we see in competitive play, but that is not why I make decks.  I make them to have fun doing so.  So, without further ado, please enjoy, but don't judge too harshly, and if you like it, feel free to leave a like and comment telling me what you like most about the deck.  &nbsp;  Thanks,  Bmike0787"

Cannot figure out how to make it stronger.  Focus on Su Mou 1st effect to search out Zhuge (unless opponent controls 2 monsters, if so then use Liu Xuan). Extend into xyz if you want (also has a very op link that can pop saga spells to search and summon things, while sending opponents cards back to hand). I wait and decide what to do based on what my opponent is doing, especially if Zhang Yuan is in my hand and a Saga spell on field. Never overextend to show off extra deck, instead react. Pop Saga spells to special summon and search other spells. Changban trap is very op when used strategically.  If 2 Sun Mous are on the field and no other monster. Your opponent cannot target you for attack. If 2 Zhang Yuans are on the field and no other monster neither monster can be destroyed by battle.  More tricks you have to see for yourself.  Very techy. I know it can be used with other archetypes. Have had some success with Windwitch because most of them can be special summoned even after Ice Bell's effect and core cards do not rely on extra deck very much.  Looking at True Draco next because of Sun Mou's effect? idk  Side deck perfect to counter flood gate decks that use gy because you will never use gy with this deck. Necrovalley and imperial wall will have opponents scooping. Play the opponent not the combos."

Beware this deck was created by pulling myself into the state of a 'trash mentality' duelist - spamming synchro monsters and drawing out half your deck. However, in order to appeal to target audiences that don't like this mindset (such as Jobe) I have included cards such as Slifer the Sky Dragon (because its cool, if you're lucky you migth draw it out from the first half of your deck) and DMG. This deck was tested in tags only - so you can replace Ancient leaf with cards in Side like the Spellbook engine but not sure of consistency (currently about 75-85%). End board is also pretty lame... usually you would try and summon Borreload/Crystal Wing and Avramax (during opponents turn with Masqeurena)."

Also, if you have enough resources you can get Soldier of Chaos out easily too if you summon a Buster Blader off of Protector, which doesn't happen a terrible amount of times but enough where it has won me games with. And linking all of those monsters off greatly helps the next turn when you get your Buster Lock on the field."

Than u can make another rank 4 and you still have 2 cards in hand.</li>  	<li>There are 3 waking the dragon on the side deck. After game 1, your opponent probably will side some backrow removal (Twin twisters, Lightning storm, Harpie's feather duster. If you have Waking the Dragon or Trap trick (activate to set Waking the Dragon) set, you basically win the game by summoning Ultimate Falco.</li>  	<li>You can learn more about this deck on Team Bortle's youtube channel, there's a lot of traptrix builds and tips there.</li>  	<li>Extra and Side deck depends on what decks you are playing against on your locals.

I decided to work on this idea today. Because most of the Bonding monsters are all Dinos I decided to add the best Dino monsters I could think of to this deck. I haven't been able to test the deck on Edopro or Duelingbook I don't know whether it will be good or not. I plan on testing the deck soon and once I do I will add in either the comments or this description of how well the deck does. If any of you have any suggestions for the deck I'll be willing to test them out."

""play pendulum and you can’t be beaten""  -Zeekou  &nbsp;  ""when in doubt, just play pend""  -henrystick  &nbsp;  Words of wisdom (in the comments section of a Zoodiac Dogmatika deck, but I digress) that inspired me to post my Pendulum list. The ban list did <strong>nothing</strong>.  Now let me explain why I chose Pendulum Magicians. As of the moment, there is only one other Pendulum archetype worth playing: Endymion. You could even mix the 2. So why don't I play Endymion? <ul>  	<li>Have you read Misc?</li> </ul> Now, imagine a card, just like Misc, but has over twice the card text. Now imagine if there was an entire archetype with card texts that long. Yeah, that's Endymion. Combine it with all playerbase's semi-illiteracy, and you've got a mess in your hands. Here, just look at this: <a data-name=""Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic"">Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic</a>. Children's card game by the way. Just wanted to point that out.  Endymion Player: ""I activate Servant of Endymion, removing 3 spell counters""  Opponent: ""Cool, what does that do?""  Endymion Player: ""It lets me... (Proceeds to explain effect as Opponent sits there regretting asking the question) ... and 1 monster from my Deck""  Opponent: ""Ash""  Endymion Player: *Sigh* ""Yeah that works""  A scenario like that will be happening for the entirety of the duel as if an opponent refuses to read their own cards, how could you expect them to read Endymion? They will sit there listening for exactly the words they want (in this case ""deck"") or just interrupt their opponent saying ""Yeah never mind, I believe you."" <ul>  	<li>BIG BRAIN</li> </ul> When playing Endymion, one does not simply activate <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>. You need to think ""Oh, I should set scales first!"" And then, ""Wait, which scale do I put down first?"" And then, ""Should I use <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> before I set scales, play my field spell, then set scales? Or should I set scales, then search? Or should I search, play scales, then put down my field spell?"" And I could go on and on. it just becomes this mumbo-jumbo of decisions, and even if you decide on a play and start committing to it, you may have to change it midway due to your opponent's pieces of interaction (hand traps and such) or your own random draws off the top (desires, upstart, you get the idea). Combine that with the fact that I still misplay with some of my favorite decks, decks that I've been playing for years, and I will without a doubt butcher the entire game plan and get a tenth of the expected win rate.  So yeah, this is just my Pendulum Magicians list, nothing special, please give me your suggestions in the comments. oh yeah, the side deck are just a bunch of ideas, don't use it as an actual side deck.  Oh yeah, in case you were interested, or just wanted to say something about Pendulum, here's my Zoodiac Dogmatika list: https://ygoprodeck.com/zoodiac-dogmatika-2/  Still waiting Konaim to bring back Pend stuff."

Let me tell you s story of someone who fell into madness over cardboard, and the deck that was his demise. I started this list a couple of months ago as a joke, after man attempts to make it work I couldn't do it, so I did the sane thing and dropped it, however over the next months this became an obsession.  The list you see is the fruit of my labor, my pain, and my suffering.  The Isolde starters: first you run a bunch of warrior that special summon themselves to make Isolde, this part is entirely up to one's preference  Equip spells: run 1x phoenix blade, 4x others with different names, and 3x D.D.R.  The combo pieces: 1x Armageddon knight, 1x plaguespreader zombie, 1x red rose dragon, 1x white rose dragon, 1x zephyros, 2x s'monk, 1x rescue ferret, 1x vylon cube, 1x tuningware, 1x magicat, 1x de-synchro, 1x Hungry Burger, 1x catapult turtle, 1x Hamburger recipe, 3x limiter removal, 1x temple of kings, 1x DNA surgery  The Extra: 1x Isolde, 1x Halq, 1x power tool, 1x   Dugares, 1x n'tss, 1x<span> Alembertian</span>, 1x Draco Masters, 1x Armory Arm, 1x linkross, 1x hyper lib, 1x any level 6 spellcaster synchro, 1x skull dread, and 3x Nyarla because it's funny  the combo is just isolde loops, you can figure out how it works, in essence you draw the entire deck and then kill you opponent with Hungry Burger  &nbsp;"

I added as many extenders as possible to continue your plays after Shiranui Solitaire or Uni-Zombie got hit by hand-traps since one of the main downsides compared to other combo decks is its vulnerability to negating your first normal summon/first send to graveyard effect. Its big strength is the possibility to get some kind of a board with almost any hand, always having some sort of control style with zombie world and Balerdroch and having insane follow up plays after turn 1 thanks to burial from a different dimension and zombie master/Goblinzombie/Mezuki cycling. Furthermore, you can easily side into using super poly and Rivalry because this deck keeps its capability to get Balerdroch and Zombieworld onto the board even with siding out a lot of the combo pieces and extenders."

I have been playing with this deck for awhile now and it is very consistent. ,Cyber Dragon Infinity will be your main boss monster. You will be able to attach one of your opponents attack position monsters as material to Infinity once per turn and you can detach materials to negate once per turn. A great combo with this deck is Cyber Dragon Sieger and Chimeratech Rampage Dragon. Sieger can boost Rampage Dragons attack by 2100 and you can use Rampage Dragon's effect to attack two extra times.

Here’s the overall strategy with this deck: you first need a way to get spell counters on board, as this will lead you to a desirable outcome whether that will be OTK or 6-8 negates on turn one.  If you are wondering the best way to get to those boards, it really just depends on the hand you get. Sometimes it good enough, sometimes it’s barely serviceable, and a lot of times it gives you way more to go off of.  Anyways, Servant is gonna be your primary play maker, SS one of your negates (Jackal or Endymion), link them off into Crowley or Day-Breaker, again, depending on the hand. The Spellbooks are gonna help you a lot with thinning the deck to get to your negates or materials, as well as the Mythical Beasts being a way to get more spell counters on board.  Crowley into Secrets or Spellbook Magician of Prophecy, then go into Knowledge for draw power. Your next move is gonna have to be a way to link off without the need of a pendulum summon. If you have Pot of Desires, Pendulum Call, Duelist Alliance, Spell Power Mastery, Or Allure of Darkness, or any combination of them, go ahead and do your searches and draws to get Magister of Endymion, activate Magister, get Servant, then link off into Selene, use her effect to get Spellbook Magician, then link them off into Apollousa with 2-3 negates. Now is the time to pendulum summon. You can easily get 6-8 negates on board turn one, or manage to get 8000+ damage on board going second if you summon Avramax."

I'm not too sure on Charmers with what their game plan should be or ratios so this is more so a rough draft, any help would be appreciated.  Their main synergy comes with their large variety of attributes, although they do clash a little with the normal summon, but not enough to justify not running them. Also, this takes a lot of cards from the structure deck but also uses a lot of cards from outside sources. <span>Deck guide </span>1x Aussa- I opted to only run 1 because it doesn't do that much shit (it's gained effect is miniscule at best), but Aussa's partner is at 3, so it might be better to bump her up? Not sure. But yeah Aussa's there. 2x Dharc- Dharc , I opted to run at 2 because it actually has a pretty good first effect on SS. It searches out level 3 or 4 spellcasters, which is a ton of the deck. Although, you can only really SS Dharc with 2 Dharcs or 1 of itself and an Aleister, so it's a bit of a pain. But worth it. Also I couldn't figure out which card his partner is so help on that would be appreciated. 1x Eria- Same as Aussa, although I couldn't figure out the name of her partner (What even is it's name?) 1x Hiita- See above, except I did remember the name of her partner. It's in the deck 2x Lyna- Lyna is a solid searcher in the deck, as she gets a search of any Spellcaster with 1500 def (With is all the Charmers) on proper SS. Although I dunno the name of her partner so any help on that would be appreciated lmfao. 1x Wynn- Wynn is, not super useful as her SS effect is useless. She doesn't do much. 2x Inari - Inari is the familiar of Hiita, and is quite solid as it SS's itself as long as you control a spellcaster. It can help swarm the field, although you can only control 1. Generally a solid card and enables a SS of Hiita. It also SS's itself after it's destroyed, so that's nice. 1x Greater Inari- Greater Inari is basically the evolved form of Inari, as it allows you to send Hiita and another Hiita or Inari to special summon it from the hand or deck. Being able to summon it from the deck is fantastic, and very rare. It also has a solid effect to deal burn damage equal to the attack of 1 monster the opponent controls on summon, which can deal 3000-4000 on average. And, when it's removed from the field to the grave, it searches a possessed card, which is really nice to search for later plays. 3x Eater- Eater works similarly to Inari, as it special summons itself with the same restrictions. Although, it's graveyard effect is much better and much less situational than Inari's. During the opponent's end phase, as long as Eater is in the grave, you can pop one of your own monsters to special Eater. This is great, as it props Nefasiour's search (which i'll explain in a moment) and allows you to recur resources. 1x Nefaiserour- I have no idea how to spell it's name, but. Send a generic spellcaster and a Earth and you got the nefarious man. It's not very hard to get out due to the large amount of Eater's and Spellcasters in the deck. Nefaiseror is best to send Eater off of, because then you can SS Nefaisiour from deck and special summon the spellcaster you used for it's summon (you want to keep Eater in the grave). Then after you do your plays and it's the opponent's end phase, you can pop Nefaisioer with Eater to get the search and special Eater so you stay equal in card advantage and are ready to do more plays on your next turn. 3x Aleister- Aleister is one of the key components of the Invocation engine, and quite an interesting card. You can normal summon him to search, but in all actuality you don't always have to normal summon him as long as you have an Invocation in hand.  So he serves as fodder for tons of Invocations and synergizes quite well with the Charmer's, as he's a Spellcaster. He also is technically a hand trap, as he can boost a fusion's attack by 1000 by discarding him, which is fairly nice to beat over problem monsters (but rarely used). 3x Ghost Ogre- Ghost Ogre is much needed monster removal in the deck, as if your opponent tries any funny business you get to pop the funny business monster. While Ogre doesn't negate, it still can out annoying stuff like Borrelsword, Charles, etc. 3x Effect Veiler- The last hand trap, Effect Veiler is just a nice piece of interruption as he stops the opponent from doing much of anything, due to how important monster effects are nowadays. 3x Grand Spirit Art- Ichirin allows you to negate monster effects as long as you (basically) control a Charmer, which is a great effect, although it's a once per turn. It also allows you to reveal a spellcaster to add a monster with 1500 attack and 200 def (AKA one of the familiars) to the hand and shuffle back the revealed monster. The second effect is quite nice for helping to unclog bricked hands. For Ichirin, you want to activate Meltdown first to get it's search/bait out Ash blossoms, then replace the Meltdown with an Ichirin after you do your fusions. 3x Awakening of the Posessed- Awakening of the Possesed gives an attack boost for your monsters as long as you have a good amount of varied attributes (which you should have in this deck), and gives the Charmer's effect destruction protection. And, if you normal/special a Charmer, you can draw 1 card (although it's a hard once per turn). Awakening is great, as it makes up for some of the faults of the Charmers. 3x Master of the Spiritual Arts- the deck's main searcher, Master enables you to search a monster and a backrow, just at the cost of discarding one. The effect is generally solid and helps to get you to your combo pieces, as well as enabling plays. 3x Invocation- Invocation is another one of the Invoked combo pieces, being searched by Aleister. It reaches into literally everything; the hand, graveyard, and field. It also reaches into the opponent's grave, which is fucking fantastic. All this leads into an array of fusions you can go into, all without a hard once per turn. You can also recycle Invocation and Aleister. 3x Magical Meltdown- Meltdown searches Aleister on activation, filling in the gaps of your hand for more fusion plays. It also gives more protection to your fusions on their summons, so they can't be negated. You'll want to activate Meltdown and then, after the search and fuses, replace it with Ichirin (thank god Konami let us do that, they did something smart for once). 2x Unpossed- Unpossesed gives your monsters an attack boost, battle protection, and a field swarming ability to special summon from the deck if they destroy a monster with a different attribute from the monster in the deck they're trying to SS. Unpossessed is generally fantastic, it's just a shame it's so slow, which is why it's at 2 instead of 3. <span>The extra deck <span>1x Borrelsword- Borrelsword is something you can go into sometimes, although not a ton. Don't rely  on it, but it can be a nice surprise for the opponent. </span></span>All 4 of the charmer links- They all do the same thing, so i'm not going to do them all seperately. In certain matchups they can be really helpful to summon them and steal a strong monster from the opponent's grave.  1x Elysium- Elysium serves to be a big boss monster for the Invokeds late game. As long as you have a fusion and the opponent is playing some extra deck stuff, you can use Invocation to get out Elysium. Elysium, on field, is basically a really big beater with monster removal. It also looks like a biblically accurate angel.  1x Mechaba- one of the key Invokeds, Mechaba provides great negates as long as you have a large hand, which is possible with the draw power of and searching of this deck. You  can easily negate things and the such, also banishing cards, the only downside being that Mechaba isn’t a very strong attacker. He can still put work in for an OTK though.  2x Augodies-  Dunno how to spell it’s name, but it’s a cool card. Augodies serves to grow to high attack stat levels late game, as long as you have a good amount of fusions in the grave. It also has a destruction effect to discourage the opponent from special summoning, which is a very important thing in many decks.  2x Purgatrio- Purgatrio is the last key Invoked. Purgatrio heavily punishes swarm decks like Dragonlink, by growing to huge numbers and beating over all of them. He also has really cool art. He’s also easy to get out by using an opponent’s Ash or something like it, due to how heavily used Ash Blossom is.  1x Cocytus- Cocytus is a 28k wall that can attack in defense postion, which basically enables it to whittle down at the opponent slowly. Not a huge fan of Cocytus but eh, he’s there.  2x Raidjin- a fantastic instant fusion target, Raidjin can flip a problem card face down to avoid it, and if it has low defense, easily beat over it.  2x Caliga- Caliga serves as a strong floodgate to heavily counter many decks. Since a lot of the Charmer's have more useless  effects or on summon effects, Caliga's floodgate doesn't hurt us as much as it hurts the opponent in the long run. 1x Utopia- Utopia can be pretty easily overlayed into with a Charmer and their Familiar, although he himself isn't of much use. Rank it into Lightning. 1x Lightning. Lightning is the main out to a lot of problem cards, as after ranking into it from regular Utopia, it can detach materials and go up to 5000 and beat over basically anything. Lightning is really solid in this deck for spot removal, which it can struggle with. <span>Playing guide <span>The deck, isn't super complex or anything. You'll want to activate Meltdown, get your search, and then activate Invocation to fuse away Aleister or normal summon Aleister for his search, to then fuse. You'll want to get out as big of Invokeds as you can, maybe a Mechaba or something for negates, and then go through your Charmer plays (hopefully with your normal summon still available). Like normal, you'll replace Meltdown, search until you have the proper hand, and then  get out the Charmer you want. Then get out the Familar's you need and afterwards, simply play the grind game and wittle down the opponent. </span></span>This deck is a bit of a rough draft, so any help would be appreciated. A tech idea I came up with while working on this is to include a small Danger! engine, to give more fodder for Dharc and to get more monsters on the field, and for a small bit of draw power.  Update: Added in Knowledge and There Can Only Be On, also also Artemis.  There Can Only Be One cripples tons of plays from the opponent, and Knowledge is a nice draw spell. With Artemis, you can normal Aleister, search Invocation, and link off Aleister into Artemis. Then tribute Artemis for the draw of Knowledge, and afterwards, activate Invocation to banish Artemis and Aleister for a Mechaba."

It is a combo deck that is all about setting up a big board of monsters while also having back row cards to reassure that you wont die either when your monsters are destroyed or they have found a way to negate your entire board(cards like dark ruler no more, forbidden droplet etc.). This deck unfortunately is very  expensive and is not a breeze to play due to the fact that you need to be mindful of what you are doing otherwise you are doomed  explaining the combo  there are many ways to combo with phantom knights BA due to their plethora amounts of extenders and choices you can do  extender cards are: psychic wheelder, kagemucha knight, emergency teleport(to bring out wheelder),tour guide from the underworld(bring out a free material to set up your plays), danger monsters (since they are level 3 and can special summon from the hand for free)and finally phantom knights of silent boots( free special summon from hand if you control a phantom knight monster.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  one combo for example is tour guide and kagemucha knight  &nbsp;  normal summon the tour guide from hand, activate the eff of tour guide then chain kagemucha knight special summoning itself, summon a graff from the deck  link away tour guide or kagemucha knight and graff to summon a cherubini from the extra  use graff eff from gy to summon a cir from the deck  use cherubini eff to send a gloves from deck to GY  use gloves eff to send a tear scale from deck to GY  link away cherubini and cir to summon rusty knights from the extra  cir effect will activate to summon a cherubini from the gy(dont summon it to where rusty is pointing at)  use rusty eff to send a cloak from deck to gy and set a blade  use cloak eff to add a silent boot from deck to hand  tear scale will activate summoning itself from gy  special summon boots from hand  xyz summon both of them into a leviair  detach boots to summon a gloves from the banish zone  link away leviair and gloves into a anaconda  boots effect to banish itself and add a blade  anaconda eff to send red eyes fusion and summon a dragoon  then you can either set the blade or keep it in hand for next turn  with two cards you just set up three negates and a board removal  if the blades go to the gy you can use them to revive any phantom knights from your gy then if you still have scale from gy you can summon it as well so you can go into an xyz for next turn  this isnt the only combo there is in PK BA there are multiples you can do and this deck can go through many negates"

I run Quaking Mirror Force because it's good against Zoodiac and Dinossaur;  2. The reason why I don't main Village of the Spellcasters is because the format don't have spell based decks and Majespecter can't spam turn 1 consistently, that means the opponent will only try to attack your spellcaster before resolving their spells;  3. This format is a control format, don't need a lot of handtraps like the last format, that's the reason why I just run 3 ashes, gamma is dead on this deck, but you can side deck it if you want;  4. DO NOT SWAP Desires for Extravagance. This deck needs their extra deck toolboxes when the fuel on the main deck ends. When Blazing Vortex arrives, you may consider Pot of Disparity;  5. This deck have bad matchups against non targetable Monsters and floodgates. You need to consider this if you're thinking in modifying this build;  6. The reason why I run a single copy of the Magistus Aleister is because he's a name for Ties and Majesty, since he can change it's own attribute for wind, and can be revived from the GY for selene target after.  &nbsp;"

Handtraps help achieving that, as well as cards like ""widow anchor"" &amp; ""shark cannon"".</span>  <em><span><strong>In-Depth:</strong></span></em>  The goal going 1st is, to be able to disrupt the opponent with handtraps, Sky Striker Spells &amp; Machina Citadel, so that he can not buid a board on his own and has to pass on very few cards, which have no disruptive effects. Once the gamestate is slowed down, its sky strikers turn to shine. The deck is very good at generating ressources with cards like Area Zero, Kagari, Shizuku &amp; Multirole. The Machina Engine helps with that. Besides Citadel being a boss monster for the deck, the trap (Machina Overdrive) can recycle Sky Striker Link Monsters from grave and the banished zone to get an additional draw. That makes it a very good foolish burial goods target, just to get ressources back and generate a draw. Also you can send the trap to the grave with Area Zero to get an excate plus recycling and a draw, so thats pretty neat. The trap also special summons from hand, so even if you drew your Citadel you can still use it.  <strong>Its very important, </strong>that if you drew Raye or Roze and Machina Overdrive and you dont have another Sky Striker Monster, you use the endphase-search-effect of Shizuku to search Hornet-Drones, to make sure you have a monster going into your next turn. You need it, because Machina Overdrive destroys your own monster (not as cost) in order to special summon the citadel from deck. So next turn you have to have a sky striker monster or Hornet-Drones to be able to play. <strong>Also </strong>i would suggest you use your sky striker spells before you activate Machina Overdrive because Citadel prevents you from activating them. Then again, it's a Quick-effect so you can just use it to nuke itself and the opponents board free your Main Monster zone. Also, if your opponent activates a card like Lightning Storm as their first card you can at least have a Quick-Effect-Raigeki to disrupt your opponent instead of having nothing. You can also use it, when your sky striker monster is targetted for an effect, that would destroy it, so you would lose your Monster anyways but that way you at least get a boss monster on your board. In case you have Raye in grave you can also just special summon it back from grave, wait for battle phase, use its effect to special summon kaina, to make 1 monster unable to attack this turn and afterwards activate Overdrive to special summon Citadel and nuke the opponents board in the battle phase (of course you use Kaina's effect on a monster which has more than 3000 Atk, because this monster will not be destroyed by Citadel.  Machina Citadel can be special summoned from grave, when Kaina (Machine; Earth) gets destroyed by battle or card effect. So you can run into a bigger monster with Kaina, to special summon from grave both Raye &amp; Citadel. Then you have a Quick-Effect Raigeki (3000 Atk Beater) and can use Raye's effect to tag out into hayate for 1500 damage. So it helps dealing with opponents monsters on both turns (non-targeting), as well as dealing damage. If you need to get rid of Citadel, you can just use Area Zero's effect on it to excavate 3 and add 1 ""Sky Striker""-Spell and chain the effect of Citadel to nuke the opponents board. Then, as I mentioned before, you can get it back from the grave with Kaina.  As an additional boss monster the deck has access (no pun intended) to <strong>Accesscode-Talker</strong>. <strong>Ningirsu</strong> can help to get to Accesscode Talker if you play it like this: Use your opponents monsters you stole with widow anchor or Shark Cannon or your own link monsters (Zeke &amp; 1 other) to go into Ningirsu. Make sure Area Zero is on the field. Then you use the effect of Ningirsu to non-target send one card on either side of the board to the graveyard. On your own board you send the Area Zero which triggers in grave to special summon 1 ""Sky Striker Ace"" Monster from your deck. Now you can go into Accesscode Talker and target Ningirsu in grave to gain 3000 Atk and just blow up the opponent's board maybe even end the game then &amp; there.  The reason, why Foolish Burial Goods is at 3 copies is that all Sky Striker spells, Metalfoes fusion, Machina Overdrive and after siding also World Dino Wrestling are good targets to mill and gain beneficial effects. You can also cut it to 1 and play more copies of Pot of Desires, of course, but i just hate playing the card (while loving the +1). In my opinion Mystical Space Typhoon is the best backrow removal for the deck (besides Harpie's Feather Duster and Cosmic Cyclone). Before you turn off, let me explain: It's actually pretty solid because it's 1 for 1 and often you dont need to remove so many of the opponents backrow to have a chance to play with this deck. The discard of Twin-Twister is too much of a card loss, since engage is banned and you often need the ressources. Lightning Storm is only good going 2nd but the deck is good going 2nd anyways and everybody knows that so most players will make you go 1st if they can. Going 1st is the biggest problem of Sky Strikers (besides outing Towers) and this deck build ensures that even Going 1st you can still disrupt your opponent and generate card advantage. Going 1st mystical space typhoon does the same as going 2nd and that's what's important. The advantage of Mystical Space Typhoon over Cosmic Cyclone in this deck is that you can pop your own Area Zero to special summon a Sky Striker monster from your deck if you really need it, so it actually makes your engine <strong>more consistent</strong>, which is important, because the engage-ban was a HUGE consistency hit for the deck. Depending on the match-up you can of course side the Cosmic Cyclones.  One very big flaw of the Sky Striker cards is that most of them either <strong>destroy </strong>or <strong>target</strong>. In this version of the deck you play cards like Ningirsu (non-targetting send) and also Roze (non-targetting negate). In terms of non-targetting destruction you have Citadel, Accesscode and also cards like Jamming Waves. Also Nibiru helps clearing your opponents board if they overextend, of course. So in this deck, you pretty much have answers to all cards your opponent might play.  Instead of Impermanence you can also play Forbidden Chalice, as its a spell and call also be used going 2nd if you already control a monster so it doesnt limit you the way Impermanence does (it only really makes a difference if you face a monster like Zexal &amp; VFD, because they can play around Impermanence but not as easily around Chalice - except Virtual World). Then again, Impermanence is a hand trap and chalice isn't, so I guess it is up to your preference.  In the side deck there are cards for both going 1st &amp; 2nd, which you can use depending on the match-up. I just remembered that I like to side Kaijus in the deck so that would be a change i would make in the list (good removal).  I hope I explained the theory behind this build properly. It's really fun and I win many games against competitive decks like Zoodiac, Dogmatika Invoked, Dinos, and so on. Maybe I can even motivate people to try this version of the deck. If I change the deck list I will upload the new version but until now I've been very happy with the deck.  &nbsp;"

It's fairly similar to the one I built for Cryptid's tourney (before I got banned), just with some much needed modifications. Credit to Toon and the Halqifibrax PFP man for helping me with the equip part.  A good few of the equip's, if not all, will prob get banned but whatever. Also, I'd like to point out that what's really notable with this deck is how it can switch between an aggresive focus, combo, and control at a breakneck speed. It can summon powerful monsters like Rebellion to easily push for game, pull off large and over complicated combos, but also easily switch off of that to control the tempo with stupid shit like Fog Blade. PK's and their support in Phantom Rage have a lot of interesting potential for degeneracy. Also i've been calling Arc Rebellion Rebellion most of the guide so ignore that <span>Deck guide</span>  3x Cloak- Cloak is a monster you want to keep in the deck, but is too good to run at any lower numbers. Just hope you don't draw into it.  Cloak searches out literally any card of the archetype, which means you want to be dumping it into the grave as soon as possible by using it as XYZ or link material or sending it by Boots. You can easily send it by Boots from the deck, or you can normal summon it and link it off for Isolde or Bardiche. 3x Boots- Boots is another one of the deck's big playmakers, as it SS's itself as long as you control a PK. This effect is quite solid for field presence, and gathering up enough Dark's/Warrior's/Level3's. You can also normal summon Boots in a pinch and use it with Kage, although it's better to SS it. And in the grave, it searches any PK spell/trap, which means an instant fog blade, sword, or briganade. The best targets are Fog Blade and Sword, as you can get Fog Blade for a more control focused game if that's what you're going for, or a Sword to help buff up your Isolde or Bardiche that are on the field. But you can also use it to fetch a Briganade to extend plays, as a Briganade plus the two Dark warrior's from Isolde means a Bardiche.  Forgot to mention, it can also get Rank Up to turbo into the XYZ Dragons to finish off the game. 3x Gloves- Gloves gives a 1k boost to the dark XYZ, helping to push them to higher attack levels and push for an OTK due to the insane attack strength effect of Rebellion. And in the grave, Gloves can send any PK monster, to basically extend plays and fill in the gaps of whatever you need in your hand since so many of them are searchers. 3x Spained Greaves- Spained Greaves is another one of the extenders, as alongside Boots it SS's itself (although on a much tighter condition). Spained Greaves is really helpful for getting more monsters on the field, as he can help to get out at least 3 Dark's and turbo into a Bardiche on turn 1. In the grave, he can special another PK from your hand, and he can increase it's level by 1. You rarely, if ever, want to increase the level, but the effect in general is fairly nice for extending plays or for making more monsters mid to late game. 3x Torn Scales- the one card that Konami just had to make expensive for no reason and ruin the idea of PK being a fairly nice budget option. Anyway, Torn Scales gives you graveyard setup and props the discard effects of the Dangers! on discard, or can do double graveyard setup. This effect is fantastic, as the PK's are very graveyard relient. And in the grave, when another PK banishes for cost, it special's itself, which is great for extending plays. Danger! engine- They all do the same thing, so i'm not gonna explain them all one by one. They're all Darks that can special summon themselves easily and can (potentially) discard PK cards for more graveyard setup. As Dark's on the field, they're great targets for Fog Blade. 3x Kagemucha Knight- Kagemucha Knight is a great monster, as most of the monsters in the deck are level 3. So you can easily special summon it, and it has particular synergy since it's a Dark warrior, making it work hand in hand as Isolde fodder/target, and fodder for Bardiche. 3x Rank-Up- Rank-Up is great for ranking your Break Sword up into one of the XYZ dragons. Since you'll be dumping out so many Dark's, you can easily banish a few to rank up the Bardiche directly into Rebellion. Rebellion heavily punishes swarm decks, as it steals their attack and in certain situations can push for game all on it's own. Mid-to late game you can make a break sword, rank it up into Rebellion and push for game. 1x Rota- Literally searches most of the deck, filling in the gaps of your hand to get you whatever you need. It's limited for a reason. 3x Desires- The main draw spell, Desires's is technically a -7 (i probably did that math wrong but whatever) but is completely worth it, due to how good drawing 2 is.  Just make sure you use it after using Isolde, so you don't banish any precious equips. 1x Hautaclere- Hautaclere is mainly useful for enabling powerful monsters like Rebellion and a beefed up Bardiche to attack twice, which can easily help push for game. And on destruction of the equipped monster, it gets a pop, which is a pretty nice bonus. 1x Pheonix Blade- Ah yes, the banned-in-the-OCG card. Phoenix blade is mainly good for looping, as as long as you dump a good amount of warriors to the grave, you can continually loop Phoenix Blade for a good while. 1x Smoke Grenade- Smoke Grenade is a great target for the sorta-cost of Rusty's pop, as it gives you a hand rip and info on the opponent, and also a great target for Bardiche's pop. Generally a really good card. 3x Fog Blade- The main card that Bardiche searches, Fog Blade is great for more of a control focus. It  can allow you to basically shut down the opponent's strongest monsters or their key combo pieces while they're still in the middle of their combo, basically interrupting everything they're doing and leaving them open for you to hit hard. And in the grave, it can SS a PK from the grave, making it a control card and combo extender. 3x Sword- Sword allows you to buff the Isolde and Bardiche that are left on the field, which is what I mainly use it for, as they're valuable monsters I don't want run over. Although, you can also use Sword to buff other stuff like Rebellion when you're gonna push for game. Sword is another good target for Bardiche, when you're out of Fog Blade. And, in the grave, it does the same thing as Fog Blade, making it an aggresive card/extender. 2x Briganade- Briganade is fantastic for being a trap that can be activated easily, as you shouldn't be having many traps in the grave, if any, when you activate Briganade, which makes it much faster than normal traps. It also is great fodder for Bardiche and Isolde. Sadly, it has no GY effect. <span>The extra deck <span>3x Break Sword- One of the first cards to summon, Break Sword has some nice removal. When summoning it, you'll probably not use it's effect and try to immediately rank it up. Although, if you have a Infernoble Equip (it's name is too hard to spell for a second time) or a Smoke Grenade in hand, you can equip either to him and pop one for advantage on the opponent.  Then rank it up. </span></span>2x Alucard- Alucard's only really here because it's another Dark XYZ. But i mean, it can hurt Altergeist, so that's a plus. 1x Dark Rebellion- Dark Rebellion is rarely used, but can be of use sometimes if you don't have enough darks to push for Arc Rebellion. 1x Arc Rebellion- Arc Rebelllion is a all around fantastic beater. Due to it's effect, it can grow to huge level's of strength against most of the decks that are played nowadays, due to how many montsers they have on the field. And combined with cards like Sword and the Infernoble equip, it can finish the game in one turn. Just be wary of battle traps. 3x Zeus- If you don't have a rank-up spell, this is what you want to rank up Break Sword into. Zeus is quick effect, non targeting, non destruction removal, which is fantastic, as it avoids so many effects nowadays and it's very hard to respond to. Zeus is also a 3k beater and all around great card. 2x Isolde- a key playmaker of the deck, Isolde allows you to special out a monster and gain advantage from sent cards. also, mommy milkers. 1x Bardiche- A key card of the deck, Bardiche is something you want to turbo into. Bardiche helps to set up strong backrow with Fog Blade/Sword, allowing you to easily control the game and hit hard at the same time. Additionally, it sets up the grave as it searches and gets to pop cards as you make your XYZ. 2x Avramax- Avramax is another option late game, in case you've ran out of a lot of your other cards and need to close off the game. <span>Playing guide <span>Well, here we are. The deck's main focus is to shit out as many monsters as possible, using stuff like Boots, Spained Greaves, etc and the Danger! engine  for their special summoning effects.. Afterwards, make an Isolde, get out tons more monsters and make a Bardiche. Banish your cards to get tons more resources back and to prop other card's effects. Set up strong backrow and control the gamestate from there And then on turn 2, you go into your powerful XYZ like Rebellion or Zeus, and either continue wittling down the opponent from there, or close off the game in one fell swoop. </span></span>Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. Have a good day!"

They are a means to an end that terminates at ABC-Dragon Buster (ABC-DB). Dogmatika is resilient, Ecclesia &amp; Fleurdelis have staying power and the potential to swarm. Each offensive battle makes them more difficult to beat over. And so, here's how I've made two unlikely archetypes into a whole: Ojamatika.  Let's start with the Ojamas. Get them out of your hand an into the graveyard, ideally one each of the trio. Ojama blue can be used to search any two card combination of Ojamassimilation, Ojama Pajama, Ojamagic, and Ojamatch. My go-to is Ojamassimilation and Ojama Pajama. As with the Ojamas, the A-, B-, C- union pieces need to be out of the hand. B- can search A-, A- can get back B-, and B- can search again for C-. However many union pieces are still within the deck are how many Ojamas are needed for Ojamassimilation, as a minimum. Ojamagic is useful here as this card will get green, yellow, and black into the hand. From here, either use Ojamassimilation immediately, or wait for Ojama Red (perhaps searched for with Ojamatch, pitching Ojamagic and using the effect to normal summon Armed Dragon, followed by the turn normal summon of Red) to summon the whole lot and link into Saryuja. Either way, bansih the trio with Ojamassimilation and return them to the deck while also drawing a card. Assemble the brought forth Union pieces into ABC-DB. In the next turn, you can search for another copy of Ojamagic with Pajama and either discard it immediately, or use it for the cost of ABC-DB giving four turns worth of fuel for ABC-DB. Two copies of Ojamassimilation are included for two reasons. One, as back-up, and two, vanilla ojamas early on can quickly become Union pieces (generally being more substantial).  While the Ojama trio was butting in by any means necessary, elements of the Dogmatika engine were likely coming in. I typically use them as I see the need; however, there is a nice set-up which this deck adopts from more artistic deck designers, and it goes a little something like this...: Use Nadir to pitch Apkallone which searches for Schism and promptly sending it to grave (if Schism is already in hand with an Ojamagic, discard Ojamagic),get Maximus. Special Summon Maximus and activate them to send down Titaniklad and Construct, set Schism. At the end of turn, Special Summon Ecclessia by effect of Titaniklad, and use Ecclessia's effect to search Fleurdelis. During the opponents Main Phase, activate Schism to Fusion Summon Winda. I typically wait until their's a problem effect monster on my opponent's field to bring out Fleurdelis. And that's really about all I have to say about the Dogmatika crew...  For general strategy, I use ABC-DB to blow face-down cards and backrow, fueled by Ojamas; the Dogmatika beatdown my opponent's monsters. When necessary or just to flex, I use Dogmatika punishment to smite with Psy-Framelord Omega which allows me to recover them self and another card (perhaps the Punishment previously activated, an N'tss, or a fallen Fleurdelis). Super Polymerization is good for pitching Ojamas/Ojamagic (be vigilant as to whats on the field, Dogmatika are light-spellcasters and Ojama are light-beasts, targets for Mudragon).  Feel free to leave me suggestions, comments, and critique. This is a casual deck meant for a laugh. It can win quickly and OTK, I've managed it in three turns...make that two turns.  1000 years Ojamatika."

I'm not mad... just disappointed  Edit:  When I made this deck it was really just for me to bitch about VFD still being around (clearly), but I never expected it to be my most viewed deck, and I wasn't very proud of it, so I made some adjustments to the deck so that I may not hate it any more. I was right that VW would be one of the best decks in the upcoming format (because it's really good even without VFD (except for when it isn't)). I made a lot of dumb mistakes in the original build, like not playing cloudcastle or desires, I have fixed that now, as well as putting in zeus because it's really good. I also added the Ultimaya Tzolkin engine because it seems really cool and the deck can do it really easily, there's also a better rank 6 toolbox in the updated version, but that isn't the most important thing for the deck. Overall I feed much better after the adjustments with this deck, I can finally have my conscience cleared of this deck."

Going second there are plenty of hand traps to keep your counter play manageable. I am not a huge fan of playing three Aleisters but after playing with the deck it is extremely helpful to have him + Adin to start. With these two cards you can potentially go into Dragoon and Mechaba. You play Aleister, search invocation, link aliester off into Almiraj. Here is way the combo changes path from the normal one just a little. Instead of linking into Gardna you special summon Adin from hand and link into Verte. I do not know why but everyone assumes Adin locks you out of the extra deck but this is not the case. Now you have Aleister and a light in grave with Verte on field. Fuse into Mechaba, bring aliester back, and now you have protection to use Verte to go into Dragoon. This combo can also be played with ANY of the dogmatika monsters expect for the newest one and I guess Max because he needs a extra deck monster in grave. IF you do not activate Ecclesia's second effect to search then you are not locked out of the extra deck. The new dogmatika is played for an easy special summon and if played with punishment it will recur Punishment back to hand.  If you can not get into Dragoon or Mechaba this deck can play through the Dogmatika engine, in particular Punishment. I chose book of moon instead of another imper because book of moon seems to be better against zoodiac but I could be wrong. Finally, Adin is a super over looked card in my opinion it can hold of Extra deck focused decks by not being able to be destroyed by battle plus on destruction he searches Ecclesia which then can search something else. This deck is really consistent and pretty fun to play.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Going second, also isn't very difficult depending on how many negates you opponent has. Usually the ultimate goal is to go into Risen-Dragite in order to non-target remove most of my enemy's cards. This works incredibly well by setting up the top 5 cards of your deck with the field spell."

Here's Dino's that utilizes a Rescue Rabbit engine and other fairly unorthodox stuff. While this is still  meta, it does have a few things to note that sets it apart from other Dino decks. Credit to Rondasrich for his Dino builds, they were a great help in building this. Might make Invoked Dinos in the future, who knows. <span>Deck guide <span>2x Tyranno- The main boss monster, Tyranno is great and aggresive. He can easily clear out entire boards, deal huge damage, and deal a little extra burn damage from the face down effect alongside that. This makes Tyranno an amazing boss monster that's hard to interrupt due to Misc and Lost World. You can also easily get it out due to how many Dino's will be in the grave, and how Double Evo can get it out easily, since it negates its summoning conditions. </span></span>1x Pankratops- Pankratops is a great choice as it's more dinosaur fodder that can easily special summon itself and gives you a free pop to remove problem cards or draw out negates. You can also just altogether not use Pankratop's pop and use it as fodder for Tyranno or something like that. 1x Petiteradon- Petiteradon allows you to get out Oviraptor, Pankratops, and Megalo easily. It can easily be popped by Oviraptor, making it easy to get into more monsters to extend your plays. Fun fact: It has the egg on top of it's head because it summons high leveled monsters. 3x Oviraptor- Oviraptor is a huge playmaker for the deck, and for a good reason. On any sort of summon, it searches a majority of the deck, filling in the gaps of your hand and providing more monsters for your plays. And Oviraptor is able to pop another dino to special a dino from the grave, which is just pure advantage as long as you pop Pepiteradon or Babyceraarus. 3x Misc- Have you read it? Jokes aside, Misc gives full protection to all your dinosaurs from opponent's effects, making them immune. This is even better because this is a discard cost to activate it, making it a quick effect, and it's graveyard set up. And in the grave, Misc banishes itself and other Dino's to special a Dino from deck who's level adds up to the number of Dino's banished from grave. Misc should've been banned but Konami is stupid. 3x Babycerasauras- Babycerausarus (god i always struggle to spell it's name) is great for is pop effect. On destruction, it specials a level 4 or lower Dino from deck. this is a great effect, as it's easy to prop by Oviraptor and is very helpful to extend your plays. Fun fact: Baby's shell is on it's bottom because it only summons level 4 or lower monsters. 3x Archosaur- Archosaur serves to be that one card in the deck to be super expensive for no reason and ruin the idea of it possibly being a good budget option. Archosaur,  on summon, pops another dino on field or in hand (so it can prop the babies or it can even pop cards in the hand for more graveyard setup) to fetch a Double Evo Pill. Double Evo Pill is great as it allows you to easily get into Tyranno. 3x Rescue Rabbit- Rescue Rabbit is another one of the deck's playmakers. It serves to summon two Megalosmasher's from deck, which is great for starting or extending plays and  shitting out more Dino's.  Also the non-Dino for Double Evo, alongside Ash. Megalosmasher X- Mainly just exists to be summoned off of Rabbit, so it's a complete garnet in hand, which is a pain. The best it can do is be popped by Archosaur or be banished away for Tyranno or Double Evo. It was only chosen because it's a vanilla dino with the highest attack. 1x Light barrier- An idea i borrowed from Ronda, Light Barrier serves to be a big floodgate. Since our boss monster is a Light, this can easily cripple the opponent's plays as long as we drop it around the end of our plays. Light's aren't super common rn either, so that's nice. 3x Ash Blossom- Ash Blossom serves to interrupt and destroy plays from the opponent, as it can easily stop searches (which decks rely on), and well timed, it can stop entire plays and combos. Just don't drop it on the first thing you see. And no, Jobe, it's not getting limited. 3x Lost World- Lost world serves multiple purposes. Since it summons a token to your opponent's field, while yes, it is fodder for the opponent, it does give you an extra layer of protection alongside Misc, making it insanely hard to out your high attack dino's. Aditionally, Lost World nerfs the attack of non-dino's, making it much easier to beat over your opponent's monsters (unless you're in a mirror match). 3x Fossil Dig- Fossil Dig is the deck's Rota, but unlimited, as it searches nearly all of the deck and gives you everything you need. It also doesn't have a once per turn, meaning you can shit out fossil digs whenever you want. I'm also pretty sure the paper airplane guys are on the art. 2x Double Evo- Double Evo is the main way to turbo into Tyranno, as it banishes the Dino's you've shat out into the grave to get out a Tyranno easily and ignores it's summoning conditions, making it easier to get. 1x Terraforming- Terraforming easily searches out Lost World, as Lost World is a fantastic card. 1x One for One- One for One gives you graveyard setup and gets you out Archosaur, easily. 1x Foolish Burial- Foolish also gives you more Graveyard setup for other cards like Tyranno and Misc. 1x Monster Reborn- Monster Reborn can easily bring back your Tyranno or something of the sort if it's popped. 3x Extravagance- The deck's main draw power, Extrav banishes your useless extra deck and gives you extra draws. I'm not going to go through the extra deck. It's all banish fodder with fringe uses sometimes. <span>Playing guide <span>The main goal is to turbo out Conductor and shat out your Dino's on the way. At the start of the turn, the priority is to activate Lost World or search and activate it, and activate Misc (or search and activate it), to ensure you have protection for your plays. Afterwards, you'll want to do the usual shit. Summon out Oviraptor to pop the baby's and get out all the monsters you need, get out your Archosaur and use it's eff to pop Oviraptor and search Double Evo, use Double Evo and go into Conductor and drop the Barrier around the end. Once you have Conductor on the field, you're good to go to OTK. Along the way, you can also SS Pankratops for the pop and use the Rabbit strat, to get out the Megalo's for more fodder for other Dino's and such. </span></span>Any suggestions and such is appreciated. Thank you, have a nice day!"

This in fact does affect dragon link but not that much. This is the post banlist version of dragon link, it is in fact not as good as the original but can still need on the exact same end board with more extenders. I made this deck in a way that you would consistently draw a hand to fo full combo, I would say we just have to wait for the meta to shape up and see where dragon link is compared to the other decks! It will definitely be meta but just not the best deck of the format or anything. Have fun playing!         </span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you wish to hand rip and extra card from the opponent’s hand instead of drawing 2 cards with crocodragon, the you can switch it out for trishula (the synchro monster). Also make sure to answer the poll question down below! Today’s poll question is: Which of your banlist predictions didn’t happen? If you are interested in an in-depth deck explanation and combo tutorial, I recommend watching my youtube video, subscribe to the channel and like the video - it is a great way to support me and the channel. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link to the video - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmliyvnBXKU</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thanks and I’ll see you next time! :D                                  </span>"
