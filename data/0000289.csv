The Magistus Engine makes this deck extremely viable.,"This IMO is the best version of a Pre-POTE Exosister deck! It's very consistent with the help of the Magistus Engine.  Since we don't have Malfa at the moment in the TCG and Master Duel, Zoroa will act as your Malfa. It can special summon a spellcaster monster from the hand or graveyard and Artemis can search another Zoroa for next turn! Also since it's a tuner and it can equip itself with a link, it's also a 1 card Borreload Savage Dragon!  You can also change Solemn Judgment to Solemn Strike or another playset of handtraps, but I prefer playing them to protect my field from going 2nd cards.

Branded Variant.,"I will upload a video of combos and strategy eventually, with an in depth guide to each Dogmatika card.  In short, this deck wants to go first and setup a variety of different boards depending on the cards you open. Generally, you want your Rituals to snipe your opponents extra, or your fusions to interrupt your opponents plays.  Side Deck consists of going second cards to break boards. They are generally considered weaker because they only have utility going second, but if you know your opponent will go first, then they are a  good side deck choice."

If I had 3 Prosperity I would play that with 1 Extrav over 3 Extrav 1 Requital.  •Playing  1 DD crow actually came in clutch during the late grind game because it gave me an extra Robina target as well as disruption.  •Imperm came up a time or two in game 1’s which helped add a little more disruption, but I would usually side it out for Featherstorm.  •Raiza loop wins games.

Very powerful in a casual format ,"White Aura Fish Synchro Combos:  This is a fish Synchro/Xyz spam combo deck that takes advantage of some of the insane generic water and fish support. It can do some crazy things facilitate floodgates, OTKs, and play through some disruptions. It can take advantage of a very large Sychro and Rank 4 Xyz pool. This mostly operates at a casual to low-rouge status. It won’t take any event tops, but could definitely steal some wins.  &nbsp;  This deck has a few combo/playlines that come up fairly frequently. The main goal is to spit out your giant boss monsters from the depths. If you are going first try and make Adamancipator Dragite, for the disruption and if your going second try and make White Aura Whale and Bihamut for a potential OTK. This deck can take advantage and make almost any synchro monster, using Magalancia you can alter the monster levels to make any synchro needed. This deck can also utilize some of the new support from the Duelist from the Deep Booster. This is probably one of my favorite decks ever, I love the idea of all of these ancient and powerful sea monsters rising up from the depths. It s a sold deck and can hold its own quite well in a more casual format.  &nbsp;  Combos and Tips: <ol>  	<li>Your main starters are Lifeless Leafish or Beatunaful Princess to SS Lealfish or Royal Swamp Eel from the deck. Use Leafishe’s foolish burial effect to dump usually Fishborg Launcher or Coelacanth any level 4 fish if you open White Mirror.</li>  	<li>The main tuners are Gluttonous Reptolphin Greethys, FIshborg Launcher, and Royal Swamp Eel. You will usually SS Swamp Eel from the deck or the GY. Greethys can SS a fish from the grave and gives his Synchro’d monster a nice attack boost, fishborg you want Foolished for his SS effect.</li>  	<li>White Mirror is an insane extender, it’s a +1. The main targets are Silent Angler or Greethys you can SS one from the grave to add the other to the hand you can then SS Silent Angler from the hand for 2 bodies on the field for any Xyz play.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Main Combos:  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li>Opening Hand: Greethys + Silent Angler- summon Greethys and SS Angler from the hand. Synchro for White Aura Monoceros, trigger his effect SS Greethys from GY. Use Greethys effect to SS Silent angler back from GY in def. Synchro Greehtys and Monoceros into Barrone de Fleur. Use Greethys effect to boost Fleurs attack to 4000.</li>  	<li>Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth: SS him from GY with Monster Reborn, White Aura Monoceros, Number 37, or Whitefish Salvage.

It's pretty fun and allows for alternate routes. Buster Dragon turns every monster on your opponents side into the Dragon typing which can be disruptive when they need to use specific monster types for extra deck plays. Exosisters are able to go into rank 4 monsters pretty quickly especially with the help of the familiars.  You can soft lock your opponent by just starting with a single Whelp. Simply normal summon Whelp search prologue and go into Almiraj. Use prologue on your opponents turn to target Memories and a Buster Blader to go into Buster Dragon. Then you banish Memories and use the Whelp from your first turn and the Blader to summon Dragon Destroyer.  With this, your opponents side is soft locked and they will have to spend resources to get rid of your field or end their turn if they are heavily relying on activated effects from monsters.  Still playing around with the build and changing it as I go."

I tuned the deck to be as consistent and as pure as possible, the classical ""floodgate gravekeeper"" uses too many handtraps, solemns etc. to be consistent (but it can actually work very well, see the side deck for some cards you might want to side in if a more floodgatey playstyle is needed). So lets look at the cards...</span>  <span><strong>Necrovalley (+ Terraforming, + Commandant, + Throne)</strong></span>  <span>The backbone of the whole archetype. Blocks cards in the GY from being banished, blocks any effect that would move a card from the GY to a different spot (e.g. <em>Monster Reborn</em>) and effects that would include changing types or attributes in the GY (e.g. <em>Zombie Worlds</em> first effect). This card is able to block a lot of plays and we need it to use the effect of <em>Spiritualist</em> for fusion summoning <em>Supernaturalist </em>(and then profiting from the destruction protection). Together with <em>Terraforming</em> and <em>Commandant</em> we practically play 7 versions of necrovalley and because we can search commandant with <em>Throne</em> we basically play 10 copies of necrovalley.</span>  <span><em>Necrovalley</em> also gives all Gravekeeper Monsters a 500 ATK/DEF bonus which makes them quite impressive beatsticks.</span>  <span><strong>Spiritualist (+ Polyermerization)</strong></span>  <span>The second most important part of our strategy. To fusion summon <em>Supernaturalist</em> (SN) we either need <em>Spiritualist</em> + <em>Necrovalley</em> (see Necrovalley) or we can directly use <em>Polyermization</em>. Personally I found only few builds that use the classical <em>Polymerization</em> but I found it to essential to increase the consistency and amount of options.</span>  <strong><span>Supernaturalist</span></strong>  <span>Our fusion summoned boss monster. Gains 100 ATK/DEF for each level used for the fusion summoning. Summoning with 2 lv 4s and <em>Necrovalley</em> on the field this already becomes a 3300 ATK and DEF beatstick. Protects itself and <em>Necrovalley</em> from destruction (as long as <em>Necrovalley</em> is on the field). Also gives the opportunity to search a 'Gravekeeper' monster or 'Necrovalley' card from the deck in the end phase (sadly the end phase, that could bring some really strong negates otherwise). You basically have 1 main go-to options here: search for <em>Throne</em> (most generic and strongest search card in the archetype). But you could also search for <em>Hidden Temples </em>or <em>Tomb of Necrovalley </em>as this either gives the option to completely lock out the opponent from special summoning monsters or gives you another negate - but the consistency might be weakened if your opponent is able to break 'your board'.</span>  <span>Another option is to search for <em>Headman</em> if you have <em>Spiritualist</em> in the GY: this allows you to special summon her to the field and fusion summon another <em>Supernaturalist</em>.</span>  <strong><span>Necrovalley Throne (+ Allure of Darkness, + Upstart Goblin, + Pot of Desires, + Stele)</span></strong>  <span>Throne basically lets you search any <em>Gravekeeper</em> monster, in most cases you are either searching <em>Spiritualist</em> or <em>Commandant</em> (the latter to get access to <em>Necrovalley</em>). The second effect is in my experience rarely the right choice, but the side deck contains some Rank 3 and Rank 4 xyz that might be an out in some situations.</span>  <span>We also play <em>Allure</em>, <em>Upstart</em> and <em>Desires</em> just to boost our consistency. These cards are essential to get to the cards we want and really need. Also we dont play <em>Demise</em> because we want to turbo out <em>Supernaturalist</em>. Beyond that, <em>Gravekeeper's Stele </em>allows us to add 2<em> Gravekeeper </em>monsters to our hand from the GY (ignoring <em>Necrovalley</em>) and is together with <em>Headman</em> our only way to recycle ressources.</span>  <strong><span>Other Gravekeepers</span></strong>  <em>Spy</em> is a strong card with a lot of defense especially if necrovalley is on the field, we can summon <em>Spirtiualist</em> (if there are not attacks left) or <em>Recruiter</em> (for another search if destroyed). <em>Guard</em> is basically only here so we can use non-destruction removal if needed and Descendant if we really need to get rid of a card. <em>Headman</em> can be used to special summon a lvl 4 monster from the GY (sadly <em>Headman</em> is lv 3 otherwise this would be really good opportunity for an xyz summon), main play here is to ressurrect <em>Spirutualist</em> and fusion summon again.  In general the ration of <em>Descendant</em>, <em>Recruiter </em>and <em>Guard</em>  doesnt matter too much, they can be tech cards, but mainly we need some monsters for fusion summoning. Sadly I was not really able to get other Gravekeepers cards in here really, most of them are sadly just too bad.  <strong><span>Tech Cards (+ Extra Deck)</span></strong>  <span>We play the Dark Kaiju <em>Radian</em> (to allow usage of  <em>Allure</em>) and a copy of <em>Rite of Spirit </em>which might help to recover a destroyed <em>Supernaturalist</em> or to further stall the opponent. We play a <em>Starving Venom</em> if we have poly + Kaiju + 1 Dark in our hand, just so we are not stuck doing nothing. The other extra deck cards are just some generic rank3/rank4s  that might come up handy, a really nice tech card is <strong>Akashic magician</strong> that gives a really nice option for non-destruction removal.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The fusions themselves are not incredibly impressive, though with the help of Instant/Ready Fusion, Mobile Base should be easy to get out.  However, while the deck CAN do fusions, it mostly specializes in searching for Expressroid and Ambulanceroid to swam the field with roid monsters and get cool link plays. Dragonroid, Gear Gigant X, Pot of Prosperity and Megaroid City help you find them, while the Gadgets get you started, and Platinum is usually how you'll end up getting Expressroid onto the field for its effect.  Emergeroid Call is tempting as an omni-negate, but it's also just another card that returns a roid from grave to hand, which in this case means Special Summon if you have Ambulanceroid out.  Still trying to get the deck as consistent as possible, and while it can't really fit handtraps with this mix of fusion and link summoning, you can theoretically make a much more skim list with only the link aspects and actually have hand traps for interruptions."

In Virtual World, we can use this level 6 synchro tuner to send eldlich to the GY, thus making Immortal Dragon a level 4 tuner. This allows you to end on boards with Eldlich at 3500 ATK alongside Chengying (or Barronne). Other great features include using Muddragon to get to Mirrorjade, and a tiny PUNK engine to help add negates to your board. This build is sure to turn heads at your next locals!"

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendelum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a &lt;#907791420469956678&gt; You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

I'll use this space to go over a few key choices I made for the WCQ, some tricks people may not know, and my match history.  &nbsp;  <strong>40 Card Main Deck:</strong>  One thing I was certain of this meta is that I had to be on 40 cards and it was not optional. This is because many matchups in the format are NOT WINNABLE without seeing side cards. Scythe locks, floodgates, giant boards, and cards like Zombie World are everywhere this format. Often times, drawing just engine makes the game impossible to win. I kept my deck to 40 specifically to increase my chances of drawing side cards. Both for going first and for going second. This paid off immensely today as the majority of my games I opened a blow out side card in backrow removal or something like anti-spell. Some of my ratios are a little weird because of this with things like Adhara at 2, but it was more than worth it.  <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird:</strong>  I respect the Floowandereeze matchups a lot more than I feel other players do. If you are going second, it is almost impossible to win without seeing a side card. This is one of the reasons I main decked droll over Nibiru. This format Swordsoul plays exceedingly well into weaker boards. Often clearing the board as part of their normal combo for setup through Baxia combo lines. I am not a huge fan of Nibiru turning off your Tenyis and Droll was an excellent substitute. Every game I drew Droll, even in multiples, I won the game. Would highly recommend trying it out for those who haven't.  &nbsp;  <strong>Heavenly Dragon Circle vs Vessel:</strong>  I play 3 circle and no vessel for my spell ratios. In my own experience, I dislike vessel alot as its only great when you open it with another Tenyi. Past that its only hand advantage and doesn't contribute to the board if you have to use it after making a token. Swordsoul boards are often fairly weak and getting otk'd before you can use your resources is a major problem. I play 3 circle for a few reasons. <ol>  	<li>Circle is effectively Crossout Designator. Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence are the 2nd and 3rd most popular handtraps behind Ash Blossom in every deck right now. Circle was a card I wanted to see in my opener every game (played 3) as it would protect my normal summon. This came up so often and completely saved me at least 5 times throughout the tournament.</li>  	<li>Second is the fact that it can turn any Tenyi into any Swordsoul. When doing your Chixiao search, you often have to decide between searching Longyuan and Blackout. With circle, you can special a Tenyi, and use it to search your starter, or a Longyuan so you can get Blackout later. This further increases the consistency of the deck as you have 14 ways of getting to your normal summon.</li>  	<li>Circle is a main deck out for Mystic Mine. In the months since the latest banlist. I looked back at my games and the majority of my losses were either to a trap floodgate, Artifact Scythe, or Mystic Mine. With circle you can tribute summon a lvl  7 Tenyi over your board and tribute it off with circle to out Mystic Mine. You can either do this on your own turn to guarantee Mystic Mine being destroyed, or you can tribute set a Tenyi over your board and set circle. During their End Phase you can tribute your monster with Circle and catch them by surprise.</li>  	<li>Many people dislike circle as many times you don't use it and they see it as a minus 1. Often times this isn't quite the case. If you have circle and go through your turn without using it, then you didn't need it. You must already be in a winning position and it didn't need to resolve in the first place. In these scenarios I set the card before passing the turn. You can combo Circle with Blackout as a cl2 to tribute your Blackout target and get your search. Furthermore, you can tribute your Wyrm on field when do a removal effect. Many times I would tribute off my own Chixiao or Monk in the End Phase to search a starter for the next turn. Then on my own turn I could use the second effect to add a Tenyi to discard for Longyuan. Furthermore, this would be a Vishuda to remove problems, or Ashuna, to get extra bodies on board for lethal.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  <strong>Forbidden Chalice vs Forbidden Droplet:</strong>  I chose to run Chalice over Droplet today primarily because I was main decking Droll &amp; Lock Bird. Many  times there is a single card on the board that is stopping your turns from going smoothly (Barrier Statue, Rexterm, Standard Boss Monsters). I found I didn't need the extra punch that Droplet provided and allowed me to keep more of my hand in the process. Furthermore, I don't play many spells in which to combo Droplets with as it was often the only spell I drew for turn. Finally, I found my biggest issue was token collector, and just having a quick 1-for-1 to deal with it instead of a 2-for-1 in Droplets was better for me. I am also siding DRNM to deal with the board breaking issue.  &nbsp;  <strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma:</strong>  I have run Final Sigma over Dragite for many months for a few reasons. The first is decks like Floowandereeze and Sky Striker. These are decks that not only need to setup, but also overcommit to beating Final Sigma. Some Floowandereeze players do not run the Extra Deck outs as there is not a single card in their main deck which beats it. This came up round 6 when I played against the Floowandereeze player who won the tournament. He used Dimension Shifter in SP and I immediately made Chixiao and used its effect to banish Blackout from deck instead of searching to make Final Sigma. It took him 4 turns to eventually waste his turn outing the card and by then I had built up enough cards in hand to easily OTKand beat him 2-0. In these matchups, Final Sigma often serves as a pseudo Mystic Mine. Against Sky Striker their only out is Accesscode Talker. If you save a monster negate, when they gain the attack, on resolution you can negate Accesscode and it loses the attack and they no longer have a way to beat it. Finally, many times on turn 3 you do a Baxia line with Taia that often banishes Blackout in the process. You have an extra token and I use Baxia and that token to make Final Sigma to OTK since it deals double damage through monsters. This comes up very often.  &nbsp;  <strong>Important Tricks:</strong>  <strong>Outing Gozen Match: </strong>  There is one specific hand going first that can beat this card. Say you Special Summon Vishuda to the board and they flip Gozen Match. You can use Heavenly Dragon Circle to tribute Vishuda off and search Adhara. You can then SS Adhara and make Monk as they are both earth. From here if you have Vishuda in Graveyard or in hand you can bounce Gozen.  &nbsp;  <strong>Outing Necroworld Banshee and Baiting with Tenyis from Hand: </strong>  In my round 3 I won game 1 by doing the following line: My oponent ended their turn with a Banshee face up on the field. For those that don't know, they can banish Banshee as a quick effect to put Zombie World on the field which is a huge lock for us. In this game I SS Vishuda first and linked it off for Monk. I then normal summoned Taia and banished Vishuda. My opponent seeing that the threat was gone and that I could synchro summon used Banshee to put Zombie World in play. I then activated adhara from hand to add the banished Vishuda back to hand and use its effect in hand to bounce the Zombie world and win that game. It is very important to be aware of when you can activate Tenyis from hand when your opponent isn't expecting it. In this scenario he could have stopped my play with Huaquero but held it as I was removing my own threat. A few other times I drew Shthana and stopped my opponent from OTK'ing me by leaving a monk on field and using Shthana to disrupt their Battle Phase.  &nbsp;  The best tip I have besides the first two is take things very slowly. Often times you can sneak a Tenyi on board or get an additional card in hand if you fully think out your plays.  &nbsp;  <strong>Match History (going 1st/2nd)</strong>  Adamancipator: 2-0 (1st)  Trap Eldlich: 2-0 (2nd)  Trap Eldlich: 2-0 (2nd)  Swordsoul: 2-1 (2nd)  Swordsoul: 2-1 (2nd)  Floowandereeze: 2-0 (1st, first place finisher)  Dragon-Link: 1-2 (1st)  Punk Pendulum: 2-1 (1st)  Punk Synchro: 2-0 (1st)  I personally wouldn't change anything about the main deck as I never lost game 1 the entire day. If you have any questions or just want to talk theory feel free to reach out to me and best of luck with your own lists!"
