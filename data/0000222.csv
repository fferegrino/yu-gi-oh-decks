It provides synergy with your normal engine while also being able to protect your combo, or help you make a board if you can't establish a Dragon Buster. Could go either way on 1 or 3 Fusion Destiny. It's a nice power play if you get disrupted but it does cost deck space."

Here’s the list I intend on using

I will be honest, this is probably the only archetype where you can name any card in it and I can list off all of it’s effects off the top of my head, every last card applies to this apparently.

I’m on a mild budget that was much too small for an accesscode so I never bothered, I honestly hope I’ll get the new printing of it without much problem.

In unrelated news I pulled the new magistus synchro monster in the bode sneak peek which is a secret rare and was temporarily pretty pricy so I’ll be making a celebratory magistus deck soon.

Have a good day!"

Mystic mine with Rocket and lampsies can burn ur opponent down.

Remember when your opponent have monsters on the field and you have prank-kid place, your place can chain the atk decrease so your opponent can't stop you from special summoning.

Combo chain: Any pkid- link 1- special summon fansies-link doo-entomb pkid fusion and chain doo to search for pkid pranks- link another doo- tribute doo for any pkid and pkid fusion- pkid pranks discard the monster for a token-bark- set the fusion spell and pass. At the start of opponent's turn, tribute bark-two pkids, then fusion for butler, and now you have two instant swipes, a 3000-3000 big guy, 3 pkid monsters and all of them can't be destroyed by effects.

DPE is the plan b, it's just simply strong.

Link spider can change the tokens so you can link anaconda. Anaconda can fetch for Thunder dragon fusion for fusioning the batler, it can also banish it from grave for kaiju or fansies."

You may also use rusty's effect to pop the scythe on your opponent's turn if you summon an xyz to a zone where it points to, namely requiem to get a few negates along with it. This could potentially be budget depending on how El Dorado turns out, but I wouldn't be too hopeful.

Advice and tips would be lovely."

Can replace some cards, take some out, but this is a solid base.

The trick is to use the trap sushi card to keep restocking the normal sushi monster. this will be fuel for your suships in your second third and beyond phases. THE NORMAL MONSTER IS KEY when you have one in your hand you can always make multiple summons, however when using to xyz summon try to use the other sushi's before the normal monster. any other xyz (Zeus, number 70, etc) should be use as a beat stick.

The suship xyz :Carrier provides effect cover only to your xyz suships when a field spell is in play."

And to navigate around the effects of Gravity bind and Level Limit Area B the support monsters to aid you in burning their life points away consistently over time while no monster higher than level 4 can attack.
and if in the event your opponent tries to destroy the lockdown cards, make sure to have judgement of Anubis on the field and target Lava Golem with it's secondary effect.

Uses banned cards.","This abomination is an attempt to make a true Knightmare deck; and when I say ""true"" I mean you have to use every card in the archetype and every support card created with them in mind. I'm gonna be honest, this deck can do some disgusting things as should be expected of banned cards, but it is not competitive in the slightest. There is no room for hand-traps or meta counter utility, we're pretty much stuck with the World Legacy support which are brick more times than not.

I would like to give a tutorial of the combos, but there are so many different ways to play each hand that its kind of impossible to simplify it. I feel that this deck is incomplete and deserves a 60 card variant that can better abuse some of the more niche strategies that can't fit in this 40 card build, but for now here is a

Strategy:

Go first, this deck cannot go second unless your opponent does nothing. The basic idea is to to use your normal summon starters like, Venus, Girsu, Iblee to set up a basic board and use Knightmare Goblin to use a second normal summon and increase your board further. This deck has a few extenders like the World Chalice, Mekk-Knight, Parallel Exceed, Pot of Avarice, used to help link climb. And a lot of in theme World Legacy support cards to act as interruptions.

Your end board will vary greatly and depends on the hand your have drawn. Sometimes you will end on a Knightmare wall immune to targeting, battle, destruction in hopes of unicorn to draw you 4-5 cards your next turn; sometimes you will end on a basic Orcust loop with two negates and an I:P Masquerena; sometimes you'll end with an Avramax with an Iblee on your opponent. There are many more boards, that I will record later.

Test Hands:

<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/2CFHTKr5cuw"">https://youtu.be/2CFHTKr5cuw</a>

Side Deck

Because I could not fit in every card smoothly, I left them in the side deck as an optional strategy change. Monstrosity ""archetype"" is designed to summon World Gears Theurlogical Demiurgy which is a go second board nuke. Avida Rebuilder of Worlds can also be used to reset your extra deck. A few other World Legacy cards that could use Girsu Krawler combo, or Topological Bomber Dragon board nuke.

I feel bad that I can't give a more in depth analysis, you really just have to experiment with it to figure it out."

https://youtu.be/-4gIvITere4","A deck that I would not know what to say, but that IS VERY STRONG !! I faced him more than 10 times !! and I lost 9 the one that won was because I changed to an Aleister-Shaddoll deck and yet it left me almost lifeless, I won it after much suffering.
The tri-brigade are Exaggeratedly Powerful !! The lyrilusc completed and created this MADNESS !! In my opinion I dare to say! It is currently the strongest deck that I have faced !! And that I use a dogmatika deck that is strong, my friend in the video duel did not run with any other luck there you see All its power See it enter the minute that it is marked and see what I am Talking All in potential of this Brutal deck one good mix.

I made this months ago after the Vampire support came out, but never uploaded it cuz I haven't touched this website in literal months. The side deck is ass ngl, and the extra deck is pretty full so drop whatever you think isn't necessary for combo. Same as the last deck, you want either Shiranui Solitare/Vampire Ghost Ogre/Uni-zombie + Vampire Familiar/Retainer. There are other combos, I just can't be bothered to make and write them down.

<strong><span>Combos:</span></strong>

<strong>God Hand: Vampire Ghost Ogre + Vampire Familiar/Retainer</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Normal Summon Ghost Ogre</li>
 	<li>Activate Ghost Ogre's Effect and discard Familiar/Retainer and mill Retainer/Familiar. Search out Vampire Grace</li>
 	<li>Activate Vampire Familiar in grave and discard Grace to special summon Familiar on field</li>
 	<li>Activate familiar's effect and search out Shadow Vampire</li>
 	<li>Send Ghost Ogre to grave and to activate retainer's effect in grave</li>
 	<li>Activate retainer's effect and search out Vampire Domination</li>
 	<li>Link Summon into Vampire Sucker</li>
 	<li>Banish Ghost Ogre from grave to tribute summon Shadow Vampire</li>
 	<li>Activate shadow vampire's effect to special summon Vampire Scarlet Scourge</li>
 	<li>Chain Link 1: Activate Vampire Grace in Grave to special summon itself , Chain link 2: Activate Scarlet Scourge's effect on summon to special summon Vampire Sucker</li>
 	<li>Activate Sucker's effect and draw 1 card</li>
 	<li>XYZ summon Grace and Scourge into Beatrice (that one fairy monster in the extra deck)</li>
 	<li>activate Beatrice's effect and send Banshee from deck to grave</li>
 	<li>Banish Banshee from grave to play zombie world from deck</li>
 	<li>You should have 4-5 cards in hand so set whatever backrow you have (including domination) and end turn. (I wish I had an idea to do something with shadow vampire)</li>
 	<li><em>Turn</em> 2: During the draw phase/Standby phase, activate beatrice's effect and send doomking to from deck to grave.</li>
 	<li>Standby Phase, activate doomking's effect in grave and special summon itself</li>
 	<li>activate vampire sucker's effect to draw 1 card</li>
</ol>
<strong>The meh hand (I should really make a better combo for this): Shiranui Solitare/Uni-Zombie + Vampire Familiar/Retainer</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Normal summon Shiranui Solitare</li>
 	<li>activate its effect to tribute itself to special summon Uni-zombie</li>
 	<li>Activate Uni-zombie's effect to mill vampire retainer/familiar</li>
 	<li>activate vampire retainer/familiar in grave and send vampire familiar/retainer to grave to special summon</li>
 	<li>(<em>if special summoned vampire retainer</em>):</li>
 	<li>activate retainer's effect to search out domain</li>
 	<li>activate familiar's effect in grave and send domain to grave to special summon</li>
 	<li>activate familiar's effect to search out shadow vampire</li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon Uni-zombie and Vampire Retainer to summon stardust charge warrior and use its effect to draw 1 card</li>
 	<li>Normal summon shadow vampire by tributing vampire familiar and activate shadow vampire's effect</li>
 	<li>use shadow vampire's effect to special summon vampire grace</li>
 	<li>XYZ summon Beatrice with vampire grace and stardust charge warrior.</li>
 	<li>do the zombie world thing where you mill banshee on turn 1 and mill doomking during draw phase of turn 2</li>
 	<li>(<em>if special summoned vampire familiar</em>):</li>
 	<li>search out a vampire monster (doesn't matter) with familiar's effect on special summon</li>
 	<li>send your searched vampire monster to the grave to activate vampire retainer's effect in grave</li>
 	<li>activate retainer's effect to search out vampire desire</li>
 	<li>synchro summon with vampire retainer and Uni-Zombie to make Stardust charge warrior and draw 1 card</li>
 	<li>use vampire desire to change vampire familiar to a level 6 by sending vampire grace to grave</li>
 	<li>XYZ Beatrice with Vampire Familiar  and stardust charge warrior</li>
 	<li>do the zombie world thing where you mill banshee on turn 1 and mill doomking during draw phase of turn 2</li>
</ol>
^this combo needs work

<strong><span>Turn 2/Side Deck:</span></strong>

All the <em>planned</em> turn 2 comes from the side deck.I put the usual Nibiru and forbidden droplet in the side deck. Forbidden droplet since some of the monsters can steal opponent's monsters if they are destroyed by battle. An extra ash ghost banshee and extra zombie worlds in case your opponent is playing a deck that shreads through backrow like butter. Triple Infinite impermeance to have more hand traps. and Finally, the non generic stuff, 1 Extra Jack-o-bolan to help if your normal summon is messed up, 1 Vampire Red baron (this card is super good on turn 2, not so much turn 1), and 1 Utopia beyond to swap out with beatrice or another extra deck monster (I highly doubt any opponent will let you get beatrice's effect off after setting up a turn 1), this monster is good to beat over untargetable monsters while you don't have doomking to carry you.

<span><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</span>

I put way less thought into this deck in comparison to my vampire kingdom deck. Also im writing this at like 12 am. If you have any suggestions, post them below, and if you like the deck, leave a like and lmk you like it by leaving a comment. thanks for reading and enjoy!"

Vampires are my favorite archetype in Yugioh, and it bothered me to see that once vampires got support, everyone immediately concluded to use them in zombie world even though they have their own custom field spell. While I'll admit, Vampire Kingdom sucks, I refused to believe the new support had nothing to help a Vampire Kingdom strategy. So I looked through every vampire card and tried my best to make a deck that could use Vampire Kingdom to its fullest potential (which isn't much). Through my efforts, I found that this deck plays strongest against other zombie decks due to being able to tribute them with sucker, and stealing monsters even with a zombie restrictions. What is listed below is my personal identification of all the cards I chose to use, and their purpose in the deck. After that, I describe the use of basic combos to help you get started. Unfortunately I don't list any 3 card combos since I consider that to be too unlikely to be worth spending time writing down.

<span><strong>Notes/Tips:</strong></span>

-I forget this all the time when I'm playing, GLOW UP BULB AND VAMPIRE FASCINATOR LOCK YOU INTO ZOMBIES. This means you cannot special summon from your opponent's grave AT ALL. You Can't use Vampire Fascinator to steal a monster or use Vampire Bram or use Dhampir Vampire Sheridan to steal. This Restriction is ONLY bypassed if your opponent is ALSO playing a zombie deck.

-Vampire Vamp combos best with Vampire Sorcerer for a turn 2 play. Ghost Ogre is capable of one card comboing into Vampire Vamp if you play these 2 cards together.

-Vampire Bram will summon itself back Every Standby phase if its destroyed in any way. Meaning, if your able to attack with another XYZ monster while thats on the field, you can easily make AA-Zeus with it without giving up any powerful XYZ monsters.

-Vampire Bram and shadow vampire's attack disabling effect can be ignored if you use their effects on Main Phase 2.

-Dhampir Vampire can steal a monster that is sent to the graveyard by any card. This can be by battle, or by a card effect or by its own effect.

-Vampire Fraulein + Vampire Domain leaves you with literally no reason to not spend 3000 LP every time a monster attacks. If you get 2 Domains on field, you'll gain an additional 3k LP per attack on monsters.

-In the event you draw 1 of your combo pieces, and you don't have a search target, Just search out Fraulein or Domination instead.

-In the event you open with Vampire Kingdom on turn 1, activate it, then search out Vampire Awakening instead of Takeover, then either:
A.  Avoid sending Vampire Duke to the grave to special summon from the deck with awakening.
B.  Use awakening to special summon Scarlet Scourge from the deck and use its effect to summon Duke from the grave (to simulate Vampire Takeover's effect).

-Hand traps are really annoying for this deck since a single one can ruin your play, which is why I play so many anti-hand trap cards

-On turn 2, I drop all anti-hand trap andd hand trap cards for board negation cards and kaijus since I don't like running the gamble of ""Maybe I'll draw a hand trap that'll stop their play"". I'd rather have something that can break their board instead. I also drop 2 Vampire Dominations, Crimson Knight Vampire Bram, and Shadow vampire for more board disruption.

-I recommend designing the side deck to your own preference. The only cards I would recommend for the side deck are Vampire Vamp and Vampire Sorcerer.

<span><strong><u>Conclusion:</u></strong></span>

This deck is the deck I worked the most on out of all my decks (still gets bodied by solemn judgment). I'm proud to have made this and surprised that I was able to make use of most of the vampire archetype (RIP Vampire Lord, if only you were better). Regardless, it's pretty fun to play for me. I also think my decision-making when it comes to tech cards is amateur as heck and I'm sure someone else could pick better cards than the ones I chose. I hope someone who's a better deck builder takes inspiration from my deck to make something better, (so I can take it and play it) and hopefully make people a little more interested in the side of vampires no one cares about. (Even tho vampires just got support, I still wish they got a link monster to search takeover). Thanks for reading, leave a like if you enjoyed using the deck or love vampires, or leave a comment if you have any suggestions."

This strategy can be somewhat effective even nowadays against a lot of decks, including meta decks, however competitive decks have now a lot of more consistency than the competitive decks back then, not to mention that we didnt had the handtraps/removal/negates we have today. However, back in 2017, this kind of strategy could really win against the meta, even because the banlist had cards like harpies feather duster banned, dark hole at 2, solemn judgement banned, solemn warning at 1, even thunder king rai-0h was at 2 in 2017. The idea is focused into two main strategies: The first one is based on bring zap mustung and thunder king rai-oh with ties of the brethren, and to potentialize the lockdown it uses denko sekka, contract with don thousand and anti-spell fragrance, so basically if you have these 5 cards face up on the field (and your opponent draw a spell card which at that time was very common), your opponent cant search, cant special summon during their turn (until they attack), they cant normal summon/set and they cant set or activate spell/traps (except traps from hand, which at that time the only one who could actually break this lock was evenly matched). And the second strategy is to swarm monsters on the field with pa/ma for xyz summon and gain advantage with the other members of the family. So what do you think about this strategy? Was this viable at 2017? Is this strategy still viable nowadays?"

Control Variant with good enough OTK potential.

This build uses Enforcer as he has a lot of synergy with Ecclesia (adds back in end phase), Supreme Sovereignity (triggers banish eff), is a great extender, can help to draw cards and is very accessible with 3 Fusion Destiny, 3 Pot of Prosperity, Anaconda, Link Spider.

We are not comboing off in this build, we try to avoid Nibiru, avoid Sphere Mode, Lava Golem etc. by committing less summons.

This build uses 8 handtraps: 3 Ash, 3 Imperm, 2 Droll &amp; Lock Birds. Meta Decks want to go first, we need enough hand traps to stop them. Droll &amp; Lock is really good against all meta decks this November 2021 format (Tri Brigade, Lyrilusc, Drytron, Dragonlink, ...).

We use gold sarc as extender (banish blackout to get a token), instant fusion as extender (SS Ansy tuner lvl 4 fusion) or vs. token collector to SS Thousand Eyes to suck him.

We main deck imperial order because we want to go first and even if we get stopped by opponent's hand traps, Imp Order will shut down many decks from OTKing us. We mainly need a Normal Summon to make our strong Synchros.

&nbsp;

We need to keep in mind that Prosperity will not let us draw with Mo Ye, so we should go for Taia, Enforcer, not do the whole swordsoul combo in the prosperity turn.

We should keep in mind that Longyuan does 1200 burn damage, gold sarc will give us the blackout trap after 2 of our standby phases, ecclesia can add back to hand if enforcer was sent to GY, dasher can SS in draw phase, ...

Dragite should always be used to excavate. Maybe our opponent tries to neg it. We could have Nibiru in deck.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We play 1 Protos in the side deck, this wyrm is searchable with Grandmaster and the Swordsoul Emergence spell. Protos can be summoned easily and shut down Drytron completely by calling light. Light can also prevent Invoked Dogma decks from summoning ecclesia, maximus, fleurdelis, Mechaba, ...

We play Evenly Matched in the side deck because it is a very flexible out vs. most meta decks.

&nbsp;

Weaknesses:

Nibiru, Token Collector, Droll &amp; Lock Bird, Dimension Shifter

Sphere Mode, Lava Golem

Many handtraps stopping the build up: Imperm, Veiler, Ash, belle,...
