If you don't open rituals, you can still do the usual Trickstar shenanigans","I like it when I can play yugioh, I also like it when my opponent can't play yugioh... Well in a way that doesn't seem too unfair... Not FTK or pseudo FTK anyway.  As I read it, the Herald cards can basically negate anything and are not once per turn, but they require fairies to work and low level Herald monsters themselves aren't great, then it came across me that trickstars are decent and they are all light fairies, then I combined the 2 and made this deck, they work surprisingly well together so I thought I should share it.  So Herald of Perfection is our main boss monsters here, our main goal is to negate anything the opponent do and out resource them with advantage generating Trickstars. With a hand of 6 fairies, you can certainly do that. Spell, Trap, Monster Effect, you name it, just negate, negate and negate.  <strong>The basic combo is as follows:</strong>  <strong>1,</strong> you need Herald of Perfection, Dawn of the Herald (Ritual Spell), and Cyber Angel Benten  or alternatively Pre-prep and prep of rituals as they searches the three mentioned above. Extra-foolish will search any one of the three.  <strong>2,</strong> if you have all 3, use Cyber Angel Benten as tribute to ritual summon Herald in defense position(Unless you have honest).  Now active Cyber Angel Benten's search as CL-1, Ritual Spell's effect as CL-2, this will chain block your opponent from Ashing your search effect  However they can still ghost belle you just keep in mind. Cyber Angel Benten's effect allows you to search any light fairy type monster, which is basically entire deck.  Now ritual spell allows you to add  Cyber Angel Benten back to your hand, you now have Herald on field and one search.  <strong>3,</strong> Search targets are usually Trickstar Candina(Your trickstar engine starter if you don't already have one)  Honest(To protect Herald from battle), Eva (Provide more fairies for latter use), Trickstar Lilybell(For GY recovery)  &nbsp;  If you don't have the 3 combo pieces, chances are you have a lot of Trickstar cards, then you can do the usual Trickstar shenanigans, like droll-reincarnation combo. I don't cover it here since you can find those in many other places.  &nbsp;  <strong>Some key cards explained:</strong>  Herald of Perfection: Note this card can only negate activation of cards, not effects, so be sure to negate continuous s/t when they first activates or you can't destroy them later on.  Honest: only run two as you don't really want to see more than one in your hand, two is a great number, help protect herald and run over big beaters.  Barrier statue of Heavens: Side deck tech option, if you facing some danger dark warrior stuff, just search this using Cyber Angel and summon it, they can't really do anything if you also have an honest in hand to protect it.  Eva: You don't want to discard this card first, use some ritual monsters first and then discard this, it allows you to go +2 by adding lilybell and orange light to your hand.  Extra-Foolish burial: dump Herald of Arch light and you can search any of the missing ritual stuff, dump N'tss you can pop a floodgate or problematic monster. Don't use it if you can't get 3 combo pieces complete or want to use the droll-reincarnation combo as you can't set cards after you used it.  Scapegoat: Sadlly at 1 now so when you have it, good make borrelsword and skill them, if you don't, don't be sad.  Pot of Extravagance: You don't go into extra deck very often, so more card advantage is always good.  3 pre-prep: It's a +1, what more do you want?  3 prep: Do not use it to add back ritual spell though, you use it to search both ritual monsters, you only want to summon herald once so getting ritual spell back is often meaningless.  Herald of Orange light: You go -1 but it's important to have, basically a veiler + orge, prevent your opponent from setting up an unbreakable board or summoning a crazy strong boss monster. The other two small Heralds are too situational. Note this card can snipe hand trap as well if you are desperate.  <strong>Some cards I didn't run explained:</strong>  Impcantation monsters: they bricks more often than I expected as we only run 1 summonable Ritual monster here, running multiple Impcantations would brick more often than help. Also when they hit the field, you can't really get them off the field as you can't link them off, thus hindering the use of Trickstar Lycoris and Lillybell.  Hand traps: I side them because if you can get Herald out, you don't really need hand traps as every fairy in your hand become a handtrap whatsoever. The only hand trap I run is Herald of orange light, it's basically an effect veiler + Ghost orge in one. It's also a fairy, so you can use it with Herald of perfection and search it with Eva's effect(Don't search it using Cyber Angel though). However if you go second, swap some ritual stuff for hand traps and going second cards in case your opponent make an unbreakable board.  Herald of Ultimateness:  Level 12 require a lot more resources, the ritual spell doesn't give you resource, it only have 200 more atk and def, can only negate ss, really not worth it for its cost.  Pot of desires: Already running pot of extravagance, don't really want to banish Eva or some of the Trickstars though, as we are not running 3 of everything. Extra deck on the other hand we don't often go into.  Ritual Sanctuary: It's a -1, the field spell itself doesn't do anything and you always prefer light stage, you don't really need this as you have pre-prep which is a +1, card advantage here is important as you are trading resource 1 for 1 with your opponent."

Stall until your have either: Destiny HERO - Plasma &amp; Destiny HERO - Dogma OR Cyber Dragon/Cyber Dragon Core &amp; Flaming Inpachi/Berlineth the Firestorm Vassal, Fusion Gate and Chain Material. You can also replace Cyber Dragon/Cyber Dragon Core &amp; Flaming Inpachi/Berlineth the Firestorm Vassal with other Pyro and/or Machine monsters whom you think will work better.  Link Monsters are for the players who wants to use D End Dragoon, since there's no way you can use Chain Mats' combo into 2 D End Dragoon unless you're not playing Link Format.  I put them in basically because i like to SS a lot, and they kinda will make an OK defence. NOTE: DO NOT fusion summon until your have Chain Material, because if you don't, you'll ruin the Combo. But i guess its your choice. You may not get this deck first try, so do some practise runs.  Once you Fusion and activate Chain Material, your opponent should't be able to activate anything since Chain Mats' effect will still remain until you got no Fusion monsters left to summon, so once you get the combo up and going, basically an OTK from there on ;)."

After the failure of trying to integrate Lair of Darkness cards, I decided to keep it straigh","The third most current version of my Dark Magician deck. After the failure of trying to integrate Lair of Darkness cards, I decided to keep it straight DM and add a little more draw power to the deck itself.  The Eye of Timaeus is a good card and all, but it is a brick that has a lot of potential. So I replaced it with the Keeper of Dragon Magic to build up the number of monsters in this deck that can be normal summoned. Keeper of Dragon Magic and Polymerization can be swapped with the Eye of Timaeus to lower card count and be more direct.  I feel like Torrential Tribute can really do good with Eternal Soul protecting DM. But I don't like the fact that I can still risk losing my cards. So I added 2x Drowning Mirror Force and 2x Mirror Force to the extra deck to be flexible in the event that torrential tribute is not helping. Battle Fader and Scapegoat are the Plan C for this to get a mini-wall out there for linking.  Dark Illusion is a great card IMO that protects almost all your monsters and can even work on your opponent's monsters to stop an effect. I feel it is a hidden gem that isn't known yet for DM. Dark Horizon is in the same boat but is hesitant if it wants to stay or not. It is very good for special summoning any of the Dark Spellcasters, depending on how screwed you are but you have to take the damage in order to use it. Dark Horizon could be very useful for getting out Apprentice Illusion Magician and get DM to your hand or even getting the DM out instead. Dark Illusion and Dark Horizon were meant to be swapped out with each other but could be together for the best coverage.  2x Eternal Souls. I find that 3x is too risky to run and that I will brick more often.  1x Dark Magic Attack for that quick removal of the back row.  Cosmo Brain is the card that I get questioned on. I like that it can become stronger than DM by discarding DM to the GY by 400 ATK and be able to still bring out the DM from hand or deck. Another hidden gem that is well known.  Mana Dragon Zirnitron, another situation like Dark Horizon, is a great card that can bring back Eternal Soul and start up DM domination. The problem I have is it is a possible brick. You have to hope your opponent will make your spell/trap card leave the field to become viable. Possible Side Deck but is up to the player.  Upstart Golbin and the Spellbooks for that draw power. I was thinking of running Wind Witches but feel that Wind Witches could be separated from DM since how good it is by itself."

The reason for <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> in the side deck is to bring out <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> using your opponents Thunder Dragon monsters going second since Dragostapelia requires a fusion monster (Colossus or Titan) plus another dark monster (any Thunder Dragon monster) and they cannot respond to it because Super Poly says they cannot respond to the cards effect.

It's pretty good.","WARNING: this deck must be run with all the cards at the lowest rarity possible. Most of the best cards of this deck are commons and rares so to give it the real shoe box feel, you have to do this. If you're not playing platinum veilers and foolish I will judge you. Don't think I won't know, because I will.  This is a very basic, more budget build of salamangreats. This build is made to go second, and the side is there for when you know you're going first. Also anyone who says one mole isn't standard is wrong. It's a pot of avarice for the deck. Just run one.  There are 4 one ofs that might feel a little out of place. Those being backup secretary, degrade buster, true king agnimazud, and crusadia reclusia. Reclusia and secretary are easy level three special summons that in a pinch can help you get a stallio or can be link fodder. Also Reclusia is thicc af with 2000 defense, so just having her sit there for a bit in you're in a grind game isn't the worst idea. Degrade and Agnimazud (who came up with that name I want them fired) are also great link fodder but are also great for their effects. Buster can banish a monster until the end phase it the monster has higher attack then it, and Agnimazud just banishes a monster from the field or grave no problem. They're also fire so they give with the deck pretty well. if you have a bit more money in your pocket you can swap them out for thanos dragon or infinte impermanence if you please. The hand trap selection is also a little budget. Droll might cost a little bit more then you'd like, but he's one of the best hand traps so don't skip out on him."

To that end, the archetype focuses on initiating multiple Link Summons in quick succession, all while promoting combos that extend the longevity of this style of play, namely through helping the controller amass more monsters in the hand or on the field to use as <a title=""Link Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Link_Material"">Link Materials</a>. The archetype also encourages the controller carefully consider the placement of cards on their field, particularly by emphasizing the <a title=""Linked"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Linked"">linking</a> of Link Monsters with other monsters in order to gain boons via their effects.</p> The archetype's main strategy is the rapid amassing of <a title=""Link Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Link_Material"">Link Materials</a> on the field to Link Summon <a title=""Link Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Link_Monster"">Link Monsters</a>, mainly by using <a title=""Normal Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Normal_Monster"">Normal Monsters</a> as a medium. To that end, several of its Main Deck monsters are Normal Monsters, namely ""<a title=""Beckoned by the World Chalice"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Beckoned_by_the_World_Chalice"">Beckoned by the World Chalice</a>"", ""<a title=""Chosen by the World Chalice"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Chosen_by_the_World_Chalice"">Chosen by the World Chalice</a>"", and ""<a title=""Crowned by the World Chalice"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Crowned_by_the_World_Chalice"">Crowned by the World Chalice</a>"", all of which possess different Levels, Attributes, and Types, and either 0 ATK or DEF.  The archetype's Main Deck Effect Monsters are designed to further this strategy. The first effect of ""<a title=""World Chalice Guardragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/World_Chalice_Guardragon"">World Chalice Guardragon</a>"" allows the controller to send it from the hand or field to the GY in order to negate the activation of a card that targets a <a title=""Linked"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Linked"">linked</a> monster and destroy it, thus offering protection to the controller from threats to the archetypes' Link Monsters. This also places ""Guardragon"" in the GY to enable its second effect, banishing it from the GY to Special Summon a Normal Monster from the GY to one of the controller's zones that a Link Monster points to. ""<a title=""Lee the World Chalice Fairy"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Lee_the_World_Chalice_Fairy"">Lee the World Chalice Fairy</a>"" enables the controller to add a ""World Chalice"" monster from their Deck to their hand if Normal or Special Summoned, assisting the player in providing monsters to Special Summon with the common effect of the archetype's Link Monsters. ""Lee"" also allows the controller to recover it from the GY to their hand if they send a monster from their hand or field to the GY. Both monsters have great synergy with each other as a result, given that the latter can place monsters in the GY in the process of recurring itself, which the former can then Special Summon for the controller to continue their combos."

I do find this build most effective because not only can you use the cursadia engine to help get out big boards, but you can also use ""Crusadia Spatha"" as fusion material to summon ""Dark Cavalry"" because it just so happens to be a warrior monster. the deck is also easy to recover with as well. one of the other things you can do is use ""crusadia draco"" and ""dark magician"" to special summon ""Dark magician the dragon knight"" as well. essentially, the main goal of the deck is to dumb all your spellcaster monsters into the GY so you can summon ""Quintet Magician"" witch can wipe out your entire board. so not only does this deck work fast to disable your opponents board, but it also helps you get out your most powerful monsters. I really hope you guys enjoy this deck. if you have any questions, leave a comment below and I shall answer it."

Of all these effects, some of the most powerful are held by Cursed. Don't be afraid to equip one to an early monster, or to discard one with Tricky, as you can add any Bamboo card you might need to your deck. Also try to take advantage of the combo between Soul and Cursed, activating Soul to make use of it before adding it back to your hand to prevent destruction, and then immediately being able to attack directly to seal the effect.  Also, this deck obviously doesn't run any cards to replace SM when she gets destroyed by battle, so if you want to play it safe and don't want to run synchro monsters as a mandatory element, fire away with taking out Umbreacum and replacing it with SMLV8."

How to Accomplish:  Use the monsters to swarm the field and also use the draw spell cards to thin the deck and add cards to hand. (Info Below)  Monsters <ul>  	<li>Danger! Cards - Use to swarm the field (Especially with Dogman and Nessie) and thin out the deck. (Some monster can be Normal summoned if necessary)</li>  	<li>Dr. Frankenderp - If Emergency Teleport is on hand, use the card and summon this card then activate the effect to draw a card. If not, Normal Summon or Special Summon using Saryuja. (You can only use the effect once)</li>  	<li>Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite - Use it to return an important monster card or Temple of the Kings (Free Monster) if its on the graveyard. (You can only use the effect to Special Summon once) (Extra monster to Normal Summon if necessary)</li>  	<li>Blackwing - Steam the Cloak - Use it to summon tokens (Saryuja can help) and to help a bit on swarming. (You can tribute a card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard) (You can only Special Summon it once) (Extra monster to Normal Summon if necessary)</li>  	<li>Broww, Huntsman of Dark World - If discarded, a card is added (Extra monster to Normal Summon if necessary)</li>  	<li>Shaddoll Beast - If discarded, a card is added (Only once though)</li> </ul> Draw Spells <ul>  	<li>Upstart Goblin - Hand neutral card (Helps with thinning)</li>  	<li>Allure of Darkness - Hand neutral card (Helps with thinning and removing unecessary Dark cards)</li>  	<li>Card Destruction - Card that replaces your entire hand with new cards (DON'T SEND THE 4 MAIN CARDS TO THE GRAVEYARD EVER!!!) (Use it if hand is bad, hand is filled with discard cards or when hand is filled with many cards) (Helps with thinning a lot if in a right moment)</li>  	<li>The Beginning of the End - A +2 card when Graveyard is filled with Dark monsters (7+ Dark cards to be precise) (Helps with thinning and drawing) (Avoid using two at the same time unless the Graveyard is filled)</li>  	<li>Into the Void - A situational Upstart Goblin (When you have 3+ cards in your hand, you can use it)</li> </ul> Other Card <ul>  	<li>Emergency Teleport - Use it on Frankenderp (If Frankenderp is already used, use it as a discard)</li> </ul> &nbsp;  After that, you can go to these Extra Deck cards <ul>  	<li> Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack - Basically, a mini Galaxy Tomahawk. Use it to swarm the field with tokens. (A mini Swarmer)</li>  	<li>Saryuja Skull Dread - Use it to refill your hand with new cards and get rid unecessary ones. (Summon it using 4 monsters [most of the time] unless its really necessary)</li>  	<li>Akashic Magician - Use it to return an important monster (Mostly Saryuja)</li>  	<li>Wee Witch's Apprentice - A two arrowed Link monster that is good for having two Extra Deck monsters (Also a Dark monster)</li>  	<li>Space Insulator - A Link monster that can use any monster for summon (Good when tokens are out) (Also a Dark monster)</li>  	<li>LANphorhynchus - A Link monster that can use any monster for summon and also good for having two Extra Deck monsters (A good card?)</li>  	<li>Link Spider - Good for token renaming (For Saryuja)</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Then, here are the card you need on the field at all times  &nbsp;  Main Cards <ul>  	<li> Reversal Quiz - if the setup is done, use this card to swap with your opponents life points</li>  	<li>Temple of the Kings - use it to immediately activate the trap card</li>  	<li>Wall of Revealing Light - use it to lower you life points as much as possible (but not 0)</li>  	<li>Fuhma Shuriken - Set this on the field and after the setup is done, this will finish of the opponent (almost all of the time)</li> </ul> &nbsp;  The consistency of the can be improved, so you can adjust the deck as much as you want."

Thank you so much for telling me what deck content you guys want and for supporting me. Now I've been fooling around with the Warrior engine a little bit combined with Spyrals. These two go together very nicely since <a data-name=""SPYRAL Super Agent"">SPYRAL Super Agent</a> is a Warrior type monster as well as <a data-name=""SPYRAL Tough"">SPYRAL Tough</a> even though I decided to only put one Tough in the deck. You always want to go first with this deck if possible. A Warrior monster plus a Warrior extender or a Super Agent in your opening hand means you will be able to extra link your opponent if you are going first. Also the deck is crazy because I've made it so you can loop <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a>'s effect multiple times going first to take handtraps and monsters in general out of your opponent's hand so they can't play their next turn and will have to scoop. The way this works is once you summon Dolphin the first time and use it's effect, you can then use it for link material for Isolde and then bring it back out from the graveyard or banished pile with other extenders such as the equip spell, D.D.R, or <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, etc... You can also use Isolde's effect to send four equip spells from your deck to grave in order to special summon <a data-name=""Neo Space Connector"">Neo Space Connector</a> which will allow you to use it's effect to send itself and special summon Dolphin from grave to use his effect again. The other combo to loop Dolphin's effect is using <a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a> in the graveyard to banish Dolphin and another Warrior monster and then use D.D.R to send the Divine Sword you just added to special summon Dolphin again. Then proceed to use Divine Sword again and banish two Warrior monsters and use Dolphin's effect to pitch Divine Sword to take another monster out of your opponent's hand. Another way to pull off this Divine Sword Dolphin combo is using <a data-name=""Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo The Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> to synchro into <a data-name=""Power Tool Dragon"">Power Tool Dragon</a> and use its effect to force your opponent to choose the D.D.R from your deck, and add it to your hand. Then loop the Divine Sword and D.D.R and Dolphin. I've been able to win games on ygopro with just Dolphin's effect going first because I loop Dolphin four or five times and then they can't play because they don't have the monsters they need to go off into their combos in their hand anymore. The deck can brick sometimes, but I believe I have made it the as consistent as it can possibly be made. The brick ratio I would say isn't too high but sometimes it can happen. I will now explain how to extra link your opponent. Firstly, you need to summon two Warrior monsters and go into <a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights</a>. Then use her effect to send four equip spells from deck to grave to special summon a Super Agent or Tough from deck, then you should be able to go into <a data-name=""Summon Sorceress"">Summon Sorceress</a> with Isolde and another Warrior monster besides Super Agent and use her effect to special summon another Super Agent or Tough and then use those two monsters to go into <a data-name=""SPYRAL Double Helix "">SPYRAL Double Helix</a>. Then you can use Double Helix to special summon <a data-name=""SPYRAL Master Plan"">SPYRAL Master Plan</a> and use her effect to add <a data-name=""SPYRAL MISSION -  Rescue"">SPYRAL MISSION -  Rescue</a> from your deck to hand. You can also use Dolphin's effect to send Rescue to grave as cost and use Rescue later. The next step is to go into <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> using Summon Sorc, Double Helix and Master Plan. If you don't already have <a data-name=""SPYRAL Resort"">SPYRAL Resort</a> on the field then go ahead and set a spell/trap you don't need from your hand facedown before you summon Unicorn, and use Master Plan's effect and Unicorn's effect to send Rescue to grave to shuffle that card you set back into the deck, or if you do have Resort on the field already then shuffle Resort back into the deck instead of a facedown spell/trap in your hand you don't need. Then use Rescue in grave to banish itself to special summon Master Plan back to use her effect to add another Rescue and go into <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a> using Unicorn and use it's effect to send that Rescue from hand to grave and special summon <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a> from the deck. And now you can link into <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> using Master Plan and Iblee right under Mermaid. The idea is just to keep looping Rescue and the <a data-name=""SPYRAL MISSION - Assault"">SPYRAL MISSION - Assault</a> in the deck to keep special summoning Master Plan and/or other Spyral monsters from grave and use <a data-name=""SPYRAL Quik-Fix"">SPYRAL Quik-Fix</a> to get <a data-name=""SPYRAL GEAR - Big Red"">SPYRAL GEAR - Big Red</a> to loop Master Plan an addition time. At the end of all that special summon looping, end with Quik-Fix and use it to make <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> in the other link zone, completing the extra link. It will be impossible for your opponent to get over this unless they main <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> or Ra Sphere Mode which is unlikely. Games two and three its best to make <a data-name=""Trigate Wizard"">Trigate Wizard</a> and co-link it times three so you can negate their Evenly Matched if they try to use it on you during their following turn after you go first. You can even use Summon Sorc to special summon Quik-Fix from the deck after summoning Power Tool Dragon since Power Tool is a Machine type monster and so is Quik-Fix. I did consider going second as an option if you don't win the rps or dice roll while building this deck from scratch of course! That's why I added <a data-name=""Crusadia Arboria"">Crusadia Arboria</a> to the deck as an extender, because not only is it a Warrior type monster and a free special summon, but it's a tuner which means you can go into <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> to wipe your opponent's board going second. I also added <a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of The Ice Barrier "">Brionac, Dragon of The Ice Barrier</a> to deal with annoying boss monsters like <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a>. With Brionac's effect you can send Rescue or Assault from your hand to grave which is really helpful. You can also use Destrudo to go into Brionac or Black Rose Dragon which is really helpful or if you don't have it you can summon Arboria off Isolde's second effect! There's just so many cool combos I came up with while building this deck and overall it's a really fun deck to play and most of the time will win if you go first.

This deck is a lot of fun to play and can win you tons of games against all the meta decks if you play it right. The deck always wants to go second and the goal is to go into <a data-name=""Crusadia Magius"">Crusadia Magius</a>, then <a data-name=""Crusadia Regulex"">Crusadia Regulex</a>, then <a data-name=""Crusadia Equimax"">Crusadia Equimax</a>, and use <a data-name=""Crusadia Maximus"">Crusadia Maximus</a>'s effect to deal double damage with Equimax.

But before using it, read the combos and more below:  Combos (To get Red Dragon Archfiend on Field):  Red Resonator + Red Sprinter (Red Sprinter + Red Resonator works as well. Just make sure you control no monsters when using Red Sprinter first): Summon Red Resonator, then use it's effect to Special Summon Red Sprinter. Then use both to Synchro Summon Red Rising Dragon. Use Rising Dragon's effect to bring back Red Resonator. Then Synchro Summon again to become Red Dragon Archfiend.  Any Level 2 Resonator + Red Warg: This one is easy. Summon any Level 2 Resonator (Force or Red Resonator), then you should be able to Special Summon Red Warg, which should then lead to Red Dragon Archfiend.  Beyond Red Dragon Archfiend:  Any Level 8 ""Red Dragon Archfiend"" + Chain Resonator + Any Level 3 Resonator: This deck contains two Level 12 Synchros. One requires the original Red Dragon Archfiend while another doesn't. The steps are the same. With a Level 8 Red Dragon Archfiend Synchro Monster, summon Chain Resonator. Use it's effect to Special Summon a Level 3 Resonator (Clock or Dark). Then with there combined levels, tune them with a Red Dragon Archfiend to create either ""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity"" or if using the original Red Dragon Archfiend, you can go for ""Red Nova Dragon"".  Red Rising Dragon + 2 Level 2 Resonators (Red or Force): I haven't tried this one, so I don't know if it will work, but you can try. You Synchro Summon Red Rising Dragon using the above method, then instead of going to Level 8, wait until you get another Level 2 Resonator (If it's in the Graveyard, cards like ""Red Carpet"" and ""Resonator Engine"" could work). Summon the 2nd Level 2 Resonator and you should get ""Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend"".  Red Rising Dragon + 2 Level 2 Resonators (Use 2nd Resonator after Synchro Summon with Red Rising): (Easier version of above) Summon a Level 8 red Dragon Archfiend Monster, then use the 2nd Level 2 Resonator to get ""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane"".  Any Level 8 Red Dragon Archfiend Synchro Monster + Chain Resonator (Don't need to use Chain's effect): With a Level 8 Red Dragon Archfiend Synchro, summon Chain Tinker and bring out ""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"".  &nbsp;  <strong>NOTE:</strong> <ul>  	<li>If you noticed, I used one original Red Dragon Archfiend and used more of Hot. That's because the original's first effect kind of mocks me. How monsters that don't attack are destroyed isn't helpful. This may make summoning Red Nova Dragon hard. You can add two more copies of it if you want, this is just my opinion</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The Continuous Trap ""King Scarlet"" can also be used with a Level 8 Red Dragon Archfiend Synchro Monster for ""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss""</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>I found ""Synchro Cracker"" to be very useful and fun to use. By sending a Synchro Monster you control to the Extra Deck, you can destroy all monsters your opponent controls that are weaker than the Synchro's ATK. Since a lot of cards in this deck have really high ATK power, you can use it to destroy almost all of your opponent's monsters (Like a King)</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>King's Synchro is also a good trap if you want to add</li> </ul> &nbsp;  That's all.

  <h2><span class=""mw-headline"">Playing style</span></h2> The ""Salmangreat"" monsters have various effects related to battle and <a title=""Graveyard"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Graveyard"">GY</a> recursion. A common theme among many of their monsters is they work best when with another monster of the same name. The most simple and powerful example is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Gazelle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a>"" who sends any ""Salamangreat"" card from the Deck to the GY, and can also Special Summon itself from the hand if a ""Salamangreat"" monster is sent to the GY. Many of the archetype's effects also involve shuffling cards from the GY into the Deck and discarding cards, so manipulation of the GY successfully gives the Deck a lot of potential.  A key part of the Deck's combos is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Sanctuary"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sanctuary"">Salamangreat Sanctuary</a>"", which allows the player to use a ""Salamangreat"" with the same name as a monster being Link Summoned as the entire material. As with the lesser monsters, the boss monsters get stronger when Summoned using a monster with the same name, making ""Sanctuary"" the quickest and easiest way to open up the full potential of the Deck's Link monsters. It can be searched by ""Salamangreat Balelynx"" to increase consistency.  The main win condition of many builds is to set up a ""<a title=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Violet_Chimera"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a>"" Summoned using another copy of itself, which basically guarantees an <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""OTK"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/OTK"">OTK</a> if all its effects resolve. The other Extra Deck monsters are dedicated to supporting this strategy, or for supporting the Deck's recursion/battle effects. The Deck's Ritual Monster ""<a title=""Salamangreat Emerald Eagle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Emerald_Eagle"">Salamangreat Emerald Eagle</a>"" provides a finisher/alternate attacker that can clear all the opponent's Special Summoned monsters if Ritual Summoned using an ""Emerald Eagle"" the player controls, and can sacrifice unneeded Link Monsters to get over tough monsters while inflicting heavy <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Burn"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Burn"">Burn</a> damage.  As any modern Deck must, the Spell/Trap lineup of the Deck also has a heavy control element. ""<a title=""Salamangreat Roar"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Roar"">Salamangreat Roar</a>"" is a powerful <a title=""Counter Trap Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Counter_Trap_Card"">Counter Trap Card</a> that can negate any monster effect or Spell/Trap card while you control a ""Salamangreat"" Link Monster, that can Set itself from the GY when a ""Salamangreat"" is self-Link Summoned at the cost of banishing itself when it leaves the field. It can also be recovered by ""<a title=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sunlight_Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a>"", who can also play a key role in grabbing ""<a title=""Fusion of Fire"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_of_Fire"">Fusion of Fire</a>"" or other key Spell/Trap cards. Many of these get stronger when a self-Summoned Salamangreat Link Monster is present, so maintaining and protecting a powerful monster like ""<a title=""Salamangreat Heatleo"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Heatleo"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a>"" can reap many rewards, even over a relatively short Duel.  Finally, a key step in setting up these plays is ""<a title=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Miragestallio"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a>""  </div>   "
