&nbsp;

for years, THE PHANTOM KNIGHT has been a lame engine as you have to banish all of them to activate their clumsy effects and spam the field, <em><strong>BUT NOW EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE THE SAME! </strong></em>

as you now have access to ISEKAI SHIELD HERO/REDO OF THE HEALER <strong>DECK STRATEGY</strong>

&nbsp;

<span>This engine focuses on leaving the field with a griffon (for negation effect and destruction of 1 card) unchained abomination (for destruction of 1 addition after griffon negates and destroy something else) 1 phantom knight sword for negations, 1 ash blossom/impermanence or an aditional sword of phantom beasts, and 1 destiny hero destroy phoenix enforcer on the field on turn 1. this full combo <strong>lets you control 5 cards of the opponent on turn 1!</strong> this full combo requires 3 lvl 3 monsters on hand, something that you have 26% odds of this happening on first hand as you have 27 cards that give you access to a lvl 3 monster, this means that 1 of 4 duels guarantee a full field control  but <strong>FEAR</strong> not!</span>

&nbsp;

you can always end with a griffon, unchained, and a phantom blade, thats 3 cards down, this you can do it with 2 lvl 3 monsters. the odds of this happening are 41%, thats almost a 1 of 2 duels that <strong>you can end with 3 negations at all moments</strong> as the odds of drawing 1 level 3 monster are 64% and down at 1% every turn. this means that<strong> in all duels</strong> you have you will always have a 1/2 chance of drawing a lvl 3 monster, something that will basically help the deck to<strong> NEVER</strong> end of resources and combinations.

&nbsp;

this deck is <strong>simply stupid</strong> as you can just if your field is broken, end the game with the XYZ dragon as you end with a 10000 atk monster on your field to end the duel! and if that doesn't work, don't worry you still have access to appolousa, avramax and underworld goddess!<em> check it out!</em> as you can win competitively against anything <strong>BUT BE CAREFUL</strong>, the deck is prone to <strong>lose to side deck</strong>, so, make a side deck against side deck options, as t<strong>he perfect counter for this deck</strong> is not nibiru, is token collector, artifact lancea and dimensional shifter.

Nothing special but I think it's extra filthy in some aspects so that's why the name. If I can improve it do comment yeah."

A fantasy RPG party has assembled, and it's orders are... ASSAULT MODE ACTIVATE!!!","An otherworldly hero saves the world with the Dragon that represents Yusei's willingness to risk his own life to save his friends! Welcome to Brave Stardust Assault mode! These two decks (+ other engines) create the ultimate RPG party to defeat the demon lord (your opponent lol)!

Now with the recent semi-limit of “Emergency Teleport” as of the latest banlist, every “Assault Mode” strategy obtained a power boost with an excellent additional starter. Comboing up to this deck’s boss monster - Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode just became much easier with Brave Token’s “Wandering Gryphon Rider’s” omni-negate. Gryphon Rider, summoned before the Assault Mode combo insulates the line from handtraps and other disruptions.

This harmonious mishmash of cards functions like a mix of combo/control. Going first, this deck ends on several synchro boss monsters and various interruptions (strength of 1st turn board is hand dependent) and going second, this deck can play through interruption and OTK in a heartbeat by generating 8000+ damage by swarming the field - clearing the board with bounce and destruction effects.

This deck is made out 4 separate archetypes/engines.

<span><strong>ASSAULT MODE PACKAGE</strong></span>

The Assault Mode cards adds an extra layer of power to Stardust Dragon, transforming our favourite signer Dragon into a once per turn omni-negate 3000ATK beatstick! The starter for this engine is Psi-Reflector, and it singlehandedly eventually summons this deck’s main boss monster, Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode.

Since Psi-Reflector is the key card, this deck has maximized ways to summon it. x2 Emergency Teleport, x3 Assault Sentinel (searches for Psi-Reflector after tributing), x3 Psi-Reflector itself), x1 Tenki and x1 One for One. That’s a grand total of 10 ways to get Psi-Reflector on the field, Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode a very consistent card.

Once you get Psi-Reflector on the field, search for Assault Beast. Discard Assault beast to get Assault Mode Activate, and use Psi-Reflector’s other effect to summon Assault Beast from the GY. Psi-Reflector modulates Assault Beast’s effect to 7, and you tune the two monsters together for Stardust Dragon! Set Assault Mode Activate, and use it next turn to summon Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode!

<span><strong>BRAVE TOKEN PACKAGE</strong></span>

Brave Token kinda functions as 7 extra copies of “Called by the Grave” or “Crossout Designator.” Wandering Gryphon Rider provides an omni-negate before the 5th summon, allowing the player to play through blowout handtraps like Nibiru. If the Brave Token package successfully baits out a negate, interruption or handtrap, it successfully did it’s job – you can combo off as usual with your other engines. This package searches for it’s starter Rite of Aramesia, then the card eventually gets your Wandering Gryphon Rider out as an omni-negate.

This package has 7 copies of Rite of Aramesia –  x3 Rite of Aramesia itself, x3 Aquamancer of the Sanctuary, and x1 Foolish Burial (Target is Aquamancer which banishes itself to search Aramesia).

Rite of Aramesia activates Journey of Destiny from deck, and it in turn searches out a Brave Token monster. The usual target is usually Wandering Gryphon Rider. It also searches out Brave Token equip cards: Dracoback the Dragoon Steed (targeted bounce), and Noble Arms of Light – Dannel (Attack boost, can be cut out of the deck if needed).

Be aware that if a normal summoned monster uses it’s effect, you cannot activate Rite of Aramesia! On the flip-side, if you use Rite of Aramesia, you cannot use a normal summoned monster’s effect (like your Assault Mode starters Psi-Reflector and Assault Sentinel)!

<span><strong>DOGMATIKA PACKAGE</strong></span>

This package is optional, you don’t have to use it in this deck. I like it because once Stardust Dragon is out, Ecclesia can get you free extra bodies on board or interruption. Nadir’s Servant is an incredible card just gives soooo much relatively free advantage, momentum and destruction as well! This deck does not summon much from the extra deck after completing the Assault Mode combo, so not being able to summon from the extra deck using this package isn’t too bad of a downside. Going first, this package provide interruption and going second, it breaks apart boards.

This package is composed of 7 cards in the main deck (x3 Ecclessia, x3 Nadir’s Servant, x1 Fleurdelis) and x3 cards in the extra deck (x1 Titaniklad, x2 N’tss.) Feel free to add the Shaddol cards to this package as well, I didn’t include them because space in this deck is limited already.

Feel free to swap this out for other packages, handtraps, or staple cards!

<span><strong>ASCATOR PACKAGE</strong></span>

This is the smallest package in this deck composed of only four cards – x3 Ascator, Dawnwalker and x1 Fire Ant Ascator. Unlike the other packages which all have their grindgame and interruption, the Ascator package functions only as an extender, granting it’s user level 8 synchro in exchange for a discarded card. Discarded cards ideally are members of the Brave Token package, since they usually like being sent to the GY. The best generic level 8 synchro target for this engine is Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. In a pinch, this can summon Stardust Dragon as well, if your Assault Mode Package fails.

&nbsp;

With the great variety of different packages this deck features, it’s boards greatly vary. The strength of your first 5-6 cards generally determine the strength of your board. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/Yf7EfgA""><span><strong>HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF THE BOARDS THIS DECK CAN MAKE:</strong></span></a>

As you can see, this deck functions as a grindy control deck that can play/extend through interruption. Each separate engine adds it’s combat style to this RPG party. Assault Mode brings out a big boss monster with an omni-negate. Brave Token clears the field, extra ATK on board, and an omni-negate. Dogmatika provides destruction, extension, extra ATK on board, and a monster negate. Ascator brings out a free level 8 synchro.

While it prefers to go first, this deck can go second, breaking apart the board with cards Nadir’s Servant and Dracoback while extending through plays through 4 engines that provide card advantage (kinda like Dragon Link.)

<span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span>

Ever since the archetype “Brave Token” came out, I kept brainstorming different ways how to utilize the engine with various archetypes, since I’m such a big fan of Fantasy RPG. With this deck, I feel like I’ve created a working RPG party that is ready to adventure through whatever the meta throws at it! 5Ds is also my favourite Yugioh series (after Duel Monsters), so unironically playing Stardust Dragon in a semi-competent deck has a special place in my heart.

Despite the praise I’ve showered on this deck, Brave Assault Stardust is probably only a middling rogue strategy at best, and Brave Token is more optimally used in stronger meta decks like Phantom Knights or Prank Kids. However in my humble opinion, nothing beats the COOL FACTOR of adventuring with a fantasy RPG party with Stardust Dragon to defeat the demon lord (The opponent lol. Forgive me, I’m a big nerd with an overactive imagination)!!!

CHANCES TO WIN WITH THAT ARE LOW! BUUUUUUUUUT NEVER 0!!!!,"<span><strong><span>This Deck is 100% not for competitive use. Fun only.</span> </strong><span><em>(But if you do end up winning anything, pls tell me!)</em></span></span>

You can theoretically win with this, but it's 1) incredibly hard and 2) it isn't meant for winning. It's meant to have a few laughs with your friends. If you want to have an actually viable deck, check out one of the other ones i made.

If you got any feedback just tell me in either the comments or on Discord (<span>Tobi#5733</span>).

Now having read that you may think to yourself:

""What in the world am i supposed to do with this piece of ssssshhhhhhhhh!?!?!!?!?!?""

Good question! I mean i would've prefered it if you didnt swear but still.

<span><strong>Now, what are you supposed to do with this?</strong></span>

<span>There are actually a couple ways in which you can play this deck. One would be to just keep flooding the board with monsters and tokens while doing direct damage with the <a data-name=""Cauldron of the Old Man"">Cauldron of the Old Man</a>. You can also troll a bit with <a data-name=""Marshmallon"">Marshmallon</a> and <a data-name=""Snowman Eater"">Snowman Eater</a>. You pretty much want to play almost everything in face down defense position so that your opponent never knows which is which and what he can actually attack and what he has to destroy with his spell and trap cards. But hey, if that's not your style or you just don't want to play the long game, go for an XYZ, Link or Synchro Summon. <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, <a data-name=""Raider's Knight"">Raider's Knight</a>, <a data-name=""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"">Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> are great options and are easy to bring out. They really require almost no setup whatsoever. Having only 4 Tuners in your deck tho means that it's way harder to get to your synchro monsters. Especially <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>. It is still possible. Just like i said, really hard since he's a level 8 Synchro Summon and you only have level 2 and 1 tuners.</span>

<span>The Deck is still WIP so i will change thing's around. I'm really unsure about the three <a data-name=""Smile Action"">Smile Action</a>s for example.</span>

<span>Also this is just a deck i was able to build with the cards i own. So if you're thinking ""Hey wait, why doesnt he use that card instead of this one???"" it's most likely because i dont own that certain card.</span>

i decided to make a deck that if played, would make a player disowned by the yugioh community so the name Hieratic is really fitting here.

Basically you set up doing some Hieratic plays, set traps for control and pass then completely refresh your hand with trials (I didn’t know this card existed until the new system came up on this site that lets me search by effect, I searched draw and found it) and rejuvenation, it’s entirely control and hopefully will be really annoying to play against. Here’s my reasonings

Prep of rites helps to grab benten more consistently so you can still use other searches for your fairies for your orange lights. Honest is to pair with Draconids for an instant OTK as long as the person you are playing against doesnt have a way to stop your attack (this is just a back-up play if you get stuck). The honest can also be used with orange light so it is useful either way. Extra deck can be any variation you want (eg, Accesscode and Zeus, Dragoon, all 3 if you wanna flex).

My version runs all the Drytron monsters (except Beta) at 3 of, but you can change the balance of those to fit your playstyle to make room for other cards like Herald of Purple or some hand traps."

This deck is a Heavily modified version of a deck on YouTube(<span>YuGiOh! LOTD Link Evolution - Barian's Over Hundred Numbers</span>) about the CXYZ 100s Numbers with Barain Hope.

<span>THE KAISER:</span> The main Strat for this deck is to bring out two more monsters for the XYZ summon of utopia double, then use its effect to bring out Utopia Kaiser, which is the only way your bringing out Number 107 Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon(A good beat stick) and its Chaos form Number C107 Neo Tachyon Dragon(Good for securing a lot of damage with its effect to negate and prevent the activation of cards, be mindful that if you have Barain Hope you'll be removing its effect of gaining ATK based on its Overlay Units so don't for get all the time like me.)You'll probably be able to summon another monster if things go right and if you get lucky and draw a Zexal Field/Construction you can add extra Overlay units to the Kaiser, which will let you summon up to three monsters from the extra deck; I usually go with Tachyon Dragon(as mentioned earlier), Battlin Boxer Star Cestus and if you get that extra summons from Zexal Feild, Number C103 Ragnafinity. You wont be able to summon anything else after using The Kaiser so make sure to XYZ summon before using it, Number 104 Masquerade is the best option in my opinion but summon what ever fits the situation.

<span>THE MONSTERS:  <span>The Main cards you'll be XYZ summoning with is usually going to be the Onomat Cards(Zubabancho, Dodododwarf  and Utopic Onomanpoeia.) Goblinbergh and Tin Gold Fish support by bringing in more materials on the field, most of the time before the main Onomat combos and SZ - Ascend Sage will bring more constancy with the rank up cards for the as well as being able to special summon itself if there are no cards on your side of the field.</span></span>

<span>THE SPELLS:<span> The cards Onomatopaira, Onomatopickup(searches for the Onomat Cards) and Zexal Construction(Searches for the Zexal/SZ cards) are to help with the constancy in this deck. Though the Zexal card also has another use, to search for the Zexal card, Zexal Construction must send a card back to your deck, you can use this to your advange if you drew both of your Double or Nothing cards or if you wanna send Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One if you happen to draw it on your first turn.</span></span>

<span><span>      Rank-up-Magic(RuM) Limited Barain' Force and Quick Chaos mostly the best RuMs for this deck, since RuM Barian's force is worse unless your opponet has XYZ monsters, RuM Admiration of the Thousands effect hardly ever gets a chance to activate and RuM Numron Force Negates your all your face up Cards effects(this'll fuck with Barain Hope if you use it while its out.) I haven't used RuM Argent Chaos Force yet but I'll test it out and I might write about it later. Also Rum The-Seventh-One gives some good Heart of the Cards vibes when you draw it in a clutch.</span></span>

Zexal Field is a very useful for its ability to add more Overlay units to a XYZ Summon as well as providing a bit of protection for your XYZ monsters , but you must handle it with care or you could remove a lot of potential options for yourself. By adding cards from your Extra Deck to your XYZ monster you remove the possibility to XYZ summon it or to bringing it out with The Kaiser, and if you add a card from the graveyard, Barain Hope wont be able to copy it's ability anymore since that card is now an Overlay unit. Though, if a card is completely unavailable though XYZ summons or the Kaiser(Neo Galaxy Dragon being trapped in the extra deck due to Tachyon Dragon being destroyed before it could be summoned with RuM Quick Chaos/Resurgam XYZ), you can use Zexal field to put it into an XYZ monster and when that monster is destroyed or used in a Card effect, it will become available for Barain Hope to Copy.

Resurgam XYZ is just kinda there since it's Rank-Up XYZ related and Double or Nothing is required for Utopia double/The Kaiser to work.

<span>The Extra  Deck:<span> Im getting tired so Ima summarize the monsters fast.</span></span>

<span>Number 39: Utopia</span><span>:</span> good utility and if you get Ascend Sage Mid duel, you can draw a RuM card from your deck.

<span>Number 39: Utopia Double</span><span>:</span> Used to bring out the Kaiser.

<span>Number 93 Utopia Kaiser</span><span>:</span> The center of the main strat for this deck, really good beat stick.

<span>Number 101: Silent Honor Ark:</span> It's a decent option if you have extra materials on the field and want another XYZ monster, good monster removal.

<span>Number 103: Ragnazero: </span>A more replaceable card for this deck, it's effect is not allways usable like the other monsters on this list but its only uses 2 level 4 monster for it's materials so it's nice if you want an XYZ monster but you want to save a Utopia summon for later with Ascend Sage and if you don't want to or unable to summon Silent Honor Ark.

<span>Number 104: Masquerade:</span> This card has a very good effect, being able to negate monster effects is really good to keeping your Monster and spells safe. It's second ability can also come in handy sometimes.

<span>Number 105 Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus:</span> It competes with Masquerade for the monster that needs 3 materials to summon so its not a great option in comparison. I usually just summon it with the Kaiser. Although, if this card is in the graveyard and Barain Hope copies it's ability while it only has a little bit of Overlay Units; it can do some good damage against opponents with super big beat sticks or take out some opponents who are low health with monster effects protecting them.

<span>Number 107: Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon:</span> You bring this out with the Kaiser and rank it up next turn and sometimes copy it's effect with Barain Hope. Not much to say.

<span>Chaos Numbers:</span>

<span>Number C101: Silent Honor Dark:</span> Really good card on the field and great affect to copy with Barain Hope, it's ability to attach opponents special summoned cards to itself then summoning Barian Hope on top of it is a really good move, and by itself its just a strong card and one of the best Monster on this list.

<span>Number C103 Ragnafinity:</span> I've never gotten that much use out of this card... It mostly just attach it to The Kaiser with Zexal field and call it a day. It's affect seems pretty decent though but its the same as it's non Chaos counter part in that it's use doesn't come up as often.

<span><a data-name=""Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade"">Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade</a></span>: Being basically a direct upgrade to a good card in this deck, this Monster, to say the least, is great. Also it's basically the only backrow removal in this deck so use it wisely.

<span>Number  C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cetus:</span> It's propose in this deck is similar to its Non Chaos Counterpart so there's nothing really new to say. I also usually summon this with Kaiser.

<span>Number C107: Noes Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon:</span> A powerful card to say the least, it's a really good beatstick and it's card effect is good a securing wins at the end of games if you have a lot of XYZ monsters on your field, though try to remember that it's effect negates Barain Hopes ATK gaining effect, so don't be like me and use it while Barain hope is on the field

&nbsp;

<span><span><strong><span>CXYZ Barain Hope</span></strong></span><span><span><strong><span>:</span></strong></span> The Card that's in the title of the deck, it's can serve as both a beat stick and powerful utility. This card your only gate way to access affects of XYZ monsters that have been destroyed, its also able to become a the strongest beatstick in the deck with enough overlay units. I love this card for the creativity and strategy it want you to use, copy Masqurade to protect yourself form card effects, copy battlin' boxer with little to no overlay units to surprise your opponent with unexpected battle damage, copy Silent Honor Dark to become even stronger while also remove cards from your opponents field, god dam I love this card.</span></span>

&nbsp;

<span>Side Deck:<span> Number wall is iffy protection for your numbers since if your opponents also has a number its kinda useless, it just doesn't feel as useful as it seems. Summoner Monk is a great card but I often have to choose between a spell I need or to use Summoner Monk's effect. Number 102 and C102 are difficult to use since you have to use only light monster to XYS summon 102 and C102's really good effect is locked unless you have 102 as an overlay unit, the card effects are good, just hard to use. Im unsure about Memories of Hope since it's only good if you have XYZ monsters on the field, but I guess you do usually have XYZ monsters on the field, I'm just not sure how many cards are right.</span></span>

I would appreciate if you could suggest card in the comments and thanks for reading my brain vomit about my favorite cards"

<span>It's a bit cheaper than dragonmaid cards but very powerful and easy.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Ok, the goal of this deck it’s simple, get a wall of high dmg monsters with negations, needs a bit of luck sometimes because handtraps can fuck our combo so hard, but we can still having a pair of manor combos with which we can survive a pair of extra turns.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Now I’ll try to explain how to play the basic and more large combo of this deck. Looks easy but it’s risky and very very close, we cannot change many plays of this combo.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>We only need 2 cards “<a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a>” and “<a data-name=""World legacy Guardragon"">World legacy Guardragon</a>” + 2 more cards in hand to drop or something like that.</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li><span>Everything starts with a Normal summon, <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a> invocation, after that we must use his effect, sending him to the graveyard, making us take from the deck a lvl4 Dark dragon monster, Technically we should take a <a data-name=""Black Dragon collapserpent"">Black Dragon collapserpent</a> but if we got him on our hand  nevermind take a Rokket Tracer we can special summon it later with Boot sector launcher. </span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ok, we got a <a data-name=""Black Dragon collapserpent"">Black Dragon collapserpent</a> in our hand so what’s next. The next part is obviously summoning him, banishing <a data-name=""Starliege Seyfert"">Starliege Seyfert</a> from our graveyard. </span></li>
 	<li><span> Now use it to summon a <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> from our extra deck. When <a data-name=""Striker Dragon"">Striker Dragon</a> is link summoned you can search in your deck a <a data-name=""Boot sector launcher"">Boot sector launcher</a> and put it in your hand. Now <a data-name=""black dragon collapserpent"">black dragon collapserpent</a> was sended to our graveyard from the field. We can add to our hand a <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>.</span></li>
 	<li><span>As we do with Seyfert, we banish Collapserpent from our graveyard to summon <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyverburster"">White Dragon Wyverburster</a>. Now we must use our <a data-name=""Striker dragon"">Striker dragon</a> and our Wyverburster to Link summon a <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight-Romulus"">Dragunity Knight-Romulus</a>. </span></li>
 	<li><span>When Romulus is Link summoned we can search in our deck a <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a> card, and add that one to our hand, activate that motherfucker magic card as he touches our hand couse now is when the thing goes hottest as fuck. With <a data-name=""Dragon Ravine"">Dragon Ravine</a> activated we can send a card from our hand to drop from our deck a dragon monster aaand what we want to drop to the graveyard? Correct, a fucking and gorgeous <a data-name=""Abosrouter Dragon"">Abosrouter Dragon</a>, when this mf is sended to the graveyard we can add a Rokket monster from our deck, and this ma boyz is the moment, we must add a <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a>, do you remember the <a data-name=""Boot sector launcher"">Boot sector launcher</a> we add to our hand? well activate da shit, special summon at least 1 <a data-name=""Rokket tracer"">Rokket tracer</a> (if u got another rokket monster you can special summon it with Tracer) with <a data-name=""Rokket tracer"">Rokket tracer</a> on the field we have to activate our <a data-name=""World legacy Guardragon"">World legacy Guardragon</a> to special summon a lvl4 dragon monster from our graveyard, and who’s there? a fucking White Dragon Wyvernburster, but not too fast ma boy, as soon as se touches the field we have to use it to link summon a <a data-name=""Guardragon Pisty"">Guardragon Pisty</a>.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span><span>With Pisty on the field and using the second effect of the Fucking <a data-name=""world legacy Guardragon"">world legacy Guardragon</a> we move his ass under <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight-Romulus"">Dragunity Knight-Romulus</a> is to make a wombocombo with their making Pisty activate his second effect special summoning a mf <a data-name=""White Dragon Wyvernburster"">White Dragon Wyvernburster</a>. Now don’t be too fast, cause we MUST TO USE Pisty and Romulus </span><b>(at least but never use 1 <a data-name=""Rokket Tracer"">Rokket Tracer</a> or <a data-name=""White dragon Wyvernburster"">White dragon Wyvernburster</a>) to another link summon, this link summoning it’s only used to send Romulus to the graveyard, if you can link summon a lvl4 link do it cause we only wants that a rate 2 Link in our graveyard.</b></span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Now we must have on the field a Link, a Wyvernburster and a Rokket tracer, with these last 2 monsters we have to do a synchro summon, <a data-name=""Borreload savage dragon"">Borreload savage dragon</a> should be our choice.

So this is a control-based deck that grinds your opponent out, your interruptions are usually just Spheres, Sheou and tidying.</span>

<span>• There's also going second cards like super poly and veiler so you can break their boards, but you could honestly cut veiler for forbidden chalice because it can stop vw, tri-brigade and other decks plus forbidden chalice is cheaper. It's just a nice 1 for 1. Rivalry is a great tech for this format since it can stun most of the meta decks out and solemn warning is a nice alternative for solemn strike. The reason why you run Noctovision Dragon is that it's a nice extender that let you dig deeper in the deck and is a target for changeover. It's the same reason for World Legacy Guardragon, but it also lets you link climb into Pisty which could lead to an otk with borrelsword. </span>

<span>• The side is completely changeable, it mostly depends where you play and in what format. I chose what would be best for the format in my opinion. Santa Claws are probably the spiciest one out of them, it's a cheaper alternative for kaijus and not too big that I can't beat over. I hope the rest is pretty explainable by itself.</span>

This is just the first wave of support and the deck is already pretty good at putting up Towers +3+ interruptions.,"I kinda scoffed at Beetrooper at first, but when people figure out how insane these combos are this deck is gonna see play. New support in the near future is exciting, but what are we playing with right now? You're basically Insect Link Combo, putting up easy endboards with several quality interruptions in a combination of Monster Negates, a Counter Trap, and a lot of searchable hand traps.

Let's go over the deck. Cut it down to 40 cards by shrinking my packages down. It doesn't have as high a ratio of anti-hand trap tech this way, but in exchange, you get more consistent Resonance Insect starts. Seems fair.

So, for starters, we're running 3 Resonance Insect. This plus 1 extender is full combo, and the combo uses all three copies to search 3 times and send 1 time often for a fourth search. These are broken, and are the reason the deck is OP. You want to open this card, and you want at least 1 of your normal summons to be this card when you play out your plays. It is searchable with Gokipole and Retaliating ""C"", and can be equipped to monsters with Picofalena, so you always find 1 throughout your combos.

We're running the Battlewasp engine. Sting the Poison is a good starter - this plus an extender is a decent combo, since you search Arbalest for your extra normal summon with Armor Horn. It also puts a negate on the board when resurrected with Seraphim Papillion or Cicada King, and searches a follow-up in the process, so it is a very good engine to run.

We've got a full playset of Scout Buggy. This is usually the least important starter, it does lead into Armor Horn by itself, but it is more relevant for being special summoned with Invincible Atlas to make Cicada King. Still worth running the 3. You will banish these, but since copies summon from the hand, deck, or GY you want to leave redundant copies in the deck. Very powerful card, a combo piece, and a half-decent starter.

Next onto extenders. 3 Scale Bomber. These chain-block summon effects like Scout Buggy and Sting the Poison, provide an easy extender, and actually represents an additional interruption if you have enough extenders in your hand. 3 Pin the Bullseye and 1 Twinbow the Attacker are generic extenders and Battlewasps to search with Sting the Poison. Twinbow locks you into Insects, but so do your Link monsters which you make early in your combos. You mostly just summon insects so this restriction is not super relevant. We have 1 Monster Reborn. This represents an additional trigger for Resonance Insect sometimes, and while it doesn't combo off with just 1 starter it is a great high-quality extender late into your combos, so I think it is worth it to run. The search off Retaliating ""C"" is also not once per turn, so this is relevant with Monster Reborn. We have 2 Ready Fusion. We run 2 because it is sacky in multiples, and because we run a single Instant Fusion in the deck. That just about does it for extenders.

Beetrooper Sting Lancer is sort of an extender, sort of a hand trap, and definitely an engine card. Number one use for this card is summoning it with the Link 4, but you'll often search the second copy to your hand for more disruption, and when you summon the second copy on your opponent's turn it adds a follow-up. It's a little bit worse going second, but it can also represent an extra (very good) extender when you get hand trapped going first. I think 2 is the right number, I often summon 1 and search the other in my combos. 1 of the Field Spell, for follow-ups and the grind game (it's a decent extender late into your combos and helps keep a Beetrooper on field for the counter trap.) Lastly we run 1 Fly and Sting, the searchable recurrable Solemn in Archetype.

Gokipole is another engine card, but it's actually pretty good to Normal Summon, and fun to discard to Picofalena, so you never mind seeing this card. It is a hard once per turn, so you only get the 1 search off of this card a turn. It can add Retaliating ""C"" in some of your combos, and it adds Resonance Insect in others. You can equip this when you're out of Resonance Insect for more searching. It can also add Aztekipede for an extender, and can summon Killer Needle when you are going second to get an extender and break boards. Doom Dozer is another important card in the deck, but you can summon the one copy multiple times in your combos so you only need 1 (if you see the one, that's great - search something else high level!).

For Hand Traps we have 1 Retaliating ""C"". Pretty good against most strategies, provided they summon using the effects of a spell. Not a knockout in every matchup, but it is searchable, and it is quite good against some of the meta decks, and has applications against rogue decks as well, so you need 1. It can also help with your grind game by being equipped with Picofalena. If Max ""C"" comes back this card will be even more important and worth running a second, especially since the effect is not once per turn. The searching off this card is good, but I think you only need one, since you can shuffle it back into the deck from the GY and then add it again in your normal combos, using this to represent an extra Resonance Insect in your combos basically. We also have 1 Contact ""C"". It is searchable with Resonance and hits tribal decks pretty hard, and can even be searched with Retaliating ""C"". 1 Gadarla. It's searchable, and you need another high-level interactive monster to search for in your combos. Kaijus actually seem pretty good right now, and having the 1 of to search outs a lot of stuff rather nicely. We then have 1 Ash, 1 Ghost Belle, 1 Nibiru, and 1 Imperm. If the Mega Tin isn't out yet you can run more impactful hand traps, but post that you want to run Crossout Designator, and these are the 4 most important hand traps to protect against IMO, just by virtue of 3 of them being very commonly played and the 4th hitting you hard. There are more hand traps in the side deck for games 2-3. Lastly we have 3 Crossout Designator, 1 Called By The Grave, and 1 Instant Fusion for Millenium Eyes Restrict. Beating hand traps is good, and since our deck does require a lot of resources to go in to get them out, beating those hand traps is important. Instant Fusion is also our third copy of Ready Fusion for all intents and purposes, being the final generic extender.

In the extra deck we have some goodies. 3 Armor Horn. When the new support comes out I could see cutting this back to 2, but every copy of Armor Horn you have in the deck improves the grind game of the deck a lot, so right now I'm on all 3. 3 Inzektor Picofalena, these are essential to your combo. They're basically Union Carrier stapled to Pot of Avarice for insect monsters, and you can use that shuffle effect to have insane grind game. I see playing 3 of these as mandatory for your grind game, and so that you can use 2 in your combo going first sometimes, and I'll likely try and fit 3 in even if the new support it really good. We'll see. 2 Invincible Atlas. This is a combo piece and also your main boss monsters, you use this to help put up your final interactions and then leave it in the Extra Monster Zone as this Towers that people have to find an answer for. You could just run 1 and use Picofalena to shuffle the second back into the deck, but I like running 2 for now. You have 1 Seraphim Papillion, you want to make this at the end of your combos with Armor Horn and Sting Lancer (usually) and you want to revive Battlewasp Sting the Poison and in a pinch Scale Bomber to put up extra interruptions on your opponents turn. 1 is fine, you can shuffle it back if you need to and you don't make this turn 2 pretty much ever. 2 Cicada King. Again, Pico could shuffle the first copy back, but I like making 2 of these in a game, and this way Pico can focus on other more important cards. It's a negate, but it actually often represents 2 interruptions thanks to reviving Sting the Poison (or Scale Bomber). We have 1 Accesscode. You'll sometimes be able to make this, but honestly it's not usually where you want to be. It's good for now. 1 Almiraj. Sometimes you just need to use Resonance to search something, lame, but it comes up. Then we have the Fusion targets, Hercules for being and insect, and Millenium-Eyes to protect against hand traps.

Moving on to the side deck, we have an assortment of hand traps, partially for Crossout but also to increase hand trap density in games 2 going second. We have 1 Tri-Brigade Revolt for Crossout as well. It is an extra brick, but being able to use Crossout to shut down Revolt is pretty big in the matchup. We have 3 DRNM, because we want to be able to play the game going second. We have some assorted stuff for backrow, including Pankratops, always flexible. And then we have the 1 Killer Needle to push Gokipole going second.

One thing I want to point out about the deck is that the combos are very flexible. Sometimes it will be correct to summon Doom Dozer twice in a turn in order to build up more interactions, other times you pathway to the most effective plays are to try and search out as many hand traps as possible. You can even discard a hand trap you want to search, like Gadarla, shuffle it back into the deck, and then search it again very reliably. Speaking of, Gadarla is very good. The deck lacks tools to break boards, but easily puts up a lot of good interaction. However, Verte Anaconda can help a lot of those combo players break through your negation by summoning Dragoon, which can then pop what's left of your board, and force you to decide between crashing into it or giving up Atlas' protection on the follow-up. Right now Contact ""C"" is probably better, and since Sting Lancer represents an interruption that grabs you a follow-up it is sometimes the correct choice, but if you know you're in a Dragoon matchup search the Kaiju. Contact ""C"" is actually pretty good against a lot of decks that run Dragoon, for forcing them to go into Dragoon, which you can out. Also, even if your board gets broken you often add enough follow-ups throughout your combos to just rebuild turn 2, so even if they crash into Atlas after poping your board you're in an okay situation. When possible don't search Retaliating ""C"" with Sting Lancer. Generally Retaliating ""C"" is either very good or basically a dead card, and when it is good Sting Lancer is pretty redundant. You can search it when you know spell starters are played, Rokkets, Virtual World, Drytron, etc. It won't be as good against Tri-Brigade now that Tenki is at 1 and Barrage is banned. Lastly, a lot of people write off Scale Bomber's interruption, but when possible don't use it as material, leave it on the field. This will usually be the correct choice for putting up the highest number of interruptions. Don't be afraid discard the Counter Trap to Pico - while ditching an insect is often the better choice (so that you can use Picos second effect), in a pinch this will protect your card advantage, and might be the key to searching the relevant interruptions in your matchup. Also I'm hearing people say in combo tutorials ""Leave Resonance in the GY"" off of Pico's effect. While this is correct when you're going for Doom Dozer combos, when you're trying to maximize your searches it is often correct to shuffle the second resonance back into the deck to draw a card. This secures your follow-ups, letting you use one Resonance in your combo turn 2, since your first send of Gokipole is relevant when you don't see Gokipole, and your second send of Sting the Poison is relevant for setting up a negate on board, but your third send is irrelevant. If the deck gets some good GY enablers this may change, but for now I'd prioritize shuffling 1 Resonance back into your deck for the full combo.

<strong>Combo #1</strong>

So the combo I want to showcase is the Resonance Insect + 1 Extender combo. For our purposes, we're going to use Twinbow the Attacker.

So you normal summon Resonance, and extend with Twinbow (this locks you into insects, but that's not relevant)

Link them into Armor Horn. Resonance Insect Effect, add Doom Dozer

Banish Twinbow and Resonance to summon Doom Dozer

Resonance effect, send Gokipole. Gokipole effect, add your second Resonance Insect.

Armor Horn effect, normal summon Resonance.

Now you link Resonance and Doom Dozer into Picofalena. Pico equips Armor Horn with Resonance Insect, Resonance Insect searches a hand Trap, let's say Sting Lancer.

You could use Pico to draw a card here, but sometimes that messes up with your GY resources, so for the purposes of this tutorial you don't want to do it.

Link into Invincible Atlas. Resonance Insect effect adds hand trap number 2, so lets say that it is Contact ""C"". It could also be a Kaiju.

Banish Resonance + 2 others to summon our Armor Horn again. Resonance sends Sting the Poison.

Invincible Atlas effect, tribute Armor Horn. Here you have a choice. If the counter trap seems good you can summon Sting Lancer. However, since Sting the Poison is in the GY, you can summon Scout Buggy. Scout Buggy Summons a Scout Buggy and make Cicada King in Defense mode.

So our end board just looks like 1 interaction and 1 boss. However, Cicada King summons Sting the Poison for a second (ish) interruption while adding follow-ups, Sting Lancer does a D.D. Crow impression while adding a follow-up, and then you still have 2 cards in your hand plus potentially a draw off of Pico, plus Contact ""C"" or a Kaiju. The combos actually do get crazier from there, and there are games where I've got a hand full of interruptions at the end of my combo.

<strong>Combo #2</strong>

For this one you need Sting the Poison + 1 extender. For our purposes, let's show off Scale Bomber.

So you normal summon Sting the Poison, chainblock its effect summoning Scale Bomber. With its effect, you add Arbalest the Rapidfire.

Link 2 into Armor Horn

Armor Horn effect, normal summon Rapidfire.

Rapidfire effect, special summon Sting the Poison from your GY.

Link 2 into Inzektor Pikofalena, discard 1 card, equip Armor Horn with Resonance Insect.

If you discarded an insect you can shuffle it and everything but Sting back into the deck with Piko to draw a card. This also sets up follow-up plays, but isn't essential to the combo.

Link 4 into Invincible Atlas

Resonance Insect effect, search a hand trap (usually Sting Lancer, sometimes Contact ""C"" or a Kaiju)

Banish 3 Insects from the GY, including Resonance Insect, to summon Armor Horn to the field

Resonance Insect sends Gokipole, which adds Retaliating ""C"".

Invincible Atlas tributes Armor Horn, and either summons Scout Buggy to make Cicada King if Sting is still in the GY, or Sting Lancer to add Fly and Sting.

So your final Board is Atlas with 1 or 2 negates, and at least 2 hand traps, and you only used 1 Resonance Insect to do this. You also naturally search either ""C"" monster throughout this combo.

Note that while this represents the basic routes through the combos, these are also not the peak of the deck. At its best it searches for 5 cards in a turn while putting up Atlas plus 1 or 2 negates.

&nbsp;

This deck is gonna be real, so learn the matchup now before it gets big. I'm not too sure what support Konami intends to release to help this archetype in the near future, but if even half of the new cards are playable it could make the deck a whole lot better. However, it seems really good as a rogue deck in the meta, putting up Towers + several interruptions fairly consistently once you learn the routes. The amount of searching in the deck is incredible, since you can search out multiple Level 5 or higher insect monsters, potentially multiple EARTH monsters with 1500 or less atk (right now we're not built to really capitalize on that but if Retaliating ""C"" becomes really good we could play more) and also once per turn we can search any level 4 insect throughout our normal combos. That's a lot of really generic searching, and there's plenty of decent insect support that exists. Cocoon of Ultra Evolution is a card I think could make it in some situations, if you want to summon weird Insect maindeck boss monsters, or search Resonance Insect an extra time, but I found it not useful enough as an extender to make the cut in my pure list. Still, any 1 strong insect maindeck boss monsters could make that card a viable option. Multiplication of Ants looks good on paper, but actually doesn't help with some of your main combos, so you can skip it.

Some things to look out for with the new support - Maindeck boss monsters (thanks to Coccoon of Ultra Evolution) could change the deck pretty substantially, since on its own Cocoon is mediocre as an extender, but if it searches out an absolute boss it would be worth occasionally having to burn up Scout Buggy. If Maxx ""C"" comes back it is a hit against the deck, as we are a combo deck, but also good for the deck since it is highly searchable in it, meaning more Maxx ""C"" for us. This deck would actually like Maxx ""C"" at 1. since then you could search it, but you wouldn't have to play against it as often. I actually think Maxx ""C"" formats would help the deck in terms of solidifying its gameplan going first and second, and would make Crossout better. Any tools that can help break boards could be pretty substantial for the deck, since it struggles a little bit going second. This is especially true of any extra deck boss monsters, which the deck is sorely lacking. A resource-generating Rank 3 Xyz is something to be on the lookout for in the archetype, since the deck easily makes rank 3s. Any Beetrooper that can Special Summon an Insect from the GY would help. Lastly, one thing that would help the deck a lot are any high-level insect hand traps that get printed, since some hands can search 4 high-level hand traps but there are only 3 (playable) that currently exist, Contact ""C"", Kaijus, and Sting Lancer.

Down to 1 Gokipole. It is an okay starter card in the deck, and it is brickier when you run 1, but I wanted the space to bring back in Called By the Grave to the main. I also put Meteonis Drytron into the side deck for the Drytron matchup."

Spellbook (drawing engine)

Mythical beasts (summon negate &amp; monster negates)

Endymion (spell &amp; trap negates &amp; synergy w/MBs)

The main deck involves several going first or second options, and can utilize the side deck accordingly after the first match. The ""going first"" board is usually ending with two or three negates in the form of Odd-eyes Vortex Dragon (summoned using the effect of Odd-eyes Absolute Dragon), Endymion, The Mighty Master of Magic, Mythical Beast Jackal King and Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess. You can also end with a Secret Village of the Spellcasters up if you draw into it or Terraforming, as well as a Mythical Beast Garuda in hand, which can use three spell counters to negate the special summon of a monster, on SS2.

The following segment shows how to use all of the engines (It's worth knowing that they are in order of importance/the order you will use them in a duel, this is also going first)

First, Mythical beasts. If you opened Mythical Beast Master Cerberus, as well as Mythical Institution, then go ahead and activate Institution. Then activate Cerberus in the pend scale and use it's effect to pop itself (sending it FU to EX deck) to add one Mythical beast to hand. If you opened Jackal King as well, then search Garuda. If not, get the Jackal King. Then use Jackal King in the pend scale, which pops itself to special summon a face up Mythical Beast monster from your EX deck (Cerberus, which can be linked away for gravity controller to free up the EX MZ). At this point, you should have 4 counters on Institution, as it gains 2 spell counters every time a Mythical Beast blows itself up for it's pend scale effect. If you didn't open Spell power mastery (to add servant) or Servant of Endymion, use institution's effect to add Servant to hand. It's imperative that you do not use any Endymion pendulum cards if you wish to use any Mythical beast pendulum effects, as they shut off if they're not the only card in your pend zones. A high Endymion scale (8) works just fine with the Mythical Beast's 4 for summoning 5-7 (which includes Mythical Beast jackal king (lvl 6), and both Endymion TMMOM and Reflection, both 7). At this point, you will want to move onto using your Endymion cards:

The only Endymion card you won't really want to use in the pend scale (unless you're desperate for a high scale or a singular spell counter) is Endymion (TMMOM) himself. His pend scale effect is cool and all, allowing you to use 6 spell counters on your field to special summon itself, and then target and destroy as many cards as you can on the field, up to the amount of cards you control that can hold spell counters (then giving himself the same amount of spell counters as the amount of cards destroyed), but it's a bit of a win more card. His negate is returning a face up card with a spell counter that you control to the hand, to negate the activation and destroy a S/T and then gain the spell counters the bounced monster had (Giving him targeting and destruction immunity from ONLY your opponent's cards). The real MVP's of the deck are Servant, Reflection, and Magister. They all share the effect that they can use three spell counters to special summon themselves from the pend scale along with another monster you can place a spell counter on from your deck (servant's effect), your hand (reflection's effect) and face up from your extra deck (magister). You'll want to put them in the pend scale now, preferably Servant + Magistus or Magistus + Reflection. Keep in mind that all three of these cards can only be special summoned once per turn (which bites you in the a** at the worst points in duels). Then use your spellbook draw engine:

The spellbook engine consists of just 4 cards, Spellbook magician of prophecy, Spellbook of knowledge, Spellbook of secrets, and Crowley, the first propheseer (in extra deck). Depending on the combination drawn, activate Secrets, add Magician, normal Magician and add knowledge, then use knowledge on magician for +2 (as well as +4 counters to all your face up MB monsters and + 2 counters to your endymion scales). Or, Magician for secrets, secrets into knowledge. You can also use crowley for the same thing, if you don't draw the right cards at the start. FYI, Knowledge doesn't work on pendulum spellcaster monsters, as they get sent to the extra deck instead of the GY, where it needs them to go in order to +2

Finally, you'll want to get all your special summons (servant, reflection and magister) and link summons done (such as apollousa, BLS, BS dragon), then pendulum summon as many negates back to your field (being Endymion and Jackal king). It's best to try and get as much usage out of your pendulum summon as possible. The Odd-eyes vortex from absolute combo is simple, Xyz summon Absolute dragon using Endymion and Reflection, then link it off for Mekk-Knight Crusadia or Apollousa, then activate Odd-eyes Absolute's effect, which special summons vortex from the extra deck for free. Don't forget about reflection's effect to bounce both one card you control (with a spell counter) and a card your opponent controls to hand upon it's special summon. This is super handy for putting either Magister or Servant back in your hand to put them back in scale after they've used their effects. Speaking of, Magister has an insane effect, that, during your opponent's turn, you can burn 3 spell counters to special summon a spell counter monster from deck... Pretty crazy!

This deck is incredibly strong, being able to butt heads with some pretty powerful meta contenders, but due to the inherent weaknesses in pendulum-based strategies, brought about by the banning of Heavymetalfoes Electrumite, and master rule 5, it's unfortunately not as strong as decks like VWs or Drytrons. Keep an eye on these cards, however, as they have unbelievable potential!"

The only thing that varies is the battle effects.

Montage Dragon can end games and easily get 9000 ATK but you probably won't see it much in your hand unless you add Pot of Prosperity (don't recommend).

A lot of search spells. The only spell that can search Montage Dragon is Piri Reis Map but the downside is a turn without any card effect, so just use piri reis to search timelords.

The side deck is filled with floodgates.

Resume: Don't count on Montage Dragon and abuse Timelords effects.

Easy deck hf.

<div class=""engagement-panel-content-wrapper"">Our prayers had been finally answered. As for the first time ever, we get real support for the gods themselves. However one thing is to be clear: the boar named ""Gullinbursti"" is possessed by Freyr (the god of fertility), and made by the sons of Ivaldi. To it's dismay, the golden boar is very effective at what it is suppose to do (special summon from Hand, and recover a Nordic monster from the GY). Not to mention that since it is a beast monster, it fits well in the Tri-Brigade package that offers expandable ways to get to Thor or swarm your board. The reason that there isn't a whole lot to say about Ivaldi though, is because he himself just searches a Nordic relic on Summon (or special summon if you control a Nordic monster). The Tri-Brigade package fits well with Thor's branch of the Nordic/Aesir archetype as not only they are capable of synergy with the Nordic Beast; but also speak for themselves as they did what they always do best. To my surprise, the real MVP of the Tri-Brigade archetype this time around was ""Rugal the Silver Sheller"". What he does basically is Special summon a (beast/beast-warrior/winged beast) monster from your GY during your opponents turn. This is very effective as to say that you have the new Nordic Relic (Svalinn) on the field, and Thor in your GY; this gives you the opportunity to tribute one of your Nordic beast to your GY to special summon Thor from your GY. As for the rest of the deck, ""Tri-Brigade Revolt"" still holds title as the most situationally important piece of the deck. However this time, I included a Sky-Striker toolkit due to the importance of a card called ""Sky-Striker Mecha - Eagle Booster"" (a card which basically protects your monsters from everything that isn't a Kaiju for a turn). Also included is Triple Tacitcs Talent as hand traps are still the forefront cornerstone to modern Yu-Gi-Oh antics (plus Draw power and hand information is bretty important). For the Extra deck, there isn't whole much to say about it as nothing really changed outside of adding in Thor and Gullveig to the Extra Deck for the Nordic engine to take its course.</div>"

The deck want to go second most of the time.

My aim was to make a very budget but superfun deck and, trust me, the deck is really really fun.

I know that the deck can be improved but the card needed to do that are quite expensive and I don't think is worth.

If y0u watch only the decklist you can think that there are too many 1x and 2x and not enough 3x but I have reached a strange equilibrium and the deck work 7 times out of 10.

The deck want to go first, if you go second is much harder.

It's a deck based on the structure deck lair of darkness but improved to increase consistency.

The deck is NOT competitive, my aim was to create a decklist that it's new player friendly and can be built without spending a lot.

It's amazing for challenging your friends because you can tribute their boss monsters very easily and with the virus trap you can break their hand.

In a local you can win sometimes but don't have too much hope to win the tournament without a lot of luck.

I know that there are better card for the deck but I wanted to minimize the cost as much as possible.

If you prefeer, you can substitute the two trap trick and metaverse with an additional copy of the other traps.

I like playing also nine-taled fox instead of voivode vampire and dark armed dragon instead of mana dragon zirnitron.

All comments on the deck are welcome, sorry for the english is not my main langauge."
