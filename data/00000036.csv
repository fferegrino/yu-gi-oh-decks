I know it's 60 in the main but feel free to bring it down to a normal 40 depending on preference.,<p>This is my build of a bringing together of Blue-Eyes and Albaz/Branded. I only came across Branded archetype recently and it's pretty clean and Blue-Eyes has been my boy for years now so this was kinda entertaining to test with some friends.&nbsp;</p><p>The main moves are to do the usual Blue-Eyes combos with Jet and the White Stone paired with Albaz's ability to recycle itself into its many fusions. Good luck.</p>

I will also go into how to use the future Diabellstar support at the end of the video. If you want more resources on how to play the deck, I recommend checking out the links in the description below. It has everything from a Combo sheet, to various topping deck profiles, to the Rescue ace discord who have been very helpful in aiding me with this profile.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We can break down the general game plan of Rescue Ace into three main points. First we should look to combo out with Hydrant, Air Lifter, or Emergency. This means using Rescue Ace Turbulence&rsquo;s set 4 plus whatever extra deck shenanigans the build is running. Second we have amazing tools to hand trap the opponent. Not only with generic staples but also with Rescue Ace Impulse which tributes itself from hand as a quick effect to fetch us any Rescue Ace from the deck. This can be as simple as Rescue ACE Fire Attacker for some quick draws or something like Rescue Ace Fire engine into Air Lifter or Hydrant for some hand fixing.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you want a more board breaking build consider replacing some staples with You choice of board breakers. Kurikawa, Dark Ruler, and Harpie&rsquo;s Feather Duster come to mind. Lastly the deck ensures wins through it&rsquo;s absurd grind game. Fire Attacker and Decode Talker Heatsoul put a lot of cards into your hand. Rescue Ace HQ is a complete reset and draw after you first Turbulence effect. And all of the other Rescue Ace effects are still really good at grinding.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">It is also important to remember that Rescue Ace&rsquo;s strategy inherently loses to blowout cards such as Lighting Storm, Harpies Feather Duster, and especially Evenly Matched. As such each build seeks to counteract this in it&rsquo;s own unique way. Iblee builds give an opponent a card to lock out opponent&rsquo;s from the effects, Cyberse establishes a spell/trap negate through Cyberse Desavewurm, and Rank 4 builds establish An omninegate through Therion King Regulus.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;EMERGECNY + Monster Combos</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Standard Turbulence Set 4</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So lets get into combos with the basic Turbulence set up. Emergency and any Rescue Ace monster will let us summon Rescue Ace Hydrant from the deck. Hydrant will then let us search Rescue Ace Turbulence. Turbulence can then banish out two cards in graveyard for his special summon, then turbulence get&rsquo;s his set 4 from the deck. There are options for what to set but typically it&rsquo;ll be CONTAIN, EXTINGUISH, and RESCUE for disruptions. As well as ALERT for extension.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;IP:Masqueana + Set 4</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We can levy this previous set up into more disruptions, by using the ALERT we set to search Rescue Ace Preventer. Hydrant lets us activate it the turn it was set. We can then summon Preventer by banishing the alert. Then we can link off the Turbulence and Preventer into IP:Masquerna. Typically this helps somewhat for playing around evenly, since we can condense our board with Apollosa if they try to go to battle phase. But it also gives use access to Knightmare Unicore for flexible removal. You don&rsquo;t have to condense the board if you think Preventer + Turbulence would be more helpful</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Rescue Ace Hydrant Combos</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Decode Talker Heatsoul</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">With just a Rescue Ace Hydrant in hand out combos get a bit more limited. The combo you&rsquo;re likely to do here is to make Decode Talker Heatsoul. Normal summon Hydrant. Use Hydrant to search Prventer. Link Hydrant off into Salamangreat A&rsquo;lumiraj. Banish Hydrant to summon Preventer. Link Preventer Plus Alumiraj into Salamangreat Sunlight Wulf. Use Preventer&rsquo;s when sent to graveyard effect to revive Hydrant from banish zone. Summon Hydrant In Sunlight Wulf&rsquo;s zone to add Preventer back to hand. Link off Hydrant into Linkuriboh. Link Sunlight Wulf and Linkuriboh into Heatsoul. Then you have an extra draw to try and find a hand trap or some way to unbrick.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Decode Talker Heatsoul is a very important option because he&rsquo;s so easy to make. You can make it off emergency and any Rescue Ace monster or just an Air Lifter. Heatsoul plays into the grind game aspect of the deck and is benefited by how many hand traps builds run.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Rescue Ace Air Lifter Combos</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Decode Talker Heatsoul</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Here&rsquo;s the Just Airlifter line for Heatsoul. Airlifter search Emergency. Use emergency to summon Hydrant tributing Airlifter. Use Hydrant to search Turbulence. Turbulence banishing grave to summon him. Have turbulence set the 4 main cards. CONTAIN, EXTINGUSIH, RESCUE, and ALERT. Activate alert using Hydrant and search Preventer. Summon Preventer banishing ALERT. Link Preventer and Turbulence to make Salamangreat Sunlight Wulf. Special Airlifter using Preventer&rsquo;s when sent to graveyard effect. Link Hydrant into Linkuribo. Link Linkuriboh and Sunlight Wulf into Decode Talker Heatsoul.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So using Turbulence as a base to go into Preventer we can realistically do an absurd amount of combos. Building of this we can even summon Iblee from the deck off of one card.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Iblee Lock</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level3 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Wingdings; mso-fareast-font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&sect;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Do note that this combo is possible with just hydrant in builds running Binary sorceress and G Golem crystal heart</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Airlifter search Emergency. Use emergency to summon Hydrant tributing Airlifter. Use Hydrant to search Turbulence. Turbulence banishing grave to summon him. Have turbulence set the 4 main cards. CONTAIN, EXTINGUSIH, RESCUE, and ALERT. Activate alert using Hydrant and search Preventer. Summon Preventer banishing ALERT. Now here&rsquo;s the difference. Link summon into Puzzlomino the Drop and Deleter and then use Preventer to summon back Airlifter to the zone Puzzlomino points to. Use Puzzlomino&rsquo;s effect to change Airlifter&rsquo;s level to two. Overlay Puzzlomino and Airlifter into Gigantic Spright. Use Gigantic Spright to summon Knightmare Conductor Iblee from the deck. Link Iblee and Gigantic Spright into Beat Cop from the Underworld. Activate Iblee&rsquo;s effect when use as link material to send it to the opponent&rsquo;s field. Lastly use Beat Cop&rsquo;s effect to put a token on the Iblee. This will protect it from destruction once.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So here we have a special summon lock that can&rsquo;t be outed by a singular destruction and it prevents Lighting Storm and Evenly Matched. You can see why I favor this build.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Hydrant + Preventer / Air Lifter + Emergency</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Mudragon + Turbulence</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The last major combo is how to make Mudragon of the Swamp in order to give targeting protection to Turbulence. This is important because some players will wait out your plays to go for it. Mudragon forces this out.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Thes easiest way to get to this combo is through Air Lifter and Preventer. Summon Airlifter then search Emergency. Use emergency to summon Hydrant tributing Airlifter. Use Hydrant to search Turbulence. This time we&rsquo;re going to lead with Preventer. Summon Preventer Banishing Air Lifter. Link summon Proxy F. Magician using Hydrant and Preventer. Use Preventer&rsquo;s effect in grave to summon back Air Lifter. Use Proxy F. Magician&rsquo;s effect to fusion summon into Mudragon using both it and Air Lifter. Activate Mudragon changing himself to fire type. Now you can summon Rescue Ace Turbulence from hand without fear of being Infinite Impermanence&rsquo;d.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This combo can also be done with Preventer and Hydrant, as well as with Air Lifter and EMERGENCY. You have a ton of options with this one. Just understand it takes a good player to figure out when to play it safe with Mudragon vs when to extend with Iblee lock.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Deck List</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">My deck list is a bit of a middle ground as far as Rescue Ace builds go. I&rsquo;m running the standard core. Which you can see here. 3 of every starter, 2 each of the combo extenders, and 1 each of out hand trap extenders as well as out search targets. In the extra deck, which is where most of the spice comes from, I&rsquo;m running the Iblee Lock package, the Heatsoul Package, and the Mudragon package. TBH though the Heatsoul package is basically generic to most Rescue Ace Builds.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">My main deck is the filled up with with 3 Ash blossom and 3 Infinite impermance. Along with Resuce Ace Impulse this brings us up to 9 hand traps. Good odds to draw off of Heatsoul or just in general. Especially after setting 4 cards from deck and doing our combos.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m also running 3 Book of Eclipse and 3 Book of Moon. Board breaking is tough and these cards are excellent this format and in general to be honest.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This build has amazing power, great combos and fantastic flexibility as we can se from the before mentioned combo&rsquo;s. This builds weaknesses should be noted. First up is consistency. It has only 10 guaranteed starters which gets bumped up to about 15 with some cards working conditionally. I haven&rsquo;t had that much of a problem with it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad call to take out the Called by the Grave and throw in 3 Pot of Prosperity.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Second this build can still struggle with blowouts. If you play to timidly you will be vulnerable. Use you judgement and create boards to deal deal with an oppoen&rsquo;ts likely options. Make Iblee lock when you can. Make IP:Masquenra to conduse boards. And use REINFORCE to try not neg as hard on value. It will be rough, but you have the tools to fix it.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Side Deck</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m not going to go in depth on side deck options, but I recommend putting in at least Droll and Lock bird as well as Nibiru.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you&rsquo;re going first you can side out two copies of impulse and even potentially Fire Engine. Mostly though you&rsquo;ll be changing out the disruptions and hand traps that don&rsquo;t work in a specific match up. Like Book of Eclipse or Infinite Impermanence. I recommend following current trends for side decking.""</p>"
