I know it's 60 in the main but feel free to bring it down to a normal 40 depending on preference.,<p>This is my build of a bringing together of Blue-Eyes and Albaz/Branded. I only came across Branded archetype recently and it's pretty clean and Blue-Eyes has been my boy for years now so this was kinda entertaining to test with some friends.&nbsp;</p><p>The main moves are to do the usual Blue-Eyes combos with Jet and the White Stone paired with Albaz's ability to recycle itself into its many fusions. Good luck.</p>
