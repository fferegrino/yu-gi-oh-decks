I know it's 60 in the main but feel free to bring it down to a normal 40 depending on preference.,<p>This is my build of a bringing together of Blue-Eyes and Albaz/Branded. I only came across Branded archetype recently and it's pretty clean and Blue-Eyes has been my boy for years now so this was kinda entertaining to test with some friends.&nbsp;</p><p>The main moves are to do the usual Blue-Eyes combos with Jet and the White Stone paired with Albaz's ability to recycle itself into its many fusions. Good luck.</p>

I will also go into how to use the future Diabellstar support at the end of the video. If you want more resources on how to play the deck, I recommend checking out the links in the description below. It has everything from a Combo sheet, to various topping deck profiles, to the Rescue ace discord who have been very helpful in aiding me with this profile.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We can break down the general game plan of Rescue Ace into three main points. First we should look to combo out with Hydrant, Air Lifter, or Emergency. This means using Rescue Ace Turbulence&rsquo;s set 4 plus whatever extra deck shenanigans the build is running. Second we have amazing tools to hand trap the opponent. Not only with generic staples but also with Rescue Ace Impulse which tributes itself from hand as a quick effect to fetch us any Rescue Ace from the deck. This can be as simple as Rescue ACE Fire Attacker for some quick draws or something like Rescue Ace Fire engine into Air Lifter or Hydrant for some hand fixing.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you want a more board breaking build consider replacing some staples with You choice of board breakers. Kurikawa, Dark Ruler, and Harpie&rsquo;s Feather Duster come to mind. Lastly the deck ensures wins through it&rsquo;s absurd grind game. Fire Attacker and Decode Talker Heatsoul put a lot of cards into your hand. Rescue Ace HQ is a complete reset and draw after you first Turbulence effect. And all of the other Rescue Ace effects are still really good at grinding.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">It is also important to remember that Rescue Ace&rsquo;s strategy inherently loses to blowout cards such as Lighting Storm, Harpies Feather Duster, and especially Evenly Matched. As such each build seeks to counteract this in it&rsquo;s own unique way. Iblee builds give an opponent a card to lock out opponent&rsquo;s from the effects, Cyberse establishes a spell/trap negate through Cyberse Desavewurm, and Rank 4 builds establish An omninegate through Therion King Regulus.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;EMERGECNY + Monster Combos</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Standard Turbulence Set 4</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So lets get into combos with the basic Turbulence set up. Emergency and any Rescue Ace monster will let us summon Rescue Ace Hydrant from the deck. Hydrant will then let us search Rescue Ace Turbulence. Turbulence can then banish out two cards in graveyard for his special summon, then turbulence get&rsquo;s his set 4 from the deck. There are options for what to set but typically it&rsquo;ll be CONTAIN, EXTINGUISH, and RESCUE for disruptions. As well as ALERT for extension.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;IP:Masqueana + Set 4</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">We can levy this previous set up into more disruptions, by using the ALERT we set to search Rescue Ace Preventer. Hydrant lets us activate it the turn it was set. We can then summon Preventer by banishing the alert. Then we can link off the Turbulence and Preventer into IP:Masquerna. Typically this helps somewhat for playing around evenly, since we can condense our board with Apollosa if they try to go to battle phase. But it also gives use access to Knightmare Unicore for flexible removal. You don&rsquo;t have to condense the board if you think Preventer + Turbulence would be more helpful</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Rescue Ace Hydrant Combos</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Decode Talker Heatsoul</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">With just a Rescue Ace Hydrant in hand out combos get a bit more limited. The combo you&rsquo;re likely to do here is to make Decode Talker Heatsoul. Normal summon Hydrant. Use Hydrant to search Prventer. Link Hydrant off into Salamangreat A&rsquo;lumiraj. Banish Hydrant to summon Preventer. Link Preventer Plus Alumiraj into Salamangreat Sunlight Wulf. Use Preventer&rsquo;s when sent to graveyard effect to revive Hydrant from banish zone. Summon Hydrant In Sunlight Wulf&rsquo;s zone to add Preventer back to hand. Link off Hydrant into Linkuriboh. Link Sunlight Wulf and Linkuriboh into Heatsoul. Then you have an extra draw to try and find a hand trap or some way to unbrick.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp; </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Decode Talker Heatsoul is a very important option because he&rsquo;s so easy to make. You can make it off emergency and any Rescue Ace monster or just an Air Lifter. Heatsoul plays into the grind game aspect of the deck and is benefited by how many hand traps builds run.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Rescue Ace Air Lifter Combos</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Decode Talker Heatsoul</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Here&rsquo;s the Just Airlifter line for Heatsoul. Airlifter search Emergency. Use emergency to summon Hydrant tributing Airlifter. Use Hydrant to search Turbulence. Turbulence banishing grave to summon him. Have turbulence set the 4 main cards. CONTAIN, EXTINGUSIH, RESCUE, and ALERT. Activate alert using Hydrant and search Preventer. Summon Preventer banishing ALERT. Link Preventer and Turbulence to make Salamangreat Sunlight Wulf. Special Airlifter using Preventer&rsquo;s when sent to graveyard effect. Link Hydrant into Linkuribo. Link Linkuriboh and Sunlight Wulf into Decode Talker Heatsoul.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So using Turbulence as a base to go into Preventer we can realistically do an absurd amount of combos. Building of this we can even summon Iblee from the deck off of one card.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Iblee Lock</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.5in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level3 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Wingdings; mso-fareast-font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&sect;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Do note that this combo is possible with just hydrant in builds running Binary sorceress and G Golem crystal heart</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Airlifter search Emergency. Use emergency to summon Hydrant tributing Airlifter. Use Hydrant to search Turbulence. Turbulence banishing grave to summon him. Have turbulence set the 4 main cards. CONTAIN, EXTINGUSIH, RESCUE, and ALERT. Activate alert using Hydrant and search Preventer. Summon Preventer banishing ALERT. Now here&rsquo;s the difference. Link summon into Puzzlomino the Drop and Deleter and then use Preventer to summon back Airlifter to the zone Puzzlomino points to. Use Puzzlomino&rsquo;s effect to change Airlifter&rsquo;s level to two. Overlay Puzzlomino and Airlifter into Gigantic Spright. Use Gigantic Spright to summon Knightmare Conductor Iblee from the deck. Link Iblee and Gigantic Spright into Beat Cop from the Underworld. Activate Iblee&rsquo;s effect when use as link material to send it to the opponent&rsquo;s field. Lastly use Beat Cop&rsquo;s effect to put a token on the Iblee. This will protect it from destruction once.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So here we have a special summon lock that can&rsquo;t be outed by a singular destruction and it prevents Lighting Storm and Evenly Matched. You can see why I favor this build.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Hydrant + Preventer / Air Lifter + Emergency</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-left: 1.0in; mso-add-space: auto; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level2 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">o<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Mudragon + Turbulence</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The last major combo is how to make Mudragon of the Swamp in order to give targeting protection to Turbulence. This is important because some players will wait out your plays to go for it. Mudragon forces this out.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Thes easiest way to get to this combo is through Air Lifter and Preventer. Summon Airlifter then search Emergency. Use emergency to summon Hydrant tributing Airlifter. Use Hydrant to search Turbulence. This time we&rsquo;re going to lead with Preventer. Summon Preventer Banishing Air Lifter. Link summon Proxy F. Magician using Hydrant and Preventer. Use Preventer&rsquo;s effect in grave to summon back Air Lifter. Use Proxy F. Magician&rsquo;s effect to fusion summon into Mudragon using both it and Air Lifter. Activate Mudragon changing himself to fire type. Now you can summon Rescue Ace Turbulence from hand without fear of being Infinite Impermanence&rsquo;d.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This combo can also be done with Preventer and Hydrant, as well as with Air Lifter and EMERGENCY. You have a ton of options with this one. Just understand it takes a good player to figure out when to play it safe with Mudragon vs when to extend with Iblee lock.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Deck List</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">My deck list is a bit of a middle ground as far as Rescue Ace builds go. I&rsquo;m running the standard core. Which you can see here. 3 of every starter, 2 each of the combo extenders, and 1 each of out hand trap extenders as well as out search targets. In the extra deck, which is where most of the spice comes from, I&rsquo;m running the Iblee Lock package, the Heatsoul Package, and the Mudragon package. TBH though the Heatsoul package is basically generic to most Rescue Ace Builds.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">My main deck is the filled up with with 3 Ash blossom and 3 Infinite impermance. Along with Resuce Ace Impulse this brings us up to 9 hand traps. Good odds to draw off of Heatsoul or just in general. Especially after setting 4 cards from deck and doing our combos.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m also running 3 Book of Eclipse and 3 Book of Moon. Board breaking is tough and these cards are excellent this format and in general to be honest.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This build has amazing power, great combos and fantastic flexibility as we can se from the before mentioned combo&rsquo;s. This builds weaknesses should be noted. First up is consistency. It has only 10 guaranteed starters which gets bumped up to about 15 with some cards working conditionally. I haven&rsquo;t had that much of a problem with it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad call to take out the Called by the Grave and throw in 3 Pot of Prosperity.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Second this build can still struggle with blowouts. If you play to timidly you will be vulnerable. Use you judgement and create boards to deal deal with an oppoen&rsquo;ts likely options. Make Iblee lock when you can. Make IP:Masquenra to conduse boards. And use REINFORCE to try not neg as hard on value. It will be rough, but you have the tools to fix it.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"">&lt;!-- [if !supportLists]--&gt;<span style=""font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""mso-list: Ignore;"">&middot;<span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Side Deck</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I&rsquo;m not going to go in depth on side deck options, but I recommend putting in at least Droll and Lock bird as well as Nibiru.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you&rsquo;re going first you can side out two copies of impulse and even potentially Fire Engine. Mostly though you&rsquo;ll be changing out the disruptions and hand traps that don&rsquo;t work in a specific match up. Like Book of Eclipse or Infinite Impermanence. I recommend following current trends for side decking.""</p>"

Interrupted Kaiju Slumber under Rexterm&rsquo;s influence is an uninterrupted board wipe that procs the grave effects of Kentregina and Rexterm. This lets you summon 2 lv4 dinomorphia from the grave, which fetches you another Frenzy for next term via Therezia and battle protection via Diplos. What&rsquo;s better, with two monsters on the field you make Arc Rebellion via Raider&rsquo;s Knight and OTK your opponent! Man is that busted!<br /><br />Plus, the Kaijus are generally good against problem decks like Purrly and Kashtira. <br /><br />Subscribe for more Yu-Gi-Oh!

I personally included them because I already had them (Kaiju package) and I pulled them for free from the extra packs (Extra Deck insects). <br /><br />The only combo this deck has revolves around Mother Spider Splitter.</p><p>1. Special summon Mother Spider Splitter.</p><p>2. Tribute Mother Spider to summon 3 Baby Spiders from deck or hand.</p><p>3. Tribute one Baby Spider to make your 2 Baby Spiders on field level 10.</p><p>4. XYZ summon Ravenous Tarantula using the two level 10 Baby Spiders.</p><p>5. Overlay Pain Gainer on top of Ravenous Tarantula.</p><p>6. Banish from GY Baby Spider, detach Ravenous Tarantula from Pain Gainer and revive Ravenous Tarantula from the GY.</p><p>This should give you 8000 ATK on board all without a normal summon. Pain Gainer can also field-wipe your opponent's monsters by destroying them. Summon 1+ more monsters and you'll have more than enough to OTK your opponent!<br /><br /></p><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

It is a minimal 6 cards, but is very effective at baiting out interruption and breaking boards. While the multiple N'Tss dumps and Fleurdelis' monster negate clears boards, the Herald of Arclight dumps search for your key Mikanko card, Ohime. By extension, the Extra deck is full of cards that benefit from being sent to the GY (N'Tss -&gt; target destroy, Herald -&gt; searches ritual, Garura -&gt; draw 1, Ferrijit -&gt; Draw 1 shuffle back, Wind Pegasus -&gt; target shuffle, Aggregator -&gt; target negate). Also, Almiraj + Secure Gardna is there to summon from a normal summon, turning on your Dogmatika monster's summoning cost/conditions. </div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">The <strong><u>KAIJU</u> </strong>cards benefit the Mikanko strategy greatly, since their gigantic bodies allow for the maximum damage reflection to be inflicted on your opponent! Their ""unfair"" ability to remove problematic monsters on the opponent's field is also particularly potent, especially against decks like Purrely! 5 cards make up this tiny engine (3 Kaijus + 2 Lava Golem). </div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">The <strong><u>ARMORY</u> </strong>engine isn't really an archetype. The 3 ""Hidden Armory"" cards search out every equip spell in the deck and by extension, most Mikanko cards (through the equip Arabesque). It also searches out Doubled-Edged Sword, arguably the deck's strongest equip spell since it essentially doubles battle damage taken by your opponent. </div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><br />The <strong><u>MIKANKO</u> </strong>cards naturally make up the majority of this deck. All these ladies centre around Ohime, which searches every card in the archetype for a discard. The equip spells are a toolbox of various effects which help enable your OTK. Ha-Re searches out Mikanko spells, Hu-Li searches out Mikanko traps and Ni-Ni serves as interruption during your opponent's turn. </div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">Less answers to Maxx ""C"" (Ash has been brought to 1 just as a target for Crossout) have been included in this deck since it doesn't really matter how much cards your opponent draws - you're gonna OTK your opponent in one turn anyways. </div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><br />42 cards are used in this strategy so that bricks/garnets are drawn less. If any bricks/garnets are drawn, it can be discarded to the GY with Ohime or it can be shuffled back with Ferrijit's effect. </div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">Other cards to think about for this deck is Pot of Extravagance for hand advantage (at the risk of banishing important Extra Deck cards) and Small World (You can search for Ohime or a Kaiju). </div><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-size: 12pt; text-align: center; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></p><div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">&nbsp;</span></div><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">Mikanko doesn't really ""combo."" This deck is basically Numeron hiding under the guise of a combo as you search out specific OTK tools. <br /><br />Mikanko is what I'd like to term a ""toolbox"" deck - a strategy where the pilot reaches into their ""toolbox"" for the appropriate response to the situation. Similar strategies are Sky Strikers (Link-1 Striker toolbox coupled with maindeck spell toolbox) and rank 4&nbsp; decks (rank 4 XYZ toolbox). <br /><br />Mikanko gameplay involves blinding second -&gt; clearing opponent's board and baiting interruption -&gt; searching appropriate OTK tools -&gt; Mikanko girls OTK. </p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">There are no clear-cut combos, but here are the deck's basic combos if you have certain cards:</p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><br /><em><strong>Nadir Servant</strong> = Draw 1-2 (Or Destroy 1-2), Search Ohime. </em></p><p class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</p><ol data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_2129""><li style=""list-style-type: '1.

If you have Hu-Li on board while every Mikanko is equipped with cards, you your Mikanko cards are untargetable, indestructible, and immune to battle destruction. During battle, they reflect damage, forcing your opponent to not attack them. Usually, this end board allows the Mikanko pilot to survive to turn 3 for an OTK crackback. </p><p class=""MsoNormal ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; font-size: 12pt; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #000000;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><ul style=""font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">While this deck is very strong against monster-based strategies, decks that rely on Spells/Traps or have multi-layered interruption in the GY, Hand and Banished Pile are difficult to deal with using Mikanko.

With those factors, I haaaaad to pull these ladies from the latest Masterduel pack. <br /><br />In Masterduel's best-of-1 format, OTK decks have a distinct advantage compared to TCG's best-of-3 format since players cannot side in hard counters and change their playstyle. This means that you can CHEESE out wins consistently towards opponents who are consistently not ready to face kaijus, boardbreakers and untargetable, indestructible, battle-immune shrine maidens!<br /><br />With Tearlaments, Spright, Runick and Branded weakened, Kashtira not at full power and Purrely common on ladder, it is time for Mikanko to shine on Masterduel Ladder! <br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It's extremely important to note that <a href=""/card/imsety-glory-of-horus-14002"" rel=""nofollow"">Imsety, Glory of Horus</a> and <a href=""/card/king-s-sarcophagus-14003"" rel=""nofollow"">King's Sarcophagus</a> send for cost, not effect, meaning Tearlament names and Shaddoll names do not trigger (however, it does trigger <a href=""/card/kelbek-the-ancient-vanguard-13255"" rel=""nofollow"">Kelbek</a>/<a href=""/card/agido-the-ancient-sentinel-13181"" rel=""nofollow"">Agido </a>so you can mill 5 if you send them for cost). If this is the case, why are we playing them? 3 reasons. First, they set up an extremely easy and available <a href=""/card/the-zombie-vampire-12679"" rel=""nofollow"">Zombie Vampire</a>, giving the deck a new way to mill that it couldn't get to easily before. Second, <a href=""/card/hapy-vanguard-of-horus-14001"" rel=""nofollow"">Hapy, Vanguard of Horus</a> is almost another <a href=""/card/keldo-the-sacred-protector-13189"" rel=""nofollow"">Keldo</a>/<a href=""/card/mudora-the-sword-oracle-13194"" rel=""nofollow"">Mudora</a>, giving a layer of interuption or recursion. Third, they can enable a really early <a href=""/card/hieratic-sky-dragon-overlord-of-heliopolis-11691"" rel=""nofollow"">Hieratic Sky Dragon, Overlord of Heliopolis</a>, giving your Tear names protection from Bystials!&nbsp;</p><p>Next thing I want to mention are the 2 shaddoll names in the deck; <a href=""/card/shaddoll-beast-331"" rel=""nofollow"">Shaddoll Beast</a> is self-explanatory, being able to draw 1 and enable <a href=""/card/el-shaddoll-winda-7907"" rel=""nofollow"">Winda</a>. <a href=""/card/helshaddoll-hollow-11637"" rel=""nofollow"">Helshaddoll Hollow</a> is another way to mill cards, being able to mill up to 6 though realistically milling 1-3 cards depending on when you mill it.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, it's worth touching on the brand new <a href=""/card/i-p-masquerena-10464"" rel=""nofollow"">I:P Masquerena</a> and <a href=""/card/s-p-little-night-14075"" rel=""nofollow"">S:P Little Night</a> combo, acting as an insane interruption during your opponents turn.

Staples are easily exchanged if budget does not allow for them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Herald in the extra is easy to get to if you have access to the infernobles and can block nib. End board is consistently a 4 mat apollusa, ciceda king, herald, and follow up. called by is necessary and crossout might be a decent idea as there are 14 flex spots in the main so there is space (this includes the 2 pots which are not necessary but help a lot)<br /><br />Tip that can help a new inzektor pilot;<br />Centipede and dragonfly trigger for ALL equips that are no longer equiped. If you have an inzektor GIGA and access to hornet, you can normal centipede or dragonfly, use its effect to equip hornet, activate GIGA to equip, activate hornet targeting giga to pop. Now you have 3 triggers, two of Centipede or dragonfly (one for each equiped card that is no longer equiped) and one giga. This allows you to chain block 2 summons and can get you 3 summons if uninterupted.&nbsp;<br /><br />The extra is flexible but I believe right now this is optimal. The rank 4s might look odd but you can easily modulate with ladybug so it is very easy to go into these powerful rank 4s. Borrelsword is my personal preference over accesscode as you can easily make a lot of inzektors and swing for game by switching them to defence for extra attacks.</p>"

If you want to spend a bit more you can easily swap out the Change of Heart to Triple Tactics Talent and also possibly change out the Pot of Extravagance to Pot of Prosperity which is getting a reprint in November. If both pots are too expensive you can also just replace it with 3x Jack in the Hand but I don't recommend it as everyone know how the floo engine works and will just pick out your robina every single time.

I generally always just stick to the 3 ash and 3 imperm no matter if I win or lose the first round, but I do switch out the dimension shifter based on what the opponent was playing in the first round + if I won the first round or not. Alot of the times you might not even want to change it as 3 Ash 3 Imperm and 3 Dimension Shifter is just so good as a whole.</p>"

The deck received a lot of supports over the years, but the deck remained just a for fun deck, that rarely saw any kind of competitive result. Thanks to this, the deck doesn't have expensive cards, except for one (<a class=""type-xyz-monster"" href=""/card/?search=11132674"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/11132674.jpg"" data-card=""11132674"" data-name=""Gigantic"">Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas</span></a>). I really recommend this deck to players that want to play the game physically without spending a lot of money and to new players that want to learn the game. The deck price its around 35~ dollars, so pretty much affordable.This is a pretty difficult deck, but I will help you explaining the cards that I decided to put in and why I'm playing them, and showing you one of the best combos in the deck.&nbsp;</p><h2>Card Explanation</h2><p>Main Deck:</p><ul><li><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=20424878"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/20424878.jpg"" data-card=""20424878"" data-name=""Springans Rockey"">Springans Rockey</span></a>: First of all, I will explain an important thing for the monsters.

There are also a few synchros added in for a back up strategy especially with Chaos Angel. It is important to activate prologue early in the opponents turn (preferably after first summon) so as to help prevent monster effects from becoming active. Your normal summon should be used on either buster whelp going first or fallen of albaz going second. Whelp gets prologue into hand if you didn't hard draw it and albaz serves as good extra deck removal or potential bait for a negate. lulu wailith can serve as a good way to search guiding quem and if bystials are on board you can synchro into Angel or Dispater. Side in back row removal for trap heavy decks like traptrix and labrynth since they can really can really hamper this strategy with out it since theres no inherent back row protection.&nbsp;</p>

Use fire's effect to add the weasel, then link it off into balelynx and search for the field spell. Then special summon the weasel and link it into a second balelynx, use weasel's effect to give the opponent your gazelle and draw 1. Then link off the first balelynx and the miragestallio to summon sunlight wolf to a zone where its arrows do not point to another monster on your field. This will trigger the miragestallio allowing you to bounce the gazelle to your hand. Link off the balelynx and sunlight wolf into heatleo and special heatleo.

Do they call you a ""dirty stall player"" for playing a deck that generates a lot of advantage while simultaneously trading one for ones with your opponent? Fear not! You can put a healthy dose of burn damage to the mix, so everyone on locals will despise you even more!<br />Introducing Runick Volcanics. This deck matches the unparalleled card advantage generation and spot removal of Runick, with the control aspect and newfound high burn capabilities of Volcanics to produce a deck that manages to outresource your opponent fast.</p><p>Being completely honest, I did not come up with this concept, but these are the ratios I ended up with. I am unsure if I like them or not, and I desperately wanted it to be 40 cards, but basically every Volcanics card is a three-of and 15 is the magic Runick number, so it is very hard to make space for it. You may cut Scattershot if you believe enough on the spot removal of Runick, since Scattershot sucks to draw. Sleipnir is also a possible cut, but I like her :)</p>"

Character decks which fit not only the original character's personality and playstyle, but also the vibe, be it the visual aesthetic of the cards, or how well their effects synergize. The typical philosophy is this; only run singles of each card unless you require multiple copies for a particular strategy, use as many cards that character actually used themselves (or a good substitute if the card doesn't exist in the actual game), maintain as much of the original vision, playstyle, and personality as possible, and beyond that just have fun. You're not limited in era so you can run as many retrains or modern support for the pre-existing cards as you want. But that's anime characters, this deck is my own personal character deck, which hopefully encapsulates me as much as possible, it's not meant to be competitive or even particularly good, just something I brainstormed one night while bored and winding down for bed.</p>"

The idea follows principles from older Tri-brigade formats in which a single card (usually Fraktall) can start a one card Spright Melffy combo all on its own, leaving plenty of room for extra disruption.</p><p>Combo 1: Frak sent from hand, dumping kitt then nerv. Player grabs Kerass then normal summons it. Player then specials bearbrum and uses its effect to grab Kitt from banished pile, summoning it to the field. Kerass and Bearbrum are overlayed to make Gigantic which summons Blue which brings Jet, grabbing Doublecross. These two overlay to make Melffy which gets Catty. Kitt's ability is then used to form Double Dragon Lord. Kitt and Melffy are linked to get Sprind, which dumps Angler, which brings two Beaver. The two Beaver are then linked into I:P. On opponent's turn Catty becomes Arch Light and I:P and Sprind can be used to make Gryphon or Apo.</p><p>This is the basic combo of the deck and should leave plenty of options to handle opponents' boards. Extra deck monsters fill the side deck to better navigate boards on the draw.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope everyone enjoys this weird mishmash. :)</p>"

Mainly this deck exists to burn, banish, or otherwise destroy and disrupt. Cards like Second Coin Toss were added to hopefully portray the sketchy nature of Keith and his tactics, borderline cheating to get the results he wants, while Jackpot 7 exists as the substitute for his 7 Completed Slot Machine play against Joey Wheeler. I didn't want this deck to be too strong, nor did I want it to just go full archetype. I tried to keep the spirit of Keith's original deck alive as much as possible while simply giving it a more modern take that - while definitely not something you wanna bring to a tournament - is at least a fun and usable Deck to use, or at least take notes from for a deck you yourself may be crafting involving a similar idea.</p>"

There will be inconsistencies and problems with deck building. Most of the time it will create a deck either under 40 cards or randomly have extra deck cards in the main deck. I've done some fine tuning whilst trying to not impact too much what ChatGPT has made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A short description made by ChatGPT about how the deck functions.<br /><br /></p><p>The Elemental HERO deck is centered around summoning powerful HERO monsters and using their fusion abilities to control the field and apply pressure to your opponent. Here's how this deck works:</p><p>Elemental HERO Neos: This is the core HERO monster. You can use cards like ""E - Emergency Call"" and ""A Hero Lives"" to quickly get Neos on the field. Neos Alius is another strong option to summon, and it can be used as fusion material.</p><p>Fusion Summons: Use ""Polymerization"" and ""Miracle Fusion"" to fusion summon your Elemental HERO fusion monsters. ""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"" and ""Elemental HERO The Shining"" are powerful fusion monsters that can help you control the field and recycle your banished HERO monsters.</p><p>Masked HEROes: ""Mask Change"" allows you to transform your HERO monsters into Masked HEROes during the Battle Phase. ""Masked HERO Dark Law"" is a particularly potent choice as it can disrupt your opponent's graveyard and hand.</p><p>Search and Support: ""Elemental HERO Blazeman"" helps search for Polymerization and can send a HERO from your deck to the graveyard, setting up for Miracle Fusion. ""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"" searches for Mask Change and other HERO cards. ""Elemental HERO Solid Soldier"" is a useful Normal Summon that can special summon another HERO from your hand.</p><p>Draw and Consistency: Cards like ""Reinforcement of the Army"" and ""E - Emergency Call"" help you search for your HERO monsters quickly. ""Elemental HERO Bubbleman"" can be special summoned if you have no other cards in hand, which can lead to an easy Xyz summon.</p><p>Protection and Removal: ""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"" provides battle protection for your HERO monsters. ""Dark Bribe"" can be used to negate your opponent's key spells and traps. ""Solemn Judgment"" helps protect your plays.</p><p>Extra Deck: The Extra Deck includes various HERO fusion monsters and Masked HEROes to cover different situations. ""Elemental HERO Neos Knight"" is a formidable attacker, while ""Masked HERO Acid"" can wipe out your opponent's backrow. ""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"" can recycle your banished HERO monsters.</p><p>This Elemental HERO deck is versatile and can adapt to different situations, making it a fun and competitive choice for HERO enthusiasts.</p>"

I've done some fine tuning whilst trying to not impact too much what ChatGPT has made.</p><p>A short description made by ChatGPT about how the deck functions.<br /><br /></p><p>The Plunder Patroll archetype focuses on controlling the field and stealing your opponent's monsters. Here's how this deck works:</p><p>Main Monsters: The core Plunder Patroll monsters - Redbeard, Whitebeard, Goldenhair, Bluebeard, Silverd, and Blackbeard - serve as your primary monsters. They have effects that allow you to equip them to your opponent's monsters, taking control of them and gaining their effects.</p><p>Support Monsters: Hand traps like Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Effect Veiler help with disruption and defense..</p><p>Spell Cards: Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping, Plunder Patroll Booty, and Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd are essential for the archetype. They help you control the field, search for your Plunder Patroll monsters, and trigger their effects. Terraforming and Reinforcement of the Army ensure you have access to these key spells.</p><p>Fusion Summons: Instant Fusion allows you to quickly bring out Thousand-Eyes Restrict or other Level 1 Fusion Monsters for Link plays or to steal opponent's monsters.</p><p>Traps: Plunder Patrollship Lys is a powerful trap card that can help you control the field further and provide protection.</p><p>Extra Deck: The Extra Deck contains various Plunder Patroll fusion monsters, each with unique abilities. Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy and Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon are included for their powerful effects. The other Extra Deck monsters provide utility and removal options.</p><p>The strategy of this deck is to disrupt your opponent with hand traps, control the field with your Plunder Patroll monsters, and use fusion summons and Link plays to apply pressure and maintain board control.</p>"

These are pretty much the only ones you need. Chain Master is a solid choice too, but for this deck specifically we aren't going to consider her. Besides them, we have 3x Giant Rat and 2x Marauding Captain to help swarm. D.D. Assailant rounds out the warrior lineup - the rest of the monsters are generic staples.</p><p>The spell and trap lineup is very standard - the only cards I want to note are Amazoness Archers and Ojama Trio. These go hand-in-hand to force your opponent to attack and deal some serious damage.</p><p>The side deck is a little unusual but I think it's pretty solid. Spell Canceller helps against Reasoning Gate. Tribe helps against any deck that runs a... well, tribe. Mind Control is for Chaos. Book of Moon and Lightning Vortex are both present for countering goat control, but Book in general is just insanely good.

Then, by banishing the low level Witchcrafters from the Graveyard, you can activate a number of powerful monster effects that let you do anything from drawing cards, adding in-archetype Spells/Traps to your hand, sending other Witchcrafter cards to the Graveyard and activating the in-archetype Spells more than once per turn! With my personal tech choices, this deck's power increases exponentially, allowing you to make it known to your opponent that even Rogue decks can be meta!</p>"

Once your opponent gazes upon the ghastly apparition that is ""Relinquished"" and watches as the control of their strongest monsters have been ""relinquished"" (ba-dum-tss), they'll know exactly who created the very game they're playing; vowing to never again forget the name, ""Maxamillion Pegasus""!</p>"

The Christian theming, Dark Souls-like artwork and the Extra Deck dumping playstyle is just too perfect! With the recent unlimit of the deck's ace card, Nadir Servant with the latest banlist and the recent support released into Masterduel, I'd say it's time to unleash the power of the corrupt clergy on ladder!</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0"">This version of Dogmatika is augmented by Spellbook cards, providing for insane advantage while summoning Jowgen during the endphase! After resolving Spellbook of Judgment and Alba Zoa's effect, you effectively FTK your opponent as most of their extra deck is in the GY and Jowgen prevents any special summoning! Your follow-up for next turn is often a 5-7 card hand full of Spellbooks and Dogmatika cards, since Spellbook of Judgment + Dogmatika gather incredible amounts of resources every turn.</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0"">Being a ""rogue"" and relatively unknown deck, Spellbook Dogmatika isn't to be underestimated - it can fight toe to toe with the strongest decks on Masterduel! Put your x3 Spellbook structure deck to competitive use! <br /></span></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div><strong><em class=""ContentPasted0"">Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</em></strong></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0"">ARCHETYPES AND DECKBUILDING</span><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></div><div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">The <strong><em>SPELLBOOK&nbsp;</em></strong>portion of this deck is composed of 14 cards. It is designed to max out on ways to get Spellbook of Judgment, since it represents a large portion of this deck's power with the Jowgen lock and potentially giving you up to 6 cards at the end phase. 3 Spellbook of Eternity, 3 Spell Magician of Prophecy and 2 Judgment give you 8 copies of this key card. The other Spellbook cards are a ""toolbox"" that you can choose from whether you want a draw 2 (Spellbook of Knowledge), interruption (Spellbook of Fate), or monster reborn (Spellbook of Life).&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">The <strong><em>DOGMATIKA&nbsp;</em></strong>cards form the other half of the deck, composed of 18 cards. This deck core is designed to turbo out the Dogmatika ritual boss monsters as fast as possible, and to initiate the Extra Deck milling strategy so you can begin gaining resources while methodically destroying your opponent's Extra Deck. The majority of the Extra deck are milling targets for your various Dogmatika cards - each part of a toolbox with various effects (N'tss destroys, Arc Light searches rituals, Garura draws 1, etc).&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">A tiny <strong><em>BRANDED&nbsp;</em></strong>package is composed of 2 cards - Branded Fusion and Fallen of Albaz. Branded Fusion is searchable by dumping to the GY Albion - so it can help push for OTK your following turn. Also, if you draw into Branded Fusion you can bring out Mirrorjade, an Extra Deck monster so you can start special summoning your Dogmatika monsters.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">As usual, the essential <strong><em>MAXX C </em></strong>package (3 Ash, 3 Maxx C, 2 Called By and 1 Crossout) is included in this deck so that you have as much possible chance to win the ""maxx c"" minigame.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""ContentPasted1 ContentPasted0"">The idea with mixing Spellbooks with Dogmatika is to activate Judgment first, then activate as many spell cards as possible to maximize the rewards you get from Spellbook of Judgment. After you finish the Spellbook portion of your strategy, the Dogmatika cards use many spells to search and ritual summon as well. Ideally, if you are allowed to fully combo, you should have sent a majority of your opponent's Extra Deck to the GY with your various Dogmatika cards (Alba Zoa, Matrix, Maximus), locked them from special summoning (Jowgen) and received about +6 drawing multiple times (Spellbook of Knowledge/Garura) and searching with Judgment! Even if your opponent manages to break through your field, you will definitely have enough follow-up next turn to OTK since Dogmatika monsters (usually with Albaz Zoa and White Relic).&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted1 ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted1 ContentPasted0"">Dogmatika's new win condition is summoning their ridiculously powerful boss monster Alba Zoa as soon as possible. Not only does it render Dogmatika monsters on the field unaffected by Extra Deck Monster effects, it forces your opponent to either send their Extra Deck/Hand to the GY or return every Extra Deck monster they have on their field! This easy to summon card makes OTKs extremely easy (it has 4000ATK!), makes your more resillient, and renders Extra Deck centered strategies void.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted1 ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted1 ContentPasted0"">After you control your opponent, lock them out and destroy all their resources, the Dogmatika cards should generate enough beatsticks to allow you to push for game next turn. Spellbook Dogmatika is basically a spell heavy version of a similar strategy, Floowandereeze. Summon floodgates and beatsticks to lockdown and control your opponent to victory - only this time you spam spells like a Runick/Sky Striker player.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted1 ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">Depending on what you draw, the combos of this deck varies. Sometimes you only get either archetype of the deck and not the other. Most hands get both Spellbook and Dogmatika on board. Both strategies are competent on their own, but ideally both Spellbook and Dogmatika prefer to be up and active.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0""><em><strong>Spellbook Magician of Prophecy + Nadir Servant</strong></em> = Jowgen's Special Summon Lock, +3 to +8 cards in hand (various searches, draw effects + Judgment), most of your opponent's Extra Deck milled (Dogmatika card effects), 4000ATK/DEF Dogmatika beatstick (Alba Zoa) on field.&nbsp;</div><div><ol><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Normal summon Spellbook Magician of Prophecy. Search Spellbook of Judgment.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Activate Spellbook of Judgment. This will summon Jowgen in the endphase, and search you Spellbook cards up to the number of spells you activated.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Link summon Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden using Magician of Prophecy.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Activate Nadir Servant, sending Garura. Search for Ecclessia. Draw 1 card with Garura's effect.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Special summon Ecclessia now that there is an Extra Deck monster on the field. Search for Maximus.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Special summon Maximus by banishing Garura in the GY.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Activate Maximus' effect to send two to the GY from your Extra Deck and your Opponent's Extra Deck. Send Arc Light + another ED monster of your choice.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Arc Light searches for any Ritual monster/spell. Search for the missing pieces to summon Alba Zoa depending on the cards in your hand. Ideally, you should get Dogmatikalamity and Alba Zoa.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Activate Dogmatikalamity to summon Alba Zoa.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Activate Alba Zoa's effect to mill half of your opponent's Extra Deck.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">During the End Phase, the effect of Spellbook of Judgment resolves, summoning Jowgen from deck, and adding up to 6 different Spellbook Spells to your hand. Also, if you sent Albion or Titaniklad to the GY, search for Branded Fusion and your Dogmatika monster of choice!</li></ol><div class=""ContentPasted0"">With two cards the deck's endboard is a special summon lock with Jowgen, several Dogmatika beatsticks, a fatty hand of 6+ cards, and enough follow-up next turn for you to easily OTK.&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div></div></div><div><div><div><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">GENERAL TIPS</span></strong></div><div><ul><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Before using your draw effects like Garura and Spellbook of Knowledge, try to thin out your deck first by finishing your searches first. This increases the chances of you drawing an important starter or a unsearcheable staple like Ash Blossom!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">A great card to use in this deck is Secret Village of Spellcasters. This spellcaster centered floodgate card generally is an auto-win (vs. decks like Branded for example), especially when you face decks that heavily use spellcards but don't have any spellcasters.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Droll &amp; Lockbird absolutely destroys this deck. If your opponent resolves this card vs. you, it essentially skips your turn. Good thing Droll isn't used much in Masterduel!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">White Relic is an OTK card, best used in turn 3. In turn 3 when its your turn to conduct an attack, you can ritual summon White Relic and use its effect targeting itself and Alba Zoa. Her attack will reach 4500, allowing you to push for an easy OTK!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Remember that this deck is a spell heavy version of a similar strategy, Floowandereeze. You turbo out floodgates, get a ton of resources and OTK with beatsticks - the only difference is that you spam spells instead of normal summons!&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Buy the x3 Spellbook Structure deck for the spellbook cards to save on your UR and SR points!</li></ul></div><div><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><em class=""ContentPasted0"">Want to see the deck in action?

I see alot of peeps using only bystial as an support in this deck wich makes sens but I have a feeling not alot of ppl have experience with resonators. In wich they are very fragile in playstyle (if Red Rising Dragon negated you have no other options). With Chaos influence and having nice synergy with Bystials makes this deck slightly better.</p>"

The relationship between Skull Guardian and Novox is similar to Rescue-ACE Hydrant and Turbulence. You kinda want them both on the field, but the Level 1 is more important if you can only have one.</p><p>Non-ritual Sauravis can go into any of your ritual monsters except Benten. You can go into Ritual Sauravis to return to hand and negate and banish a special summon, which sets up a hand-trap negate in case Barrier gets removed.</p><p>If non-ritual Sauravis' effect counts as a ritual summon, you can also go into Pendulumgraph to burn your opponent, negate a spell, summon an Odd-Eyes from the Extra Deck, then search a ritual spell during the End Phase.</p><p>Ritual Saffira is good going first, due to its hand ripping effect in the end phase. It's also useful if you need to return Novox from GY to hand, or to get more cards in hand.</p><p>Ideally, you want Novox and Silenforcing Barrier out as soon as possible. This can be expedited using Diviner, Benten, and One for One.</p><p>Diviner, sending Herald of the Arc Light, then ritual summoning using Diviner will allow you to special summon Novox from deck.</p><p>Tributing Benten for a ritual summon will add Novox to hand.</p><p>One for One will also special Novox. This is why I've chosen Effect Veiler over Infinite Impermanence. Veiler plus a Level 6 Diviner can also give you the levels for your Level 7 Rituals.</p><p>Pre-Preparation is good because Skull Guardian, Sauravis, and Saffira are all mentioned on the ritual spell.</p><p>Preparation is good because it can search all your ritual monsters. It's also easy to get the ritual spell in grave to retrieve using Preparation.</p><p>The trap Authority offers an alternative target for Novox's effect and acts as an additional searcher if you happened to open Barrier.</p><p>The extra deck is pretty free outside of the Diviner targets. I added some targets for Pendulumgraph, as well as some Rank 7s since most of the cards you'll be summoning are Level 7s. I tried to pick out some good LIGHTs since they'll be protected by Barrier. I added some generic Links that work with LIGHTs and Rituals. Feel free to change it up as needed.</p><p>Overall, the ratios felt good, but I'm always open to some constructive criticism.</p>"

The whole Armored Xyz line is simple. It all starts with 2 Level 3's going into&nbsp;<strong>Xyz Armor Torpedo</strong>, detaching 2 to draw 1, overlaying into&nbsp;<strong>Xyz Armor Fortress</strong>, and detaching to add&nbsp;<strong>Full Armored Xyz</strong>. It's a cool thing to do when your Deck is running enough Level 3 or 4 monsters to go into a Rank 3 or 4. And this brings us here to Lady of Lament Full Armored Xyz. You have the option of doing your usual Lady of Lament shenanigans or going through the whole Armored Xyz line with&nbsp;<strong>Tour Guide From the Underworld</strong> and ending on the ability to go into a <strong>Full Armored DARK Lancer</strong> with its attach effect live while also backing it up with a bunch of Traps. Or, you can just do both: go through the whole Armored Xyz line for DARK Lancer access while also having Lilith setting you Traps. In addition to that, you also have the option of using the Armored Xyz cards as an OTK tool on turn 3 after you've gotten through your opponent's turn with your Traps. To accomplish this, we are playing some Burning Abyss monsters in order to help get out a Rank 3 and/or to help get a Level 3 DARK Fiend on the field without relying on your Normal Summon.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong>. This is our only big Main Deck monster we are playing. I find that&nbsp;<strong>Doomdog Octhros</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Lady Labrynth of the Silver Castle</strong> to be much more of a hindrance in this Deck since we want to have Tour Guide get out BA's and have BA's in hand instead. Lord gives protection to your set backrow and it can get you a Spell/Trap from Deck which is much more useful. 3&nbsp;<strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> and 3 <strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong>. Lilith Tributes a DARK monster to reveal 3 Normal Traps in your Deck for your opponent to randomly choose 1 to set to your field. Alice Summons a Lady of Lament from grave on Normal Summon, she can Special herself from hand by banishing a Trap from hand or GY, and she adds a Fiend whose combined ATK and DEF equals 2000 from your Deck when Tributed or destroyed. Lilith gives you access to your Traps while Alice gets you follow-up or starts your plays on following turns. The funniest thing about Alice's effect to add a Fiend whose combined stats equals 2000 when Tributed is that you can search Libic with it. Which is why we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</strong> and 2&nbsp;<strong>Scarm, Malebranche</strong><strong> of the Burning Abyss</strong>. BA's can Special themselves from hand if you control no Spell/Trap Cards, but we will not always be using that effect because they are only 1 effect per turn and only once that turn. If anything, their effects when sent to grave are what we are aiming for. Libic Specials a Level 3 DARK Fiend from your hand with its effects negated when sent to grave and Scarm adds a Level 3 DARK Fiend from your Deck during the End Phase it was sent to grave. If you Summon Libic off of Tour Guide, make a Rank 3 with them, and detach Libic, you get to Summon a Level 3 DARK Fiend from hand which can give you a Level 3 DARK Fiend monster on field for&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> for your Lady of Lament plays after you've done all of your Armored Xyz plays. You can Summon Tour Guide, Scarm, or Alice. Scarm and Alice will also give you additional benefits in more searches. But, you'd rather not Summon Lilith as she functionally does nothing if negated which invalidates the whole idea of getting a Level 3 DARK Fiend on field for Ties. As for Scarm, you can search Tour Guide, Alice, or Lilith for next turn which is great. Finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Tour Guide From the Underworld</strong> which Summons a Level 3 Fiend from hand or Deck with its effect negated so that you have easy Rank 3 access for your Armored Xyz plays.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> which targets a monster and summons 2 monsters from Deck with the same Type and Attribute but with different names. This is essential to the Lady of Lament portion of your Deck. 1&nbsp;<strong>Armored Xyz</strong>. This equips an Xyz in grave to a monster you control, making the ATK of the equipped monster the same as the ATK of the Xyz Monster, gives it the same Attribute, and you can send it to the GY so that monster can make a second attack. The card is okay overall, even in a dedicated Armored Xyz Deck, but we are playing it in case we draw our 1-of&nbsp;<strong>Full Armored Xyz</strong> or if we activated Prosperity this turn. Speaking of, 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Simul Archfiends</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>. Simul Archfiends makes it so that for the turn, neither player can Special Summon the same card types as they currently control (Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link) and if you don't control 2 of the same card type, all Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Links you control gain 500 ATK. This card is sort of like D Barrier, but I feel like it has some more applications in different situations. First of all, it affects Links whereas D Barrier doesn't which is really nice against Link strategies. Second, if your opponent were playing an Xyz Deck, Simul Archfiends does not negate your own Armored Xyz monsters. You can use Full Armored Xyz earlier in the turn before your opponent has committed to a Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Summon, and still have the ability to stop your opponent from going into more of their Ritual/Extra Deck plays while keeping your own Armored Xyz monsters live. Even so, we are still playing 1 D Barrier in the situation where you don't face an Xyz Deck or in the case where you only have access to the Lady of Lament portion of your Deck and need a more heavy-handed way to deal with your opponent's turn. 3&nbsp;<strong>Fiend Griefing</strong> which shuffles a monster in your opponent's GY into the Deck and gives you the option of sending a Fiend from your Deck to the GY. You are usually going to be sending Scarm for an add during the End Phase, but you can optionally also play a&nbsp;<strong>Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</strong> in order to have another form of monster removal. 1&nbsp;<strong>Full Armored Xyz</strong> which immediately allows you to Xyz Summon if you control an Xyz Monster, and you can banish it from GY to equip an Xyz from field or GY to an Xyz you control where the equipped monster gains ATK equal to the equipped monster's ATK and if it would be destroyed, you can destroy the equip instead. 2&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Rollback</strong> which pays half to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your opponent's GY and you can pay half and banish it from GY to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your GY. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Anti-Spell Fragrance</strong> to give you more insulation against certain types of Spell-based removal.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Extra Deck, 1&nbsp;<strong>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Golden Cloud Beast - Malong</strong> for a draw, pop, or bounce when sent off of&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Stellar Nemesis T-PHON - Doomsday Star</strong>. 1<strong> D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong> which can be made with a D/D/D monster which is usually going to be Darius which gives you 2 activations of its effect which can detach 2 to attach an opponent's card to it as material once per chain. 1&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> for a negate when sent off of&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Full Armored DARK Lancer</strong> which can be made with a Rank 5 or 6 and gains 300 ATK for each material attached to it. It can add back an Xyz card from GY every turn and if its equipped with an equip card, it can attach a monster your opponent controls to itself as material. 1&nbsp;<strong>Full Armored Crystalzero Lancer</strong> which can be made with a Rank 5 WATER and it gains 500 ATK for each of its materials. If it would be destroyed, you can detach 1, and you can detach 1 to negate the effects of all face-up monsters your opponent controls for the turn. This card can give DARK Lancer more material and going second, it can negate your opponent's board for more insurance for an OTK. 1&nbsp;<strong>Xyz Armor Fortress</strong> which can be made with a Rank 3 or 4 monster and it cannot be used as Xyz material if it has material. You can also detach up to 2 materials from it to add the same number of Armored Xyz cards with different names from Deck, and if its equipped to a monster, the equiped monster deals double battle damage when it battles another monster. The fact that you cannot use it as Xyz material if it has material is so annoying whic his why we have to play&nbsp;<strong>Armored Xyz</strong> in addition to&nbsp;<strong>Full Armored Xyz</strong> in order to have another card to search to detach 2 from it in the advent where you activated Prosperity for the turn and cannot detach 2 from Armor Torpedo. But this card is very important for the whole Armored Xyz line. 1&nbsp;<strong>Xyz Armor Torpedo</strong> which can detach 2 to draw 1 card and if its equipped to a monster, it prevents your opponent from activating cards and effects when the equipped monster battles and also negate the effects of all face-up monsters your opponent controls until the end of the damage step, and if the equipped monster is an Xyz monster, it cannot be targeted. 1&nbsp;<strong>Number 47: Nightmare Shark</strong> which can detach 1 to make a WATER you control able to attack directly for the turn. This is good for Zeus plays, but it being able to detach 1 at any point means that you can rank it up into Armor Fortress for it to detach 2 for 2 searches and have it be able to be used as Xyz Material. 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong> which can be ranked up into Machinex or it can make itself be unable to be destroyed by battle and destroy the monster it battled which is good for making Zeus. Finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Unchained Soul Lord of Yama</strong> which is a send off of <strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong> as it can banish itself from GY if a card(s) you control is destroyed to Summon a Fiend from hand or GY.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Torrential Tribute</strong>. You can Main Deck this card, but it does conflict with your Armored Xyz monsters as you might end up destroying them or having to destroy an equipped Xyz via the effect of&nbsp;<strong>Full Armored Xyz</strong> to protected the equipped monster which can prevent you from OTKing on the following turn, but it isn't too great of an issue, so it is up to you whether you want to Main Deck it or not. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Centaur Mina can then arrive onto the field and, because of what is good from God, a level 2 monster in waiting (in the hand) or one that doesn&rsquo;t want to be on the field (in the GY) can arrive onto the field and an opponent&rsquo;s hidden technique can be avoided. The prophet in waiting, Silvervine Senri, can then be summoned to use the message he has from God to &ldquo;have faith in His Goodness&rdquo; which is used to tell a level 2 monster that it is okay to go back onto the field as well as a level 2 monster in waiting if God&rsquo;s diversity can be showcased. With these monster(s) being allowed onto the field by the promises of God, they are able to support their allies in some way, call an Xyz or Synchro monster to the field, or make a spiritual connection to call a Link monster onto the field. In this example, the message from God is used to call Gigant Spright who is able to use the level 2 monster&rsquo;s message from God to tell another level 2 monster to join it on the field in good faith toward God. If Hero Kid is told of this message, he can use the suit God gave him to call other Hero Kids to the field that are not in waiting or don&rsquo;t want to be on the field. And the Hero Kids that received the message from God in good faith can then use that to either call Sky Calvary Centaurius to the field or make a spiritual connection to Spright Sprind to call it to the field. Sprind and Centarius can then be used to have others stay in waiting due to the goodness of God. Penguins can help by stressing the importance of staying in waiting due to the promises that God has given them via Penguin Sword and their whole archetype strategy. Slower Swallow can be used too due to the messages from God she delivers to others.</p>"

Return decks do struggle with balancing stuff you actually want to get rid of to benefit off the card while also making sure you don't brick, so this tries to balance a good few boss monsters with lots of consistency and destruction from everything else. Generally the deck is fine establishing field presence due to this.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss monsters include Ruler for the very handy effect negation and Skull Archfiend for targetting immunity. Paying 500 every turn doesn't matter when you're going to be either going for a big push with Return or just bashing into things; plus losing life points isn't a huge issue with Return decks anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Spells include Book of Moon to recycle your Assailent/Mimics while also handling potential problem cards. Stuff like Card Destruction and Lightning Storm help run through your cards easier.&nbsp;</p><p>Traps are minimalistic given the heavy focus on monsters.

Some fun little disruption tecs into the deck such as Time Thief Redoer, Harpie's Feather Duster, and Mirror Force for nostalgia's sake. The goal here was to make Dragonmaids the actual focus of the deck rather than just a secondary win condition. Keep in mind this is mostly just for fun and your results will liekly not be as good as the ""most optimal"" strategy. You could probably create a pretty good side deck with minimal effort, but I wanted to keep this as cheap as possible, but still able to occasionally perform really well against more ""meta"" decks.</p>"

On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</strong> functionally has similar, if not better OTK potential while also giving you the ability to make better use of&nbsp;<strong>Hyper Blaze</strong> rather than having to rely on 2 hard-to-summon monsters. This Deck intends to use cards like&nbsp;<strong>Dark Beckoning Beast</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Opening of the Spirit Gates</strong> to get you a&nbsp;<strong>Chaos Core</strong> on the field, which gives you a Level 3 DARK Fiend Target for&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> while also allowing you to set up a Uria OTK with Hyper Blaze on your following turn or a bit later.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong> which can reveal itself in hand to give all of your Set cards destruction protection, and if you activate a set Spell/Trap from hand, and if it was revealed already, you can set a Spell/Trap from Deck. First off, giving protection to your backrow is already such a good effect, but in this Deck, specifically, since we want to try to OTK with Uria on your following turn, Lord can set&nbsp;<strong>Hyper Blaze</strong> from your Deck to set-up the OTK for your following turn. 1&nbsp;<strong>Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</strong>. It needs to be Specialed from hand by sending 3 face-up Traps you control to grave and gains 1000 ATK for each Continuous Trap in your GY, and it can destroy a set Spell/Trap every turn. You are never hard-Summoning this card. We are usually getting this out from GY with Hyper Blaze ignoring its Summoning Conditions. 3&nbsp;<strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> which can Tribute a monster to have your opponent choose 1 of 3 Normal Traps of your choice to set from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong> which can Summon back a Lady of Lament from GY on Normal Summon, it can banish a Trap from hand or GY to Special itself from hand, and if it's Tributed, it can add a Fiend whose ATK and DEF equals 2000 when combined which gives you access to Lilith for next turn. 1&nbsp;<strong>Chaos Core</strong>. It is a bit of a strange card as it is essentially pretty bad, even though it was released in 2020 in the Sacred Beast Structure Deck. It essentially is supposed to set-up&nbsp;<strong>Dimension Fusion Destruction</strong> as it sends up to 1 each of Raviel, Hamon, and Uria from hand and/or Deck to GY if its targeted by an attack or effect to place a Phantasm Counter on itself for each which prevents battle damage and prevents it from being destroyed. However, it has a different use in this Deck. For 1, it is a Level 3 DARK Fiend target for&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> on field. Since Beckoning Beast gives you an extra normal for this card, you can Link them off for a Link-2 and Summon back Chaos Core with Spirit Gates, giving you a Level 3 DARK Fiend on field with a Link-2 for more interaction and/or interruption on your opponent's turn. Also, since Ties targets Chaos Core, it can send a Uria from Deck to put it into rotation for Hyper Blaze to bring it back next turn. 3&nbsp;<strong>Dark Beckoning Beast</strong> which adds a Uria, Hamon, or Raviel or a card that mentions one of them from your Deck on Normal Summon. Also, it gives you an extra Normal of a Fiend with 0 ATK and DEF. Again, this gives you access to Chaos Core on field for a Link play for Spirit Gates to bring back Chaos Core. Finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Tour Guide From the Underworld</strong> for an Xyz play in a tight spot.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Opening of the Spirit Gates</strong>. On activation, it searches Uria, Hamon, or Raviel or a monster that mentions one of them from Deck. As a soft OPT, it can discard a card to Special Summon a Fiend from GY with 0 ATK and DEF. This gets you back Chaos Core after a Link play for a target on field for Ties, of course. And it's third effect adds back a Continuous Spell from GY if you control a Level 10 monster which is not relevant in this Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> which Summons 2 monsters from Deck with the same Type, Attribute, and Level as a targeted monster you control. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Rollback</strong> which pays half your Life Points to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your opponent's GY and can banish itself from GY and pay half to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your GY. Because Spirit Gates discards to bring back a Fiend, it give you the opportunity to discard Transaction Rollback to have access to its GY effect which is much better in this Deck. The same goes for Hyper Blaze's effect to discard a card to bring back a Sacred Beast. 3&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend's Ghastly Glitch</strong> which targets a card on field and destroys it if you control a Fiend and gives you the option of sending a Fiend from Deck to GY afterwards. 1&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Torrential Tribute</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Hyper Blaze</strong> which makes Uria's Summoning Conditions able to send face-down Traps you control. Also, once per battle, it can send a Trap from hand or Deck to the GY to make the ATK/DEF of a Uria you control become equal to the number of Traps on field and in GY x1000 for the rest of the turn which is great for OTKing. And it can discard a card to bring back a Sacred Beast. We will be going through plenty of Traps in a Lady of Lament Deck, and this card allows you to easily Summon Uria while also making it a great OTK tool.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Fossil Warrior Skull Knight</strong>, 2 <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Golden Cloud Beast - Malong</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong> targets. Garura draws a card, Skull Knight can banish itself from GY to destroy a monster on field, N'tss destroys a card when sent to GY, Malong bounces a face-up card your opponent controls, and Aggregator negates the effects of a face-up card your opponent controls. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Stellar Nemesis T-PHON - Doomsday Star</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong> which can be made with any D/D/D monster and it can detach 2 cards when your opponent's monster card activates its effect and attaches it to this card. 1&nbsp;<strong>Downerd Magician</strong> for more Zeus material. 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong> which can be ranked up into Machinex or protect itself during battle for you to easily make Zeus. 1&nbsp;<strong>Number 49: Fortune Tune</strong> to make Zeus, 1&nbsp;<strong>Unchained Soul Lord of Yama</strong> which can be send off of Ultimate Slayer or Punishment as it can banish itself from GY when a card(s) you control is destroyed to Summon a Fiend from hand or GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Night</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> for your Link play options.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Simul Archfiends</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Ice Dragon's Prison</strong>.</span></p>"

I've always been a fan of Gravekeepers since probably the GX days, they've just never carried a good reputation with them. Playing them in a combo-heavy format like Edison will cause some rage, especially with how busted Gravekeepers can be with the right setup.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, Necrovalley is extremely dangerous; even with the Edison rules meaning that it can be destroyed with a simple field spell it's still one of the most oppressive effects out there despite the confusing errata texts. Most meta/good Edison builds require Graveyard access to some degree and removing that shuts a lot of them down from the get-go while turning all of your monsters into either super dangerous beatsticks or annoying walls that can't be easily smashed through. Generally as a Gravekeeper player you want to keep it active as much as humanly possible, so we use numerous protections to do this; Starlight is a obvious one, but this can be played around, so Spell-Shield is used as a secondary alongside a copy of Judgment of Anubis to handle single-target destruction options to keep them guessing.</p><p>Royal Tribute WILL win you games from the first turn if you draw right. Seeing as Edison deck metas generally have a lot more focus on monsters than backrow activating a first turn Tribute generally means minimal loss of 2 cards, though for me I was getting 3/4 more often and even managed to completely wipe out a hand or two. It's not only free infomation on the opponent, it's just disgustingly uninteractable.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than that, this deck mostly plays like a usual Gravekeeper deck of the time, focused around field control and slower play. Generally you want to be in a position where your defence lets the opponent make mistakes and allows you to spring on them with horrible backrow negates and huge monster values. I guess what makes Gravekeepers so great is that you can play both offence and defence and the deck doesn't really suffer for it as a whole. With Commandment/Spy/Stele and Allure you also get a ton of consistency + recovery, being able to reliably get your critical pieces over and over.&nbsp;</p><p>Side-deck is based around whatever is being played, including some conventional counters, more consistency, or trying to deal with a specific style or combo. Nothing much else to say.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I hardly search for these guys and at one point just cut them off.</p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/8/86/AncientWarriorsRebelliousLuFeng-BLVO-EN-SR-1E.png/300px-AncientWarriorsRebelliousLuFeng-BLVO-EN-SR-1E.png"" alt=""AncientWarriorsRebelliousLuFeng-BLVO-EN-SR-1E.png"" loading=""lazy"" /><img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/d/da/AncientWarriorsSavageDonYing-DIFO-EN-C-1E.png/300px-AncientWarriorsSavageDonYing-DIFO-EN-C-1E.png"" alt=""AncientWarriorsSavageDonYing-DIFO-EN-C-1E.png"" width=""299"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">One of the only Dark Monsters in the Archetype, <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=82791472"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/82791472.jpg"" data-card=""82791472"" data-name=""Ancient Warriors - Rebellious Lu Feng"">Ancient Warriors - Rebellious Lu Feng</span></a> is a crucial endboard piece, summoning himself if you control the highest attack Ancient Warrior on board.

When your opponent activates Dark Ruler/Droplet, CL2 Red Zone to pop a card, then CL3 Hot Red Dragon Archfiend's effect to negate the card. Pretty snazzy eh? Not every deck can use a monster to negate Dark Ruler/Droplet!</span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Try to leave Soul Resonator in the GY after your combo, it is destruction protection while you control any synchro monster that mentions Red Dragon Archfiend!</span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Try to set up your banished pile with a card so that Bystial Dispater can at least use it's destruction effect! Sometimes depending on your cards Bystial Dispater's destroy/negation effect won't be live. The best cards to set up the banished piles are Bystials and Obsessive Uvualoop.&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Obsessive Uvualoop is an incredible extender in this deck. It's also searchable as part of this deck's combo (for example, if you already have Crimson Resonator, you can search for Uvualoop). This card can banish multiple synchro monsters at the end of the regular combo so that Dispater can summon them from the banished pile, while setting up Dispater's destroy/negation!&nbsp;</span></li><li class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">Bystials do an incredible job of cracking boards and forcing interaction from your opponent. Resolve Bystial cards first before moving on to your main combo!

He is not needed and can be swapped for wollow which js a good way to increase damage output. Level 6 vampire xyz is a good option, or putting a 2nd of any extra deck monster such as vampire sucker is fine. Chaos ruler and elfs effects were simply extenders so it is not too much of a loss.

It's frustrating to see how nobody aims to built a pure variant nowadays even so recent support made that exact variant so much stronger. That's why I take up the task of introducing a pure Dragunity variant to you today, let's look into the Details to find out why they are so strong:&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Researching the Dragunity Tribe history</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">First of all this Archetype's general Goal is to equip Small Dragon tuners to Winged Beast Monsters who then become their riders by Synchro summoning into a Dragunity Knight. A rather new focus is Banishing cards too. Very simply put that's what Dragunity is all about.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The interesting part now is all the little interactions inbetween the Archetype that make it so unique and a one of a kind archetype. Unlike many other Duel Terminal 1 Archetype's this one has been good since it's dawn thanks to an early Structure Deck release. Now let's take a look at all the small Details:</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Arriving at the hidden Ravine in Mist Valley</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Getting started in this Deck is not difficult. Use cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Mystletainn&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Legatus&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Senatus&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Remus&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragon Ravine&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Whirlwind&nbsp;or&nbsp;Dragunity Glow&nbsp;to get things easily into motion in some kind of way. Since we look at least at 23 different starters within the Maindeck alone you can imagine that getting started is not a problem with this Deck. And that is not even counting in more convoluted starters like&nbsp;Dragunity Militum. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">At this point I want to mention the L1 Winged Beast&nbsp;Dragunity Tribus&nbsp;who didn't make the cut in this Decklist but is yet another way to get things started. He can mill&nbsp;Dragunity Remus&nbsp;who can then revive itself and setup a Link-2 play easily. He's not bad but other starters felt a little more versatile and useful to me while testing out this Deck in a Master Duel environment.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">I know that people also like to use&nbsp;Dragunity Phalanx&nbsp;who is just like&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;but in terms of a pure variant he's also just worse.&nbsp;Dragunity Phalanx&nbsp;is generic and that's the biggest reason to use him but&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;is straightup better in this pure variant.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">There are some other Dragunity Monsters like&nbsp;Dragunity Corsesca&nbsp;(Who is good) and Spells who didn't make it into the final list mostly because they are kinda outdated or don't fit into the bigger strategy for this Deck.  </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Enough of badmouthing cool cards for now. After knowing how to get started we analyze every Maindeck Monster and Spell/Trap next. Prepare yourself for a lot of text (I really try to keep it short).&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>The Riders, The Small Dragons &amp; The Big Dragons</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Monsters can be put into 4 Categories. The Winged Beast non tuners, the Dragon tuners, the Dragon non tuners and the Dragunity Knights who are mostly the bosses. We start with the Winged Beast riders first. I won't mention many limitations while explaining since we play this Deck pure anyway and we don't have to care about any of these:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Primus Pilus&nbsp;is a L5 with 2200/1600 Statline. When he's Normal or Special summoned you can target a Winged Beast and equip it with a L3 or lower Dragon from your Deck. This effect can miss timing but he fulfills various roles in this Deck. He's the only L5 Winged Beast which makes him the only way to access the L8 Synchro&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Barcha&nbsp;with the effect of&nbsp;Dragunity Whirlwind. Furthermore he's the strongest banishing target for&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gae Bulg&nbsp;to bring him up to 4200 ATK if he attacks. With an equipped&nbsp;Dragunity Brandistock&nbsp;he could even reach 6000 ATK on a followup attack which is even better and that's not even counting in cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance. The last important part is the loop potential with&nbsp;Dragunity Legion. With that card you can use the effect of&nbsp;Dragunity Primus Pilus&nbsp;every turn and setup easy L6, 7 or 8 Synchro plays or Link-2 lines. Lorewise he's the rider of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Trident. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Militum&nbsp;is a L4 with 1700/1200 Statline. Once per turn she can Special summon a Dragunity Card from the Spell &amp; Trap Zone to your field. She's the only Dragunity Card which can special summon your equipped Dragunity Cards in Attack Position back to the field which is kinda important to have if you equipped big Beaters like&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;to something on the field. She also turns into an starter if you also have&nbsp;Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;in your hand. Normal summon&nbsp;Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;and special&nbsp;Dragunity Militum, then use her effect to special&nbsp;Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;and you just got a Link-2 or L6 Synchro summon setup. Lorewise she's the rider of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Dux&nbsp;is a L4 with 1500/1000 Statline. He gains additional 200 ATK for every Dragunity Card under your Control. When normal summoned he can equip a L3 or lower Dragon from the GY to himself. He can kinda easily reach 3700 ATK through his effect alone which is kinda ridiculous and is a good option to get things started with&nbsp;Dragon Ravine&nbsp;combined or to get a situation back in your favor. The most optimal target for these kind of effects is almost always&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;since he can special summon himself directly on the field afterwards. Lorewise he's the rider of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gae Bulg&nbsp;and later&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;too.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Legatus&nbsp;is a L4 with 1800/1200 Statline. He can be special summoned if&nbsp;Dragon Ravine&nbsp;and/or any Dragunity Monster is on the field. Also if you have a Dragunity Monster in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone you can target any Spell/Trap on the field and destroy it. Both effects are HOPT's (Hard Once per Turns). He's important since he can get things into motion without wasting your normal summon especially with&nbsp;Dragunity Remus&nbsp;combined and even has a built in removal that could even get rid of your own backrow if there's something you need in the GY to make space. As example you could destroy your&nbsp;Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;to get a free removal or&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Luin&nbsp;to change the equip target. Lorewise he's the rider of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Senatus&nbsp;is a L4 with 1800/600 Statline. By discarding one Dragunity card as a cost he can equip a Dragunity tuner Monster from the Deck to himself. If a Dragunity Card(s) would be destroyed by Battle or Card effect you can destroy a card equipped to&nbsp;Dragunity Senatus&nbsp;instead. The first effect is a HOPT. He's maybe the most simple Starter you can find monster wise. If you equip&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;you easily reach a L10 Synchro play from that position. Since he equips directly from the Deck he and cards with similar effects are all unaffected by cards like&nbsp;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&nbsp;too which is even better. Furthermore he has a quite useful protection effect which makes&nbsp;Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;a interesting equip choice in mid to late game too, for protection and removal at the same time. Lorewise he's the rider of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Luin. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Legionnaire&nbsp;is a L3 with 1200/800 Statline. Just like&nbsp;Dragunity Dux&nbsp;he can on normal summon equip a L3 or lower Dragon from GY to himself. Unlike Dux however he can send a Dragunity card from the Spell &amp; Trap Zone to the GY to target and destroy an opponents Monster without a once per turn. Using him after cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Barcha&nbsp;brought many Dragunity Cards into the Spell &amp; Trap Zone is very effective. He also enables easy L7 Synchro lines with&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;combined and is an all around good helper in many Situations. Lorewise he's the rider of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Just to finish the rider lore&nbsp;Dragunity Angusticlavii&nbsp;which we won't ever play is the rider of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Barcha. Both&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar&nbsp;and it's older counterpart&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Romulus&nbsp;may have&nbsp;Dragunity Legatus&nbsp;as a rider but that's not 100% confirmed.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Now let's continue with the small Dragons which are also all Dragon tuners:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Darkspear&nbsp;is a L3 Tuner with 1000/1000 Statline. He can once per turn tribute a Dragon Monster to special a L4 or lower Winged Beast from the GY. This effect is kinda useful to recycle all the riders we just talked about minus the L5&nbsp;Dragunity Primus Pilus&nbsp;and since that's a soft once per turn there's even some loop potential too. With&nbsp;Dragunity Glow&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Legion&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Militum&nbsp;you can get Monsters from the Spell &amp; Trap zone back to the field and with&nbsp;Dragunity Legion&nbsp;you can even get them back from the GY. Consider that if you think about how to use&nbsp;Dragunity Darkspear&nbsp;most efficiently. Lorewise this little Dragon is&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Guisarme&nbsp;is a L3 Tuner with 600/1600 Statline. He has 2 HOPT's. When normal summoned you can revive a L4 or lower Dragon/Winged Beast type Monster and negate it's effects and if equipped to a Monster you can special summon him. He's overall strong since he can act as a recovery tool and combo piece at the same time. Easy L6 or 7 Synchro lines or Link-2 lines are quite possible with him. Lorewise he's&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;is a L2 Tuner with 1000/800 Statline. When normal summoned you can special any Dragunity Monster from the Hand and equip Aklys to it. When he's send to the GY while equipped you target and destroy a card on the field. He's part of an older kind of Playstyle Dragunity used to have and may be the best one of these nowadays. The mandatory removal with no once per turn limitations is very easy to trigger in this Deck, even multiple times in one turn and can seriously stress out the opponent.&nbsp;Dragunity Legion&nbsp;once again prooves to be useful for that but also cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar&nbsp;can easily trigger him. Be sure to check the ruling page at the bottom to learn more about him. Lorewise he's&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Couse&nbsp;is a L2 Tuner with 1000/200 Statline. He can be treated as a L4 Tuner and can special summon himself while equipped. No once per turns to be found on this card. He's simply the best Dragon to be equipped since he can always Special summon himself onto the field as often as he wants to. I won't explain the 500+ possible lines you can go into with him so just remember play him or don't play Dragunity. Lorewise he's&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Luin. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Remus&nbsp;is a L2 Tuner with 800/800 Statline. He can be discarded to search&nbsp;Dragon Ravine&nbsp;and can special himself from the GY if you control a Dragunity Monster but is banished if he leaves the field then. Both effects are HOPT's. He's a great Starter and Combo piece to go into all kinds of Extra Deck plays and should always lure around in the GY to be an extra summon if needed. Lorewise he's&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Romulus. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Brandistock&nbsp;is a L1 Tuner with 600/400 Statline. He enables 2 attacks for the monster he is equipped to not just on Monsters but in general. Use him on&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;or&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair&nbsp;who are equipped with&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance&nbsp;(Who can equip&nbsp;Dragunity Brandistock&nbsp;from Deck) and you get a 4300 ATK Monster that attacks twice and most likely an empty Board if used on&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon. He may look small but little Brandi is an OTK Beast! Lorewise he has no big dragon counterpart but can be seen in the background of&nbsp;Dragunity Primus Pilus&nbsp;which may indicate that he's part of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Trident&nbsp;with&nbsp;Dragunity Javelin&nbsp;combined.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">To finish the small Dragon lore&nbsp;Dragunity Phalanx&nbsp;which we don't play is&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gae Bulg&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Pilum&nbsp;which we also don't play is&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Barcha.&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance&nbsp;in it's dragon form and&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair&nbsp;may be something similar but that's not confirmed.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Finally for this section we move to the big maindeck non tuner Dragons:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Arma Gram&nbsp;is a L10 with 2900/2200 Statline. He can be summoned from Hand or GY by banishing 2 Dragon and/or Winged Beast Monsters from the GY. He can target a face up monster, negate it's effects and reduce it's ATK by 1000 for each equip card you control. When an opponents Monster is destroyed by battle it can be equipped to this card. Each effect is a HOPT. He's easily summoned, negates effects and steals Monsters which is kinda good. It doesn't even matter which Monster destroys an opponents Monster, if&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Gram&nbsp;is on the field it can be equipped to him. The equipped Monster can even be summoned to your field with&nbsp;Dragunity Glow&nbsp;be it in defense position but that's still quite useful. The negation is permanent but isn't a quick effect. Overall he's pretty strong and a recurring threat every turn on top of all that.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Arma Leyvaten&nbsp;is a L8 with 2600/1200 Statline. He can be summoned from the Hand or GY by banishing a Monster equipped with a Dragunity card. When normal or special summoned he can equip any Dragon from the GY to himself and when sent to the GY by an opponents card effect one monster equipped to&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Leyvaten&nbsp;at that time can be special summoned. I see a lot of when... you can... on this card so there's a problem with missing timing for sure but being L8 he's an easy line into your L10 bosses and he can potentially revive your bosses too should they be equipped to him. Also in true 5DS fashion there are no once per turns on this card and just like&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Gram&nbsp;he's a recurring threat from the GY and that even multiple times in one turn.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Arma Mystletainn&nbsp;is a L6 with 2100/1500 Statline. By sending a Dragunity Monster from field to GY he can be special summoned from the Hand. When he's normal or special summoned from the Hand he can equip a Dragon from the GY to himself. He's a instant L10 Synchro summon with&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;and can even equip other Synchro bosses from the GY to him which can then be brought into play with cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Militum. He can also circumvent the usage of your normal summon which is great. He truly stood the test of time and is formidable to this very day. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Finally we reached the end of this section. Let's take a look at the backrow lineup next (I promise that's shorter).&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Creation of the Divine Lance</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Funny enough&nbsp;Dragon Ravine&nbsp;is the only card which has not Dragunity in it's name even so it's that central to the strategy. As a soft once per turn by discarding 1 card you can either search a L4 or lower Dragunity Monster from Deck to Hand or mill any Dragon from Deck to GY. This card is a prime example for an abusable field Spell. You can easily mill cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Gram&nbsp;or search&nbsp;Dragunity Senatus&nbsp;or&nbsp;Dragunity Legatus&nbsp;and then go into a Link-2 play with&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Romulus&nbsp;and search another&nbsp;Dragon Ravine, activate it and search or mill again. You could then search&nbsp;Dragunity Remus&nbsp;and search the third copy of&nbsp;Dragon Ravine, activate it and repeat the effect a third time in one turn. Obviously you need 3 cards to discard but since all your Monsters like to be in the GY anyway that's not a big Problem.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Whirlwind&nbsp;is a quick play spell that brings out a Dragon Tuner and Winged Beast non Tuner from the Deck with their effects negated. The opponent has to control a Monster and you have to control no Monsters for that to work. If the opponent controls a Extra Deck Monster you can immediately Synchro summon with Dragunity Monsters on the field too. A great going second and comeback tool which is always useful to get a instant L6, 7 or 8 Synchro play.&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar&nbsp;may be the best target most of the time with this card. You can only activate one&nbsp;Dragunity Whirlwind&nbsp;every turn. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Divine Lance&nbsp;gives a 100 ATK Bonus times the Level of the equipped Monster and makes it unaffected by Trap effects. As a HOPT you can equip a Tuner directly from the Deck to the equipped Monster. If used as a Starter you can equip&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;easily and start going into your Combo. If used as a finisher&nbsp;Dragunity Brandistock&nbsp;is the go to card to create a OTK Beast that attacks Twice. Note that being unaffected by Trap effects also makes it unaffected from&nbsp;Dragunity Oubliette's 2nd ATK gain effect. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Glow&nbsp;can search or recycle a L5 or higher Dragunity Monster from the Deck/GY. You can also banish this card from the GY to special a Monster in your Spell &amp; Trap zone which is equipped to a Dragunity Monster in defense Position to your field. Both effects are HOPT's. Searching or reusing&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Mystletainn&nbsp;is often the best usage of this card since that creates easy L10 Synchro lines. The GY effect like mentioned earlier is useful with&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Gram&nbsp;but can also special any in Archetype Monsters back to the field.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Oubliette&nbsp;is a Counter Trap that needs a Dragunity Synchro on the field to be used. It negates a Spell/Trap activation and banishes that card. If a L10 Dragunity Monster is on the field you can give a 100 ATK Bonus to a Dragunity Monster after that. For every Face up banished card it's an additional 100 ATK. Only one&nbsp;Dragunity Oubliette&nbsp;can be activated every turn. With&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair&nbsp;combined you have a Monster, Spell and Trap Negation which all banish the activated card on top of that. The opponent will quickly end up in an inescapable corner if these 2 cards enter the field.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Finally&nbsp;Dragunity Legion&nbsp;is a permanent Trap that can activate one of two effects every turn. Either special summon a Dragunity Monster from the Spell/Trap Zone in defense position or equip a Dragunity Monster from the GY to one of your Dragunity Monsters. The amount of versatility this card opens up is what makes this card so useful. Whenever you may need it&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Romulus&nbsp;can search this card.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In total the Maindeck is pure Gas and guarantees massive Synchro swarming every turn. Let's hope these Synchro Monsters are somewhat good... well let's find out!</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>The Dragunity Knights Descend!</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">It's time for some Boss Monsters. We start with the weakest and go only up from there:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Romulus&nbsp;is your Link-2 Monster with 1200 ATK which searches your whole Spell &amp; Trap lineup on Link summon. His 2nd effect triggers if a Dragon Monster from the Extra Deck is summoned to a zone this card points to. Then you may special summon any Dragon/Winged Beast from your Hand in defense position. That Monster has it's effects negated during that turn and can't be used as Link Material. The Main reason to play&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Romulus&nbsp;is his easily accessible search effect. He opens up many lines into stronger cards and is a centerstone of attention in the early game.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Luin&nbsp;is a L6 Tuner with 1200/1900 Statline. His effects are HOPT's. If special summoned a Dragunity Monster from the GY can be equipped to him. Even Winged Beasts can be equipped with this effect. If sent to the GY he can be equipped to a Dragunity Monster and that Monster gains 1000 ATK/DEF. Note that he's a Tuner and his effect triggers no matter how he's special summoned. There's loop potential with&nbsp;Dragunity Legion&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Glow&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Militum&nbsp;possible. Also if his 2nd effect is used on&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar&nbsp;he can banish 2 cards from the GY every turn without loosing his equip since Luin will reequip himself.&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Luin&nbsp;is overall a very useful addition to the strategy.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana&nbsp;is a L6 with 1900/1200 Statline which needs a Winged Beast as a non tuner. When synchro summoned she can equip a L3 or lower Dragunity Dragon to herself. Once per turn she can send 1 of her equips to the GY to double her ATK reaching 3800 ATK easily... but wait it says current ATK! If you equip&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Luin&nbsp;and one&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance&nbsp;to her before using that effect she will reach 7000 ATK until the End Phase. More&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance's or&nbsp;Dragunity Oubliette&nbsp;thrown into the mix can make this number even bigger. She turns out to be the biggest Beatstick in the whole Deck with just a little setup. Not even Obelisk shall stand in your way!&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Gae Bulg&nbsp;is a L6 with 2000/1100 Statline which needs a Winged Beast as a non tuner. (The only reason to mention that is since cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Arma Mystletainn&nbsp;who can't summon these cards anyway are Dragon Monsters. Really only&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Barcha&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Trident&nbsp;are affected by the Winged Beast limitation). Once per Battle by banishing a Winged Beast during the Damage Step the ATK of this card are increased by the original ATK of that banished Monster until the End Phase. By banishing&nbsp;Dragunity Primus Pilus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Legatus&nbsp;or&nbsp;Dragunity Senatus&nbsp;while equipped with&nbsp;Dragunity Brandistock&nbsp;he will have 6000 ATK during the 2nd attack. Add&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Luin&nbsp;to the mix and it's already 7600 ATK. Just like&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana&nbsp;he can reach very menacing ATK values very quickly and thus shouldn't be underestimated.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg&nbsp;is a L6 with 2400/800 Statline which needs a Winged Beast as a non tuner. His effect is the search effect of&nbsp;Dragon Ravine&nbsp;but after searching a L4 or lower Monster to the Hand, A Monster (Not a Card) has to be discarded. It's a soft once per turn on a Monster and can be looped with&nbsp;Dragunity Legion&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Glow&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Militum&nbsp;like usual. Certainly a good option to generate more advantage quickly.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Trident&nbsp;is a L7 with 2400/1700 Statline which needs a Winged Beast as a non tuner. Once per turn you can send up to 3 cards you control to the GY to look at the opponents Extra Deck and send an equal amount of cards from there to the GY. This effect sounds expensive but with a card like&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Barcha&nbsp;it's almost free. Deleting precious cards like&nbsp;Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder&nbsp;,&nbsp;Accesscode Talker&nbsp;or that nasty&nbsp;Expurrely Noir&nbsp;is just a joy to see. You don't like&nbsp;Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon? Just delete it. Is&nbsp;Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart&nbsp;a problem? Just get rid of it. Not a friend of&nbsp;Sky Striker Ace - Kagari? Bye bye Kagari. Sprig... okay okay I think that are enough examples for now. Going first you even gain knowledge over what the opponent might be playing on top of this already strong effect. Even better as a soft once per turn you can reuse this effect with cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Legion&nbsp;quite easily. You do need 1 to 3 cards to send but that won't be bothering you much, trust me. He's a unique and very strong option and a very welcome addition especially going first.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar&nbsp;is a L7 Synchro with 2600/2300 Statline. On Synchro summon a Dragunity tuner can be equipped to him and as a quick effect you can send one of the equips from him to the GY to target up to 2 cards in the opponents GY and banish them. Combined with&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Luin&nbsp;this effect can be used every turn and&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar&nbsp;turns into a 3600 ATK beast on top of that. He makes up for a great going first tool. There's a reason people still play&nbsp;D.D. Crow&nbsp;to this very day.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Barcha&nbsp;is a L8 Synchro with 2000/1200 Statline which needs a Winged Beast non tuner. On Synchro summon any amount of Dragunity Dragons can be equipped to him from the GY (Synchro Monsters included). He gains 300 ATK for each. He can reach 3500 ATK easily with his effect alone and is perfect for bigger Combo plays. Use&nbsp;Dragunity Couse&nbsp;and go into a variety of different Synchro plays from there. Gather material for the cost of&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Trident&nbsp;and other effects or equip&nbsp;Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;to get additional removal. You can even equip cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;and use&nbsp;Dragunity Militum&nbsp;to special these cards after that. Truly a card which stood the test of time and forms another centerstone of attention within this Strategy.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair&nbsp;is a L10 Synchro with 3300/3200 Statline and 3 HOPT's. He can negate a Monster effect activation by banishing a Dragunity Monster from the GY, even in Damage Step. He can banish a Monster destroyed by Battle with him, which also happens in Damage Step and if the opponent destroys him you can destroy all Spell/Traps from the opponent. An overall strong Boss which can push the opponent easily into an inescapable corner with&nbsp;Dragunity Oubliette&nbsp;combined. He's one Card you always wanna summon to the field for sure, especially going first. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;is a L10 Synchro with 3300/3200 Statline. Without a once per turn he can banish a Dragunity monster from the GY to target and banish a Monster from the opponent. As a HOPT if he was synchro summoned and is destroyed through the opponent you can special summon any Dragunity Synchro Monster with 3000 or less ATK from the Extra Deck (Treated as Synchro summon). Combine him with&nbsp;Dragunity Brandistock&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance&nbsp;and you get a easy 4300 ATK threat which attacks twice, is unaffected by traps and clears all Monsters by himself. A OTK Beast for sure. The 2nd effect can be chained to a&nbsp;Dragunity Whirlwind&nbsp;as Chain Link 2 to get a bigger variety of Synchro plays available with&nbsp;Dragunity Whirlwind. Overall he's the best Monster in terms of agressive power that you can summon. Having both&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair&nbsp;on the field turn one always feels good to achieve.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">And with that the Boss Monster section is now finished now we can move on to the next segment.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Cold Dust in the Dragon Ravine </strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Like always every Deck has it's weakpoints. Dragunity has a hard time against&nbsp;Dimension Shifter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Macro Cosmos. They want to setup a big GY and these cards prevent that alltogether.&nbsp;Necrovalley&nbsp;is also bad since Dragunity moves a lot of cards from the GY to other places and having that forbidden is a serious problem.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The lack of Draw Power can also proove to be a problem. Since cards like&nbsp;Dragon Ravine&nbsp;,&nbsp;Dragunity Senatus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg&nbsp;force you to discard you can end up with an empty Hand rather quickly. Then again if you successfully establish the equip ressource loop that is of no concerne anymore. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Cards like&nbsp;Nibiru, the Primal Being&nbsp;are certainly not good but also not that bad either since you play so many starters in this Deck. However a pure anti swarming strategy does hurt this Deck obviously.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In general Dragunity is very versatile and can play around it's weakpoints pretty well in almost any Situation.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>The Final Oubliette for Trishula</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity is a very unique and fun Deck for sure. If you are searching for a strong and big Combo Deck, you will like this type of strategy a lot. It can easily deal with meta Decks and the pure WIND attribute plays in it's favor even better. LIGHT and DARK are Attributes everyone is prepared for but WIND is more of an underdog and that's your advantage with this Deck.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">As for Master Duel you can easily aim for Master League with this Strategy. My advice is to go first if possible and use&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Oubliette&nbsp;to set up negation and top it of with a&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Trident&nbsp;who can get rid of key cards in the opponents Extra Deck Strategy, and reveal what he's playing. If you are able to also have a&nbsp;Dragunity Whirlwind&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Gormfaobhar&nbsp;ready and the perfect going first Board is established. This OTK heavy strategy shines best going second but in Master Duel many strange FTK's and mass negation Decks are the usual problems which make going first much better in 90% of cases (especially in higher leagues).&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">A Deck full of Combos and Versatility is waiting for you to be explored. Dragunity is at your disposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Final Rating:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★★ OTK Potential </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★☆☆☆ Defensive Tools </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★☆ Control Options </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★★ Removal Options </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★★ Recovery/Recycling </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★☆☆ Card Advantage </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Overall Rating: ★★★★★★☆&nbsp; 36/42★</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Special instructions before entering the Ravine&nbsp;</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Just like every Duel Terminal 1 Archetype there are quite a few rules you should know about before getting started:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>About equipping:</strong>&nbsp;A Dragunity Monster that is equipped to something is treated as a Spell. Still cards like&nbsp;Dragunity Militum&nbsp;can bring it onto the field as a Monster.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Arma Gram: 1. His negation is Permanent. 2. He can target your cards too with that effect.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Arma Leyvaten: 1. He can miss timing. 2. If the equipped Monster is owned by the opponent you can still special summon it if he leaves the field and the timing is correct.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Primus Pilus: 1. He can miss timing. 2.&nbsp;Dragunity Aklys&nbsp;cannot trigger his effect because the word ""then"" in his card text makes him miss timing. 3. Unlike&nbsp;Dragunity Dux&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dragunity Legionnaire&nbsp;a Monster equipped with his effect stays equipped even if&nbsp;Skill Drain&nbsp;is activated.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Darkspear: He can tribute face down Monsters as cost for his effect.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Aklys: 1. His destruction effect is mandatory. 2. If the monster he's equipped to leaves the field he won't trigger his effect since he wasn't equipped to the Monster anymore. 3. His first effect has a ""then"" in it's text which makes When... you can... effects miss timing.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Brandistock: His effect is being treated as a Spell effect and is Continuous.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Whirlwind: If a card like&nbsp;Dragunity Knight - Ascalon&nbsp;is destroyed and his effect is about to trigger and your Board is empty, activate this card as chain link 1 and Ascalon as chain link 2. Like that you can summon bigger Synchro Monsters with the additional effect of&nbsp;Dragunity Whirlwind. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Legion: This cards effects are unaffected by&nbsp;Dragunity Divine Lance. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Barcha: If targeted cards leave the GY the remaining cards are still equipped to him. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana: 1. She can send equip cards from the opponent equipped to her to the GY to activate her effect. 2.

The Prosperities can be swapped for Extrav hence the extra deck looking.....well how it does. Oh and yeah most of this deck's staples are ones that I just kinda had lying around so replace em as you see fit.</p><p>Just remeber to use Dream Traitor before popping Rite of Aramesir if you draw em both. Phantasms also acts as extra copies of Dream Traitor. If you already have a Dream Traitor in hand then Morpheus is a good one to add to hand since for main combo you could end with Tormentor and Sprite using Dream Traitor and Discple for Dream mirror of chaos. Then use Dream Mirror of Terror and on oppenents turn you can use Sprite effect to get out Mara special summoning Morpheus popping a card. If you also had Hypnagogia you could even special te Erlking after using Tormentor negate to get an extra pop.<br /><br />I would generally recommend placing Dream Mirror of Terror in your field zone and giving your opponent Joy with Hypnagogia</p>"

You want to have as many normal monsters as possible to maximize its effect, but having too many normal monsters in hand is really bad. Luckily this deck can't really worry about it, because there are only 6 level 2 aqua normal monsters (only 3 in the tcg).</p><p>If you somehow get the best hand on earth, you might be able to end on <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=65741786"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/65741786.jpg"" data-card=""65741786"" data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</span></a> and enough material to make <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=98127546"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/98127546.jpg"" data-card=""98127546"" data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</span></a>, but it really isn't worth it. I just added it because there was so much free extra deck space I didn't know what to do with it.</p><hr /><h2>Going Second</h2><p>This is the most important part. When you play with someone, you will roll to see who goes first. The trick here is, you want to get the higher roll and go first. If you're playing online, you want to win the coin flip or rock-paper-scissors or whatever it is. Just make sure to go first.</p><p>After you have successfully gone first, side in all the going second stuff. You're going to need it. This deck has very little board breaking power, and because of spright restrictions its very difficult to go into <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=86066372"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/86066372.jpg"" data-card=""86066372"" data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</span></a> or <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=85289965"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/85289965.jpg"" data-card=""85289965"" data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</span></a>. So you need to preventing from bulding a board in the first place.

It has all the same qualities, just worse. You also can't play it in the tcg, and if you want to purchase the deck, it will set you back $300.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Its first effect lets you search for either Grand Tiki Elder (needed for Shunoros) or Shunoros itself and puts it on top of your deck. With some luck, you can draw it this turn if it survives a second attack. Its third effect allows you to search for Divine Serpent Geh as a backup if Shunoros is destroyed or any other needed monster. The fourth effect allows you to search for any card in the deck, but I recommend searching for an Equip Spell. These spells are best saved for Shunoros, as it's the ace monster. Stacking multiple equips on Shunoros can turn it into a formidable one-shot threat.</p><p style=""border: 0px solid #d9d9e3; box-sizing: border-box; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(69,89,164,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; margin: 1.25em 0px; color: #d1d5db; font-family: S&ouml;hne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px; white-space-collapse: preserve; background-color: #444654;"">The Calculator is a great monster to have alongside Shunoros or Geh, becoming a beatstick that can protect or be protected by your boss monster when the Seal is active. Super Hippo Carnival works well with The Calculator or any monster equipped with United We Stand, serving a similar function to Dartz's Mirror Calling.</p><p style=""border: 0px solid #d9d9e3; box-sizing: border-box; --tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-color: rgba(69,89,164,.5); --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; margin: 1.25em 0px 0px; color: #d1d5db; font-family: S&ouml;hne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px; white-space-collapse: preserve; background-color: #444654;"">Eater Of Millions helps control the field by banishing cards, ensuring there are no problematic monsters when Shunoros is on the field. It also boosts Gren Maju Da Eiza, the deck's last beatstick. While considering a self-reviving or additional beatstick for Da Eiza, I opted for more firepower to enhance the deck's overall strength. I hope you like it !</p>"

Its Albaz/Branded engine is at 5-7. Why? Its simple. The focus is getting DM on the field and/or getting his Fusions on the field. The goal is setting up a Dragon Knight stall board (consisting of Circle and Eternal Soul) so you can utilize your resources for the next turn while exploiting your opponent's and gaining knowledge of the cards they use or play with.&nbsp;</p><p>Card analysis:</p><p>1. Magician Navigation searches for the most important cards of the deck: DM, Apprentice, Dark Illusion, and DMG. The core ratios are at 2 except Dark Illusion. You can replace Dark Illusion with Mahad since they are both at 1. With the Branded build, its better to go with Mahad instead. Your best cards to help you would be Apprentice and/or DMG for ATK boost, searching, or combos with cards such as Salvation and Combination when you use Navigation, also, Navigation can negate Spell/Trap Cards even while Dragon Knight is on the field.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Secrets of Dark Magic is at 3 because you can chain while Rod gets targeted by cards such Veiler or Impermanence. Circle can make it add 1+, also, Branded can discard or you can Fusion summon furthermore using Branded.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Illusion of Chaos does not need Preparation but it does need Branded Fusion to get rid of a extra card which can help your draw power with cards like Soul Servant.</p><p>4. Soul Servant searches your important cards such as DM, Rod, Timaeus, Circle, Eternal, Souls, etc. Its important to have at 3.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Fusion Deployment at 1 and Branded Fusion at 3 has good synergy and can cause continuous combos in 1 turn. Fusion Deployment can be used for 1 card combo by using Cartesia or can help you with Piercing the Darkness by summoning DM to draw 1 card. Branded Fusion is 1.5 card combo that can setup your Dragon Knight board quicker and setup a potential draw 2 (draw 3 if you use Mahad instead of Dark Illusion). Since Branded locks you out Extra Deck already (except for Fusion Summoning), Deployment does not make much of a difference. You can ratio Deployment at 2 and Branded at 2. But its best to leave Deployment at 1 and Branded at 3.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Allure of Darkness can aid your draw power and has synergy with Lubellion to unbanish your DARK monsters that you banished after you drawn 2 cards. You can keep Albaz in your GY while you can unbanish the other through Branded Fusion. You should also have it ratio'd at 2. You can replace it with Wonder Wand since players use Ash Blossom for Rod. If they Ash Blossom you, you can draw 2 cards by sending Rod to the GY by using Wonder Wand instead. The choice is up to whatever the player feels comfortable with between Allure or Wonder Wand.&nbsp;</p><p>7. Piercing the Darkness can increase DM the Dragon Knight ATK so other monsters cannot destroy it by battle and also help you draw 1 card each turn you summon DM.&nbsp;</p><p>8. Magicalized Fusion can summon an extra Dragoon in the late game and can summon Quintet to field wipe your opponent.&nbsp;</p><p>9. Apprentice Illusion can help you beat boss monsters in battle such as Dragoon by giving your Spellcasters a 2000 ATK Boost. You easily destroy powerful cards like Dark Dragoon in battle just by sending Apprentice to the GY.&nbsp;</p><p>Also remember the MAIN goal is to setup the Dragon Knight board, then wait until your next turn to summon heavy boss monsters after your opponent uses and wastes resources. Dark Magician was ALWAYS meant to be played This way with DM the Dragon Knight, Circle, and Eternal Soul so you come back stronger during your next turn. Hint: Magicians Rod has a recycling effect for a reason so you can get access to more cards to deal with your opponent in more ways to win your way to victory. The mistake DM players make is trying shotgun Dark Dragoon for a easy win. You will NOT ever win your duels this way. You can summon Dragoon your next turn so you can OTK your opponent more properly after having knowledge on their Deck and strategies. The card ratios for each monster and Spell/Trap are perfectly good going first or second.&nbsp;</p><p>""But what about having handtraps?"" Then this deck would fail with them in it so it does not matter, win or lose. 90% of the time your opponent runs out of cards to use by cramming in handtraps that make lose resources and run out of good cards to play with in their hand. But adding or changing any other cards thats on here, will ruin the deck. So dont consider it. DARK MAGICIAN BEST DECK!</p>"

Using Destrudo to target Polari/ Pola Star/ Crystal Girl to Special Dragster at the end of your Ursarctic combo.<br /><br />Crystal Girl is the perfect extender for the Deck. Just make sure NOT to activate her on NORMAL SUMMON effect so that your Adventure Engine won't turn off that turn.<br /><br />Ringowurm + Polari/ Pola Star/ Crystal Girl can make you Tatsunoko then with 1 Level 7 Ursarctic in hand you can make either Gymir or the Barone.<br /><br />Ringowurm + Token = Level 6 Tuners.

Then + Level 7 Ursarctic for the Polari or Pola Star.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't mind to tribute Gyphon Rider or Illegal Knight for your Ursarctic play.

You can use cards like The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion to facilitate this.</p><p>Trigger the Effects: Use your Unchained monsters' effects to destroy themselves, triggering their effects. Unchained Soul of Disaster can then be Special Summoned, leading to further destruction.</p><p>Disrupt Your Opponent: Utilize Escape of the Unchained to protect your monsters and trigger more effects. Your opponent will find it challenging to maintain a board presence with your continuous disruptions.</p><p>Hand Traps: Keep Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring and Effect Veiler ready to disrupt your opponent's key plays during their turn, maintaining your control over the duel.</p><p>Extra Deck Power: Your Extra Deck includes Unchained Abomination, Unchained Soul of Anguish, and other powerful monsters. These should be summoned strategically to deal with various threats.</p><p>Spell and Trap Support: Use cards like Dark Hole, Twin Twisters, and Harpie's Feather Duster to clear your opponent's backrow and maintain field control.</p><p>Finish Strong: When the opportunity arises, bring out formidable Link monsters like Borrelsword Dragon or Accesscode Talker to finish the duel in your favor.</p><p>The Unchained Chaos deck excels at disrupting your opponent's strategy while maintaining a strong field presence.

Some variations of this do exist, but they're more inclinded to use stall burn instead, which is lame and takes the aggro out of this deck to just sit on advantage and burn. This variation just wants to stack as much damage as humanly possible through a great combination of effects, burn, and punching power.</p><p>Unlike some versions we can't really abuse stuff like Panda + Ojama Trio due to many meta decks relying on potentially using the Ojama tokens for big special summons, so no Panda and one Ojama copy, mostly for later game or to brick up the field. The base of the deck is instead around Koala due to doing stupid amounts of damage and being a pretty great wall by his lonesome, of which it's been really useful in doing so in testing as a reliable set; it's kinda funny how much people sleep on the card despite it having some really great utility. It can be used for:</p><p>1. Set into big burn (generally 1/2k depending on hand size and if they can even beat over it with whatever is attacking)</p><p>2. Play as wall&nbsp;</p><p>3. As a low-threat poker with a chainable Moon</p><p>4. As a Rescue Cat target for potential level 6 Synchro</p><p>etc</p><p>Spy's another thing borrowed from Goat Format and it's just as good if not better here given Decendent is around for easy and solid removal. Despite the weird synergy in this kind of deck it's actually worked really well in mixing things up and getting monsters on the field as soon as possible. Guard is a good alternative and his bouncing is remarkably potent on a lot of boss monsters in the format.</p><p>For the aggro it comes mostly from the mix of big statlines from Gorilla/Cyber/Gorz and co with the boost from Rescue Cat and Nimble/Ryko or Koala being able to keep the monster flow going. The Airbellum copies are of course great as beaters/tuners to boot.&nbsp;</p><p>Spells are kept to generally basic stuff, mostly ways to destroy or run through deck faster. Side deck includes Necrovalley and Commandment in case it's needed to either get the Gravekeepers a boost and/or block graveyard heavy combos.</p><p>Traps are, again, generally basic, mostly designed around being things that you can either chain around or for general battle protection. Obviously this is where the big damage comes from and it generally causes the most issues for a first game.&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck is essential because most decks tend to run Royal Decree as a anti-trap option, which can be a fair issue for this kind of deck. At that point I usually change things up by adding splashers in Giant Rat and Injection Lily as a nasty combo that is hard to predict accurately and settling more for general damage instead while they're busy trying to play around the burn issue. Starlight Road was a considered option, but seeing as you aren't really sitting on backrow you want to protect, I couldn't really see it as something to use here, through it can definitely be useful if this is made slower with more field control and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

There really isnt a strategy, just summon some guys (preferably the 1200 guys since they are the biggest you're getting) and hit as hard as possible. Sparks is for that oh so crucial burn damage, and Red Medicine is to help heal up to 1500 LP, which in a grindier state like this might actually help out a bit!</p>"

Let's put them into a Deck. But first, a question: ""What monster is a Level 3 DARK Fiend whose combined ATK and DEF equal 2000 and can be used as a Fusion Material substitute?"" That's right, it's <strong>Versago the Destroyer</strong>. Not only can it substitute itself for a named monster for a Fusion Summon, it is also a Level 3 DARK Fiend monster which allows you to get it from Deck off of&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> in your Lady of Lament Deck, or you can target it on field with Ties to get your Lady of Laments out of the Deck. And guess what card is a Normal Trap? That's right, it's&nbsp;<strong>Necro Fusion</strong>. You can set it off of Lilith because it's a Normal Trap and you can use it alongside Versago to bring out Fusion Monsters such as Colorless,&nbsp;Fusion Grapha, and Granguignol on your opponent's turn to make full use of their effects to their maximum potential.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Main Deck monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong>. You can reveal this card in your hand to give all of your set cards destruction protection. Then, if a set Spell/Trap is activated, you can summon it from hand, and if it was already revealed, you can set a Spell/Trap from Deck. Protection is always great, and being able to easily bring out a very large body with the additional effect of being able to set any Spell/Trap from Deck is incredible. 3&nbsp;<strong>Lady Labrynth of the Silver Castle</strong>. She can be Summoned from hand the turn a Normal Trap was activated, and while you control a Set card, she cannot be destroyed or targeted by your opponent's card effects. Also, if you activate a Normal Trap, you can set a Normal Trap with a different name from Deck. Again, this is a very easily summonable, large body with the added effect of setting a Normal Trap directly from your Deck. 2&nbsp;<strong>Versago the Destroyer</strong>. It is a Level 3 DARK Fiend who can substitute itself for a Fusion Material listed on a Fusion Monster for a Fusion Summon. To reiterate, Versago is a Level 3 DARK Fiend, making it a target for Ties on the field and a target in Deck to Summon off of Ties. And with it being able to substitue itself for any monster listed on a Fusion Monster for a Fusion Summon, you can use it in tandem with&nbsp;<strong>Necro Fusion</strong> in order to get out Fusion Monsters with a handful of useful effects on your opponent's turn that all vary in what they do. I would only play 1 because playing more copies does increase the chances of you drawing it, which is really not optimal. But since Necro Fusion is not once per turn and since it banishes monsters from the GY face-down as Fusion Material, I feel like playing 2 is more than enough for our purposes. 2 <strong>Tour Guide From the Underworld</strong> which on Normal Summon, Special Summons a Level 3 Fiend from hand or Deck with its effects negated. This gives you easy Rank 3 access to make something like&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong> to go into either Zeus or&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong>. In addition to that, it can also get out necessary Level 3 Fiends out of your Deck, being Versago or our next card.&nbsp;<strong>Doomdog Octhros</strong>, which we only play 1 of. When it is sent from field to GY, it is a mandatory effect to add a Level 8 Fiend monster from Deck to hand. It is really good to get off of Ties of the Brethren in order to be Tributed by Lilith. Lilith then sets a Normal Trap from Deck while Doomdog gets to search you Lady Labrynth from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Lilith Lady of Lament</strong> who is a Quick Effect to Tribute a DARK monster to reveal 3 Normal Traps in your Deck and have your opponent randomly choose 1 for you to set. This is a great way of accessing Traps, on your turn to prepare for your opponent's turn, or on your opponent's turn for follow-up. 3&nbsp;<strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong> who can Summon a Lady of Lament from GY on Normal Summon and she can also banish a Trap from hand or GY to Summon herself from hand. Then, if she is tributed, she can search a Fiend from Deck whose ATK/DEF total to 2000. Usually, you are going to be searching Lilith for next turn, but you can also search for Versago in case you want it in rotation for next turn.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong>. This targets a Level 4 or lower monster on field and Special Summons 2 monsters with the same Level, Type, and Attribute from your Deck with different names. This is a crucial card in Lady of Lament as it gets all of the necessary monsters on field, while also providing Tribute fodder for Lilith for her to set Normal Traps from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Necro Fusion</strong>. This is a Normal Trap that Fusion Summons a Fusion Monster from Extra Deck by banishing Fusion Materials from GY face-down. Since this card is a Normal Trap, it is easily searchable by Lilith, and you could optionally play a copy of&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick</strong> if you really wanted to, in order to access it even more often. And of course, with Versago being easily integratable into the Lady of Lament strategy, you can use it to substitue a named Fusion Material such as&nbsp;<strong>Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World</strong> for Colorless,&nbsp;<strong>Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World</strong> for Fusion Grapha, and&nbsp;<strong>Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous</strong> for Granguignol. 3&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend's Ghastly Glitch</strong> which targets a card on field if you control a Fiend and destroys it, and then it allows you the option to send a Fiend from Deck to GY. First of all, this card is not once per turn, which means that having multiple copies set or in your starting hand does not dampen any of your potential plays on your opponent's turn. Second, it pops any card on field which is very good for targeting monsters and backrow. Third, it gives you the option of sending a Fiend from Deck to GY afterwards. You can send Versago in the situation where you did not get him into rotation turn 1 in order for your Necro Fusion to be live and have the ability to Summon your Fusions with named material. It also gives you the option to activate multiple Necro Fusions if you opened more than 1. Necro Fusion banishes materials from GY face-down, so being able to put more material in grave is really good. 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Destructive Daruma Karma Cannon</strong> which changes as many monsters on the field to face-down Defense Position and sends all remaining face-up monsters to GY. This is very good against many Link strategies such as Unchained because you need face-up monsters to Link Summon, and it gives you a way to clear Links with a non-destruction-based effect. 3&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Rollback</strong>. This allows you to pay half your Life Points to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your opponent's GY. However, you can also banish it from your GY and pay half your Life Points to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your GY. This means you can copy Ghastly Glitch for another pop, Imperm for a monster negate, Karma Cannon to deal with your opponent's board, or even Necro Fusion for another Fusion Summon. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Judgment</strong> for protection purposes.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Colorless, Chaos King of Dark World</strong>. It requires&nbsp;<strong>Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World</strong> and 2 or more Fiend monsters. This is easily achievable in Lady of Lament with the Deck being able to put Versago into rotation to substitute from Reign-Beaux and the Lilith being able to Tribute off the Fiends you Summoned from Ties of the Brethren in order to put Fusion Material in the GY for Necro Fusion to Summon out Colorless. On Fusion Summon, Colorless destroys all cards your opponent controls. This is especially nice with you Summoning on your opponent's turn with Necro Fusion. It also gains 1000 ATK/DEF equal to the number of Fusion Materials used to Summon it, but that isn't that relevant unless we take into account the Virus Traps of which we are siding 1&nbsp;<strong>Eradicator Epidemic Virus</strong>. Also, it can Quick Effect discard a card and make a face-up card you control untargetable by your opponent's effects for the turn. It isn't much of an effect, especially since our Deck mostly has set Traps on field and Lilith Tributes off most of your monsters eitherway, so the best target you have for Colorless is itself, which still isn't much. 1&nbsp;<strong>Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World</strong>. This requires&nbsp;<strong>Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World</strong> and a DARK monster for Fusion Material, but again, this is achievable with Versago. If your opponent activates a monster effect or a Normal Spell/Trap, it can change the effect to ""your opponent discards 1 card"" which effectively nullifies or negates that effect depending on how you look at it. This is very helpful for stopping board breaker cards like&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Storm</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong> which are bad match-ups for your Deck depending on how you open. 1&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Triphyoverutum</strong> which can negate a Special Summon from the Extra Deck and destroy those monsters, and it can Special Summon itself back grom GY if your opponent controls a monster with a Predator Counter. This is in here as a Super Poly target as it does require 3 DARK monsters on field as Fusion Material. 1&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Dragostapelia</strong> which requires a Fusion Monster and a DARK monster for Fusion Material and can Quick Effect place a Predator Counter on a face-up monster your opponent controls and it negates all activated monster effects of monsters your opponent controls with a Predator Counter. 1&nbsp;<strong>Despian Proskenion</strong> which can be Summoned off of Granguignol's effect. It can Quick Effect target a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link in your opponent's GY and either banish it or summon it to yoru field. And if it destroys a mosnter by battle, it can inflict damage to your opponent equal to the destroyed monster's ATK or DEF, whichever is higher. 1&nbsp;<strong>Granguignol the Dusk Dragon</strong> which requires&nbsp;<strong>Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous</strong> and a LIGHT or DARK monster which is very achievable, again, due to Versago. If it's Fusion Summoned, it can dump a Level 6 or higher LIGHT or DARK monster from your Deck or Extra Deck. The only realistic target we have for this effect that actually does something is Garura for a draw, but you can play other options like&nbsp;<strong>Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</strong> if you really wanted. And when your opponent Special Summons a monster by an activated monster effect, you can banish Granguignol from field or GY to summon a Despia from Extra Deck or a Dogmatika from Deck. Our only target is Proskenion, which is still probably the best thing you could do. 1&nbsp;<strong>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Mudragon of the Swamp</strong> for Super Poly targets. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong> along with 1&nbsp;<strong>Downerd Magician</strong> to play alongside your 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Number 49: Fortune Tune</strong> for Zeus plays. 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong> to Rank-up Darius into for interruption if you draw Tour Guide and have no real other plays. 1&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong> just to be able to Link off Doomdog to search Lady Labrynth.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops</strong> as free Summons from hand that you can use to boardclear. 3&nbsp;<strong>Super Polymerization</strong> for more board clears, and it fits the whole Fusion aspect of the Deck well. 2&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Terrors of the Overroot</strong>. 1 <strong>Eradicator Epidemic Virus</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched.</strong></span></p>"

But with some of that support being given out to Resonators and ""Archfiends"" and/or Fiends in general (if you can categorize them like that), it gives some nice cards that work well with another Fiend strategy, that being Lady of Lament. The cards from that debut in the Structure Deck which are featured here include&nbsp;<strong>Bone Archfiend</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Vision Resonator</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Fiendish Golem</strong>, but you can also include&nbsp;<strong>Scarred Dragon Archfiend&nbsp;</strong>as well. This isn't so much of a Red Dragon Archfiend Deck as it is more of a Lady of Lament Deck making use of some of the new Red Dragon Archfiend support while still retaining some ability to go into&nbsp;<strong>Red Dragon Archfiend</strong> and associated Synchros to some degree. There are some benefits to playing this Deck, but they don't make the Deck any much more of a consideration over your average Lady of Lament Deck. This is just an idea I was tinkering with and the product was pretty good to a degree.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3&nbsp;<strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong> which can reveal itself in hand to give all of your Set cards destruction protection while it is revealed. And if you activate a Set Spell/Trap, you can Special Summon it from hand, and if it was already revealed in hand when you do so, you can set a Spell/Trap from Deck. Lord gives a lot of utility, being protecting your Set Spell/Traps from destruction while also being an easily summonable, large body that can also get you any Spell/Trap directly from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Bone Archfiend&nbsp;</strong>which can send a card from hand or field to GY in order to Summon it from hand or GY which then locks you into DARK Dragon Synchro Monsters from the Extra Deck. It being this easy to Summon plays extremely well with its next effect. On field, you can target a monster you control with a Level and send a Fiend Tuner from hand or Deck to GY to increase or decrease that monster's Level by 1. This means that you can turn this Level 4 DARK Fiend monster into a Level 3 DARK Fiend monster on field. This means that you now have a target on field for&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> to get your Lady of Lament monsters out from the Deck. And what's even better is that it doesn't even need your Normal Summon. Sure, it locks you into Dark Dragon Synchros out of the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn, but you can just Normal Summon like a Tour Guide right before that, go into&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong> and rank him up into&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong>. And it gets even better when you realize that you can send&nbsp;<strong>Vision</strong><strong> Resonator</strong> from Deck with it. We are playing 2&nbsp;<strong>Vision Resonator</strong>. You can make the argument to play only 1 as you can add it back with&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong>, but that is ONLY IF you want to add it back with Crimson Gaia. Crimson Gaia adds any card that lists RDA from Deck or GY which means you can search other cards that are better in the moment. But back to Vision Resonator, if you control a Level 5 or higher DARK monster, you can Special Summon it from hand, and if it is sent to GY, you can add a Spell/Trap that mentions RDA from Deck. Our only options are&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Fiendish Golem</strong>, but those are good enough in the context of this Deck and I will explain why once we get to the Spell/Traps of the Deck. However, since Vision Resonator is also a Tuner, it is our way to access Red Dragon Archfiend and its other Synchros in the Extra Deck. It and a Level 4 Bone Archfiend get you to&nbsp;<strong>Red Rising Dragon</strong> which brings back Vision Resonator to go into a Level 8 like&nbsp;<strong>Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</strong> for functionally a boardwipe. Or since we are siding Bystials, Vision Resonator, who is a 2, Synched with a Level 6 Bystial, immediately gets you to a Level 8 RDA Synchro for the same purposes. Then, we are playing 1&nbsp;<strong>Sangan</strong> which searches a monster with 1500 or less ATK when sent from field. Sangan can be Tributed off of Lilith or sent from field for Bone Archfiend, but the most important part about it is that it can search a monster for follow-up. 3&nbsp;<strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> which is a Quick Effect to Tribute a DARK monster to reveal 3 Normal Traps in Deck and have your opponent randomly choose 1 for you to Set to your field. This is a great way to access Traps, especially since you are also playing monsters who benefit off of either being Tributed, sent from field to GY, or sent to GY in general. Then, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong> who Special Summons a Lady of Lament from GY on Normal Summon which can include itself. This means that if you send a Lady of Lament from hand to Special Summon Bone Archfiend, you can Normal Summon Alice to get it back, and if it happens to be Lilith, it's as if you activated&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong>, but you didn't and still got everything that you needed on field either way which is really nice. You can also banish a Trap from hand or GY to Special Alice from hand, and if it is Tributed, you can add a Fiend monster from Deck to hand whose combined ATK and DEF equal to 2000. Your only option in this Deck is Lilith, but simply just having a Lilith for next turn is already pretty good. Also, you can search another Alice for follow-up next turn with Sangan if you have the option to. And finally, 2&nbsp;<strong>Tour Guide From the Underworld</strong> which Special Summons a Level 3 Fiend from hand or Deck on Normal Summon. This card is basically a 1-card Rank 3 which translates into a Machinex if you decide to go for Darius. And to reiterate, you can Normal Summon Tour Guide and go into an Xyz before you Special Summon Bone Archfiend which functionally gives you more interruption in Machinex while also having a Level 3 DARK Fiend on field as a target for Ties.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3 <strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong> which targets a Level 4 or lower monster on field and Special Summons 2 monsters from Deck with different names that have the same Level, Type, and Attribute as the targeted monster. This gives you access to all of your Lady of Lament monsters, giving you Lilith access with Tribute fodder for her effect as well. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong>. It is a Continuous Spell that can add an RDA or a card that mentions it from Deck or GY to hand each turn. This means that it can add back Vision Resonator to possibly go into a Synchro play or search/add back <strong>Fiendish Golem</strong> to recur Trap options for removal as it does mention RDA.&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong> also allows you to change all monsters your opponent controls to face-down Defense when an RDA declares an attack, and if a monster(s) is destroyed by battle or card effect on field, it can Special Summon an RDA from GY. These effects are really good. You wouldn't be using the second effect of Crimson Gaia that much in this Deck specifically, but being able to Summon back an RDA from GY pretty constently is really powerful, considering that we can bring back Scarlight for board clears almost every turn, in case it is outed the first time around. 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Archfiend's Ghastly Glitch</strong> which allows you to target and destroy a card on field if you control a Fiend monster, and afterwards, it allows you to send a Fiend from Deck to GY. Being able to destroy any card on field with a Trap that is not once per turn is really good, especially with the added option of sending a Fiend from Deck. This means that you can send an additional copy of&nbsp;<strong>Vision Resonator</strong> to possibly search another&nbsp;<strong>Fiendish Golem</strong> if you already did not get all copies of it out of the Deck or Crimson Gaia if you did not already search it. 1&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Rollback</strong> which allows you to pay half your Life Points to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your opponent's GY, but you can also banish it from your GY and pay half your Life Points to copy the effect of a Normal Trap in your GY. What's even better is the fact that you can send it from hand to Summon Bone Archfiend, giving you access to its grave effect, which is arguably better than its effect when activated on field. 2&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Fiendish Golem</strong>. This card allows you to target a monster with 2000 or more ATK and banish until the End Phase of the next turn, then, if you controlled an RDA or a Synchro that mentions it when you activated this card, you can set a <strong>Fiendish Chain</strong> from Deck or GY. It's not the most impressive card, I will admit. You are not getting rid of a monster for good, and you are limited to only using it on monsters with 2000 or more ATK which is why I am comfortable playing it at 2 and not at 3. Besides, you can add it back from GY with&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong> eitherway. And if you really wanted to be cute, you could play 1&nbsp;<strong>Fiendish Chain</strong>, but I feel it isn't necessary with the fact that we are already playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> with&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Rollback</strong> in this Deck. Also, we are basically almost never going to be Summoning RDA or an associated Synchro monster in our regular combo for this Deck. If anything, the RDA Synchros that we are playing in this Deck are more for turn 3 and beyond in the case of going first to have a way of reducing your opponent's Life Points to 0 and/or clearing their board. Or for turn 2 in the case of going second to clear threats on your opponent's board. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Torrential Tribute</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong> to send off of&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>. Garura gives you a draw while N'tss pops a card on field. 1&nbsp;<strong>Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</strong>. It's name becomes Red Dragon Archfiend while on field or in GY which means that you can bring it back with&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong> which is really nice. Also, as a soft once per turn, you can destroy as many Special Summoned Effect Monsters on field with ATK less than or equal to this card's and inflict 500 to your opponent for each monster destroyed. The reason why I mentioned the soft once per turn is because, in the case of your opponent negating and destroying the activated effect of Scarlight,&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong> can just bring it back and you can try it again. Scarlight gives you a really nice way of dealing with monster threats on your opponent's board on a follow-up turn or going second. 1&nbsp;<strong>Scarred Dragon Archfiend</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Red Dragon Archfiend</strong>. Scarred's name becomes Red Dragon Archfiend on field or GY which, again, means that&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Gaia</strong> can bring it back from GY. If it is sent from the Monster Zone to the GY, you can Special Summon the 1 <strong>Red Dragon Archfiend</strong> that we are also playing in our Extra Deck (and this is treated as a Synchro Summon), and then, if it was used as Synchro Material fro a DARK Dragon Synchro Monster, you can destroy all Attack Position monsters your opponent controls. Okay, so here is the deal. We are playing Scarred Dragon Archfiend to have a large body that we can Summon from the Extra Deck that can float into another large body. HOWEVER, please remember that <strong>Red Dragon Archfiend</strong> will destroy all monsters you control that did not declare an attack this turn during the End Phase. Even if it can destroy all Defense Position monsters your opponent controls after damage calc of a battle in which it attacked a Defense Position monster, you really have to be careful about doing things like Summoning monsters during Main Phase 2 or having small monstes on your field that were able to get over your opponent's monsters or attack your opponent directly during the Battle Phase because RDA will just blow all of them up. This is just a reminder to be careful of when you are using Scarred Dragon Archfiend to Summon Red Dragon Archfiend from your Extra Deck. If you choose to do so, you may end up destroying your board instead. 1 <strong>Red Rising Dragon</strong> which is a Level 6 Synchro that can be made with Vision Resonator and Bone Archfiend. When it is Synchro Summoned, it can summon back a Resonator from GY, that being Vision Resonator, giving you access to a Level 8 Synchro, being an RDA Synchro of your choice in this Deck. 1 <strong>Golden Cloud Beast - Malong</strong> which returns a face-up card your opponent controls to the hand when sent to GY, making it a good send off of <strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky </strong><strong>Thunder</strong>. 1 <strong>D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong> which can be ranked up into with Darius and it can attach a Monster Card your opponent controls that activated its effect to itself once per chain by detaching 2 materials, and if you Summon it with Darius, you usually get 2 activations of Machinex. 1&nbsp;<strong>Downerd Magician</strong> to give Zeus more material. 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong> which can make itself indestructible in a battle and destroy your opponent's monster instead, which makes it a good choice to go into Zeus with, but it can also rank-up into Machinex of course. 1&nbsp;<strong>Number 49: Fortune Tune</strong> for the same reason to make Zeus. 1&nbsp;<strong>Unchained Soul Lord of Yama</strong> which is a Link target for&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong> as it can banish tiself when a card you control is destroyed by battle or card effect to Summon a Fiend from hand or GY. And finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Bystial Magnamhut</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Bystial Druiswurm</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Bystial Baldrake</strong>. I would be playing things like&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Fenrir</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Pankratops</strong> in this slot, but in order to go with the whole Red Dragon Archfiend theme of the Deck, I decided to put the Bystials here in order to give you an easy Level 6 body to Summon from hand with that can be Synched with Vision Resonator to go into an RDA Synchro. But even so, the Bystials on their own are pretty good as they can remove DARK or LIGHT monsters from your opponent's GY. During the End Phase that Magnamhut was Special Summoned, it can add a Dragon from Deck or Gy to hand. Druiswurm sends a Special Summoned monster your opponent controls to GY if it is sent from field to GY, which is very easy to do in this Deck as you can just Tribute it with Lilith's effect. And Baldrake can Tribute another LIGHT or DARK when your opponent Special Summons a Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link to banish 1 of those monsters, and it Tributing can trigger Alice's effect to add off of being Tributed. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Storm</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>. And 3&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Judgment</strong>.</span></p>"

In the early game, you'll focus on using cards like ""The Melody of Awakening Dragon"" to search out your ""Blue-Eyes"" and its alternative counterpart. Simultaneously, ""Trade-In"" and ""Dragon Shrine"" help establish your graveyard and cycle through your deck. ""Sage with Eyes of Blue"" serves a dual purpose: searching for key tuners and initiating combos. As you transition to the mid-game, you'll aim to establish a dominant board presence with Synchro monsters like ""Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon"" and Xyz monsters such as ""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"". These monsters not only offer offensive capabilities but also disrupt and negate your opponent's strategies. ""Return of the Dragon Lords"" acts as a linchpin, reviving your fallen Dragons while shielding them from harm. As matches progress, rely on your Extra Deck for adaptability, and don't forget to strategically side in counters after the first game to tackle specific opponent threats. Mastery of this deck comes from maximizing the synergy between your powerful Dragons and the suite of support cards tailored to elevate their strengths.</p>"

The deck also has one supporting engine, the Frightfur Patchwork Engine.&nbsp;<br class=""ContentPasted0"" /><strong><br /></strong><strong>CHIMERA </strong>creates is a simple and solid gameplan in itself with it's boss monster - Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts. While it is on the field, it's name is ""Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast."" In the GY, Mirror Swordknight and Cornfield Coatl (sent to the GY as part of the combo) offer some targeting protection (Coatl) and monster effect negation (Swordknight). Berfomet and Gazelle nab resources from deck when summoned and used as fusion material. The deck's fusion card, Chimera Fusion, recurs itself from the GY if Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast is on the field or GY (which is always the case). Everything in this archetype grabs resources and recurs itself in this deck so you can keep fusion summoning and interrupting your opponent! When your opponent is out of resources, Chimera can wait one turn on a full board to OTK your opponent - the only Runick variant easily able to do so.&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>RUNICK </strong>offers the main win condition of this deck by banishing your opponent's deck. It also can summon a level 2 to start off your Spright combo in the form of Runick Hugin while simultanously searching for Runick Fountain, allowing you to draw up to three cards. Runick spells also break opponent's boards fairly well when played correctly in tandem with the other archetypes. Runick offers has solid defensive, with Hugin protecting against destruction effects while Geri dissuades the opponent from attacking. The new Fusion monster from DUNE in the Runick arsenal, Sleipnir functions as both a resource generator and almost like a ""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer/Little Night) banishing an opponent's monster once per turn, which is an excellent defensive and offensive card. Chimera makes great use of the tokens it generates as additional fusion material. Sleipnir and Geri are also beasts, which&nbsp;coincidentally fulfills the fusion requirements for&nbsp;Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts.&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">The <strong>FRIGHTFUR </strong>patchwork engine is an excellent addition that synergizes perfectly with this deck. Edge Imp Chain is also a fiend, which coincidentally fulfills the fusion requirements for&nbsp;Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts</div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span style=""font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span style=""font-weight: 400; margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">&nbsp;</strong></span></strong></div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">The strategy of Chimera Runick is to control/banish your opponent's cards until they surrender or deck-out. In certain situations, you can also enter the battle phase and begin taking apart your opponent's board with Chimera fusion monsters and the new Generaider from DUNE, Sleipnir. The ridiculous resource advantage and control options each archetype gives the duelist should win them the duel in most circumstances.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""margin: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"" style=""margin: 0px;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""margin: 0px;"">The Chimera engine provides incredible advantage through just one Mirror Swordknight. It is a net +7 after playing on your own turn and your opponent's turn! After concluding the comboline this engine usually does, you'll have Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts on the field, with Mirror Swordknight on the field ready to tribute itself on your opponent's draw phase for more searches.

It is perfect for those of us who like to self-insert themselves into our duels with an over-active imagination and bring out the ""RP"" in Role-Playing Games!&nbsp;<br /><br />That's why I looooove making variants of Runick - and Runick's newest addition to it's archetype arsenal is Chimera! Chimera meshing extremely well with Runick is a definitely a treat for an oldschool Yugi-boomer like me, since it gives some of my favourite cards from the DM era (about 23 years ago!) meta relevance!<br /></span></div><div style=""font-size: 12px; margin: 0px; text-align: left; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff;""><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif; margin: 0px;""><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></span><span class=""ContentPasted0"" style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin: 0px; font-size: 12pt;"">GLHF Duelists! <br /></span></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You want to get two Gateway on the field + Mass Driver and have at least one Sam monster on the field already. The idea is that you basically loop the double Gateway with something like Grandmaster by consistently throwing it into the grave with Driver, getting it back with the Gateway and then summoning it back to do the loop all over again. The loop if perfect is pretty much game-ending if they have no signficant backrow removal in response.&nbsp;</p><p>The awesome thing about this deck in theory is that because Gateway doesn't actually target, the usual counters to something like this don't work, making it pretty much a one and done. You play Trunade to clear backrow, you play Starlight Road to protect any backrow that does get targetted, you play also a lot of searching/+1 cards to run through your deck faster to boot. I'm not 100% with the deck yet in terms of structure and I do think it can be drastically improved, which is why it's not mentioned as a full on deck yet. I do think it's a fairly competent threat if it starts well enough off with the first few draws, so there's that at least, and Six Sam can be played pretty well conventionally to boot so the deck doesn't fall apart without the burn stip.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Did you know that it debuted in Labyrinth of Nightmare back in 2003/2004? Certainly we can expect some interesting cards because of that fact alone. Today we analyze this Deck in all of it's Detail and explain why I play&nbsp;Amazoness Blowpiper&nbsp;even so it seems to be awful, let's start:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""color: #404040; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, 'helvetica neue', Arial, 'noto sans', sans-serif, 'apple color emoji', 'segoe ui emoji', 'segoe ui symbol', 'noto color emoji'; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgba(167, 164, 164, 0.18);"">Note that a Bug prevents me yet again from using card tooltips alltogether.

A little note at the start. 100% play&nbsp;Amazoness Archer&nbsp;since it's allowed in TCG and pretty good in dealing 1200 - 3600 effect Damage in a single Turn. As for Master Duel we play&nbsp;Amazoness Spy&nbsp;instead but enough of that and back to the topic: What does this Deck even want to do?&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Fusion summoning is the Answer and a lot to be true. That's why we play a 24 Monster 16 Spell/Traps ratio to have enough Monsters ready to be fused. From that position Amazoness has a simple OTK line with&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;or a more fancy way with reverse burn alias&nbsp;Amazoness Swords Woman. With&nbsp;Amazoness Archer&nbsp;there would even be a burn option but that's limited to TCG only. Certainly not as straightforward as War Rock for example and that's why Amazoness is actually a good Deck.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>The Call for War Commences&nbsp;</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Every Deck needs starters and with&nbsp;Amazoness Princess&nbsp;,&nbsp;Amazoness War Chief&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist&nbsp;they have 9 Monsters which get things started. All of them are primarily focused on searching your Spell &amp; Trap lineup.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">With&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;they have a Quick Play Spell which searches anything with Amazoness in it's name and with&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;,&nbsp;Fusion Substitute&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Secret Arts&nbsp;they have a total of 6 Fusion Spells.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">All these cards equal 18 cards which really get this Deck up to speed easily and are pretty essencial to any kind of Amazoness Deck.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Gathering the Amazoness Tribe&nbsp;</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Next up we take a look at the Maindeck Monster lineup in more Detail. At first sight there seems to be a few very suspicious cards but we will get to them don't worry:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Queen</strong>: L6 with 2400/1800 Statline. Amazoness Monsters can't be destroyed by Battle. A simple yet effective permanent effect which includes herself. She can prepare a&nbsp;Amazoness Swords Woman&nbsp;Reverse Burn OTK or Mass Backrow Removal with&nbsp;Amazoness Sage&nbsp;if&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;is used to make a Monster able to attack all Monsters from the opponent. Furthermore there's synergy with&nbsp;Amazoness Empress&nbsp;which can search or revive this card and she is also one of the targets to enable 2 attacks for&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;or can be used to make a&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King. Certainly&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;proofes to be quite important within this strategy.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness War Chief</strong>: L5 with 1900/0 Statline. She has 2 HOPT's (Hard once per turns). If you control no Monsters or only Amazoness Monsters you can special her from the hand. If normal or special summoned you can set a Amazoness Spell/Trap or&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;from the Deck. Her search is immune to&nbsp;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&nbsp;and she's yet another target to summon&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King&nbsp;easier. She does prevent your non Amazoness Monsters from attacking that turn too. She's all around useful and a very welcome addition to speed up your Deck.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Paladin</strong>: L4 with 1700/300 Statline. Gains 100 ATK for each Amazoness you control. She starts out with 1800 ATK and caps at 2300 ATK with her own effect. Having&nbsp;Amazoness Village&nbsp;and the 2 Pendulum friends active will make her a 3300 ATK Normal Summon. She's a easy to summon chonk which can be lethal if combined with the GY effect of&nbsp;Amazoness Call. Never underestimate this lady since even the almighty&nbsp;Blue-Eyes White Dragon&nbsp;will bow before her (With the right setup).&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Swords Woman</strong>: L4 with 1500/1600 Statline. The opponent takes the Battle Damage you would've taken from Battles with this card. I'm so glad this card exists since it's an easy out for a big Chonk problem. Have&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;or&nbsp;Amazoness Empress&nbsp;active and use the GY effect of&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;to win against massive Boards which would otherwise be impossible to get around by simply attacking into stronger Monsters.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Chain Master</strong>: L4 with 1500/1300 Statline. When destroyed by Battle you can pay 1500 LP to take a look at the opponents Hand and choose a Monster from there to add to your Hand. Talk about unique effects this is something very interesting. By crashing into an opponents Monster or simply setting her (And hoping for the best) you get the full knowledge of the opponents Hand and can steal a vital Monster from him too. Suddenly you can play with&nbsp;Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring&nbsp;,&nbsp;Nibiru, the Primal Being&nbsp;or&nbsp;Maxx ""C"". All that precious Handtraps will be yours and the opponent might just scoop out of anger. Since this card is old it's missing a Once per turn. If you see multiple Monsters in the opponents Hand use&nbsp;Amazoness Willpower&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;Amazoness Onslaught&nbsp;with&nbsp;Amazoness Golden Whip Master&nbsp;combined to get this effect up to 3 times in one Battle Phase. Certainly not cheap with 4500 LP paid plus Battle Damage but also pretty much an inescapable Situation for the opponent as well.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Trainee</strong>: L4 with 1500/1300 Statline. Monsters destroyed by Battle with her are returned to the bottom of the Deck and she gains a 200 ATK permanent increase too. Nowadays the GY is more important then ever and having a card which prevents certain Monsters from entering that place is more important then you might think. Trust me Spright Monsters are better to be far away at the bottom of the Deck. The list of applications for her is long indeed.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Sage</strong>: L4 with 1400/700 Statline. If she attacked and is still on the field at the end of the Damage Step target a Spell/Trap from the opponent and destroy it. Again using the GY effect of&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;to give her multiple attacks can achieve multiple Spell &amp; Trap removal which is nice but obviously convoluted since cards like&nbsp;Infinite Impermanence&nbsp;or&nbsp;Called by the Grave&nbsp;do exist and how Backrow acts nowadays pretty much everything can be chained. Then again against Pendulum, Equip or Permanent effect based Strategies she can work wonders so she's an nice to have option just in case.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Tiger:</strong> L4 with 1100/1500 Statline. Only one&nbsp;Amazoness Tiger&nbsp;can be on your Field. Gains 400 ATK for each Amazoness you control and the opponent cannot attack another Amazoness Monster. He starts with 1500 ATK and caps at 3500 ATK. With&nbsp;Amazoness Village&nbsp;and the 2 Pendulums active he will have 4500 ATK as a normal summon Monster. Having that is already strong but there's even a hidden Trap you can setup with him. Imagine you control 3 - 5 very weak Amazoness Monsters to lure the opponent into the Battle Phase. He attacks but you activate&nbsp;Amazoness Archers&nbsp;to weaken the opponents Monsters and force them to attack. Now activate&nbsp;Amazoness Onslaught&nbsp;and special summon&nbsp;Amazoness Tiger. Suddenly the opponent is forced to attack your massive Tiger and most likely OTK himself in the process, nice. I always liked this Tiger and even so&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King&nbsp;can achieve something similar it's still the most effective with the OG Tiger.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Blowpiper</strong>: L3 with 800/1500 Statline. During your Standby Phase target a opponents Monster and reduce it's ATK by 500 until the End Phase. And here it is the most suspicious Card in this Deck, let me explain. It may be wise to setup her during the End Phase of the opponent with&nbsp;Amazoness Willpower&nbsp;or an&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;summon and then use her effect on your turn or otherwise protect her with&nbsp;Amazoness Empress&nbsp;or&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta. 3000 ATK is a very common Statline among Boss Monsters and with her you get that down to 2500. Not only can a&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger&nbsp;then get over said cards it also enables a possible OTK in these Situations. If you setup&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger&nbsp;or&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King,&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Blowpiper&nbsp;with an active&nbsp;Amazoness Village&nbsp;on the field (Which is pretty common) and at the start of the Battle Phase he only controls his 3000 (Now 2500 ATK) Monster, thanks to blowpiper you will deal a total of 8200/8300 damage instead of 7700/7800 and achieve an OTK. Yes you could just use something like&nbsp;Amazoness Paladin&nbsp;instead but the fact you can bring down the ATK of an opponents Monster first makes it more versatile then initially visible to be able to even clear certain threats from the opponent.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Spy:</strong> L3 with 800/1200 Statline. Reveal one Amazoness in Hand to special her from the Hand. When destroyed by Battle you can target a Amazoness in the GY other then&nbsp;Amazoness Spy&nbsp;and return it to the Hand or Deck. Being able to special her can setup a tribute summon from the Hand or bring&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist&nbsp;into play easier. Being able to return a Monster to the Deck is good to be able to summon it with&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;from there again and returning it to the Hand for obvious reasons. She is the next best option after&nbsp;Amazoness Archer&nbsp;in the support lineup that's why she has found a place in this Strategy for OCG/Master Duel reasons. Note that only her first effect is a HOPT so the 2nd effect could be looped just like&nbsp;Amazoness Chain Master's effect too. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Princess</strong>: L3 with 1200/900 Statline. Is treated as&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;while on the field or in the GY (Giving her almost the same applications as the OG&nbsp;Amazoness Queen). On Normal/Special summon she searches any Amazoness Spell/Trap to the Hand. If she declares an attack you can send another card from Hand or field to the GY to special a Amazoness from the Deck in defense except&nbsp;Amazoness Princess. She's your Nr.1 Starter for sure with a HOPT search for any Amazoness Spell/Trap. The ridiculous part is that her 2nd effect is not a once per turn. Banish&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;so that she may attack all Monsters (Best with&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Onslaught&nbsp;active) and start generating advantage. First attack: Summon&nbsp;Amazoness War Chief&nbsp;to set another Amazoness Spell/Trap or&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;, Second Attack: Summon&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist&nbsp;to search&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;, Third Attack: Summon&nbsp;Amazoness Baby Tiger&nbsp;, Fourth Attack: Summon whatever you like and resummon&nbsp;Amazoness Baby Tiger. Main Phase 2 = Fusion summon an unstoppable army of Monsters. She really brings the whole Amazoness Tribe together.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Scouts</strong>: L2 with 500/1100 Statline. Quick Effect: Tribute her, neither player can target Amazoness Monsters you currently control with Monster effects or destroy them by card effects this turn. She's a very nice Monster to be summoned before passing your turn. She can protect a lonely&nbsp;Amazoness Empress&nbsp;or&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;very well which do protect all other cards and in general&nbsp;Amazoness Scouts&nbsp;becomes versatile because of the Quick Effect nature. Just beware using it during your turn since you also can't destroy/target your own Monsters then.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong>: L2 with 500/500 Statline. Is treated as&nbsp;Amazoness Tiger&nbsp;while on the field or in the GY. Can be special summoned from the Hand or GY if you Normal/Special summon an Amazoness Monster (HOPT). Gains 100 ATK for each Amazoness Card in the GY. He's a great recurring fusion Material and can be used to summon&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger&nbsp;which needs an&nbsp;Amazoness Tiger&nbsp;as fusion Material. He also continues to grow stronger the bigger your GY grows which can make him annoying to Deal with in Duels which take several turns.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Spiritualist</strong>: L2 with 800/1800 Statline. Has 2 HOPT's. You can return a Amazoness card you control back to the Hand to special her from the Hand or GY (Limits to Amazoness Extra Deck summons for the rest of the turn). If special summoned you can search&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;from the Deck to Hand. She's simple yet effective in setting up Fusion plays and is yet another recurring Threat each turn. She also enables great Loop Potential. Use&nbsp;Amazoness Village&nbsp;as bounce target to summon her without loosing your Normal summon. Use her to bounce&nbsp;Amazoness Willpower&nbsp;for another usage and trigger&nbsp;Amazoness Village&nbsp;in the process. Reuse&nbsp;Amazoness Hall&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Hot Spring&nbsp;every turn or reuse the search effects of&nbsp;Amazoness Princess&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness War Chief. This card is absolutely useful and versatile and I'm really liking her.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Golden Whip Master&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Amazoness</strong> <strong>Silver Sword Master</strong>: L5 with 2000/1200 &amp; L3 with 1200/2000 Statline. Pendulum Scales 1 &amp; 7. Pendulum Zone Effects: If an attack is declared involving a Amazoness Monster Golden Whip can target and destroy any Spell Trap on the field and Silver Sword can recycle a Amazoness Spell/Trap from the GY back to the Hand (HOPT). They both give each Amazoness 100 ATK times their Level. Monster Effects: They both can be placed into the Pendulum Zone if destroyed by Battle or Card effect. If a Amazoness is Special summoned while they are in the GY they can be placed into the Pendulum Zone (Both effects are HOPTs). </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">They are great Fusion Materials since they end up in the Pendulum Zone after that. They can create a 5200 ATK&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;which then easily OTKs with her ability to attack Twice. They also create a great ressource Loop for the in Archetype Spell &amp; Traps and can remove your own&nbsp;Amazoness Onslaught&nbsp;to trigger a revival effect during the Battle Phase. Their next advantage is the Ability to Pendulum summon all Main Deck Monsters easily onto the field and even other copies of themselves from the Extra Deck back to the field. Finally cards like&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King&nbsp;can destroy them without loosing any advantage. In total these 2 Pendulum Monsters are a great help for the Amazoness Tribe.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">And that's all for the Monsters up next is the Backrow.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Magic Moments in the Village&nbsp;</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Polymerization</strong>&nbsp;needs no explanation but&nbsp;<strong>Fusion</strong> <strong>Substitute</strong>&nbsp;may need one. It's always treated as&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;(Even during Deck Building) and can only use Monsters from the field but it can also banish itself from the GY to return a Fusion in your GY back to the Extra Deck and draw one card. This is easily done in this Deck and getting easy access to Draw and Recycling is a very nice option.&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;is still easier to use so we play 2 of them and only 1&nbsp;Fusion Substitute. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Village</strong>&nbsp;is a Field Spell that has already been mentioned often by now. Amazoness Monsters gain 200 ATK and once per turn when a Amazoness is destroyed by Battle or Card effect you can Special a Amazoness from Deck with an equal or lower level.&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Willpower&nbsp;are 2 easy ways to trigger this effect outside of the Battle Phase and&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist&nbsp;may then bounce it to be able to use this effect again during the Battle Phase. Certainly needs a little setup to be used optimal but it's worth the effort.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Call</strong>&nbsp;searches any Amazoness Card from the Deck or sends it to the GY (Useful for&nbsp;Amazoness Secret Arts) and can be banished from the GY to target an Amazoness Monster which then can attack every Monster from the opponent once but only that Monster can attack that turn. This card can only be activated once each turn but it's a quick play spell. I mentioned this card during the Monster section many times for good reasons. This Card is as essencial as&nbsp;Amazoness Princess. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Secret Arts </strong>is a quick play Spell that works like Polymerization but for Amazoness Monsters only. You can banish this card from the GY to be able to send a Fusion Monster from the Extra Deck to the GY as Material if you Fusion summon this turn as a one time effect. Only one effect of Amazoness Secret Arts can be used per turn and only once that turn. Quite limited but also quite devastating this card enables quick effect fusion summons at any time and easy lines into Amazoness Augusta. It can be recycled each turn with Amazoness Silver Sword Master unlike Polymerization which can't be reused in this Deck. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Archers</strong>&nbsp;is a normal Trap that can be activated when the opponent declares an attack and you control an Amazoness Monster. Force all Monsters from the opponent to attack position (Flip effects are not activated), they loose 500 ATK permanently and have to attack if possible. If you use&nbsp;Amazoness Secret Arts&nbsp;to turn a weak Monster into a big Boss after using this card it's pretty likely the opponent will OTK himself from that position. This card is quite devastating but obviously as a Battle Phase trick also limited in it's usability. Still this card can be a very unwelcome surprise for the opponent and it's pretty fun to resolve successfully.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Willpower</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;Call of the Haunted&nbsp;but for Amazoness Monsters and that Monster has to attack if possible and can't change it's Battle Position. Reuse this card with&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist&nbsp;each turn and trigger&nbsp;Amazoness Village&nbsp;in the process to really start generating advantage with this otherwise pretty normal card.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Onslaught</strong>&nbsp;used to be a centerstone of attention before the Strategy shifted to Fusion summoning but is still very strong. It's a permanent Trap that can special a Amazoness from Hand during the Battle Phase and give it a 500 ATK Boost until the End Phase. After damage calculation if an Amazoness Battled you can banish the opponents Monster. If destroyed you can revive a Amazoness from the GY. No limitations on this card and non targeting banishing are what makes this card so strong. Be sure to have it ready with&nbsp;Amazoness War Chief&nbsp;,&nbsp;Amazoness Princess&nbsp;or&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;if you need it. Destroy it with&nbsp;Amazoness Golden Whip Master&nbsp;for a reborn and then use&nbsp;Amazoness Silver Sword Master&nbsp;on a follow up attack to recycle it for next turn. You may also use&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King&nbsp;to trigger a double reborn that way (One with Onslaught one with Liger King).&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Hall</strong>&nbsp;is another permanent Trap which on activation can recycle a Amazoness from the GY back to Hand or from the Extra Deck into the Pendulum Zone. If the opponent specials a Monster while you control a Amazoness Monster you can target it and gain LP equal to it's current ATK. That's a HOPT. The part I already mentioned is the Loop potential with&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist&nbsp;but the Fact that Amazoness actually have a card that generates LP is amazing. Do you remember&nbsp;Amazoness Chain Master&nbsp;who has a nifty LP cost or the self damaging Attacks with&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Princess&nbsp;or&nbsp;Amazoness Sage&nbsp;combined? Thanks to this card you can actually manage to survive in these moments which makes this card great to have. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Hot Spring</strong>&nbsp;is the final permanent Trap that on activation searches a Amazoness from Deck to Hand or places it in the Pendulum Zone. If you take Battle Damage and you control a Amazoness Monster you can gain LP equal to the Damage you took. That's a HOPT. The 2nd piece in the Puzzle which prevents you from reaching 0 LP easily but doesn't actually generates any LP plus. Instead it has an search which once again can be reset with&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist.&nbsp;Amazoness Hall&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Hot Spring&nbsp;help out a lot in the post turn 2 survivability for the Amazoness Tribe.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">That's the Main Deck done. Onto the Extra Deck!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Princess &lt; Queen &lt; Empress &lt; Augusta</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Like I said earlier the overall Amazoness Strategy shifted to Fusion summoning but are these Monsters worth it? Let's find out:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Augusta</strong>: L10 with 3200/2800 Statline. Needs a Amazoness Fusion Monster and any other Amazoness as Material. The opponent can't target other Amazoness cards with card effects and he also can't destroy them by card effects. If this card is Fusion summoned with&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;or&nbsp;Amazoness Empress&nbsp;she can attack Twice. If Fusion summoned you can special a Amazoness Monster from the Deck. That's a HOPT.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">This card is the strongest Amazoness of them all and can easily OTK the opponent if at least one Pendulum Monster is active. If you summon her twice every Amazoness Card including herself is immune to targeting and destruction from the opponent, your backrow included. The cherry on top is the Fact she brings out another Amazoness from Deck if she's fusion summoned which makes her even stronger. Truly a magnificient Boss Monster and the absolute strongest Amazoness of them all.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Empress</strong>: L8 with 2800/2400 Statline. Needs&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;and any other Amazoness as Material. Other Amazoness Cards can't be destroyed by Battle or Card effects. Amazoness Monsters inflict piercing damage. If this card is destroyed by Battle or leaves the field through an opponents card effect you can special a&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;from Hand, Deck or GY.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Second in command she has a notable difference in her protection effect. It applies to your effects too so a&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King&nbsp;is unable to use his effect if he doesn't target&nbsp;Amazoness Empress&nbsp;itself. Just like&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;two copies of&nbsp;Amazoness Empress&nbsp;will prevent any Amazoness Card from being destroyed by Battle or Card effect, backrow included. Enabling piercing for all Amazoness Monsters makes cards like&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;with&nbsp;Amazoness Call&nbsp;combined even more dangerous. Her floating effect is able to summon the OG&nbsp;Amazoness Queen&nbsp;from the Deck or&nbsp;Amazoness Princess&nbsp;from Hand/GY on top of her other already strong effects. She's pretty strong especially with&nbsp;Amazoness Augusta&nbsp;combined.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Pet Liger</strong> <strong>King</strong>: L9 with 2900/2800 Statline. Needs a L5 or higher Amazoness and any other Amazoness as Material. The opponent can't attack another Monster. You can destroy any Amazoness Card on your field (Him included) to revive a Amazoness Warrior Monster from the GY but&nbsp;Amazoness Pet Liger King&nbsp;can't attack that turn and it's a HOPT. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">He's easy to be summoned with six L5 or higher Monsters in the Main Deck and more in the Extra Deck. He can create a perfect attack Wall if you control him twice or with&nbsp;Amazoness Archers&nbsp;combined force the opponent to attack him. After all with Pendulum Setup he has 4700 ATK which is more then enough to make the opponent finish himself. The revival effect is great to trigger&nbsp;Amazoness Village&nbsp;since the ""and if you do"" in his card text won't make Village miss timing. Overall he has the role of both an great extender and defender. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Pet Liger</strong>: L7 with 2500/2400 Statline. Needs&nbsp;Amazoness Tiger&nbsp;and any other Amazoness as Material. If he attacks you can make him gain 500 ATK during Damage Calculation only. If an Amazoness Monster attacked you can target an opponents Monster and permanently decrease it's ATK by 800. The opponent can't target other Amazoness Monsters for attacks.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The difference in his attack lock is that he protects Amazoness Monsters only. 2 copies will create an attack lock which excludes&nbsp;Missus Radiant&nbsp;who's there to strengthen all your Monsters and enable more Recycling. The ATK decrease sounds weak but we even play&nbsp;Amazoness Blowpiper&nbsp;so we are in deep with this ATK decrease Strategy and he certainly helps out a lot in that regard. This can trigger multiple times at once and has no limitations so reducing opponents Monsters to 0 ATK is very possible.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">With the Boss Monsters done it's time to talk about the less nice things.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>War around the Village at it's Climax</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Time for the usual Weakpoints analysis. Amazoness like every Deck is not perfect. The whole Spell &amp; Trap removal is attack based which means a card as simple as&nbsp;Swords of Revealing Light&nbsp;can completely stop you in your Tracks. In these cases the TCG Decklist with the added&nbsp;Amazoness Archer&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;Amazoness Spy&nbsp;has a realistic way to victory left but as for this List it looks a bit dark for you then. Adding generic Extra Deck Monsters is a easy solution but don't forget the limitations which&nbsp;Amazoness Spiritualist&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness War Chief&nbsp;create.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Non targeting removal also bites this Strategy a lot since there's no protection against that even with your Bosses. Quick effect Fusion Summoning with&nbsp;Amazoness Secret Arts&nbsp;is an interesting way to deal with that problem at least a little bit. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The Final problem is banishing.&nbsp;Macro Cosmos&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dimension Shifter&nbsp;don't make playing impossible but any kind of backup Plan is done for with these cards active.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Outside of these 3 major problems the rest looks pretty shiny and good for this Archetype. Unlike other Battle Phase oriented strategies Amazoness has plenty of options and protection available and can win in different creative ways my favourite being stealing&nbsp;Nibiru, the Primal Being&nbsp;with&nbsp;Amazoness Chain Master&nbsp;to use him on the opponent to then crash&nbsp;Amazoness Swords Woman&nbsp;into the Chonky Nibiru Token.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Final Speech from the Queen</strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Amazoness is fun and unique (I noticed I often write this) but really, cards like&nbsp;Amazoness Chain Master&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Swords Woman&nbsp;which Scream Duel Monsters era make this Deck so special. If you like Fusion Monsters and Battle Phase related strategies which still have plenty of options available this Deck is made for you.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">I like Amazoness and you can actually easily go into Diamond and beyond with this Strategy. They are simple on paper but devastating in practice from my experience and that's why I appreciate them^^&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Final Rating:&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★★ OTK Potential </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★☆ Defensive Tools </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★☆☆☆☆☆ Control Options </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★☆☆☆ Removal Options </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★★ Recovery/Recycling </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">★★★★★★☆ Card Advantage </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Overall Rating: ★★★★★☆☆&nbsp; 32/42★</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Laws of the Empress </strong> </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Like always there are certain rules you should know about which are listed down here: </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Queen</strong>: This is an permanent effect.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness War Chief</strong>: 1. The special summon is an effect. 2. If you set a Quick play Spell you cannot activate it in the same turn.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Swords Woman</strong>: This is an permanent effect. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Chain Master</strong>: 1. The opponent has to show his Hand. If there's no Monster nothing will happen after he showed his Hand. 2. The stolens Monsters original owner is still the opponent. If it's discarded or sent from the field to the GY it returns to the opponents GY.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Trainee</strong>: A Monster destroyed from this card never touches the GY.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Sage</strong>: This effect always activates mandatory even if there's no target.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Tiger</strong>: If for some reason both&nbsp;Amazoness Tiger&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazoness Baby Tiger&nbsp;are on the field at the same time the last Monster which was summoned of these two is sent to the GY.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Blowpiper</strong>: 1. This effect is mandatory and applies even if this card leaves the field. 2. If this card leaves the field and is resummoned during the Standby Phase it's effect will trigger again.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Spy:</strong> The special summon of this card is an effect.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Princess</strong>: The 2nd effect has no limitations whatsoever.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Scouts</strong>: If a Monster already targets an Amazoness and you chain this effect, the effect which targets will resolve normally.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Baby Tiger</strong>: While you control&nbsp;Amazoness Tiger&nbsp;this card can't be summoned.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Spiritualist</strong>: Special summoning this card is an effect.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Golden Whip Master:</strong> You can target and destroy your own Spell/Traps </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Silver Sword Master</strong>: General Pendulum rules say a Pendulum Monster is placed face up in the Extra Deck if it would be send from the field to the GY. From Hand and Deck it will be sent to the GY normally.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Fusion Substitute</strong>: This card is always treated as&nbsp;Polymerization&nbsp;even during Deck Building.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Village</strong>: This card can miss timing. Note that words like ""and"" and ""and if you do"" won't make this card miss timing.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Call: </strong>Using the GY effect twice in the same turn on the same Monster gains no benefit.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Secret Arts</strong>: The GY effect sends a Fusion Monster from the Extra Deck to the GY as Material. That Monster in the GY can't be revived to the field but can be returned to the Extra Deck with other recycling cards.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Archers</strong>: 1. The ATK decrease is permanent. 2. Only Monsters currently on the field will be forced to attack.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Willpower</strong>: You have to enter the Battle Phase if you control a Monster summoned with this card and you have to attack if possible.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Amazoness Onslaught</strong>: 1.

Alongside ""Primal Seed"" and ""Number 92"", it will be extraordinary! Let's get started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Reach the board state as illustrated:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/mS4yagU.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon and place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone. This setup is essential to find spells needed with ""Primal Seed"", as long as you target each other.</li><li>Risebell was Special Summoned by Saryuja. Alternatively, you can discard him with Dugares/Ravenous and revive with ""Monster Reborn"".</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Destroy Risebell and Saryuja with ""Offerings to the Doomed"". You need to empty three Main Monster Zone (MMZ) for Number 43/92 and one MMZ for Risebell. Then, place either Number 43 or Number 92 on EMZ when you have met conditions by raising level of monsters revived with ""Monster Reborn"":</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/mSZ0jOI.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/wVqXbic.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/Pd7naLj.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/ommYAba.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>At one point, don't forget to play ""Contract with the Void"". It's needed to increase the ATK of Number 92, which you will see why. Don't forget to set ""Primal Seed"" before playing ""Contract with the Void"" to not send ""Primal Seed"" into Banish Zone (BZ) by accident.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) Destroy Number 92 with ""Offerings to the Doomed"". Then, Special Summon it by its ability and you can increase its ATK with respect to number of banished cards, multiplied by 1000:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/pXgdMqJ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) Finally, play ""Mystik Wok"" and target on Number 92. By gaining lots of LP, you can reflect the amount gained as burn to FTK your opponent thanks to Number 43 to seal the game:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/UUfCySQ.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/h3SAc1C.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/xqtMh4H.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/MZuIt00.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>If you want to watch the deck in action, click <a href=""https://youtu.be/oMyIcgn_PL8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here!</strong></a></li><li>If, for some reason, you face an opponent which gained lots of LP, try adding ""Overlay Regen"". After the destruction of Number 92, you can revive and attach onto Number 92 to repeat what was done in #3 and #4. Since Number 43 and Number 92 don't have ""hard once per turn"" abilities, you can repeat the setup explained in last two steps as many times as you like by destroying and reviving these two monsters with Offerings and Reborn.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Springans Merrymaker,"<p>Greetings! In this deck, we will try to make biggest C9. Thanks to ""Springans"" archetype based on attaching XYZ monster of their kind, it will be piece of cake. Let me explain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-6_Yp4LqUw"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Have ""Springans Merrymaker"" present on the battlefield. However you want to form two level 4 monsters and overlay each other is up to you.</p><p>2) With the arrival of Merrymaker, you can attach five of your Springans monsters. They have to be in field/hand/GY to attach onto Merrymaker...</p><ul><li>Note that when you XYZ Summon Merrymaker, you can send one of your Springans from your deck to GY. It's as if you activate ""Foolish Burial"", no?</li><li>Two of your Springans, called Branga + Sargas, can be sent to GY with ""Trade-In"" and you can draw 2 cards for each.</li></ul><p>3) When all of your Springans are attached into Merrymaker, it's time to build a ladder leading up to C9. Here is the order: Merrymaker &gt;&gt;&gt; Astral Force &gt;&gt;&gt; Dice Games &gt;&gt;&gt; Argent Chaos Force &gt;&gt;&gt; Number C6 &gt;&gt;&gt; Astral Force &gt;&gt;&gt; Number 9 &gt;&gt;&gt; Argent Chaos Force &gt;&gt;&gt; Number C9</p><ul><li>If you don't want to craft Dice Games due to fact that it costs UR, you can substitute with ""Number 25"", which costs N. However, you have to target Merrymaker with Reprodocus/Scroll of Bewitchment and change its attribute into LIGHT to continue with Astral Force as usual.<ul><li>Instead of Number 25, know that Number 6 is also a thing but it costs UR.</li></ul></li><li>If you don't want to craft 2 x Astral Force, substitute one with ""Spell Reproduction"", which costs R. With that, you can retrieve your Astral Force from GY and continue as usual.<ul><li>Same thing can be also done with ""Magical Stone Excavation"" but it costs UR, mind you.</li></ul></li></ul><p>4) If you have done everything correct, C9 should have 11 materials in total. Trigger its both abilities to deal 11 x 300 + 11 x 800 = 12100 damage in total to FTK your opponent with C9.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- Here are the cards you don't have to craft, if you don't have any or looking for substitutes...</p><ul><li>2 x Trade-In &gt;&gt;&gt; 60 UR</li><li>1 x Musical Sumo Dice Games &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 UR</li><li>1 x Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 SR</li><li>3 x Chicken Game &gt;&gt;&gt; 90 UR</li></ul><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force"" can be found within any of three Secret Packs below to save 30 UR...</p><ul><li>Altered Heraldry</li><li>Colossal Mech</li><li>Timeworn Legacies</li></ul><p>- ""Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number C6"" can be found within ""Timeworn Legacies"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 9"" can be found within ""Colossal Mech"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Springans Merrymaker"" can be found within either ""Alba Abyss"" or ""Echo Chamber Nation"" Secret Packs to save 30 SR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 240 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

The Mikanko engine is in my opinion a straight improvement over the Renaud or Armageddon Knight engines since Arabesque is an utterly broken card which allows you to play through your opponents board or bounce back the Gen/Ken summoned to your opponents field or utilise your deadweight Bardiche while simultaneously enabling your combo by special summoning a Lv3 Warrior that comes back twice thanks to the other 2 Mikanko equips.</p>"

It can be done by using Number 13 as Link Material for Saryuja.</p><p>2) Revive it with ""Monster Reborn"" and follow it up with ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"" to bring forth Number 43.</p><p>3) Special Summon Eldlich with his ability. Then, Special Summon ""Banisher of the Light"" with Saryuja.</p><p>4) When you have played ""Into the Void"" beforehand while holding all three ""Golden Land"" traps, set ""El Dorado Adelantado"" and end your turn.</p><p>5) On your opponent's turn of Draw Phase, activate ""El Dorado Adelantado"". Since you have banished all three different named ""Golden Land"" traps as face-up, you can reshuffle them back into your deck to halve your opponent's LP and gain the same amount.</p><ul><li>To not miss any timing, change the activation confirmation button to ""ON"". You can check these options in-game, where you can choose ""Switch + Hold"" to manually go back and forth between required setup upon pressing the button.</li></ul><p>6) The amount of LP gained will be enough, since it's equal to your opponent's current LP. Pull the trigger with Number 43 for fatality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Eldlich"" + ""Cursed Eldland"" can be found within ""Immortal Royalty"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"
