Do you like Gren Maju, banish cards gain a lot LP and ATK. But you think in these times with this deck I won't win with anyone. Nothing more wrong, with a good idea you can do a lot. And this is the most beautiful in YGO new life old cards.

You are guaranteed to end on six negates, if not more - and since card li","So we're nearing to the end of the month now - and that made me think, which doesn't happen quite often. As I lay on my mattress, I pondered over what new and interesting list I could make. What new, never-ever seen before strategy I could come up with in order to end January with a bang! So that's why today: we are making a deck that's been played for over 10 years! Infernity is one of the first ever decks that allowed you to end on crazy boards, using the same three cards over and over. They are in many people eyes the best archetype to come out of 5ds - understandably enough. It can end on crazy boards like borreload savage, two-three infernity barrier, one infernity break &amp; a 4-counter apollousa. And that is just with a simple hand. Open godly and you're guaranteed to get a solid 8 negates on board. Don't believe me? Then try this build out yourself and see exactly what I mean. So without wasting any more valuable time - here's the list:

If you have been living under a rock for roughly all of 2012 - Infernity is a deck centred around not-having card advantage..? Most of the infernity monsters truly pop-off when you don't have any cards in hand. This is crucial in the combo - meaning you want to get rid of your cards as fast as you can. That  is mostly why we run a 9 card danger engine. Saryuja really saves this deck - meaning you go into him as much as possible. Think of him as a magical mallet on Crack...down - if you don't open well enough, just keep resetting your hand until you do! The main cards you need for the combo are Avenger, Archfiend and Necromancer. What you essentially want to do is just keep bringing them back and slowly setting up negates. Before you consider setting up backrow, always see if you can create a Borreload Savage and Void-Ogre Dragon. If you play your cards - and know roughly what you're doing - this will be achievable with most hands. After you've used up your Infernity Launch, the way you get them back is Infernity Mirage. You should usually try and use his effect as much as possible - but once you've ran out of way to play him, you should do what you do best and synchro into Hundred Eyes Dragon. This allows you to keep spamming the effect of Mirage even after you cannot use him. Once you have used Infernity Archfiend's effect to the point where there are no more zones available for your trap disruptions - you can simply tune off the Necromancer and Avenger into Herald of arc light.

Besides that - there's not much to say about this build. It does it's job well and can play through some tough situations. You can side out Thousand-Eyes Restrict if you want to, as I mainly run it for situational filler and for the Clotheep combo that you sometimes opt for. This deck is a hard 8.7/10. It's very rare that you'll see this deck brick, and you can usually end on some crazy boards, but if you open incredibly poorly or simply don't have the knowledge to pilot this deck - you're in for an irritating time. This deck has been relevant for a while - and I can see why. Kalin is to this day one of the best characters introduced - and has an archetype that can practically achieve anything. I can see this deck being rogue for a long, <em>long, </em>time..."

My task was to build Anime character decks just using the cards that were printed in the Yu-Gi-Oh card game. This also meant that I would have to add cards to make certain monsters playable. The best example would be, at least for this deck, is Zombie Warrior, who is a Fusion Monster in the real-life card game. So, I had to include it's Fusion Materials: Skull Servant and Battle Warrior. This deck includes cards from Yugi's Blackland Fire Dragon and some of the cards used in Yugi's Special Deck from his first duel with Yami Bakura. I say ""some"" because I'm not sure if I put all the cards in that deck in this deck due to the Deck and Side Deck Limit on YGOPro. This deck was made possible by the information on Yugi Muto's Decks page on Yugipedia."

-cherubini send carboneddon

-link into needlefibre, summon serpent

-banish carboneddon, summon hunter dragon

-link both dragons into elpy/pisty

&nbsp;

u end on the same board u did with ib, from there combo as u wish.

there's also a bunch of ways to do the combo with any 2 monsters.

&nbsp;

also tzolkien is in here cause master rule 2020, and its really easy to get him out using galactic spirals 'turn evth into lvl8 eff' (careful tho, as u need to send the cards for tzolkin to grave, so it doesnt work with spiral/destrudo if they were summoned off their own eff). best board i could manage was 3neg apol, borrelsavage equip saryuja, titanic, dawn dragster and crystal wing.

budget options:
<ul>
 	<li>borrelsavage -&gt; void ogre (only neg spell/trap, need no hand to be live)</li>
 	<li>appol -&gt; hieratic seal + koaki drago or amorphage (can be better in some scenarios, forces u to run a garnet tho</li>
</ul>
hoping for needlefibre to not be too expensive and a cherubini reprint until then.."

Meklord in 2020? Oh boy, here we go. Using the popular Scrap engine, not only it can trigger the Meklord Emperor or search it, the board will end on a legit setup like Topologic Bomber with Gizmek Orochi in GY which also can trigger the Meklord Emperor. I will explain the Scrap setup combo.

Before starting, it is the best to search Emperor Wisel or place Meklord Fortress first. Your best card and main starter is Scrap Recycler. Normal summon Recycler, send O-Lion/Gizmek (prefer O-Lion so you dont have to pay Gizmek cost), link summon Wyvern, ss Recycler destroy Recycler, ss Golem destroy Fortress, search Emperor Wisel through Fortress destruction, ss Recycler using Golem, send Gizmek via Recycler again, link off Golem+Recycler+Wyvern for Bomber.

The rest of the cards are handtraps, extenders, or breaking board cards. MST/Twin can trigger Fortress. Phantazmay, Chaos Hunter, and Gizmek can be summoned during opponent's turn which if they destroy it with card effect, we can ss Emperor Wisel from hand.

Gozaburo Kaiba is the crazy stepfather of Seto Kaiba. In the Virtual World Arc in season 3 of Yugioh Duel Monsters Gozaburo and Kaiba had a legendary grudge match and Gozaburo used a Exodia Necross Deck combined with elements from his Chess piece match against Kaiba. Gozaburo full deck wasn't shown, he only played a few cards so i used my own creativity and pulled from the new Exodia Support Yugioh Set Legendary Decks 2 to help build the deck. My anime themed character decks are NOT meant for Yugioh Official Tournament play, fun play only. The link below shows the legendary duel between Gozaburo Kaiba and Seto Kaiba so you can see why Gozaburo Kaiba's deck is built the way it is.

Fortune Lady Every, Slacker Magician and Downerd Magician are in the Extra deck. The spells/traps in the deck are mostly for Fortune Lady cards with a few cards for Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu. With the cards Sunny Pixie, Solitaire Magician and Fortune Lady Past the Xyz summoning of Slacker Magician and Downerd Magician is easier. The Xyz monster Slacker Magician gives a strong defence, where Downerd Magician can follow up with a strong offence. The more important spell/trap cards are Future Visions which can trigger Fortune Lady light's ability to special summon a Fortune Lady monster from your deck and Inherited Fortune which can special summon stronger Fortune Lady monsters. Tribute summoning Fortune Lady Water for Fortune Lady Dark is a good combo, where after destroying a monster can special summon Fortune Lady Water and allow you to draw two cards. The spells Time Passage and Synchro Boost are important early on for keeping Fortune Lady monsters alive, so they can gain strength during your standby phases. All the monsters are spellcasters, except for Earthbound Immortal Aslla Piscu, so cards like Solidarity, Yami and Dwimmered Path are good. Carly Carmine is my favourite character in YuGiOh 5D's and these are many of my favourite YuGiOh cards.

Monsters. Getting Zombie World and Doomking out is the first thing you should try to do. ,"Most of the time you have two tasks. Get zombie world out and then Doomking Balerdroch. Uni-Zombie, Gozuki gives you fast access to everything you need. In theory you have 8 ways of getting Zombie World on the field. 3 Copies, Terra forming, Banshee, Uni-Zombie, Gozuki, Foolish Burial. Danger! allows for faster access to these cards and graveyard set-up. If a Zombie world is placed use any searcher to get Glow up in the graveyard to trigger its effect. The extra deck and most other cards are just for interruption and breaking boards. Superpoly is a great removal again with Zombie World. Vampire Sucker in theory, too. But most of the time use it to draw cards. Mezuki not been a once per turn allows for great swarming if the graveyard is properly filled. Staples can variate if preferred.

At Kame Game, Yugi is preparing his Deck for the Duel tournament, when Sera enters the store. She notices the <a title=""Millennium Puzzle box"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Millennium_Puzzle_box"">Millennium Puzzle box</a>, which Yugi had been keeping his cards in and comments that is pretty. Yugi tidies it away and informs her that it is not for sale.

Sera shows him the Prana Realm with the seven pillars and then takes him back to the store. She has now disappeared, but Yugi opens the puzzle box and finds the piece of the Millennium Puzzle that Aigami had given to Sera.

At the space station, the computer has almost finished reassembling the Millennium Puzzle, but reports that two pieces are missing. At first, Kaiba says that this is impossible, but then realizes that Aigami must have taken them when he put his hand through the glass.

&nbsp;

<span>TURN 1 BLUE-EYES IS YOUR STRATEGY</span>

You need no other strategy

<span>KAIBA WAS THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE SHOW</span>

This is why blue-eyes.

&nbsp;

I don't need to tell you how to play this. I learned to play the game 6 hours ago. It isn't complicated, read the cards and you're good.

<span>READING IS THE MOST ALPHA</span>

Blue-eyes and the ability to summon them is the entire goal. If you don't attack every single time you can, you are playing incorrectly. Ideally you would have a 60 monster deck, but I tried that and it didn't work."

I didn't count while playing with it on YGOPR","You will want to go first with this deck, but you can still get a pretty decent game when going second.

I made an example of a simple 2 card combo with this deck: https://youtu.be/RbjRPsH28m8
Of course, you can do a lot better with more cards, this is just a demonstration of the basic combo.

Going First: You should go after putting Plasma, Sunrise and Absolute Zero on the field and, if possible, set a Mask Change so you can replace the Absolute Zero with Acid (most times it's only possible if you have it on your opening hand, but some times you will be able to keep your normal summon for later and use Liquidman to summon Shadow Mist from the GY), cleaning the opponent's field when you need (if you don't get Mask Change, remember you still have Sunrise to protect your Plasma from an attack or even to banish your own Absolute Zero so the opponent won't have any monsters left, but please, avoid doing that second option). Depending on your hand, you won't be able to do that, but if that's the case, try going after putting Plasma and Dark Law, this way your opponent probably will only get rid of one of them by battling, which means you would survive the 2nd turn and can try to OTK on the 3rd, or they will totally brick, which most times means a win.

Going Second: You should go after putting Malicious Bane and Sunrise on the field, and, if the opponent has some really problematic monster effects, you should put Plasma too. Now you should decide if you are either going to clean the field with Malicious Bane or if you will go after Absolute Zero (if you have Mask Change, you will probably want to use Absolute Zero, since when you summon Acid you will also get rid of the opponent's spells). If your opponent has a deck that focuses on the GY, Absolute Zero probably won't be an option, since you will want to get Dark Law on the field too. If you are facing a monster that's unaffected by card effects and can't be destroyed, go after Trinity and Honest, deal the most damage you can, and if the opponent survives, try replacing Trinity with anything more useful for the next turns.

I like this profile the way it is and honestly, I think it shouldn't be changed, but here are some cards that can be changed: Ultra Polymerization, Monster Reborn, 1 of the 2 Sunrises (I run 2 because sometimes it can help assure that you will trigger its effect when attacked, but you still can change it with something else), Blast (but I DO recommend you to at least put it on the side deck, it can help you a lot when playing against Mystic Mine) and Core. You shouldn't change anything else.

Since many people make this mistake, here is a reminder: This is a combo deck, so you shall not put any hand traps on it. Having hand traps on this deck will increase the chances of you getting a bricked hand, also, this deck does have the power to OTK even if the opponent makes his perfect play (except if on a mirror match or against Mystic Mine since they both will block your game, but still, no hand traps)."

 	<li>You'll usually have at least one hand trap to stop your opponent from getting their full combo.</li>
 	<li>Nibiru can set you back a little bit depending on if you only have Bullet Train in hand, other than that, its not too hard to get rid of their token with either Derricrane's or Gangaridai's effect.</li>
 	<li>You can use a Kaiju on their biggest remaining problem monster, summon Gustav and burn for 2k. After that, destroy a problem monster with Derricrane's effect from being detached as material, or overlay into Liebe and punch for 6k (multiple times on monsters mind you). Game.</li>
 	<li>Anger Knuckle is good for card recursion and when paired with Bullet Train lets you get whatever Machine monster you want back to hand. I usually go for either Pegasus or Jizukiru depending on the situation.</li>

The only problem this deck has is Nibiru, but if everything goes well, you only need to summon 4 times to make Liebe."

Get out Dark Magical Circle and a way to recur Dark Magician in order to beat interrupt your opponent, clear the field, and eventually beat them down with the Emo Mage.

In order to protect your back row based strategy we have, even more back row. Judgement can be used to negate everything, crack down can steal important monsters, and secret village stops that all so annoying twin twister and lightning storm.

To get to your play we have a lot of draw cards, ranging from the spell book engine, allure of darkness, and metalfoes fusion along with the normal draws of Magicians' soul and soul servant to make sure you have your play makers.

Through testing the deck did have an issue though, it lack the ability to take out big untargetable boss monsters. As a non meta example we have something like Blue Eyes Chaos Max Dragon, since it have 4000 attack you can't beat it over with your main strat, since it's untargetable you can't banish it. So what's the out? In the main you would have 2 options, kaiju or borrelsword. These help beat over such troubling issues for the decks that can bring out those types of beasts. When going against decks specializing in this sort of boss the side deck includes cards such as Dark Ruler No More, and Super Poly to get rid of them.

Some choices that many be questioned is the inclusion of Destrudo as well as the synchro monsters.

While Destrudo himself has little synergy with the deck his ability to make the deck go beyond what it is already capable of can not be ignored. He can easily be used to fusion summon out Dragon knight to protect your back row and then go into a lv 7 synchro, be it either Arcanite to destroy cards or F.A. Dawn Dragster to negate cards the next turn. If these play are not an option and he ends up as a brick he will at least always serve as a target for allure of darkness."

Works in MR 4 and MR 5. ","I was inspired for this deck by a Youtube video called ""<strong>Earth Toolbox 2019</strong>"".
It featured a going 1st deck with different earth-engines to stun the opponent.

I thought about some more cards, that could fit into this deck and ended up on a going 2nd strategie with some changes to the original deckbuild.
Ofc this is no competetive deck, but for Rogue matchups it works pretty well.

With the latest Banlist I had to make some changes. Brillant Fusion got banned and Pankratops got limited.

I just cutted the Brillant engine and added two Linkslayer inetead of the Pankratops

Here is a description of the engins and support cards:

<strong>Rock-Engine:</strong>
One good winning condition is the <strong>Block Dragon</strong>, that searches us two lvl-4 rock-monsters to go into <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. As targets i choose 3 <strong>Gigantes</strong> and one <strong>The Rock Spirit</strong>, because they can be specialed easily.

<strong>Insect-Engine:</strong>
The main reason for this is <strong>Gokipole</strong>, that can search and special a normal insect monster and remove one Monster from the field without targeting or destroying. To trigger its effect, we got mill cards, i.e. <strong>Resonance Insect</strong>, wich can also search <strong>Kaijus</strong> or <strong>Doom Dozer</strong>. So we got one more removal and XYZ/Link-Material.

<strong>Combo Starter/Extender:</strong>
<strong>Mathmatician</strong> and <strong>Rescue Rabit</strong> are good normal summons that start our combos. We can enable the Insect-engine by milling <strong>Gokipole</strong>, get extenders like <strong>Dotscaper</strong> or <strong>Glow-up Bulb</strong> into the graveyard or just go into a Rank 4. <strong>Gallis</strong> is a free potential special summon and can mill more combo pieces.

Going-2nd-cards:
<strong>Pankratops</strong> and <strong>Kaijus</strong> to remove opponents monsters. Linkslayer is also a free Special summon, Cyberse-type for the <strong>Curious</strong> and can destroy your opponents spells/traps.

<strong>Spells:</strong>
These are combo starter/extender. <strong>Kaiju Slumber</strong> is a removal and search tool and <strong>Double or Nothing</strong> is needed for winning with <strong>Utopia Double</strong>.

<strong>Extra Deck:</strong>
Can be chanced depending on the opponent or meta.
<strong>Curious</strong> is an important combo piece to mill specific cards. <strong>Saryuja</strong> can be used to draw more cards while using weak monsters for the link summon. <strong>Bagooska</strong> is a nice Going-1st card. <strong>Granite</strong> can search our Block Dragon and became more imprtant, because the Brillant Fusion is banned now.

You can add any Rank 4 or Link-monster you want.
Here are some examples:
<strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> works perfectly in this, but its a bit more expensive.
<strong>Abyss Dweller</strong> can be an easy win, depending on the matchup.
<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> is a good interuption in your opponents turn, but also a non-budget-card."

Uses the Zaborg self-pop strategy. ,"Gishki is one of my favourite Yu-Gi-Oh Archetypes for its history: it used to be notorious for FTKs, Hand Loops and generally degenerate strategies. The way these happened also had a very large effect on card design in general; the implementation of Once per Turn Clauses and forcing Anti-Search tech cards to be printed. On top of all this, it was a big part of Duel Terminal lore and still gets stuff relating to that today: look at the new Shaddoll Support! These days it's somehow still got things it can do, although it is quite gimmicky in general. This deck aims to OTK the opponent in...a rather elaborate way.

My deck uses Gishki Zielgigas primarily, so it's important to understand what he does. He'll give you a free card - and a free non-targeting send to the deck if you draw a Gishki Monster - in exchange for 1000 LP. Given Gishki Aquamirror can bring him back to the hand if there's a Ritual in the grave, using a Zielgigas to summon another is a very reliable strategy: with enough ways to get the Aquamirror back, this can be an effective loop until you have only 1000 LP left.

The aim of the deck is to abuse the hell out of this, digging through the deck for as many extenders as possible. This can be done through Salvage to get Shadow and Vision to loop, Surface for a free summon (Vision into Link plays), Avarice or Moray of Greed for draws, Impcantations for a free Zielgigas summon, and more. There are tons of resources the deck burns through to build a small but powerful board. Once the loop is finished and 2 Zielgigas are on the board, you can either attack with them and go into Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max to burn for game, or use Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula to boost your attack to an upwards of 10k and instantly win.

The new banlist was very important for this deck, as it banned Thunder Dragon Colossus, the greatest threat to the deck. It also brought back Pot of Avarice which is extremely abusable due to the graveyard getting stacked with monsters very quickly. In terms of recent sets, the release of Marincess Coral Anenome and Clotheep (although the latter has yet to be imported to the TCG) also gave the archetype much-needed extenders to combos, further bolstering its potential to keep going during a loop. <strong>Until Clotheep is released in the TCG, replace it with Borreload Dragon and Sky Cavalry Centaurea. </strong>These cards help the deck in removal, although they are definitely not as helpful.

As a side strategy, I've got Zaborg, the Mega Monarch, in my deck. Using this and sending Elder Entity N'Tss, Toadally Awesome and Herald of the Arc Light to the grave gives a humongous plus in card economy. With this, you get more than enough resources to loop and then even make a board. The best way to dump him on the board is with multiple Zielgigas on the field while Aquamirror is in the grave, or after using some Impcantations.

In the case that Zaborg is either unavailable or you don't feel there's a good situation for the self-pop, there are alternative Normal Summons;
<ul>
 	<li>Deep Sea Diva enables you to end on a Herald to force banishes, although this card can be cut for alternate cards.</li>
 	<li>Beautunaful Princess brings out Gishki Abyss for a search, this can be used with One For One for a virtually free search.</li>
 	<li>Gishki Abyss searches the entire archetype, most notably Gishki Shadow and Vision who can start the Zielgigas Loop.</li>
 	<li>Gishki Beast can bring back a Gishki, which is useful during a loop.
<ul>
 	<li>Abyss for a search, and then a Link play.</li>
 	<li>Shadow for a Rank 4 play, you can use Abyss Dweller or Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir through this. He can also help squeeze out a Zielgigas</li>
 	<li>Vision is worse than both of these in terms of Extra Deck plays but can help squeeze out another Zielgigas.</li>
 	<li>All of these can bring out the new Clotheep, who greatly assists in loops due to being able to Draw 2 and then discard Rituals for Aquamirror or Vision to use with Surface. This also enables Marincess Coral Anenome, who can bring back Abyss for another search, although you can't use your Rank 10s after.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Zaborg can also be removed in exchange for Vanity's Ruler, another powerful 2-tribute monster who can win games on its own due to locking the opponent out of Special Summons. Side decking it is valid, but it's not always necessary.

The deck does have flaws, especially in that going second is pretty much all it can do. The deck lacks any protection whatsoever, and while it can play through negates if it opens well (in fact it can easily go through 2 or 3 in some cases), having your key cards removed is common. This is why I define the deck as blind second, as a Gishki board is one of the most fragile in the game. You can use Mound of the Bound Creator to protect Zielgigas, but two pops are all it takes to oust that. Droll &amp; Lock Bird is also devastating to the deck, causing the draw loop to come to a swift end. As a result, Called by the Grave an imperative side deck card. If you want something to stop yourself from getting screwed over by going first, it is fine to add Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora into the Extra Deck.

In terms of matchups, I'm not entirely sure as the format has basically been reset. In a general sense, the deck does well against any that doesn't;
<ul>
 	<li>Lock you out of Special Summons (Summon Limit is a common ""you can scoop now"", True Draco carries it frequently too which doesn't help)</li>
 	<li>Have a ton of removal (Dinosaurs tend to mow the deck down in this department, but going second usually makes this part less of an issue)</li>
 	<li>Pile on more than 3ish negates (Pendulum opening well is a big problem here)</li>
 	<li>Prevent Searching (Thunder Dragon Colossus is banned so this is pretty much a non-issue now)</li>
</ul>
What, that's a good bunch of decks? Well, I never said this was gonna be very meta relevant. I do think it's a Rogue Deck, but I am a touch optimistic. Gishki does very well against decks with large boards and little recovery, as Zielgigas can just wipe away any dangerous cards with good draw luck. It can play through a good few negates if it opens well (although some hands can be virtually unusable in the face of multiple negates), which makes this strength much better.

Yugioh DM season 1 and season 4 focused on Mai's Harpie cards and she essentially used a Harpie themed anime deck in season 4 when she was controlled by Dartz.  Mai received new support for her deck 2 years ago in the Yugioh Set Legendary Duelists: Sister Of The Rose which included strong new support for her harpie character deck. I incorporated Mai's new support cards into her deck. My Anime Themed Character Decks are NOT meant for Official Yugioh Tournament play, fun play only. The link below will show the duel between Mai Valentine vs Joey Wheeler in season 4 of Yugioh to show why her deck is built the way it is. 40 card main deck, 15 card side deck.

Currently, the deck can end with anywhere between 3-5 Negates on board between traps and monsters, with the main combo being as follows:
If you have Necro Slime, Swirl Slime, and Lamia (or Dark Contract with the Gate in place of any of these) + 1 Dark Contract or D/D card in hand (unneeded if you have used Dark Contract to get your 3rd monster needed), you go through these steps.
1.  Use Swirl Slime to fuse wit Necro Slime to make Flame King Genghis
2.  Summon Lamia
3.  Syncro Genghis with Lamia to make Gust King Alexander
4.  Use Necro Slime in grave to fuse with King Genghis to make High Flame King Genghis
5.  Trigger Gust King Alexander on Genghis' summon to special summon Lamia from grave
6.  You CAN trigger Genghis at this point on Lamia's summon, but you should not do so.
7.  Synchro Lamia with Alexander to create Sigfried.
8.  Trigger Genghis on Sigfried summon to special summon Gust King Alexander from the graveyard.
9.  Activate Lamia in grave, sending either a Dark Contract on field or a D/D or D/D/D monster in hand to grave to special summon her

But that's not true! Salamangreat still stands strong - and,"Are you afraid that your favourite budget meta decks have been murdered ruthlessly by Konami? Have you invested into a Salamangreat core - only to see your beloved stallio get heartlessly sent to the shadow realm? Well do not threat young duelist - I, along with literally <em>everybody</em> else, have crafted a brand new deck theory! Play Salamangreat like never before with an extra deck card that's guaranteed to never get hit on the banlist: Dante! While it may not be the most optimal version of the deck there was, it's the best you've got! So without delaying, here's my list of spicy furries!

So the banlist came into effect a couple of days ago, and my have people lost their minds. I mean - some people are even saying Spyral is the best deck in the format! What? It keeps getting consistent tops?! Oh uh...as I was saying, Salamangreat are still one of the toughest control decks out there! One thing you might notice that is slightly odd, the ratios just dont add up! Your previous one-of traps are now played at 3, and your falcons, peacocks and dogs are all at 2 now. Well, with Miragestallio sadly gone - you cannot simply search out your level 4's. So you play the next best thing and main two copies of Dante. With the fact that we now run a mill card in the deck - you want to play the enslaved two ratio, in order to still be able to search after your monster has been milled.

Two new cards that you might find are Solemn Strike, and Armored Bitron. Armored Bitron is a fairly new card that was announced - and allows you to special summon any cyberse monster from your deck - except its effects are negated. You run this card as a means of setting up strong boards after you make your combo turn 1. The reason its strictly a turn 2 card, is because it locks you out of summoning Dante for the rest of the turn. So you primarily use him to have monsters for Avramax. And of course - the solemn package is simply extra trap card disruption to promote your opponent scooping.

In conclusion, Salamangreat is far from dead. With this list - the deck has very strong capabilities. In times of adversity - people tend to triumph the most. I think Miragestallio getting banned was important for the deck - but it can manage quite well without it. This is by far the meta deck got hurt the least - and you can tell due to its incredible boards! Like a phoenix, we must rise from the ashes - or in this case like a fox. Or a falcon. Or even a jaguar. And maybe an armadillo as well. And..you get the point. Our spicy, furry friends are not going anywhere just yet - Konami will have to simply try harder...."
