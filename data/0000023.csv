With Double Iris and Astrograph Sorcerer banned in the last lists, i've been testing a build that can handle a great variety of situations using some of my favorite Extra Deck monsters. This deck uses all Extra Deck summon methods, and reasonably knowing what your opponent's deck does, you choose the appropriate monsters to bring. Here are some examples:</p> <p><strong><em>OFFENSIVE MOVES:</em></strong></p> <p><strong>*Opponent's monster cannot be destroyed by battle</strong>; -&gt; Use <em>Borreload Dragon </em>to steal it or just summon <em>Supreme King Servant Dark Rebellion </em>to cause a lot of damage if the opponent's monster have a great attack. <em>Timebreaker Magician </em>can also banish both itself and your opponent's monster.</p> <p><strong>*Opponent's monster cannot be targeted by your card effects</strong>; -&gt; <em>Borreload Dragon </em>and <em>SKS Dark Rebellion </em>can handle this situation. You can also use <em>SKS Clear Wing </em>to destroy all your opponent's monsters and OTK using all your monsters. <em>SKS Clear Wing </em>also can destroy a monster that battles with him before the damage step and cause effect damage equal the ATK of the destroyed monster.</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's monster cannot be destroyed by your card effects</strong>; -&gt; Again, <em>Borreload </em>and <em>Dark Rebellion </em>helps a lot when you are trying to OTK.</p> <p><em><strong>STUNNING/CONTROL MOVES:</strong></em></p> <p>*<strong>Opponent is using a deck with a great number of LV5 or higher monster effects; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon </em>and <em>Odd-eyes Vortex Dragon </em>to interrupt your opponent's monsters effects. <em>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon </em>is really helpful against <em>Timelords </em>and <em>Blue-eyes,</em> for example. <em>Jackal </em>can also help negating too, but it'll need 2 spell counters (it works for any deck, not specifficaly LV5).</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's deck uses too much special summons to build its board; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Evilswarm Nightmare </em>to stun 2 of your opponent's special summons. Be sure to stun at the weak point of your opponent's combo. You can also use <em>Number 41: Bagooska </em>to stun the game for 3 turns, but be careful with Link monsters, since they can't be changed to defense position.</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's deck uses spells/traps to significantly build its board; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Vortex </em>and <em>Norito </em>to negate your opponent's spells/traps.</p> <p>*<strong>Opponent's deck uses card destruction to clear your field and attack you directly with medium/low attack monsters; </strong>-&gt; Use <em>Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons </em>to hold your field, since it cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects (but can be targeted).</p> <p><em><strong>SUPPORT/FIELD BUILD MOVES:</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>Electrumite:</strong> Summon him (2 or 3 times, if possible) to prepare your Pendulum Summon. Be sure to bring 2 level 7 monsters to summon Absolute Dragon.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Odd-eyes Absolute Dragon:</strong> Absolute is the gate to bring Vortex. Use it as a link material to summon Borreload to just bring Vortex after that.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Odd-eyes Meteorburst Dragon: </strong></em><em>Meteorburst is here to summon a monster from your Pendulum Zone and use itself to bring Absolute. It can also stun effects during the battle phase.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Metaltron: </strong></em><em>Metaltron is summoned using 2 Electrumites. Use it to open more zones for the Pendulum Summon and optimize your play bringing more Extra Deck monsters to help you.</em></p>"

Or if you have two Trickstar Reincarnations you can use the first one during your opponent's first standby phase then after the first one resolves use the second one and chain it with Droll &amp; Lock Bird, that way they lose their entire hand and cannot play. Or you can go second and use cards like <a data-name=""Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!"">Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!</a> to kill off your opponents monsters. Trickstars fix the whole Sky Striker engine as a whole because you have six extra spell cards at your disposal which are the three <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>s and the three <a data-name=""Trickstar Light Stage"">Trickstar Light Stage</a>s. This way you get spells into your grave faster which will allows you to activate the second effect of all the Sky Striker spell cards. <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> is also super powerful in this deck because it means you get to summon <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> which then means you can loop <a data-name=""Trickstar Lilybell"">Trickstar Lilybell</a> and <a data-name=""Trickstar Lycoris"">Trickstar Lycoris</a> to continuously summon Lilybell off Firewall's special summon effect. Scapegoat is just really powerful in general though since you can go into the Knightmare link monsters and all. Enjoy the deck!"

Its pretty straight forward, however it leaves alot of options depending on the opening hand. I dont use a hero lives, its not worth the cost to me. I often use mask change with absolute zero with masked hero acid to clear my opponents side of the field. Forbidden lance is very useful and underrated in my opinion. I always keep at least two copies of twin twisters and discard shadow mist to use its effect and add a bubbleman to my hand.  I never use traditional recipes. I built this deck to be different from everybody else and It has been good in my duels.  &nbsp;  let me know what you think!!!"

A standard combo would only require a Rainbow Dragon and Vision HERO Vyon in hand:  1. Normal Summon Vision HERO Vyon 2. Send Elemental HERO Shadow Mist to the grave through Vyon's effect 3. Use Shadow Mist's effect to search for Elemental HERO Neos to add to your hand 4. Activate Vyon's effect to banish Elemental HERO Shadow Mist to add a Polymerization to your hand 5. Use Polymerization to fuse Rainbow Dragon and Elemental HERO Neos into Rainbow Neos 6. Winner winner, chicken dinner  If you can't get to Vyon but have Shadow Mist or Prisma in hand as well as a Mask Change, Masked HERO Koga and Dark Law are good alternatives till you can get to the necessary play makers. Nova Master, The Shining, and Escuardo are also good if you happen to have a Polymerization in hand with Blazeman or Rainbow Dragon in hand. Good luck and have fun!  --  In the advent of the newest banlist, I have made some slight tweaks to the deck to try and boost consistency. If you have any suggestions on improving the deck, please feel free to comment to make my favorite deck the best it can be! Thank you and enjoy!  --  My (possible) final update for my favorite deck to play. With the new Neos support and the access of Super Polymerization as well as Neos Fusion being a one card Rainbow Neos, I feel as though the deck has reached it's final stage. If you have any suggestions on improving the deck, please don't hesitate to let me know!  Enjoy duelists!  --  I was a big silly for thinking I was done lol So I <em>tried</em> to make it so you have a much more variety of plays you could make besides Isolde, Fusion Monster, Pass. Added some more generic links and cut some dead cards like Prisma and Mask Change and the like. I dunno if this is better, I haven't tested it out yet (what a genius I am) but I cut the cards I knew that needed to go. Hope this can be the definitive version of the deck, I love Rainbow Neos so I want to see him do his best. As always, please leave suggestions that could help make this deck the best it can be! Enjoy!  --  I don't know anymore. The new Predaplant Link monster means you are now playing like 7 copies of Neos Fusion. That's crazy. Enjoy!  &nbsp;"

""Mound of the Bound Creator"", and  c.) a combination of co-linked ""Knightmare"" monsters, ""Borrel-"" monsters, and ""Firewall Dragon"".  The absolute best hand you can start with, going first, will contain either ""Terraforming"" or ""Mound of the Bound Creator"", an ""Earthbound Immortal"" monster, and ""Scapeghost"". The best Immortals' effects require you to tribute a monster (e.g. Uru's ""Change of Heart"" effect.), so ""Scapeghost"" provides, at most, 3 uses of these effects, as well as fodder to Tribute Summon an Immortal. Alternatively, you can make ""Summon Sorceress"" and a ""Knightmare"" monster, then use the effect of ""Summon Sorceress"" to Special Summon ""Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu"" from your deck. This deck does best going first. If done right, you can often OTK using the effect of ""Borrelsword Dragon"" and the Direct Attacking abilities of your ""Earthbound Immortal"" monsters, as well as the burn effect of ""Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu"". This is the second edit of the deck, which is still in-dev by myself and a few friends."

You go first, you win. Goukis make crazy boards going first that make your opponent lose instantly because they cannot target, destroy by battle, or destroy by card effects your monsters. The combos to this deck are stupidly good but really hard to master. I will explain how to extra link your opponent... The first step is to make <a data-name=""Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights"">Isolde, Two Tales of The Noble Knights</a>, then use her second effect to send <a data-name=""Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade"">Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade</a> and special summon <a data-name=""Gouki Octostretch"">Gouki Octostretch</a>. Then, from the first effect of Isolde you should have added either <a data-name=""Gouki Bearhug"">Gouki Bearhug</a> or <a data-name=""Gouki Riscorpio"">Gouki Riscorpio</a> and <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">Gouki Headbatt</a> from the Gouki you sent to the graveyard as material for Isolde. Keep in mind you can use <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">M-X-Saber Invoker</a> too to summon Isolde. Then special summon Headbatt by sending Bearhug or Riscorpio and make <a data-name=""Knightmare Goblin"">Knightmare Goblin</a> but do not use Goblin's effect. Search off the <a data-name=""Gouki Octostretch"">Gouki Octostretch</a> that was used to make Goblin to get <a data-name=""Gouki Rematch"">Gouki Rematch</a>. Use Rematch to special summon two Goukis in your grave. <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">Foolish Burial</a> can help if you have it in your hand before you use Rematch that way you can send a Gouki that you haven't used its search effect yet. After that, use Isolde and the two Goukis on the field from Rematch to make <a data-name=""Firewall Dragon"">Firewall Dragon</a> to the right of Goblin. Use the effect of Divine Sword in your grave to banish two warrior monsters, preferably not the Goukis and add the Divine Sword to your hand. Then make <a data-name=""Knightmare Mermaid"">Knightmare Mermaid</a> using Goblin and put it up on top of Firewall so that they are co-linked and activate Firewall and Mermaids effects, Mermaid as chain link one, Firewall as chain link two. Send Divine Sword as cost for Mermaid and special summon the monster from your hand from Firewall's effect right next to it on the left or right side and then <a data-name=""Knightmare Corruptor Iblee"">Knightmare Corruptor Iblee</a> on the other side of Firewall and draw one card from Mermaid being co-linked. Keep in mind when you are special summoning monsters from your hand off Firewalls effect they need to be Goukis that way you can keep searching Goukis and keep special summoning off Firewalls effect. Next, use Divine Sword again to add it again. Then, use Iblee and the monster from Firewall's effect to link summon the second Goblin to the left of Firewall where the previous Goblin was. Go ahead and use both Firewall and Goblin's effects, doesn't matter what order, and pitch the Divine Sword again. But do not use Iblee's effect in grave! You need Iblee at this point. Special summon another Gouki from your hand to the right of Firewall. Make sure to draw one card since Goblin is co-linked. Then use Firewalls effect to add Octostretch and Iblee from grave back to your hand. Try to keep the Octostretch in your hand as long as possible because you need it for <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> later. Perform your second normal summon with Iblee right next to Goblin and special summon the other Goblin in your grave off Iblee's effect to the left of Iblee. Proceed to link summon <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> using Iblee and the monster to the right of Firewall where the monster to the right of Firewall was. Use Iblee's effect this time to special summon Iblee to your opponent's field. And of course, Firewall's effect triggers *sigh*, special summon another monster from your hand where Iblee was, to the left of Goblin. Then use that monster and Underclock to make <a data-name=""&lt;a data-name="">Trigate Wizard</a> in between the two Goblins. Of course, Firewall goes off again... Special summon again to the right of Firewall. Use that monster and the Goblin that has its effects negated that was summoned off Iblee to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> to the left of Trigate Wizard. Then use Firewall's effect to special summon but this time, special summon a level one whither its <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> or Octostretch if you were able to keep it in your hand, etc. Go into Linkuriboh on top of Trigate Wizard to extra link your opponent. Finally, that triggers Firewall's effect once more allowing you to use Firewall and the monster you special summoned off Firewall as material to link into <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> to the right of Goblin where Firewall originally was. That's how you extra link your opponent! You can also make <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> going first using <a data-name=""Glow-Up Bulb"">Glow-Up Bulb</a> and <a data-name=""Spyral Super Agent"">Spyral Super Agent</a> or <a data-name=""Gouki Suprex"">Gouki Suprex</a>.

This deck has been built by me of course from scratch and has been tested. It does very well against meta decks and tier two decks. The goal is to go second and otk your opponent using cards like Black Luster Soldier and Dante. There isn't very much to say about this deck other then it's just good. There is a cool otk combo going second where you summon <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> and then summon Black Luster Soldier under Underclock Taker and then use Underclock's effect to reduce your opponents monster's attack to zero and then inflict seven thousand damage or more if you have Dante on board or another monster!"

Its a level 3 monster that gains 400 attack per banished card and (you guessed it) this deck revolves around banishing. I've won games with Gren Maju having over 16,000 attack before. Soul Absorption is an amazing choice - 500 free LP every time a card's banished. I've also won games with over 40,000 LP before. Needless to say this deck is filthy, I came second in a tournament recently with it and only lost because of deck-out, so this is good if you want to win.

Focusing on special summoning and hea,"There are a couple of strats in this deck. One of which is getting an Extra Deck dragon onto the field, usually by special summoning materials from the graveyard using cards like Call of the Haunted, Silver's Cry or Soul Charge. This strategy is all about control of the field, with cards like BE Twin Burst Dragon, FHD and Odd Eyes Absolute Dragon. Some of these summoning methods even have ways of summoning multiple ED dragons at once. Take Azure Eyes Silver Dragon, when summoned, you're guaranteed to get a Blue-Eyes White Dragon at the start of your next turn. This can be used to help get Twin Burst Dragon onto the field.  Alternate strategies involve using the two Egyptian Gods, Slifer the Sky Dragon and Obelisk the Tormentor, Slifer isn't a priority in this deck but can come in handy when you've got a big hand and maybe a Soul Charge lying around. The best way to get one of these onto the field is to either special summon from the graveyard, or (If you're lucky), your opponent not destroying your front line.  A simple overview of the deck is that you want your best cards in the graveyard to special summon later. But if you're worried about banishment, don't fret. Imperial Iron Wall will help protect against that. As much as this deck seems to be about pressuring your opponent and dealing a lot of damage, it does have some elements of denial. Whether it's Compulsory Evacuation Device, Enemy Controller or Raigeki, you're sure to foil your opponent's strategy."
