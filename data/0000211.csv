They also captur,"Fluffal and Edge Imp monsters are used to fusion summon Frightfur fusion-monsters. Both Fluffal and Edhe Imps have effects which allow them to summon others, send them to the GY or add them to the hand. Frightfurs themself have rather low attack power but most of them have effects which improve the strenght of themself or other Frightfurs. So most main deck cards make it possible to add a lot of material for fusion summoning while the fusionmonsters themself make the most damage."

You have access to a few key specific floodgates, as well as powerful tools that help break boards and set up interrup","Sword Soul deck. The draw of the deck is the powerful Synchros it can make, in particularly Cheng Ying's ability to be 2ish interruptions provided you can proc him. So why Tenyis? A few reasons. Firstly, I'm partial to more tribal decks, and having a general Wyrm engine appeals to me. Secondly, I suspect it increases consistency, and it certainly increases explosiveness, playing more like the combo decks I am used to. Lastly, running this package enablers me to play more floodgates in the Extra Deck. Lastly, being far less Normal Summon reliant means the deck plays Sphere Mode quite well. This version of the deck is very good at cracking boards, even just using engine cards and the maindeck staples. The side deck particularly emphasizes this - we'd prefer to go first, but if you make us go second you might actually have a worse time in some circumstances. Let's go over the list.  Long Yuan is one of the most important Sword Souls monsters, since it by itself makes Baroness De Fleur or more importantly Cheng Ying. It also doesn't conflict with Sphere Mode. Mo Ye is powerful, getting to draw a card is great and our main extender out of the Extra Deck is a Synchro 8 that counts as an interruption, very beautiful. I think you have to run 3 of both of these. Tai A is less important, but you want to play 2 so that you're less likely to banish it with Desires, since it is a common search off of the Rota, and leads to Synchro 8 Spam. While these are normal summons, neither have to be normal summoned, and you will start your plays sometimes by resurrecting them with the Monster Reborn of the archetype, or the Shaman of the Tenyi, and yes, this is actually a lot more realistic than you might think. We play a lot of Tenyi monsters and any 2 of them into Shaman is totally believable, and in fact you'll often get some other value off of Tenyi plays in the process. The Rota is obligatory, it's the Rota, the field spell is this one card you can search to spam out 8s and is just good enough as an engine card to run 1 of it IMO. I'd consider cutting it, but the Synchro 8 Spam is a neat option that merits use in some matchups anyways, because of Dragite, and because of having a larger full combo.  For Tenyi monsters, we run 2 of the most important Tenyi monsters, Vishuda. You could honestly bump this up to 3 and be happy, it is the most valuable of the Tenyi cards. Like Alpha, this can bounce a monster, including bouncing a Kaiju back into your own hand. You can break some pretty mighty boards with this deck, because including this card you're running as many as 13 board breaking cards vs hefy boards, meaning when you know (or smell) that you're going second you come in with a great chance to actually bust some boards before making Wyrm plays. It's also an engine card. Adhara gives you access to Level 9 Synchro plays and refills your hand for Long Yuan, helping you say search it or the trap, for making those Level 9s is particularly noteworthy. Ashuna + any other Tenyi is full combo. Okay, not quite, but it's a good enough starter to combos that you want to see Ashuna. And Vessel just increases your chances of seeing the right Tenyi's, the card is either dead or a must negate generally speaking. I think it's worth it to run, because you have so many Tenyi cards, and this makes your big Tenyi combo plays way more common.  1 Gold Sarc. Hate the card, but we're on 3 Adhara, and it has other utility. In fact this and Called By The Grave are both run in this list primarily to proc Cheng Ying, hilariously enough, but obviously Called might make the cut anyways.  3 Pot of Desires. Banishes barely matter to this deck, you'll sometimes gimp yourself but more often than not it is free consistency, and you can afford to run the numbers to almost never feel this. I still struggle a little bit to understand why Pot feels better here than in some other homes, but it does, though that perception could simply be my own luck changing. The more I test the more I see, in this archetype you want the cards more than to see 1 specific engine card, so Prosperity is probably worse.  Forbidden Droplet is live often enough going first, and necessary often enough going second, and actually makes the cut on the merit of making us lose going second significantly less. Tenyi monsters actually like being in the GY sometimes, so even if you pitch 3 cards a lot of the time you'll still have solid plays to make after that to break boards. Tactics, in turn, is better going first, being either a consistency card or a way to make hand traps worse. It makes the main deck because going second against Dragoon, it is just GG for the Dragoon player, and Dragoon will be important to handle until it is banned. Solemn Strike is an amazing going first card that stays in whenever we are going first. However, like the rest of this package is is good going second as well, an actual hard negate at Spell Speed 3 that also negates summons is very good.  So, for the extra deck. 2 Chi Xiao, because this is like the archetype's Needlefibre, and it is also on of your main bosses and your main way to trigger Cheng Ying at the right time. You need 2 for your grind game. 1 Cheng Ying, you must also run this, this card is the reason to play the deck. A little bit tricky to activate its effect and time it for the right disruption, but very powerful on the face of it. 1 Draco Bersker. You're often locked into Wyrm monsters because of Ashuna, and this gives you the very important second rank 8 to make in those situations, and as a bonus it it good going first or second and trigger's Cheng Ying. 1 Yazi. You can make this with level manipulation, but you also make this with Long Yuan and a Adhara. It pops a card before summoning out Tai A and is fuel for Tai A, and is good going second, but I rarely actually make it. You need a level 7 for some boards (to not waste resources) and this is the only Wyrm, but it is pretty good in the deck. 2 Baxia - shuffling cards into the deck is good going second, even if it does target. You make this into Chaofeng in some of your combos. giving you an amazing Floodgate against Light attribute based decks. With the help of level modulation, you can occasionally make Yazi into Chaofeng locking decks out of Dark monsters, similarly if not more broken. Dragite is a generic backrow negate, but you turn him on with Mo Ye naturally and it contributes to the ability to actually put up real negates. Baroness De Fleur is a way to break boards that is also one omni-negate and a monster Reborn. I don't know if this will be legal at the same time as Sword Soul, at least right away, but for now I'm being an optimist and hoping we get it. I'm on 1 Shenshen. Not only is this a reasonably floodgate against a lot of decks, but you make it easily throughout your combos, and you make it off of Chi Xiao and then revive it in some Tenyi combos, so it isn't going without support. It seems good to have as an option. Lastly we run 1 Omega, because we need generic and powerful Synchro 8s and yeah, Omega still makes the cut. I find myself never making this, but it is strictly better than any of the alternatives. Lastly we have some Tenyi monsters, these make the Tenyi engine go Brr, and Shaman makes Sphere Mode kind of a breeze.  So the side deck. The deck seems powerful enough at putting up interruptions and pressure going first that I wanted to lean on a side deck built around breaking boards. The idea is that if we can pretty consistently break even the beefiest of boards we can decide to go second, maybe shake up somebody's siding plan, but also I don't think the deck needs a lot more going first. You're usually siding out some number of the pots, as well as TTT (which stays in over Sphere Mode in matchups that swing down to Dragoon). So here are the numbers. 3 Sphere Mode. Yes this eats up your normal summons, but this isn't as relevant as you might think. It also immediately solves a lot of problem boards, and again helps enable us to eat even really beefy boards. Because it can't be targeted you can't return this to your hand with Vishuda, but you can with Alpha, meaning this + Alpha if they have a 6 monster board, but in practice if they do they have an interruption to prevent this anyways, so it isn't as relevant as it is with the Kaijus. Speaking of 2 Gadarla, 2 Alpha. Gadarla tributes over Wind Barrier Statue and is level 8, and you can bounce it with Alpha or Vishuda to get an extra tribute. Did I mention this deck was good at breaking boards? Alpha is Alpha, it is the new Pankratops, and is just as broken. 1 Pankratops because even though it doesn't play into the loops, it doubles as spell and trap removal, making it still slightly more valuable than Alpha despite lacking the synergy. Also the more different names we run the more of these effects, again you're bringing in whichever 13 board breakers are most relevant including many different names and effects that synergize. You also aren't obligated to bring them in. If Sphere Mode is bad, leave in Tactics, it is as simple as that. I wanted some ways to handle backrow beside Pankratops, so I went with Twintwister. I just noticed that a lot of the decks you would bring it in against getting the banish isn't as relevant as getting that second set card. Then Red Reboot, because it is Red Reboot. Goodbye trap deck. For my last option I had space to play going first cards, and I tested a lot of Solemn Judgement. But in thinking about the meta, both now and in the future, I'm expecting the top decks in the current meta will stay powerful, and that this deck and Flundereeze become contenders, and I'm seeing a lot of overlap in the decks that are weak to this card. Against Flundereeze it stops tributing, against Drytron it stops ritual summoning, against Rokkets it stops seal, it stops Romulus, it stops Darkness Metal, it basically neuters a lot of plays. Sure in the mirror and against Prank Kids it does nothing, but in Tribrigade it shuts down their whole mechanic, against any Isolde abuse no Isolde. So you've got like Phantom Knights, the Mirror, Prank Kids, and Sky Striker, and a myriad of decks this doesn't hit that hard, but it does hit a whole swath of them a lot harder than it hits you, especially going first. Now game 3 they have to side in that backrow removal and you might've already pulled em out if you're going second. It basically lets me hit a swath of decks, including some of the threats I expect to still be relevant and some newcomers, so for theorycrafting it seems like a good place to start, since it just hits all the best decks but the mirror, with a couple notable exceptions, and there wasn't space to have 3 specific hand traps to bring in for every random combo matchup. Against a lot of those decks Sphere Mode is fine, Desires is fine, or Tactics is fine, and will generally be higher impact than any hand trap."

For the extra support I went with direct <strong>Dark Magician</strong> support, using two of his new support cards and two already exisiting ones:  <strong>***Timaeus the Dragon of Destiny</strong> can easily be summoned since a ot of the normal monsters are Spellcasters and the Extra Deck is packed with generic Fusion Monsters for <strong>Dark Magician</strong> and some of the Normal Monsters. Your usually main goal is to summon <strong>Dark Magician the Dragon Knight</strong> to protect <strong>Eternal Soul</strong>.  <strong>**Magician's Salvation</strong> is their new Field Spell, setting a <strong>Eternal Soul</strong> directly from the Deck upon activation. It has a second effect regarding <strong>Dark Magician</strong> and <strong>Dark Magician Girl</strong>, but is mainly used for the first effect here.  <strong>**Magicians' Souls</strong> and <strong>***Eternal Soul</strong> are added to turbo out Dark Magician more faster on the field."

After being late for days due to college, I finally bring to you the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong> for the <strong>Shaddoll Showdown Structure Deck</strong>!</p> <p>Rules are still the same: A 40-card deck made using at least 30+ cards from the Structure Deck. The Extra Deck is free to edit.</p> <p><strong><span>Archetype Breakdown</span></strong></p> <p><strong>Shaddolls</strong> are, at least before this Structure Deck release, an archetype filled with DARK Spellcaster-Type Flip Monsters, having the peculiarity that they also have an additional effect if they are sent to the GY by a card effect; with the only downside that you must choose which effect to use for that card for the rest of the turn. While some of them, including the new support, has some great Flip effects, you most of the time will be using the GY effects due to their easiness to mill within this archetype, and those effects are also good. Their Extra Deck, which is mostly famous and infamous, consists of monsters that cover all Attributes in the game, except DIVINE. All share the same summoning condition of requiring a Shaddoll monster and 1 monster that shares the same attribute as the Fusion monster. This aspect has made Shaddolls since is dayview as very splashable archetype that would saw a lot of variants that would exploit their GY setups; with <strong>Lightsworns</strong>, <strong>Invoked</strong> and even <strong>Dinosaurs</strong> as examples.</p> <p>The new support coming from the Structure Deck alongside some new outside support granted it Shaddoll monsters of different Attributes in the Main Deck, making the idea of a pure-ish Shaddoll Deck possible while still being able to have access to their Attribute-specific Fusion monsters. Speaking of which, they also got a new generic Fusion monster giving that they now have more monsters with different Attributes in the Main Deck, and some backrow support for both the Fusion and Flip playstyle.</p> <p>The analysis of the Deck will start with the Shaddoll cards, including the outside support. And then I'll talk about the other cards used in. Due to the nature of the Shaddoll monsters, I'll breakdown their effects in this way: For Main Deck monsters I'll separate the Flip effect and GY effect, while with the Fusion monsters I'll list their effect on Summon (if any), their effect on the field and their GY effect. With that said, let's begin.</p> <p><span><strong>Shaddoll monsters from the Main Deck</strong></span> <strong>*Helshaddoll Hollow:</strong> This big boi is the FIRE Attribute monster (they only got one for each Attribute other than DARK, so I have to work with it) of the Archetype and is also the biggest monster from the Main Deck in terms of stat line, being a Level 9 FIRE Fiend with 2900 ATK/DEF. Flip Effect: Target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster with the same Attribute from the Extra Deck to the GY, and if you do, banish the targeted monster. If you haven't played or know about <strong>Shaddolls</strong> you might think this effect's cost is too much, but keep in mind that all Shaddoll Fusion monsters have a GY effect, can be used as material for Fusions with certain cards and the most popular Attributes in the game, those being EARTH, LIGHT and DARK, can be covered with <strong>Shekhinaga</strong>, <strong>Construct</strong>, <strong>Winda</strong> or their new Fusion monster. GY Effect: You can send cards from the top of your Deck to the GY equal to the number of different and original Attributes among the monsters on the field. If used normally it can lead to a 2-3 card mill, which it could be good if you're lucky. Even more, some of the new support gives the Deck more interacions with the GY so its good. Only run 1 though, it can be bricky due to his high Level.</p> <p><strong>*Shaddoll Beast</strong>: Flip effect: You can draw 2 cards, then discard 1. GY effect: You can draw 1 card. The only annoying thing about <strong>Beast</strong> is the fact that it is Level 5, other than that, he's pluses in any way you used him. Some new cards can recycle him a lot, and his Level can make him bricky, so running 1 is fine. 2 if you seriously need more draw power.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Dragon</strong>: Flip effect: You can target 1 card your opponent controls; return it to the hand. GY effect: You can target 1 Spell/Trap on the field and destroy it. You might have seen this one in <strong>Lightsworn</strong> builds, whether they actually played Shaddolls or not, due to his backrow popping effect. While his bounce effect is also good but rarely used, he's still pretty good to use.</p> <p><strong>*Shaddoll Squamata</strong>: Flip effect: You can target 1 monster on the field and destroy it. GY effect: You can send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the Deck to the GY, except another copy of itself. His Flip effect can catch someone by suprise and his GY effect can be used on any Shaddoll card, including the backrow (you'll later understand why). You could also run 2, but this build is quite tight already.</p> <p><strong>*Naelshaddoll Ariel</strong>: This is the WATER representative, with a heavy emphasis on banished cards. Flip effect: You can target 1 of your banished ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monsters and Special Summon it in face-down or face-up Defense Position. GY effect: You can target up to 3 cards in either GYs and banish them. She, alognside two more monsters that came in this Structure Deck, gives <strong>Shaddoll</strong> a way to swarm the field and placing them face-down if you want to use their Flip effects.</p> <p><strong>***Reeshaddoll Wendi</strong>: She is the WIND representative, focusing with the Deck. One of the reasons she's played at 3. Flip effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the Deck in face-up or face-down Defense Position, except another copy of herself. GY effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the Deck in face-down Defense Position, except another copy of herself. Now, choose: You want to Special Summon from the Deck or Special Summon from the Deck? I think you might want to Special Summon from the Deck.</p> <p><strong>***Shaddoll Hedgehog</strong>: Another <strong>Shaddoll</strong> monster that is quite famous for how good of a searcher he is for his archetype. Flip effect: You can add 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Spell/Trap from the Deck to the hand. GY effect: You can add 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the Deck to the hand, except another copy of itself. Run it at 3 as well, he's a really good searcher.</p> <p><strong>**Qadshaddoll Keios</strong>: The 3rd monster on the Special Summon Triad of new support, focusing on the hand; while also being the LIGHT representative. Flip effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the hand in face-up or face-down Defense Position. GY effect: You can send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster from the hand to the GY, if you do, until the rest of the turn all monsters you control gain 100 ATK/DEF times the original Level of the sent monster. He can help if your starting hand is filled with Shaddoll monsters you want to use their Flip effects, while being LIGHT Attribute gives him access to <strong>Construct</strong>. The attack boost can also be helpful if you need an extra push in the damage aspect.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Falco</strong>: Flip effect: You can target 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster in your GY except another copy of itself and Special Summon it in face-down Defense Position. GY effect: You can Special Summon this card in face-down Defense Position. He has some good interactions with the GY and with <strong>Ariel</strong>, <strong>Wendi</strong> and <strong>Keios</strong> they can give the Deck a lot of swarming potential. Also, he can be used as a Fusion material in your turn, bring himself back with his effect and then use the Flip effect later.</p> <span><strong>Backrow</strong></span> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Fusion, **El Shaddoll Fusion, *Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</strong>: This 3 cards are Fusion Spells for the <strong>Shaddoll</strong> archetype. <strong>Shaddoll Fusion</strong> allows the Fusion of a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster using monsters from the hand or field as materials. However, if your opponent has a monster Special Summoned from the Extra Deck, you can use monsters from the Deck as well. <strong>El Shaddoll Fusion</strong> can also Fusion Summon a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster using materials from the hand or field as material; with the added fact that it is a Quick-Play Spell. The last one, <strong>Nephe Shaddoll Fusion</strong> is an Equip Spell that can only be used on a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster and by declaring 1 Atrribute. The equipped monster is treated as having that Attribute and it can Fusion Summon 1 ""Shaddoll"" Fusion monster using materials from the hand or field, including the equipped monster. All of them should be played but the issue has always being the ratios. Some will favor playing more copies of El Shaddoll Fusion than Shaddoll Fusion and vice-versa; while Nephe fell a bit since now Shaddoll has monsters with different Attributes. I decided to play 2-2-1, since each one of them have their uses and <strong>Nephe</strong> can help out if you didn't open with the needed Attributes.</p> <p><strong>***Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</strong>: This is their new Trap Card, which has 2 effects. The first one targets 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster in your GY and Special Summon it in face-up or face-down Defense Position. The other effect can be activated from the GY: you can banish it alongside 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the GY to either change 1 face-down monster you control to face-up Defense Position or change 1 face-up monster you control to face-down Defense Position. Is a realy good revival card, can make the Flip effects easier to access if the monster you want to activate happens to be set that same turn or to activate the effect of the monster you just revived.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Core</strong>: This is a Continuous Trap that can Special Summon itself as a Level 9 DARK Spellcaster with 1450 ATK/1950 DEF. If it was Summoned this way, it can be treated as any Attribute for the Fusion Summon of a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster. Also, if this card is sent to the GY by a card effect you can target 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Spell/Trap in your GY except itself and add it to your hand. Before the new monsters, this was the main access to other Attributes if you played a pure build, while his recycling effect is helpful to bring back the Fusion Spells. Keep in mind that it can recycle cards even when used as a Fusion material.</p> <p><strong>**Shaddoll Schism</strong>: This is new outside support, being a Continuous Trap. During the Main Phase only, you can Fusion Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster by banishing its materials from the field or GY, and then you can send to the GY 1 monster your opponent controls that shares the Attribute of the Summoned monster, this is without targeting. However, the Summoned monster cannot attack directly. This Trap Card grants you a way to still use your <strong>Shaddoll</strong> monsters from the GY besides <strong>Falco</strong> and <strong>Incarnation</strong>, and even<strong> Ariel</strong> can bring back one of them if you need so. Is pretty good, but since requires setup to use, I don't recommend maxing it. 2 has worked fine with me.</p> <strong><span>Shaddoll monsters in the Extra Deck</span></strong> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</strong>: Finally starting with the Extra Deck, we'll start with the EARTH Fusion. Is a Level 10 EARTH Machine with 2600 ATK/3000 DEF that requires a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monster + 1 EARTH monster. On the field: When a Special Summoned monster activates their effect but you have a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card in the hand, as a Quick Effect, you can negate the activation, destroy that monster and then send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the hand to the GY. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Spell/Trap in your GY and add it to the hand. As a note, all except the new Fusion monster share the last effect. For its summon, I used <strong>Mathematician</strong> due to how helpful he is for mill decks while also being an EARTH monster, and if you ask: yes, they also have a new EARTH representative called <strong>Nehshaddoll Genius</strong>, but the decklist was a bit to tight to add it. Run 1 of it if you like so. Shekhinaga is one of your largest walls and can net some effect negation. Run either 1 or 2.</p> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Construct</strong>: The main boss monster of the Deck, while also being the most splashable of them alongside Winda since it is the LIGHT Fusion monster, needing 1 Shaddoll monster + 1 LIGHT monster. On Summon: You can send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the Deck to the GY. On the field: At the start of the Damage Step, if this card battles an Special Summoned monster: Destroy that monster. Also has the recycle effect. This monster has seen its time on the Limited list just for how good it is in general. There are, even to this day, many LIGHT monsters that could benefit from being used as a material giving that <strong>Shaddoll Fusion</strong> can use materials from the Deck if the conditions are met. It also makes her, and pretty much every Attribute-exclusive Fusion monster to be a good target for <strong>Super Polymerization</strong> plays.</p> <p><strong>*El Shaddoll Grysta</strong>: This one is the FIRE Fusion monster, which has an effect kind of similar to <strong>Shekhinaga</strong>. It requires 1 Shaddoll monster + 1 FIRE monster. On the field: When your opponent would Special Summon a monster but you have a ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card in the hand, as a Quick Effect, you can negate the Summon, destroy that monster and then send 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the hand to the GY. It also has the recycle effect. This one is a bit less played, since their are some conditions in which you can and cannot activate his negation due to rulings. That doesn't mean it isn't good to have it around if needed.</p> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Apkallone</strong>: This is their new Fusion monster, which requires any 2 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monsters with different Attributes. On Summon: If this card is Special Summoned (not just by Fusion): You can target 1 face-up card on the field and negate its effects while it remains there. On the field: Cannot be destroyed by battle. If it is sent to the GY: You can add 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" card from the Deck or GY to the hand, then discard 1 card. Its on Summon effect can be used many times since its not limited to only Fusion, providing the lockdown of 1 face-up card on the field; which is great against floodgates or continuous effects. Its GY effect differs from the rest, since it works with any card. The discard downside can be used in your favor to trigger the effect of the ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" monsters.</p> <p><strong>**El Shaddoll Winda</strong>: Lastly, we have the DARK representative requiring 1 Shaddoll monster + 1 DARK monster. She alongside <strong>Construct</strong> and <strong>Apkallone</strong> are their most accesible Fusion monsters while also being very splashable in <strong>Winda</strong> and <strong>Construct's</strong> case. On the field: Both players can only Special Summon monsters once per turn. It also has the recycling effect. Due to her low level (being 5), it can be Summoned with Instant Fusion. That being said, is one of the most hated floodgates due to how easy is to summon and how much it can slow the pace of a duel.</p> <p><strong>*Shaddoll Construct</strong>: Their only Link monster, being a Link-2 monster with 1200 ATK pointing Left and Right. During the Main Phase, you can Fusion Summon 1 ""<strong>Shaddoll</strong>"" Fusion monster using monsters from the hand or field as materials. If this card is in the GY, you can send 1 ""Shaddoll"" card from the hand or face-up in the field to the GY to Special Summon this card. It can also work as a constant Fusion enabler, giving that it can use itself as material, recycle itself and being a LIGHT monster gives it access to <strong>Construct</strong> or <strong>Apkallone</strong>. Run 1 if you like. The Extra Deck is pretty tight though.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about the non-Shaddoll cards: <strong>*Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</strong>: I think this card doesn't require introduction since how much of a powerhouse he still is today, after all these years. Since this deck runs a fair share of LIGHT monsters, any Chaos monster with reliable effects can be pretty much added here. BLS is pretty much the best option, but if you need more than just on-target banishing or double attacking; <strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer</strong>, <strong>The Chaos Creator</strong> and <strong>Chaos Grepher</strong> are also pretty solid.</p> <p><strong>*Timaeus the Dragon of Destiny</strong>: This one is the odd pick, coming way into the future with the new Dark Magician support from the Battle of Chaos set that was announced recently. Is a Level 8 LIGHT Dragon that can be Special Summoned from the hand by sending 1 Spellcaster monster OR 1 Spell/Trap that lists ""<strong>Dark Magician</strong>"" in its text from the hand or field to the GY. While it might look confusing at first, the Spellcaster monster doesn't need to list ""<strong>Dark Magician</strong>"", and most of the Shaddoll monsters are Spellcasters; so it can become a large body while also triggering the sent Shaddoll monster. On the field, it can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster using materials from the hand or field as materials, including at least 1 Spellcaster monster. It can grant you more Fusion Summons while its LIGHT Attribute can help to bring <strong>Construct</strong> faster. I only put 1 for test purposes, and I can safely say its pretty good and running 2 might not be a bad idea.</p> <p><strong>*Electromagnetic Turtle</strong>: Its a Level 4 LIGHT Machine that during your opponent's Battle Phase can banish itself to end it. This effect is a once per Duel effect, but is often milled or used for a Fusion Summon due to its Attribute and good defensive effect.</p> <p><strong>***Mathematician</strong>: Is a Level 3 EARTH Spellcaster monster that when it is Normal Summoned you can send 1 Level 4 or lower monster from the Deck to the GY. When this monster is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: you can draw 1 card. Its mill effect is its most used effect, helping you trigger the <strong>Shaddoll</strong>'s GY effects. The draw effect is a nice plus too.</p> <p><strong>*Magicalized Fusion</strong>: This one is an interesting tech. Is a Spell card that allows the Fusion Summon of a Spellcaster Fusion monster by banishing its materials from the field or GY, pretty much how Dragon's Mirror works. Since they are many Spellcasters in the Deck, I though adding 1 copy of it and 1 <strong>Quintet Magician</strong> as a Plan B.</p> <p><strong>**Pot of Avarice</strong>: This Deck can consume a lot of resources due to how much milling and searching can do. Pot of Avarice can help to recycle your used monsters and giving you 2 cards.</p> <p><strong>***Super Polymerization</strong>: Is a Quick-Play Spell that requires to discard 1 card to activate. You can then Fusion Summon 1 Fusion monster by using materials from both fields. Also, neither player can activate cards or effects in response to it. Since the <strong>Shaddoll</strong> Fusions are kind of generic in terms of their materials, <strong>Super Poly</strong> can easily remove from your opponent's field a problematic monster and give you a Fusion, without your opponent being able to stop it.</p> <p><strong>*Quintet Magician</strong>: Is a big Level 12 DARK Spellcaster with 4500 ATK/DEF and requires 5 Spellcaster monsters to be Fusion Summoned. If those 5 Spellcaster monsters had different names between each other, on its Fusion Summon, you can destroy all cards your opponent controls. While on the field, it cannot be destroyed by card effects, can't be used as a Fusion Material and it cannot be Tributed. Being one of the few monsters in the game that cannot be <strong>Kaiju</strong>'d, his nuke effect and big statline paired with tolerable protection makes him an impressive optional boss monster.</p> <p><strong>*Mysterion the Dragon Crown</strong>: This one is also a tech choice, giving that I'm using <strong>Timaeus</strong>. Is a Level 8 LIGHT Spellcaster with 3000 ATK/1500 DEF that requires a Spellcaster monster and a Dragon monster. It cannot be used as Fusion material and loses 100 ATK for each of your banished cards. If a monster uses its own effect to Special Summon itself or any monster(s) with its same original Type, you can target 1 of those monsters: banish it and banish all monsters on the field with the same original Type. Decks that focus on only one Type of monster (like Spellcasters, Dragons, Cyberse, Rocks, Beast-Warriors, etc.) are pretty common both casually and in the Meta and monsters that can Special Summon more of them are pretty common as well, even <strong>Shaddolls</strong> have a few share of them. <strong>Mysterion</strong> can provide an easy wipe of said monsters, although watch out to now blow yourself up the process.</p> <p><strong>*Accesscode Talker</strong>: Another card that doesn't need that much introduction for how heavily it is played online. Emphasis on online since +$100 dollars is a very high price to most players. Still, it currently is one of the best finishers. If you want a budget option, <strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong> is always there.</p> <p><strong>*Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</strong>: Is a Link-3 LIGHT Spellcaster with 1850 ATK and points all Bottom (Bottom-Left, Bottom &amp; Bottom-Right). It requires 2 or more monsters, including at least 1 Spellcaster monster. On its Link Summon, you can place 1 Spell Counter on it for each Spell Card in your GY. During the Main Phase, as a Quick Effect, you can remove 3 Spell Counters from your field to Special Summon 1 Spellcaster monster from the hand or GY in Defense Position to a zone it points to. Is mostly used as an extender for more Fusion plays and for link climbing into <strong>Accescode/Borrelsword</strong>.</p> <p><strong>*Subterror Behemoth Fiendess</strong>: Even though it was design for <strong>Subterrors</strong>, it is the best Link monster to play with <strong>Shaddolls</strong>. Is a Link-2 EARTH Wyrm with 2000 ATK, points Bottom-Left and Bottom-Right and requires any 2 Flip monsters. It can send 1 Flip monster from the Deck to the GY to Special Summon 1 monster from your hand in face-down Defense Position. Once per turn, if one of the monsters this card points to is flipped face-up, you can add 1 Flip monster from the Deck or GY to the hand. Since <strong>Reincarnation</strong> can flip your Shaddoll monsters and <strong>Schism</strong> can use materials from the GY for Fusion Summons, this is an overall nice card to have at disposition.</p> <p>And that's it for this Deck.</p> <p>I'll have to make an announcement: Since school started again a month ago, I'll upload decks probably more late than ever. At least except 2 or even 3 decklist per month, but not on a consistent schedule. Since tomorrow is the beginning of October, although the website posts this as the next day idk, the next decklist will focus on the Zombie-themed Structure Decks that had been released in Yu-Gi-Oh!, with those being the <strong>Zombie Madness</strong>, <strong>Zombie World</strong> and <strong>Zombie Hoard Structure Decks</strong>; in which I'll implement a new rule for the remaining Structure Decks for this series.</p> <p>Oh, btw, I'll post the <strong>Starter Deck: Yugi</strong> list later, just as a throwaway.</p>"

See the power a single new card gave the Deck to enable acces,"<span>Hello everyone, Dragon Soul here</span>  <span>So I've always been a pretty big Orcust fan, and Ogdoadic at first aided the Deck pretty well. They were fun to play together and also pretty decently strong, even if they worked pretty separately with a similar strategy in the end and Aleirtt combined with them well. That however has now been fixed. I found the tie that connects the two decks' strategies together, and its pretty freaking insane what the Deck does now.</span>  <span>The Deck was fixed with a single card released:Â <a data-name=""Reptilianne Coatl"">Reptilianne Coatl</a>.Â </span>  <span>It's currently in the OCG as of the writing of this however I don't expect it to stay there for much longer. It's a Level 4 DARK Reptile Tuner that freely Summons itself from the hand if you control a DARK Reptile. Simple, but effective. The reason this card is so good however is it allows Ogdoadic an easy way to Synchro Summon thanks to <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> and <a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a> getting access to it easily. But...what do you Synchro Summon then? What 1 Synchro could you possibly make to tie these two decks much better together.Â </span>  <span>One of the most overpowered Level 8 Synchros to ever exist, <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a>.</span>  <span>On Synchro Summon, you mill 5 cards, and get to add a LIGHT or DARK monster amongst them to your hand. FIVE cards. This means that although sure, its not guaranteed you'll hit an <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a><a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">, it's pretty likely you'll hit something useful off it. It enables you to set up your Orcust plays and dump Ogdoadics while you're at it, plus add extenders to hand. That's already pretty solid, but that's not all it does. By banishing a LIGHT and DARK monster from your Graveyard, it can revive itself, so it gives you an extra body. Even though it banishes itself when it leaves the field,Â <strong>it doesn't matter.</strong></a></span>  <span>Since it is a Level 8 you can actually overlay it with either a <a data-name=""World Wand"">World Wand</a> or an Ogdoadic to Xyz Summon <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> normally, meaning it will go to the grave now. On top of that, even if it is banished, <a data-name=""Aliertt"">Aleirtt</a> can return it to your Graveyard and get back a LIGHT Ogdoadic you banished for more banish fodder to revive it again. This is where it gets kind of hectic, because now, Chaos Ruler is able to be used every single turn for a free body and board presence, meaning the Deck has higher recovery.</span>  <span>On the note of recovery though, this Deck's recovery outclasses literally every Deck in the game. Even Eldlich cannot recover and grind to the same level as this Deck. (I tested against Eldlich incase you were wondering. Even if they got me into a grind game I just kept playing and playing and playing and eventually I overwhelmed them.) It does take a bit to set up sure but that's fine honestly. Especially since each piece to the Deck only needs 1 card in the opening hand to get going most of the time.Â </span>  <span>Another strength is actually how both Decks cover each others weaknesses. So what are those weaknesses then? For Orcust, its 3 main things. One of them is Lancea, another is any form of Extra Deck lock (so for example you get Scythed), and finally, handtraps. Let's go through how Ogdoadic manages to override all 3 of these problems for the Deck.</span>  <span>1. Lancea. As anybody knows, if Orcust cannot banish, they just do not work. And Lancea proves this perfectly, it seals our Orcusts away almost entirely, as well as Chaos Ruler's revival effect. But Ogdoadic in contrast, will punish your opponent for activating it as quickly as they can. <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu</a> can revive itself for free but banishes itself when it leaves the field, and whatever <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse</a> revives is also banished when it leaves the field. But due to Lancea...they won't get banished. Meaning if you Lancea the Deck, you are just allowing them to keep their Ogdoadic resources for next turn without needing to use Aliertt to get them back or needing to dump any more, plus the next turn will result in MASSIVE follow up. Plus, the Ogdoadics will give you that turn with their own board presence. Lancea still hurts for sure, but being able to flip it against them in some ways is not bad to see.</span>  <span>2. Extra Deck locks. Dragon Buster, Scythe, we all know that. And Orcust can't play without their Extra Deck, its their lifeline. No <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a>, no Dingirsu, not even Chaos Ruler, definitely it will hurt no matter what you do. But Ogdoadic again finds a way to counter and minimize the threat of it. Simply put it, Ogdoadic isÂ <strong>not</strong> a Deck that actually needs its Extra Deck. It's more reliant on its Main Deck, and instead, you turn your Graveyard into your ""Extra Deck"", with bosses like <a data-name=""Amunessia"">Amunessia</a>, Aron and <a data-name=""Ogdoabyss"">Ogdoabyss</a>. They can take care of pretty annoying stuff, not to mention Ogdoabyss can remove a Buster Lock often times (meaning your Extra Deck is free and you can go off).</span>  <span>3. Handtraps. Orcust eats them, and can get stuck without the right extenders. Normal Girsu, get Impermed, your turn might as well be over if you don't have very specific extension. And Ogdoadic yet again counters this well. Ogdoadic can just force out handtraps and isn't reliant on a Normal Summon. So it can clear the way for your Orcusts to go through, or punish your opponent for waiting for your Orcusts. The Deck uses Spells and hand monster effects to get their cards in grave, so handtraps hitting those leave room for Normal Summon options, not to mention you still paid cost so tossing Nunu or anything useful in grave off Snake Rain (like Knightmare) gives you advantage despite the attempted handtrap. And since they play from the grave, their effects are very difficult to hit without specific handtraps like Ghost Belle or Skull Meister. Now why did I say they ""punish"" your opponent for handtrapping the Orcusts? Well you tend to have Amunessia out in your boards, and if your opponent has been waiting for that Knightmare in Grave to be activated so they can Ash it, they're not going to like what happens after. Ashing or Meistering the Knightmare will let Amunessia revive a LIGHT or DARK Reptile from your grave (only DARK if you do get locked under Orcust lock, but if Knightmare was the first then that will be negated there), and you can revive Aliertt to return Knightmare to grave for next turn. Or if you already used Aliertt, use the Summoned monster and another Level 8 (Chaos Ruler?) for Dingirsu, attach Knightmare for next turn, and suddenly that handtrap isn't looking so good.</span>  <span>So what about Ogdoadic's weaknesses? Can Orcust fix them? Well there's some issues with Ogdoadic definitely that Orcust has ways to mitigate.</span>  <span>1. End Boards. Ogdoadic is...not incredibly impressive with its end boards. King and Queen and cool to see but that's not very effective on its own. They can board brake with Ogdoabyss well but turn 1 plays are kind of weird. On 1 hand you don't give your opponent back free advantage from Aliertt and Keurse, but on the other, you don't do anything really. Orcust fixes this to allow them to make actual end boards turn 1 that can sit alongside a Queen or King sometimes, and then use the strong follow up plays to grind the game out or just OTK from there, depending on the matchup and how they do trying to break your board. You can often end on a triple material Dingirsu, an <a data-name=""I:P"">I:P</a>, a Queen or King (sometimes both), <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a>, and sometimes <a data-name=""Orcust Cresendo"">Orcust Cresendo</a> and <a data-name=""Galatea"">Galatea</a>. I say sometimes since it all depends on your hand and if you got enough extension to make those plays.</span>  <span>2. Board Presence. The Deck mounts great comebacks...if you can attain the board presence to make those happen. Water Lily is a great card with Ogdoabyss but its not going to always be enough, and sometimes you don't have it in hand and need to get <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya</a> to fetch it for you. But Girsu single handedly fixes that issue turn 1 anyway, and later on thanks to Babel you can put more bodies out from Cymbal Skeleton on your opponent's turn to use for both disruption (Dingirsu send) and Tribute fodder for the Ogdoadics on your next turn. The board presence also means Amunessia is easier to Summon, don't forget she is DARK so you can still have her Special Summon herself (in a Graveyard Link Summon kind of thing, that's how I like to think of it) under your Orcust lockdown effects. Also Chaos Ruler fixes the issue too since it revives itself for free every single turn, even if you are locked by Orcust effects.</span>  <span>It's fun, crazy, works together well, and is the all around most insane graveyard deck you'll ever find. Well...until you get Abyss Dwellered and it comes back to bite you lol. (The Deck dies so hard if your opponent manages to dweller you.) But yeah, regardless, that's the thoughts on the Deck and how it all works, list is down below. Seriously, try it out and experiment with the combos, you won't regret it. Have fun!</span>"

The ratios for Frogs have never changed and while Toad is still crazy itâs not broken like it used to be. However, lightsworns give Frogs a much higher ceiling by being able to supply them will all the material they need to pop off. Currently, the biggest problem Iâve found is that the deck really struggles going second and when unlucky mills can end a turn. I know very little about Lightsworns and I would love any feedback I get about better engines or ratios for those or other ideas/theories in general.Â </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thank you for your time and I wish you the best.Â </span>  &nbsp;"

Draco future actually has more protection than dragoon and imo hasÂ  a more impactful effect.  Not letting your opponents cards go to grave is actually very handy in the current meta. You can easily open 3 toad 1 draco future with hand traps to spare.  Desires is brick prevention as it does happen. Double summon because the deck is very fragile, double summon all but solves that. Soul rope is kind of a personal tech, where if they break my board through my negates I can potentially summon barrier statue from deck.  Main combo is :  Summon Lantern shark which summons buzzsaw shark from hand. Activate buzzsaw shark, which summons another fish from deck. Summon bahamut detach material for toad. Layer vespenato on top of bahamut. Effect of remora detach 2 materials from anywhere on field, summon itself, then summon 2 fish from grave. (the ones you detached) Repeat bahamut into toad 2 more times (you should have toad in extra monster zone, bahamut, and 4 level 4 fish on field. Layer utopic future on top of leftover bahamuts. Layer draco future on top of him. ...? Profit  Side board is cards for if you know when you're going first or second. Swap out hand traps for these.  You can tech any rank 4 xyz into this deck, but my choices are for the following reasons.  Malevolent sin is non destruction spot removal that helps you to swing in for lethal as the monsters sort of lack in attack. Tornado dragon because tornado dragon Abyss dweller because anti meta Dark rebellion for some reason as sin, allows you to swing over pesky cards. Exciton is situational baby zeus and very efficiently layers into zeus.|  All I can think of for now, I might update later, enjoy.  Ps. Play ghost ogre, this card has won me games.   &nbsp;"

This deck consists in using timelords to burn and stall the opponent and to make it more consistent i use only 4 timelords (sandaion, michion, raphion and zaphion), as well as time maiden to search the timelords alongside with cards like foolish burial and one for one to make maiden effects more consistent. This deck also uses a small mystic mine engine that focuses on searching and ativating mystic mine from deck like demise of the land, metaverse and terraforming, and on top of that i run spell/trap protection like solemn judgement and dark bribe to protect mystic mine and other important cards (and since i use mine, i theorically dont need to worry to much about monster effects since mystic mine will most likely be on the field anyways). Furthermore, i also run the trap timelord engine, and while its slow on their own, its pretty good on this deck because of how easy is to get mystic mine (and protect it) on the field, so basically you have empty machine that cannot be destroyed once per turn and lets either yyou discard alevel 10 monster to draw a card or if the card is the only one on your spell/trap zone you can return a timelord from gy to deck to set infinite machine from deck; then you have infinite machine that can only be activated by sending an empty machine you control, then it cannot be destroyed once per turn and lets you either . special a timelord from your hand during your main phase or return a timelord from your gy to the deck to set infinite light from your deck; and lastly you have infinite light, that can only be activated by sending an infinite machine you control to gy, then it cannot be destroyed at all and prevent your timelord from being targetted or from being returned to deck (and thats applies to your own timelords effects as well), then once per turn if you control no monster, you can special one timelord from each hand, deck and gy, ignoring their summoning conditions (if you get at this point, you most likely won the game). Other thant that we have some draw power, removals and the extradeck is either for toolbox or extravagance target."

Since Carrier is long banned by now, the only other ED solution I could find, was Reprodocus changing Nightingale into a Cyberse and then boost it by 2k with Cyberse Accelerator. This needs 4 materials on Nightingale, wich, however, is easier than ever with the introduction of Celeste Wagtail. If insufficient, ramming a leftover Starling into your opponents Dragoon usually does the job. The Appliancers make Starlings. That is their purpose.  The deck almost always kills if uninterrupted (then again, everything does these daysâ¦), and if not, AssembledÂ Nightingale usually guarantees you a second shot.  It's honestly not worth memorizing all the restrictions and summoning lines to <em>not</em> lock yourself mid combo when you could just play a good deck. Unless you find this funny.  <strong>Components</strong>  Lyriluscs: Self-explanatory original core; I only run one of each of the new ones because Celeste does nothing by itself and is a hard OPT and Beryl Canary locks you out of Links. 3 Bird Call despite the hard OPT cause you always want it and 1 Sanctuary for the draw. Occasionally you can stack stuff under Nightingale to edge out a win.  Appliancer Engine: 3 Socketroll, Copybukkle and World + Terra and 1 Kappa in ED. The one Kappa enables you use Worlds recovery to get back a Socketroll, so World plus any of the other two equals 4 usable materials.  Generic LV1 Extenders: The new Slower swallow is searchable. Very nice. 2 Jester andÂ Booster, just filler.  Other Spells: Where Arf Thou? (obviously), Instant Fusion 'cause Millennium-Eyes stops Ash and it can summon Independent, Foolish for Warbler and Canary setup as well as Wagtail, and Lightning Storm because going second. One of each of Requital and Jack cause dead cards suck.  Extra: Proxy to access Independent Nightingale in MP2, Robin and F0 if you can't OTK. Also 1 arrogant Bird, buys you a turn if needed. I'd throw in a Zeus if I was serious, but that doesn't OTK.  Side Deck: Handtraps + budget (searchable) Dark Ruler for going second. Harpie's Feather Storm for the same occasion, also shuts down all handtraps if it survives a turn."
