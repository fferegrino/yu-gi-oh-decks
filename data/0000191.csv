Special summon Junk Converter, then synchro summon Junk Speeder, after that, using Junk Speeder's effect special summon: Road Synchron, Steam Synchron, Fleur Synchron and Changer Synchron. Using Junk Speeder, Road Synchron, Steam Synchron and Fleur Synchron, synchro summon Red Supernova Dragon.  &nbsp;  Once you get rid of Road Synchron and Fleur Synchron from your deck and CS from the field, you can activate RSD's quick effect (only triggers when your opponent activates a monster's effect or when they attack), banish all cards your opponent controls but also RSD too. Once this step is complete all you have to do is normal summon Junk Synchron, then special summon Junk Converter from the GY. This will trigger Doppelwarrior (must be in your hand) so special summon him, then synchro summon another Junk Speeder from the Extra Deck using Junk Synchron and Junk Converter as materials. Using Junk Speeder's effect, special summon Junk Synchron and Cyberse Synchron from the deck on to your field. Synchro summon T. G. Hyper Librarian using DW and JS, then using one of DW's tokens and CS, synchro summon Formula Synchron, then draw 2 cards. Once they're all on the field you can then freely synchro summon Stardust Sifr Divine Dragon (if you draw Synchro Chase, activate it then special summon Librarian once the synchro summon of SSDD is complete). If Red Supernova Dragon's effect is activated last turn, during the end phase: special summon him.  &nbsp;  Reload, Magical Mallet, Reinforcements of The Army, Card Destruction and Allure of Darkness should make this a lot easier to pull off.  &nbsp;"

Just spam summons until you get wise strix and force and then you have to make a decicion what to do next. If you feel save, want to summon ultimate falcon and haven't already through last strix and skip force, you want to either(if you already have a rank up in your hand) get launch through wise and activate it(use raider's wings(from wise) for force to strip it from its materials) and make force to stranger falcon, then to arsenal and then destroy it with bardiche or you skip stranger with phantom knights' force(wise) but then you can't link anymore(or you do it last). If you have done this it is possible to also get Borrelsword and one of the XYZ Dragons(if you want requiem with triple negate(in one turn) you can't use phantom knights' force for ultimate) on the field (with luck and training). The other option is to ditch ultimate and fokus on 5 negates with fog blade, phantom knights' claw and requiem. Either way after wise comes bardiche.  (1. Tipp: If you want to go the arsenal falcon route and you already used the second effect of  strange linus and the effect of raider's wings(which you should) summon mimicry through arsenal for extra card search when he is in GY)  I always thought raidraptor is the inferior version of blackwing, because of the many effects that hinder special summons from monsters other than raidraptor, but if you pick the pearls most of them have a second effect other than special summon that puts them on pair with blackwing, sometimes even better (turn not completely ruined because of one negate) which has its own uniqueness.

A simple ""Cyber Art"" deck and yet the one I love the most. Made for fun play.","So, with the new (by me highly anticipated) Cyber Strike Structure Deck coming up, which is really coming closer and closer, I decided to upload my 3rd deck here and my probably most favorite deck of all time: My very own Cyber Dragon deck. I started playing this deck in Legacy of the Duelist and immediately fell in love with it. So much so that I right after playing it for some duels, I had to buy it in real. A deck purely focused on pure beat down and in this category, it's really the John Cena of YuGiOh. On top of that it comes with a good amount of reliable searchers, which makes it very consistent. A deck that had such a strong impact on the game, considered a classic with lovely, modern support. With all this foreshadowing done, I wanna get right to the deck and how it works.  Put the opponents Life Points to zero. Done.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/dQyPg0d.png"" alt=""image"" />  ...Okay, alright. It might not be that inzanely easy. Or is it? First of all, I can definetely assure you, you will never pull a dead hand. If you can't go right into a huge swarm of metallic, flying serpents or a large, purple beatstick, you can at least go into.. A large, blue beatstick? The ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Sieger"">Cyber Dragon Sieger</a>"" (german for ""Winner"") helps you to be safe against every attack from your opponent, as it's a 2100 ATK monster that how ever can just make it's own ATK become 4200 once you or your opponent enters the Battlephase. And it only need's two of your monsters to get it out. Working as a strong monster or as a buffer; being able to give your other ""Cyber Dragon""-monsters the 2100 ATK buff instead of itself; it really is a reliable ""go-first"" possibility. Keep in mind that summoning at least two monsters in one round is basicly guaranteed with this deck. ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Vier"">Cyber Dragon Vier</a>"" (german for the number ""four"") for example can be special summoned from your hand once you summon another ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>"", which is basicly every card in your deck due to the Cyber Dragon monsters effects of becoming <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a> in your graveyard or on the field. Another possibility is via ""Cyber Dragon Core"", which uppon summoning let's you search every single ""Cyber""-Spell/Trap card. Searching for ""<a data-name=""Cyber Revsystem"">Cyber Revsystem</a>"", which then let's you summon a (indestructable) monster. This of course is not the only way to get out your metal beasts, but one example. So as you can see, going out of your round will most likely not go without you having a bunch of monsters out or one very strong monster. While the monsters absorbing ""<a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a>"" or the Winning Link machine are powerful monsters already, the stuff that really makes the deck are the huge Fusion Monsters of course. ""<a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>"" is a 2800 monster classic that can attack twice per Battlephase while ""<a data-name=""Chimeratech Overdragon"">Chimeratech Overdragon</a>"" can stack this up even further, letting you attack the amounts of time that you used monsters for its Fusion summoning. And of course the legendary ""<a data-name=""Cyber End Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a>"" that is easily summoned with ""<a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a>"" with 8000 ATK and piercing damage. Just be aware of possible heart attacks when doing so.  Besides Power Bond (which by the way can be searched out with ""<a data-name=""Cyber Pharos"">Cyber Pharos</a>"" which on the other side can be searched out with ""<a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a>"") you have ""<a data-name=""Cyberload Fusion"">Cyberload Fusion</a>"" to summon your Fusion Monsters. A good way to get a huge bunch of Cyber Dragons to your banned cards mountain is via ""<a data-name=""Cyber Network"">Cyber Network</a>"". It keeps giving you a fresh supply of banished Cyber Dragons to use with your Cyberload Fusion and if there are Cyber Dragons left bannished once Cyber Networks time is over, you can summon all of them to your field to use to your hearts content, even tho their effects cant be activated. Passive effects s well as those that don't have to be manually activated by you, still work. A little, hidden gem in my eyes is ""<a data-name=""Super Strident Blaze"">Super Strident Blaze</a>"". Aside of the primary effect which you don't have to activate to also not suffer to it's downside, it comes with a passive effect which is always there as soon as you equip it to your Fusion Monster of your choice: Your opponent is locked out of activating effects while you are in your most important phase: the Battlephase.  I'm usually not the person to use much of an Extra deck, but in this case I must say that ""<a data-name=""Iron Call"">Iron Call</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Iron Draw"">Iron Draw</a>"" as well as an additional Cyber Dragon Sieger can be a very good choice. I usually swap those with ""<a data-name=""Cybernetic Revolution"">Cybernetic Revolution</a>"" as well as ""<a data-name=""Cybernetic Hidden Technology"">Cybernetic Hidden Technology</a>"" and sometimes even the Strident Blaze cards. Of course you can switch out every other card as you see fit as well, but that's how I go.  This deck is obviously not made for competitive play in any way and soley made for casual and fun play. Altho with Cyber Dragons still being a deck theme that sees play in competitive YuGiOh, I must warn you. In fun circles this deck might f&#x2665;ck up your friends, as it can be very ... Overwhelming sometimes. Or to say it lightly, a ""weaker"" deck in therms of fun play might not have a really good/fair time against it, due to it's strength and the consistently strong performance. At least on comparison to other fun decks. I hope you still have a good time with it if you decide to try it out. <blockquote><div><em>You'll be the best, so make me proud.</em></div></blockquote> &nbsp;  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/S1qsfqb.png"" alt=""image"" />  Discord: Lucy&#x1f497;&#x1f33a;&#x1f98b;#1508  <a>Reddit</a>  <a>Steam</a>"

First of all it was ahead of its time with a brillant  remover, a non-targeting  and non-destruction  remover. Second of all it’s a OTK machine that was getting better and better along these years, and was a shame to not get a structure deck in the 2019 poll (losing to Shaddoll, Sacred beast and now infamous  Charmer deck). I personally find it a little difficult to play with this deck, ‘cause it has so many lines to play that I got confused (although i’m not a very smart girl). But here we are with a lot of new supports, infinite lines to play and a deck so sweet that might cause diabetes to your opponents.</span>  <span>And so this was my top choice to the now “past”  remote YCS  South America. That was my first remote  duel and my first competitive event,so I chose Madolche ‘cause I love this deck from the bottom of my heart and, also,  it is one of my most played decks of all time that I felt comfortable to use in a competitive environment. Did I good? Did I like it? In conclusion we will see. </span>  &nbsp;  <b><i>Disclaimers</i></b>  <span>When I try to build a deck I like to use cards that I already have</span><i><span>,</span></i><span>thus I rarely have the new staples for exemple. So the majority of cards that you’ll see can be considered a budget option for certain cards, in other words no Access code talker. However  I hope you like my choices for certain cards and if you have any questions or tips, please message me.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Starters</i></b></span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a>: </b><span>this cute girl can tribute herself to summon any madolche monster from the deck, preferably </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span> to start her combo because she was a special summon or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span> to extend your plays.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>: </b><span> a newcomer where the new broken combo resides. This little girl can special summon herself from your hand with you having no monster in your GY and, on top of that, summon another madolche from your deck but this monster will have 1 level less than the original . The way that she can trigger her second  effect by any special summon is insane, so if she was summon  by  </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a> </b><span>  you also would summon another Madolche monster , like </span><span> </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> </b><span> for instance to proceed to XYZ plays.</span>  <b>2x</b> <b><a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>:  </b><span>The primary function of this owl is to summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a> </b><span> to start your combos  and put some protection , but it can  maybe summon </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> </b><span> or </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a> </b><span>to use some different line of plays.

Furthermore when a madolche card is shuffled back in the deck you can set a madolche spell/trap card from your deck, and this will happen a lot. It is everything we ever wanted.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>3x <a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a>: </b><span>add any madolche monster to your hand and it’s a non hard once per turn effect , so in conjunction with </span><b><a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> </b><span> this card can show its true potential.</span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Madolche Messengelato"">Madolche Messengelato</a>: </b><span>This dude has the insane non hard once per turn effect in all archetypes.  Summoned most of the time by the effect of </span><b> <a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>, </b><span> the ability to add any madolche spell/trap card for a simple special summon it’s amazing.

This card can shut down decks like drytron (that was so prevalent), Tri-brigade stuff  and so many others. However this card does not stop plays( like Ash Blossom does) and it’s a high impact hand trap that have to accomplish a specific condition. So I decided to side it and thank goodness I did. </span>  &nbsp;  <b>2x <a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a>; 1 x </b><b><a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a></b><b>: </b><span>with so many GY plays like </span><b><a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a>,</b> <b><a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a>, </b><span> Dragon link or even Virtual world… this adorable ghost girl will be one of your best friends in this format.</span><b><a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a> </b><span>is basically a male belle.

Some duels  was extreme fun  like One that I had with a Uruguayan man,: I started with a standard madolche board and when was his time to play he said “ end of battle phase” And I only saw a purple card  </span><b><a data-name=""Evenly Match"">Evenly Match</a>, </b><span> but for some reason he forgot that I had Lancea at my hand, both of us laugh so hard. In another duel I used </span><b><a data-name=""Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill"">Ghost Mourner &amp; Moonlit Chill</a> </b><span>to negate a</span><b>  <a data-name=""Zoodiac Boarbow"">Zoodiac Boarbow</a>, </b><span>and this brazilian guy's rage quit… And I can't stop laughing</span><span>. In some duels I had an extreme ruling contest and I got really frustrated with it. LAG, bad connection (I live in a rural area, but my internet is at least 100mb), and.. I had enough and I Scooped. My final score was the solid 3-2-3, a frustrating experience but a funnie one. I hope you enjoy it   </span>"

This deck also utilizes <em>Macro Cosmos</em> and <em>Dimensional Fissure </em>as a meta-call against decks like Tri-Brigade, Drytron, and Sky Striker who heavily play around their GY's. This archetype has a lot of 1 card combos and can create powerful level 7-10 Synchro Monsters for almost every situation; just be careful with cards like <em>Droll and Lock Bird </em>and <em>Nibiru</em> as they can stop you from your combo plays.

I tested Cards like lightning storm and you can use it instead of raigeki and twin twisters if you have 2-3 of them. You want to search for your normal summon/tuner monsters if you didn't draw them in the start of the game and you want to make your synchco monsters (whatever it is you want to make at the time) and make a big board. If you're running out of plays, you can make Greatfly/Picofalena to link off to recycle your grave yard.

The main deck uses the same tactics to acheive the win as before, going second and OTK'ing, or board breaking and preventing the opponent from coming back. Either swinging with Gren Maju after banishing so many cards for the win, or using the level 8's along with the XYZ's to break boards or control the game long enough to OTK.  The main deck has some key changes. 2 Phantazmay have now been put into the main deck. Although Dragon Link is no longer as prevalent, Phantazmay is highly useful against Tri-Brigade, Ignister and Striker to both draw extra cards that could help break boards, as well as offering targeting protection which allows the deck to play around Striker more easily, as the matchup can be a pretty rough one sometimes.  Super Poly has now been relegated to the side deck due to Striker now being more prevalent, the card being useless against Prank Kids, Eldlich and Ignister, and also not always being useful in the Tri-Brigade matchups. Triple Tactics Talent took its place, and is extremely useful at allowing the deck to push through hand traps and other interruptions.  The Extra Deck no longer has the 2 N'tss. While it is useful against Dogmatika, it has no utility against anything else. Pain Gainer allows me to gave a 4 material Zeus, which can really come in clutch. Violet Chimera is an extra super poly target that can be used vs Salamangreat.  There Can Be Only One has now been dropped. With many decks likely to be using some main deck Spell/Trap removal now the striker matchup has returned, and Different Dimension Ground being able to acheive a similar stun effect i felt the card was not needed. In it's place, Eradicator Epidemic Virus allows me to blowout anything that relies on spells/traps (namely Invoked/Shaddoll, Striker, Drytron and other backrow).  Feel free to comment and like the deck!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

The Main Deck also includes a small number of retrained monsters designed to allow the Deck to function as a cosplay deck first, and to help the Deck out second - for example, ""Obnoxious Celtic Guard"" is useful for creating ""Gilti-Gearfried"", but is primarily there because it is a Yugi/Atem card. Similarly, ""Ankuriboh"" is there so that a Yugi Deck can have a defensive Kuriboh card, with its other benefits being of secondary concern. This ""problem"" is particularly egregious in the Side Deck, where the Monsters and Traps in particular are designed to be upgrades/retrains/nods to some of Yugi's classic cards or classic DM-era cards (albeit in the case of ""Gravedigger's Trap Hole"" somewhat tenuously, as it is only a ""Trap Hole"" in the TCG, not in the OCG). If trying to make this Deck more playable in even slightly more competitive environments, these could easily all be swapped out for more traditional hand traps/anti-meta cards/current staples and the like, and furthermore, whilst the Deck in its current form is very fun, focusing either on the Egyptian God element with Slime support and Mound of the Bound Creator and the like, or on the Extra Deck element with more Warrior support, would no doubt produce better results."

This deck could also utilizes <em>Macro Cosmos, Dimensional Shifter</em> and <em>Dimensional Fissure </em>as a meta-call against decks like Tri-Brigade, Drytron, and Sky Striker who heavily play around their GY's (the Side deck contains at the Moment different ideas for the future Version of this deck).  This archetype has a lot of 1 card combos and can create powerful level 7-12 Synchro Monsters for almost every situation; just be careful with cards like <em>Droll and Lock Bird </em>and <em>Nibiru</em> as they can stop you from your combo plays. The deck is flexible first or second, but going first with a<em> Baroness De Fleur </em>end board is usually ideal.  You can decide to cut the Tenyi support in order to play more hand traps."

Check out the new version here: https://ygoprodeck.com/wrath-of-the-conductor-paleozoic-era/</span></p> <span>The main focus of this deck is the summoning of high ATK power monsters, mainly <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno<span>.</span></span></span>  <span><span><em><span>Frostosaurus</span></em></span>: 1 Tribute, 2600 ATK. Can be easily summoned using <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> or <span>Hunting Instinct</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Megalosmasher X</span></em></span>: Solid 2000 ATK, <span>4 stars</span>, useful for <span>Synchro</span>/<strong>X<span>YZ summoning</span></strong>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Black Brachios</span></em></span>: Useful for revealing face-down monsters, or disrupting a high attacker.</span> <span><span><em>Destroyersaurus</em></span>: Can be discarded to add the deck's only Field Card to the hand, and fulfills one half of <span><span>Ultimate Conductor</span> <span>Tyranno's</span></span> Special Summon condition.</span> <span><span><em>Miscellaneousaurus</em></span>: Can be discarded to protect your monsters from effects during the main phase, and fulfills one half of <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno's</span> Special Summon condition. Has a Special Summon effect that doesn't see much use unless the duel goes on for a very long time, and you have at least 4 dinosaurs in your GY.</span> <span><span><em>Scrap Raptor</em></span>: The decks only tuner monster, and the only <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur Tuner that exists as of now. It's effect only functions within it's archetype, so it can be ignored.</span> <span><span><em><span>Souleating Oviraptor</span></em></span>: The most important card in this deck. Can be used to add any Dinosaur from the deck to either your hand, or GY. This can get you <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> early on, can provide you with your Tuner, or if <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> is set, instant access to <span>Frostosaurus</span> or <span>Ultimate Tyranno</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span></em></span>: The most powerful card in the deck, <span>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</span> can only be Special Summoned by banishing 2 Dinosaurs from the Graveyard. With the combined efforts of <span>Destroyersaurus</span>, <span>Miscellaneousaurus</span>, <span>Souleating Oviraptor</span>, and <span>Synchro</span> <span>Summoning</span>, this is very easily achieved. <span>U.C.T.</span> can attack all monsters your opponent controls, instantly destroying any DEF position monsters while inflicting 1000 points of damage in the process.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ultimate Tyranno</span></em></span>: Similar to <span>U.C.T.</span>, but without the ability to instantly destroy defense position monsters. If this monster is on your field, it must attack every monster before your other monsters can attack. Try not to use this guy when <span>U.C.T.</span> is present.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fossil Dig</span></em></span>: Used to grab any dino from the deck aside from either of the Tyrannos</span> <span><span><em><span>Jurassic World</span></em></span>: A small ATK and DEF boost for dinos.</span> <span><span><em><span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span></em></span>: Protects you from attacks for 3 turns.</span> <span><span><em><span>Tail Swipe</span></em></span>: A useful field clearing ability. Requires you to control a <span>Level 6</span> or higher dino. Best used when <span>Frostosaurus</span> is the strongest monster you control on the field.</span> <span><span><em><span>Call Of The Haunted</span></em></span>: Revives a monster from the GY. If <span>U.C.T.</span> has made it out on to the field at least once, it can be revived.</span> <span><span><em><span>Dust Tornado</span></em></span>: Destroys a Spell or Trap.</span> <span><span><em><span><span>Hunting Instinct</span></span></em><span>: </span>An easy way to get your high level dinos onto the field.<em><span> <span>Mirror Force</span></span></em><span>: </span>Destroys all of your opponent's attack position monsters.<em><span> <span>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</span></span></em><span>: </span>Negates Trap Cards.</span></span> <span><span><em><span>Survival Of The Fittest</span></em></span>: Adds 1000 ATK to any dino. Most useful on the <span>Level 4</span> dinos, as the higher level ones already have huge attack powers and can clear the field easily. Destroying a monster with the ATK boosts allows the monster to make a second attack on monsters.</span> <span><span><span><em>Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate</em></span></span>: [1 Dinsoaur Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters] The deck's only <span>Synchro</span> Monster. This monster is very powerful. It becomes the attack magnet while it is face-up, it can destroy a single monster once per turn, your opponent cannot activate Spells/Traps while it is attacking, and you can sacrifice another card you control if this guy would be destroyed. A great target for <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> if it somehow gets taken out. Can easily be <span>Synchro Summoned</span> using <span>Scrap Raptor</span> and almost any other dino in the deck.</span> <span><span><em><strong>Evolzar Dollka</strong></em></span>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] Useful for negating monster effects. Can be done twice using it's material</span> <span><span><em><strong>Evolzar Laggia</strong></em></span>: [2 <span>Level 4</span> Dinosaur monsters] The most versatile of the 3 XYZ's, <strong>Laggia</strong> can negate a single Summon, or Spell/Trap activation</span> <span><span><em><strong>Evolzar Solda</strong></em></span>: [2 <span>Level 6</span> Dinosaur monsters] Very rarely used, I just included with the rest of the Evolzar's so it wouldn't feel left out.</span>"

Discard cards to negate and banish, and search after doing so. M","<p><span>As indicated in their name, Plunder Patroll is a deck wherein the shipmates consist of pirates/vikings (the ""plunder"" aspect), who are also trolls (the ""-troll"" in Plunder Patroll, hence the extra ""l""). Their play-style focuses around summoning Black-, White-, or Redbeard in order to activate their effects during the opponent's turn to Special Summon a Plunder Patrollship from your Extra Deck, as long as that summoned Ship has the same attribute as a monster card that your opponent controls or is in their graveyard. Let's talk a bit more in-detail on the cards themselves, from the Plunders to the extra cards in the deck:</span></p> <span><strong>The Plunder Patrolls (and their Spells and Traps) -</strong></span> <span><strong><a data-name=""Whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm"">Whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm</a></strong>: Whitebeard is, without a doubt, one of the best Plunder Patroll cards. All the Main Deck Plunders are Level 4 WATER Fiend monsters, however, Whitebeard is one of the few Tuner monsters. Previously aforementioned, Whitebeard can tag itself out into the Spell/Trap zone as an equip card, by Special Summoning a Plunder Patrollship from your Extra Deck, as long as that Ship's attribute is the same as a monster that is on your opponent's field or is in their graveyard. Additionally, when discarded or sent from the monster zone to the graveyard, Whitebeard can Special Summon a Plunder from your Deck, locking you into Plunders. All of the Ships discard a Plunder card to activate an effect, and search immediately after. This means, by discarding for a Plunder Patrollship's effect, you can trigger Whitebeard to Special Summon a Plunder to your side of the field, potentially for use by Blackbeard. <strong><a data-name=""Redbeard, the Plunder Patroll Matey"">Redbeard, the Plunder Patroll Matey</a>: </strong>Redbeard, like Whitebeard, shares the ability to tag into the Spell/Trap zone and summon a corresponding Extra Deck Plunder monster. Redbeard also has the effect where when it is discarded or sent from the monster zone to the graveyard, it can equip itself to a Plunder you control. </span> <span><strong><a data-name=""Bluebeard, the Plunder Patroll Shipwright"">Bluebeard, the Plunder Patroll Shipwright</a>: </strong><span>Admittedly, Bluebeard is the worst of the Plunders. However, it is a Plunder name, so it must be played at triple copies. Bluebeard's main application is it's ability to Special Summon itself from the hand while you control a Plunder. A Bluebeard on board is a Ship in play, I say, as controlling two Plunder's gets you access to Blackbeard, as well as Moerk. And, if the other Plunder you controlled when Bluebeard's summon effect activated was a Tuner, then you can even make Brann. That is, if Moerk or Brann being hard-summoned is the correct move (A Dingirsu protection effect *<em>can*</em> be useful). When discarded or sent to the graveyard from the monster zone, Bluebeard can discard a card from your hand to draw one card. This isn't the most useful effect, but it can have some uses in discarded unneeded handtraps or as an additional way to trigger a Plunder effect. <strong><span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Goldenhair, the Newest Plunder Patroll"">Goldenhair, the Newest Plunder Patroll</a>: </span></strong><span class=""name_txt selectable"">While not the newest Plunder Patroll anymore, Goldenhair is imperative to the Plunder Patroll strategy. Before recent support, getting a Goldenhair into the graveyard was the primary objective for Plunder pilots, as while in the grave, at the cost of being locked into Plunders and a discard, Goldenhair can Special Summon herself back to field, providing a body, a name, and her use as a Tuner monster. Goldenhair has the ability to discard any card and Special Summon herself from the hand, but this effect is only used in poorer hands typically, as the hand advantage is a necessity in Plunder. You need the resources for your Patrollships. Regardless, a Goldenhair in rotation is extremely helpful in maintaining a board presence by giving you access to any Plunder Patrollship, all by controlling another main deck Plunder. <strong><a data-name=""Blackeyes, the Plunder Patroll Seaguide"">Blackeyes, the Plunder Patroll Seaguide</a>: </strong>Lastly, the newest Plunder Patroll card, we have Blackeyes (or as I prefer, Ravenwing). Blackeyes is phenomenal, and is truly what the deck was lacking. While in the hand, you can target a Plunder in your graveyard; Special Summon Blackeyes from your hand, and return the targeted card to your hand. Do you see it's applications? It gets back your resources, it summons itself, and at the end of the day, it's another Plunder name. Additionally, a discarded Blackeyes, or a Blackeyes sent from the monster zone to the graveyard, can Special Summon a Plunder that is equipped to a monster. While not always used, it is helpful in assembling lethal, as well as making more Ships.</span></span></span>  <strong><span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd"">Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd</a> (Field Spell): </span></strong><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Yes. The name is ""Shipyarrrd"". Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd is the deck's resident field spell. By discarding one card, you can search any Plunder Patroll card in your deck. This allows you to trigger the various Plunder effects, as well as get you to the one card you need. Discarding unneeded handtraps, or even discarding a Plunder for the sole purpose of bringing it back off of a searched Blackeyes are both good plays. Additionally, while in the graveyard, Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd can bounce a Plunder Patroll card in your Spell and Trap zone to the hand to set itself directly from the grave to your field, making it hard to actually out. This recursion not only means your field spell is most always online once you activate it that first time, but it also gets you Plunders in the hand when it bounces them in the Spell and Trap zone. Remember, Redbeard and Whitebeard become equip cards. Shipyarrrd has one more effect, that being that all Plunders you control gain 500 ATK for every Plunder in your Spell and Trap zone. This makes establishing lethal laughably easy. <strong><a data-name=""&lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;Emblem of the Plunder Patroll&lt;/span&gt;""><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Emblem of the Plunder Patroll</span> </a>(Equip Spell):</strong> Emblem of the Plunder Patroll is an incredible card, and goes to show the lengths that Equip Spells need to go to to be playable at any capacity. However, this deck only plays it at two copies capacity --- though you could play three, as it is worth it. While equipped to a Plunder, the monster gains 500 ATK and becomes untargetable. However, the real shine of Emblem is that by sending it as an equip card to the grave, you can Special Summon a Patrollship from your Extra Deck, whose attribute is the same as a monster on/in either player's field/graveyard. This means that Ash Blossom you discarded during your opponent's turn equals a Brann, just by being in your grave. Additionally, the Plunder that Emblem was originally equipped to becomes an equip card (with the effect of giving the card it equips onto 500 ATK) for the newly summoned Patrollship. <strong><span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping"">Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping</a></span> (Normal Spell):</strong> Say that twice as fast, I triple-Plunder-dare you. Shipshape Ships Shipping is the Fusion Spell of the deck, but that's not what you'll be using it for. By banishing it from the graveyard, you can equip an Emblem of the Plunder Patroll, or a Plunder monster, to a Plunder you control, straight from the deck. This gets you access to Ships turn one, and turns on your most powerful Ships by getting your equip cards into rotation. I don't suggest playing multiples, as it's balls to draw. <strong><a data-name=""&lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;Plunder Patroll Booty&lt;/span&gt;""><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Plunder Patroll Booty</span></a> (Continuous Trap):</strong> Plunder Patroll Booty is one of the most useful cards you could have access to in Plunder. Plunder's weakness is maintaining and having access to resources, as well as having access to the proper monster attributes without Emblem. Booty fixes both of those issues, kind of. Plunder Patroll Booty can return to your hand, or Special Summon, a Plunder in your grave, while changing the attribute of a monster your opponent controls to any of your choice. Don't have access to a DARK for Moerk? Target and declare DARK, then reborn a Blackbeard! I typically side a Booty out when going second, but that doesn't mean any less then three is good. Oh, and remember, you can't reborn a Ship that wasn't summoned properly. For example. a Moerk summoned off of Redbeard's effect cannot be Special Summoned back from the graveyard with Booty, because that Moerk wasn't Xyz Summoned the hard way.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Handtraps - </strong><span><a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion.""><span>The rest of the monsters I play are six handtraps: Triple copies of </span></a><a data-name=""Ash Blos&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;som &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Joyous&lt;/span&gt; Spring"">Ash Blossom <span class=""name_txt selectable"">&amp;</span> Joyous Spring</a>, and triple copies of <a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion"">Ghost Belle <span class=""name_txt selectable"">&amp;</span> Haunted Mansion</a><a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion."">. Realistically, these could be whatever handtraps you prefer. I've played Driver and Gamma, and it worked perfectly. Main-decking Nibiru is good as well. In the end, the choice is up to you, but I choose to play two playsets of low-impact handtraps in the main, and sideboard the more high-impact handtraps. However, </a><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a><a data-name=""Ghost Be&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lle &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;&amp;&lt;/span&gt; Haunte&lt;/span&gt;d Mansion.""> is also a handtrap, but it could be cut for whatever. I personally prefer Imperm in the main, as it has it's uses going first or second, and is generic enough to make an impact on most decks.</a></span></span>  <span><strong>Other Spells and Traps - </strong><span>At the end of the day, these cards can be anything of your choosing, but here's my explanation for each: <strong><a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: </strong>Desires is a plus one, in my eyes. And in Plunder, those extra cards are needed. You could maybe play Prosperity, but honestly, you need the extra card off of Desires more then you do a specific card. I don't recommend cutting this. <strong><a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a>: </strong>TTT is a flexible spot. I play TTT because of the applications: The draw for discards, the hand knowledge and removing potential handtraps and threats, and removing pesky monsters on board. While this could be <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>, another handtrap, blinding second staples, or anything you choose, I decided upon TTT. <strong><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>: </strong>Search Shipyarrrd. That's all. </span></span>  <strong><span>The Extra Deck -</span></strong><strong><span> <a data-name=""Blackbeard, &lt;span class=&quot;name_txt selectable&quot;&gt;the Plunder Patroll Captai&lt;/span&gt;n"">Blackbeard, <span class=""name_txt selectable"">the Plunder Patroll Captai</span>n</a> (Link 2): </span></strong><span>Blackbeard is what you'll be making more then anything else. Blackbeard has a Quick Effect to tag any effect monster you control into the Spell/Trap zone as an equip card for a Ship with the same attribute as a monster your opponent controls or is in their graveyard. This effect includes targeting itself. Additionally, after you summon, you can draw 1 card, to make sure you have a Plunder in hand for the Ship's discard. Blackbeard's tag-out effect is incredibly useful, as a combat trick, as an extender, or as the most basic way to get into your powerful ships, such as Lys or Moerk. </span><strong><a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Moerk"">Plunder Patrollship Moerk</a> (Rank 4 Xyz): </strong>Moerk, a generic rank 4 Xyz monster, has the ability to discard a Plunder card to banish a monster on the field. Since this is the first ship we're covering, I'll make it known all the ships have a discard effect, and then those effects become Quick Effects if they're equipped with a Plunder card (with the exception of Lys). Therefore, Moerk's banishing effect is a Quick Effect if a Plunder is equipped. Additionally, after all Ships discard and apply their effect, you can search a card from your deck. Moerk specifically allows you to add a Plunder Patroll Spell or Trap from your deck to your hand. Be weary though, as all of the Ship effects that search a card can be negated with Ash Blossom. You gain a different effect, however, if you have Xyz Material. If you hard-summoned Moerk, and have Xyz Material, then you have access to a Dingirsu-like effect where if a Plunder card you control would be destroyed, you can detach an Xyz material instead. <strong><a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Brann"">Plunder Patrollship Brann</a> (Level 8 Synchro): </strong><span class=""name_txt selectable"">Brann, a generic level 8 Synchro, has the ability to discard a Plunder to banish a Spell or Trap on the field, and then search a Plunder monster. This effect becomes a Quick Effect if a Plunder is equipped to Brann. Furthermore, Brann has an on field effect that boosts all your Fiends by 500 ATK, except itself. This ATK raise helps establish lethal, and two Brann can be game in most cases. <strong><a data-name=""Plunder Patrollship Lys"">Plunder Patrollship Lys</a> (2 Mat Fusion):</strong> Lys, a Fusion monster requiring two Plunders as Fusion Material, is the best Ship by far. Lys lets you discard a Plunder to negate and destroy a monster effect, and only searches if a Plunder is equipped. This means the negation is a Quick Effect always, and cannot be Ash Blossom'd in every case. Furthermore, the search itself adds any Plunder card. Lys also has the effect to Special Summon a Plunder from your Spell and Trap zone during the Main Phase, meaning you can remove the equipped card to prevent Lys from being Ash Blossom'd. The best way to activate this effect is to have made Lys with Blackbeard, then reborn the Blackbeard from the Spell and Trap zone to make another Ship. <strong><a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a><a data-name=""Bahamut Shark and Toadally Awesome""> and </a><a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> (Rank 4 and 2 Xyz)</strong>: During a turn in which you have not activated a Plunder effect that locks you into Plunders, it is incredibly easy to make Bahamut Shark. If you didn't know, Bahamut Shark has the ability to detach an Xyz Material to Special Summon a low-rank WATER Xyz monster from your Extra Deck, that being Toadally Awesome. Toad, while on the field, can negate a card effect and set that card to your field. Toad tributes itself to do so, but can return itself or a WATER in your grave to the hand when you do tribute it. <strong><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> (Link 3):</strong> Knightmare Unicorn is a discard outlet and removal. You don't make it often, but the option is there. This is one of the few flex spots in the Extra Deck. <strong><a data-name=""White Aura Whale"">White Aura Whale</a> (Level 8 Synchro):  </strong>When you aren't locked into Plunders, White Aura Whale is a crazy card to Synchro into. On Summon, it wipes the field of all of your opponent's Attack position monsters. Additionally, White Aura Whale can also attack twice in a battle phase and inflict piercing battle damage. And lastly, if it's destroyed, you can banish a WATER from your grave to reborn it as a Tuner. That reborn effect isn't once per turn, by the way. So, a really blowout card to make. <strong><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> (Level 8 Synchro): </strong>Dragite allows access for a negate right off the bat. This card goes best when going first after siding, because it turns off the opponent's going second blowout spells. There's not much explaining required here. Dragite is just a good, easy to make Synchro that negates. </span>  <span><strong>Conclusion? </strong><span>Plunder Patroll is easily one of my favorite decks, hence why I am sharing my current build here. I will be updating this as the list sees further change. The side deck is entirely up to your choice, as well as the handtraps and flex spots, such as Knightmare Unicorn and TTT. While not the strongest deck, Plunder makes for some of the most fun games I've ever had in this game. I hope you enjoy this deck as much as I have in recent days.</span><strong> </strong></span>"

Its consistency is amazing and ceil","Utopia has never been stronger, back in the day you could only negate when attacking or if you were really lucky you could maybe make a Zexal but now you can control the board at all times. The goal: set up double Leos with a Pegasus and Eagle Claw (one through Utopia Double, the other from Dragner), then on the opponents turn immediately after the draw phase summon a Hoper Harbinger using Dragner's remaining materials. If going second try to bring out a Magnus through Dreadnought should you expect to get hit with a Mystic Mine. Utopia Dragner is now the strongest monster in the deck in my opinion and he is the key to winning. With this deck you can very consistently make him every turn. Anyways the reason you should not play the deck at 40 cards is because you absolutely under no circumstances want to see a double or nothing spell or a ZW equip, having one is often the difference between being able to play through negates and completely being in dead waters. Additionally the deck requires versatility, if youre stuck with three copies of Onomatopickup or Onomatopaira youre probably scooping with just 40 cards because its a once per turn but with 60 you can add the monster, the field or the paira. The field Onomatopia is sooo good too, literally whatever extender you need it can summon from the deck easily and the attack bonus is good in keeping you even more protected(Number 23 being the main beneficiary). Zexal field is also up so that you can get more use out of Dragner and especially Number 23. Astraltopia is another awesome versitile card, it can get you the spell to draw on Utopia summons, the card to make Dragner, or the additional interruption in XYZ Import.  I hope you enjoy the deck  -Chief Kaiju Hunter"

When going second: Get all the problems out the way first before attempting to go for OTK on opponent. This would consist of monsters like Knightmare Unicorn/Pheonix or even an Avramax and attempt to win off these moves. You can also go for a Spatha with Arboria and Reclusia to prevent Reclusia's effect to pop itself off the field.  What you don't want from this deck is cards that are not crusadia, regardless if going first or second. This will prevent you from doing anything due the the fact your only link 1 requires a crusadia monster, but if you get that sorted your set to go.  (Can also I:P with a Watt in hand for a Wiked combo.)  You can also add Orcust with link and xyz engine for a free negate and anti destruction.(Personally I don't run)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Most of the monsters here can hold their own even if Zombie World isn't present, so you can use your Extra Deck to wreak havoc while you wait for it.</span>  <span><span><em><span>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></em></span>: A <span>Level 3</span> Tuner that also doubles as a hand trap which can be used to prevent the opponent from pulling cards directly from their deck. <span><em>Doomking Balerdroch</em></span>: A <span>Level 8</span> monster that can easily be Special Summoned from the Graveyard by it's own effect, <span>Book Of Life</span>, <span>Call Of The Haunted</span>, or from the deck by <span>Pyramid Turtle's</span> effect. Tribute Summoning isn't recommended, as the other methods are easier and keep your monster's alive. <span>Pyramid Turtle's</span> effect is the most useful method, and this monsters ATK is often worth sacrificing the turtle during your own Battle Phase, especially early on in the duel. Not only is this monster powerful, but it can activate either of it's effect's once per turn when another Zombie on the field activates an effect of it's own. This opens up more opportunities if <span>Zombie World</span> is active, allowing you to either negate an effect, or Banish any monster on the field or in the Graveyard. <span><em><span>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</span></em></span>: A <span>Level 3</span> Tuner that also doubles as a hand trap which can be used to prevent the opponent from moving cards around from their Graveyard.</span> <span><span><em><span>Necroworld Banshee</span></em></span>: While she is on the field, your <span>Zombie World</span> is protected from being destroyed or negated. You can also banish her at any time to immediately activate another <span>Zombie World</span> from your deck or hand.</span> <span><span><em><span>Paladin Of The Cursed Dragon</span></em></span>: This guy lets you Special Summon 1 Zombie monster from your opponent's GY that was destroyed by battle.</span> <span><span><em>Pyramid Turtle</em></span>: This is the most efficient Zombie searcher I'm aware of. Truly an amazing card. Literally every monster in the Main deck can be Special Summoned via it's effect once destroyed. This is an easy way to get quickly get <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon <span>or</span> Doomking Balerdroch</span> onto the field.</span> <span><span><em>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</em></span>. Despite being <span>Level 7</span>, as long as you have a Zombie monster, (which is your entire deck), it can be Tributed using only 1 Tribute. Any Zombie monster this monster destroys can be Special Summoned to your side of the field as soon as it has been sent to the GY.</span> <span><span><em>Scapeghost</em></span>: A good defensive tool if you are being overwhelmed. The maximum amount of<span> Tokens it creates with it's flip effect can be used to perform up to 2</span> <span>Link Summons</span>, or up to 2 <span>Fusion Summons</span>, provided you have a <span>Polymerization <span>ready</span></span>. <span>Scapeghost</span> itself is also a Tuner, and if you flip it yourself and have at least a <span>Level 4</span> monster ready, you can use 2 of the Tokens, <span>Scapeghost,</span> and the <span>Level 4</span> monster to <span>Synchro Summon</span> <span>one of th</span>e most powerful monsters in the deck, <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span>. Doing the same thing but using all 3 of the tokens instead will allow you to <span>Synchro Summon</span> <span>Shiranui Shogunsaga</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Zombie Master</em></span>: By sending 1 monster from your hand to your GY, you can Special Summon any Zombie monster from either GY that is <span>Level 4</span> or lower<span><span>.</span></span> An incredibly easy way to set up an <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> for <strong>Gem-Knight Pearl</strong>, or a <span>Synchro Summon</span> for <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Book Of Life</em></span>: Revives 1 of your monsters from the GY and banishes one of your opponent's monsters from their GY. Essentially a <span>Monster Reborn</span> that can also hinder your opponent.</span> <span><span><span><span><em>Polymerization</em></span>: <span>Used to</span> <span>Fusion Summon Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</span> or <span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</span>. <span><em>Super Polymerization</em></span>: <span>A quick-play version of</span> <span>Polymerization</span> <span>that can't be negated. It uses monsters on either side of the field, meaning you can use your opponents transformed Zombies to summon one of 2 powerful Dragons with manipulative effects. Be mindful that</span> <span>Super Polymerization</span> <span>does not work with materials in the hand the same way normal Polymerization does.</span></span></span></span> <span><span><em>Terraforming</em></span>: Instant access to <span>Zombie World<span>.</span></span></span> <span><span><em><span>Zombie World</span></em></span>: The most important card in the deck, this Field Spell not only transforms all monsters on both fields and GY's into Zombie-types, it also prevents both players from Tribute Summoning any monster that isn't a Zombie. Luckily for you, everything at your disposal is already a Zombie. This card not only hinders your opponent, but it basically turns <span>Paladin Of The Cursed Dragon</span> and <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span> into the apocalypse, stealing monsters from the opponent's GY and turning them against them. <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span> absolutely loves this card and benefits immensely from it.</span> <span><span><em><span>Call Of The Haunted</span></em></span>: Revives 1 monster from your GY.</span> <span><span><em>Dust Tornado</em></span>: Destroys 1 of your opponents Spells/Traps.</span> <span><span><em>Mirror Force</em></span><span><span>:</span></span> Upon declaring an attack, your opponent's attack position monsters are destroyed.</span> <span><span><em>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</em></span>: Negates a single Trap card's activation.</span> <span><span><em><span>Trap Of The Imperial Tomb</span></em></span>: When a Zombie is summoned from your opponent's GY to your field, you can destroy 2 cards on the field. Makes a great combo when either <span>Paladin Of The Cursed Dragon</span>, <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>, or <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon'</span><span>s</span> summoning effect is activated.</span> <span><span><em>Tutan Mask</em></span>: Protects a single Zombie from a Spell or Trap.</span> <span><span><em>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</em></span>: [2 Zombie monsters] By fusing any 2 Zombie monsters, you have a behemoth of a monster that can create clones of the monster it battles. Even though this monster can't destroy monsters by battle, anything it attacks (or is attacked by) has it's ATK reduced to 0, and you spawn a Token gifted with the attacked monsters original ATK and <span>Level</span> (as long as that target has a <span>level</span>). Be mindful that <span>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon <span><span>can be destroyed by battle if the attacking monster</span> <span>overpowers it, but not before creating a token</span></span></span>. After a Token has outlived it's usefulness, it can be used as a Tribute Summon for <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>, <span>Synchro Material</span>, or even Link Materials for <span>Vampire Sucker</span>. <span><em>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</em></span>: Relatively easy to summon, requiring any 2 DARK monsters aside from tokens, <span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</span> gains ATK equal to one of your opponents Special Summoned monsters the turn it is <span>Fusion Summoned</span>. It can also copy the effects of a single <span>Level 5</span> or higher monster that your opponent controls once per turn. This is deadly and can be abused when combined with the Summoning effects of <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>, <span>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</span>, and <span>Vampire Sucker</span>. Lastly, when this monster is destroyed, your opponents loses all of the Special Summoned monsters they have on the field.</span> <span><span><em>Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</em></span>: [1 Tuner + 1 or more non-Tuner monsters] By far the most powerful monster in the entire deck. Starting off with 2400 ATK, it gains an additional 100 ATK for each Zombie on the field and in both GY's. If <span>Zombie World</span> is active and the GY's are packed, this monster's ATK can reach insanely high levels. Not only that, but anytime a Zombie is destroyed by battle, this monster's effect activates and lets you Special Summon ANY Zombie monster from either GY. <span><em>Shiranui Shogunsaga</em></span>: When this card is Special Summoned, you can banish 1 Zombie from your Graveyard to have this card gain ATK equal to the sent monsters ATK for 1 turn. When combined with <span>Zombie World</span>, this could potentially give this monster a grand total of 7500 ATK depending on what you choose. Since it's effect activates upon being Special Summoned, you can use <span>Book Of Life</span> and <span>Call Of The Haunted</span> once it's been sent to the Graveyard to retaliate when your opponent controls a powerful monster.</span> <span><span><em><strong>Gem-Knight Pearl</strong></em></span>: [2 level 4 monsters] A powerful, easy to summon 2600 attacker, only lacking an effect. <span><strong><em>Number 22: Zombiestein</em></strong></span>: 2 Level 8 DARK monsters. You can use any combination of 2 <span>Doomking Balerdroch</span>, <span>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</span>, or <span>Starving Venom Fusion Dragon <span>to <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> this titan.</span></span> Without protection, this monster's effect negation isn't too useful; it's insanely high ATK is what gives it a spot in this deck. If it somehow makes it into the Graveyard, it can be used to give <span>Shiranui Shogunsaga</span> an absurd boost in power. </span><span><span><em><span>Vampire Sucker</span></em></span>: [2 Zombie monsters] This monsters effect might not seem too helpful, but you can create a few combos with it. Once per turn, you can summon any monster from your opponent's GY to their side of the field in DEF position, and turn it into a Zombie (useful for instances when <span>Zombie World</span> is not active). That monster can then be used in one of 2 ways. It can be used as a Tribute for a Tribute summon (<span>Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon</span>) even though you don't control them, it can also be used to create a Token for <span>Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon<span>.</span></span> Further more, summoning the monster let's you draw a card. Of course, her draw effect can be triggered any time a Zombie monster is Special Summoned.</span> <p><span>Feel free to share any ideas/strategies that you think might work better and I'll look into them. ~~~Special thanks to YGOPRODECK user ""Ashvenfall"" for reminding me that <span>Super Polymerization</span> is a thing and introducing me to <span>Doomking Balerdroch</span>. I have tested these cards and they have increased the efficiency of the deck by a considerable amount.~~~</span></p>"

Of the other four, <a data-name=""Aromage Rosemary"">Rosemary</a> works to put monsters in defense, <a data-name=""Aromage Canaga"">Canaga</a> bounces spells, <a data-name=""Aromage Majoram"">Majoram</a> banishes form the GY and <a data-name=""Aromage Bergamot"">Bergamot</a> is basically the main deck boss. The women also have ED versions of themselves, enhanced by Angelina's power. <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Jasmine</a>'s is a better playmaker that works for all Plant Decks, <a data-name=""Aromaserapy Rosemary"">Rosemary</a>'s buffs the ATK of your board and negates effects and <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Majoram"">Majoram</a>'s searches some importaint Traps.  The traps in question are <a data-name=""Humid Winds"">Humid Winds</a>, <a data-name=""Dried Winds"">Dried Winds</a> and <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>. Of course I only run the former and latter. Humid lets you search a mage, and Blessed serves as a way to get LP or summon an Aroma monster form the GY.  The spells are also pretty important. <a data-name=""Aroma Garden"">Aroma Garden</a> being a field that grants consistent LP and an atk buff to go with Rosemary's, and <a data-name=""Aroma Gardening"">Aroma Garden<em>ing</em></a> does the same but also lets you get a monster form the deck if you happen to be losing.  Off theme support includes <a data-name=""Spore"">Spore</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Princess"">Rose Princess</a>, <a data-name=""White Rose Cloister"">White Rose Cloister</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Fairy"">Rose Fairy</a>, and <a data-name=""Staysailor Romarin"">Staysailor Romarin</a>. I also run <a data-name=""Gingerbread House"">Gingerbread House</a> as a tech for more LP and possible popping of their monsters or making Rosemary's negate a quick effect, <a data-name=""Juragedo"">Juragedo</a> as a free body that also gets LP and <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> and <a data-name=""Super Solar Nutrient"">Super Solar Nutrient</a> for more summoning form the deck.  The Extra Deck, besides the Aromaseraphy monsters, also has the game-breaking <span><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></span>, as well as <span><a data-name=""Desert Locusts"">Desert Locusts</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Ancient Sacred Wyvern"">Ancient Sacred Wyvern</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""FA Dawn Dragster"">Dawn Dragster</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a></span>, and...that's about it  For the side I actually have 4 open slots so Efect Veiler and Twin Twisters are placeholders. The actual side deck has<a data-name=""Red Resonator""> Red Resonator</a>, <a data-name=""Ghost Sister and Spooky Dogwood"">Ghost Sister and Spooky Dogwood</a>, <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a>, <a data-name=""Rose Lover"">Rose Lover</a> and a 3rd copy of Gardening and Blessed Winds.  This is my Aromage deck, as per usual I appreciate some feedback (though I will preface this by saying that I will eventually acquire Dried Winds.)"
