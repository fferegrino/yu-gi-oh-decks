Firstly, before we start, you should know what kind of deck Sylvans are and what to expect.  Sylvans aim to excavate (also mill) their monsters, all of their monsters have an effect when they're excavated (for simplicity, whenever I mention 'excavating' hereon, that'll also mean milling, unless otherwise stated). Since each of their monsters has an effect of when they're excavated, their monsters also have effects that allow you to excavate, making getting started on your combos from just a single card that much easier. They aim to control their deck, you should think of your main deck as your second hand, as you mostly know the placement of each of the cards on top of your deck, so you can do a controlled mill in order to get where you want to faster and more efficiently.  Without further ado, though, let's get started on the deck list:  <span><strong>Monsters:</strong></span>  <b>(Note: There will be a number beside each monster's description, that is their level)</b>  <b>Sylvan Snapdrassinagon</b> - Snapdrassinagon is basically an extender for milling, as when he's sent to the GY (from deck, hand, or field) you can excavate the top of your deck. He's great for thinning out your deck when you need to, but he can be a bit of a garnet. He's only at 1 in this deck because he's not all that needed, but he can turn things around if you excavate a spell (more on that later). <b>[1]</b>  <strong>Rose Lover </strong>- Shouldn't be a surprise, Rose Lover is a great addition to pretty much any plant deck, as when she's in the GY you can banish her to special summon 1 plant from your hand, makes getting your plays off that much easier. <strong>[1]</strong>  <b>Sylvan Cherubsprout</b> - Cherub is the main target for Peaskeeper to be special summoned, since he's also a level 1 and when special summoned, you can choose to excavate 1 or 2 cards. His second effect is also decent, letting you special summon 1 level 1 plant-type monster from your deck (once per turn), making going into rank 1 XYZ monsters that much easier. <b>[1]</b>  <b>Sylvan Princessprout</b> - Arguably one of the more important cards, since both of her effects are really good. You can tribute her, excavate, and then place 1 'Sprout' (meaning only her and Cherubsprout) from your GY to the top of your deck. Her second effect basically just makes it easier to go into XYZ monsters, as when she's excavated you can special summon her and change her level from 1-8. <b>[1]</b>  <b>Sylvan Marshalleaf</b> - Marshalleaf allows you to excavate 1 or 2 cards when you normal summon him, making him a good starter. When he's sent to the GY, you can target 1 monster on the field and destroy it (not once per turn). <b>[3]</b>  <strong>Lonefire Blossom </strong>- Lonefire is a great starter or extender, you can tribute 1 plant monster (which will be himself 99% of the time) to special summon 1 plant monster from your deck. <strong>[3]</strong>  <strong>Flowerbot</strong> - Flowerbot has the effect of when he's sent to the GY, you can draw 1 card and then place 1 card from your hand on the top of your deck, so not only can you get rid of any potential garnets, but you can use him to know what you're going to draw.<strong> [3]</strong>  <strong>Staysailor Romarin</strong> - Romarin is an all-around versatile card that I couldn't recommend enough, since she has 2 good effects that allow you to pop-off. (Quick-effect) You can target 1 face-up plant monster you control and send 1 other plant-type monster to the GY to make sure it can't be destroyed by either battle or card effect once per turn. Her second effect is mostly what you'll use her for though, as when she's sent to the GY, you can send 1 other level 5 or lower plant monster from either your extra deck or main deck to the GY. <strong>[4]</strong>  <b>Sylvan Bladefender</b> - Bladefender is a decent card for the most part, mostly because when he's sent to the GY via excavating, you can add him to your hand. His first effect says if he destroys a monster by battle, you can excavate the top of your deck, but I don't know how often you'd be able to pull this off. <b>[4]</b>  <b>Sylvan Flowerknight</b> - Not much to say about Flowerknight other than he's a decent card, when he's normal summoned you can excavate the top card of your deck. You'll mostly want him for his 2nd effect, though, as when he's sent from deck to the GY, you can place choose to place 1 Sylvan card on the top of your deck. <b>[4]</b>  <b>Sylvan Guardioak</b> - Guardioak is an alright card and relies less on variables like Lotuswain (a level 5 that excavates based on how many cards your opponent controls) does. Once per turn you can excavate 1-3 cards from the top of your deck, and if he's sent to the GY by excavation, you can choose 1 card from your GY and place it on top of the deck. <b>[6]</b>  <b>Sylvan Sagequoia</b> - Sagequoia makes it easy to go into rank 7s, as he special summons himself from the hand when a Sylvan monster is sent to the GY, and (once per turn) you can excavate the top of your deck. He's also useful for retrieving your Sylvan spells/traps, as when he's sent to the GY from the deck, you can add 1 Sylvan spell or trap (from your GY) to your hand.<b> [7]</b>  <b>Sylvan Hermitree</b> - Although you probably won't have him on the field for long (mostly because you'll want to make rank 8s with him), when he is on the field you can excavate the top of your deck AND draw 1 card, making him a prime target for special summoning from the GY (more on that later). When he's sent to the GY you can look at the top 3 of your deck and change the order, making him useful for a controlled mill. <b>[8]</b>  <strong>Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy</strong> - Snowdrop is an amazing card for this deck, you can tribute 1 plant monster to special summon herself and another plant-type monster, making it good to get 2 bodies on field. You can also target 1 plant-type monster you control and all other plants you control become that level (so if you special summon her and a level 3, you can then use her effect to make the other card also become level 8). <strong>[8]</strong>  <strong><span>Spells:</span></strong>  <b>Mount Sylvania</b> - It's the only field-spell of the archetype, and it's a decent on at that. You can send 1 plant-type monster from your hand or (face-up) field to the GY and then place 1 Sylvan card from your deck on the top. During your opponent's end phase you can excavate the top card of your deck, making it useful to get in something like a Marshalleaf to pop a card.  <b>Sylvan Charity</b> - Sylvan Charity is a card you'll pretty much always want to run 3 of, because it's that good. You draw 3 cards, then if you have a Sylvan card in your hand (which you most likely will), reveal 2 cards (including 1 Sylvan card), then place those cards on top of the deck in any order. If you don't have a Sylvan card in-hand even after drawing, you place your entire hand onto the top of the deck in any order. This card makes it easy to get rid of any potential garnets and control your milling even more, while letting you get card advantage.  <strong>One for One </strong>- Hard not to put this in the deck, you can send 1 monster from your hand to the GY to special summon a level 1 from your deck, pretty much a must-have.  <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> - You can swap this out for something else, but you can just think of it as an extender, but <strong>do not</strong> use this to mill a card that's meant to be excavated first (ex: if you use Foolish Burial on Cherubsprout, his effect won't go off, since he needs to be excavated first).  <strong>Pot of Avarice - </strong>Avarice is also a must-have in this deck, as you can shuffle 5 monsters from your GY into the deck (which will be extremely easy in this deck) to draw 2 cards.  <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> - You don't really need me to explain this, do you?  <span><strong>Traps:</strong></span>  None, this deck list doesn't use any traps (for reasons explained below)  <b>Sylvan Princessprite</b> - Princessprite is an amazing card, not just because she's easy to bring out most of the time. You can send 1 monster from your hand or field (face-up) to the GY and then special summon a Sylvan from your GY, making getting your plays rolling that much easier, and you don't have to detach a material to activate this effect. You can detach a material from her to excavate the top of your deck, BUT if it's a spell/trap, you can add it to your hand rather than placing it on the bottom or top of your deck. <b>[Rank 1]</b>  <b>Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter</b> - Orea is another really good card for the archetype, as you can send 1 monster from hand or field (face-up) to the GY to look at the top cards of your deck equal to the level of that monster and place them on the top in any order (ex: if you send Guardioak, a level 6, to the GY by this effect, you can look at 6 cards on the top of your deck). You can then detach a material, excavate 1-3 cards, and then return that many number of cards on the field to the hand (this doesn't target). <b>[Rank 7]</b>  <b>Alesei, the Sylvan High Protector</b> - You can declare 1 card name and then excavate the top of your deck, and if it's the card you declared, add it to your hand, otherwise send it to the GY. Very good card since you can almost always control what's on top, and even if you don't, milling is still useful. If a card is sent to the GY by card effect (this includes excavating your own card(s)), you can detach 1 material and then target 1 card on the field, place it on either the top or bottom of the deck. <b>[Rank 8]</b>  <span><strong>Potential Questions:</strong></span>  <strong>Why doesn't your deck list use any traps?</strong>  The deck is based around excavating and getting their monsters in the GY, spells/traps aren't milled and can prevent you from getting off some of your effects, the less you have the better. To make matters worse, Sylvan traps/spells aren't good, at all, so they have a negative impact on the deck.  <strong>The deck has no negation or ways to negate, how does that work?</strong>  It does struggle if you can't get some of your effects off, but for the most part it can play through negation if you have a decent hand (which the deck is made with being very consistent in mind, it just is a house of cards). If you want, you can replace something like 'Foolish Burial' and a 'Guardioak' with 'Dark Ruler no More' or something, Ash Blossom can work but chances are most of your copies will be milled.  <strong>What is the end-goal/end-board of this deck list?</strong>  This deck list is pretty consistent in pumping out monsters on the field (that includes XYZ monsters), it really depends. From what I've played, you'll mostly end on Alsei, Sylvan Princessprite, (possibly) Orea, Draglubion and Number 38. This deck has an insane amount of drawing power so as long as you go uninterrupted or can play through interruptions, you shouldn't have a problem with a decent end board. Feel free to change up the extra deck monsters."

A lot of fun to be had, just don't be a tryhard. I'm experimenting a lot still, and this is just a work-in-progress build, so I'm open for suggestions.  The overall strategy is to banish Necroface as much as possible, abuse shiranui's banish effects, special summon nemeses to keep your deck higher than the opponent's and to get bodies on the field and maybe hit a kaiju to proc Inferno Tempest.

This version still allows me to run Crossouts, still gives me enough space to have Solemns in my side, and allows for the formation of a large Apollousa on the first turn via various hijinks brought about by Epigonen. I might want to mix this up a bit but I am partial to builds since it allows ABC to do what it did previously even better without making the strategy too bloated as might occur by relying more on summoning Anaconda and fusing via that card.

I say amaze because I never expected to ever see them topped at high level competition after Arc-V ended with a whimpering goatsee; but I also said disappointment because now you have more normies scrambling around and trying to turn them into the next Pendulum Magicians, but with worse results. That being said I prefer <a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a> over <a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a> for D/D/D. Why is that? Simply because it is easier to maneuver; it's easier to handle without having to take a valuable resource from your deck; and overall, it's just much more accessable to anyone despite halving your LP after the effect is used.  Now besides this hot take provided by a certain professional player who's top 8 is indeed earned at YCS Las-Vegas being out of the way, D/D/D has changed significantly since the release of the set ""Battles of Chaos"". In this set, we got cards like <a data-name=""D/D Gryphon"">D/D Gryphon</a>, <a data-name=""D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex"">D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</a>, and <a data-name=""D/D/D Headhunt"">D/D/D Headhunt</a>; all of these which do in fact change up the game for this archetype to boost up their playability significantly. Another known thing about them is that they do an excellent job at being efficient with board building and making comebacks when being wiped from the field, which did happened in previous recurrences with Arc-V's version of D/D/D; but not as good as what we have now. Let's also not forget that this deck can play handtraps off the deep end, and dare I say it that it can Gamma the heck out of Nibiru; but I would've chose to play <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> if it were to meant cutting out a piece like <a data-name=""D/D/D Oracle King d'arc"">D/D/D Oracle King d'arc</a>, and/or a copy of <a data-name=""D/D/D Wave High King Caesar"">D/D/D Wave High King Caesar</a>.  The spells/traps are in usual D/D/D fashion with just the ones from the newest Yu-Gi-Oh set added, and <a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a>. As for the side deck, Psy-Frame package is initiated because heaven forbid you don't get to go first or go get to pull a <a data-name=""D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried"">D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried </a>on turn one (or at any time for that matter) to stop the Adventurer engine from perfoming any field commotion whatsoever. <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> are your go to side deck choices (as they were for the last few formats all thanks to Swordsoul and Adventurer players). <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> is another piece that was added in case <a data-name=""Piri Reis Map"">Piri Reis Map</a> became irrelevant due to your opponent playing decks also brigading you with Hand Traps/Monster Effects played on your turn. The two Dark contract cards (<a data-name=""Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness"">Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness</a>, and <a data-name=""Dark Contract with Errors"">Dark Contract with Errors</a>) are both played in different situations depending on the deck your going up against; but I happened to use the first one mentioned more often simply because I didn't face Eldlich in the test duels I had to deal with. Finally comes the cardsRed Reboot and Called by the Grave: where they have slowly fell out of favour of being main deck staples, and have quietly became side deck staples out of their own leisure."

Opening with Aleister or Fallen of Albaz gets some crazy potential special summoning for the following turn which also gives big monsters on board. Fallen of Albaz can act as it's own Super Poly which can clear problem monsters. This is built around playing with friends who aren't the most meta players and love to not use any hand traps during play"

I added some Critias card support because he can come in clutch to clear the board if you get into some trouble waiting for Chaos Form or get caught out. It's a very high risk/ High reward deck (I would add Bingo. Machine. Go!! and another Chaos Dragon but they're expensive and I wanted to keep this below 50 quid). The side deck also has Lair of Darkness with Ahrima if you want to be weird and go for the Starving Venom Fusion/ Super Poly disruption."

Your game plan is to break any board and otk with a combination of Accesscode talker, one of your synchros, and Light dragon. If you can open with your field spell before you have to summon to search for it you have access to a draw 3 that will basically guarantee a victory. You could always fit more handtraps in but truth be told these are all I had, lowering the copies of cynet mining or Doyon would be okay if you wanted more disruption but theyre still vital so don't completely cut them.  You use A.I land to cycle through special summoning all your @Ignisters to load up the grave for Dark Templar. When Dark Templar hits the field you want to special summon one of three cards, Bururu, Pikari, or Doyon to the one of DT's link arrows and then summon the remaining 2 with his effect. This gives you access to synchro with Bururu who will also revive the other monster used to summon the synchro which will be a level 4 and if you have the other level 4 or Pikari on the field (Pikari can turn any @Ignister into a level 4) you can then xyz summon Light dragon. This gives you nearly Lethal but best case scenario you have a way to get a final monster on the board with your 3 revival spells or if you opened the field spell your normal summon, which lets you get a accesscode talker with 5300 attack. The Synchro your summon depends on what you are up against. If your opponent has backrow you need to pop you go into Pegasus, If you need to bounce a monster (even your kaiju back to your hand) you go into quantum dragon. Quantum is usually the best choice because of his effect and slightly higher attack. @Ignisters can also play with a pretty bad opening hand as long as they open at least 1 @Ignister and a revival spell (or achichi/Pikari for a search). The play is to open with an Ignister (preferably with the field spell so you can save your normal summon). Go into Infant, and then revive the Ignister you used to go into splash mage. Splash mage will allow you to revive that same Ignister to go into transcode talker (remember transcode can only be used if you have only used cyberse monsters this turn so no kaiju if you want to do this combo.). Transcode talker revive splash mage (or anyone) and then you can make accesscode talker with 5300 attack and 3 destructions."

Using Reprodocus will turn the ghostrick into a winged beast monster so that the bird sanctuary card can be attached to it and rank to the win condition of the deck. Being Lyrilusc these will be able to defend well either turn one or turn two being versatile to surprise the opponent.

Whether it's resorting to Scythe Lock Turbo or playing Megalith or both. This is a really good thing. I always loved Drytron as a Deck, it's a cool concept and has lots of potential; only to be disappointed by how people abused it to make Ultimateness 4 Negates Turbo every single game. I was surprised and sad when I realized that Drytron boss monster is actually a ""balanced"" disco ball that says NO to everything your opponent do, and all it takes is a single Drytron monster to Ritual Summon it. Now I can finally see Drytron as a real Combo Deck that abuses generic Boss Monsters (like every Combo Deck does). So anyway, enough with this dilly-dally, now here's the Explanation of the Deck <h2>Combo</h2> Drytron is a very versatile Deck, so your Combo really depends on your opening hand. But here's a 2 card Combo anyways (Nova + Zeta hand): <ol>  	<li>Activate Nova -&gt; Summon Alpha -&gt; Link Alpha into Linkuriboh</li>  	<li>Activate Alpha in GY Tributing Zeta in hand -&gt; Search Benten</li>  	<li>Zeta Tribute Benten -&gt; Search Meteonis + Diviner</li>  	<li>Overlay into Mu Beta Fafnir -&gt; Send Gamma</li>  	<li>Normal Diviner -&gt; Send Arc Light -&gt; Search Phul</li>  	<li>Meteonis Ritual Phul -&gt; Phul add back Benten</li>  	<li>Phul Tribute Benten to Special Ophiel -&gt; Search Bethor and Idaten</li>  	<li>Synchro Diviner and Ophiel into Baronne</li>  	<li>Gamma Tribute Idaten -&gt; Special a Drytron from GY</li>  	<li>Meteonis add back to hand -&gt; Link Linkuriboh and 1000 ATK Drytron into Verte</li>  	<li>Ritual Idaten (detach from Mu Beta Fafnir) -&gt; add back Meteonis</li> </ol> Now there are multiple options that you can do: <ul>  	<li>Option 1: Link into 4 material Apollousa (Least optimal)</li>  	<li>Option 2: Overlay Phul and Idaten into Beatrice -&gt; Detach Idaten to Send Snow -&gt; Link Mu Beta Fafnir and a Drytron into Masquerena. (You can Masquerena into Apollousa during your opponent's turn after Snow Summon itself from GY). If you happen to have Natasha in hand or GY, Ritual Summon Natasha first to enable its GY effect next turn</li>  	<li>Option 3: Overlay Phul and Idaten into Beatrice -&gt; Detach Idaten to Send Delta -&gt; Delta Tribute Bethor -&gt; Draw 1 -&gt; Link 2 Drytrons into Masquerena. (You can Masquerena into Apollousa during your opponent's turn after Beatrice Send Snow)</li> </ul> The difference between Option 2 and 3 is that Option 2 guarantees you Snow while Option 3 can get Dropleted, while Option 1 guarantees Apollousa. Also don't forget to Verte effect because I didn't say it in the Combo Lines  There are multiple other Combos Drytron have, but I'm not gonna say it here, figure it out yourself by actually learning the Deck instead of memorizing a spreadsheet <h2>Deck Breakdown</h2> <strong>Main Deck:</strong> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""3x &lt;a data-name=&quot;Drytron Alpha Thuban:&quot;&gt;Drytron Alpha Thuban:&lt;/a&gt;"">3x </a><a data-name=""Drytron Alpha Thuban:"">Drytron Alpha Thuban:</a> Best Drytron monster; prioritize Searching Benten and Natasha (if you already have Benten), Megalith comes after, and Draconids comes last</li>  	<li><a data-name=""3x &lt;a data-name=&quot;Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:&quot;&gt;Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:&lt;/a&gt;"">3x </a><a data-name=""Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:"">Drytron Zeta Aldhibah:</a> Searches only 1 thing, Meteonis Drytron</li>  	<li><a data-name=""2x &lt;a data-name=&quot;Drytron Gamma Eltanin:&quot;&gt;Drytron Gamma Eltanin:&lt;/a&gt;"">2x </a><a data-name=""Drytron Gamma Eltanin:"">Drytron Gamma Eltanin:</a> Revive Drytron from GY, very important for Link plays.

But can play through disruptions pretty nicely, thanks to its consistency and Extenders. The consistency of the Deck is very high, like seriously. 10 non-Ritual Drytron monsters with 3 RotA and 3 Nova that Special a Drytron from Deck, and even Nova is Searchable with Fafnir. You also have Foolish which searches any Drytron. The Rituals are easily Searchable with Alpha, Zeta, Diviner, and Prep  Maintaining card advantage is also what Drytron's good at. After that 2 card Combo that I showed earlier, you still ends with hand neutral, 5 cards in your hand going first. The amount of searches this Deck has is just absurd. And Meteonis is very OP, Ritual from GY, seriously? The Drytron can also activate their effects every turn, like all of them, as long as you have a Drytron/Ritual Monster in hand. Drytron also can make Twin Twister and Droplet almost have no cost due to how it doesn't matter whether the Drytrons are in your hand or GY  One thing about Drytron that gives me the reason to play it is, fun and hard to play (this is subjective). I dunno why but playing Drytron without Ultimateness is very fun, the amount of possibilities of plays you could make is what makes it fun, but is also hard to pilot. Misplays happened very often due to that multiple plays you could make. Sometimes it's just hard to tell on which plays is the best. None of your Combo is as Linear as Pure Swordsoul, it's always unique depending on your opening hand  Drytron may not have the power it used to have, but it's consistency is still unmatched  And as always, this is not the optimal build. This is just how I build the Deck according to my liking. You can play Scythe Lock with Dagda if you wish so, noone will stop you from abusing such broken card. Enjoy it while you can, before Konami touch it"

I have made some small changes that i think can improve it slightly. The strategy is to control the game with traps, which you recycle with Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon. Together with Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon, you also have Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon as your primary boss monster, and since it can also recycle itself, you have a lot of resources, which gives you a strong grind game. Besides Skill Drain, True Light and Dogmatika Punishment, the traps used in the deck are whatever you prefer them to be. A part from Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon, you're extra deck is kind of irrelevant when it comes to onboard presence, which makes the Dogmatika engine fit perfectly into the deck. Combined with cards like Elder Entity N'tss, you can make some cool plays with their graveyard effect. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

The deck has been built around the Legendary Knights though they have been sided due to how well the deck can run without running those bricks. There are multiple engines / packages running in the deck that all contribute to how the Extra Deck can be utilized.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Deck Breakdown:  &nbsp;  Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package: Joker's Knight package with King's, Queen's and Jack's Knight along with Joker's Straight and Imperial Bower. Both Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight during the End Phase can recur back to hand from the graveyard by returning 1 Light Warrior monster from the Graveyard into rge deck. (Any Warrior from main deck can be returned from the graveyard into the deck to meet Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight recurring effect  because they are all Light Warrior's INCLUDING any of the Legendary Knights.)  Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear was recently added to contribute to the Joker's Package AND to also help Search Red-Eyes B. Dragon. (Giltia can also be used as tribute for Five Star Twilight along with Joker's Knight and Jack's Knight and can also be used for a Fusion summon fro Dark Cavalry and/or Red-Eyes Slash Dragon).  &nbsp;  Kuriboh Brothers Package: (Kuriboh Brothers including Kuribabylon with Five Star Twilight, Kuribohrn, Kuribandit, Magikuriboh, Skilled Brown Magician, Multiply, Detonate, and the Flue of Summoning Kuriboh). The Kuriboh's help search each other (Kuribahs' and Kuriboos' effect) along with helping search their own Spells/Traps (Kuribees' effect). Kuribandit, Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriborhn and Magikuriboh can all be brought out from the deck in several ways to assist in the duel  (Both Magikuriboh and Kuriborhn can be searched by Kuriboo's effect and be brought to hand and Kuribah's effect grants a special summon of any monster with 300ATK/200DEF onto the field after it or another Kuriboh monster on the field is destroyed by battle; All Kuriboh monsters in the deck are 300ATK/200DEF including Kuribohrn, Magikuriboh and Skilled Brown Magician). Kuribee's effect helps search any Spell/Trap with Kuriboh in its text (Five Star Twilight, Mulitply, The Flute oF Summoning Kuriboh, and Detonate are all searchable through Kuribee). Skilled Brown Magician serves multiple functions such as supporting the Kuriboh Brothers engine to even fusing with Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl into The Dark Magicians. Can also be used to make a Time Magic Hammer). Kuribandit is a VERY underestimated card. Kuribandit when normal summoned can be used as tribute during the End Phase to search the top 5 cards of the deck and add 1 Spell/Trap to the hand and send the remaining 4 to the graveyard. (Kuribandit works very well with Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight and adds any excavated Spell/Trap to the hand). Any of the DARK Kuribohs can also be used as tribute for Deck Devastation Virus.  &nbsp;  The Magicians, Palladiums, and Timaeus the United Dragon: Both Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are the main Fusion targets of the deck (Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are mainly to be used to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms. Magicians' Souls may just be the easiest way to bring either Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl out of the deck yet Palladium Oracle Mana and Palladium Oracle Mahad both provide another route to bring Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl onto the field. Apprentice Illusion Magician adds another way to search Dark Magician and be added to hand. Magician's Salvation helps bring search and set Eternal Soul onto the field at a faster rate. Magikuriboh can be searched and brought out to either the hand or field through Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriboo, and Kuribah (After battle or effect damage Makgikuriboh's hand effect can be triggered to bring out Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl from either deck or graveyard and can be recycled from graveyard back to hand whenever a face-up Spellcaster you control is destroyed by battle or card effect. Timaeus the United Dragon can be special summoned from the hand by sending any Spell/Trap that mentions ""Dark Magician"" (A vast majority of Spells in the deck mention Dark Magician) is there to help get into any of the the Dragon Knight fusion forms through contact fusion.  &nbsp;  The Red-Eyes Package: As long as Red-Eyes Fusion stays at least at 1 in the TCG the Red-Eyes Package provides a-lot of synergy to this deck. The Black Stone of Legend can be used to summon out Red Eye B. Dragon but most importantly it can be used to push Red-Eyes B. Dragon from the graveyard back into the deck to avoid Red-Eyes Fusion becoming a brick. Red-Eyes Fusion has two targets in the extra deck (Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). If Red-Eyes Fusion is used to make Red-Eyes Slash Dragon ideally it is best to use Joker's Knight as the warrior fusion material because Joker's Knight can then be bounced back from the graveyard into the hand if there are any Light Warrior targets in the graveyard to recur Joker's Knight back to the hand. Red-Eyes Fusion can also be used to bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon (the most abused path in making Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). Any of the Red-Eyes monsters also serve as additional targets for the Magicians to go into Dragon Knight fusion forms in addition to there being more targets for the Claw of Hermos to make a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword.  &nbsp;  Keeper of Dragon Magic: Keeper of Dragon Magic adds any ""Fusion"" normal spell ""or ""Polymerization"" from deck to hand (targets are Red-Eyes Fusion or Fusion Deployment) and helps add ways to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms OR Red-Eyes Slash Dragon or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon AND can help bring back either Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl or Red-Eyes B. Dragon if any of them are in the graveyard as long as one of their fusion forms that lists on of them is in the Extra Deck when Keeper is normal/special summoned. Keeper of Dragon Magic also serves as another fusion material for for any of the Magician dragon fusion forms.  &nbsp;  Draw Power: Dark Magician Circle and Soul Servant serve as the main search/draw power cards of the deck. Even when Dark MAgical CIrcle does not add a card to hand it helps set up a card for the next draw. Soul Servant at Max power can draw 4 cards and helps search nearly all of the cards in the Magicians' package including any of the Spellcasters (with exception to Skilled Brown Magician) inclusively Timaeus The United Dragon.  Eternal Soul also helps thin the deck by searching out ""Dark Magic Attack"" and ""Thousand Knives"".  &nbsp;  The Legendary Dragons Package: Mirror Force, Ring of Destruction, Crush Card Virus and Tyrant Wing are strong disruption cards with a slight exception of Tyrant Wing. These Trap cards all serve a double purpose in helping disrupt through their Trap Card activation OR by going into they Dragon Fusion forms being Mirror Force Dragon, Destruction Dragon, Doom Virus Dragon and Tyrant Dragon by using The Fang of Critias. The Claw of Hermos serves like an equip spell toolbox depending on what Type of monster is used to make either Goddess Bow, Time Magic Hammer, Rocket Hermos Cannon, or Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword. The Eye of Timaeus helps The Magicians' Package in going into a Dragon Knight fusion form AND also increases Spell card targets for Timaeus the United Dragon to be special summoned.  &nbsp;  Fusion Deployment: Very simple yet very powerful card for any deck that focuses solely on a Fusion based extra deck. Fusion Deployment can be used to special summon Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl or Red-Eyes B. Dragon from the hand or deck since there are various targets in the Extra Deck that list them as fusion material.  &nbsp;  Harpie's Feather Duster: The cream of the crop of staples. Destroys all spells and traps your opponent controls.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Side deck can easily be any other cards though I find that Spiritual Swords of Revealing Light, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning and surprisingly Berserker Soul can also be main decked without them diluting much of the synergy already going on in the main deck.  &nbsp;  Thank you for the the interest! Please feel free to leave feedback!"

That's incorrect.","As Brave Engine Prank Kids takes the stage, Prankers may feel like without the abused engine, you could not prank anymore. That's incorrect.  Don't get me wrong, the new set of cards baits the majority of hand traps which pretty much kill this deck, but who in the world would want to pay 500+ dollars for 9 cards that may be banned in 5 months.  I've tried countless variations of the deck, trying cheap versions but this one looks the more solid to me.  MAIN DECK  Let's start with the latest arrive: DPE. The card speaks for itself, it's broken as hell and even if you end up with a terrible board because of ash blossom, your fusion destiny is almost guaranteed to resolve and you'll have a reborning 2500/2100 1 card non targetting pop, and you may also special summon a monster and draw 2 because of his OP materials.  Coming to the spicy part, Prank Kids are a one card engine, you want to see at least 1 in your opening and or you'll almost certainly lose the game, so let's do some math. Everyone tends to put every kid at 3 except for rocksies and i agree with them, you dont ever want to banish one card even if you have to if you go with the pranks-line one card combo, so you'll sacrifice one rocksies for that. 3 places are pretty much considered any name (always adding drops or lamps).  That gives you 15 names in 41 totals cards resulting in a 91,22% of drawing at least 1 starting first which is pretty good, given that at 40 the chances increase slightly at 91.9%.  The rest of the cards are a bunch of hand traps and cards that just want to make sure your combo goes off.  For the hand traps you can go whatever you want, i personally dont like impermanence because if you draw it off pranks it's just dead, nibiru is just a godsend with a deck like this that struggles like hell starting second, ash is the best ht in the game in my opinion and ghost belle and meister are extraordinary against DPE(everybody uses him).  For ""extendenders""(with this I mean cards that guarantee you dont lose to mono ash on your first kid meaning a loss) you could increase crossout at 3 but if you draw it off pranks it is just a dead ass card like imp before, and all you want to draw are hand traps.  TDF is great if you are in a bad spot and you get nibirud, because at that point you'll have every butler name in your gy and you'll recycle resources which are crucial for this deck. Poly makes sure you end up with TOAD, goated card that helps you a lot and monster reborn could single single handedly recover the game, instant is another way of dodging ash, you summon weather washer, normal a kid and then go into doodle to chain block the kid in gy.  EXTRA DECK:  I fell like extra deck is standard, you play, sadly, 1 meow most important card of the archetype, 3 dodos(you could cut this to 2 but you often go with a combo that uses 2) 1 bow wow that gets you the butler and card effects invulnerability in your opponents turn, rocket ride can let you make disgusting things such as reborning dodo and bow, weather washer is autowin against control decks because people sleep on his effect, if they dont respond before battle they are gone and the last prank kid extra monster is Rip Roaring, you almost never go into this but against eldlich and control decks he is crucial and will win the game alone.  I just won't talk about Anaconda too much, just enjoy our time with it as long as it's not banned, if you have TDF you can go into verte with bow and a kid, and end up with DPE and butler, disgusting.  Toadally awesome doesn't need explanations.  Unicorn and Accesscode are essential in my opinion, if everything goes as planned in your opponents turn you'll have a board made of at least 2 prank kids, you go into dodo, trigger 2 little ones effect then go into unicorn, access black hole opponent and swing at least 5300: crucial.  SIDE  Side whatever you want and you know it's used a lot at your local tournaments, TCBOO it's insanely strong against certain decks and prank kids dont suffer it at all, i would have recommended 3 skill drains but since you are running dpe and verte its often an impairment.  Hope this helps, i also look forward in any suggestions.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Depending on what you pull at the start can change which strategy you can play though. If you pull a Ze Amin or an Emergency teleport you are almost guaranteed either a Foxy Tune or an Ogre Dance. However  If you pull both you can end you turn with a 3600 atk Amazing Dragon with either a Foxy Tune or an Ogre Dance. In addition Leviair the sea dragon is in place if an Amazing Dragon play isn't as viable as if your E-Tele doesn't play out correctly and you end up losing a key card such as Ze Amin or Sharakusai butv still have access to either 2 level 3 monsters or a Rising Carp as it can special summon back any lv4 or lower monster that is banished  As a support strategy the Mekk-kinights can be used as general strength support or effect if you are able to get out Spectrum Supreme.

I would however consider and probably will change the Shenshen with a Borrelord savage dragon. The side deck could use some more work I am open to your guys's tips and comments. The combos are standard dino combos trying to get out the UCT and Omega to shuffle back misc as you overlay depending on who you are playing against.  A bit on my card choice and strats..  Shenshen is in the deck because he is unexpected in a dino deck but has a great effect locking your opponents GY and allowing you to shuffle back misc. Overtex can save you if Shenshen backfires and also has a great effect for blocking spells/traps, also you can send him to the GY with oviraptor and get a pill to your hand. Playing 3 babys?, yes I personally never found my self using petit for getting a pankratops and don't really see a reason to play him when he is a once per turn eff and baby is not so i prefer the third baby as he combos off great with oviraptor or misc from hand.  There is 3 Scrap raptors because him in hand can also be a huge combo with lost world which you have 4 of in you deck. Scrap golem is here to be used as an extra body for Apollousa and he is the only way to bring out Shenshen. Also I would love to swap x3 Chalice with Ashes but as I said it is kind of a budget deck. I think the rest is pretty standard."

Time was not particularly nice to the card, since the game not only evolved to be faster than it used to be, but also ""<a data-name=""Final Countdown"">Final Countdown</a>"" is limited, meaning we have only one copy to work with. The strategy is therefore stalling with the help of ""<a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a>"", getting ""<a data-name=""Final Countdown"">Final Countdown</a>"" by drawing or searching, and then activating the 20 turn counter.

This deck was conjured from the Abyss by me misreading Researcher.,"Okay, I have something to admit. This is the first deck I have made from scratch and its origin was me misreading Researcher and thinking its effects applied to Megalith cards.  However, I did realize that they synergized incredibly well with each other so I decided to throw all logic and caution to the wind and it went excellently. Then, when I realized that the deck was a weird number in between 40 and 60 I decided to bring it up to 60 cards and decided to use Thunder Dragons because Colossus is a really good card and it is criminally easy to summon. So with that all thrown together, I set this beast loose on the ranked ladder of Master Duel and I started getting really easy wins and only had one game where I actually bricked fully, and even then I probably could have stalled for time but I had obligations and didn't have time to wait. This is what I would consider an almost perfect version, but the versions I played leading up to this still worked just fine.  &nbsp;  So the strat:  Really you are just playing three decks at the same time and they all loosely work together to further each other. I'd say about 70 percent of the starting plays involve Megaliths and summoning Granite and have a Phul on the field. Then you get Researcher and hope you hit a crystal, If you don't I'd recommend going into Leonite in an attempt to hit either Seeker or Friends, Ideally, I'd be playing Signs but I don't have the CP to make them. If you want you can also just save the Phul and researcher to summon a Megalith on your opponent's turn to either disrupt or stall.  You can really just go from there and end up on quite a few good boards and it's highly likely your opponent will just surrender once you start comboing. There are probably quite a few different lines but I haven't played it for nearly long enough to find them out.  Ideal end board:  Probably something like Dragite, Borreload, Access, Titan, and Colossus, possibly Block Dragon. Or you could always just make Draglubion and Numeron swing for the game on the 2nd turn.  &nbsp;  Some questions that you might have:  Q: Should the Deck go 1st or 2nd?  A: Honestly either are good but I'd probably say 1st just to set up a strong board. I've had boards with 2 negates and Colossus in one turn.  Q: How expensive is the deck?  A: The Extra Deck is probably the most expensive part of the deck but a lot of the cards are staples such as Borrel, Unicorn, Accesscode, and Numeron Dragon. The main deck is relatively cheap with 18 SR's and 2 UR's but you can reasonably either pull them all from the secret packs or easily craft them, with Maxx C and Called By being staples.  Q: How does the deck play?  A: It's pretty easy, there are moments where some deeper thinking in certain moments would have been useful but in the end it didn't matter.  Q: How is it against meta?  A: So far the only non meta decks I haven't played against are Eldlich and Phantom Knights, but against all the others it was a pretty easy win.  Q: Longest Winstreak?  A: Discounting times I had to surrender due to other obligations or sudden disconnections, above 10, and still going strong.  Q: Ways to improve?  A: Learn the combos, replace friends with Signs, and replace miscellaneous cards with better versions, other than that my lack of experience in both playing the game and deckbuilding can't think of anything."

No, I'm not playing the gimmicky ""+3 <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a>"" Yacine combo, it just is not as good as having both <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> on board. Also, for now I'll categorize this as just a ""Non-Meta Deck"" but it's no secret that Branded is already the best deck.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>Why not? I love Fusion summoning, I love Fusion summoning more than once per turn more, and I love seeing the look at my opponent's faces as I slap both <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> on board after they Ash my Buster Whelp even more.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck, and their respective alternative options, if any:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a></strong> - <span>You don't need Magicians' Souls for the draw 1-2. You just need it to send Dark Magician to the GY, unless you drew a <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> or an extra copy of <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>, then sure you can pitch them for a draw. Good Ash bait, no real alternatives, except for x3 <a data-name=""Nemeses Corridor"">Nemeses Corridor</a> for a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> if you're playing in the OCG.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"">Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster"">Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> </strong>- <span>Your main Normal Summon. Searches Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman, which in itself is a 1 card Fusion Summon and Synchro Summon during your opponent's turn, and if your grip is blessed enough, could also end in a Buster lock. No alternatives for this build.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a></strong> - <span>Your main fodder for <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>. Can search either <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> or <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a>, for more interruption or recovery, respectively. No alternatives in this build, but you can cut it down to however much you like, although I wouldn't recommend it.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a></strong> - <span>You don't need more than 2 copies of Aluber and Ecclesia outside Despia heavy builds. I'd much rather Special Summon Aluber since Buster Whelp don't trigger upon being Special Summoned. No alternatives, standard ratio.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Destiny HERO - Dasher</a></strong> - <span>YEP DPE. For you OCG players, just change Fusion Destiny to <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a>. More names = more access to DPE, you don't need Fusion Spells other than <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> here anyway.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Yes, a Fusion Spell that uses Fusion Material from the Deck, go cry about it. ""Despia is a scam archetype, don't build it"" btw. Money well spent. No alternatives, standard ratio.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Paradise Branded"">Paradise Branded</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong> - <span>Searches your Aluber, which searches your Branded Fusion, Paradise Branded, or Despia, Theater of the Branded. It's always good to have an archetypal <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a> for any Fusion Deck so no reason not to play this card. No alternatives, standard ratio.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a></strong> - <span>A searchable <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> that recycles your other Branded Spells/Traps from your GY and a searchable <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. That should say more than enough. No alternatives in this build, but you can cut it down or bump it up to however much you like.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong> - <span>Why play one or the other when you can play both?</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1-2 <a data-name=""Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman"">Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</a> &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Buster Dragon"">Buster Dragon</a></strong> - <span>One of your main boss monsters, although technically all of your Extra Deck are boss monsters in their own right but I digress. It's also a floodgate against Dragon decks, or against anything in tandem with Buster Dragon. No alternatives.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x2 <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion the Searing Dragon</a>, &amp; 1 <a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Your main Albaz targets. Albion Fusion summons by banishing materials, Lubellion Fusion summons by recycling materials, and Mirrorjade is a better <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, which we also play one of. No alternatives.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade the Blazing Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Generic Fusion targets in case you brick, for Despia, Albaz, and both, respectively. Could be anything you feel like splashing, like generic Super Polymerization targets, <a data-name=""Mysterion the Dragon Crown"">Mysterion the Dragon Crown</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Cavalry"">Dark Cavalry</a>, or <a data-name=""Dark Paladin"">Dark Paladin</a>, for example.</span></span>  <span><strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus</a></strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> for Albaz. This card also searches either your Fusion Destiny or Branded Fusion. No alternatives.</span></span>  <span>Final thoughts:</span>  <span>This deck is explosive as shit. I tried my best to cut the ratios down to just 40 cards but often I just feel like handicapping myself by playing an apparently ""more consistent 40 card ratio"". Play 60 cards of this pile, it'll probably just work itself out just fine. Splash more cards like <a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a> or <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Naelshaddoll Ariel</a> for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a> for them filthy Drytrons, respectively if you want. Overall, I've been testing Albaz and Despia since their release, finding ways on making them work, and it still feels good to laugh at the deniers and finally overshadowing the was once overhyped Swordsoul and Flundereeze. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

By integrating several different engines this deck has been going through <strong>changes over time with the arrival of new supports</strong>. The most recent were <strong>new Machina cards</strong> which is the main focus of this decklist. But in the future they saw more cards to improve the deck's roof even more like Therions' archetype that basically brings an <strong>omni negate</strong> <a data-name=""Therions' &quot;King&quot; Regulus"">Therions' ""King"" Regulus</a> to all decks that put <strong>Machine monsters in the GY</strong>. Also the Therions' allow you to <strong>loop Omni Negate back to the field</strong> thanks to the archetype's field spell <a data-name=""Therions' Ring, the Colosseum Saucer"">Therions' Ring, the Colosseum Saucer</a> so it will definitely make a big impact on the TCG as it already does on the OCG in decks like <a data-name=""ABC"">ABC</a> and <a data-name=""Sky Striker"">Sky Striker</a> for example. The week I'm posting this decklist was also announced a Fairy-type archetype that interacts with Earth monsters in a very interesting way called <a data-name=""Vernalizer"">Vernalizer</a> and that is definitely another addition to Infinitrack Machina. It's because this deck is <strong>constantly changing</strong> that I see it with gigantic potential to be one of the best decks in the format in the future, I have no doubt if it gets to big tournaments. Speaking specifically of the decklist below, the main additions are: <a data-name=""Machina Unclaspare"">Machina Unclaspare</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a>. The interesting thing about <a data-name=""Machina Unclaspare"">Machina Unclaspare</a> is that it allows you to make moves with only <a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a> that previously could only be done with a <strong>3-card combo</strong>, such as making RANK-9 <a data-name=""Phantom Fortress"">Phantom Fortress</a>, RANK-10 S<a data-name=""uper Dora"">uper Dora</a> at the same time as having <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a> Outstanding to make your opponent think twice before trying to destroy your monsters. The fact that you make this move of <strong>sending a Machina Monster to the GY</strong> and then doing RANK-4 <a data-name=""Gear Gigant X"">Gear Gigant X</a> is also a great <strong>interaction bait</strong> if you have plays behind and the opponent spends hand traps on these cards. Overall <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a> is being used more because it's a forfun version of the deck because I don't think it helps the deck in the grind game in the same way as cards like <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> that I'm not using in this version because I prioritize accessing the new boss monster from Machina archetype. If I were using a more competitive version <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a> would be <a data-name=""Anchor Drill"">Anchor Drill</a> and that way I would go back to using RANK-8 <a data-name=""Dingirsu,"">Dingirsu,</a> in the Extra Deck instead of the second Super Nova. I've been told that this deck is very good if used with more than 40 cards but I particularly like to use as few cards as possible in my decks to fit a <strong>lot of tech cards</strong> even more in this format that if you don't use at least 12 tech cards you will suffer a lot against <strong>Adventurer Token</strong>, <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> and Good Stuff engines like <a data-name=""Rose Dragon"">Rose Dragon</a> engines to make very strong combos with <a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Auroradon"">Auroradon</a> accessing several Synchro Monsters Omni Negate type <a data-name=""Borreload Savage"">Borreload Savage</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and especially the best Synchro Monster in the game: <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>. Not to mention that these moves can access cards like <a data-name=""Fairy Tail Snow"">Fairy Tail Snow</a> or passing with <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> Lock. That's why I only use 1 <a data-name=""Infinitrack Trencher"">Infinitrack Trencher</a> and two <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /////////////////<strong>Main combos</strong>:  <strong>Combo 1: ***Harvester/Heavy Forward /***Metalcruncher</strong>  NS <a data-name=""Harvester"">Harvester</a> and eff Add <a data-name=""Brutal Dozer"">Brutal Dozer</a> Dozer eff tribute to special and eff Special <a data-name=""Trencher"">Trencher</a> (LOCK YOU INTO EARTH MACHINE) RANK-5 <a data-name=""River Stormer"">River Stormer</a> and eff Add <a data-name=""Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> Special Bullet Train LINK-1 <a data-name=""Goliath"">Goliath</a> LINK-2 <a data-name=""Ballista"">Ballista</a> Ballista eff Add <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box</a> and eff Add <a data-name=""Tunneller"">Tunneller</a> Tunneller eff tribute Ballista Special itself LINK-1 Goliath  Trencher eff to Reborn Harvester (TARGET either DOZER or Harvester depends on wats your hand or with wich one you started) LINK-1 Goliath (using Harvester) LINK-2 <a data-name=""Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> Tunneller eff to <a data-name=""Pot of AVARICE"">Pot of AVARICE</a> (3 GOLIATH, Ballista and [Harvester -

""<a data-name=""Machina CITADEL"">Machina CITADEL</a>"" effect to Destroy will <strong>Resolve without effect if the target leave the field before resolution</strong>, because Citadel <strong>checks ATK stats at resolution</strong>. But you <strong>don't need to destroy your monster to resolve the effect</strong> so if your monster isn't destroyed because it's <strong>under the protection</strong> of LINK-1 <a data-name=""Goliath"">Goliath</a> or <a data-name=""Super Dora"">Super Dora</a> for example, your opponent's will still be destroyed.  ""<a data-name=""Machina FORTRESS"">Machina FORTRESS</a>"" 2nd effect its <strong>MANDATORY so it Will ALWAYS be Chain Link 1</strong>, in the case of crash in battle phase <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a> eff in GY will be cl2.  Thanks to <a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a> the deck can <strong>play against floodgates</strong> like <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> because the Fortress when <strong>destroyed by battle you destroy a card that the opponent controls</strong> and the Citadel returns to the field every turn as a 3k ATK body and possible Raigeki Opponent's Field effect. Now if you yourself are using <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and want to take it out of the field you can simply use LINK-2 <a data-name=""Knuckle"">Knuckle</a> eff s<strong>end Skill Drain to GY as Cost to Reborn itself</strong> to Field and start activating Monster effects.  A very <strong>simple OTK</strong> to do with this deck is you use <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Ballista"">Ancient Gear Ballista</a> eff <strong>destroy your spell/trap to make opponent monster ATK/DEF=0</strong> and having access to RANK-10 <a data-name=""Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> you do 2k damage and then do RANK-11 <a data-name=""Juggernaut Liebe"">Juggernaut Liebe</a> and use effect to gain 2k atk and thus attack the monster with 0ATK and inflict 6k damage granting OTK.  The XYZ monster that has the LINK-1 <a data-name=""Goliath"">Goliath</a> as material is <strong>only protected from destruction by card effects while the Goliath is attached as material</strong> so if you detach it to activate the XYZ Monster's effect it will lose protection.  For some reason <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a> is a <strong>DARK monster</strong> so be wary of that detail because you can't Summon it to the field if it's under the restriction of <a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a>. You also cannot shuffle it back to the deck with the <a data-name=""Infinitrack Tunneller"">Infinitrack Tunneller</a> effect.  <strong>Main targets to bring from the deck with Urgent Schedule (the choice depends on the gamestate of the match to know which ones are the most correct):</strong> ***Urgent Schedule = SS Harvester and SS Trencher = LINK-2 Ballista/Knuckle and have Trencher eff Reborn Harvester and eff Add Dozer  Urgent Schedule = SS Harvester and SS Citadel Urgent Schedule = SS Gearframe and SS Bullet Train Urgent Schedule =  SS Gearframe and SS Citadel  <strong>How to make decisions in some combos:</strong>  For example if you can do the Combo: Harvester + Redeployment + Discard ""Machina"" Card (Guaranteed to have Overdrive on the end board) You can decide instead of doing a full combo to just do the <strong>standard 1 Card Combo move</strong> - certainly thought of the opponent's deck expecting a lot of blind second cards post side deck. ***Redeployment discard Metalcruncher for example are already two excellent searches: <a data-name=""Machina Overdrive"">Machina Overdrive</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a>/Citadel so you can decide to play safe. ***Cool of having Fortress + Citadel is you discard Citadel to the GY and already have the interaction setup with the opponent.  It happens a lot that you do <a data-name=""Harvester"">Harvester</a>/<a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a> <strong>Add 2nd</strong> <a data-name=""Brutal Dozer"">Brutal Dozer</a> even though you already have one in your hand thinking about the <strong>Grind Game and the interactions it will take this turn</strong>.  <a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a>/<a data-name=""Harvester"">Harvester</a> 1 Card Combo = You can use <a data-name=""River Stormer"">River Stormer</a> in GY at the end of the Combo to get rid of <a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a> if you have a <strong>full trap version of the deck</strong> and need space in the s/t zone.  Tip: If you draw <a data-name=""Machina Redeployment"">Machina Redeployment</a> with <a data-name=""Tunneller"">Tunneller</a> effect you can use it to add <a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a> and <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a> and discard Citadel to summon Fortress and improve your End Board.  If you only use 1 <a data-name=""Trencher"">Trencher</a> in the deck and discard it to pay <a data-name=""Machiina Redeployment"">Machiina Redeployment</a> cost for example you will have to discard or summon cards like <a data-name=""Harvester"">Harvester</a> from the deck with <a data-name=""Brutal Dozer"">Brutal Dozer</a> and Tribute Harvester to summon the <a data-name=""Tunneller"">Tunneller</a> from hand and make RANK-5 River Stormer to the combo comes out complete.

Detail: One thing that is done a lot in the deck in the case of giving Search from <a data-name=""Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> to the hand with <a data-name=""River Stormer"">River Stormer</a> in <strong>Grind Game</strong> is you do again the LINK-1 <a data-name=""Goliath"">Goliath</a> to trigger <a data-name=""Derricrane"">Derricrane</a> eff Special from Hand and Make RANK-10 <a data-name=""Gustav Max"">Gustav Max</a> and RANK-11 <a data-name=""Juggernaut Liebe"">Juggernaut Liebe</a> for OTK for example.  Interactions involving <a data-name=""Machina Ruinforce"">Machina Ruinforce</a>:  <a data-name=""Bullet Train"">Bullet Train</a> Add <a data-name=""Ruinforce"">Ruinforce</a> = free discard to Special <a data-name=""Machina Fortress"">Machina Fortress</a> in the Grind Game. The same goes for activating <a data-name=""Redeployment"">Redeployment</a> in the Grind Game if you haven't sent Ruinforce to the GY yet you add it to the hand to send with the Fortress.  <strong>Common GY ban cards to summon</strong> Machina Ruinforce: SS Runiforce by banishing <a data-name=""Unclaspare"">Unclaspare</a>, <a data-name=""Gearframe"">Gearframe</a> and <a data-name=""Ancient Gear Box"">Ancient Gear Box.</a>  <strong>Grind Game with Machina Ruinforce:</strong> SS Ruinforce and Opponent's Destroy it and <strong>FLOATING EFF</strong> SS <a data-name=""MachinaFortress"">MachinaFortress</a> and <a data-name=""Unclaspare"">Unclaspare</a> from Banished Zone and Unclaspare eff <strong>Foolish Gearframe</strong>.
