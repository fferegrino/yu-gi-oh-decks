One of this deck's strategies is Ghostrick Dullahan combined with Ghostrick Ghoul.  First, you must swarm your board with Ghostrick monsters the easiest way to do this is through Ghostrick Frost, Lantern, and Mary they can all special summon themselves face down when an opponent declares a direct attack which pairs nicely with the field spells. Once you have a decent enough monster on the field with ghoul and Dullahan all ready first use the Ghouls effect to flip it face down and let Dullahan gain the attack then use one of Dullahan's materials to half the attack of an opponents monster then attack it.  Here is a list of all the cards in it  Main Deck: 1x Ghostrick Stein 2x Ghostrick Mummy 1x Ghostrick Ghoul 3x Ghostrick Jiangshi 2x Ghostrick Witch 1x Ghostrick Fairy 2x Ghostrick Jackfrost 2x Ghostrick Lantern 3x Ghostrick Specter 3x Ghostrick Mary 3x Ghostrick Shot 2x Ghostrick Museum 2x Ghostrick Parade 2x Ghostrick Mansion 2x Ghostrick Vanish 3x Ghostrick Scare 3x Ghostrick-Go-Round 3x Allure of Darkness --------- Extra Deck: 2x Ghostrick Angel of Mischief 3x Ghostrick Alucard 3x Ghostrick Socuteboss 3x Ghostrick Dullahan 3x Ghostrick Festival ---------"

Presenting, Synchro Goodstuff.  ""Why play this deck?""  Well... the Synchro Festival is up, and if you're tired of playing the same shit, and by that I mean Virtual World, here's a more of an old school classic of a strategy, and if you might have noticed, this engine is all gas and nothing but Synchro 8 engines. I will discuss more of the nuances in the list as I go through the individual cards. This list's game plan only revolves around one thing: Synchro Summon <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> and/or bring out <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a> as quick as you can and use them to either aggressively interrupt your opponent at their most crucial choke points or defensively depending on the situation. Anyway, the list.  <strong>The Main Deck, where I will discuss in engines:</strong>  <strong>• The Assault Mode engine</strong> - <span>This is the first half of your strategy, which only has one goal in mind and that is to bring out its archetypal boss monster <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a> as quick as it can. Here's their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</strong></a> - <span>Your first boss monster. Requires a Stardust Dragon to be tributed for its Special Summon but that's hardly a problem for a deck that can turbo out Level 8 Synchros. Has a once per turn omni negation effect, and can bring itself back during the End Phase of the turn it is used.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Psi-Reflector&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Psi-Reflector</strong></a> - <span>Your main starter of the engine and is the Tuner, with a great and versatile level of 1 for any Synchro focused strategy, and both a Search effect to initiate your combos and a Level modulating effect that can be relevant to your needs.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Sentinel&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Sentinel</strong></a> - <span>Your secondary starter of the engine. Brings out Psi-Reflector from the Deck, and has a Type modulating effect that is actually valuable in other strategies, but not on this one since Levels are our only concern.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Beast&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Beast</strong></a> - <span>Your main search target if you didn't open Assault Sentinel to search Assault Mode Activate.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Teleport&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Teleport</strong></a> - <span>Allows you to fix your hand in case you drew your Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, and draws you 2 cards.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Assault Mode Activate&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong></a> - <span>The centerpiece of the Deck, you always want to have at least 1 copy of this card in your hand, and that's why we play 2 of it. It enables your Psi-Reflector's effect and allows you to bring out <strong><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a></strong> during your opponent's turn. Your secondary search target if you opened Assault Sentinel.</span></li> </ol> <strong>• The Ascator engine</strong> - <span>A one card Synchro 8 engine that only consists of two cards, being <a data-name=""Ascator, Dawnwalker"">Ascator, Dawnwalker</a> and <a data-name=""Fire Ant Ascator"">Fire Ant Ascator</a> as his target.</span>  <strong>• The Dragunity engine</strong> - <span>This list actually contains two Dragunity engines. The first one being <a data-name=""Dragunity Dux"">Dragunity Dux</a>, <a data-name=""Dragunity Phalanx"">Dragunity Phalanx</a>, and <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana"">Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana</a>, a more fragile one card combo that requires your Normal Summon with the help of a graveyard setup, usually facilitated by <a data-name=""Cards of Consonance"">Cards of Consonance</a>, and the second newer one consisted of <a data-name=""Dragunity Remus"">Dragunity Remus</a>, <a data-name=""Dragunity Legatus"">Dragunity Legatus</a>, <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg"">Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg</a>, and <a data-name=""Mist Valley Baby Roc"">Mist Valley Baby Roc</a>, both of which can easily bring out <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> under 5 Summons, the only difference is that the latter does not consume your Normal Summon.</span>  <strong>• The Windwitch engine</strong> - <span>This engine is usually used alongside Speedroids, since they are not only synergistic lore-wise but also in game. It xenolocks us from Special Summoning other monsters but WIND attribute monsters, but it doesn't really matter outside of the Assault Mode and the Ascator engine. Here are their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Windwitch - Ice Bell&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Windwitch - Ice Bell</strong></a> - <span>You'd ideally want to start with her since she has an effect that allows herself to be Special Summoned if you control no other monsters.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Windwitch - Glass Bell&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Windwitch - Glass Bell</strong></a> - <span>She has an effect that allows you to search a ""Windwitch"" monster upon her Normal or Special Summon, except a copy of herself.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Windwitch - Snow Bell&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Windwitch - Snow Bell</strong></a> - <span>She has an effect that allows herself to be Special Summoned if you control 2 or more WIND attribute monsters, which we play more than enough of.</span></li> </ol> <strong>• The Staples</strong> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Cards of Consonance&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Cards of Consonance</strong></a> - <span>Provides draw power and GY setup. Not once per turn.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Pot of Avarice&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Pot of Avarice</strong></a> - <span>Provides draw and recycling power which will be helpful on cases where you have opening hands that have a dead Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode and you have no other choice but to use it as a discard fodder for anything.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Monster Reborn&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Monster Reborn</strong></a> - <span>Reborns a monster.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Teleport&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Emergency Teleport</strong></a> - <span>Provides access to the Assault Mode engine without costing your Normal Summon of the turn. Can be activated during the Draw and Standby Phase of your turn, which plays around Droll &amp; Lock Bird.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Ravine&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragon Ravine</strong></a> - <span>Targets for Dragunity Remus, and is an essential component for the Dragunity engine. Provides either GY setup or a search.</span></li> </ol> <strong>The Extra Deck</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a></strong> - <span>It's no coincidence that she got released before the event. If you have a deck that can occasionally bring her out, there's no reason not to. She has a OPT pop effect, once per face up negation effect, and an effect that allows herself to be recycled in order to revive any Level 9 or lower monster in your GY, which would be more often either Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon or a Stardust Dragon.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a></strong> - <span>The boss monster of the deck. Has both a monster negation effect that boosts its own ATK and another ATK boosting effect when it battles any Level 5 or higher monster during the Damage Calculation.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>If you can make it in a Synchro deck, there's no reason not to.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Has a decent negation effect against destruction card effects, but it's only relevant as a target for Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Barcha"">Dragunity Knight - Barcha</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Baronne De Fleur.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a></strong> - <span>Has arguably better negation effects than Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon since it has two instead of just one, but does not have the combat protection through ATK boosting.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Windwitch - Winter Bell"">Windwitch - Winter Bell</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for the Windwitches. Has a burn effect that is always welcome than having nothing else.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg"">Dragunity Knight - Gae Dearg</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for the Dragunities, usually through Dragunity Remus and Dragunity Legatus.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana"">Dragunity Knight - Vajrayana</a></strong> - <span>A stepping stone to make Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon for the Dragunities, usually through Dragunity Dux and Dragunity Phalanx.</span>  Final Thoughts:  I mean... it's Crystal Wing/Assault Mode engine turbo.dek. Sure, some people might say that it's a boring way to play the event but, Crystal Wing is a good boss monster, and so is Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode, and if it does the job right, you know... can you really complain? Gotta get those gems somehow, am I right? As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

The Frog engine is one of the best engines you can use, as it ends on a free Negate through any means of your Gigantic or Elf.  The use of the Adventurer engine is another back bone in the version that is played because it is a Negate before your Gigantic Splight hits the field so you have a little more protection in case of a hand trap."

","Still some bricking, but not as bad as some other decks, and if you can survive a turn you'll usually draw into something to get your combos started  One each of Knight and Brave since I felt like I was bricking too much with more than one of each 2 Vanishers since 3 never felt necessary One wizard because personally I don't summon him too often and when I do, he's my normal summon so I VERY rarely want two in hand Dragon Buster to lock opponents out of the extra deck for however long - swap this with a second Wizard if you'd like but know that it can only be equipped through Union Carrier's effect to other dragons Nebula Dragon - Basically a free rank 8 especially if you don't see a way to get out GEPD or any other level 8  in your hand BUT you should know it locks you into only summoning dragons for the rest of your turn, so make sure you can win that turn or survive if you play this Galaxy Trance - Pretty good for late game as long as you can pay the cost, but I don't really see the need for more than one. Searchable with Wizard's effect 2 Galaxy Expedition - 3 also feels unnecessary 1 Lightning Storm - Just a going second card to bait or even wipe if you can  Extra deck Ahashima - For late game and to basically turn two level 4's into a rank 8 1 Photon Lord - Most decks run 2. You can if you want I just needed room Draglubion and Numeron Dragon - I was playing Nova and Infinity and the two of them are extremely consistent in this deck, I just got bored of it because you can honestly summon them almost every game. That being said I recommend playing one or the other unless you decide to take out maybe Zues and Ahashima."

Esse Deck de 40 estampas é para celebrar a estratégia dos grandes Dragões utilizada por Seto Kaiba na série animada clássica de Yu-Gi-Oh!. O Deck inclui Dragões com Níveis 7 e 8 capazes de banir cartas do oponente quando forem Invocados, ganhando mais pontos de ataque para cada carta banida. Também estão inclusos novos monstros Sincro e XYZ fáceis de Invocar para ajudar seus Dragões rapidamente. A melhor parte é que esse deck funciona com QUALQUER Dragão de Nível 7 ou 8, incluindo os Dragões de outros Decks e coleções.  O verdadeiro trunfo do Deck Temático Renascimento dos Verdadeiros Dragões é um card de Magia que permite a Invocação de qualquer Dragão de Nível 7 ou 8 diretamente do Cemitério sem restrições, além de poder ser utilizada posteriormente para proteger seus Dragões da destruição, sem inconvenientes ou limitações. É um card essencial para todos os Decks de Dragões!

Rather than going for Giant Ballpark or Cocoon of Evolution plays i decided that the most consistent way to play the deck was to focus on getting insects disruption onto the board. I found that Danger's and Sekka's Light made my combos much more consistent allowing me to get at the very least a Seraphim Papillon and a Number 3: Cicada King onto the board with Battlewasp: Sting the Poison and/or Scary Moth in the graveyard or hand as summonable targets on my opponents board.

Tried to make it budget friendly but due to the need for staples and combo extenders it's quite high in the low-end category.  Ideally plays second to respond with cards like dingirsu, rusty bardiche, and dharc; can also play first and interrupt with babel.  This deck plays the dragon link engine to quickly get DARK effect monsters on the field as link or synchro material, the phantom knights' engine as a combo extender / board break when paired with dingirsu - as well as a few negates and searches, and the sky striker engine to build material turn 1. Previous lists included trickstars however they were since removed for causing bricks and wasting a normal summon or the field spell slot.  My favourite matchup is vs. red-eyes, or really any deck with the dragoon engine. If you don't have a kaiju in hand, bait the negate and then go into ding with any 2 effect monsters, sending dragoon to the grave. Then, use ding and one other DARK monster to go into dharc the dark charmer and steal their dragoon from grave. You get a free negate, and your opponent is very sad. Cymbal can also revive ding from your grave next turn if you would like to keep destruction protection on the field.  This deck uses effect veiler as its main handtrap to ensure that chaos ruler will have material to revive itself after destruction, and it's a cheaper alternative to ash blossom while still having some of the upsides and downsides. I run raidan as my kaiju of choice since it is a dark monster, so if necessary I can play it mid-turn while being locked into DARK summons. There's also a gadarla in the side deck if you get statued. While I tend to avoid LP cost cards, I do run a destrudo since it can turbo clear wing, or be used as material for crystron halqifibrax without a normal summon (which can then search a bombard for even more combos). I don't play any ""pot of"" cards in this deck as I have found that banishing cards that are only played at 1-2 copies can significantly slow or even instantly scoop the deck, and I can't play duality because I need my normal summon. There are some other choices I made when building this deck that seem wrong compared to other, but I can't list them all here since it would be a very long paragraph.  If you need any help learning the deck or you would like to contact me, drop a message to hhez#7601  Thanks for taking time to check out my deck, I spent a LOT of time refining this through competitive gameplay and it was rather expensive to do so.

Even with the loss of the VFD Virtual World didn't need much time to fit the best way to play but now it's turned to a more friendly combo where you pass with <strong>solid interactions and a lot of advantage</strong> and follow up in the process. The main features that make Virtual World a unique deck in the game is mainly its way of playing which is a very smart card design and the <strong>restrictions that Archetype itself has</strong> when starting to play on te lock in <strong>Special Summoning only Monsters that have Level/Rank 3 or higher</strong>. This means that after resolving the effects of the Main Deck monsters that activate from the hand, you can only Summon Monsters from the Main Deck of Level 3 or higher, and regarding the Extra Deck you will only have the disposal to make <strong>Synchro Monsters of Level 3 or higher and Rank-3 or higher XYZ monsters</strong>. And since virtually all <strong>Virtual World monsters are Level 3 or Level 6</strong> you will almost always be limited to making <strong>Level 6, 9, and 12 Synchro Monsters and Rank 3, 6, 9, and 12 XYZ</strong> Monsters. , this deck <strong>does not use LINK Monsters to play</strong> even though you can technically Link Summon before activating the Virtual World Monsters effects in 99% of decklists you will not see any LINK monsters being used in the Extra Deck which brings even more credibility to the gameplay of this archetype since there is <strong>no need to use LINK-2 Enabler to play differently from several Metagame decks</strong> that would become 10 times worse than they are without Crystron Halqifibrax, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights, Aromaseraphy Jasmine, Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss among other generic LINK cards that may be banned in the near future. The biggest problem with Virtual World has always been the <strong>issue of Consistency</strong> because when it comes out of inertia this is one of the <strong>most resilient decks in the game</strong> as you work with Archetype card movement in all possible places: <strong>hand effects, field effects , GY effects and even banned cards are relevant</strong>. That's why you dodge many interactions in the form of Hand Trap when playing from Virtual World like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and even high impact Hand Traps like <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> can be won by the simple factor of opening with multiple Virtual World names in hand.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////The <strong>deck's gameplay is based on the 3 types of cards in the game: Monsters, Spells and Traps</strong>. Basically you start your moves by activating the effects of the following <strong>Virtual World Monsters in your hand</strong>: <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a>, <a data-name=""Xiezhi - Jiji"">Xiezhi - Jiji</a>, <a data-name=""Kirin - Lili"">Kirin - Lili</a> and <a data-name=""Roshi - Laolao"">Roshi - Laolao</a> and for that they have a <strong>common requirement of needing to target a Virtual World card on your field</strong> to activate its effects and take an action and Special Summon it from your hand. The action they take is for you to <strong>send a Virtual World card from your Deck to the Graveyard of a different Type than the Virtual World card on the field you targeted</strong> to activate its effect. For example if you target a Monster like <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> you must send a Spell or Trap from Virtual World to the GY for the monster to Special Summon, if it is targeted in a Spell like <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> you send a Monster or Trap and if for a Trap like <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> you send a Monster or a Spell to the GY. These monsters do yet another <strong>action when Special Summoned</strong>: <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a> <strong>adds a Virtual World card from your Deck to your hand</strong> of a <strong>Third Type</strong> different from the card you targeted on the field and the one you sent to the GY , so if you targeted a Monster and sent Spell <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> to the GY for example you can add a Trap to your hand like <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> which makes it the <strong>best card in the Deck</strong> as it gives you access to 2 Potential Virtual names World to continue playing and generate a lot of advantage and game volume in addition to being a <strong>Tuner Monster</strong>. <a data-name=""Xiezhi - Jiji"">Xiezhi - Jiji</a> has the perk effect of <strong>retaining Follow Up in the End Phase</strong> of your turn when adding a Virtual World Monster from your GY to your hand. <a data-name=""Kirin - Lili"">Kirin - Lili</a> can <strong>send a Virtual World card from your Deck to the GY of a Third type</strong> different from the card you targeted on the field and the first one you sent to the GY, so if you targeted a Trap like <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> for example and sent Spell <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> to GY you can add send a Virtual World Monster to GY like <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a>. And finally <a data-name=""Roshi - Laolao"">Roshi - Laolao</a> is the <strong>best Extender of the deck</strong> since in addition to being a <strong>Tuner Monster</strong> it has the additional effect of giving <strong>Monster Reborn from a Virtual World in your GY</strong> in Defense Position (and with the effects negated) which allows you to make <strong>very aggressive plays</strong>. A curiosity about these effects of handheld Virtual World Monsters as well as <strong>Archetype Drytron Monsters</strong> such as <a data-name=""Drytron Alpha Thuban"">Drytron Alpha Thuban</a> for example is that in the resolution of the Special Summon effect you <strong>resolve the additional advantage effect of the card</strong>, that is, at the same time as you Special Summoned <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a> to the field you will <strong>add a Virtual World card to the hand</strong> and that way this deck has great <strong>resilience to cards that negate monster effects on the field</strong> like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> with you being able to even OTK over the effect of Floodgates like Skill Drain because it <strong>doesn't affect your build play</strong>, but rather affects the Extra Deck monsters you bring onto the field only. Usually you always access <a data-name=""Lulu"">Lulu</a> in all Combos whether Turn 1 or Grind Game, <a data-name=""Lili"">Lili</a> is a great Starter also on turn 1 but in the next turns he gets a little weakened since you already have so many Virtual World cards in the GY and banned that its added effect of sending one more Virtual World card to the GY becomes a bit redundant. <a data-name=""Laolao"">Laolao</a> is <strong>not a good Starter</strong> because its additional effect is only relevant when you <strong>already have Virtual World Monsters in your GY</strong> but it is an excellent <strong>Extender and Follow Up</strong> in the deck and finally <a data-name=""Jiji"">Jiji</a> is a good card to have at your disposal throughout the game.  The only Virtual World Monsters in the Main Deck that <strong>do not have a Hand effect</strong> are <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> and <a data-name=""Toutou"">Toutou</a>, as Toutou is little explored in the deck I will focus only on <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> but the basic purpose of the two cards is the same: They are the <strong>main Normal Summons of the deck</strong> since Virtual World does not need to be Normal Summoned to play but even then <strong>you will often not have a Virtual World Spell/Trap to target and activate the effects of hand Virtual Worlds</strong> so you will need to <strong>Normal Summon these cards</strong> to the field to start playing. <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> being a <strong>Level 3 Psychic Monster</strong> can be Special Summoned straight from the Deck with <a data-name=""Emergence Teleport"">Emergence Teleport</a> and that way you have 4 copies of Nyannyan in the deck to increase consistency, plus <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> has a very <strong>good GY effect</strong> to <strong>come back to the field if you Normal or Special Summon a Level 3 Monster</strong>, with the detail of becoming a <strong>Tuner Monster</strong> and that will be <strong>banished when it leaves the field</strong> for a Synchro Summon for example. And finally if that wasn't enough it has an excellent effect when it is banned from you to <strong>target any card in your ban zone (except itself) and shuffle back into the deck</strong>. The detail of this effect is that you <strong>can shuffle Face-Down cards</strong> that you banished with the activation of <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> for example so even if an important card of your deck <strong>mainly the Virtual World Spells/Traps</strong> that are important to keep in circulation in the Deck you can recover for use in the next turn. That way even the <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> Drawback can be mitigated in the Virtual World deck.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////And to complete the excellent Main Deck of <strong>Virtual World we have the Spells/Traps</strong>: starting with the Spells we have the <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> which is an <strong>excellent Starter of the deck</strong> because it simply <strong>place any of the Spell/Trap Virtual World Gate directly from the Deck to the field</strong> being the main move put <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> face-up since targeting Trap is the best type of card to resolve the effects of the hand's Virtual Worlds in addition to <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> being an <strong>interaction by itself in the form of a pop of Face-Up cards on the field</strong> (including your own cards) by giving <strong>2 banished Virtual World Cards Shuffle back to the deck</strong>, but we can also put <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> on the field in some situations if we want to <strong>negate the effect of an opponent's Monster</strong> like <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> and that's enough banish the very <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> you used to place Qinglong face-up. <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> also has <strong>additional effects</strong> according to the number of <strong>""Virtual World Gate"" Card you control</strong> at card resolution highlighting the Bonus effect of your Virtual World monsters gaining <strong>200ATK</strong> and for the effect of <strong>Sending the top 3 cards of your Deck for the GY</strong>. Detail: it is because of the possibility that in the Kauwloon resolution you have 3 ""Virtual World Gate"" face-up Cards on the field that your opponent can give <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> in the Kauwloon effect. All <strong>Virtual World Gate Spells/Traps shine in terms of GY effects</strong> and are essential in building plays: <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> is nothing less than the <strong>Archetype's ROTA</strong> in Spell form because it can <strong>banish itself from GY to add a Monster Virtual World</strong> from the Deck to the hand and at resolution you <strong>must discard a card from the hand</strong>.  <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a>, in addition to being an absurd <strong>interaction card that destroys face-up cards on the field every turn</strong> while <strong>recycling your banished Virtual World cards</strong> back to the Deck, it also has a great <strong>GY effect</strong> from during your Main Phase if you banish yourself to target a <strong>Virtual World Monster and increase or decrease its Level by 3</strong> allowing for excellent <strong>Synchro and XYZ plays</strong>. Finally, just talk about <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a>, which is basically the <strong>Archetype's Monster Reborn</strong>, bringing him with the effects negated and in the resolution, just like <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>, <strong>you have to discard a card from your hand to the GY</strong>. <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a> has a <strong>field effect in the Battle Phase</strong> of changing a monster's battle position but you rarely use it to your advantage since pretty much the only time you activate it on the field is when you brick and you still have to control another ""Virtual World"" Gate"" to activate this effect, that is, uncommon to happen but it is useful to prevent the opponent from doing <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> in Main Phase 2 when putting his <strong>XYZ Monster in Defense Position</strong> for example.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Extra Deck's Virtual World monsters</strong> are divided between <strong>Synchro 6 and 9 and XYZ Rank 3 and 6</strong>. Some of them have the <strong>particularity of having effects that mention Monsters with the SAME Type and Attribute or Monsters with DIFFERENT Types and Attributes</strong> and the Virtual World Monsters are split between <strong>WIND Psychic</strong> and <strong>EARTH Wyrm</strong> so that these effects can take place. Often non-Archetype monsters like Synchro and generic XYZ and Deck-used Hand Traps like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> fall into these requirements for DIFFERENT Types and Attributes. In general the <strong>XYZ RANK-3 are little used</strong> despite having good interaction effects, highlighting the <a data-name=""Shell - Jaja"">Shell - Jaja</a> which is an easy way to make <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> from above as it can protect itself from destruction in battle. RANK-6 <a data-name=""Phoenix - Fanfan"">Phoenix - Fanfan</a> is an excellent card that should definitely be used in Virtual World decks because it has the <strong>effect of banishing a card that the opponent controls and 1 card in his GY</strong> also being double interaction and also has a <strong>great floating effect</strong> when destroyed to <strong>Special Summon 2 ""Virtual World"" Monsters with the SAME Type and Attribute</strong>. <a data-name=""Kyubi - Shenshen"">Kyubi - Shenshen</a> is the Deck's Synchro-9 <strong>Boss Monster and has a Floodgate effect that perfectly matches the Archetype</strong>: <a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a> theme for <strong>any card that would be sent from the field to the GY</strong>. As you have <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> to <strong>shuffle the banished cards back to the deck</strong> you don't mind playing over Shenshen's Floodgate effect different from your opponent who will have a complete nightmare when trying to play this <strong>""Macro Cosmos with legs""</strong> because virtually no <strong>Link Summon decks</strong> can play with Link materials being banished instead of going to the GY, the same goes for <strong>Synchro decks</strong> that need to send monsters from the field to the GY as well, <strong>Pendulum Monsters</strong> are banished instead of going for the face-up Extra Deck, <strong>Eldlich and True Draco</strong> Cards also lose all their value when they leave the field because they are banished, only <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> decks can play a little around Shenshen because <strong>XYZ Material is not considered a card in the field</strong> and are not banned when detaching from Monster XYZ. And to make your opponent worse, it's no use taking Shenshen off the field because he <strong>himself returns to the field on the next turn</strong> without being the one sent to the GY when <strong>banishing 2 Monsters from your GY with DIFFERENT Original Types and Attributes</strong>. Finally we have the Synchro-6 <a data-name=""Beast - Jiujiu"">Beast - Jiujiu</a> which is <strong>another interaction card</strong> with the opponent from the Virtual World deck that <strong>sends any card on the field to the GY when banishing 2 Monsters in your GY with the SAME Original Type and Attribute</strong>, and it still <strong>protects itself from destruction by battle or card effects</strong> while you have 2 or More Monsters in your GY with <strong>SAME Orginal Type and Attribute</strong>, but different names.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////As soon as you <strong>resolve 1 of the Hand Effects of Virtual World Monsters you can make the default end board of the deck</strong> by easy access to <a data-name=""Lulu"">Lulu</a> with <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>. So you don't need a lot of cards to play turn 1, just going along that you'll <strong>need more extend to get over your opponent's interactions</strong>. It's about <strong>maintaining Card Advantage</strong> while you play and knowing <strong>how to manage your resources</strong> because Virtual World is <strong>one of the best Grind Game decks in the game for the ease of recycling all the cards even if banned</strong>, having a constant game volume. I've even come across my opponent using <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> to negate <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a>'s summon and I simply used <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> I had on the field to banish Shenshen and negate any monster on the field and then I used <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> eff when banished to <strong>return Shenshen to Extra Deck</strong>, so it's very simple to keep pressure on the opponent with your Boss Monster coming back every turn.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Basic combos for SYNCHRO FESTIVAL</strong>, I'm sure some of these combos can be done more efficiently because I'm not an expert in this deck leaving it up to you to improve what can be improved. A detail in some combos is that I'm only using <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> in my Master Duel build because I don't want to Craft <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and <a data-name=""Crystal Wing"">Crystal Wing</a> so in these combos I talk about doing <a data-name=""Final Sigma"">Final Sigma</a> instead of <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and what happens is that you <strong>pretty much always make these cards the same way</strong> because even though Ultimaya Tzolkin has no level in the Extra Deck you always make it using a <strong>Level 6 Tuner Monster and a Level 6 non-Tuner</strong> in the Virtual World deck which is the same way to do Final Sigma. The real detail is to remember that you <strong>can't do Ultimaya Tzolkin if Shenshen is on the field</strong> so always do the <strong>Tzolkin first before Shenshen</strong> and that you'll need to <strong>set a Spell/Trap to bring Crystal Wing to the field</strong> and in the combos themselves you have this option because many times you use <a data-name=""Mai-Hime - Lulu"">Mai-Hime - Lulu</a> to add <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> to the hand or <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> so you can first set these cards on the field to trigger eff of <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and then if it is <a data-name=""Kauwloon"">Kauwloon</a> you activate to put <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> face-up but of course you could set a <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> or an <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> to have the same result in cases where you don't have a Virtual World Spell/Trap in hand, so these are the details of using Tzolkin's engine and Crystal Wing on the Virtual World deck.  //////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>LULU COMBOS:</strong>  <strong>COMBO 1: Lulu +

playing Virtual World in Master Duel without <strong>3</strong> <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and without the <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> <strong>package</strong> is playing completely wrong with this deck. This is the <strong>best deck to use Pot of Desires</strong> because you <strong>don't care about any downside of the card</strong> whether it's the <strong>risk of banishing an important card or drawing more copies of Desires</strong> itself so you should maximize this card for the highest possible probability to see it in the starting hand or during the <strong>Draws of Extra Deck monsters</strong> during the standard Deck Combo. And the <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> works like a <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> in this deck because it can always protect you from <strong>taking interactions in the form of a Hand Trap in the first Virtual World effect you resolve in your hand</strong>, in addition to being the best hand trap by itself <strong>high impact in the game</strong> as it not only <strong>negates the monster but also destroys it</strong>, an essential versatility card that should be at 3 on the Master Duel banlist instead of semi-limited.  About <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: If you <strong>already have plays you don't start using Desires</strong>, but first try to play and <strong>access the engine cards so that when you use Desires you don't have the risk of banishing some important combo piece</strong> especially <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a> which is the <strong>only one-off engine card</strong>, but also having access to <a data-name=""Chuche"">Chuche</a> and <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>'s second copy in <strong>circulation makes a difference</strong>. So it's more about you <strong>accessing the Virtual World Spells/Traps before using Desires</strong> because the Virtual World monsters themselves practically never make a difference when banned even in 2 copies because the important thing is to have a copy of them available and not multiples. <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> Interaction: if you have <strong>Nyannyan on the field that came back from the GY</strong> by its own effect <strong>and Desires in hand</strong>, you <strong>first use Desires before Synchro Summoning using Nyannyan</strong> because if you <strong>banish a card that you want to return to the deck</strong> with Desires, that Nyannyan will play that role but if you Synchro Summon first you won't get that chance to recycle the right card back into the deck.  A very important detail that some people forget about using the <a data-name=""Tzolkin"">Tzolkin</a> in the Virtual World deck is that it <strong>conflicts with the Shenshen in the summon condition</strong> because you necessarily need to send the materials for the <a data-name=""Tzolkin"">Tzolkin</a>'s Special Summon to the GY but this is impossible to do happens while you're under the effect of <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> so you can't do Tzolkin if Shenshen is on the field and that's why in plays involving Tzolkin you do Shenshen only towards the end of the Combo.  In very specific situations you can use <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> to <strong>negate your own</strong> <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> if you are going to make a <strong>Synchro move that needs materials to be sent to the GY</strong>. It was <strong>necessary to have a lot of VW monsters</strong> from the GY for turn 3 plays, whether in giving Reborn from <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen</a> or to other cards like <a data-name=""Laolao"">Laolao</a> and <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a>. Returning <a data-name=""Nyannyan"">Nyannyan</a> to the GY with <a data-name=""Shenshen"">Shenshen <strong>eff in Battle Phase</strong></a> proved to be very necessary in the <strong>grind game and many times I want to go to the Battle Phase to return it and then in the M2 I special Lulu or Jiji to trigger Nyan</strong>.  When you <strong>play without Spells/Traps Virtual World as a target</strong> too many times to resolve the second VW effect you <strong>will have to do one of Archetype's Synchro Monsters </strong>and not <a data-name=""Stardust Warrior"">Stardust Warrior</a> etc to continue playing. Always analyze when <strong>your play is stopped on the only VW name you had if there is a way you can try to ensure you have a target on the table as a target for the next turn</strong> because if not you can even stop the opponent with the various hand traps that fit in the deck but will have no play on the return. I learned by playing the Synchro event that in these cases it is <strong>always better to keep a possible target of the VW effects in the safest way possible so as not to fall into situations like drawing a name and not being able to activate it</strong>.  &nbsp;  <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> is Level 2 so you <strong>can only bring it onto the field</strong> with <a data-name=""Emergence Teleport"">Emergence Teleport</a> if you <strong>haven't resolved any Virtual World effects from your hand</strong> this turn. Interactions of <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and a monster in the GY like <a data-name=""Kyubi - Shenshen"">Kyubi - Shenshen</a> activating <strong>effect to return to the field</strong> are quite interesting because you can use <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> as <strong>Chain Link 2 to Shenshen's effect to negate an opponent's monster</strong> while you control no cards on the field.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //<strong>Disregard the Side Deck, these are just examples of cards that can also be used in the deck. And about the Extra Deck I also talk about the main cards needed since this Extra Deck doesn't need all these cards to play Virtual World.</strong>  - The first three cards close the Synchro monsters that I consider useful to use in the Virtual World for the Synchro format and the <a data-name=""Mist Wurm"">Mist Wurm</a> would be an SR version of the <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> since its summon condition is the same, the <a data-name=""XX-Saber Gottoms"">XX-Saber Gottoms</a> is used in a more <strong>fun version of the deck</strong> focused on <strong>Looping it back onto the field</strong> with <a data-name=""Cloudcastel"">Cloudcastel</a> so that it uses its <strong>non-Hard Once Per Turn effect of Tributing itself and discarding a random card from the opponent's hand</strong> and to do this Loop is used a monster called <a data-name=""Beast of the Pharaoh"">Beast of the Pharaoh</a> that <strong>simply returns to the field whenever used as Synchro Material</strong> allowing you to continue making <a data-name=""Cloudcastel"">Cloudcastel</a> and <strong>discarding up to 4 cards from your opponent's hand</strong>, the only problem with this combo is that you have to Hard Draw of the <a data-name=""Beast of the Pharaoh"">Beast of the Pharaoh</a> to be your Normal Summon. <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a> is yet another Level 8 Dragon-type Synchro option to bring to the field with <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> when you set a Spell/Trap on the field.  But my <strong>real Extra Deck that I used to finish the Synchro Festival</strong> did not have all these options that I present to you, it was the following: 2 <a data-name=""Stardust Charge Warrior"">Stardust Charge Warrior</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Coral Dragon"">Coral Dragon</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu"">Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Cloudcastel"">Cloudcastel</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Vermillion Dragon Mech"">Vermillion Dragon Mech</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys"">Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</a>, 1 Virtual World <a data-name=""Kyubi - Shenshen"">Kyubi - Shenshen</a> and 1 <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a>. And between these cards Raptite and Geomathmech Final Sigma I'm only using it because I already had it on my account and you can get <a data-name=""Crocodragon"">Crocodragon</a> by <strong>opening Legacy Pack</strong>. So I built this deck at the end <strong>spending 2 UR which were Shenshen and Jiujiu</strong> and the rest were the <strong>Virtual World main deck SR cards and the extra Deck Level 6 and Level 9 SR monsters</strong> so you don't need to craft <a data-name=""Ultimaya Tzolkin"">Ultimaya Tzolkin</a> and <a data-name=""Crystal Wing"">Crystal Wing</a> to play Virtual World at this event.  - Some <strong>tech card choices for consistency</strong>: <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> and <a data-name=""Metalfoes Fusion"">Metalfoes Fusion</a> have the versatility that it doesn't even matter if you draw Metalfoes Fusion because you discard it by the effects of <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a> and <a data-name=""Xuanwu"">Xuanwu</a> to use the effect to go back to the Deck and <strong>give 1 Draw</strong>, on the other hand, <a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a> is interesting in the deck given the <strong>high number of Level 6 monsters we use</strong>. <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a> is the second best Pot to use in Virtual World but it doesn't even come close to <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> and finally <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> which needs no introduction of how good a consistency card it is.  - <a data-name=""Genex Ally Birdman"">Genex Ally Birdman</a>, <a data-name=""Psychic Tracker"">Psychic Tracker</a> and <a data-name=""Psychic Wheeleder"">Psychic Wheeleder</a> are <strong>Level 3 Extenders options</strong> to use in the deck allowing you to make plays like <a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a> and give you even more targeting options to bring into the field with <a data-name=""Emergence Teleport"">Emergence Teleport</a>. <a data-name=""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> is an Extender option to access <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> in the Virtual World deck because you <strong>target any Level 3 monster you control and for half its LP cost it enters the field as a Level 4 monster</strong> Tuner allowing to make <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> together with a Level 6 monster.  - Finally, we have <strong>floodgates</strong> like <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> that can be used on the deck <strong>without affecting the gameplay too much</strong>, but you should train a lot especially with <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> before you start using it because it has a <strong>certain restriction on the way to do your Combo</strong> while it's activated. The funny thing about using Floodgates in this deck is that you <strong>can turn them off whenever you want</strong> with the <a data-name=""Virtual World Gate - Chuche"">Virtual World Gate - Chuche</a> that can destroy your own cards.  &nbsp;"

Usually ends in 2 quick effect banishes and 1 Omni negate. Your goal is to make aurodon at any cost, then ladder into your shoguns and barrone. It dies to one handtrap but there are ways to mitigate that like crossout.  Card by card time  Main Deck:  Anchor Drill - This deck really needs to open at least one extender to get to halq. This plus any Karakuri tuner, which you run 10 of, is full combo.  Heavy Forward - One more heavy forward and it can bait out ash if your opponent is bad.  Ready and Instant fusion - These are free, non normal summon tuner and earth machine extenders. Gamma oil - You also want to draw this. Later on in the combo it can make big plays and it can set up the combo earlier on.  Ninishi - This card is great whether you draw it or not. This plus any Karakuri is full combo (This includes gamma oil). You can also grab it from your deck to get an extra normal summon. That’s a search with merchant, that gets kumanzan, that gets you an end board with another one or two negates. If you just have a tuner, its still another negate.  Merchant - As stated in Ninishi, this card is a great extra extender. If this is the only usable card you draw, you can end with one draw and a bureibu.  Gama - this card makes bureibu a good interruption and is great for ladder. Also it is a Karakuri tuner  Barrel - This is a Karakuri tuner and its level is useful for laddering.  Bonze - this card is great to summon after you summon barrone. It lets you get two bureibus and a super shogun in addition to the barrone.  Watchdog - this is a level four tuner which can make a shogun with a mecha phantom beast token. Not the best to draw, but it’s only a half brick since its a Karakuri tuner.  Maxx C - You need to play this card. It’s a win button going first or second.  Ash - This card stops maxx c.  Crossout - This stops maxx c, Nibiru, called by the grave, and ash, all of which end your turn.  Called by the Grave - This stops most handtraps.  Nibiru - you play this card because of crossout but it is fine going second.  001 - This is a garnet. Necessary for aurodon combo  Extra Deck:  Burei - This card is exclusively here for laddering into your end board cards, but it is very good at laddering.  Steel Shogun - Great for laddering and okay on an end board.  Super Shogun - Banishing your opponents cards are good. With gama you, it’s a quick effect. Usually you end with 2.  Barrone - This is the card you usually end on with your two Super shoguns. Omni negates are good.  Borreload Savage - This a backup barrone. Still very good. You don’t need both.  Sea Monster of Theses and Cyber Saurus - Cyber saurus isn’t that necessary. It shows up on edge scenarios. You can replace sea monster with the peacock guy if your strapped for sr tokens.  Aurodon - Deck revolves around this card  Needlefiber - Needed for aurodon combo.  Almiraj - can help you make Needlefiber if you only open a tuner and gama oil.  &nbsp;"

The main movement is using the <strong>Evil Twin Links</strong> to draw and destroy opponents cards.  This deck has a super strong first turn, but still has a solid second turn because of the handtraps.  I will keep updating this deck as soon as I find better strategies."

Your hand should hold all the tools you need to get both dragons onto the field and then some, with all the draws, searches, and special summons.  This deck can also go into a normal strategy if there isn't an opportunity to hit, or if both of your Prime Dragons have died.
