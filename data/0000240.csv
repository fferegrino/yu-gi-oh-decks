Some of the usual combos I made were:  1- Pollux/Algeidi + any lvl4 = congrats, you have the most repeated R4 Xyz play of this deck  2- Pollux + Sheratan = Normal summon Pollux, then Sheratan. search for Caduceus, special summon it, search start chart with it. end with an R4 Xyz summon + Almiraj using Sheratan + Draw 1 if summoned a constellar Xyz mosnter with Star chart  3- Algeidi/Pollux/Caduceus + Kaus = normal summon Pollux/Algeidi or special summon Caduceus, then bring Kaus to the field. Activate it twice so you get 2 lvl 5 materials for your Pleiades. With Caduceus you can get Star chart an draw 1.  4- Galaxy soldier + discard material = easy CDI  Use Siat and Sombre for recovery/play-starts and that's pretty much it. Twinkle can be used very easely with 1 constellar in GY to make Pleiades, so dont be shy to search it with the Pollux+Sheratan combo. Didn't use Cradle on most of the matches but when i did, it saved the game."

This time, it's Impcantation Dogmatika, with <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> as its main boss monster (despite having 4 others). I've been having a lot of fun with this deck for a while so I decided to share it with y'all.  <strong>A few questions you might have:</strong>  <span>• ""What's with the messed up Extra Deck?"" - for none other than <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a>, of course! The only thing you'll gonna be using here are the two <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a>, the three Shaddoll Fusion monsters, and <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"">Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</a>. Sure, floodgating your opponent with <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> is nice and all, but there's nothing more fun than having your opponent stare at five gigantic Ritual Monsters under <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> and <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>.</span>  <span>• ""<a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> at the Side?"" - Yeah, it kinda gets redundant with <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>, BUT, you can always fix that post siding.</span>  <strong>Strengths:</strong>  <span>• It's a pretty straightforward deck. All you gotta do is summon a big Ritual monster you wanna use then boost it with <a data-name=""White Exalted of Dogmatika"">White Exalted of Dogmatika</a> upon her Ritual Summon (just make sure you target the correct ones).</span>  <span>• A lot of monsters with innate protection, like <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a>,  <a data-name=""Drytron Meteonis Draconids"">Drytron Meteonis Draconids</a>, and <a data-name=""Archfiend's Awakening"">Archfiend's Awakening</a> and interruptions in the form of <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Vrash"">Cyber Angel Vrash</a>, <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>, and <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a>.</span>  <span>•  It isn't reliant to the Extra Deck to make plays.</span>  <span>• It's fun to play!</span>  <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>  <span>• It can brick. (Unsurprisingly)</span>  <span>• No innate back row removal, except for <a data-name=""Nekroz of Trishula"">Nekroz of Trishula</a>'s effect.</span>  <strong>More tech options: </strong><span>• <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>/<a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> for draw power</span>  <span>• You can substitute some of your beat sticks with more control/stun oriented Ritual monsters like <a data-name=""Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord"">Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord</a> and <a data-name=""Magician of Black Chaos MAX"">Magician of Black Chaos MAX</a>, or an additional removal with <a data-name=""Cerulean Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys"">Cerulean Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys</a>. Just be careful with the potential type overlaps for the purposes of <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>.</span>"

The dinosaur archetype got a new card in the ocg called Uradora of Fate. What that card does is: Pay 1000 lp to target 1 of your monsters and it (until the end of your opponents next turn) gains 1000 attack and when it destroys a monster by battle, reveal the bottom card of your deck to put either on top or on the bottom of your deck, if the card was a dinosaur, dragon, sea serpent, or wyrm monster, draw 1 card and gain 1000 lp for every 1000 attack the card has.  The reason that this card is so broken, is that Ultimate Conductor Tyranno can attack multiple times per turn and can beat over almost anything that it attacks so it will activate the effect multiple times to potentially draw a ton of cards and gain a ton of lp."

Albion the Shrouded, Fallen of Albaz, and the ""Branded"" set of cards allow us to play that archetype, as well as providing most of our fusion monsters and fusion support.  Dogmatika Punishment is great for both destroying things, and putting reanimation targets into the grave.  Dragon Ravine is great for grave filler, and Waking the Dragon's just for fun as much as anything else.  The Dark -- Hex-Sealed Fusion is also great for fusions.  Galactic Spiral Dragon and Nebula Dragon are both decent fillers, while Keeper of the Shrine is there just in case I ever actually have to properly tribute summon something.  Into the extra deck we have: the Branded friends, Albion, Brigrand, and Titaniklad, which work with Fallen of Albaz, have some not-bad abilities, and are beefy enough reanimation targets.  Starving Venom Fusion Dragon is an alternate for the three above, as Dark's a pretty common attribute at my table, and he's not bad either, despite easy requirements.  Starving Venemy Dragon's a pet card, but it's also decent, and weakens opponents over time if they can't get rid of it and/or have a grave-combo-heavy deck.  Beelze and Beelzeus are strictly grave fodder/reanimation targets. Wouldn't be too hard to build into, I just don't care to. Once they're out they're hard to get rid of anyways."

Playing magician pendulum monster and tuning magician lets us go into a halqifibrax combo with one card without using pendulum summons which you can save as a second wave. Harmonizing Magician can summon the other half of a synchro summon or go into a halqifibrax combo. The deck is very consistent being mostly card search effects and plays through most disruption well if you know how to pilot it.

This time splashing the <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> package in a 60-card deck, pretty hefty but surprisingly consistent. My previous Branded Albaz deck list already have more than enough Dragon hate, it won't hurt for us to add even more. Not much significant change(s) in terms of the Branded Albaz ratios, only in the Extra Deck where I've decided to cut some more generic Fusion monsters to test other possible options (I am actually heavily considering <a data-name=""Mysterion the Dragon Crown"">Mysterion the Dragon Crown</a> just because there are a lot of lines that allows you to make it with ease). <span>Also, one thing I forgot mentioning in my previous deck list is that <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> speeds up the deck significantly, not only because it draws you cards (which actually works well by discarding your <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> or <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>) but it also sends <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> from the deck to the GY. You could always cut <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"">Destiny HERO - Dynatag</a> and other Destiny HERO monster to make some space for it.</span>  <strong>Keeping it short and simple:</strong>  <span><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>, and <a data-name=""Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman"">Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</a> is a guaranteed <a data-name=""Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman"">Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</a> with Buster lock during your opponent's turn, either <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> (recommended if you opened <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a>) or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, and an additional 2 interruptions in the form of <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a>, mainly depending on your discards, which are made even better with drawing the ""bricks"" (<a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>, the Destiny HERO monsters, etc.)</span>  <span>Side deck is always debatable, but I still do highly suggest Kaijus and outs that immediately address the board (<a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, etc.) than hand traps and floodgates.</span>  <span><b>Note:</b> </span><span>I really tried making it as compact as possible, but 47-50 cards is the lowest I could get it to work without sacrificing consistency and options.</span>"

I mostly play Fusion decks and I've decided to share my Branded Albaz deck list. I've been play testing and building this deck since it first got released in Dawn of Majesty, from splashing it with Darklords to making it work with Valkyries with <a data-name=""Condemned Witch"">Condemned Witch</a>, and I think this is by far the best iteration of the deck that I've been building.  <strong><span>A few questions you might have:</span></strong>  <span>• ""Why run <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>?"" - I'm actually surprised as to why not a lot of people run this card, considering the fact that it helps you dodge targeting effects like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> and <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>.</span>  <span>• ""Why run 3 <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> unlike most lists?"" - It's a searchable Solemn Warning that also helps you recur your ""Branded"" Spells/Traps from your GY, which are either <a data-name=""Screams of the Branded"">Screams of the Branded</a> or <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> as your main targets. A recyclable and searchable Super Polymerization is always great for a Fusion deck.</span>  <span>• ""4 Destiny HERO monsters and a Dark Magician?"" - Unlike most Fusion decks that run DPE/Dragoon, these five monsters aren't really bricks, since all of them are DARK monsters, and there are hands that you'd be glad that you've drawn at least 1 Destiny HERO monster and/or Dark Magician, since there are combo lines that allows you to bring out both two of either Dragoon, DPE, and/or a Dynatag boosted Dystopia.</span>  <span>• ""No Prosperity/Handtraps/Crossout?"" - Maybe it's just me, but I don't think running Prosperity in a deck with an already tight enough Extra Deck space is a good idea. If you feel like doing it, sure. It just isn't my cup of tea. If you wanna run hand traps, I suggest only those with LIGHT/DARK Attributes, for obvious reasons but then, you'd much rather run Kaijus of said Attributes/<a data-name=""Santa Claws"">Santa Claws<span data-darkreader-inline-color=""""> and cards that immediately address threats than trying to generate card advantage (which this deck already doesn't have much problem doing anyway).</span></a><a data-name=""Santa Claws""> </a></span>  <span><strong>Strengths:</strong></span>  <span>• It's a bit toolbox-y (as per most Fusion decks nowadays), but variety and flexibility is always a welcome trait especially for Fusion decks.</span>  <span>• It breaks monster heavy boards with ease, and with the addition of <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus</a>, breaking an entire Dragon Link board has never been easier.</span>  <span>• Much like other meta Fusion decks in the past, it can grind just as hard as them. It's a resource focused deck, and even with the help of <a data-name=""Lubellion, the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion, the Searing Dragon</a>, you'd still wanna be cautious.</span>  <span>• Can easily play around Droll &amp; Lock bird and most hand traps, and despite being able to swarm easily, getting hit by a Nibiru isn't really as punishing.</span>  <span><strong>Weaknesses: </strong><span>• Does not have an innate answer to back row, although that's what your side deck is for.</span><strong> </strong></span>  <span>• It does brick at certain occasions, though it can easily be remedied by having at least 1 LIGHT/DARK monster in either field, usually.</span>  <span>• Mirror matches can be <strong>REALLY</strong> tough and grindy so as per usual, be mindful of your resources.</span>  <span>• Floodgates, as per usual.</span>  <span><strong>Some other neat Fusion monster/Fusion engine choices for your choosing: <span>•</span></strong><span> You can never go wrong with Invoked in any Fusion strategy.</span></span>  <span>• A <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> engine with ratios of your liking. <a data-name=""Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman"">Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</a> is a crazy card.</span>  <span>• If you're not a fan of <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>, you could always substitute it with either a <a data-name=""Light Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a> or <a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a> for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>.</span>  <span>• <a data-name=""Dark Cavalry"">Dark Cavalry</a> or <a data-name=""Dark Paladin"">Dark Paladin</a> aren't bad ideas either, considering that you have four Warrior-type monsters (five, if you're also using a <a data-name=""Buster Blader"">Buster Blader</a> engine.) Both are additional negations and are decent beat sticks, one of which pierces.</span>  <span>• More semi-generic Super Polymerization targets like <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a>, <a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Despian Proskenion</a>, <a data-name=""Mysterion the Dragon Crown"">Mysterion the Dragon Crown</a>, etc.</span>  &nbsp;  Closing thoughts:  Invoked Dogmatika and Dragon Link/Dragonmaid are the most fun match ups you can have, and ""Konami pls ban Verte"" <strong>KEKW</strong>"

The deck really lacked consistency and I had to add couple of pot of desires even though I like using the extra deck as a toolbox and I feel like the pot banishes too much of it. The deck just really wasn't consistent when I tested it without the pots. But I feel like the deck maintains more cards in hand than my edge imp variant of the deck, but edge imp engine is maybe a better at recovery due to edge imp scissor. The biggest problem of the deck is probably that it is very weak to disruption. So going second is usually hard against combo and control decks, and going first requires the use use of crossout designators and caleld by the grave. The other problem is that the recovery is quite weak for non-tuner monsters. Red rising dragon can revive tuners etc but you really have to get another serziel to your hand or chaos ruler the chaotic magical dragon to your graveyard to recover from board wipes. Often this is not needed however since the goal is to just go into a mean disruption board. Overall I really like how this turned out. It is fairly consistent and red super nova dragon is just a boss.</span>  https://youtu.be/w1nHL-Ey6Gw"

Because of this we play a lot of two ofs. This are cards we would like to draw, but don't want to see both copies in the first couple of draws. This deck also has some dead hands, not having Radiation isn't that big of problem as dependent on the hand, you can just do a standard Icejade or Ursarctic line. I might increase the Ursarctic field spell to two, cause they has been a issue sometimes."

Yes, you need to draw specifically a starter and an extender, but at least you'll still be able to play through those handtraps with these extender. I'm also using some Sky Striker card as a pseudo called by the grave to dodges handtraps on the activation of Scrap Wyvern or 'Rusty Bardiche'. So the way you do these line is for example: (Scenario) <ol>  	<li>you summon Scrap Recycler and activates it's effect to send a machine monster from your deck to the GY, and let say your opponent ash/imperm your 'Scrap Recycler'. so then you activate Cyberdark Claw searching Cyberdark Realm which then search your additional normal summon Cyberdark Chimera. Then with these 2 you make Scrap Wyvern. With the 'Cyberdark' cards, you will an extender and also a free pop with Scrap Wyvern's effect saving you an important card that normally you got to destroy or if you want to preserve your Scrap Wyvern. and then from there you just go ahead and do the full combo and pray to lord jesus god Cimoooooooo that your opponent doesn't have anymore interaction</li>  	<li>somehow you draw your World Wand/your Machina Citadel alongside Scrap Recycler. These are not considered to be a brick, cuz with Scrap Recycler you will then send your Machina Fortress, which then you can summon by sending either the World Wand/Machina Citadel. and with Machina Citadel in grave, your Scrap Wyvern are basically immune to Ash Blossom cuz you can chainblock it's effect.</li>  	<li>The Girsu line are basically the same as the scrap line, if you draw an extender with girsu, you won't be able to end on an Apoloussa, but you'll at least end on Rusty Bardiche + I:P + 2 Fog Blade + Ding in grave. so it is potentially 5 interruption which is not bad.</li> </ol> Keep in mind, that this build of the deck are not perfect and can still be improved. i just really really hate losing to handtrap that much. oh also, this deck hard loses to spells and traps that interact with your board (example: Lightning Storm and Evenly Match) cuz the end board only deals with monster effect with no spell/trap negation."

This deck was seemingly forgotten about over time and it makes me kind of sad. It has some strong synergy with sanctuary on the sky which can never be understated.

The eldlich stuff goes around the brave token restrictions, so I thought it would be a decent strategy to add into it. Some of the synergies here is if you have phoenix enforcer you can pop an eldland to get more advantage or the equip spell while you control a brave token to get it back. Overall I'm a pretty bad deck builder and a better version of this decklist is definitely out there but this has been pretty good."

""FTK"" more than 9 times out","Add Makyura to your hand with Painful Choice or Pot of Duality (or just draw it), then discard it with Dark World Dealings or Graceful Charity, after that use Painful Choice to thin out the deck (preferably by having another Painful Choice as one of the 5 cards, since the AI seems to always choose Painful Choice when you go with 5 Spell Cards, unless Chicken Game is one of the cards, then the AI seems to choose that instead.)  Also keep a Magical Mallet in hand at all times if you can, so that you can shuffle the Exodia pieces you've likely aquired back into the deck (in case you end up with something that might have you discard an Exodia piece) and draw new cards to likely extend the play unless you get really unlucky. (I am currently testing to swap out one Magical Mallet for a Dark Factory of Mass Production, to render this less of a problem, or to not completely screw you over if the opponent carries an annoying hand trap in their starting hand or something.)  Notes:  I'm not completely sure running 3x Dark World Dealings is the best idea with the discard effect. (Though it is more of a niche ""This could go wrong in very specific situations"" thing and it does help with discarding Makyura the Destructor now that I'm using a RML instead of Armageddon Knight.)  I switched out the Armageddon Knight for Royal Magical Library, as I already have plenty of ways to get Makyura to the graveyard, and RML helps extend plays those few times the ""Heart of the cards"" is not with me, heh.  Im wondering which out of Foolish Burial and Reinforcement of the Army would actually be the most consistent and complimentary. (Probably Foolish Burial considering I went for a RML instead of an Armageddon Knight.)  Also, I'm trying to minimize the amount of Trap cards, while still not rendering Makyuras effect completely moot, and Reckless Greed in this case works really well with Graceful Charity when activated from the hand as a chain, as you'll draw two extra cards before having to discard, which also makes it less likely to have things go kaputt."

Back row traps help for your protection. ","Pretty simple deck mechanic here. Take away opponent's monsters with Kaijus, and use the Yosenjus to get your Kaiju back (Yosenju 1) or beat over it with an extra deck monster. Yosenjus come back to hand after normal summon, so it's a good idea to have back row protection and interruptions. There are a bunch of different cards to use and it's pretty easy to stay on the cheaper side. I have two droplets hence why there are two in there, but you can easily replace those with anything else. You can also interchange the traps (most people wouldn't play SMF, but I like it for the return). Side deck is also very interchangeable of course for whatever the meta is, and I would even have some back row disruptors possibly in there (Harpie's FD, TT, etc)."

In short you lose to every single hand trap in the game.  ***Combo 6. 1: Harvester + (Redeployment + Discard) (RANK-10 Combo ROUTE 2 = SAFE ROUTE) replay?id=813757-35204247 Gamestate: Super Dora(protection Destruction) + Stormer(Follow Up) /in Hand: 2 DRAWS /in GY: Bullet + Stormer + Fortress + Citadel  Combo 7: Redeployment + Discard (OTK Version) replay?id=813757-35202556 Gamestate: Earth Slicer + Fortress/Citadel + Stormer = 8200/8600damage  ***Combo 8: Redeployment + Metalcruncher/Harvester (SAFE ROTA) Gamestate: Knuckle + Overdrive /in Hand: 2 DRAWS /in GY: Stormer + Trencher + Citadel + Fortress + (Dozer + Trencher) Version Harvester + Redeployment = replay?id=813757-35204671  Combo 9: (Redeployment + Discard) + Harvester (ZEUS 4 MATERIALS + 2 Draws) replay?id=813757-35205252 Gamestate: ZEUS(3 materials) + Knuckle + LINK-1 Goliath /in Hand: 2 DRAWS + Dozer /in GY: Bullet Train  Combo 9. 1: (Redeployment + Discard) + Harvester (APOLLOUSA 3 NEGATES + 2 Draws) replay?id=813757-35205692  Combo 10: Harvester + Forward Combo 10: Metalcruncher/Harvester(STARTER) + LV5 ACCESS (Tunneller/Trencher/Forward) = (TURN 1 CITADEL) replay?id=813757-35234231 Gamestate: Stormer(protection from destruction) + Citadel /in Hand: Box + 2 DRAWS /in GY: Harvester  Combo 10. 1: Metalcruncher/Harvester(STARTER) + LV5 ACCESS (Tunneller/Trencher/Forward) = (SEARCH CYCLE READER) Combo 10. 1: Harvester + Trencher (CYCLE READER Combo) replay?id=813757-35234944 Gamestate: Knuckle /In Hand: Dozer + Cycle Reader + 2 DRAWS /in GY: Stormer + Bullet Train + Box  Combo 10. 2: Redeployment + Discard (CYCLE READER Combo) replay?id=813757-35263487 Gamestate: Gear Gigant X + Stormer(protection from destruction) /In Hand: Cycle Reader + 2 DRAWS /in GY: Fortress  Combo 11: Forward/Anchor Drill + Dozer (PLAY UNDER DROLL&amp;LOCK) Gamestate: RANK-9 Slicer (3 Materials including Goliath) + Citadel /in GY: Dozer replay?id=813757-35206212  Combo 12: Urgent Schedule (BLIND SECOND Slicer + Citadel ROTA) Activate Urgent Schedule Special Fortress and Harvester LINK-2 Ballista and eff Add Box and eff Add Trencher discard Box and Trencher summon Fortress Trencher eff Reborn Harvester Harvester eff Add Dozer RANK-9 Slicer Dozer eff tribute Ballista and eff Special Tunneller from Deck (LOCK YOU INTO EARTH MACHINE)  ***RANK-5 Stormer and eff SEND Citadel LINK-1 Goliath ***RANK-9 Slicer eff detach 2 to pop 2 cards INCLUDING GOLIATH Citadel eff cl1 Goliath eff cl2 Tunneller eff to Pot of AVARICE (Ballista, Box, Harvester, Dozer and Stormer) Gamestate: RANK-9 Slicer + Citadel /in Hand: 2 DRAWS /in GY: Fortress  Combo 12. 1: Urgent Schedule (Phantom Fortress ROTA) replay?id=813757-35235141  Combo 13: (Harvester/Metalcruncher STARTER) + Urgent Schedule + Machina Fortress(EXTENDER) = (RANK-10 SUPER DORA) replay?id=813757-35236213 Gamestate: Knuckle + Goliath + Super Dora(Derricrane material) /in Hand: Box + Dozer + 2 DRAWS /in GY: Bullet + Stormer + Fortress  Combo 14: (Redeployment + Discard) + Urgent Schedule = (RANK-9 + RANK-10) replay?id=813757-35236392 Gamestate: Knuckle + Goliath + Super Dora(Derricrane material) /in Hand: Dozer + 2 DRAWS /in GY: Bullet + Stormer  //////////////////////////////////////////////// TechnoPlay/Rulings:  You can Still use the SS Effect from Hand of Infinitrack Monsters on Set Monsters, as Long as the Monsters are PROPER TYPE and ATTRIBUTE.  The Activation and Search effect of Forward is HOPT. Meanwhile the 2nd effect of Forward is SOPT, so you can use multiples same turn.  Knuckle + Overdrive = ""Machina Overdrive"" SS effect from deck will RESOLVE WITHOUT EFFECT if the TARGET LEAVE the FIELD BEFORE RESOLUTION, because Overdrive check names at resolution. So cl1 Overdrive cl2 Knuckle SEND ITSELF don't works. But cl1 Overdrive cl2 Knuckle SEND Box for Example works.  Super Dora + Overdrive = cl1 Overdrive cl2 Super Dora tgt itself works because you don't need to destroy the target in order to summon. It will SS the Machina monster but fail destroying Super Dora due to either Dora Quick eff, Goliath's or Dingirsu's Protection.  Ice Dragon's Prison/D. D. Crow vs Knuckle/Overdrive = cl1 IDP/D. D. Crow target Bullet Train cl2 Knuckle target itself and Bullet Train = SOLVE WITHOUT EFFECT cl1 IDP/D. D. Crow target Bullet Train cl2 Overdrive target Bullet Train, Banished Tunneller and Banished Trencher = SOLVE WITHOUT EFFECT  ""Droll&amp;Lock Bird"" vs Overdrive = can play around Droll&amp;Lock Bird using Overdrive GY effect during the DRAW Phase.  ""Machina CITADEL"" effect to Destroy will Resolve without effect if the target leave the field before resolution, because Citadel checks ATK stats at resolution.  ""Machina CITADEL"" 1st effect to destroy will ATTEMPT to Destroy Super Dora and Opponent's Monsters: cl1 CITADEL target Super Dora cl2 Super Dora tgt itself = DESTROY all Opponent's Monsters with 32atk or Less but fail Destroying Dora due to either Dora Quick eff, Goliath's or Dingirsu's Protection.  ""Machina FORTRESS"" 2nd effect its MANDATORY so it Will ALWAYS be Chain Link 1, in the case of crash in battle phase Citadel eff in GY will be cl2.  As long as a XYZ have battled, either Opponent's or yours, during your turn you can attempt to SS Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder For example you can do: Goliath atk opponent's XYZ in Defense position and in M2 use Stormer eff tribute Goliath and Goliath eff Attach to Stormer and AA-ZEUS on top of Stormer.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////Comments:  Bullet Train on the field as soon as possible has you playing around Nibiru with at least adding a follow up in the end phase. You activate your worst cards first and best last after bait interactions. For example if you open with Starter and Redeployment you start playing with Starter and save the Redeployment for later. RANK-9 play is more sensitive to hand traps compared to standard deck play.  What you can do in turn 3: Use Anchor Drill to summon Box and go to a RANK-8 DINGIRSU and use eff to send a card or Attach 1 Infinitrack banished like Trencher for example and go to battle phase to make AA-ZEUS with 4 materials. Other plays: Discard a card to revive Knuckle to tribute for Dozer and summon Tunneller/Trencher and because you already have Stormer in GY you go to LINK-1 Goliath and use Stormer eff in GY and in the resolution use Goliath eff to attach to Stormer and use eff to Search whatever fix your hand like Citadel/Derricrane/Fortress. And again you can use Tunneller eff Pot of Avarice and make Ballista to add Box and Anchor Drill.  ***OTK Version: NS Anchor Drill and eff Special Dozer and eff Special Trencher and LINK-1 Goliath and Stormer play to tribute Goliath and attach Goliath to Stormer to search Citadel Knuckle eff send Citadel and use Anchor Drill level manipulation eff on Dozer to summon RANK-9 Slicer and pop 2 cards: one of your monsters and one card opponent's controls to trigger Citadel in GY and finally use Trencher just to summon anything and make LINK- 1 Goliath for more 1k damage for game.  ***This combination of Dozer + Anchor Drill + Box can play after too disruption in any point like in Anchor Drill eff or Dozer eff becauser you have Knuckle and Stormer in GY that can search or send to GY any Earth Machine like Citadel to control the game."

I use those that I think will be the most universal against most of the decks (not only Meta). Here, of course, a lot depends on the archetype of the opponents monsters and their support cards . Of course, Ash is dominant here. Why then I only use two. I use Effect Veiler to have an additional emergency card to pay the cost Galaxy Soldier. Other cards will also be good here such as Ghost Ogre or Nibiru or other powerful light hand traps. Here, of course, all depends on the opponent's deck.  Or maybe more about Pot's. I used 3. They perfectly complement the decks and make it move (together with other engins). The most controversial is Pot of Desires. Someone will say that this is crazy with a deck like this. And I will say: Is it not madness to leave the field blank when you have dead hands ? And if you have a good hand: you add what you have to add, you are using what you are supposed to use, you are doing a combo and finally you use Pot of Desires. Maybe something else can be strengthened hehe GL HF.  Here's a video :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3WH0gtc_lo"
