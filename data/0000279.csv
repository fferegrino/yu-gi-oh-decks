Everything in the extra deck essentially serves as your toolbox or possible combo extenders if you're having issues with gas, which may be a problem since one of the main weaknesses of the deck is a bit of an inconsistency issue due to having to run three-ofs for every monster in the Skull Servant archetype, with half the monsters being unable to start any combos. Splashing in the Lightsworn support helps alleviate this issue, by giving access to powerful spells that will thin your deck, as well as easier synchro summons. While this deck isn't meta, it can still play through a lot of interrupts and OTK your opponent. Or, if you want to play more conservatively, you're able to still build beefy skeletons with modest protection that can really wall the other player."

Normal Summon 003. Use effect to special 001 from deck.  Use 001 and 003 to make Halq. Halq effect to summon the second 001 from deck.  Use Halq and 001 to make Auroradon. Auroradon will summon 3 mech phantom beast tokens to your board.  Both 001 effects trigger to special themselves from the GY. Use a 001 and a token to make Arc Light, then use the second 001 and another token to make another Arc Light.  Use both Arc Lights to make Gallant Granite. Use Granite to add Nib.  Arc Light triggers to search Nekroz of Brionac. Use Auroradon to summon Coltwing from the deck by tributing Granite and the last token. Arc Light triggers again to search Benten and Coltwing summons 2 more tokens. Both 001s summon themselves from the GY again.  Use a 001 and a token to make the third Arc Light, then use the second 001 and the second token to make Quandax. Use Arc Light and Quandax to make Dugaress. Use Dugaress effect to detach 2 material to special back an Arc Light, then use the detached Arc Light's effect to search Nekroz of Unicore.  Use Arc Light and Coltwing to make Emeral, then use Emeral to detach the Arc Light to shuffle back an Arc Light, Halq, and 001 then draw a card. Arc Light will trigger again to search Kaleidoscope.  Activate Kaleidoscope, sending Arc Light to the GY to summon Unicore. Arc Light will trigger to search Nekroz of Valkyrus.  Use Brionac effect to search Clausolas, then use Clausolas to search Cycle. Activate Cycle tributing Benten to summon Brionac from GY. Use Benten to search Kristya, then summon Kristya because you have 4 fairys in GY. This is your end board.  Nekroz just went +9 and their end board is Unicore which negates all ED monsters and Kristya which stops special summoning. Even if your opponent can out Kristya, you still have a Nib and the other cards in hand. This board all came from 003.  This deck is insane, and even without 003 you can still make moves. High Level EDs are for Kaleidoscope."

What could go wrong?","Video link in the description below  - Exo  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=6_VO1WHQjk4&amp;t="">https://youtube.com/watch?v=6_VO1WHQjk4&amp;t=</a> )  There isn't a lot to say about the ""Blackwings"" archetype as a whole. Needless to say, there shouldn't be too much to work with when it comes to this once powerful Synchro-era deck that was one of the first ""anime"" decks that made a singular top cut in any competitive Yu-Gi-Oh since after the GX era came to a close. However from RaidRaptors to Phantom Knights; Blackwings after their prime have been nothing short of a disorderly cluster of archetype reliance and incompetent mashups of DARK-attribute monsters that either want to push for XYZ extension, or forge some <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> traps that (up until now) have no significance whatsoever. If we happen to learn from now, not all decks from Yu-Gi-Oh's past and present would perform under the cards of the future no matter the circumstance. For Blackwings, this statement speaks no different for them and the reality has hit them hard on myself and others that had played them (and called them the deck that carried the 5Ds Era).  &nbsp;  First and foremost, the main concept for Blackwings over the years has either been in favor of Synchro summoning or has been lingering on other pieces (such as Raidraptors); however for this piece, I went with a mixture of a package that fits <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> ; the recently released synchro monster <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> ; and the usual Synchro mechanics without the dependency of the DARK-attribute because of Branded-Despia. Why I chose the card <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> as the go to LV7 over <a data-name=""Assault Blackwing-Raikiri the Rain Shower"">Assault Blackwing-Raikiri the Rain Shower</a> is because of this: the fact that <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> has the ability to manipulate it's attribute (and all attributes of other monsters on the field) into your favour when special summoned on the field. As a result of this, either I can go into <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> to <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> (mainly when DARK-attribute monsters are on my opponents field, and I don't have a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> ); or I can make her attribute into the DARK-attribute and force a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>Â on all non-Dark monsters on my opponents monsters. While this isn't the go to play for this deck (and it shouldn't be always relied on), it sometimes comes in handy in case you either want a board wipe or want to protect yourself in case you want to not risk a forced board wipe on your end with your Blackwings.  &nbsp;  Then comes the Synchro monsters that the archetype has been truly know for consistently push into during it's time in my trials. Besides <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> , the other LV7 that comes in play in case we can't get access to it is none other than <a data-name=""F.A Dawn Dragster"">F.A Dawn Dragster</a> (a Synchro monster that negates effects Spell/Trap effects at the cost of lower it's level by 2). Next comes <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> , who alongside <a data-name=""Blackwing-Oroshi the Squall"">Blackwing-Oroshi the Squall</a> is needed to get the powerful <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a> (a one tap negate anything that also revives a tuner monster if any battle damage is done). Finally from what I can go for, two options I can carve out are either <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> or <a data-name=""Blackwing Full Armor Master"">Blackwing Full Armor Master </a>. In this case, the most common choice (while I didn't necessarily feel any favoritism from either in this deck) was in from <a data-name=""Blackwing Full Armor Master"">Blackwing Full Armor Master</a> , and only due to being both a omni protector and a Mind Controller that can be used to sack valuable assets from your opponents (or to give them a bad time).  &nbsp;  Lastly comes the Fusion and Link Monsters picked by me; but while there were not too many to choose from, the options however weren't as farfetched as it was made out to be. For the <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> targets: my picks included <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> , <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> , andÂ  <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> . All of these were chosen because each fit a role of either being a sniping valuable assets off enemy boards of getting rid of problematic monsters (and then you got your Triphyoverutum, the Nuclear option for <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>). The Link monsters chosen were there to either act as supporting pieces or to be initial in screwing with your opponent. These link monsters include <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Lambda"">Psy-Frame Lambda</a> , <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy </a>, and <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World </a>.  &nbsp;"

Tuner monster. You can either Fusion summon to Rising Carp to summon 2 P.U.N.K. monsters from the deck or basically summon 2 monsters by normal or special summon. Then Link summon to Halqifibrax to special summon Deskbot 001 from the hand or deck. Proceed to Link summon to Auroradon to special summon 3 tokens and Deskbot 001 from the grave. (2nd Step) Synchro summon Herald of the Arc Light, then use the effect of Auroradon by tributing two tokens to special summon Coltwing. With this, your Coltwing will special summon two tokens, which led to Deskbot 001 to be special summoned from the GY (Reminder: Deskbot 001 is not a once per turn card). Use Coltwing (lvl 10 due to its effect) and Deskbot 001 to Synchro summon Amazing Dragon. Then, special summon a lvl 3 P.U.N.K. monster from the GY with the effect of Amazing Dragon.</span>  <span>With this setup, (3rd step) proceed to Synchro Summon Coral Dragon, then Synchro Summon the lvl 9 Karakuri boss monster. Then special summon a lvl 1 Karakuri tuner. With the lvl 9 Karakuri boss monster and a lvl 1 Tuner, proceed to Synchro summon Baronne de Fleur.</span>  <span><strong>Combo 2:</strong> Follow step 1 from the first combo, then Synchro Summon<strong>Â  C u p i dÂ  Â P i t c h </strong>(This one card can basically give you more opportunities to create stronger boards and negates. Nice!). Increase her level to 5 by her effect, then Special summon Coltwing by Auroradon's Effect (Yea expect Coltwing's effect and Deskbot 001's effect). Then, Synchro summon FIRST Amazing Dragon, then Borreload Savage Dragon by using Cupid Pitch and a token. With Cupid Pitch's effect, add Synchron Magnet to your hand, then proceed to activate Amazing Dragon's effect to summon a level 3 P.U.N.K. Monster from the GY. Synchro Summon Hi-Speedroid Kendama, a lvl 6 non-tuner machine monster, then activate Synchron Magnet's effect to special summon itself to the field. Then yea, do the usual Karakuri trick from the first combo to get a free Baronne.</span>  <strong><span>The difference between the two combos:Â </span></strong><span>The first combo has a floodgate effect from Herald of the Arc Light, yet vulnerable in battle. It also prevents you from activating cards like Maxx C and Droll and Lock Bird. The second combo, however, has 2 monsters with an Omni-negate and 3 high beatsticks. Since Herald is not present on the field, you can activate cards that has a requirement to be sent from the GY.</span>  <span>These two combos can surprisingly work with a single card (E. Teleport) or two cards (any random card and a Noh-P.U.N.K. monster). But k</span><span>eep in mind that this combo is very vulnerable to hand traps, so yeah, wish you luck on getting a Called by the grave or Crossout Designator in your starting hand. You can also play Droll and Lock Bird to counter Maxx ""C"", just in case you used the first combo, since that doesn't really require you to add cards from your hand to pull it off.</span>  <strong><span>Opponent's 1st Turn play:Â </span></strong><span>Umm... Wish your opponent is ass and not some meta slave Swordsoul DPE player??? What I can tell you, for now, is to negate and bait out opponent's cards as much as possible, depending on your starting hand. Use hand traps as well to disrupt the opponent's plays (or might as well try to make your opponent surrender, lol). Then, when it is your turn, try to pull off the One-Trick Board (either Combo 1 or Combo 2, depending on the situation). Also, keep in mind that you can activate only one of Amazing Dragon's effect each turn, so yea, be careful of your own activations to prevent a misplay.</span>  <strong><span>Reminders:Â </span></strong><span>This deck is not-so-perfect, as it is vulnerable by hand traps and negates. It also provides a tiny amount of bricks as well (unless if you really played well) so yeah bear with that. I do not recommend this deck to desperate Master Duel players that are trying to win Ranked Matches lol. Play this deck for fun, I guess. If you have any suggestions, leave it in the comments down below so that, yah, I can be informed on what improvements I could apply.</span>  <span>Oh yea btw you can use Dark Ruler No More and Lightning Storm, in hopes that you can make your own board with ease.</span>  <strong><span>Edit:Â </span></strong><span>Btw currently I'm in Platinum 2 with this deck. I can feel myself promoting to Diamond, so yah, wish me luck. And hey, last season, I played consistently at Diamond 3-4 with the first combo, which gives me a good conclusion that this works in Ranked. Good Luck.</span>"

My focus is to normal summon charger, either by tributing monster such as vassal, jester, or using opponent's monster with monarch stormfront.  9-volt is a really nice addition to batteryman family, since there were no draw engine for this deck so when i successfully summoned charger, i'm usually go for 9-volt. But, sometimes i'll take solar to in case industrial already in my hand.

This time I opted for only two dakki to see how that would go.  If youâre not familiar with the mayasaski ftk hereâs how it goes.  You use dakki (who has no opt on its text) to mash itself while owning a soul-absorbing bone tower. Every time you summon a zombie the bone tower will pitch the top two cards off of your opponents deck, if you do it enough (youâll usually do it enough) they deck out and you win by default because they canât draw.  But not only that, today I decided to make a rundown on the deck!  Yes, Iâll be giving you a guide to the list!  1 Doomking Balerdroch  Balerdroch is the star of this deck. Mayasaski lacks a competent boos monster and really can only do utility plays, Balerdroch is the boss monster coming from zombie world who can revive every turn and interrupts two times if you have a zombie world out! This card made zombie world decks much more competitive then they would be otherwise and in Mayasaski it is one of the best tools you could have.  1 Necroworld Banshee  Necroworld Banshee only has one relevant effect, if itâs on the field or graveyard it can activate Zombie world directly from the deck! The zombie world portion in this deck is mainly to make sure youâre safe if the ftk fails. I only used one necroworld banshee because I can very easily send it to the graveyard without any effort.  3 Gozuki  Gozuki does wonders in this deck, it pitches zombies and helps summon zombies zombies from your hand if youâre having trouble getting certain monsters out! All in all Gozuki is a solid tool that is recommended if you want to try your hand in nearly any zombie based deck.  3 Mezuki  Mezuki is sometimes the only reason your ftk works! Itâs text is pretty simple, you banish it from your grave to summon a zombie from your grave, no opt no catch, you mill it you get a summon. Itâs very helpful when youâre trying to get your soul absorbing bone tower out.  3 Shiranui Solitare  Solitare serves immense purpose in any zombie focused deck for its ability to be 3 additional copies of Uni-Zombie, one of the most helpful zombies in the game. Itâs second effect is cool but thereâs no using it in this particular deck.  3 Uni-Zombie  Uni-Zombie is an incredible card, it mills a zombie and lets you discard a card which is helpful with zombies sometimes. This card is insane and proves to be one of the best tuners printed to this day.  3 Soul Absorbing Bone Tower  This tower is the enabler of this deck, itâs two effects are simple. You canât attack it if you own a zombie other than itself and every time a zombie hits the field the top two cards of your opponents deck hits the graveyard. The main mayasaski combo summons so many zombies that the bone tower can deck out your opponent!  2 Dakki, the Graceful Mayasaski  Dakki is the reason why this works as well, the only effect you need to know is this one: âWhen a âMayasaskiâ monster(s) is special summoned to your field from your extra deck, while this card is in the GY (except during the damage step) you can special summon this cardâ. Thereâs no opt and the timing clause is that if you tuned it for a mayasaski synchro it can summon itself, each mayasaski synchro can be tuned by a level two tuner for another one two levels higher than the previous one except for the level 11 one, who gets linked and you simply repeat the process.  3 Hajun, the Winged Mayasaski  Hajun can summon dakki from the deck, who then tunes for the Wheeled Mayasaski as they quickly go up into a spiraling loop.  3 Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayasaski  Yuki-Musume is a mayasaski with the effect to summon itself and pitch any zombie from the deck to the graveyard making it relatively easy to set up the ftk, all in all it is an incredibly solid card being held back by its respective archetype.  1 Glow-Up Bloom  Bloom is capable of summoning bale from the deck, a good effect but due to only needing one bale and the sheer amount of zombies you can send I opted for only one.  3 Mayasaski Winter  Winter is a card that can transform attack points to virtually zero in Mayasaski, plus it provides a nifty draw effect and can revive zombies, in most decks this is a card not worth playing but in a deck like mayasaski playing this card is relatively safe  1 Zombie World  Zombie World is simple, everything you ever loved is a zombie now. Zombie World has an entire structure deck and even mor just normal decks built around it, it alone counters multiple decks including dinos, Dlink, Swordsoul, Tri-Brigades, and more! I only have the need for one because of banshee  3 Mayasaski Return  Simple text but incredible help, it literally just rotas or foolish burials a mayasaski card, doesnât even need to be a monster, so you can actually search the new mayasaski trap with it.  1 One for One  Simple enough for you? Thereâs seven total level one monsters in this deck. The main purpose of this card is to make summoning Hajun easier.  3 Ghost Meets Girl - a Mayasaski and Shiranuiâs Tale  The newest mayasaski support, Ghost Meets Girl is a vanities ruler for zombies and even goes as far as to recycle a banished zombie! This card is simply insane with an effect that ends turns and.  3 Shiranui Style Swallowâs Slash  Swallowâs Slash is a handy card for interruption with two instant pops and is generally used in zombie decks in general.  2 Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayasaki  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with an immunity effect  2 Yoko, the Graceful Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with a monster pop  2 Tengu, the Winged Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with spell/trap removal  2 Tsuchigumo the Poisonous Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with even more milling lol  2 Orboro-Guruma the Wheeled Mayasaski  This is part of the mayasaski loop along with battle protection  1 Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayasaski  Yuki-Onna comes with two negates in response to graveyard summons, making it a really solid counter to certain decks.  2 Yuki-Onna the Icicle Mayasaski  Mayasakiâs newest link monster! This link three allows mayasaski to do ftks even more efficiently with its reviving effect! Overall this card is very helpful for the deck in general!  2 Yuki-Onna the Ice Mayasaki  Mediocre card meant for link climbing  &nbsp;  So what happens with all of these mills, and how many do you usually aim to get?  Well, thatâs simple  Each time Dakki summons two gets pitched, each time the extra deck summons two more gets pitched,  4 gets pitched from Orboro and Dakki  4 more gets pitched from Tsuchigumo and Dakki  4 more gets pitched from Tengu and Dakki  4 more goes bye from Yoko and Dakki  4 more incinerates from Gashadokuro and Dakki  Another 4 from Yuki-Onna and Dakki  Another 4 from the link 3 Yuki-Onna and Dakki  Another 4 from the link 4 Yuki-Onna and Dakki  The link 3 Yuki-Onna revives Orboro which tosses another 2  Tsuchigumo and Dakki throws out another 4  Tengu and Dakki Tosses out another 4  Yoko and Dakki for another 4  Gashadokuro and Dakki pitches 4 more  Yuki-Onna and Dakki for 4  and the link 3 Yuki-Onna and Dakki for a finishing 4  How many was that? 58 cards milled in one sequence, you can deck out a 60 card deck with that, mayasaski used to have trouble with that!  Strengths of this deck:  This deck can shut down a lot of options for your opponents and also doesnât have much trouble preforming an ftk as well  Mayasakiâs endboard will consist of one monster who floats 5 times and occasionally Bale and a lock to summoning  This deck is incredibly fun to play  Weaknesses of this deck:  You have no room in your extra because Mayasaski demands a lot of space in the extra  Mayasaski lacks a direct negate and has to rely on other things  A single handtrap is all it takes to kill this deck at times  This deck is one of the easiest Nib targets in the game  Overall I really like this deck! I have a lot of fun decking out my opponents through this deck and pitching so many cards is really funny for me."

Neither of the decks on this build care about it, since most of them are Spellcasters and you can just play around it.</li>  	<li>Nibiru, the Primal Being - Kaboom?

So I think 2 are ok, but now with searching <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a>, I'm not that certain anymore.</li>  	<li>Also from the comments, user @<i class=""fa fa-user""></i>kissbandit suggested some cards, between those were: <ol>  	<li>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru - Good card, but I always have protection with Spellbook of Wisdom, which I'm already considering cutting.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Sorcerer"">Chaos Sorcerer </a>- Interesting pick, but not playable, the Dogmatika engine already uses all, if not most, of Dark attribute monsters for <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> summon, which means his summon would clash with that engine.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Quintet Magician"">Quintet Magician</a> + <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a> - You put it as trolling, but I tested it seriously. It's not that bad. If you're using <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, that's even easier to summon. Now saying all of that, you are using Main and Extra Deck spaces, which can brick, so it's not that consistent.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>This is becoming comments suggestions by now, but as user @Yugituber said, you can use Invoked engine on it, but you can be careful about your Normal Summons.

It can improve the deck a lot, but it can also hurt the deck.

Dark world deck on ygoprodeck.com ,"<h1><span>1. General danger inclusionÂ </span></h1> <span>For danger we want to draw all of them but not multiples of the same card. However there are ways to get around this with certain effects and with the amount of copies of each card we put into the deck. We also have to keep in mind what we can do with the extra deck in terms of levels. So with that out of the way we did not include <a data-name=""Danger! Dogman!"">Danger! Dogman! because the card does, in a worse way, what the rest of the deck already does which is deal with our opponents field. We also don't include Dogman because the deck doesn't have any level 7 xyz and we generally don't want to summon and </a><a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! Nessie!</a> as Nessie's discard effect is much more helpful to search for either jackalope or to get our level 4's or 8's which tend to have a much greater impact in general. The only other inclusion which might be different is only including two <a data-name=""Danger! Nessie!"">Danger! </a><a data-name=""Danger! Chupacabra!"">Chupacabra! This is because as helpful as the discard effect is you must have a danger! card in your GY for it to be helpful. Therefore we only run two of them</a></span> <h1><span>2. Dark World Inclusion</span></h1> <span>Generally we run less darkworld monsters because on their own they are dead draws. However paired with Danger! monsters they provide amazing effects for the deck. We run <a data-name=""Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World"">Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World because he's a free summon when discarded. We can also use </a><a data-name=""Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World"">Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World to return Beiige to our hand and later summon him again. Therefore we only run two of him along with only two Grapha. Grapha is nice as when discarded he offers us destruction along with the fact he basically makes the rest of the dark world monsters level 8s in addition to their level, like I said he bounces other darkworld monsters to hand to special summon himself from the GY. We run three </a><a data-name=""Snoww, Unlight of Dark World"">Snoww, Unlight of Dark World as she can search for all of our dark world cards that I will talk about later along with the fact we can use her to summon Grapha from the GY or just as a level four if we're desperate. Last but not least is </a><a data-name=""Broww, Huntsman of Dark World"">Broww, Huntsman of Dark World he gives us additional card draw, lets us get Grapha from the GY, and works with our other graveyard interaction that I'll touch on later. We run three however running Broww as a two of isn't going to hurt the deck.Â </a></span> <h1><span>3. Spells and tra... oh wait there's only spells </span></h1> <span>So there are only spells in the deck because the deck is a combo deck. The goal is to combo into basically your entire extra deck or to combo into enough monsters to unalive your opponent. First off we start with our only danger spell. Danger! Response team is in the deck for a few reasons and can fix a lot of problems Danger! can encounter. Any card that can't be destroyed by battle or card effects or is just immune to monsters in general, a good example being Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops which danger darkworld would only be able to deal with using the extra deck. On top of that Response team can also be used to guarantee discards of nessie or jackalope who 90% of the time you don't want to summon. So you can either keep response team in your hand and try to discard it to use it's effects later or set it if you know you're gonna want to bounce a monster back to hand. Next up are the darkworld spells which are much more basic. Dark World Dealings is a spell that lets both you and your opponent draw 1 card and discard one card. The initial use is obvious because you want to discard cards but it also works with the dark charmer and Fabled Andwraith in the extra deck. Next is Gates of the dark world which acts as another dark world dealings that works well with Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite. We only run one of them because it can be searched with snoww and drawing more than one would give us more dead cards that we don't need.  </span>  <span>In terms of generic spells that aren't Danger! or Darkworld we run two allure of darkness, two pot of avarice, a card destruction and a monster reborn. The two allure only let us go even in terms of cards but can easily save us from bad hands or get the deck out of any tough spots. We generally dump darworld cards but if you have two of the same Danger! monster in your hand and you don't have many cards then banishing a Danger! monster can sometimes be a option. Pot of avarice is nice as we end up having a ton of monsters in the GY and you can easily avarice twice in the same turn. Especially with how we construct our extra deck. Next is card destruction which doesn't really need a explanation. Every card in our deck except most of our spells we want to discard. It also works with pot of avarice and helps put cards like Grapha into the graveyard. Monster reborn is the last spell and always gets us out of any sticky situation if we don't have theÂ  correct monsters on the board to xyz or link summon. It can also be used to steal some monsters from our opponents GY that works quite well with some of our extra deck that I'll address later.</span> <h1><span>Extra Deck with some alternatives</span></h1> <span>For the extra deck some of it is because we're on somewhat of a budget and some are just necessary for the deck to be good both going first and second. Generally Danger! Darkworld wants to go second as the large amount of destruction effects allows this deck to play around a wide number of negates. However, the first three extra deck monsters help the deck go first with extra value and creating some scary board presence. The first of which is probably the strangest card in the extra deck but a card I've had too much success with not to put it in. That card being Fabled Andwraith and the one of card we put in the main deck just for it which is The Fabled Cerburrel. Now I have this card in for extra draw as the opponent could discard a card to negate Fabled Andwraith's first effect however this deck goes so positive on card draw that this trade isn't worth it a lot of the time for the opponent. This also counters certain decks I've personally been seeing more recently, that being adventure, certain phantom knight decks/engines, and some cyber dragon. It can obviously deal with more decks and works well against hand traps in general. This is because most hand traps get discarded from hand to graveyard so if they Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, ghost ogre, or droll (it works on more these are just the most common ones I see) you still get the summon.Â </span>  <span>Next Is Number 38 who negates a spell on field which will in any case slow down the opponent. It's quite easily to get out and can be used to summon megaclops who will get us more value later. With 38's new reprint in Second Haunting he's more than affordable.Â </span>  <span>last but no least for our strange but effective cards for going first is The Zombie Vampire. She gets us a summon from the top four cards of either players deck. This not only helps fill your GY but there's also a chance to get your opponents boss monster for free as it doesn't negate the summoned monsters effects. This can also give another card the extra deck Dark Charmer, Gloomy a chance to be used on turn 1 letting you go into even more extra deck monsters.</span>  <span>Now for the stranger part of the extra deck but in my opinion very versatile and quite effective. This is of course our Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon, Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon, and Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon. The first one, Cipher dragon, allows you to take control of an opponents monster and use it as xyz material for the other two galaxy-eyes monsters you have. Granted you do have to remember this basically takes away your ability to OTK your opponent but it gets around destruction effects. Then the other two dragons can be xyz summoned using either the stolen monster or just using Cipher dragon. You can summon full photon over cipher dragon, destroy a card, then summon cipher blade over to destroy another card. This is just a whole lot of value for a very easy to summon set of cards. Note at the time of making this you can buy each of these cards for a dollar or less.Â </span>  <span>Finally in the extra deck you have you're very basic monsters. I:P to summon Borrelsword Dragon, Raiders knight used to summon Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon who is also used as a very easy otk that your opponent has to negate in some way. Finally there's number 60 who's used to extend your turn by letting you draw and discard, he's also useful to summon Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops who we put into the deck because it still lets any of your already used/negated xyz monsters still be useful and some decks just struggle to deal with Megaclops. That's the whole extra deck!Â </span>  <span>If you're looking for some rather expensive upgrades they can be any of the following cards: Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess (The Alternate Art is usually cheaper), Underworld Goddess of the Closed World, Number 97: Draglubion plus Number 100: Numeron Dragon, Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star, and Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder.Â </span>  &nbsp;"

Fusion and Synchro main monsters, but only one copy of 1 out of 3 Main Deck SR monsters. While trying to gather more gems, I had an idea.  And I thought it was gonna be terrible, but it's not that bad, actually?  Enter this mashed deck of the LiveâTwins, the new P.U.N.K. cards, and a small dash of Destiny HEROs because dear god the new Fusion is good AND I somehow pulled it. And while I don't have enough EvilâTwin cards to support the LiveâTwins, I did happen to have a decent amount of Code Talkers and a copy of Firewall Dragon to support the literal one Link Ki-sikil I have. If you wanna have a run at this deck and you DO happen to own more of the EvilâTwin Links, it honestly might be a good idea to just chuck the Code Talkers out to make room for them. Similar notes for anyone who actually owns any other missing cards - LiveâTwin spells like Secret Password, P.U.N.K. monsters like Foxy Tune, etc. But you might have to swap some cards in and out. Iblee might also be a good idea for all the Link monsters, but for the time being, I left her out.  Tested this out in Ranked while trying to get more gems, and honestly? Not that bad! Would probably perform better if I actually had more of the cards, but it did win me a few duels. Certainly went a lot better than other 2-Archetype decks I've tried to make work. I've actually won with this deck in comparison to them.  Still a WIP for the obvious reasons, but this deck may have actual potential."

The Ojamas call for aid!""","So, horrible (amazing?) realization - the ironically Thunder-type Splights support specifically Level 2 monsters. You know what archetype is JUST Level 2s that certainly need some help? Ojamas.  With their powers combined, Ojamas can potentially speed up! Or at least get some kind of assistance when the Splights are on the board, boosting and protecting them. The Splights also aren't really affected by cards like Ojama Country. Some'll actually get a stronger attack because of it! Ojamas can also go into the Splight's Extra Deck monsters, so if you can't get out any of the monsters to block off part of the opponent's board, get one of them out instead. Mix up board blocks with the Level 2 protections, and blast your opponent away as soon as you can, before they crush you right back.  Some quick cards I wanna go over:  <strong>Tri-Wight</strong> is essentially Ojamandala, but better. There's no LP payment for getting the main 3 Ojamas out. You can also play Ojama Delta Hurricane immediately after, and it makes summoning Ojama Emperor with them a lot easier.  <strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong> is the closest we're ever gonna get to an Ojama Xyz monster. It only takes Beast monsters, which means you can't put the Splights into it as material, but you can protect it, and that's very important because two of them out on the field in defense essentially creates a wall. Number 64 can't be destroyed by battle or card effect as long as there's a Beast-type monster out, so if you need to make sure you don't get blasted through, get two out to buy some time. Your opponent either has to negate their effect before attacking, or banish them, which the Splights can prevent. Their effect also lets them create a token that gains ATK equal to the highest ATK on the field at that moment, and what's better is that this ATK stat isn't affected by Ojama Country. So you can get a token out, then get an Ojama out to swap the stats of everyone on the field, letting only you keep any stupidly high ATK. I didn't include the other two raccoon cards used for Number 64, really because Splights are pretty good themselves to back up the Ojamas. If you wanna try and get Number 64 out faster, DNA Surgery could help, but it might not be worth it.  <strong>Recycling Batteries</strong> is recovery specifically for the Splights in the deck. Play it, and you've got two of them back in your hand immediately, good to go for immediate use. Alternatively, you can swap this card out for Pot of Avarice to draw two cards to put monsters of either archetype back, but you don't get the protection guaranteed back into your hand. Personally, I think Recycling Batteries is a better idea, since Ojamas can recover on their own with their field spell and Tri-Wight. But both cards are a good idea, considering you're gonna have a lot of monsters piling up in that graveyard.  I haven't tested this deck yet, so I don't know if it'll actually work as intended, but it's just really funny - especially since Splights would work a lot better with other Level 2 monsters like the LiveâTwins, who are specifically dedicated to this sorta thing. But it's a deck for fun, anyways. Heck, if you wanna go really crazy, try smushing them in here too."

There are some wild combos here, and some good tech plays, and very little fluff.  Tuned the Extra Deck a little - 2 Mechaba seems pretty standard rn for NS Aleister, but this list never needed 2 Mechaba, and using 2 slots on Mechaba and Artemis meant being a little shy on Mirror Jade targets, and particularly short on Lubellion. 1 Albaz is fine in this list - you have to manage resources well, so try not to banish the Albaz for Shaddolls until you're really done with him. Otherwise, he's fine - he's a mini-super poly which is good bait, and a good super poly target, so there are worse bricks in a lot of decks, even if I'm not thrilled Konami got me playing Fallen of Albaz.  No side deck, because that will vary based on the meta. In a deck like this, a high volume of high-quality generic interruptions are necessary, and the mix in the main is fine, so I'd advise a lot of 1 and 2 of tech calls for a deck like this, and to avoid relying on ""silver bullets"" for a matchup game plan, because in a 60 card list with no Pots and DPE but no Verte you're going to struggle to see any of your side tech, so you have to want to side it often. This list is pretty sick. I think the leaner, tighter Snow list might be overall stronger, but this list is strong, consistent, and has a comparably high ceiling (maybe higher sometimes?), but lacks some of that linearity of play."

If you have the Rngesus on your side this will be your best deck. Lightsworn has so much potential. ,"Disclaimer: This deck will make your opponents cry.  This deck has many good win conditions. You can easily Link climb with knightmares and Accesscode to clear the field and then set up negates. Just have to believe in the power of RNG.  You start off with trying to dump your deck into the gy and then work from there. Chaos space + collapserpent/wyverbuster gives you a good start. Always try to add chaos creator with chaos space. Chaos dragon almost always fixes your hand and gy, its a good card. DONT OVER EXTEND. Remember to keep at least 1 Dark and 1 Light monster in grave. Levianeer is a good extender too, i usually use the special summon from gy effect. To bring backÂ  level 4 tuner.  This deck is also good against control decks. Use Underworld to get rid of problematic monsters (Plasma, Dragoon, etc..) Bagooska can stall out a field of negates if they arent playing link monsters. Gren Maju can beat over anything in the late game. Kristya will activate your opponents effect ""Cry"". Feel free to make adjustments to extra deck. Ive tried to add zeus but doesnt come up often.

There have been lots of new releases related to token and token support, enough to actually build a specialised deck.</span>  The question of course: ""is it viable?"", well that's up to the deck and the people wielding and improving the deck.  At the moment this <strong>token only deck or (T.O.D)</strong> for short is more of a <strong>control deck</strong> than anything else. It has lots of monster effect negation and card destruction. It does really well <strong>going first</strong> with this deck.  There is a new card called ""Parasomnia Pillow"" that has not been widely released yet, but is available in it's Japanese form which can be played on <a><strong>dueling nexus</strong></a> for the time being as a pre-release. I do believe the equip card has potential to boost the performance of this deck and is great to use on your opponent's monsters.  <strong>Parasomnia Pillow effect:</strong>  <span id=""card-description"">During the End Phase: You can destroy the equipped monster. If this card is sent to the GY because the equipped monster was destroyed and sent to the GY: Special Summon 1 ""Parasomnia Token"" (Level 1/ATK ?/DEF 0) with the equipped monster's original Type, Attribute, and ATK, then equip this card to that Token. You can only use each effect of ""Parasomnia Pillow"" once per turn.</span>  <strong>Strategy</strong>  <span>It's always good to have ""</span><span>Pacifis, the Phantasm City"" on the field. When summoning any tokens you can then add any ""Phantasm Spiral"" trap card to your hand, of which is immediately playable.</span>  I do believe a lot of people are already aware of the ""Brave engine"" and how good it is, which does make this deck shine really well. The ""Brave engine's"" equip spell ""Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon"" can be used on any token and bounce big extra deck monsters back into the extra deck.  Effect rulings on tokens are also slightly different on tokens than on monsters, since they don't go to the GY or can be banished, some effects cannot be used on tokens, for example ""Eater of million's"" effect. You may want to brush up on effect rulings for tokens.  This is by no means a meta deck, but is pretty decent. Hope you have fun!"

The first deck I planned building after coming back to Yugioh 5 years after having duels at school with crazy old cards. Ended up building RDA over it but hey it's whatever.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>First decklist I made for a ZARC deck was absolutely abhorrent as I had zero clue what I was doing. When I played with friends, stuff like Blue Eyes was impossible to get over. Took me a while to learn new Yugioh (especially Pendulum) and here I am now with the last version of Z-ARC I'll be making.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>ã MAIN DECK ã</span>  <span>â¥ Monsters:Â </span>  <span>Pretty basic Pendulum Magician stuff but with extras, because this deck is about Z-ARC, not building a board of 8 negates after a 10 minute turn.Â </span>  <span>Black Fang, White Wing, Purple Poison, Oafdragon, and Wisdom-Eye all at 2. Black Fang / White Wing / Purple Poison can all be scales, but their main purpose is to be material for Z-ARC. We're not running any of the actual Extra Deck requirements for Z-ARC, just the main deck substitutes. Oafdragon as a good low scale, and to grab a card from the ED. Wisdom-Eye is there to place scales as per usual.</span>  <span>Astrograph, Chronograph, Darkwurm, Gate Zero, Celestial Magician, Arc Pendulum, Deskbot 001, and O-Lion all at 1. The Sorcerers are pretty obviously there to summon Z-ARC, or be used as Link fodder to send em back to the Extra Deck. Darkwurm can be used as a play starter, using things like Foolish Burial or Dragon Shrine to send it to the GY and then use it's effect to summon it. Gate Zero is a great low scale that also has a decent but not very useful effect when we have Z-ARC out. Deskbot 001 and O-Lion are there for the Halq / Auroradon Synchro combo, but I'll get to that later.</span>  <span>Skullcrobat at 3 because it's Skullcrobat, no explanation needed. Free search for a Normal Summon.Â </span>  <span>â¥ Spells &amp; Traps:</span>  <span>Raigeki and Reborn as just basic and useful spells. You can replace these with more handtraps like Veiler or good going second cards like Lightning Storm or Droplet. I just like the cards themselves because they're OG but still useful. Though I have been considering swapping them for Droplet.</span>  <span>Pendulum Call and Duelist Alliance as more searches. Pretty basic stuff. Pendulum Call is only at 2 because we do use Pendulum effects decently often with Wisdom Eye and Oafdragon. Star Pendulumgraph for Scale protection and draw power when you bring out Electrumite.Â </span>  <span>Dragon Shrine and Foolish Burial are here to quickly get either Darkwurm or the Magicians needed for Z-ARC. If you get Dragon Shrine, send Arc Pendulum so the second effect procs and you can send another Dragon, aka Darkwurm. That's why I use Arc Pendulum rather than the original, because it's a Normal monster which means Dragon Shrine can be used at full potential.</span>  <span>Imperm is pretty obvious. Just a good negate. You can once again swap it out for whatever else you want.Â </span>  &nbsp;  <span>ã EXTRA DECK ã</span>  <span>â¥ Fusions:Â </span>  <span>2 Supreme Starving Venom and 1 copy of the main boss itself, Z-ARC. For obvious reasons. Z-ARC is an underrated boss monster. 4K beater, can't be targeted or destroyed, blows up enemy field on summon, and can summon a Starving Venom (or any other Supreme Kings you might be running) whenever it destroys a monster by battle. Only problem with it is how hard it is to summon, but with this deck its fairly easy, and there are other monsters you can go for.Â </span>  <span>â¥ Synchros:Â </span>  <span>Herald of the Arc Light is a good negate and also has an effect like Dark Law which banishes stuff instead of them being sent to the GY. This alone counters a ton of decks, especially meta decks like Drytron or Admancipator, which use their GY as a field of its own with tons of effects. It also has the Stardust Dragon tribute-to-negate effect. Wonder Magician is a free card pop (can be used on your scales like Double Iris to grab a Pendulumgraph). Borreload Savage is there for obvious reasons, it's THE best generic Synchro atm and not much will change that.Â </span>  <span>â¥ XYZ:</span>  <span>Utopic Future and Draco Future are there for when you get 2 Timestars or a Bagooska on the field. Overlay them for a good negator that can't be destroyed and has a decent body + stealing potential. Timestar is there pretty obviously to search for your Magicians. Bagooska is for when you either get negated, have a bad hand, or don't want to play through a Maxx C.Â </span>  <span>â¥ Links:</span>  <span>Halqifibrax is the heart the Synchro combo. Electrumite is a must in any Pendulum Magician deck. It makes Astrograph basically always be on your field, can destroy a card for an effect like Double Iris, gives you draw power, and has good Arrows.Â </span>  <span>Auroradon is there, once again, for the synchro combo. Spawns tokens on summon, tributes itself and 1 token to summon O-Lion.Â </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Apollousa is the best Link monster negate and is easy to make, with generic materials. Once per CHAIN negate??? Of course Apollousa is in here. If you don't want another negate, use something like Accesscode or Borrelsword.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>ã SIDE DECK ã</span>  <span>â¥ You can run DPE instead of the Synchro combo package if you want, I just don't run it because I don't find it fun.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>That's about it, Z-ARC is one of my favorite cards and while this deck might not be too competitive, it is incredibly fun thinking of all the combos and managing all the needed Magicians to big brain Z-ARC out as fast as possible.Â </span>"

You could go into Joyous Melffys instead of Melffy of the Forest if you have Melffy Hide-and-Seek or Melffy Tag. Once you have Melffys of the Forset on the field you can go into Joyous Melffys. Joyous is nice for its quick effect allowing you to special summon monsters from the graveyard. The best targets to go for are Melffy Catty, Melffy Puppy, and Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest. Melffy Catty allows you to search cards from the deck, Melffy Puppy allows you to summon from your deck, and Kalantosa allows you to destroy one of your opponent's cards. Kalantosa is one main way to get rid of cards in this deck. Alpha, the Master of Beast is a quick way to get a powerful 3000 ATK monster out on the field with the benefit of returning cards to your opponent's hand. It's one of the best cards due to its ease of summoning and ability to get rid of cards with protection.  Have fun running this deck :)"

Now that you have two tuners on the field, go into Halq, summon 001, then into Aurorodon, summoning back 001. From here, go into One of the two Cupid Pitch's, increasing the level by one. Then summon our Coltwing from deck using Aurorodon, summoning back 001. Go into your second Cupid Pitch, decreasing its level by one. Now you can make Borreload Savage Dragon, and F.A. Dawn Dragster or Clear Wing Fast Dragon. Remember to use Cupid Pitch's effect to search a monster with 600 Def from deck (all of our level 3 P.U.N.K.s meet this condition). Remember to activate your P.U.N.K. effects to search for cards, like Madame Spider and Wa Gon.  &nbsp;  At this point, your graveyard is pretty full so you can use a Pot of Avarice to net two more cards. Its very possible that you still haven't normal summoned, and if so we can either normal a Sharakusai to Synch off into an Amazing Dragon or Psychic End Punisher during the opponents turn, or use our Sharakusai to extend further if we have not yet used his effect. In that case, we can make Rising Carp, using Carp to search a level 3 P.U.N.K. and Deer Note. Synch these two into Chaos Ruler, using Chaos Ruler's effect to search and Deer Note's effect to bring back Sharakusai which we can Synch off with Chaos Ruler during the opponent's turn."

Its primary purpose is the summoning and control of Blue-eyes White Dragons and Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon. This is accomplished through the use of Maiden's with eyes of Blue and both White Stone variants. Its protections come marginally from spell and traps. Instead its primary field protections are in the summon and use of its synchro summon Azure-Eyes. Not a deck for beginner's nor for tournament play. For as many strengths and plays as this deck has it is constructed with just as many exploits and weaknesses. Its design set to challenge opponents and inspire them to come back for another try.

No this is not a good deck and no it was not made with the banlist in mind (younger me would have probably thought you where lying when you told him that Pot of Greed was banned from play or that you where only allowed one monster reborn) so there are some issues there. Although I do still think that some of these old school cards could work in other decks (namely <a data-name=""D.D. Scout Plane"">D.D. Scout Plane</a> and <a data-name=""Sacred Crane"">Sacred Crane</a>.) It did have some changes made to it around 2012 when Legendary Collection 3 released so this is the final form of it.

The deck does somewhat struggle against swordsoul but thats to be expected considering swordsoul's one of the best decks of the format.  It does however do well in sky striker matchups and, orcust as well as some other decks.  Im not using any of the more generic link monsters or synchros aside from insects so feel free to throw those in."

Other Archetype cards that catch my attention are <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> and <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> because they are the only way for Fluffal to <strong>interact in the opponent's turn</strong> via the engine. This is an underrated deck mainly because in the last few years since its last supports players have focused on a <strong>unique Win Condition</strong> for when the deck goes first like making <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a> (VFD) and <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> lock. Of course, when you resolve these cards victory is practically guaranteed but the <strong>Fluffal engine itself has the potential to make End Boards with many versatile interactions</strong> without having to resort to cards that end up on the Banlist sooner or later. VFD has been banned for a long time and Artifact Scythe is next on the list, so the way I'm going to present what Fluffal gameplay I consider the safest because no matter what the next banlist is this deck will continue with the same power level as long as many other decks in the meta will take heavy hits which will <strong>lower their powercreep relative to Fluffal</strong>. I had already made a presentation of the deck in <strong>Fusion format</strong>: https://ygoprodeck.com/fluffal-fusion-format-may22/ and basically this is the continuation of how the deck plays in <strong>Traditional format</strong>. Of course, combos and things I said in that format are also valid for this one, but as the extra deck is not restricted, you can do more advanced combos.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combos:</strong> Let's start with small card combinations that complement the combos I talked about in the previous profile deck:  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 1: Dog + Patchwork (Blind Second OTK)</strong>  NS <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> and eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a>  Activate <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> Add <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> SS Sheep and eff return Dog to Hand and SS Edge Imp Chain LINK-2 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> and Edge Imp Chain eff Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> Activate Frightfur Fusion summon <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>(banish Sheep and Edge Imp Chain) Activate Polymerization Fusion <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a>(same Zone Cross-Sheep)(using Kraken and Dog) Sabre-Tooth eff Reborn Kraken cl1 and Cross-Sheep eff Reborn Dog cl2  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-37309876  Gamestate: Cross-Sheep + Dog + Saber-Tooth + Kragen = <strong>10400damage</strong>  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 2: (Dog + Edge Imp Chain) + Random Discard (Blind Second)</strong>  NS <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a> and eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> and eff discard to GY to Set <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> from Deck Activate Toy Vendor and eff Discard <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> to DRAW 1 and Special or Discard Edge Imp Chain eff Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> and Activate Patchwork Add <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>  Activate Polymerization and Fusion <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> (using Dog and Sabres and [Summon in the <strong>Middle Zone</strong> Column]) Cruel Whale eff Destroy Toy Vendor and Opponent's Card ***Toy Vendor eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> and Cruel Whale eff tgt itself send <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> to GY Frightfur Repair eff banish from GY to Special Dolphin from Hand Dolphin eff Set Toy Vendor and Foolish <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> Activate Toy Vendor and eff Random discard to DRAW 1 and Special or Discard Wings eff banish itself and Bear from GY to DRAW 2 and Send Toy Vendor to GY and Toy Vendor eff Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> SS Sheep from Hand and eff Return Dolphin SS Edge Imp Chain from GY LINK-2 <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> and Edge Imp Sabres eff Reborn from GY(zone Cross-Sheep points to) and Cross-Sheep eff Reborn Dog  To finish the OTK you have several ways: If you have Polymerization = Fusion <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a> using Dog and Sabers (Kraken Attack Twice) If you use LINK-4 other than Apollousa: you can do <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a> or Knightmare Unicorn and then <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>.  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38957033 Gamestate: Cruel Whale + Cross Sheep + Dog + Edge Imp Sabers /in Hand: 1 DRAW + Dolphin /Total DRAWS: 4 DRAWS, two of which depends on luck because they were made with Toy Vendor  I could make this combo even better if I had access to <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> because one thing I noticed when doing <strong>Test Hands of Fluffal</strong> was that <strong>you only reach the apex of Fluffal's deck when you manage to solve Toy Vendor at least twice and Reborn from GY's Penguin with Cross-Sheep or Frightfur Repair to extend plays</strong> by Special Summoning Fluffal Monsters from the hand you added with Toy Vendor or being <strong>extremely lucky to draw the right cards</strong> at the right time, which rarely happens.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Discussion about these two Combos:</strong> From these combos it can be seen that in both I had to play (<strong>Dog + Edge Imp Chain</strong>) and what changed was the choice of <strong>what to add to the hand</strong> with <a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Fluffal Dog</a>: between choosing to add <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Fluffal Bear</a> or choosing <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a>. I've come to the conclusion that making the <strong>Edge Imp Chain eff trigger move with Fluffal Bear</strong> set <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> to discard it will be the best option in most situations because <strong>triggering Toy Vendor multiple times</strong> in the same turn <strong>guarantees you to build solid plays and that rely less on luck as you add the Fluffal Monster you need at that gamestate with Toy Vendor</strong>. For example you can make <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a> by destroying the Toy Vendor and adding <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> and <strong>if you have an Extender</strong> you bring the Dolphin to the field and set the Toy Vendor by sending <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> to the GY and generate even more advantage. So most of the time <strong>Fluffal's problem to continue playing is just putting the Toy Vendor Search on the field because when you manage to do that you reach the apex of the deck</strong>.  Playing with <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> is only worthwhile when you <strong>already have</strong> <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> in hand because you will make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> very early in the combo using <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> material and then Fusion Summon using Penguin as material that will be <strong>Reborn of the GY with Cross-Sheep allowing you to Extend moves</strong>. But even so, you are faced with the dilemma of <strong>having to draw a Dolphin or something similar to continue</strong> after Fusion Summon so in practice comboing through <strong>Toy Vendor is always better for taking the randomness of miraculous Draws to continue playing since you have several one-offs in the deck that just want to add to the hand at the right time</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// That said, if the problem is that you can extend the plays after the Toy Vendor Search and put the monster on the table by Special Summoning from the hand, then how to increase the chance of making your combo work? Basically you have <strong>three ways via the Fluffal engine</strong> to Special Summon your hand monsters: <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>, <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a>.  Thinking only of turn 1 deck plays, the only ways to resolve the extender <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> would be: - you use the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> combo to Add Repair for the hand and the <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> sends a Fusion to the GY - <strong>hard draw</strong> her and you have a lot of Draw effects for that and then send a Fusion to GY - or <strong>send it straight from the deck to the GY</strong> with <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> <strong>or discard it</strong> to resolve cards like Toy Vendor and Penguin.  The <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> is a Extender of Special Summon from Hand that by itself <strong>depends on luck to resolve</strong> because you need to <strong>DRAW a Fluffal Monster</strong> to be able to Special Summon it. However, there is a way via the engine to make this effect always resolve: use <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> eff to <strong>return a Fluffal Monster to the top of the deck</strong>.  And <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> will be an Extender <strong>whenever you summon a different copy of it to the field</strong>, so it's the easiest of the three to resolve in theory. The problem is you can bring him to the field because the easiest way would be for you to Fusion Summon using Penguin as material and use <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> to Reborn Penguin. However, the Fluffal engine in the pure version <strong>cannot Cross-Sheep before Fusion Summon most of the time</strong> because you only start the turn by putting two monsters on the field as follows: - Use <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> eff to return a Fluffal monster like Fluffal Dog to the hand and bring an ""Edge Imp"" monster instead - <strong>Be lucky</strong> enough to use the Toy Vendor effect and hit a Fluffal Monster to Special Summon ANY monster in your hand. So you're faced with having <strong>to do Cross-Sheep only towards the end of the Combo</strong> when you've already done Fusion Summon and <strong>to trigger your Reborn effect you have to use</strong> <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a> eff on the GY as I showed in Combo 2 and that's <strong>not it's very efficient</strong> because again we get into the story of you needing to get out of inertia to use this effect but the opponent's interactions will stop you most of the time.  Anyway, using <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a> as an Extender depends on what your play is going on, so there's <strong>no guarantee you'll always access it</strong>, especially since it's a one-off card. As for <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>, you <strong>maximize the number of copies in the deck</strong> to make sure you can use them during your combos. After all this fuss comes the point I want to make about <strong>how to increase the consistency of the deck</strong> to use your main extenders (<a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a>) in the best possible way:  - We have to use <strong>Extenders from outside the archetype</strong> which are the examples of Main Deck and Side Deck cards that I put just to discuss this subject:  - <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> that has excellent <strong>synergy with</strong> <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and is still a body on the field to make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> <strong>as soon as possible</strong> making it the <strong>second best generic Enabler card option</strong> for the Fluffal deck.  - In the Side Deck I put more examples of <strong>cards that function as a body on the field</strong> to make <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a>: <strong>Hand Traps</strong> that not only interact with the opponent but also stay on the field like <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a> and <a data-name=""Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay"">Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</a>.  But the suspense I leave is to present the <strong>best generic Enabler card option for the Fluffal deck</strong>: <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> and <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> package. This engine <strong>does the same role as the Golden Lord</strong> of interacting with Toy Vendor and Cross-Sheep only in a much better way: - You now have a <strong>second way to stack the top of the deck with a Fluffal monster</strong> to take the <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> eff randomness out of Draw ensuring <strong>you will Special Summon it</strong>. - Second that you <strong>pay the discard of the activation of the Toy Vendor's Draw effect with the Illusion of Chaos</strong> itself that you didn't return to the top of the deck. - Thirdly, <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> will enter the field to be <strong>half of the</strong> <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> apart from not being able to do it early in the combo. - Room that like the Golden Lord you <strong>send the Toy Vendor to the GY to buy cards at the same time you get a Search</strong>. - Fifth it is Dark attribute so it's half a <a data-name=""Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> to make <strong>moves to force interactions</strong> like stealing the <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> from the opponent's GY. In short, using 2 <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> + 3 <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a> is mandatory in any <strong>competitive Fluffal build currently</strong>, I'm just not using it because this is a version I tested before I understood the importance of the Souls package in the deck. So you've just discovered the <strong>best deck in the game to abuse the Illusion of Chaos package</strong>.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Test Hands</strong>: These are some replays I did about my progression in learning how to use Fluffal in the best way possible. At that time I still used <a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Fluffal Owl</a> in the deck so that's why I left it in the Side Deck to comment on this fact, I also used 3 <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> but I saw that these two cards weren't that good in the deck because you don't Fusion Summon that much to win games. These test hands are <strong>not didactic, so many times I had to go back a move because it wasn't the best option</strong>. And there are times that in the random draws of cards like <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> I added from the deck to the hand instead of buying because I already knew the draws that would be because this is an <strong>improved version of the test hand compared to the original I had made</strong> with the same Opening Hand and that I had realized that I made a move wrong and this is the final version of the best way to make each combo. One thing that is clear in these replays is that they take away any doubts anyone might have about wanting to <strong>play Fluffal Blind Second because they think turn 1 of the deck is weak when in fact you can always setup at least 3 interactions</strong>, including <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> + <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> and Bahamut Shark bringing <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and also the interaction of <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>. I'm not one to make <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a> turn 1, I prefer the <strong>versatility of I:P Masquerena</strong> that can either become an Apollousa on the opponent's turn or a <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>. I only do Apollousa on turn 1 in combos where I've Special Summoned so much that <strong>I need to clear my field to have room for other plays</strong> and that's exactly Apollousa's role in most decks in the game: turning multiple <strong>monsters that are doing nothing on the field in an omni negate</strong> making room for you to do more atrocities.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38832002 TEST HAND 1 Penguins Garden + (Edge Imp Chain + Dog) + Octopus = Cross-Sheep + I:P Masquerena + Penguin /in Hand: Edge Imp Scythe But I could have done it differently: 1 - Use Penguins Garden to discard Edge Imp Chain 2 - Give NS from Fluffal Penguin and SS Dog to Add Dolphin (but this move really needs Sheep to work so this turns out to be the best way to play) *3 - <strong>Replay error</strong>: I had already used the Dog effect so I had to bring the Octopus straight and I had to fix this move.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38832768 TEST HAND 2 Dog + Wings + Dolphin + Polymerization + Patchwork I hit Toy Vendor allowing SS to Dolphin and DRAW Penguin + Scythe and Add Octopus Dolphin send Edge Imp Sabers Set Toy Vendor and Activate Patchwork Add Edge Imp Chain  Cruel Whael Fusion move and first use Frightfur Repair effect for Reborn Penguin and Bahamut Shark + Toad and then Cross-Sheep Edge Imp Sabers play + Toy Vendor and Cross-Sheep Reborn Penguin / Toy Vendor discard Scythe and SS Octopus and Add Scythe to Hand I:P Masquerena + Abyss Dweller  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38833408 TEST HAND 3 Toy Vendor + Patchwork + Edge Imp Sabers + 2 Penguins ***Fusion Frightfur Tiger to destroy your own Toy Vendor to make Dolphin send Wings Combo. LUCK: Buy Sheep = allows you to reach Cross-Sheep for you to then play Edge Imp Sabers + Toy Vendor Reborn GY's Penguin with Cross-Sheep and brought Dolphin to the hand and make Bahamut Shark and then made Toy Vendor buy Penguin to have the missing Octopus summon extender to add Edge Imp Scythe back to the hand.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38833944 TEST HAND 4 (Dog + Edge Imp Chain) + Scythe + Wings + Repair LUCK: I hit the Toy Vendor DRAW Penguin and was able to Special Summon Edge Imp Chain and make LINK-2 Cross-Sheep and add Patchwork Big Brain: Making Tiger Destroys Patchwork and Reborn Penguin and Search Dolphin Do Dolphin eff send Octopus because it had Repair in Hand and Bahamut Shark + Toad and Reborn Octopus Add Scythe to Hand Wings Combo = Toy Vendor Add Sheep = Lambda  END BOARD: Cross-Sheep + I:P Masquerena + Lambda + Toad /in Hand: Octopus + Scythe + Penguin /in GY: Repair + Edge Imp Sabers  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38834453 TEST HAND 5 (Toy Vendor + (Bear + Edge Imp Chain) + Penguin + Scythe) Make play Tiger and destroy Toy Vendor at the same time DRAW 2 Discard 1 Toy Vendor Add Dolphin and Dolphin combo with Wings and Add Sheep = Cross-Sheep while returning Dolphin to the hand Edge Imp Sabers eff Reborn from GY and Cross-Sheep eff Reborn Penguin and Penguin eff to make Bahamut Shark + Toad  END BOARD: Cross-Sheep + I:P Masquerena + Tiger + Toad /in Hand: Edge Imp Scythe + Toy Vendor  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38834899 TEST HAND 6 Gamma + Dog + (Penguin + Patchwork) + Polymerization Add Scythe to guarantee Fusion Summon play on the opponent's turn and gave Redundant Draws with Penguin I did Normal Summon Dog and Add Octopus to Special and Add Scythe to Hand.  END Board: Lambda + Octopus /in Hand: Scythe and Follow Ups.  <strong>If I had negated a Hand Trap with Gamma</strong>: Cross-Sheep and changed it to (Tiger move destroys Toy Vendor) Dog = Bear = Toy Vendor and destroy to add Dolphin and Penguin comes back from GY with Cross-Sheep to bring Dolphin from hand and you do Full Combo.  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38835398 TEST HAND 7 Gamma + (Penguin Garden + Owl) + Scythe + Repair LUCK: Penguin DRAWS = Wings + Toy Vendor LINK-2 Lambda and Repair eff Reborn Penguin and plays Fluffal Wings and Toy Vendor LUCK: DRAW Foolish Burial Goods and Search Dolphin Dolphin Send Played Edge Imp Sabers and Bahamut Shark + Toad Foolish Burial Goods = Octopus and Edge Imp Sabers return Octopus and Toy Vendor DRAW and Special it to Add Edge Imp Scythe back to Hand  End Board: Lambda + Toad + I:P Masquerena + Octopus + Toy Vendor /in Hand: Scythe + Gamma /in GY: Penguin + Edge Imp Sabers + Repair  ///////////////////////////////////////////////  https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-38848897 TEST HAND 8 Toy Vendor + (Bear + Edge Imp Chain + Penguis Garden) + Driver I used Dolphin as a fusion material because I wanted to return one of the Polymerizations to the deck and have a valid target to activate Patchwork on the next turn. Whenever you use Edge Imp Scythe as a Fusion material, it's because you've already thought about adding it back to the hand with Fluffal Octopus whose main function is exactly to leave Scythe + Penguin's play alive on the opponent's turn. I made a <strong>mistake</strong> in order to bring Dog into the field as I needed to bring Octopus as a priority.  END Board: Apollousa(24ATK) + I:P Masquerena + Toad + Edge Imp Chain /in Hand: Scythe /in GY: Sabers + Dolphin + Penguin + Repair + Toy Vendor  ///////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Final explanation about some Cards:</strong>  Always summon the <strong>Fusion Monster in Middle Zone</strong> because that zone <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> <strong>will ever points to</strong>. Speaking of monster zones always summon <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> or <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> in the Extra Monster Zones Column to avoid conflict with Cross-Sheep.  /////////////////////<strong>Main Deck Cards:</strong>  <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Fluffal Octopus</a> will grant you the <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> back to the hand if you <strong>had to discard it for the GY or use it as Fusion Material</strong> and even Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Sheep"">Fluffal Sheep</a> to the hand and Special and return the Octopus to the hand to bring an ""Edge Imp"" monster from the GY. And if you bring him in on your opponent's turn with <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> you continue to <strong>add GY Monsters to your hand for free</strong>. An interesting thing about the effect when used as a Fusion Material is that you in addition to <strong>returning</strong> <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a> (used as <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a> material) to the GY you can also return any other Banished Monster like <a data-name=""Psy-Frame Driver"">Psy-Frame Driver</a> to the GY and the Gamma will come alive again.  <a data-name=""Royal Penguins Garden"">Royal Penguins Garden</a> Continuous Spell allows you to do 2 card Full Combo because it adds <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Fluffal Penguin</a> on activation and <strong>can decrease Penguin Level to discard a card</strong> and we have great discards like <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>. For example with Edge Imp Chain Add <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a> and Add Polymerization and Scythe/Sabres. The same goes for Toy Vendor that you discard and Add <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Fluffal Dolphin</a> to make a move to set it back and send <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> to the GY. The only downside is not being able to do <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> because it becomes Level 3 but even that is easy to get around by doing Fusion Summon it goes back to Level 4 and just <strong>Reborn with Cross-Sheep for example to make Bahamut + Toad</strong>. Being a Spell in the s/t Zone you take advantage of cards like <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> and <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> by sending it to the GY for free.  <a data-name=""Phantazmay"">Phantazmay</a> is a good card in the deck because drawing two cards will allow you to leave <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Edge Imp Scythe</a> alive on your opponent's turn to make <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> and basically you get two Monsters on the field with one protecting your cards from being targeted.  /////////////////////<strong>Deck interactions with Artifact Scythe for anyone who wants to use it:</strong> Another interesting interaction of <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Fluffal Octopus</a> is with <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> taking <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> and you make Cruel Whale using it as material then you return Scythe to GY and destroy <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a> with Cruel Whale for even after Cosmic Cyclone manages to lock it Extra Deck. <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> even if you hard draw him you can fearlessly discard to GY because you can just pass with <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a> and on the opponent's turn Edge Imp Scythe summon <strong>Cruel Whale to pop Dagda and trigger eff to Reborn Artifact Scythe</strong> and lock opponent's from use Extra Deck anyways.  /////////////////////<strong>Extra Deck Cards:</strong>  One thing some people don't know about <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> is that you don't have to specifically Summon an Extra Deck Monster type and have to trigger eff because any monster that you Special Summon in a zone it points to <strong>already triggers its effect if you have a Fusion Monster in the other Zone it points</strong> to you will Reborn a Level 4 or lower GY Monster in the same way.  <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> has <strong>secret 500ATK Boost effect</strong> that no one remembers when using a <strong>WATER monster</strong> as Xyz Material so your fusions like <a data-name=""Cruel Whale"">Cruel Whale</a> and <a data-name=""kraken"">kraken</a> become even stronger with Abyss Dweller on the field.  One Extra Deck card that I'm definitely thinking about taking out to play a competitive version of Fluffal is <a data-name=""Sabre-Tooth"">Sabre-Tooth</a> because I've never had to so it's <strong>just taking the place of a more useful card</strong>. I would instead use cards like <a data-name=""Dragostapelia"">Dragostapelia</a> for Super Polymerization, or <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> which is giant at times when you need to buy time in the game, test <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> in place or put a LINK-4 ending games like Accesscode Talker.  /////////////////////<strong>Explanation some Side Deck cards:</strong>  I'm not using <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> because it's pretty clear that this card will be banned and this deck doesn't have the absurd fusion spell of strong and boss monsters at the level of <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> and <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. Speaking of DPE, using it in this deck doesn't make any sense because you're just trying to do what a lot of competitive decks do only worse.  The best target to use <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> in the deck would be to use <a data-name=""Dragostapelia"">Dragostapelia</a> given the popularity of Fusion monsters in the format and you don't have much room in the extra deck to put more than one Super Poly target.  <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> is an insane card for Fusion decks and in this deck you even get protection while you have Polymerization in the GY and you use generic materials to make it so we can use cards like Eldlich the Golden Lord and Psy-Framegear Gamma as Fusion Material.  ////////////////////////////////////////////// <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, these are just examples of cards I've used to discuss their use in the deck.  &nbsp;"

This version of the <em>Exodia</em> <em>deck</em> focuses on blocking the opponent attacks and drawing lots of cards until you get the 5 pieces in your hand.  Almost all monsters are to be set in face-down DEF position, exception made for the Cyber Valley which has to be summoned in ATK position (and the 5 pieces of Exodia, of course). Lots of spells and traps focus on preventing or defending from attacks, while the rest are for drawing and searching the 5 pieces. The deck must be exactly 40 cards in order not to lower the probability to draw the 5 pieces.  A couple of simple <strong>combos</strong>: - <a data-name=""Reckless Greed"">Reckless Greed</a> must not be used until you can activate 2 or 3 simultaneously (to skip only 2 draw phases, but drawing 4 or 6 cards) or, alternatively, in desperate situations. - <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a> works really well with <a data-name=""Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"">Scrap-Iron Scarecrow</a> and <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a>, but of course it's quite easy for the opponent to get rid of this combo since it's sufficient to remove a continuos spell which is easy. This combo will probably let us gain a few turns.  <strong>Side Deck</strong> analysis: - <a data-name=""Crystal Seer"">Crystal Seer</a> is the most valid monster we kept outside the deck, so it might be added if necessary cycle through the deck faster - A 3rd <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a> if the first two are not enough, but it's also very likely that instead we could reduce from 2 to 1 in the main deck (needs testing) - <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> is the most valid spell we kept outside the deck, so it might be added if necessary to defend more - <a data-name=""Burial From a Different Dimension"">Burial From a Different Dimension</a> is a desperate partial remedy in case the opponent manages to banish some pieces - <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> is a desperate partial remedy in case the opponent manages to make us discard some pieces - <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> could very likely be moved directly in the Main Deck, but depends on how frequently the opponents use board wipes, is a very valid trap - <a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a> is analogous to the <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> - <a data-name=""Royal Oppression"">Royal Oppression</a> has to be used with opponents making a lot of special summonings - <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a> is for stopping decks with combos relying on specific monsters  A <strong>variant of this deck</strong> is possible as follows: <em>Remove</em>: - 3x <a data-name=""Scrap-Iron Scarecrow"">Scrap-Iron Scarecrow</a> - 3x <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a> - 2x <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a> <em>Add</em>: - 3x <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> - 3x <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a> (or alternative cards as 1 <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a> and/or 1 <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> and 1/2 good card(s) from the suggested list) - 2x <a data-name=""Crystal Seer"">Crystal Seer</a> It substitutes a defending combo with a single slightly stronger defensive card and puts more effort into drawing cards.  A few <strong>extra useful cards</strong>: <em>Monsters</em>: - <a data-name=""Vortex Trooper"">Vortex Trooper</a> (another valid monster to draw some cards, but has some drawbacks) - <a data-name=""Deep Diver"">Deep Diver</a> (theoretically good, but too slow since you need to wait the end of the battle phase and the card goes on top, therefore ""blocks"" the next draw phase) - <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> (not awesome since only prevents direct attacks, but still ends the battle phase) - <a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a> (could work well with <a data-name=""The Dark Door"">The Dark Door</a>, but the <a data-name=""Shield Wing"">Shield Wing</a> si simply better)  <em>Spells</em>: - <a data-name=""Giant Trunade"">Giant Trunade</a> (could turn out to be useful in case lots of opponents use many offensive spells and traps, but we do not attack so having them to set defences is going to block them and we don't want to help remove them) - <a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a> (probably even worst than <a data-name=""Giant Trunade"">Giant Trunade</a> since it also destroys our own spells and traps) - <a data-name=""Card Trader"">Card Trader</a> (apparently good, but actually quite slow) - <a data-name=""Nightmare's Steelcage"">Nightmare's Steelcage</a> (probably too much since we have Swords of Revealing Light, but still a very valid option) - <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a> (one of the best alternative to <a data-name=""Reload"">Reload</a>, <a data-name=""Card Trader"">Card Trader</a>, <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> since you can choose which cards to recycle, but still it's a -1 in hand)  <em>Traps</em>: - <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a> (could easily add a x3 of this one to reinforce the <a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu"">Legacy of Yata-Garasu</a>, simply there were more important cards to add as defences) - <a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a> (good to gain 1 turn, prevents all possible attacks risks) - <a data-name=""Threatening Roar"">Threatening Roar</a> (alternative to <a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a>, prevent all possible attacks) - <a data-name=""Defense Draw"">Defense Draw</a> (not perfect, only saves you from 1 attack, doesn't protect the monster, but lets you draw 1 card) - <a data-name=""Magic Cylinder"">Magic Cylinder</a> (strong, but we don't care about damaging the opponent) - <a data-name=""Dimensional Prison"">Dimensional Prison</a> (only stops 1 attack) - <a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a> (maybe)  <em>Please leave some comments to let me know what your think and keep playing this wonderful format!</em>"

(if you want the deskbot line, i suggest to remove 1 monk and 1 shaman of tenyi to add halqi and auroradon)  the gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je8Q7VkUwGc  Warning: might be very boring, no DPE, no halqi combo.  Basic Combo:  1 Card: Swordsoul Emergence search for taia, banish taia, search for swordsoul emergence (if you drew wyrm next turn, you can search mo ye, if you did not search for taia) or swordsoul blackout (for extra disturption).  2 Cards: Swordsoul Mo Ye +1 wyrm bread and butter of swordsoul combo, mo ye would synchro lv 8 chixiao to search for Longyuan and synchro 10 (either baroness or chengying, if you have card effect that banish or destroy your chengying except chixiao such as called by the grave or swordsoul blackout) chengying could be solid option.  2 Tenyi (Ashuna +1 different name Tenyi) Special summon ashuna, link summon monk tenyi, use the second tenyi to SS itself, use ashuna effect to SS the different name from field tenyi (i.e. SS vishuda if you have adhara) synchro to chixiao. Now, you have two route depending on your hand and matchup, against light based opponent, you don't want to banish adhara since you want to use baxia eff to destroy monk of the tenyi and SS adhara. route 1: banish Adhara to add Ashuna from banish, chixiao would search for Mo Ye or Longyuan, Mo Ye will reveal ashuna to synchro lv 8 (baxia or drago berserker of tenyi) or longyuan would discard ashuna to become chengying. route 2: Chixiao search for Taia (no wyrm or swordsoul) or Mo Ye (have another wyrm / swordsoul card), synchro lv 8 baxia then destroy monk of the tenyi to SS adhara from GY, synchro 9 chaofeng lock light  4 card: the combo is pretty similar with 2 card Mo Ye, but you start with Longyuan first to synchro baronne to avoid nibiru, then you will synchro Baronne, then lv 8 chixiao, alternatively you can do this with taia for three hand combo."
