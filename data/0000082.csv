Burning Abyss,"Basically a deck to turbo out Norleras turn 1 and dump your opponent's hand while keeping a Tour Guide search in the end phase and probably win assuming your opponent is not playing a deck with multiple graveyard effects. You get the light fairy by making Beatrice or Mechquipped Angineer then linking it away for Gravity Controller. Or Special summoning Artifact Dagda and linking that away. This deck is extremely consistent in bringing out Norleras from my testing, about a 90% rate turn 1."

You are going to be looking for four cards to know if you have full combo: Necro Slime, Swirl Slime, Lamia, and a monster you can normal summon (preferably Kepler because he searches Gate for you). The deck gets destroyed by hand traps for now sadly, but going first helps this a bit.  If you have Kepler start here Otherwise start at step 3. <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Kepler in the far left zone. Activate his effect to search Gate.</li>  	<li>Activate Gate to search whichever of the other three you might be missing. If you have all of them, search what you feel.</li>  	<li>Activate Swirl sending Necro from hand. Fusion summons small Ghenghis to the second to left zone.</li>  	<li>Activate Swirl in the grave to special summon Lamia from hand.</li>  	<li>Ghenghis' effect can trigger to special summon Necro from the grave. (I know it sounds weird, but wait.)</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Alexander using lamia and Genghis.</li>  	<li>Send Alexander and Necro Slime to make Cross-Sheep.</li>  	<li>Now, activate Necro sending small Ghenghis to fusion summon big Gengis to the far-right zone.</li>  	<li>Trigger Crosssheep to special summon back Alexander to the middle zone.</li>  	<li>Trigger Ghengis to special summon Lamia back.</li>  	<li>Link Summon Crystron Halqiifibrax in big Genghis' spot (Needlefiber) using lamia and big Genghis.</li>  	<li>Needlefiber's effect can special summon ghost from the deck to the left of alexander</li>  	<li>Trigger alexander to summon lamia from the grave.</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Crystal Wing using lamia and Alexander</li>  	<li>Then normal summon your monster for the turn if you haven't already to the furthest left zone.</li>  	<li>Link summon Gilgamesh using Ghost and the normal summoned monster. <ol>  	<li>Optionally chain-link Ghengis then ghost to send another necro slime to the grave and protect the Gilgamesh trigger.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Ghenghis effect to set your scales with Ragnarok and Apocalypse</li>  	<li>Apocalypse pendulum effect to banish ghost and big Genghis.</li>  	<li>When ghost is banished, add small Genghis to your grave again.</li>  	<li>Now, use Lamia's effect to special summon it to the far left zone from grave by popping Gilgamesh.</li>  	<li>Ragnarok's pendulum effect triggers letting you special summon small Genghis to Cross-sheep's other zone.</li>  	<li>Lastly, synchro into Siegfried using Apocalypse and lamia.</li> </ol> At this point, the combo ends for your turn. It isn't a powerful board, but you have a spell/trap negate and a monster negate. However, the combo continues on your opponent's turn. <ol>  	<li>Use your Siegfried negate</li>  	<li>Use your Crystal Wing negate (You may decide you do not need to do either of these steps before step 3. Your call)</li>  	<li>Needlefiber's effect to ""tag-out"" for formula synchro (same zone)</li>  	<li>Chain its synchro effect and draw effect in either order</li>  	<li>Synchro Siegfried and Formula Synchron into Satellite Warrior.</li>  	<li>You should be able to destroy 3 cards.</li>  	<li>Cross-sheep's effect lets you revive formula again.</li>  	<li>Activate Formula Synchron's effect to synchro Borreload Savage Dragon.</li>  	<li>Borreload Savage adds Gilgamesh and gives you another negate.</li> </ol> Now we have a pretty nasty board overall. We severely hurt our opponent and may have won the game from this alone.  Now, the draw spells and combo extenders may need explanation: <ul>  	<li>Copernicus: let's you send a necro slime to the grave. You do not need it to start in hand if you can still fusion Genghis without using Lamia as material</li>  	<li>Where arf thou? If you have lamia, it is not as helpful. If you have Kepler, it lets you search the lamia to end</li> </ul> There we have it. As I said, my build is already tailored. You may find another variation like Dave's Artifact engine to be better."

Found the Psychic duo and started Synchro","I tried to think outside the box and see if I could do anything with Painters outside of their typical play style. They're infamously slow to get going and don't have much in the way of swarming, so I tried looking for new ways to speed them up a bit.  I tried mashing a mostly typical Painter build up with the Psychic duo for some additional play variety and swarming. Admittedly it is pretty fun and does allow for some nice creativity in a very linear archetype that typically does have that many options early on. Brionic or Coral Dragon for instant spot removal, Barkion for stopping Evenly Matched (by far the biggest bane of Painters in general), making Rank 3's like Leviair or Grampulse, or with a bit more investment Trishula/Quariongandrax for triple banish. Not to mention Trackers's attack boost or Wheelder's pop effect when used as Synchro material.  However the deck is still a massive brick fest. Playing Extravagance is out in this case if you want a varied extra deck, so your best means of draw is purely Magicians' Souls or Upstart Golbin. The duo can also contribute to clogging up your hand if you don't open well, which painters are infamous for.  While it is fun, I definitely would call the standard painter builds ""better"" as they're a bit more consistent and the variety of Floodgates that they work with over combo pieces can give them a fighting chance against more competitive decks - this build currently doesn't do that nearly as well on a consistent basis.

They're infamously slow to get going and don't have much in the way of swarming, so I tried looking for new ways to speed them up a bit.  I tried mashing a mostly typical Painter build up with the Psychic duo for some additional play variety and swarming. Admittedly it is pretty fun and does allow for some nice creativity in a very linear archetype that typically does not have that many options early on. Brionic or Coral Dragon for instant spot removal, Barkion for stopping Evenly Matched (by far the biggest bane of Painters in general), making Rank 3's like Leviair or Grampulse, or with a bit more investment Trishula/Quariongandrax for triple banish. Not to mention Trackers's attack boost or Wheelder's pop effect when used as Synchro material is always a nice bonus.  However the deck is still a massive brick fest. Playing Extravagance is out in this case if you want a varied extra deck, so your best means of draw is purely Magicians' Souls or Upstart Goblin. The duo can also contribute to clogging up your hand if you don't open well, which painters are infamous for.  While it is fun, I definitely would call the standard painter builds ""better"" as they're a bit more consistent and the variety of Floodgates that they work with over combo pieces can give them a fighting chance against more competitive decks - this build currently doesn't do that nearly as well on a consistent basis.

Add that with Verte-Dragoon, boom every d","Konami never learn, from Knightmare Mermaid, Predaplant Verte Anaconda, and now this. Disciple of the Nadir is 1 card combo for El Shaddoll Winda, combined with Red-Eyes Dragoon, you can literally play anything now and win. The Nadir combo is simple (almost everyone knows it), use Nadir dump Apkallone search Albus Nullius (you can search the other if you have dark fodder in GY), use Apkallone add Shaddoll Ruq discard Albus Nullius, now we have Ruq in hand, and Winda material in GY (Apkallone+Albus Nullius/any dark). But remember, Nadir needs to be used at the last of your plays (even Verte has to resolve before Nadir). End board is Winda and Red-Eyes Dragoon (if you play combo deck it will be better).  The Dragma lineup: 3 Nadir (1 card Winda), 1 Albus Nullius (dark fodder, a super poly with body and non-targeting too), 1 Ecclesia (another target if you already have dark in GY or Nullius is drawn, searches the trap card), 1 Dragma Punishment (destroy monster and another card if you sent N'tss). That's pretty much it, mybe people will figure things more after a while.  Shaddoll lineup: 1 Apkallone (searches Ruq or recycles itself but with discarding), 1 Winda (great floodgate, can even be replaced with any Shaddol depends on the material in GY), 1 Ruq (searchable, fusion using your field and/or GY as material, a non-targeting non-destruction removal too, the monster fusion summoned cant atk directly).  Dark Magician lineup: Standard, but I dont play Magician Navigation as its requirement is kinda hard. I prefer the searchers and draws, but most only 2 because they dont accompolish anything alone (not 1 card combo). Magicians' Souls are the best, free monster, draw, and dumps Dark Magician too. Dark Magic Attack is just searchable Harpies Feather Duster. Apprentice Illusion Magician is our atk booster (from hand/field) for Dragoon and Winda. And lastly, 1 Eternal Soul cus its searchable.  Other support: Eye of Timaeus (I prefer this than Secrets of Dark Magic cus it doesnt eat many resource to fusion summon as Dragoon needs hand as fodder), Magicalized Fusion (can be easy Dragoon or other fusion, cus DM can turn itself into Imduk which is a dragon for easy material), Spellbook engine (1 each, cus hopt and blue boy eats normal summon), Super Poly (yall know the reason), and the rest are just handtraps (can be turned into Almiraj for the Dragma, also Veiler is a spellcaster, can run D.D. Crow too as it is a dark).  Extra deck: Fusion pieces with generic links.  Pros: Winda + Dragoon are legit board, bunch of draws/searches, has handtraps and super poly, possible disruption with Dark Magical Circle too.  Cons: Other combo deck can utilize Dragma-Winda and Verte-Dragoon with more busted board, weak to D.D. Crow or similar cards like that.  Cards to think of: Other Dragma cards (can be put in, but the engine above is enough imo), Other Shaddoll fusion monsters (depends on what attribute you played, as El Shaddoll Construct is still a good card), Allure of Darkness (can be put in, but it banishes dark, it means no fusion material and we only play a few dark), Borreload (can be put in as non-targeting removal, but after testing I never have the resource to summon it).  &nbsp;"

Just like my old Timelord deck, the strategy has not changed that much, you still finish the match with Gustav Max( given that you choose so) to acquire either a FTK or an OTK. <ul>  	<li>You normal summon a Timelord monster( I recommend Michion)</li>  	<li>You use Celestial Transformation to special summon another Timelord monster in your hand( I still recommend Michion)</li>  	<li>After battle, They activate their effects and if you started the battle at 8000 LP, your opponent will have 2000 LP left if the effects aren't negated by other means.</li>  	<li>And then Xyz summon Gustax Max and end the duel.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  I added a couple of cards that really make this deck more in control than ever.  <strong>Sales Pitch </strong>is a card that makes your add 1 card to your hand when your opponent adds a card to their hand, this makes it much more easier to search out Celestial Transformation to attempt a FTK/OTK or search other essential cards. But you can't use them in the same turn you searched the card out.  <strong>Lightning Storm </strong>is a game changer here, since the deck doesn't use many face up monsters at once, it will be easy to pull off its effects, simply clear out your opponent's backrow so you can avoid ""unwanted twists"" and proceed to annihilate them.  The decks becomes much more difficult to counter it due to its destructive capabilities, and since Timelords can't be destroyed it becomes more depressing to be facing a deck like this with a deck that can't counter Timelords's effects.  And of course some decks can get away easily with Timelords by either banishing them, tribute them, or just cancel out their effects and make them sitting ducks, But only a <strong>few</strong> are capable of doing that.  So there it is, my timelord deck, feel free to use it. And as always, let me know what you think about it, Timelords don't get the recognition they deserve because they are ""indestructable"" which is not true. Timelords need some love too."

Exodia pieces not there yet?,"One of my go to decks on ygopro is my Exodia Final Countdown build. Basically, you'll have two win conditions:  Win Condition #1: Draw all 5 Exodia Pieces  Win Condition #2: Use Final Countdown and after 20 turns you auto-win the duel  You'll be making use of Mystic Mine of course to stall while you get your exodia pieces or wait for final countdown(whichever comes first ^_-). Metaverse and Demise of the Land will be your cards for getting Mystic Mine on the field. I have Terraforming(1) in the side deck if needed.  Metaverse(1) is a good trap to use on your opponent's turn and will allow you to search for Mystic Mine and either add it to your hand or activate it on your field. Demise of the Land is in my opinion the best card for getting Mystic Mine on the field. Demise of the Land is a Quick-Play spell. When your opponent special summons a monster(s) you can activate Demise of the Land and it will search out Mystic Mine and auto activate it on the field.  Obviously your opponent will try to kill off your field spell, as such I put in counters to protect it. Solemn Judgment and Dark Bribe. Solemn Judgment makes you pay half your LP but it can negate any Spell/Trap/Monster Effect/Summon and destroy it(this card is great to combo with Hope for Escape for more draw power!). Dark Bribe negates and destroys any activated Spell/Trap from your opponent in exchange for them drawing 1 card. There are other traps that can help(The Huge Revolution is Over and Starlight Road for one), but these work just as well.  Next, we have our draw power. Upstart Goblin(1), One day of Peace(1), Sales Pitch(1), Reckless Greed(3), Pot of Duality(2), Hope for Escape(2) and Legacy of Yata-Garasu(3). Another amazing card to use is Ledger of Legerdemain(2). This card basically banishes the top 3 cards of your deck facedown(you can view them) and on your 3rd Standby Phase after this card's activation, you can add those 3 banished cards to your hand. Basically perfect for getting some guaranteed exodia pieces to ensure your victory.  Besides Mystic Mine, we have other stalls: Spiritual Swords of Revealing Light(2) and Threatening Roar(2). Spiritual Swords allows you pay 1000 LP to negate an attack. This is also good to combo with Hope for Escape for more draw power! You can banish this card and it can prevent your opponent from direct attacking you for the rest of the turn! Threatening Roar prevents your opponent from battling on their turn, just make sure to use it before the Battle Phase!  Finally, we have Trap Trick(2). This trap allows you to banish one copy of a normal trap from your deck and you can set another copy of that banished trap to your field and it can be activated on that turn(even on your opponent's turn).  I have included 12 extra deck monsters in the deck more so to make use of Pot of Extravagance which can banish 3 or 6 cards from your Extra Deck to draw. If you banish 3 you get 1 card, banish 6 and you get 2 cards. I have a Pot of Extravagance in the side deck for you to make use of if you so desire.  I'll close by saying, this is a broken deck. You have 2 win conditions, you can stall your opponent and prevent them from playing yugioh with Mystic Mine and you have a decent amount of draw power for your exodia pieces/to get final countdown! This is a perfect troll deck to use, especially on the weekends!  &nbsp;  Good luck and Have fun!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

When you are summoning <a data-name=""Uria, Lord of Searing Flames"">Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</a> try to have a <a data-name=""Hyper Blaze"">Hyper Blaze</a> on board as it is the main card to finish your opponent in 1 hit. Also if it is possible, summon Uria through its original conditions in order to resurrect it with Hyper Blaze in case Uria dies. A downside of this deck is that it can't search for Uria so matches can be pretty long. You can add <a data-name=""Opening the Spirit Gates"">Opening the Spirit Gates</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> to fix this issue."

I think its perfect for link based strategies like this one (or salad e.g.).</li>  	<li>I run 2 Crusadia Draco. Of course you can run 3 if you want, but any 2 card combo searches this card.</li>  	<li>Formud skipper is a new addition, due to parallel exceed. Formud skipper + any Crusadia monster = Bagooska + Crusadia Equimax that can attack all DEFENSE (due to Bagooska) position monsters with 4000 Atk :)</li>  	<li>In my opinion, 3x Cosmic Cyclone its really nice. You have the room (the monster line up is more or less 15 Crusadia cards and the rest what you play does not matter), thus Cosmic Cyclone seems like a good fit. Decks like Eldlich, Salamangreat, Paleozoic (even decks like Cyber dragon and other) have effects that activate when you destroy their backrow.</li>  	<li>Monster Reborn, World Legacy Succesion and Living Fossil all serve the same purpose. Any of them + a Crusadia is full combo (thus reducing chance of brick hands).</li>  	<li>Topologic Bomber Dragon and Topologic Trisbaena are nice, because they can be chain blocked by Crusadia Krawler.</li> </ul> I am curious to hear what you guys think!

Here a version of the cyber dragon deck with a 2 cards combo for summon true king of all calamity T1 and kill with anaconda and himeratech ramgage dragon T2. The deck can easily go first, and still very strong go second (still cyber dragon!).  With Cyber Dragon Core and machine dup we can make true king of all calamity, one of the big boss of all the game.  Normal Summon Core. Effet add cyber revsystem to the handmachine dup summon 2 cyber dragon from the deck XYZ summon, infinitrack river stromer, effect add anchor drill to the hand. Link Summon platinum gadget. Activate Cyber revsystem reborn cyber dragon. Effect of platinum summon anchor drill from the hand. Effect of anchor drill, heim and cyber dragon became both lvl 9. Special summon calamity.  that's the simpliest combo. Ohterwise, it needs on the board river storm, and 2 monsters. one to summon platinum gadget and one level 5 for xyz summon calamity. Galaxy soldier helps a lot. With a good hand, we can make infinity with calamity. With the perfect hand, we can have cybernetic overflow.  Now i explain my choices for my cards:  3 galaxy soldier because level 5 helps a lot for the combo. Cyber dragon infinity before normal summon cber dragon core is wonderfull. Nova can reborn a lvl 5 (very usefull!)  Only one cyber repair plant because you don't want it in hand when you go first, it's sometimes difficult to activate.  Three overload fusion beacause it's an extender when you go first (lvl 5, and can foolish 2 light machine, herz and core, effect herz and core to the hand!), and we need 3 because i play anaconda and pot of desires.  Two pot of desires only because i play 3 galaxy soldier, 6 lvl 5 in the main deck. don't activate it at the beginning of your turn if you want to summon calamity!  The other cards ratios are classics, You can change the stapples easily according to the meta.  Enjoy!  &nbsp;"

I'm just going to jump into the choices here.  I have 9 slots dedicated to interaction. I've been testing with D.D. Crow, but I want backrow to send with Scrap Wyvern, so I'm trying Solemn Strike. The deck is seriously lacking effect negation, outside of Apollousa, and while it is not quite a Salamngreat Roar it does a pretty good impression most of the time. Called and Ash should be obvious. We have a lot of stuff to protect with Called, which is often a good offensive card as well, and Ash is just the most consistent hand trap in the format.  Machina Gearframe is one of the deck's main starters, and a combo piece. It's a highly depowered Stratos that is also a union monster. We're a largely main deck focused deck, and this helps find all of our pieces. I'm running 3, because we need to start plays.  Scrap Recycler is our other starter. You can use it to make Link 4s by itself, but it is at its best when summoned off of Platinum Gadget after gearframe. I've sent literally every machine in the deck except itself - there are reasons to. Often, the best monster to send is Machina Fortress. The Scrap engine requires Scrap Golem. We're running 2, because even though it is a total brick, I want to be able to use the Recycler when I see it. O-Lion turns this card into a 1 card Scrap Wyvern, and with Gizmek Orochi you can make Dingirsu pretty easily.  3 Citadel seems pretty obvious. This is simultaneously our main (recurring) boss monster and our main line of interaction. I'm also running 3 Fortress. Fortress is insane, being able so summon it repeatedly is excellent when your hand is full of monsters. Note that you can send monsters whose levels equal over 8, meaning you can pitch O-Lion with fodder to get a free token when you see that brick. 3 Air Raider and Irradiator are necessary - these are combo pieces that help get Fortress on the board while extending your combos. 2 Possesstorage are used in some of the decks combos and make some low-end hands playable. Between it and Irradiator, you have plenty of ways to use Machina Megaform as a searcher, as well as an extra floating effect on fortress (it can also extend combos).  Redeployment is excellent. While the deck doesn't always love pitching cards, it forms the core of so many 2 card combos. Machina Overdrive is also really powerful, particularly going first. If you send it to the GY you get an Upstart Goblin out of it, and it really helps get Citadel in a pinch, which is good, because that's a lot of the deck.  For Xyz monsters in the extra deck, I have 2 Dingirsu for Rank 8s, 1 Dracossack as a rank 7, and all of the Rank 10 Railcannons. Dingirsu is obviously awesome, but has some synergy with an archetype built around destroying itself. Being machine type is clutch in this deck. Dracossack hardly comes up, but it turns some low end boards into boards with an extra Link 4. It turns 2 monsters into 3. It can also help in the grind game, which is good because the deck's plan is grindy. Super Dora is pretty good to make off of Megaform into a 2nd Citadel. The other railcannons help Otk.  For links, we have Apollousa, Borrelsword, and Unchained Abomination. The Unchained Abomination is good against backrow decks, and gives us some spell-speed 2 interaction. It can also be made easily off of Triple Burst Dragon with 1 other monster. Borrelsword is there to OTK, and Apollousa is our one easily accessible way to negate monster effects. Wyvern is an essential combo pieces, while Platinum Gadget is a useful extender out of the extra deck, and good fodder for Wyvern. Qlipohort Genius gives us some generic effect negation that is really solid again Link Monsters, doesn't die to Lightning Storm, and is and Earth Machine monster, which is super relevant in the deck. I:P is used to give protection to your other link monsters, and also lets you combo off into link monsters on your opponent's turn, making Air Raider way stronger.  I like this main deck going first, so the side deck are options to become a go-second deck and OTK. I also threw in the D.D. Crows I pulled from the main.

Ok, it won't be an OTK, but with its versatility once you get on the field Toadally Awesome or D.3.S Frog y","<strong>[ MAIN STRATEGY ]</strong>  This deck is made so that you can face different types of opponents with its versatily. However, your main objective is to play around <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a>. You can normal summon <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> and activate its effect to send to the graveyard (from your hand or deck) one <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a> or <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a>, or other frogs such as <a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a> so you can use them from the graveyard. If your opponent prevents you from interacting with the graveyard, some magic cards or a <a data-name=""Unifrog"">Unifrog</a> come to your help. But which card should I send to the graveyard? Well, it depends on the situation, if you have one <a data-name=""Des Frog"">Des Frog</a> in your hand I would suggest <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a>. Anyway, after that you can activate the second effect of your <a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a> and get it in your hand again, so you can special summon it for the second time in your turn (with a ""Frog"" tribute from your hand) and send another card to the graveyard. If your tribute is another <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> and in one turn you manage to send three of them in the graveyard, you only need one </a><a data-name=""Des Frog"">Des Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in your hand so you can get three of them on the field. If you have </a><a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> you can fusion summon D.3.S Frog and play around power. Anyway, this is a control deck because the majority of time you won't be able to summon </a><a data-name=""D.3.S Frog"">D.3.S Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">. This is not a problem since many cards can counter or destroy it. That's why, if you can early in the game, you can summon </a><a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in one turn (which is very easy to do) and take control of the field with its effects. You only need one ""Frog"" tribute and you'll never run out of frogs since you can get them back from the graveyard. </a><a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> may look like a troll card (especially because of its name lmao) but it can deny every monster effect, magic or trap card when activated and it's not finished yet! If you want you can take control of that magic/trap card and place it on the field! Awesome!</a>  <strong>[ WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE SWAP FROG? ]</strong>  Don't give up. If the situation is hard, you can try to play around <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> or <a data-name=""Beelze Frog"">Beelze Frog</a> in combination with <a data-name=""Wetlands"">Wetlands</a> and <a data-name=""Aquarium Stage"">Aquarium Stage</a>. <a data-name=""Beelze Frog"">Beelze Frog</a> is not so powerful to combo with the rest of your deck alone, but its attack increases for every <a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">T</a><a data-name="".A.D.P.O.L.E."">.A.D.P.O.L.E.</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in the graveyard. Not bad! Also, if you need it, you can always count on playing defensive with </a><a data-name=""Aquarium Stage"">Aquarium Stage</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E."">, so that you won't lose Life Points and your frogs won't be destroyed in battle. If you don't have </a><a data-name=""Aquarium Stage"">Aquarium Stage</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> you can try by playing </a><a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> in defense mode (if it goes to the graveyard you can special summon </a><a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> easily) and with trap cards such as </a><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> to protect your monsters until you get the right cards. This is really common in the first turn if you don't have </a><a data-name=""Swap Frog"">Swap Frog</a><a data-name=""T.A.D.P.O.L.E.""> immediately, so don't give up until your LP goes to zero, you still have a chance!</a>  <strong>[ WAIT, NO SUBSTITOAD? ]</strong>  Exactly. You don't need it. I feel like <a data-name=""Substitoad"">Substitoad</a> is not necessary since all it does you can do it with other monsters such as <a data-name=""Dupe Frog"">Dupe Frog</a> or <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a>. I mean, you can add if you want, of course it's a banned card, but since this deck is not an OTK it doesn't really fit well.  <strong>[ WHAT ABOUT THOSE TRAP CARDS? ]</strong>  I put one <a data-name=""Froggy Forcefield"">Froggy Forcefield</a> and two <a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> cards to show you how it's really up to you. Let's be honest, Mirror Force is stronger that Froggy Forcefield. Why? Well, let's say the enemy can directly attack your Life Points. <a data-name=""Froggy Forcefield"">Froggy Forcefield</a> is completely useless in this case. Moreover, you need to control one ""Frog"" monster on the field, and since you can play defensive until you get the right card without taking damage, it can be a useless card to draw in most situations. That's why <a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> can be more useful in many situations, but some cards can counter it. That's also why I always suggest a different variety of cards, even if the final result if the same, such as <a data-name=""Unifrog"">Unifrog</a> and <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>, even though <a data-name=""Unifrog"">Unifrog</a> will be a tribute the majority of time.  <strong>[ WHAT ABOUT MORAY OF GREED? ]</strong>  I put that in the deck because I wanted to show you a non-banned deck. However, I never play <a data-name=""Moray of Greed"">Moray of Greed</a> since I prefer <em><a data-name=""Pot of Gree"">Pot of Gree</a>d </em>a lot and I don't care about tournaments. I just play for fun like playing against a friend, which is the main purpose of this deck: for fun. Moreover, <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a> is useful when you only get magic cards and you don't have monsters, a situation where <a data-name=""Moray of Greed"">Moray of Greed</a> lacks a lot. It can be also used when you want to find <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> faster. So, in the end, unless you are going <em>pvp</em> or you can't use banned cards, go with <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a>.  <strong>[ DES CROAKING ]</strong>  This is a useful card to burst damage your opponent especially when you fusion summon <a data-name=""D.3.S Frog"">D.3.S Frog</a>. You can use it just before <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a> to clear the field and burst your damage. It will be more efficient if you have 3 <a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a><a data-name=""Treeborn Frog""> cards</a> in the graveyard. Remember some frogs are considered ""Des Frog"" when on the field.  <strong>[ THANK YOU FOR READING! ]</strong>  Feel free to use this deck or to modify it according to your personal tastes, which I always recommend! This is my favourite version after trying different ones because I feel like it fits my playstyle and it can be very versatile in most situations. Have fun!"

Other control cards include Solemn Judgement and Solemn Strike.

The win condition is take control of the game with hand traps and do your basic Trickstar plays. Summon Candina to add Light Stage, get Lycoris. Remember that Lycoris can dodge negates like veiler allowing your Candina to resolve. Lilybell can be summoned when bounce to hand by lycoris what allows you to push 1600 damage and recycle 2 cards. There's nothing really new that this format promotes to the deck and because we don't have tournaments i'm going to explain how this deck is intended to work against the most played decks of the internet meta.  Against Adamatia you have hand traps like Ash, Veiler and Imperm to slow them down, but while an Ash on Granite can stop their turn sometimes normally it won't happen that way. Your strong cards here are Crackdown and Reincarnation. Take their rocks before they can summon more monsters can end the turn. Banishing the hole hand can hurt a lot because the deck need a lot of engine cards in multiple copies. Going first you can Called by the Grave Block Dragon to avoid them to have follow up but is the type of card you will side out once it doesn't mean a threat to your opponent first turn. You can side in Sphere Mode, Nibiru and Summon limit to have a much more solid chance to win the second game. This logic apply to all the combo decks that the new master rule made possible.  When playing against Eldlich your goal is to banish all 3 golden lords. Either with Call by the Grave or Reincarnation. Enemy Controler and Crackdown are really good to bait your opponent's traps and take the Golden Lord so that his traps second effects are dead. Prohibition and Evenly Matched can very much win the game, or at least change for a Judgment or a Golden Land Forever! which puts you in an advantageous  position once this deck can burn for 4000 much quicker and he will not be able to negate your cards.  The Cyber Dragon 1 card engine is really good to out your opponent's Apollousa and gives you a 2400 body. It doesn't start a chain so that's nothing to negate. Honest can be unfortunate sometimes but you will run out of resources earlier so you need a bit of extra damage to push for game faster. Scapegoat, Bouquet and Enemy Controller are also there to help you finishing the game.  Finally some people run Extravagance over Desires, but i don't think that's a good idea. You have a 50% chance of drawing a starter turn 1 while you have a 0.1% of banishing all of them with desires and a 2.9% chance of banishing all Lycoris or all Reincarnation. While Extravagance will 100% banish your Extra Deck cards so you can't rely on them when needed. The chance of banishing an important piece to the Scapegoat Combo is 90%. The Extra Deck cards are indeed not that much used but don't think they are not important. Banish Chimeratech and your Cyber Dragon is dead, Banish Borreload or Ningirsu and you don't have an out to certain cards. There are a lot of Specific cards like Trisbanea that you would just use against backrow decks, but it doesn't mean they are not important.  When building a control deck that's based on a popular engine i feel like there's no sense on explaining how the engine works. It has been working the same way for years. The most important decisions are the non engine cards and how they relate to the new meta game. So, i don't recommend using Chain Summoning, this is not an FTK deck and that card is just a brick in most cases. I'm not using Solemns because Lightning Storm is really popular this format and you don't want to set a lot of backrow. Almost all our backrow is chainable and you can go second and rely on hand traps dodging Storm. Even Going First Called by the Grave can negate Ash or other hand traps that bothers you. The deck also doesn't have a lot of cards on the field, so Evenly Matched doesn't do a lot against it.  Overall, I think it's a really fun deck to play and it can perform better than people are expecting because they have no cards on side deck to counter your plays."

It's important to keep Guru and The Hidden City on the field to keep your control of the game and search out your Subterror cards. The deck doesn't really use the extra deck, for this reason it's quite easy to get away with extravagance and get the easy draw power."
