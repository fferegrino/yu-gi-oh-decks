But before talking about what has changed in the decklist, first I will say what for me is already clear that is perfect in the deck: - the <strong>Impcantation engine's ratio</strong> is ideal for Megalith. - Engine spells and traps are also what you need to play. - The number of main deck tech cards is 10 cards: <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a>, <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. I would only put a <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> from main deck if I knew what I was facing in ranked but since it's <strong>singles games</strong> I don't mind getting lost because my opponent won on the dice and flip <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>, I'm going straight to the next game. In a Master Duel tournament, there are ways to prevent the best players from losing because of stupid cards that exist in the game: there are several Swiss format rounds so that this variance of going second decreases and in the top cut there is an improvised side deck so that the matches are better than 3 and that way you will destroy any deck that is really good by going first to put outs against the stupid cards those decks use.  What really changed my theory about were the following cards:  Overall <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> makes your Megalith engine plays much better in terms of <strong>End Board and Follow Up</strong> and that's why I started using it in place of the third <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> and the consistency remains impeccable. Using <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> allows you to play around <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> in Megalith Phul because you use Phul eff and bring <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> who adds <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> to the hand and with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> to the field and use Och and Ophiel to bring Bethor to the field at the same time as <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> adds Megalith Phul to the hand for example. Not to mention that Megalith Och <strong>counts as 1 more pop</strong> for Bethor in his standard deck play. It only has <strong>conflicts with plays involving Benten</strong> and <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> that I will talk about in detail below.  One thing I noticed a lot about the deck's End Boards was the fragility they had for cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> destroying Spell/Trap like <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a>. So I decided to test the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> on the deck and the results were excellent. It is a <strong>negate of Spell/Trap when discarding Fairy monster</strong> from the hand and it will always be done in the plays involving <a data-name=""Cyber ​​Angel Benten"">Cyber ​​Angel Benten</a> that will be the discard to activate its effect. That way you can negate any <strong>power spell that your opponent activates</strong> and in modern Yugioh there are several decks that can only develop a good play when resolving power spells like <a data-name=""Sky Striker"">Sky Striker</a> and <a data-name=""Invoked"">Invoked</a> Shaddoll Dogmatika. And your opponent will think twice before wanting to take the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> out of the field because if it is <strong>sent to the GY</strong> because of an opponent's card (including being used as a fusion material for <a data-name=""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"">Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon</a>) you <strong>add 2 Ritual cards</strong> of GY for the hand. Seen because I use <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> in the deck, just know that plays involving making him <strong>should access Benten back to the hand</strong> and so you shouldn't add <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a> to the hand with <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> but the <strong>second Megalith Hagith</strong> already that <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> will be used exclusively to add <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> back to the hand to have <strong>spell/trap negate</strong> and not the Hagith that would be needed to access Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a>. This will be clear in the combos.  Now I'll talk about <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> because my theory about him being worse than <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> for this deck has changed: What I thought was a crucial difference for <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> to be better than <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> in the deck is the fact that it gives you <strong>access to Synchro moves</strong> and can send <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> to the GY and be an interaction but I ended up realizing that for o Megalith you gain a lot of value by having a <strong>Level 4 Monster on the field</strong> to make <strong>XYZ RANK-4 moves</strong> and that using <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> means decreasing the number of Xyz and Link monsters to put <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and other Synchro Monsters which doesn't give you the same <strong>versatility that the current Extra Deck allows</strong> you to mainly go second to break the field. Not to mention that if <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> is denied it will continue to be Level 4 different from <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> which will <strong>not gain any Level</strong> so even Synchro moves you expected to make with her will not be possible.  Finally, what I like most about <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> is that it allows you to access <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> even if it is not a ROCK Type Monster and EARTH Attribute because you will <strong>always use it as Xyz Material</strong> from <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> that will add <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> to the hand and then using it and another Megalith on your field to do the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> and have <strong>Spell/Trap negate</strong>. So one of the main moves of the deck is <strong>only possible by using Manju</strong> instead of <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a>. So in this Megalith build <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> not only serves to add a Normal Summon to the hand but also becomes a Spell/Trap Negate, the same goes for <a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> which is no longer just a card to add Nibiru to the hand, it is needed to make the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// // //////////////////////////////////////////////// //<strong>COMBOS:</strong>  Put the continuation of the link on the website: <strong>duelingbook</strong> after <strong>.com/</strong>  <strong>Combo 1: (Chalislime + Discard) + Hagith/Ophiel (Full Combo)</strong> (example with Ophiel)  replay?id=813757-37517621  Gamestate: Phul(Lv4) + Herald of Mirage Lights + Portal + Emergence /in Hand: Phaleg + Benten + Nibiru /in GY: Inception + Chalislime Opponent's Turn:  - You have the <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> Spell/Trap Negate (even if you discard Benten it's no problem because just activate <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and give Hagith Reborn and <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> eff Add Benten to Hand). - It also has <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> eff tribute itself and <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> Ritual <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> from Deck and Bethor eff cl1 and Benten eff cl2 Add Manju(Follow Up). - There's <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> if all goes wrong to tribute the entire field against Combo decks. - You had a <strong>Plus 5</strong> without counting the two cards in your starting hand that you didn't even need to use.  /////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 2: Chalislime + Inception</strong>  This is a combo that at first you might <strong>think is very specific to happen but actually not</strong> because let's assume you have brick and just opened it with <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> moves. You add <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> to the hand and use the effect by discarding any other card from the hand and Special Summoning <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> from the deck to add <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> to the hand and on <strong>your next turn you will be able to do this combo</strong> because the first monster you give Special Summon doesn't matter so even if you've already spent Candoll just Special Summon <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> instead and the result will be the same. In short this is the <strong>closest to 1 Card Combo from the deck but you need 2 turns to do it</strong>.  replay?id=813757-37518128  Gamestate: RANK-4 Gallant Granite + Portal + Emergence /in Hand: Nibiru /in GY: Phul + Och + Inception + Chalislime  /////////////////////////////////// <strong>Combo 3: Hagith/Ophiel + Unformed</strong>  replay?id=813757-37518826 You could also bring <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> straight with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and add <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> with <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and tribute Ophiel and Hagith to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> out of the deck but this time you <strong>would have 3 pops</strong>.

Expect to bring <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> out to the field to use the <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> because otherwise you will <strong>have one less Pop</strong>.  <strong>Megalith's Quick effects to Ritual Summon</strong> are still the best ways to <strong>play around interactions that target or destroy your monsters</strong> because you trigger the effects of <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>, <a data-name=""Megalith Och"">Megalith Och</a>, or <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> in a chain to <strong>get rid of the monster</strong> that would be targeted by cards or destroyed by card effects and <strong>maintain advantage of monsters on the field</strong> and breath to continue playing after interactions. That's why <strong>going second</strong> is very important to know how to use your <strong>Starters and Extenders</strong> to build the final board even with several opponent interactions as you always want to access <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> while dealing with the opponent's threats on the way or part of them because <strong>Megalith has the property to play on the opponent's turn</strong> so what you can't handle on your turn you leave to resolve on the opponent's turn.  <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> is so absurd that you can use it to <strong>Ritual Summon itself from your Deck</strong>. This is good for example using <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> on the opponent's turn and Reborn Phul and eff Ritual <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> from Deck and eff Add <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> to Hand per example and that way you get a <strong>Follow Up</strong>. Of course, you only do this if you're <strong>sure the interactions you had were enough to stop the opponent's turn</strong> and you can use <strong>Megalith Phul to add Follow Up</strong> to the hand instead of bringing in <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a>. Interaction <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>: If you don't have good Follow Ups because you didn't open well but you have <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and Megalith Phul on the field you can <strong>first wait for the opponent to play to give Nibiru</strong> and Tribute the whole field and if he stops the turn after Nibiru for not having plays you simply Reborn Megalith Phul and make <strong>Phul eff to tribute himself and bring another Phul from the deck to add a Ritual to the hand</strong> and have excellent follow ups, the fact is that using <strong>Megalith Phul eff after Nibiru is much better</strong> than first Phul because it gives you more <strong>versatility on what to bring to the field with Megalith Phul</strong>, remember that you will be able to use Nibiru itself on the field to Special Summon <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> from the Deck if needed. It is only recommended to use Megalith Phul eff first if the opponent's deck is very oppressive which happens with some decks like <a data-name=""Adamancipator"">Adamancipator</a> which is absurd with <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> so try to stop his plays as soon as possible.  <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> trigger effect even if your <strong>opponent Special Summons a Megalith monster</strong> having applications in <strong>Mirror Match</strong> and <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> first eff of taking <strong>ATK from opponent's monsters</strong> is excellent in <strong>Mirror Match</strong> as well.  My opinion on using <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> hasn't changed, in fact I'm much more convinced of how good it is in the deck, having many applications in terms of making your <strong>End Board resilient and recycling your monsters every turn</strong> allowing for <strong>RANK-4 or LINK plays</strong> monsters.  <strong>Biggest MISSPLAY</strong> I've ever committed when using the deck: If you spend the turn with <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> on the field and <a data-name=""Cyber ​​Angel Benten"">Cyber ​​Angel Benten</a> in hand, you always prevent the opponent from <strong>denying Megalith Phul</strong> and just give him chances to deny some card of yours in the summon of the <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> because for example if you chain <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> to an <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> that will bring <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> it is <strong>much better than waiting for the Mechaba</strong> to enter the field for the following reasons: If it negates Phul with Invoked Mechaba you not only <strong>don't bring Bethor to the field as Phul goes banned</strong> which is horrible given the various ways to add this Phul from the GY to the hand or give Reborn <strong>and you didn't tribute to Benten who would add a Follow Up</strong> in the form of <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> making his <strong>turn less explosive</strong> and more susceptible to interactions. Not to mention that you <strong>can still Chain Block Megalith Bethor eff of destroying cards</strong> with <a data-name=""Benten"">Benten</a> so <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> always solves, that is, you practically lose the game if you don't make the <strong>right decision when solving Megalith Phul</strong> on the opponent's turn.  Drawing Bricks from the <strong>Impcantation engine</strong> allows you to <strong>make unorthodox plays that are really fun</strong> like being able to use <a data-name=""Penciplume"">Penciplume</a> eff Add 1 Ritual on the GY on your 1st turn like Benten. With <strong>training you will realize that you will need to use the Impcantation engine differently depending on your cards in the starting hand</strong>, for example if you don't have any Ritual monsters like <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> in your hand but you have <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> to Ritual Summon you bring <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> with Penciplume <strong>instead of Candoll</strong> because adding a Ritual Monster is what you need to play and <strong>not adding Inception</strong> which would do no good to Ritual Summon. I've even found myself in the situation of having <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> in hand and Normal Summoning <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> to add <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> to the hand and being able to use <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> eff of bringing an Impcantation from the deck and playing. One thing I have to make clear about Ritual Spell <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> is that before I said that you <strong>could Manju 1 Card Combo</strong> by Ritual Summoning with Inception <strong>using Manju as part of the tribute</strong> and this is <strong>wrong because Impcantation Inception must tribute only Impcantation monsters to Ritual Summon</strong> so you can never use <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> or a <strong>Hand Trap</strong> or a <strong>Megalith Monster</strong> to Ritual Summon with <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> and therefore this combo is not possible. Using <strong>hand traps</strong> like <a data-name=""Psy-Framegerar Gamma"">Psy-Framegerar Gamma</a> in addition to working as a <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> in this deck as you activate <strong>many hand effects that require opponent's response</strong> while you don't control monsters like Impcantation and in this way Gamma can negate the Hand Trap of it, the <strong>Level 2 and Level 6</strong> of the <a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a> are good to add with the <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> for example for you to activate <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> and bring a Megalith from the deck because if the <strong>sum is 8</strong> you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> or <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> and if it's 4 you bring <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>. Of course, it's <strong>not cool to use your Hand Traps to Ritual Summon</strong> but if you have to do that to play then you have no choice but to exchange Hand Traps for plays and I consider it <strong>very important to be able to get out of inertia as soon as possible</strong> rather than passing the turn with nothing on the field. Of course, if for example your hand opens from <a data-name=""Unformed"">Unformed</a> + <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> + <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> + <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> for example you have so much interaction to stop the opponent that you don't even have to worry about trying to play this turn, but if the <strong>hand comes very weak</strong> and your only move is to use <strong>Maxx ""C"" which is your only hand trap as a tribute you do this</strong>. Generally the <strong>top deck of Megalith is very good</strong> because the deck is very consistent so it is a balance where you have to predict what is best to do: <strong>use my hand traps as a tribute</strong> to <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> or be sure that these hand traps will stop the opponent's turn and on the return I have many chances to draw that helps me play.  <a data-name=""Chalislime"">Chalislime</a> discards a card from your hand <strong>by effect and not by cost</strong>, so if your <strong>opponent negates it</strong>, you don't lose any cards from your hand. The <strong>same goes for the other Impcantation</strong> like <a data-name=""Penciplume"">Penciplume</a> so if the opponent gives <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> in the effect of Chalislime or Penciplume you will still have the same number of cards in hand and <strong>will be able to use its effect again next turn</strong>. This is one of the reasons the <strong>Impcantation engine is so good against interactions</strong> as the other reason is the <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a> <strong>eff on the GY</strong> which is a very good push against opponent interactions.  <a data-name=""Number 41: Bagooska"">Number 41: Bagooska</a> interacts very well with Spell/Trap <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> to buy time and get back into the game. One thing that happens a lot <strong>going second</strong> is you can do the Megalith combo and <strong>access Portal and Emergence</strong> but the opponent has a <strong>boss monster that you can't take out of the field</strong> on your 2nd turn and you <strong>need to somehow nullify that monster's threat</strong> on the turn of the opponent and on these occasions is that <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> shines because you do it and <strong>practically skip the opponent's turn</strong> at the same time that the opponent's annoying boss monster won't be able to use its effects that would hinder you too much. So what you do is with <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal</a> you are going to use this combination of effects to <strong>special a Megalith and add a Ritual Monster from GY to the hand twice</strong>, once on your opponent's turn and once on your Standby Phase and that way you will already have <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> and <strong>at least 2 Ritual Monsters on the field</strong> and in Main Phase 1 you can use these Ritual monsters to <strong>Link Summon</strong> monsters that will deal with the opponent's Boss Monster like <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>.  That's why I consider it an <strong>essential card in the Extra Deck</strong> because there were several times I needed to do it to <strong>avoid my opponent activating an effect of his Boss Monster</strong> and with the two Monster Reborn from <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> (1 on his turn and another on Standby Phase of my turn) I already had a way to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> for example and destroy his monster and win the game by taking his Boss Monster away. An example of this interaction I can give was against an ABC player who used the <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> effect of <strong>banishing a card I control</strong> but held back too much on the absurd effect of tribute himself and <strong>bringing 3 banished Light Machines</strong> back to the snedo field he still had <a data-name=""Union Hangar"">Union Hangar</a> to equip a piece on one of the monsters, so I made <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> which messes up his whole turn by making him just pass and I made <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> to destroy him and play good. He still used the <a data-name=""ABC-Dragon Buster"">ABC-Dragon Buster</a> effect to try to bring the banished monsters but <a data-name=""Bagooska"">Bagooska</a> <strong>negates the activated effect</strong> of any Defense Position monster so it doesn't do any good for you to <strong>tribute the monster as a cost</strong> like <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> that the effect will be denied in the same way.  A very simple way to play around <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a> in <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> is to <strong>activate Emergence but not use the effect</strong>, but in the <strong>resolution use the effect</strong> because if you take <a data-name=""Ghost Belle"">Ghost Belle</a> at least Trap <strong>Emergence will remain on the field</strong> to be able to use effect again next turn, this is something every Shaddoll player should know because the same goes for <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a>. Another tip when using <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> on <strong>your turn is to use GY's Special Summon effect in the Standby Phase</strong> because this summon won't count for <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, which only counts the summons that happen <strong>during the Main Phase</strong> of the turn player.  Several times I took <a data-name=""Maxx &quot;C&quot;"">Maxx ""C""</a> and managed to make a super simple play of <a data-name=""Megalith Hagith"">Megalith Hagith</a> Add <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> and pass turn with <strong>potential 2 Pops</strong> with Hagith as you <strong>use Unformed on the opponent's turn</strong> Tributing Hagith bringing <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> who makes <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a>.  XYZ <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vesperato"">Drill Driver Vesperato</a> is very useful in the deck mainly in conjunction with <a data-name=""Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk"">Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk</a> or <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> because you use their effects and in the end <strong>they run out of XYZ material</strong> and you do Drill Vesperato for up to end the game or have a monster with <strong>great Floating effect</strong>. Just remember that <a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenate"">Drill Driver Vespenate</a> <strong>cannot be used as material for AA-ZEUS on the turn you Summon it above a RANK-4</strong> by the card's own restriction. And speaking of <a data-name=""Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk"">Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk</a> I consider it an excellent addition to the deck's <strong>RANK-4 Toolbox</strong> because in Modern Yugioh several decks have <strong>Follow Ups in GY</strong> such as Virtual World <a data-name=""Qinglong"">Qinglong</a>, Sky Striker <a data-name=""Engage!"">Engage!</a>, <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> among several other cards and Number 80 is a Double <a data-name=""D. D. Crow"">D. D. Crow</a> to deal with these problems. <a data-name=""Number 101: Silent Honor ARK"">Number 101: Silent Honor ARK</a> is one of my favorite XYZ RANK-4 in the game, it is the best way for you to threaten <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> because it protects itself from <strong>destruction by battle or card effect</strong> and its interaction effect is very good in Yugioh Modern, even more than at the time it was used in everything that is the game's deck in 2015 if I'm not mistaken it <strong>forced everyone to put Extra Deck Monsters in Defense</strong> but <strong>LINK Monsters can never play around this card</strong> so you can deal with cards like <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> made with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or attach as material a LINK Monster from <strong>Sky Striker</strong> like <a data-name=""Shizuku"">Shizuku</a> and <a data-name=""Raye"">Raye</a> won't come back from GY because <strong>Xyz material is not considered as a card that left the field</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// //  The XYZ RANK-4 <a data-name=""Light Dragon @Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"">Number 60: Dugares the Timeless</a> are cards that I recommend using if you have them in Master Duel and you can't craft some of the <strong>Xyz RANK-4 monsters I present in the Extra Deck</strong>. I don't even have all these Xyz in the Master Duel Extra Deck, but the ones I'm using in the Extra Deck are the <strong>ideal monsters to have in the Megalith deck</strong>. Of the Extra deck LINK monsters we have the ones that are mostly only <a data-name=""useful going first"">useful going first</a>: <a data-name=""Herald of Mirage Lights"">Herald of Mirage Lights</a> is what you do practically whenever possible going first and if the hand is really good you do <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> if you have <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> on hand. The <strong>Knightmare Link Monsters</strong> are cards to clear the opponent's field, especially <a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a> that surprised me in how efficient he was in several games where he dealt with problems before he even needed to make <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a>. <a data-name=""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"">Nephthys, the Sacred Flame</a> I saw that he was very redundant in games and I <strong>practically didn't use him</strong> because every match I could do I chose Knightmare Link to deal with problems in the opponent's field. But it's still a <strong>great win condition against Control decks</strong>.  <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Aratron"">Megalith Aratron</a>: I consider <a data-name=""Aratron"">Aratron</a> an unnecessary card in the deck <strong>unless you are using Block Dragon</strong> in the deck that adds the monsters needed for you to Ritual Summon on the opponent's turn with Aratron eff. One thing about <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> in Megalith deck is the synergy between <a data-name=""Megalith Unformed"">Megalith Unformed</a> and <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> with <strong>Level 8 Monsters</strong> be it <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Black Chaos MAX"">Black Chaos MAX</a> for example. This allows you to make excellent plays and even <strong>loop Black Chaos MAX with Megalith Phul and Megalith Portal</strong>. No wonder Block Dragon was excellent in the deck but I consider that the way the deck plays today is much <strong>more resilient to interactions and you use your resources much more efficiently</strong>.  <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> is a card that would be used in the Extra Deck to be sent to the GY by <a data-name=""Diviner of the Herald"">Diviner of the Herald</a> but as I already explained <a data-name=""Manju"">Manju</a> is better in the Megalith deck. <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> is a good Tech Card to use in your deck and can help you play around <a data-name=""Nibiru,"">Nibiru,</a> but I realized that it was <strong>Win More</strong> because if you got to the point of adding it to your hand it's because you're <strong>already winning the game </strong>and he was taking up a <strong>Hand Trap space</strong>. I thought he was good for being able to deny Nibiru but most of the times I took Nibiru playing with this deck I <strong>managed to extend plays and pass with the deck's standard field</strong> and there are times when you open with a weak combo and there's no way to play around Nibiru from no way so it makes no difference having the Herald of Orange Light on the decklist. <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> is a card that I recommend at least in <strong>Megalith side decks</strong> if they exist in Master Duel someday because it is searchable by <a data-name=""Cyber Angel Benten"">Cyber Angel Benten</a> and is good against many decks that ban cards to play.  <a data-name=""Extra-Foolish Burial"">Extra-Foolish Burial</a> is an interesting card if you use <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> and <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a> in Extra Deck because it does the <strong>same thing as Diviner of the Herald</strong> of sending those cards to the GY and becoming a Search of Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell or a pop of an opponent's card going second. But the <strong>main conflict of this card in the deck is</strong> the restriction of ""<strong>you can't set Spells/Traps during the turn that activates this card</strong>"" which means you can't set <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> which is one of the main spells/traps that the deck uses.  <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong>, it's just here for me to comment on some specific cards I'm not using in the decklist but they are common to see used in Megalith deck.  &nbsp;"

Try to set Marshmallon to the field facedown ASAP since it can not be destroyed by battle, also when flipped face up it inflicts 1000 damage to your enemy. Activate Marshmallon Glasses as soon as Marshmallon is flipped face up, thus making your opponent only able to attack Marshmallon while you have other monsters on the field, thus stalling your opponent. <strong>ALSO</strong> , try to activate Dark Snake Syndrome(DSS) ASAP to drain both each others life points to end the game quicker. While DSS is activated, try to summon Des Wombat, making your opponent the only person to take damage from DSS. Also, Marshmallon Glasses prevents your enemy from destroying Des Wombat. Your <strong>main</strong> 4 spell cards you need to play as soon as you draw them are Dark Snake Syndrome, Level Limit Area B, Wave Motion Cannon and Scapegoat. You are mostly going to be using your trap cards to inflict damage to your opponent and negate attacks if they destroy your spell cards. If you are going first on TURN 1 and drew ''Secret Barrel'' from your 5 cards, set it , and activate it (Secret Barrel) at the beginning of your opponents <strong>TURN 1-MAIN PHASE 1</strong> to instantly inflict 1200 damage to your opponent.  Be sure to use ''Poison of the Old Man'' to either instantly inflict 800 damage to your opponent or gain 1200 LP to your own LP. Great card to use since your are both losing LP every one of your stand-by phases  from DSS. <strong>Stall and burn, Stall and burn, STALL AND BURN!</strong>"

Treasure Panda here we go","EDIT: YGOProDeck claims Tune Warrior is a UR, but I guarantee you it's an N card on MD. Please also be aware this is exclusively for the N/R Festival and there's no point to playing this outside of it. Thanks!  I'm a jank deck player by heart, and while examining the N/R Master Duel event I noticed that it has a lot of the Exodia support cards and even every Forbidden One piece... except Exodia's head, which is SR. So there goes the whole strategy, right? ...Right?  This deck aims to take advantage of 3 cards, Treasure Panda, The Legendary Exodia Incarnate, and amusingly enough, ""Obliterate!"". Your main goal is to get Treasure Panda on the field through either summoning it or Giant Rat activation after you've put a few spell/traps in the GY, so you can then spam out either Exodia pieces or other Normal Monsters as tuners and whatnot to summon a variety of Extra Deck monsters. Treasure Panda also unlocks L.Ex.Inc.s in hand, who can otherwise be pretty nasty bricks, and lets you get a weird unaffected monster that can get reasonably large with support OR just loop Forbidden One cards back to hand every turn.  So why do you want to loop Forbidden One cards anyway? The answer is Obliterate!, which is actually really crazy in this format. See, people play Compulse in N/R format because it can end someone's turn in a flash and trades 1 for 1 with really big monsters your opponent minused to go into, or otherwise just disrupts people's turns at Quick-Play speed. So what if I told you that Exodia decks get to just play a card which Compulses the opponent EVERY TURN while Foolish Burialing at the same time? Obliterate! is the main way you can survive more proactive opponents' aggression, bouncing key cards like Heart-Earth Dragon or Megaliths halfway through their summon chains, and it doesn't set off destruction protections like a lot of other removal has to in this format. Even if your opponent blows it up, you can use the second effect to get back a Legendary Exodia Incarnate or something and then start going ham.  The rest of the deck is more or less designed to assist this plan. Exodius is a weird card that normally won't be doing a lot, but its biggest advantage is recycling your graveyard - he's a free special summon for Link Plays (or even Xyz summoning Ravenous Tarantula -&gt; The Seven Sins), and he gives you a full reload of Obliterate!, increases the length of your Giant Rat chains, turns Treasure Panda back on, and so forth. Hand Destruction is just one of the few ways to bin a lot of stuff so you have cards to banish to Panda, White Elephant's Gift combos nicely with Panda or Normal Monster decks in general, Tri-Wight gives you extension in the late game for last minute Extra Deck plays, and Gizmek Makami gives you a very late game option if you want to try to shuffle your banished Exodiuses back to start all over again.  The Normal Monster lineup looks a bit weird, but serves specific purposes. Flamvell Guardian is a level 1 tuner, so you can make a level 5 or 2 synchro with it fairly easily. Tune Warrior is one of the biggest options available to you and also a Tuner for going into PSY-Framelord Zeta, a very powerful piece of interaction. It also gives you an option for if you want to get 3 cards out of the GY to summon the Gizmek later. I've experimented with other stuff like Galaxy Serpent, but I think the nature of the available cards in the format makes this a reliable engine. Bunilla probably looks pretty strange, but it's an Earth you can summon off of Giant Rat in an emergency.  The trap lineup is a bit standard, although I think it could be better. Paleozoic Dinomischus is a mandatory staple for many decks in the format and given our lack of Spell/Trap removal it's even more important here as a multifaceted card that can make use of useless LEIs in the hand. Jelly Cannon was added as a means to get 1 for 1 trades that beat common protection in a deck that needs stuff to do its job and then be banishable by Panda. Torrential Tribute can win a game on its own and is particularly notable for not killing LEI due to its card effect protection, it also has interesting potential with a card in the Extra Deck. Compulsory is just another card that both acts as a Jelly Cannon effect and can reuse a Treasure Panda target that you have sitting around uselessly on the field.  The Extra Deck is by no means perfect and probably shouldn't be so varied, but it features a variety of options I enjoy. Let's start with the smallest set, the Xyzes. These are fairly self explanatory - Slacker Magician is a tolerable stall play, Lion Heart occasionally wins games through ""Burn BS"" and is not too hard to make with Treasure Panda, and Ravenous Tarantula + Seven Sins is a decent enough combo in a deck that occasionally gets both Exodius and LEI on the board with low attack stats or ends up with much lower LP than the opponent.  The Link Monsters are also fairly basic - Cross-Sheep, Geonator Transverser, and Berserker of the Tenyi are respectable format staples for just getting big man on the board or removing problem cards. You have 2 other types of monster in your deck so you can take advantage of Cross-Sheep's ATK modifying abilities. Powercode Talker is basically just a negate you can make in an emergency, but also is a good card if you can spam out enough Monsters because it can win combat by having something to tribute for once. Doublebyte Dragon I have never summoned but can think of scenarios where you'd really want it, so it's here just in case we need to beat over an annoying Xyz monster or something. Defender of the Labyrinth, finally, is pretty mediocre and probably shouldn't be here - but I love having an excuse to play it in a deck that might actually take advantage of it. You can summon Berserker of the Tenyi with this, you know!  The Synchros are where the most room for examination lies. Honestly, you could probably dump this part of the deck entirely if you wanted and just go for Link + Xyz spam, but I like several of these cards enough to keep them around. Puralis is simply a way to convert 2 Treasure Panda summons into a larger Tuner with a small effect, although we don't have a 6 to complete the combo with Panda itself, you can still Link it off or something for a coup de grace. Framelord Zeta is one of the most powerful cards in the deck and you could honestly try to make the list into Zeta turbo if you wanted by playing more copies + more Tune Warriors, I've gone ahead and stuck with one for now because I haven't made more. Crystron Anetrix is a weird option but as a generic 5 you can do much worse, it punishes opponents that play monsters with low defense and can even swing a game in certain contexts, having Summoned Skull ATK is quite appealing as well. The oddest choice in this deck is probably the twin Balmungs - many would rather run the Entity card that occasionally steals opponent's monsters. My reason for avoiding that is that I don't have any actual Spell/Trap destruction, so I don't have a good way to get rid of it and trigger its more impressive effect.  The real thing I like about Balmung, though, is that it's a non-once per turn card that doesn't rule out itself. In other words, if your opponent has some sort of aggressive destruction effect that repeats over and over, you can actually cycle through two Balmungs indefinitely so long as none of them are destroyed by Battle. Even better, Balmung on its own reborns all sorts of cards you particularly care about like Treasure Panda and Giant Rat, as well as your defensive normal monsters and tuners. Balmung doesn't even care who blew it up, so you can activate Torrential Tribute in response to your own summon to wipe the board and get a card back. Isn't that cool? I think a truly better version of the deck would probably replace Balmung with the Entity and then a summonable 6 for Puralis lines, but I don't think this version is too troublesome.  I would say that the main things this deck is looking for if you want to try to improve it are ways to get cards into the graveyard faster and ways to protect Treasure Panda. Unfortunately, there are no generic level 11 or 12 Synchros in N/R format, so it's impossible to use the Exodias and our Tuners to make Star Eaters or something. A version of this deck focused exclusively on Link spamming with a small Rank 10 package could work, but I like some of the options Synchros offer in a deck that makes Cross-Sheep regularly, so it's really up to personal taste.  The most cuttable parts of the deck right now are probably Exodius, the Gizmek, and some of the traps. Gizmek doesn't work very well because the big Exodias don't have the same ATK as DEF, so it's exclusively a way to give an already slow deck a longer grind game. Exodius is tolerable and serves an important niche but is also usually relatively useless - perhaps if there were more monsters with GY effects in the deck he'd be a better roleplayer (did you know he bins effect monsters and not just the Normals he counts? I forget lol but I guess it makes sense if he needs to send the head). Hand Destruction is ok but I can't help but feel like there's more spell/traps that cycle through the deck I'm not finding. Nevertheless, I've had a reasonably enjoyable time seeing this deck actually do something, even if it's occasionally an agonizing stallfest of sitting under Obliterate as you bounce a card every turn until you draw something relevant. Overall, I'd say play this if you think Exodialess Exodia is funny, and to make people misplay trying to stop you from assembling all 5 in hand because they don't know the head is banned!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Especially considering it was made at a whim off of a random combo line idea lol. Starting off, I do not think this is a ""rogue"" strategy at all, this deck is only amazing in BO1 going first, otherwise known as MD format, for this to be a rogue deck it would actually need to be able to survive a single Ash Blossom. The deck falls off in a BO3 with no real good board breakers or combos going second that can survive any somewhat competent board. You could probably win a small event with less people who only play meta decks, I suppose. Unfortunately this deck has no real 1-2 card combo's that don't lead to ending your turn if you get interrupted by a hand-trap. I would love to play Utopia at a meta level, but Konami typically prefers to keep casual and meta archetypes separate. Not gonna call it a Fun/Casual deck either, not much ""fun"" when you get Kali Yuga'd turn 1. This deck is more of an experiment with Utopia, to see what could it do at peak performance and no interruptions. The deck is built for more of an environment where you might run into some meta decks that play a more consistent number of handtraps, but you can remove them to make room for more consistency boosters like <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin, or more copies of </a><a data-name=""Astraltopia"">Astraltopia</a>, <a data-name=""Zexal Field"">Zexal Field</a> and potentially a <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> if you want to. For the most part the only non-typical Utopia deck card in the Main Deck is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch. The extra deck has been of altered from a typical Utopia deck of course, to fit the Kali Yuga package of </a><a data-name=""D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga"">D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">, </a><a data-name=""Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker"">Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch""> (or </a><a data-name=""Number 11: Big Eye"">Number 11: Big Eye</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">, just needs to be a Rank 7 Dark Number XYZ), </a><a data-name=""Number 71: Rebarian Shark"">Number 71: Rebarian Shark</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">, and </a><a data-name=""Number 56: Gold Rat"">Number 56: Gold Rat</a><a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">.</a>  This deck uses the Onomat engine to get to the three main Onomat cards used in a normal utopia full combo, as well as using <a data-name=""ZS - Ascended Sage"">ZS - Ascended Sage</a> + Astraltopia to get to the same combo.  The first few ""pre-combos"" funnel you into the main combo.  Bricks/Garnets are Double or Nothing, and either of the 2 ZW's. Drawing any of the combo pieces you intend to search, like Zexal Field or any of the Rank-Up-Magic cards can be bad in some situations but the combos are simple enough to adapt based on what you drew in your starting hand.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  PRE-COMBO 1:  Onomatopaira + Any 1 Onomat monster + Any 1 Random Card  Onomatopaira searching the 2 Onomats you don't have in hand discarding 1 random card.  PRE-COMBO 2:  Onomatopickup + Onomatopaira + Any 1 Random Cards  Onomatopickup to search Utopic Onomatopeia, Paira to search the remaining 2 discarding the random card  MAIN COMBO 1:  Summon Utopic Onomatopeia  Use Utopic Eff to summon the other two Onomats  Using Utopic and Bancho summon Utopic Sage  Utopic Sage eff summon Ascended Sage  Use Bancho to summon back Utopic Ono  Use Glove effect in GY to SS back on field  Use the three Onomats to summon Primathmech, activating its optional effect on summon to search for Astraltopia  Summon Astraltopia using it's effect  Use Sage and Primathmech to make Utopic Future and then Utopic Draco Future  Use Astraltopia effect either sending Onomatopickup if you went that precombo route, or a random card in hand to GY, searching Zexal Field. If you have Zexal Field, search out Numbers Protection for an additional omni-negate if you for some reason need it on your next turn after you Kali Yuga them.  Activate Zexal Field  Use Astraltopia and Ascended Sage to make Utopia Double.  Activate Utopia Double's optional effect, and Zexal Field's effect in that order. There's no particular reason to order it in way to chain block since at this point you would have been interrupted at this point if they had anything. DO NOT CHAIN UTOPIA DOUBLE's EFFECT YET. Attach Rebarian Shark and search Hyper Rank Up Magic.  Use Utopia Double's effect to summon Utopia.  Use Utopia to summon Utopia Prime.  Use Hyper Rank Up Magic to summon Dragonar, I recommend summoning in defense to avoid lightning storm.  Activate Dragonar's effect, make sure to detach Rebarian Shark, to summon Gold Rat.  Activate Hyper Rank Up Magic's optional GY effect  Activate Rebraian Shark's GY effect to put Phantom Knights' Rank up on the top of the deck  Use Gold Rat's effect to draw one, and return any other card in hand.  Set Phantom Knights' Rank Up (and Numbers Protection if you have it)  In the draw phase, use Dragonar to summon your choice of Rank 7 Dark Attribute Number (Big Eye or Mind Hacker, I went with Mind Hacker for aesthetic).  I recommend summoning it in defense to avoid lightning storm.  DO NOT ACTIVATE HYPER RANK UP MAGIC's OPTIONAL EFFECT.  The first moment you can chain Phantom Knights' Rank Up, Zexal Field will make it in-respondable, ensuring Kali Yuga will hit the board.  I recommend waiting until they either attempt to activate Droplet, Imperm or any form of a negate/board breaker, to circumvent them attempting to chain to Kali Yuga's on summon effect.  During the end phase I would recommend activating Kali Yuga's effect to clear the board of any spell and trap cards on the field, this will include your set numbers protect, so if you wish save numbers protect until your turn and then Kali Yuga after you've used it.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  COMBO 2:  ZS - Ascended Sage + Astraltopia + Any 1 Random Card  Special Summon Ascended Sage  Normal Summon Astraltopia  Use Astraltopia, discarding 1 random card to search Zexal Field  Activate Zexal Field  Use Astraltopia and Ascended Sage to make Utopia Double.  Activate Utopia Double's optional effect, and Zexal Field's effect in that order. There's no particular reason to order it in way to chain block since at this point you would have been interrupted at this point if they had anything. DO NOT CHAIN UTOPIA DOUBLE's EFFECT YET. Attach Rebarian Shark and search Hyper Rank Up Magic.  Use Utopia Double's effect to summon Utopia.  Use Utopia to summon Utopia Prime.  Use Hyper Rank Up Magic to summon Dragonar, I recommend summoning in defense to avoid lightning storm.  Activate Dragonar's effect, make sure to detach Rebarian Shark, to summon Gold Rat.  Activate Hyper Rank Up Magic's optional GY effect  Activate Rebraian Shark's GY effect to put Phantom Knights' Rank up on the top of the deck  Use Gold Rat's effect to draw one, and return any other card in hand.  Set Phantom Knights' Rank Up (and Numbers Protection if you have it)  In the draw phase, use Dragonar to summon your choice of Rank 7 Dark Attribute Number (Big Eye or Mind Hacker, I went with Mind Hacker for aesthetic).  I recommend summoning it in defense to avoid lightning storm.  DO NOT ACTIVATE HYPER RANK UP MAGIC's OPTIONAL EFFECT.  The first moment you can chain Phantom Knights' Rank Up, Zexal Field will make it in-respondable, ensuring Kali Yuga will hit the board.  I recommend waiting until they either attempt to activate Droplet, Imperm or any form of a negate/board breaker, to circumvent them attempting to chain to Kali Yuga's on summon effect.  During the end phase I would recommend activating Kali Yuga's effect to clear the board of any spell and trap cards on the field, this will include your set numbers protect, so if you wish save numbers protect until your turn and then Kali Yuga after you've used it.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  Additional Info:  So you may notice that the side deck is literally the entire Numeron Package. Utopia is unfortunately kind of... bad going second for the most part. Paira will most likely be negated if they have a spell negate set up, Ascended search will be negated most likely and odds are you don't have lethal if you some how make it through all the negates and make something like Utopia Double OTK combo, which is a 10k beat stick basically will almost certainly not kill them if they do not have any monster out with 2k atk. Numeron Package is basically just... dome them in the most cheap way possible through what they have setup, they most likely will not be prepared for it depending on how many negates they have. While not listed you can theoretically include the Scythe Package of 2 Artifact Sanctum and 1 Artifact Scythe in there as well if you really want to be """"""meta"""""".  There is not any particularly any other amazing targets to go into, though there is one target if you're playing MD, which is er uh, VFD using Number 23 as base material. Number 23 allows you to activate Hyper Rank Up's GY effect giving you one omni negate before going into VFD if ya nasty like that.  I highly recommend reading this deck list:  https://ygoprodeck.com/utopia-master-duel-feb22/  This decklist goes through all the real combos this deck can do that aren't a little bit toxic, and is overall an amazing decklist, I think it's one of, if not the best Utopia decklists available online, though don't just copy and paste and call it a day, experiment to your liking.  The deck is currently made to allow for alternate combo's in case of brick, though you could most certainly edit it to be more consistent with the kali yuga combo, Utopia is not brick proof due to the high investment combos, so I do not recommend trying to replace all the side combo lines just to Kali Yuga turbo slightly more consistently, but potentially brick more.  This is not the only Utopia deck of this caliber that I have but it is the one that is most refined, and most consistent of the bunch due to the 6 searchers and 9 Onomat count in main deck. The other combo is Scythe Control Utopia, which I'm not particularly proud of, very reliant on drawing Sky Striker Engage (yes its a utopia deck with link monsters) or just hard drawing scythe or the artifact trap card. Extremely hard to optimize since it goes out of its way off the main combo route to do that.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  Cut-able/Swap-able Cards:  Zexal Construction:  VERY easy to cut out of the deck and replace with any other card you feel you need more of. An inherent minus one, but can unbrick your hand as a result of it.  ZW cards:  In the main kali yuga combo drawing the ZW's can be bricky, if you want to still keep one in case you need to go into leo ray, keep Pegasus Twin Saber.  Double or Nothing:  So this one is much more tricky, you don't need double or nothing to do the main combo, since you detach rebarian shark with dragonar, but this is also for the less optimal hands where you can only go into leo ray potentially. This is the second most cut-able card if you feel like the deck is consistent enough for you to not need the double lines. Combo would basically be the same but you hard summon Utopia instead of summoning it with Utopia Double.  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  Final thoughts:  I've loved Utopia since I was a kid, was my first structure deck and everything so I keep trying to keep this deck even vaguely relevant in this day and age, especially since Lyril Tri doesn't summon UDF anymore so I don't really get to use any utopia cards if I play a meta deck. Overall this deck can let you compete against some meta decks if they don't have any meaningful interaction, or if you somehow have enough to push through them and win still. I don't expect to see Utopia ever top a real tournament despite some lists on this site calling this deck ""rogue"" or ""meta"" because they beat the people at their locals who don't have meta decks at the top level. Have fun with this deck and let me know if you think there's any potential cards to add or change to boost its consistency that bit more without just ruining the core identity of the deck. If you want to do this consistently, I think Phantom Knights can still do this but I honestly have no idea to be honest."

Its effect is the best among the three mini bears since it allows you to add more options to your existing hands.</li>  	<li><strong>Miktanus</strong> will be the one to recycle the Ursarctic bears you need once you've filled up GY with bears used as tributes/materials for Polari summoning process. Primary target of Polari revival effect.</li>  	<li><strong>Mikbilis</strong> will be the least desired mini bear to be used, but is a good summon/revival target for swarming or triggering Radiation's effect.</li>  	<li>The level 8 mega bears are the Tuner and work as main handtrap of the deck, which <em>enable you to disrupt your opponent with their effects during their main phase.</em></li>  	<li><strong>Megatanus'</strong> pseudo Book of Moon effect is the one that you'll frequently use, as flipping face-down opponent's starter monster is often an effective way to halt their combo.</li>  	<li>The effectiveness of <strong>Megabilis</strong> D.D. Crow-like banish effect varies depending on your opponent's deck, as banishing opponent's key combo piece could be a great loss for them. Also works as huge beatstick with its highest ATK among the mega bears.</li>  	<li><strong>Megapolar's</strong> MST-like single backrow destruction is a nice utility. But considering the capability of other package/monsters in the deck, this mega bear's effect will be less likely used.</li>  	<li>It is optimal to have 1-2 mega bears in your hand ready at the end of the turn so that you can play them during opponent's turn as needed.</li>  	<li>I keep <strong>Big Dipper</strong> at 1 copy for reasons: 1) It is a potential brick, since you'll prefer to have it searched by Polari's effect, 2) It is recycle-able by Radiation, unless it's banished.</li>  	<li><strong>Departure</strong> is a decent searcher card that keeps your hand stocked with the bears. To avoid potential loss, it is advised to only use it after baiting opponent's ash/negates by starting out using other search effect first, such as Mikpolar or Crystal Girl.</li>  	<li><strong>Radiation</strong> allows you to offset the tribute costs that the bears used by its (potential) 7 draws. It will also allows you to: 1) Dig further into the deck as you summon the bears, gaining either more tribute fodders or other combo lines' pieces 2) Chain-blocking Ursarctic monster search effects by its triggered effect as Chain-2, thus protecting Mikpolar/Polari's effect (that's activated as Chain-1) from Ash Blossom interference.</li>  	<li><em><strong>D</strong><strong>o not be tempted and extend your play too much that you're using up Radiation's 7 draws just in one turn</strong></em>; having to draw 2-3 times per turn from its effect is usually enough to replenish your hand resources for the turn.</li>  	<li>Radiation's GY recycling effect can be used to remove and recycle duplicate bears from the GY, thus avoiding interference from Called by the Grave's effect.</li>  	<li><strong>Slider</strong> works either as: 1) Nice extender if you're lacking of playable bears and tributes, 2) As additional disruption once you've piled up GY or banished cards. Its main selling point is the ability to revive banished face-up bears, thus allowing you to banish the bears in GY (from Big Dipper effect) without worry and access them later on.</li>  	<li><em><strong>Instead of rushing to climb into the level 7 synchro bears on the starting turn, I think it may be better to keep Polari on field to start off.</strong></em> Its recycling/revival effect can be used on later turns if it survived next opponent's turn, and it alone satisfies the requirement to activate Big Dipper's monster-stealing effect. Having it destroyed also won't be large loss unlike getting level 7 synchro bears that you rushed to summon being destroyed instead.</li>  	<li>With <strong>Quint Charge,</strong> you can take opponent by surprise during their turn by summoning appropriate level 7 synchro bears using the available Polari and mega bears. It also serves as backup option to recover some bears in GY, thus preserving the deck's resources especially in late-game. You'll prefer to get this trap later on and not in the starting hand, thus its status as the package's garnet.</li>  	<li><strong>Grand Chariot</strong> is a good candidate for this Quint Charge summon effect since destroy 2 effect during opponent's turn is quite beneficial/fatal. Else, you can prioritize summoning it if you'd like to protect Big Dipper from any targeting removal.</li>  	<li><strong>Septentrion</strong> is the main selling of the archetype (for most people) since it's able to lock out Xyz or Link-based decks. It is better summoned once you've recognized what deck opponent is playing. The search effect is a good additional effect that lets you adapt to opponent's move in their turn, either by: 1) Getting a mega bear for disruption, 2) Preparing a recovery option through Departure.</li> </ul> <span>-- Melffy/Beasts package --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Catty</strong> will be the main part of the package, since it's able to fetch various cards from your deck, mainly: level 7 mini bears, <strong>Bigfoot, Alpha, Kerass,</strong> and <strong>Hop Ear.</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong> is the key that gives level 7 mini bears another utility as Synchro material. It enables you to gain access to level 9 Synchro monsters during opponent's turn, which are able to create powerful disruption (see more in Level 9 Synchro monsters section). Getting level 10 Synchro monsters using Hop Ear is also possible, but it's very less likely to happen compared to summoning level 9 Synchro monsters.</li> </ul> <span>-- Danger! package --</span> <ul>  	<li>Even though their effect won't activate from being tributed for the bears' summoning cost, the deck has enough discard effects that can make use of the package's potential: Departure and Ravenous Crocodragon.</li>  	<li><strong>Nessie's</strong> useful mostly for preserving hand advantage by getting Bigfoot on your hand. If Nessie is summoned to the field, it can be used alongside level 8 mega bears to call Polari as the level 7 material.</li>  	<li><strong>Bigfoot's</strong> destruction effect is pretty much self-explanatory.</li>  	<li>The package's ""random self discard, then draw 1 if it isn't discarded"" effect may prove useful to unbrick unplayable hand. However, since it depends mostly on luck for both random discard and one draw, you're not guaranteed to get a good result from it.</li> </ul> <span>-- Swordsoul/Wyrm package --</span> <ul>  	<li>The main reason it is included in the deck to get easier access to level 10 Synchro monster, especially <strong>Qixing Longyuan </strong>as going first play. Without the package, the deck can reliable enough to get into level 10 Synchro by using level 8 mega bears with increased amount of level 2 monsters.</li>  	<li><strong>Bixi</strong> enables you to access Qixing Longyuan by using up your normal summon and one level 8 mega bear on field.</li>  	<li><strong>Longyuan</strong> can turn another copy of itself or other Wyrm monster as an easy access to level 10 Synchro monsters.</li>  	<li><strong>Chengying</strong> is pretty much the most powerful and reliable boss monster available for the deck. Combined with Big Dipper/Departure GY banish effect (for substituting bears' tribute cost) or Megabilis' GY banish, you can trigger Chengying's removal effect easily.</li>  	<li><strong>Qixing Longyuan</strong> is a good boss monster to have in turn 1. Its immediate banish effect may prove useful to disrupt opponent's starting play if they're going second.</li>  	<li><strong>Vishuda</strong> fits really well with this package while serving as eligible Ursarctic tribute cost. With the presence of normal monster (Swordsoul token or Monk of the Tenyi), its bounce effect adds more option to chip away opponent's board. Being able to be summoned instantly from hand if there's no effect monsters on field, Vishuda can be a good optional starting point to get into Polari thus making it less of a brick.</li>  	<li><strong>Monk of the Tenyi</strong> enables you to use Vishuda's effect without needing to wait for Longyuan's Swordsoul token, thus making the three copies of Vishuda as a consistent going second card option.</li>  	<li><strong>Longyuan</strong> in the hand can possibly become quite a brick, sadly. It really needs another Wyrm in hands to activate, and being level 6 makes it not legible as Ursarctic tribute cost. If there's no way that you'll draw another Wyrm monster soon enough (such as by betting on Radiation's draw effect), you can use it for discard fodder whenever possible, instead.</li>  	<li>If you don't feel like playing this package, you can take it out from the deck and replace it with alternatives (refer to alternatives section below).</li> </ul> <span>-- Going 2nd cards --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Gameciel</strong> pretty much does what people expect from Kaijus: removal by tribute. Being a water attribute monster enables it to be searched by Crystal Girl. Else, a tribute fodder for the bears.</li>  	<li>With its quick effect, <strong>Pankratops</strong> enables the deck to: 1) Have better way to break a bit of opponent's complete turn 1 board, 2) Protecting your combo play by pressuring your opponent by its chainable effect. Same as Nessie, being a level 7 makes it a good material to summon Polari (although you'll prefer to use it more for its removal effect). If you're going first, it can serves as tribute fodder for the bears, instead.</li>  	<li><strong>Alpha</strong> fits well with the deck mostly because of Melffy package; It is searchable by Catty as I've mentioned before. Once it is used for its bouncing effect, you can tribute it to proceed on Ursarctic line of combo.</li>  	<li><strong>Eldlich</strong> has unique roles in this deck: 1) Even though the chance of happening is low, Eldlich enables you to make use of other copies of Departure or Radiation that is bricking your hand, 2) Non-ED easy access to high ATK monster, as long as you can sacrifice one of your available spell/trap cards. Keep in note that its high level count isn't compatible to be used as Synchro material.</li> </ul> <span>-- Tri-Brigade package --</span> <ul>  	<li>Tri-Brigade package will be mostly used as late-game strategy, considering the GY is likely to be filled up with enough materials at that time (Ursarctic, Melffy, Hop Ear, Bigfoot).</li>  	<li>Considering<strong><em> Ursarctic monsters lock out monsters without levels because of their summoning condition</em></strong> and the package doesn't include other Tri-Brigade main deck monsters to fuel the GY early on (since they'll most likely to be brick), <em>the package is unable to function in turn 1.</em></li>  	<li>Since <strong>Kerass</strong> fits the requirement to be searched by Catty and can easily special summon itself, it is more preferred compared to his fellow Nervall and Kitt. Other than being used for its Link summoning capability, being a level 2 makes it compatible with level 8 mega bears as Synchro material. Considered to be a garnet you don't want to see in your opening hand.</li>  	<li><strong>Shuraig's</strong> banish effect can be triggered by any Ursarctic or Hop Ear's quick summoning effect, so you can take advantage of it during opponent's turn as long as you have enough resource to do so.</li> </ul> <span>-- Level 9 Synchro monsters --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Shenshen</strong> that's summoned during opponent's turn is pretty much a powerful GY lock move, effective especially against GY-reliant strategy/decks. Since the deck contains enough diversity of types and attributes, you can easily revive Shenshen on later turns (such as banishing Hop Ear or Bigfoot with any mega bears). The primary target for its recycle effect is <strong>Crystal Girl,</strong> which enables you to revive it again and triggers its search effect after special summoned.</li>  	<li><strong>Ravenous Crocodragon</strong> fits well with the deck. Its draw effect on summon at least relieves our hand resource a bit, while the discard -&gt; destroy effect is able to make use the Danger! package and any bricks that are clogging the hands. Once it lived out its usefulness, you can use it alongside level 8 mega bears to bring out Polari.</li>  	<li><strong>Stellar Wind Wolfrayet</strong> is another decent pick for level 9 Synchro monsters roster. Its field-wide, non-destruction monster removal effect is sure powerful and gives similar pressure as Big Dipper, but easy for the opponent to play around. It is also noticeably lack of removal protection, thus having Almiraj is recommended if you're planning to get it on the field.</li> </ul> <span>-- Other cards --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Crystal Girl</strong> is one of the most desired starters beside Mikpolar. Use its on-summon search effect to: 1) Getting level 8 mega bears ready for next turn, 2) Add Gameciel for later turns usage, 3) Bait out Ash Blossom from confused/inexperienced first-time opponents. It also enables you to access level 9 Synchro monsters by using it as materials alongside level 8 mega bears. Since it has revival effect (which requirement is pretty easy as long as you have any bears or Ravenous Crocodragon on field), you can send it to GY by using it as discard fodder (especially for Departure). In doing so, you can use normal summon of that turn for something else.</li>  	<li><strong>Pot of Desires</strong> should've not be limited due to its usefulness for the deck. It pretty much gives the deck lots of advantage: 1) +2 new cards in hands for further play, 2) Thinning out the deck once you've got all important pieces like Big Dipper on field/hand/GY, 3) Powering up Chengying by a mile. It is advisable to use it after you've activated Big Dipper on the field, as it'll be detrimental having the only one important field spell banished accidentally, unable to be salvaged.</li>  	<li><strong>Monster Reborn</strong> works well as extender and recovery option. Keep in mind that Ursarctic ED monsters can't be special summoned using this, thus making the other ED monsters as more suitable revival target.</li>  	<li><strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> pretty much has similar pressuring GY lockout role like Shenshen, while also offering one-time omni negate. <em>(Considering recent changes of the deck recipe where Melffy Puppy and Kalantosa are removed, it'll be quite hard and less consistent to summon this monster.</em> <em>It is recommended to add those monsters if you'd like to add more consistency on summoning this monster.)</em></li>  	<li><strong>Almiraj</strong> pretty much slightly covers the deck's lack of protection from destroy effect. Be aware that you can't summon it after Ursarctic monsters have summoned themselves and locked out the ED. Thus, the best time to summon Almiraj is after normal summoning Crystal Girl from your starting play.</li>  	<li><strong>Trishula Zero</strong> is a pretty nice accessible surprise that can be made by the deck, although it won't appear very often. It is usually summoned by using level 8 mega bears, any level 2 monster, and Crystal Girl (which usually just revived itself). Since it'll be a waste to not make use of its last effect, I decided to include normal <strong>Trishula</strong> to take advantage of it. Normal Trishula is nigh impossible to summon beside using Trishula Zero effect, thus eating up one of important ED slots.</li> </ul> <span>-- Alternatives --</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Melffy Puppy</strong> can be used as the another copy of <strong>Catty.</strong> Having it alongside Catty on the field is also useful to ensure Catty search effect not being negated by Ash Blossom, since you can make a chain block of Catty &gt; Puppy. Add <strong>Kalantosa</strong> alongside Puppy if you'd like another form of sudden disruption, but keep in mind of their status as potential brick.</li>  	<li><strong>Melffy Fenny</strong> is a niche one; it enables you to summon level 7 mini bears during opponent's turn even though you're not having level 7+ monsters as eligible tribute.</li>  	<li><strong>Ancient Warriors - Loyal Guan Yun</strong> is a good budget pick for going 2nd card, which covers up similar role as Pankratops (but worse). Being a Beast-Warrior type also synergetic as Tri-Brigade GY link fodder. 2 copies at most.</li>  	<li><strong>Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju</strong> can be an alternative to replace Gameciel if you'd like to anticipate facing wind barrier statue lock.</li>  	<li><strong>Tri-Brigade Nervall</strong> is a good normal summon candidate, which can also be used for Synchro materials/discard fodder while it triggers the search effect to fetch Kerass to your hand. 1-2 may be quite enough.</li>  	<li><strong>Ultimate Flagship Ursatron </strong>may give you more option on handling Ursarctic-based resources. However, its lack of protection and the complications you'll need to get through to summon it don't justify its usage. The best way to summon Ursatron is probably by using Quint Charge, but you'll need to give up one Polari on the field as a cost and the summoning method is considerably slow due to Quint Charge status as a trap card. Using <strong>Drytron Fafnir</strong> + <strong>Ursarctic Drytron</strong> sounds nice, but having to run additional bricks/garnets while also using Big Dipper on field as material (which have more impactful effects) are quite risky choice.</li>  	<li><strong>Linkuriboh</strong> for people who prefers battle protection instead of Almiraj's.</li>  	<li><b>Hraesvelgr </b>is a good summon target for Tri-Brigade package if you don't have enough materials in GY, or if you'd like to use its effect before climbing with Kerass into Link-4.</li>  	<li><strong>Accesscode Talker</strong> is an alternative Link-4 to climb after summoning Hraesvelgr by using Kerass. Potentially a better finisher compared to Shuraig. For ones with enough money or Master Duel players.</li>  	<li><strong>Baronne de Fleur</strong> is self-explanatory. Again, for ones with enough money or Master Duel players.</li>  	<li><strong>Vermillion Dragon Mech</strong> is a nice alternative if you don't like Ravenous Crocodragon's steep discard cost. The easily paid cheap cost for the destruction effect is nice, but since it's not a quick effect and the recycle effect can only trigger if this card is destroyed by card effect... I feel that Ravenous Crocodragon is a more flexible and rewarding option.</li>  	<li><strong>Geomathmech Final Sigma</strong> is a good option if you feel like having a near-invincible boss monster. However, it lacks of good effects on field beside from being a large beatstick and using level 10 Synchro monster (that has more utility) as material is not justified.</li>  	<li><strong>Trade-In</strong> and <strong>Sacred Sword of Seven Stars</strong> can be used as additional draw engines. Trade-In is able to trigger Bigfoot's effect, while Sacred Sword is able to make use of unused level 7 monsters. Keep in mind that you'll need to slot in large amount of monsters with appropriate level, and these two will be a fatal brick if other stuffs in the hand don't match well (especially with Melffy package). It is also prone to Ash Blossom and other negations, leaving you with less hands than it used to be. Recommended to only insert 1-2 copies total.</li>  	<li><strong>Foolish Burial Goods</strong> can be combined with a copy of Ursarctic Drytron to make a substitute tribute cost in GY that works similarly like Departure. The substitution effect can be used immediately after being sent to the GY, which is the combo's only superiority compared to Departure. It is better to use the slots for additional level 7+ monsters (especially going 2nd cards), since those monsters may have more utility while also serve as tributes for the bears.</li>  	<li><strong>Heavenly Zephyr - Miradora</strong> and <strong>Bahalutiya, the Grand Radiance</strong> seem to be a nice additional handtrap beside level 8 mega bears. After some testing, I felt that their effect is too mediocre and their summoning/activation condition is too inconsistent, making them end up only as tribute fodder most of the time. Thus, their niche status. Only slot them in if you think they're cool.</li>  	<li>Unlike the fellow dragons above, <strong>Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay</strong> have a decent draw effect to refresh available options in your hands. Keep in mind that its summoning condition requires your opponent to play Link-based deck, which limits its usage.</li>  	<li><strong>Popular handtraps</strong> (Ash Blossom, Ghost Ogre, Effect Veiler) and <strong>generic staples</strong> (Called by the Grave, Infinite Impermanence, Dark Ruler No More!) can be used to replace going 2nd cards and Swordsoul package if you're more inclined to use their powerful effect. In exchange, adding them may hit the consistency of having enough Ursarctic tribute fodders due to higher ratio of lower level monsters and spell/trap cards, thus requiring you to tweak the deck's card ratio further. Recommended for current Master Duel builds or people with enough money irl.</li>  	<li>For further customization, you can increase the amount of these following cards by max. 1 copy by also replacing some cards/package you find redundant: <strong>Crystal Girl, Catty, Alpha, Gameciel, Vishuda, Eldlich,</strong> <strong>Big Dipper, Quint Charge, Desires (if the banlist allows), Bigfoot, Nessie, Hop Ear, Kerass, Chengying, Shuraig, Ravenous Crocodragon.</strong></li> </ul> <span>-- Gameplan --</span>  -- Early Game -- <ul>  	<li>Normal summoning Crystal Girl to start is the best opening move to bait out Ash/negations. Then, immediately use it as a Link material for Almiraj.</li>  	<li>Starting the turn by summoning Vishuda for free is another good opening move. From there, you can: 1) Get into Monk of the Tenyi if you're going second and want to chip away opponent's board using the bounce effect, 2) Summon a mega bear and use Vishuda alongside it to start the Ursarctic combo line by summoning Polari.</li>  	<li><strong><em>The base philosophy of the deck to make its first opening board is to keep it humble in appearance, while you have resources ready in hands and GY.</em></strong> For the field, have at least Polari and/or a level 7 mini bear alongside one other usable monsters (Catty, Ravenous Crocodragon, Qixing Longyuan). As for the hands and GY, make sure you have some quick effects or handtraps ready (level 8 mega bears, Hop Ear, Bigfoot for discard cost, Departure in GY for tribute cost, any bears as Slider's target).</li>  	<li>It is recommended to prioritize summoning Polari + set up Big Dipper in this first turn if you're confident on able to pull off without getting interrupted or having backup plays/extender in hands.</li>  	<li>Use Polari's effect to do one of these setups to finish the turn: 1) Revive one level 7 mini bear whose effect hasn't been used yet 2) Retrieve a level 8 mega bear to the hand 3) Revive a level 8 mega bear and use it to get into level 9/10 Synchro monster.</li>  	<li>If you're going second and have enough cards to summon and activate level 8 mega bears, it is a good idea to use them as soon as possible for interruption during opponent's first turn/opening play. Else, rely on going second cards if you have them.</li>  	<li>Trishula Zero's banish 3 effect is a decent option as last resort in attempt to break opponent's board.</li> </ul> -- Mid Game -- <ul>  	<li>Once you've found out what strategy opponent deck is using, use the ED monsters to deal with each case accordingly.</li>  	<li>Most of Level 9 Synchro monsters are better summoned during opponent's turn. Use their effects to remove opponent's key combo pieces or bring major disruption.</li>  	<li>Bringing out Chengying alongside Polari + Big Dipper is a good move to put pressure on opponent; Big Dipper's ticking counters and Chengying's banish effect will be annoying threats for opponent to deal with on following turns.</li>  	<li>Keep in mind to at least have enough stock of Ursarctic monsters and their fodder in hand (or GY if Big Dipper is active).</li>  	<li>Bring out Septentrion as soon as possible if opponent's cards indicate they're mainly using Xyz or Link strategy.</li> </ul> -- Late Game -- <ul>  	<li>Almost similar to Mid Game, but you'll rely on the byproduct from previous turns in the GY.</li>  	<li>Shensen revival should be easy to do once you've used up bunch of different cards; Keep the opponent pressured with its continuous banish effect.</li>  	<li>Tri-Brigade package can be a good last push to remove the remaining threat. Keep in mind to make it as the first play of the turn, since you'll be locked off from using this package after you summon any Ursarctic monsters from hand.</li>  	<li>Late game Chengying is a powerful finisher, especially after you've banished enough cards from previous turns.</li> </ul> -- Afterwords --  This deck recipe is my attempt to salvage the unique Ursarctic archetype by inserting bunch of happy accidental synergies, which do really help the archetype much by adding several layers of alternate gameplans. Even though the initial flaw of Ursarctic at its core still presents and limits the deck from reaching competitive-tier power level, I think I did my best to make the deck fun to use. I recommend you to use and try the deck in non-meta or casual play, especially if you're aiming to have fun, back and forth interactions.  Really, with all these non-Ursarctic cards, it does really feel like being an anime protagonist that can pull off new unpredictable strategies in every fight... Of course, not counting the brick rate and such.  Thank you for reading this far if you did. Again, please do try out the deck and comments with your test result for future considerations and update!  (Updated: Bumped up deck count to 44, removed 49-cards deck option. Tweaked the number of copies for cards in Melffy and Swordsoul package. Replaced one Ravenous Crocodragon with Wolfrayet in ED. Added Monk of Tenyi as main ED monster alongside write-up of its influence. Cleaned up some writings. Added Eldlich.)"

This Deck is fun to play and battle your opponent's strongest decks.  This Deck comprises Elemental Heroes, Vision Heroes, and Destiny Heroes. The main objective is to summon your Elemental and Destiny Fusion Monsters for the strongest effects and High Attack power.  The only weakness this Deck has is against negate cards since Heroes by themselves don't have to negate effects, and very few of them have counter to monster negation tactics. Still, this is a good competitive deck against decks in the Silver and Gold ranking.  I also added a few support cards if you plan on using Destiny Hero Plasma which is a great card to play when going first as he negates your opponent's monster effects, and with D - Force, he is an unstoppable beast."

Its pretty good and I won a local tournament with it a few weeks ago. If you think it could be better tell me i would love to im,"This is a hero deck I spent a year working on. I've only gotten a hand that I couldn't play once. Even with that hand I could negate them from doing anything.  With this deck you could get a bad hand and still do something to help you win.  The best board I've was able to make would and the  best board for this deck would be with <strong>Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</strong>, <strong>Masked HERO Dark Law, Evil HERO Malicious Bane</strong> you can do so much to win and if you can also add <b>Vision HERO Trinity </b>to that board that's game every time. Because <strong>Masked HERO Dark Law </strong>get them away from graveyard effects and just messes with there graveyard in general and, with <b>Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer </b>send it to the gave plus an opponent card you can do some major damage to your opponent. Then when you add <strong>Evil HERO Malicious Bane </strong>You can destroy all monsters your opponent controls with ATK less than or equal to <strong>Evil HERO Malicious Bane</strong>, also it gains 200 ATK for each monster destroyed that way. plus if you can get <b>Vision HERO Trinity </b>out whos ATK doubles making it 5,000 ATK.  If you don't have / cant afford <strong>Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer </strong>or <strong>Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier </strong>then you will want to get <strong>Destiny HERO - Dangerous </strong>and two <strong>Effect Veiler a</strong>nd only one <strong>The Warrior Returning Alive </strong>that will keep the deck at the same amount of cards and give you another hand trap  This deck can always do something to help even when it doesn't look like the best hand in the world. Defiantly give it a try and if you know a good way to improve on it let me know im always down to make my hero deck better."

Good amou","This is the ice barrier deck i have been playing for a while, Theory crafted over a few months The general strat is to get the stealth kragen out turn one using the revealer, Speaker, silent sea nettle and in a pinch you could use the deep sea city effect on a tuner or prior of the ice barrier. or if you get really lucky you can get out the crystal wing synchro dragon turn one, with usually a surface, hexa spirit and either a silent sea nettle or speaker. using the effect of hexa, making it level 3 then summoning gungnir, mid combo you can use its effect to destroy before getting out the crystal wing synchro dragon. I have found alot of success using the stealth kragen to prevent combos from being played and if that manages to get through you always have the ice barrier trap card as well as the torrential tribute and fury of kairu-shin to help out too. trishula you can get out any time with minimal combo of just using revealer, speaker and the effect of revealer to get speaker out. although it is possible with general wayne too you have a solid removal tool in santa claws as a smaller kaiju, now it does draw on end phase so best to remove. Kaijus i found are too high atk for any of our cards to do much, but it is well enough to be slapped down to prevent the effect! this deck is about recycling the cards used in the graveyard, so don't be scared to discard a few, as most turns you can get everything back out of the grave for what you used to synchro summon!  Side note, you don't always have to synchro summon, you can just keep defender of the ice barrier out as well as another ice barrier card to prevent them from attacking, especially if it is something scary!  Enjoy this deck, the ice barrier aren't as bad as everyone seems to think, with strong control and lock down."

Churn through the deck and make Link-4s without even ever normal summoning.,"""oh it's 50 cards"" shadup... this lets me run more bricks Gates of Dark World over Allure since barricadeborg blocker can tutor it, Dragged Down to The Grave over Dark World Dealings since if you're not stupid you can just set the stuff you don't want them to discard. It's also way more chad and a major flavor win with Called by the Grave  Can probably use more handtraps, this deck is pretty all-in on the combo. Again, 50 cards to maintain density of stuff you want to discard but also not just fold to any sort of interaction. Imperm is the handtrap of choice because you can ""hide"" it from your discard by setting it. You could argue for more, but this deck doesn't really need Halqi lines  Crossout Designator exclusively for Droll and Lockbird, that card shuts this deck down instantly, but I'm sure you can find other cards to use with Crossout. Prohibition is there for a similar reason, but it's just another thing to find with Barricade Blocker if you think the game is going to go that long.  I considered two Apollousa since this deck makes her extremely easily but ultimately decided Abyss Dweller is way better.  Number 46 because I'm poor and don't want to buy something more expensive than that for the Numeron engine, you can probably run something you can actually go into.  I considered number 68 but ultimately decided I wanted powercode talker. He's fantastic with accesscode and isn't terrible on his own either (although he's mostly a link climber and food for accesscode)  As with any deck, season to taste, this probably isn't the best build of this deck, but it's my take on it."
