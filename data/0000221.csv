These synchro monsters can then provide vital disruption and search for other key Swordsoul cards. Due to needing minimal cards to synchro summon, this allows the deck to play many hand-traps to both stop the opponent going second on top of your synchro monsters and allow you to stop them making a huge board turn 1.  The Swordsoul monsters all have the ability to summon a ""Swordsoul Token"" when you eg reveal another Swordsoul in hand, discard another Swordsoul, banish a Swordsoul from your GY etc., and have many cards such as ""Swordsoul of Taia"" and ""Swordsoul Sacred Summit"" to allow the deck to combo consistently post-turn 1 and through hand-traps.  ""Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer"" synergises with cards such as ""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"" to give you a new Swordsoul monster every turn, whilst also being very easy to summon and generating lots of advantage due to cards such as ""Destiny HERO - Celestial"" who is a draw 2 in the GY next turn.  Weaknesses: floodgates such as ""Summon Limit"" and ""There Can Be Only One"", as the deck needs multiple monsters to synchro summon; ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"", however this can be avoided by summoning ""Baronne De Fleur"" with ""Swordsoul Strategist Longyuan"" before summoning 5 times; ""Dimensional Barrier"" as this is a synchro deck.  The deck is relatively easy to play, and I hope you enjoy!"

General strategy is to XYZ Summon Prime Photon Dragon using Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon. Detach in battle phase, and double Prime Photon's already massive ATK points. <h3></h3> <h5>Going First:</h5> If going first, XYZ Summon Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord and Starliege Photon Blast Dragon (Preferably equipped with Photon Orbital, as this will make your board state very hard to deal with)  &nbsp; <h5>General Commentary:</h5> I've been working on this deck list for the better part of 3 years. Play tested against Meta, and seen lots of trial and tribulation. While it's not the best out there, it can certainly hold its own in competitive play. This is the iteration of the deck I'm currently using. Hope you enjoy playing this as much as I have making it!  &nbsp;"

Dragoon here is optional and you can remove it for less bricks and 4 free extra deck slots.  Edge Imp Sabres can return your garnets to your deck. But there are a few less-obvious things I'd also like to mention here: if you activate Tour Guide from the Underworld's effect, then you cannot use your Brave Token engine, but I still feel it is smart to run one copy of Tour Guide so that she can be searched off of Small World when you have a brick hand. Speaking of brick hands, Aquamancer of the Sanctuary is a level three, so you can easily use her as material to make Cherubini if you are desperate."

Combo 2 (Onomatopickup or Onomatopaira + Dodododwarf Gogogoglove/Zubababancho Gagagacoat/Utopic Onomatopoeia) <ol>  	<li>Activate Onomatopickup to search Onomatopaira, or skip step 1</li>  	<li>Activate Onomatopaira to search Dodododwarf Gogogoglove + Zubababancho Gagagacoat, or if 1 of them is already in your hand search instead Utopic Onomatopoeia</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Utopic Onomatopoeia</li>  	<li>Activate it's effect to SP both Dodododwarf Gogogoglove + Zubababancho Gagagacoat from your hand</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon ZS - Utipic Sage without using Zubababancho Gagagacoat</li>  	<li>Activate ZS - Utopic Sage's effect to SP ZS - Ascend Sage from your Deck</li>  	<li>Activate Zubababancho Gagagacoat effect's to SP Utopic Onomatopoeia from your gy</li>  	<li>Activate Dodododwarf Gogogoglove's effect in the gy to SP itself</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Number 39: Utopia using ZS - Ascend Sage + 1 other level 4 (now it's similar to combo 1)</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Number S39: Utopia Prime using Utopia</li>  	<li>Activate Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force to summon Number 99: Utopia Dragner</li>  	<li>Activate Number 99: Utopia Dragner's effect to summon Leo Utopia Ray, and on the summon activate the effect of Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force in your gy to ad it as xyz material to Leo Utopia Ray</li>  	<li>Activate Leo Utopia Ray's effect to equip ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber from your Deck to it</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Gagagaga Magician, or any other NON-Number Xyz using the other 2 level 4s (I prefer to play Gagagaga Magician to be able to play F0 Draco Future in the next turn, reborning ZS - Utopic Sage, if something goes wrong. You can also play instead any other rank 4 monster such as Tornado Dragon or Traptrix Rafflesia.)</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Number F0: Utopic Future using Utopia and Gagagaga Magician</li>  	<li>Xyz Summon Number F0: Utopic Draco Future using it Number F0: Utopic Future as material</li>  	<li>During opponent's Draw Phase activate again the effect of Number 99: Utopia Dragner to summon Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy, and attach Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force to it as material</li> </ol> End board: 3 monster negates + 1 spell negate, also F0 Drago Future cannot be destroyed by battle/effects.  PS: Instead of ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber you can equip ZW - Lightning Blade, 1 less negate for monsters on the field but Leo becames untargettable.  PS2: Only F0 Draco Future's monster negate can negate an effect from everywhere, Leo ans Pegasus negate only monster on the field.  Combo 3 (it's not really a combo) <ol>  	<li>If you have Utopic Astral Hope in your hand you can search for Numbers Protect for an additional negation.</li> </ol> PSS: Some of the card names may change when imported to the TCG.  PSS2: As always be carefull when playing Pot of Desires because some cards are played in 1 copy, if it's possible try to use the other search effects first."

Kairyu-Shin - Leviathan),"  Here's my first ever Mako Tsunami deck. You know, the ""Freaky Fish Guy"" from Duel Monsters? Well, he got some support that focuses on having Umi on your field, the newest card being Kairyu-Shin - Leviathan. Your goal here is to get Umi on your field and ideally end on Leviathan, Umi, and Physalia. If you can't, your ""Plan B"" is sitting on Bahamut Shark and Toadally Awesome.  So you wanna go first every time. The side deck also runs cards like Warrior of Atlantis and Pot of Prosperity to help with consistency if needed. As for why I have Great White in my deck when 7 Colored Fish has higher ATK, it's because Great White was one of Mako's monsters, so it was thematically appropriate."

There are almost no dead hands and the most consistent Artifact deck there is.  Combo's are simple. Diviner sends Hierarchia. Tribute Herald to get Hierarchia and summon orange from deck to get halq-combo started. Actually you don't need Halqcombo. Just make Librarian during the opponents turn and pop your own backrow so you can get barondefleur. There is also the possibility to play Artifact with Unchained and the new Phoenix Enforcer with Artifacts. But this is another deck for another time.

The main plays focus on Level 1 Winged Beasts instead of normal Tri-Brigade combos. This,"The main goal of the deck is doing Lyrilusc things with Tr-Brigade as a support. Your main play is trying to get to double Recital Starlings to get two searches since she is not a Hard Once Per Turn (HOPT), then overlay them into Utopic Future to go into Utopic Draco Future. This play ensures your opponent either Nibirus you during this combo, making your plays safer since Nibiru is HOPT, or you have a monster negate that you save for a Nibiru or during the end phase for your Simorgh's Special Summon to go through. Your main combo line is trying to get a Turquoise Warbler and either a Celestine Wagtail or a Cobalt Sparrow, in order to search for a Lyrilusc Spell/Trap or Level 1 WB respectively. Having these two usually guarantees your UDF combo. With the Wagtail, you want to search Bird-Call, unless you already have it, in which case you search Bird Sanctuary for the extra draw or facilitating an OTK. Normally you want to activate Bird Call when you have a Lyrilusc name that you can spare in hand, since the search is great but the extra body on field is amazing. You would normally search for Nervall first if you summoned a Sparrow, or if you went for a Wagtail, search the sparrow with the first Recital. The Wagtail play is usually the more rewarding because after you added the Sparrow, you activate bird call to search for a Sapphire Swallow, then special summon the Sparrow to get the Nervall search. Now you have a Sapphire Swallow and a Nervall in hand to special summon. The rest of the combos after UDF are really up to you, and they are too spread out and different to go into details here, which is why I highly recommend watching Sir Emanon's combo tutorials for this deck, and while our lists are different, he still has great tips, and you may change this list to your preference too! Remember, decks here are merely suggestions. At the end of the day, you're the pilot of your own deck. Good luck duelist!"

You have basically all cards that negate effects, a s@!t ton of mirror forces, and you also have Gaias and Cyber Dragons to get out some synchros using the ""ghost"" cards.  <span><strong>STEP TWO: </strong></span>Once you have acquired <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, get out Dragoon - I'm pretty sure this is self-explanatory  <span><strong>STEP THREE:</strong></span> Win - I mean, it's dragoon. If your opponent actually finds a way to counter it, and at that three of them, your opponent deserves to win.  Of course, there's another way you can play this deck.  <span><strong>STEP ONE:</strong></span> Set/Summon Monsters and protect them with Mirror Force: This is just another way of holding out, but in a different way than you might think.  <span><strong>STEP TWO:</strong></span> Summon <a data-name=""Predeplant Verte Anaconda"">Predeplant Verte Anaconda</a> - Since this is a fusion-based deck, Verte Anaconda is an obvious staple in the deck. Get this out, then send  Red-Eyes Fusion to the grave to use its effect. (To get out Dragoon of course)  <span><strong>STEP THREE:</strong></span> Win - The same thing as the last strategy, your opponent shouldn't be able to counter Dragoon.

I MIGHT apply some of the methods i found here to the non-budget version. At the very least though, I'm putting Draco Berserker back into the extra deck in the non-budget version. That card is basically a free once per turn Ash Blossom/Ghost Ogre, plus it gains additional attack after using its effect.  &nbsp;  EDIT 2: I've just bit the bullet and decided to make the low-budget version run the Halqi-combo. The magikeys on their own really aren't strong enough, and this build is still only 100 dollars or so for main deck + side deck. That sounds pretty budget enough, and its still rather playable despite the downgrades. To make up for it, i did lean back into the original build from the mkohl40 video and put in 3 copies of pot of desires. It feels much more in line with the deck it's inspired from while still taking a page from the non-budget build."

As such, learning the deck comes with a lot of trial and error, so I would suggest importing any rock deck into a simulator and doing test hands until you can relatively consistently end on good boards. A good end board will end on Crystron Halqifibrax (makes Desert Locusts to force your opponent to pitch 1, then you can make any level 10/12 synchro you like, in this deck: Geomathmech Final Sigma), Adamancipator Risen - Dragite, Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, and Abyss Dweller (or any r4nk of your choice).  There is a general structure to turns despite there being no combos: <ol>  	<li>Summon as many Adamancipator tuners as possible.</li>  	<li>Use their free +1 effects to get rocks on field.</li>  	<li>Make Admancipator Risen - Raptite and activate its effect to summon another rock.</li>  	<li>Use Admancipator Risen - Raptite and a tuner to make either Adamancipator Risen - Dragite or Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon depending on the current game state.</li>  	<li>Make Crystron Halqifibrax and make more synchros.</li> </ol> If you didn't draw into any tuners, making Gallant Granite to search and summon Adamancipator Researcher is the first priority, after which the turn is usually dependant on excavating good cards.  If you have more money to spend unlike me consider replacing some cards with Infinite Impermenance, Baronne De Fleur, etc"

The main problem I had when structuring this deck was the fact that I mainly use Burning Abyss monsters as quick little card destruction effects. For example, you can special summon any Burning Abyss monster from your deck if you control no spell/trap cards. However, if you control a monster that isn't a Burning Abyss monster, the Burning Abyss monster on the field that has just been summoned gets destroyed. However, this is where you can activate their effects. My favorite card to use in a non-Burning Abyss deck is <a data-name=""Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>, because it lets you banish one of your opponent's monsters until the end phase. All the other Burning Abyss cards have similar effects, but there's only a select few that don't use Burning Abyss monsters. Now, when using a deck that is complete Burning Abyss monsters, you will have to wait for your opponent to activate your monster's destruction effect. Is it bad that you will have to sacrifice a couple of monsters to have a chance to get out your extra deck? Yes, but when you do get your boss monsters out, it'll be HELL for your opponent. *<em><span>badum* *crash*</span></em>"
