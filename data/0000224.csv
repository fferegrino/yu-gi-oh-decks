This non-meta deck focuses on the past strategy of Clownblade, where you can spam XYZ Rank 4s. OTK is possible on any t","SHOW THEM THE POWER OF UTOPIA!

This non-meta deck focuses on the past strategy of Clownblade, where you can spam XYZ Rank 4s. However, with the times' progressing signs, there are also options to fusion and link summon while going against Top Tier Meta. Personally, it got me either on or very near the top 100 leaderboards on a popular online simulator website for Yu-Gi-Oh! (For the latest Yu-Gi-Oh! game Master Duel: I went from bronze 5 to platinum 3 with this deck in less than a few days). So I know this deck packs a powerful punch if you know what you are doing on certain moves. I'm a firm believer that rogue non-meta decks can not only compete on their own but also thrive on destroying meta decks to keep your opponent guessing.
<ul>
 	<li>It would help if you preferred to go second because:</li>
</ul>
1.) Most effect monsters in this deck have the effect of ""If your opponent controls a monster and you control no monsters, you can special summon this card.""

2.) You can One-Turn-Kill (OTK) with the ""Number 39: Utopia Double"" strategy. Minimum: You get a boosted 10,000 ATK or higher ""Number 39: Utopia"") by attacking into an opponent's attack mode monster, if and only if the opponent's monster has 2000 attack points or less (10000 ATK utopia minus 2000 ATK monster equals 8000 damage). It means you won when your opponent had 8000 life points or less. Utopia has some support cards in this deck to give other power boosts, protection, and other fun shenanigans. You can power up Utopia and get different variants of him on the field.
<ul>
 	<li>The Clownblade Performage Engine includes cards such as ""Performage Trick Clown,"" ""Performage Damage Juggler,"" and ""Performage Hat Tricker."" The Clownblade engine alone provides Level 4 monsters to spam, block any battle damage from opponent attacks, and block any burn effect damage.</li>
 	<li>There are Utopia support cards.</li>
 	<li>All other cards are tech and staples.</li>
 	<li>Side deck punishes spamming or specific game mechanics.</li>
 	<li>Some cards are in the deck for fun (Such as using the Melodious cards).</li>
</ul>
1. ) For example, you can use the fusion spell card, ""Ostinato,"" to special summon ""Schuberta the Melodious Maestra."" By the effect of ""Ostinato,"" that monster gets destroyed by the End Phase. Then you special summon ""Aria the Melodious Diva"" and ""Elegy the Melodious Diva"" from your Deck.

Above is a formidable defensive board lock where your Melodious monsters<em> cannot be targeted and cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects</em>. There are few options to beat this board lock move. Your opponent can <em>send (without targeting)</em> those cards to the graveyard or banish zone, <em>not targeting</em> with card effects, such as ""Super Polymerization,"" <em>tributing with the Kaiju monsters archetype</em>, or <em>negating all card effects on the field</em>, such as ""Skill Drain.""

""Ostinato"" uses cards from deck or hand. You can send more fodder Melodious cards to the graveyard to make the entire deck more consistent to make other moves without using Melodious cards.
<ul>
 	<li>Another fun thing is to run ""Neos Fusion"" to disrupt the field. Rainbow Neos works very well with the Utopia OTK.</li>
 	<li>Some other cards are situational, such as field spells and other spells/traps. This deck composes of spellcasters, fairies, and warriors.</li>
 	<li>You can XYZ, link, fusion, and synchro summon.</li>
 	<li>You can XYZ summon ""Number 59: Crooked Cook"" (A monster whose monster effect states: While you control no other cards on the field, this card is unaffected by other cards' effects). Combine this XYZ monster with XYZ materials such as ""Astral Kuriboh"" or ""Right-Hand Shark,"" you can make a monster who is unaffected by anything and cannot be destroyed by battle (The only outs for ""Number 59: Crooked Cook"" are Kaiju-like monsters, piercing damage-effect monsters, having your opponent attack your life points directly, or prevent its summon in the first place).</li>
 	<li>You can still run it for Master Rule 4 or Master Rule 5.</li>
 	<li>You can run it for Master Duel.</li>
</ul>
Remember, if you believe in the heart of the cards, and you need a deck that can fit almost all situations, you should try out the deck. It's fun and competitive!"

<span><b><i>Why are we playing these engine's?</i></b></span>

<strong>Rikka:</strong> Your main advantage engine comes from <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal,</a> when activated it searches you any ""Rikka"" monster and during our opponent's End Phase it summons itself back. Our choice of main deck monsters are <a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy</a> which is our XYZ/Synchro enabler, <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a> who searches <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Rikka Sheet</a> to disrupt our opponents or <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility</a> that lets us stall or setup and Extra Deck play, <a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula the Rikka Fairy</a> who is a free body and helps us make our Rank 4 and 6 and lastly <a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica the Rikka Fairy</a> who lets us beat over big boss monsters and can revive itself from grave.

Next is the Extra Deck Rikka's, First is <a data-name=""Rikka Queen Strenna"">Rikka Queen Strenna</a> which is how we recycle our Rikka S/T and when tributed can ""rank-up"" into the other 2 if needed, Then we have <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi the Rikka Queen</a> that protects our monsters by tributing a plant monster in hand or field if they would be destroyed and can also act as Monster Reborn when a card has been tributed, Lastly is <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a> who is our main boss monster and 1 of our main disruption tools, her first effect lets us Tribute our opponents monsters at SS2 and the second effect booster her by 200atk every time a card(s) is tributed.

<strong>Aroma: </strong>Aroma since November 2021 had one of its main build arounds <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram"">Aromaseraphy Sweet Marjoram banned but the deck still has a strong toolbox and drident-like removal with Teardrop the Rikka Queen. To replace her we've opted to play Aroma Gardening, Dried winds and 1 extra copy of Blessed Winds. This should make the Aroma engine still powerful just less consistent than previous builds where the goal was to turbo Sweet as fast as possible.</a>

<strong>Predaplant:</strong> This give us more disruption with predaplanning, strong fusion boss monsters and access to Super Polymerization one of the strongest board breaking cards in the game. This engine really helps solidify our mid game and keep our opponent off of big boss monsters.

<strong>Traps:</strong> Our trap line-up is simple, Disrupt as much as possible. The rest are pure advantage cards that further push our greedy mid-late game.

&nbsp;

<span><em><strong>Openers</strong></em></span>

Our deck isn't that dependent on getting a starter but knowing what your options are is important. Here are the most common openers for the deck.

<strong>Petal into Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and activate its effect to search <a data-name=""Mudan the Rikka Fairy"">Mudan the Rikka Fairy</a>, summon Mudan by tributing Petal and Activate Mudan to search Either <a data-name=""Rikka Sheet"">Rikka Sheet</a> for disruption or <a data-name=""Rikka Tranquility"">Rikka Tranquility</a> for value. This is our standard opener and what we will typically do against most decks.

<strong>Jasmine/Mardel:</strong> Summon <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> in the Centre Column and send <a data-name=""Dandylion"">Dandylion</a> to summon 2 Tokens, Link both Tokens into <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Jasmine"">Aromaseraphy Jasmine</a> and activate its effect tributing <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a> to summon <a data-name=""Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</a> and search either Petal to get the Rikka engine started or <a data-name=""Rose girl"">Rose Girl</a> if your engine is already going.

<strong>Set 4 Pass: </strong>This is probably the 2nd most common opener in this deck but not necessarily a brick, as long as we can continually disrupt the opponent they will eventually have the same ceiling for power that we currently do, which is exactly what we want because we have inevitability in that once we draw our engine cards we can easily start out advantaging our opponent and win from there.

&nbsp;

<span><em><strong>Midgame</strong></em></span>

&nbsp;

Midgame is tricky because its extremely dependent on what your opponent is doing and what you have access to but generally at this point you should be deciding how many turns you can realistically close the game out in and how you are going to accomplish it. Here are some things to look out for in the midgame.

<strong>Abusing Blessed Winds: </strong><a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a> is one of your key cards in the mid game. Making sure you are using each effect to its fullest potential is important.

Keeping your engine's going with the first of effect is crucial to get into a winning position, shuffling back your Rikka cards ensures you have the fuel to keep grinding out your opponent. Dodging removal with the 2nd effect is probably the single most important thing to keep in mind at all times, remember we only have 1 <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Rikka Petal</a> and no way to recover it, if it's banished we are suddenly cut off from one of our main engines. The 3rd effect is a great value tool that lets us keep a strong board presence and re-use strong effects like Aromage Marjoram or Aromaseraphy Jasmine.

<strong>Predaplant's: </strong>Midgame is where predaplants start becoming more relevant, <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning</a> can keep our opponent off of XYZ's and Synchro's while <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra"">Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra</a> can act as unconventional removal. Predaplant Verte Anaconda also spikes in the midgame turning any 2 monsters into Super Polymerization which can be game winning on it's own.

<strong>Establishing Bosses: </strong>In the midgame we really want to summon our boss monsters like <a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen or <span class=""name_txt selectable"">Benghalancer the Resurgent. While summoning Benghalancer can be difficult it can easily be game winning in the right board state so always look for for opportunity's to summon it.</span></a>

<strong>The Advantage Trinity: </strong>This is the point in the game where your secondary advantage engines start kicking in, <a data-name=""Card of Safe Return"">Card of Safe Return</a>, <a data-name=""Dark Factory Of More Production"">Dark Factory Of More Production</a> and <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, These cards give us immense card draw and let us draw into our powerful trap cards in order to keep disrupting our opponent.

<strong>Making the most of our traps: </strong>Traps are our main way of controlling the pace of the game and defending ourselves from big pushes from the opponent, knowing when and how to use your traps is matchup dependent but there are some fundamental's you can apply to any matchup.
<ul>
 	<li>Always keep your opponent's summon limit in mind when choosing when to use your disruption.</li>
 	<li>Is the card worth removing? If the card is easily removed in battle refrain from using your removal too early and save it for a bigger threat.</li>
 	<li>Am I on a clock? A clock refers to the amount of turns your opponent can lethal you from, if you feel like your opponent is trying to race you down then you can be more loose with your removal cards.</li>
 	<li>How much has my opponent committed to a play? The more value you can get from each of your removal cards the better, shotguning your <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a> too early might leave you with less value than if you had waited.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span><em><strong>Late Game</strong></em></span>

<strong>Ending the game: </strong>By this point we should have enough board presence to close the game out with our boss monsters, always keep cards like <a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite! and</a><a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite!""> </a><a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica the Rikka Fairy in mind when trying to close out games.</a>

<strong>Don't get too greedy: </strong>Ensure your plays are all trying to close out the game, don't keep playing for value as you may get punished by a top-deck from your opponent.

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></span>

&nbsp;

Plants are an extremely fun and rewarding deck to learn and has a ton of deckbuilding options beyond just this list. Its grind game potential and flexible toolbox make it great into any meta with the right tech-cards and solid fundamentals."

solitaire: 3 - this is your best normal summon, this can create a 1 card combo that leads to halqifibrax (uni-zombie, send mezuki revive solitaire, summon halqi) allowing you to continue your combo further.

uni-zombie: 3 - another very good normal summon, can discard cards you want in graveyard or can send them from the deck to the graveyard. also is a level variable tuner, allowing access to a lot of your syncro line-up (besides locust since thats something that can be summoned off of halqi if necessary unless you really want to syncro it)

small world: 3 - can be used to search the cards you need to combo, since most of your deck is zombies you can grab basically anything, if you really need a negate in your match up you can even search ash blossom.

zombie world: 3 - it allows us to get away with summoning non zombie monsters, along with triggering balerdochs revive and possibly flood-gating the opponent

mezuki: 3 - a really good combo extender, never a bad choice if you can send something to the graveyard, you can re-use this card with omega and gmg (ghost meets girl) as well

ash blossom: 3 - its ash blossom, what else do i need to say besides the fact its searchable with small world

the gmg main deck engine:

gmg: 3 - if your able to get up to a link three and have one of the 9 (effectivly) copies of this card you can lock your opponent out of special summoning, its second effect can allow you to re-use graveyard effects that require banish's as well. Overall, its really good.

return: 3 - its (effectivly) 3 extra copies of gmg, thats all that matters

traptrick: 3 - its also (effectivly) 3 extra copies of gmg, thats all that matters

main deck 2 of's:

glow-up bloom: 2 - this is a level 1 tuner and a way to spec summon balerdoch or jack-o bolan (mostly balerdoch). you can easily make a link 2 zombie with just this card by summoning linkuriboh off of it.

balerdoch: 2 - its a level 8 body that can summon itself from the graveyard to draw off of sucker, be recurred as material for a i:p play and is a negate.

jack-o bolan: 2 - can special summon itself from the hand and can set up the graveyard with the discard, if needed it can draw you cards off of sucker as well.

Danger package:

danger nessie: 2 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies

danger jackalope: 1 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies

danger tsuchinoko: 1 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies

danger mothman: 1 - the same as all the other dangers, we play this as graveyard setup, draws and field presence that can be turned into zombies

main deck 1 of's:

terraforming: 1 - its another copy of zombie world

foolish: 1 - its graveyard setup

one for one: 1 - graveyard setup and a way to get glow up bloom

banshee: 1 - another, easier way to get zombie world

gozuki: 1 - the worst of the nomal summon package but still good, if needed, you can send it for its second effect allowing you to continue combo's.

extra deck:

yuki onna link 4: 2 - a decent end monster, you can use yuki-onna link 3 to trigger a negate, as well as i:p sending a card with a when sent to the gy effect

yuki onna link 3: 2 -can be summoned off of I:P to get a negate, other than that is mainly just a cheap way to trigger gmg

vamp sucker: 2 - can draw you extra cards during your turn, or let you draw during your opponents.

avendread: 1 - can send cards but is mainly just a battle focused zombie link

halqi: 1 - the key to your combo's, can summon glow up bloom from the deck leading to easy combo's leading to your boss monsters, can also be used to summon locust for a discard and (if you control a level 4) a baronne during your opponents turn.

I:P: 1 - can summon yuki onna link 3 from the extra deck for negate

linkuriboh: 1 - is a way to get glow up bloom from the field to the gy

desert locust: 1 - is there to be a possible summon off of halqi, causes your opponent to discard cards and can summon baronne

red-eyes zombie: 1 - is a battle syncro that can revive, is only really in here to end games if you can do it normally

omega: 1 - can take banished blooms and mezuki's and put them back in the gy, as well as taking a card from our opponent's hand.

barronne: 1 - is here to be summoned from locust, can negate, destroy and revive.

big eye: 1 - idk he's just here for if we have spare jack-o's and nessies, not really important but idk what else to add"

Mill a bunch of cards 2. Banish some Thunder Dragons 3. Win games,"<span><strong>Some Background:</strong></span>

While looking for a new deck to play, I came across the idea of Lightsworn Thunders. However, a search for lists to base inspiration upon was fruitless. So, I pulled a Thanos, and said: ""Fine, I'll do it myself.""

At first, I came up with a Lightsworn heavy 60-card list, but that was bricky and inconsistent. Then, I developed a 60-card Lightsworn light list, which was fine, but not my style. So, I managed to create this 40-card Ligthsworn heavy list.

<span><strong>The Gameplan:</strong></span>

So, the general things that I noticed while playing this deck are:
<ol>
 	<li>This deck can either go first or second, so winning the die roll doesn't matter</li>
 	<li>This deck is speedy</li>
</ol>
<strong>Going First:</strong>
You're going to want to end on Titan and Apollousa. Usually this is accomplished by somehow getting Thunder Dragondark's effect off, adding Thunder Dragon Fusion, summoning Thunder Dragon Titan, and then using the leftovers to summon Apollousa. If you still have stuff leftover, you can make an I:P.

<strong>Going Second:</strong>

Same thing, but use Titan to break boards and kick *ss, then Borrelsword to O<strong>TK.</strong>

<strong>FAQ:

</strong>Q: Why not more Levianeers?
A: For one, it's searchable by Chaos Space; for two, it's a brick if you don't open ways to mill a Roar or a Dark

Q: Where is Hawk &gt;:(((((((((((((((  );&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
A: Hawk is bad &gt;:(

Q: Where is Valk?

A: Valk is bad &gt;:(

Q: Where is Verte?
A: I:P is cheaper

&nbsp;

""War Rock"" focuses on an aggressive playstyle centered around spamming the boards with monsters, battling opponent's monsters, and giving boosts of ATK to its members until the end of the opponent's turn after successfully activating their effects, allowing them to build up surprisingly high ATK in a short space of time. This is facilitated by their Field Spell, ""<a title=""War Rock Mountain"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Mountain"">War Rock Mountain</a>"", which can search a ""War Rock"" monster on activation and Summon a ""War Rock"" monster from the hand at the start of the Battle Phase while also protecting a ""War Rock"" from being destroyed by battle.

Alongside this, most members of the archetype includes an effect in order to Summon themselves or another ""War Rock""/Warrior monster to the field under certain conditions; usually related to battling, destruction, or leaving the field by an opponent's card effect. The Level 4 monsters of the deck, <a title=""War Rock Fortia"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Fortia"">Fortia</a>, <a title=""War Rock Gactos"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Gactos"">Gactos</a>, and <a title=""War Rock Wento"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Wento"">Wento</a>, Special Summon a Level 5 or higher ""War Rock"" monster from hand or Deck when sent to the GY by an opponent's card effect. The Level 5+ monsters include being able to Normal Summon themselves without Tribute, such as <a title=""War Rock Orpis"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Orpis"">Orpis</a> and <a title=""War Rock Mammud"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Mammud"">Mammud</a>, <a title=""War Rock Skyler"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Skyler"">Skyler's</a> effect to Special Summon a Level 5 or lower members of the theme from the GY, and <a title=""War Rock Bashileos"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Bashileos"">Bashileos's</a> effect to Special Summon itself from hand or GY when an EARTH Warrior is destroyed by battle.

The only member without a Special Summon effect is <a title=""War Rock Meteoragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/War_Rock_Meteoragon"">War Rock Meteoragon</a>, which can be seen as the theme's de facto boss monster and what most cards want to Special Summon to the field."

I was already experimenting previously with Synchrons, but its a little too inconsistent now that I can't use tokens. So instead, i've pivoted to using Adamancipators as an engine.

&nbsp;

I'll made an edit later with a proper side deck.

EDIT 1: I realized that there's really no reason not to play Yata in this since Shinobaroness targets it. If you have any dignity, you will play a different side deck, but this is an option i'm presenting, lol."

Once Synchro Summoned, he starts out with a total of 2400 ATK and two Spell Counters which will allow him to destroy two cards on your opponent's side of the field right off the bat. It's an unlimited trigger effect so you activate it any time during your turn to destroy as many cards equal to the amount of Spell Counters you have on him (or on the <strong>Magical Citadel of Endymion</strong> Field Spell).

Here is the main combo which can be done on your very first turn simply by having Assault Sentinel:
<ol>
 	<li>Normal summon <strong>Assault Sentinel</strong> and use its effect to tribute itself to special summon <strong>Psi-Reflector</strong> from your deck.</li>
 	<li>Once Psi-Reflector is special summoned, you can use its effect to grab the<strong> Assault Mode</strong> trap card from your deck to your hand.</li>
 	<li>Activate Psi-Reflector's second effect to reveal Assault Mode in your hand, special summon Assault Sentinel from your graveyard, and raise it's Level by 2 to make it Level 6 (because Arcanite Magician is Level 7).</li>
 	<li>Activate Assault Sentinel's second effect to reveal <strong>Arcanite Magician</strong> from your Extra Deck to turn Assault Sentinel into a Spellcaster type.</li>
 	<li>Now that Assault Sentinel has converted into a Spellcaster-type monster, this will allow you to ultimately Synchro Summon Arcanite Magician from your Extra Deck by tributing Psi-Reflector and Assault Sentinel.</li>
 	<li>With Assault Mode still in your hand, you can simply set it and activate it during your opponent's turn to tribute Arcanite Magician and special summon <strong>Arcanite Magician/Assault Mode</strong>, which you will most likely do if you've already used up the two Spell Counters to destroy things, leaving him vulnerable at 400 ATK. You can also wait until your opponent targets Arcanite Magician with a Spell / Trap or during battle before activating Assault Mode.</li>
</ol>
If you happen to start off with Psi-Reflector in your hand, or is the only card you manage to have on-hand, you can still do the same exact combo except you'd have to discard <strong>Assault Beast</strong> instead. This will allow you to use Psi-Reflector's second effect to special summon Assault Beast from the graveyard in which they can both be used to special summon <strong>Assault Beast Ally of Justice Catastor </strong>from the Extra Deck. You can also use <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> to get Assault Sentinel into the Graveyard if you only have Psi-Reflector in-hand which will still allow you to get Arcanite Magician out.

If you're getting overwhelmed by monsters and / or really need to get rid of a specific monster, you can easily Synchro Summon into <strong>Black Rose Dragon</strong> with Psi-Reflector and any Assault Mode monster (by raising the Levels of Assault Sentinel or Assault Beast by 3 Levels) if necessary.

<strong>Emergency Teleport</strong> just acts as a fourth Psi-Reflector in the deck. I only run one since you only need one Psi-Reflector out to get things going. But you can feel free to run multiples if you'd like.

<strong>One for One </strong>is basically the fifth Psi-Reflector, as it's the only monster this card can be used with. You really want to try to get a Psi-Reflector in your hand as soon as possible.

<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> is only there specifically to special summon <strong>Musician King</strong> from the Extra Deck, in which then he can be used to special summon <strong>Supreme Arcanite Magician</strong> or other Link Monsters depending on the situation.

The Pendulum Monsters; <strong>Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic</strong>, <strong>Magical Abductor</strong>, <strong>Magister of Endyimion,</strong> <strong>Mythical Beast Jackal King,</strong> and <strong>Mythical Beast Master Cerberus</strong>, are just support engines I decided to run with to build up tons of Spell Counters for Arcanite Magician. You can actually overpower your opponent quickly with just the Pendulum Monsters and <strong>Apprentice Magician </strong>alone if you can't manage to draw out Psi-Reflector in time. If you happen to pull out Arcanite Magician late-game, you'd have about twenty Spell Counters to go nuts with by then.

I'm still constantly tweaking the deck and currently changing around the ratios of the Pendulum Monsters and Pendulum Monster selection but so far this is what's playing more smoothly than all my previous builds when I'd first started it.

Feel free to throw out any recommendations as I've just gotten back into this game recently. I'm not really trying to go for a meta / tournament build as I just wanted to play something fun, but I'm still open to those suggestions anyway."

&nbsp;

3x Swordsoul of Mo Ye: Main 1 Card Combo - for Level 8 Synchros +draw 1

3x Swordsoul Strategist Longyuan: Main 1 Card Combo - for getting to Level 10 Synchros +1,200LP Burn

3x Swordsoul of Taia: Main 1 Card Combo - for Level 8 Synchros +Foolish Burial

3x Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous: Potential Free Summon going 2nd to get to Mo Ye, or Taia

3x Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna: Another Free Summon, AND a Searcher for Tenyis

2x Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda: Compulsory Evacuation

2x Tenyi Spirit - Adhara: Free Summon, Recursion for longer duels. A Level 1 Tuner for Odd Level Synchros

3x Dimension Shifter: Chengyin Buffer, almost impossible to play around Handtrap (use during OPP's Draw Phase to dodge Gamma and Triple Tac)

&nbsp;

Spells/Traps (17 Spells, 2 Traps):

&nbsp;

3x Swordsoul Emergence: NAH, THIS IS THE HOLY SWORD ""EXCALIBUR.""

1-2x Swordsoul Sacred Summit: You only need one since it's mostly an OTK/Floodgate Deck, You may want to look into 2 or more for doubles tho.

3x Vessel for the Dragon Cycle: Triple ROTA/FOOLISH BURIAL. Say ""No Mas."" You get the ROTA effect when you link into Tenyi Shaman.

3x Pot of Desires: I think Prosperity is Preferred.. But this deck already $$$, this is good too tho because you get tons of recursion and buffs.

1x Called By the Grave: Hand-Traps? Watertho0o0ose.

3x Dark Ruler No More: OCG MUST, for us tho, idunno bro.

2-3x Triple Tac: Probably best card in our Group RN. You can swap them out for other stuff tho.

2x: Swordsoul Blackout: Double Pop, Also level 4 Tuner Token. If you pop Chengyin, you can use his effect to protect and still double pop.

0x Swordsoul Assessment: I don't really think you need this, it's an honest. I'd Probably only use it if you have a hard time outing Dragoon.

&nbsp;

Extra Deck:

&nbsp;

2x Swordsoul Grandmaster - Chixiao: Good for Banish Fueling, Imperm/Veiler Disruption Effect

1x Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying: Boss Monster, 100 atk/def per banished, Banish effect, Hard to remove

2x Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing: Non-Destruction Removal, GY Recursion

1x Baronne de Fleur: Yeah. This Card's Busted. 'Nuff Said.

1x Cyber Slash Harpie Lady: OCG likes to run it for spells that have prerequisite Monsters (Flex Pick)

1x Chaofeng, Phantom of the Yang Zing: Light/Dark Protection from Hand-Traps

1x Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen: Macro Cosmos (Monster Vers.)

1x Crimson Blader: Really good against our Meta, Prevents Lvl 5+ from being summoned. UCT? Virtual World? Dragoon? Eldich? Cyber Who?

1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi: Non-Targeting Banish (DRAGOON?), Also Fat Beat-stick, probably stronger than Sovereign Chengyin.

1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing: Extender. Disruption, I think every card in this deck is somehow a disruption tho.

1x Adamancipator Risen - Dragite: This card is so good, 5 Card deck peek, and Omni-Negate if you summoned using Mo Ye.

1-2x Monk of the Tenyi: Extender for any Tenyi monster, Because their effects can be used in HAND OR GRAVE (""O3O"").

&nbsp;

Side Deck:

&nbsp;

1x Archnemeses Protos: 20$ Target Attribute Dark Hole + Floodgate. It's good, but can you afford it? $_$

3x Nibiru, the Primal Being: Always Good.

1x Dinowrestler Pankratops: Highly Rec in this deck, Even used in the OCG here.

3x Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay: Vs Link Decks, Sky Striker, Phantom Knights, Six Sam (1st Ogre/Nib, 2nd Droll Better tho), Arcana Knight, Sometimes CD.

3x Artifact Lancea: Good against Most decks, PK, Dinos, Eldlich.

1x Droll &amp; Lock Bird: Guess not too popular in OCG

2x Twin Twisters/Cosmic Cyclone: Very Popular in OCG

1x Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju: For the Unexpected.

&nbsp;

Alternative Extra Deck cards:

&nbsp;

1x Swordsoul Catastrophe - Qixing Longyuan: Not out yet BUT BROKEN, HAS ALL OF THE ABOVE SS EFFECTS!!

1x Beelzeus of the Diabolic Dragons: Uhmmm, you actually can't summon it with any of the cards I mentioned.. But it's cool.

1x Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons: Lil' Bro of Beelzeus, But I still don't know how you get them out, OCG uses them often, I think you use Synchron Resonator?

1-2x Colossal Fighter: Versus Warrior Decks, This guy is a Beast. (Phantom Knights, Infernobles, HEROES, Six Samurai ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Poggers.)

1x Black Rose Dragon: OCG Favorite, But not as in Duos. Flex it if you want :^)

1x Geomathmech Final Sigma: This Card is unbeatable!! (Except by Cyber Dragon Chimeratechs)

This deck's advantage is playing through handtraps(except D-shifter). This deck is also very good at going second with board breakers like breaksword, unicorn, and arc-rebellion. This decklist brought me first at a 45 man back to duel tourney which consisted of tri-brigade, drytron, ect. I feel as if this deck will be meta going into this format and is a deck with a kick. This list could be altered to fit more extenders or more handtraps depending on how you would like to play."

Marincess has strong potential finally. Lets talk about the cards here.

Marincess Wave is not once per turn...and can be activated from hand multiple times!!! Goal number one is to have 2 waves in hand.

Tuner game is still pretty good. I can arboria as an extender into halqifibrax. Then halqifibrax can actually go into locust to handloop 1 and then go into baronne. Nice option and variety for casual but can be displaced by handtraps as needed.

Frog engine just works in any water most of the time...

New link 4 is a backrow negate. How many backrow you plan to negate? 1 right? then its all you need plus the waves is awesome.

Our goal is to summon Nekomusume as soon as possible (by Ghostrick Festival or dig the deck with Siren or Allure and then special summon her by Ghostrick Shot or Ghostrick Fairy) and then search for Ghostrick Night (either by Ghostrick Stein or Ghostrick Siren or Ghostrick Angel of Mischief). After that, you can search for Vanish or Scare for your second and third trap. At this point, you probably have 80% win chance.
Zeus is for plan B when you have too many Lv1 monsters or you just want to wipe the field.
Goodluck and have fun!"

This is a prerelease deck so it is subject to change, but with the field spell, fusion spell and main monster Albaz, it can allow you to put out fusion monsters rather quickly and pull cards from the deck in order to get a fusion so long as the deck is prepaired to do so. this is a basic template, so cards can be changed out to meet user needs."

Small World came out and is a thing, right?

&nbsp;

One of the biggest issues I've had with the deck over the past few months are those hands where you open unplayable. I've tried just about everything to help minimize those hands, but nothing really helped without losing just about every hand trap spot. Even then, I still bricked more often than I would like.

&nbsp;

But small world is a thing now! This means that any machine or veiler in hand can turn into a dozer, metalcruncher, fortress, or bullet train (or anything other than harvester), and as and bell can turn into bullet train or harvester. All while naturally adding to the hand trap/interruption line up for the deck.

&nbsp;

Try it out..... you may be pleasently surprised!"

Either Mayakashi, Shiranui, or Zombie World.","Depending on your opening hand, you have three different ways that this deck can play out. This makes the deck varied in its plays and versatile in its response to threats. But in return for this, the deck is less consistent in getting any of its three strategies started. The ideal hand is one in which you can do your whole Mayakashi Synchro climb and send Necroworld Banshee to the grave with Yuki-Musume to activate Zombie World. This sets up your graveyard for future plays and forces your opponent to work around Zombie World. In the case that you do not open with a way to do your Synchro climb, the other starting cards you are looking for are Shiranui Squire, Shiranui Solitaire, Uni-Zombie, or Jack-o-Bolan. Shiranui Squire is an immediate Synchro Summon into Squiresaga which allows you to then banish Squire to fix your hand and fill your graveyard. Shiranui Solitaire allows you to go into a large number of cards depending on what else you have in hand. You can get out Dakki if you have Yuki-Musume in hand and continue with Mayakashi plays, or you can get out Uni-Zombie and set up for future turns. Uni-Zombie allows you to fill your graveyard with cards that can help accelerate your future plays and turns. And then Jack-o-Bolan is a fun card that can get a key card into your graveyard and allows you to interact with your opponent on their turn. The Zombie World and Rivalry of Warlords is always a fun lock to put up and is the only reason this deck can go up against meta decks. Swallow Slash is a better Icarus attack that can get rid of three things if you banish Shiranui Spiritmaster with its effect. And as a finisher, you have Sunsaga which resets the board and refills your Extra Deck. The easiest way to get out Sunsaga is with Balerdroch and Spectralsword, and can be done with both cards on the field, or with both cards in the graveyard. Overall, this is a very fun Zombie Deck that allows you to grind pretty hard once you get all the pieces in place, but loses if your starter gets negated or if your Graveyard gets banished to death."

Brigade engine obviously helps you dodge handtraps (you still die to droll)

Small World is for testing but i think it works really well with the deck

Gamaciel is important for small world target and recyclable via sun mou removal

TLDR: Ancient Warrior is slept on and imo you can sometimes with the right build beat meta stuff since people dont know the matchup......yet

Easy to pick up, intermediate difficulty to master, you can pick the deck and once you get going build it however you want

Edit: forgot to add pot of prosperity, but yes you can replace extrav with it, i think prosperity is better but extrav aint half bad either"

Marincess is a midrange deck that can accrue tons of advantage off of one card, which even in worst case scenarios like drawing Pascalus and nothing else will still net you an interruption in Wave and a ridiculous amount of followup after getting its board broken.

&nbsp;

A big issue the deck has is that, just like its fellow animal-based Cyberse-type control deck with huge amounts of recursion coming from the main cast in the VRAINS anime, Salamangreat, it dies really hard to Nibiru.

To alleviate this weakness, where others see fit to play Crossout, which does go well into the deck, since it can fit a whole bunch of handtraps, I preferred to go with the option that probably won't cost me well over a hundred dollars and use a lot of WATER level 4 extenders to go into Bahamut Shark (who doesn't just represent an omninegate, but is also a free water body) by the 4th summon, with the added bonus of being decent at playing through interruptions other than handtraps when going second and helping you end on some of the strongest disruptive rank 4s in the game, like Kragen, Abyss Dweller or Toadally Awesome.

Access to Stealth Kragen, particularly, can put this deck over the top, since it's sort of a boneless Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, having a quick, non-targetting pop every turn and being able to float into itself while getting your resources back through Kragen Spawn, which you can attach Toad to from the GY.

Foolish Burial Goods lets you send Ice Barrier to grab either one of your best extenders, Abyss Shark, or Gameciel to break boards (you can bounce Gameciel with Argonaut btw, it's really funny when it happens). Additionally, you can sometimes also send Fury of Kairyu-Shin to dodge stuff like DPE, or a Marincess backrow to add back with Rock/Anemone, which usually only comes up after you eat an Ash on Sea Angel.

&nbsp;

Some rationalizations for changes I've made over other marincess builds and the previous versions of this deck:

Mandarin isn't here because I've tried to lab plenty of combos using her, but I've only found that she helps you with making Argonaut unaffected through the field in some pretty specific hands and she isn't a very good card to draw. The setup she requires means she's pretty bad for extending after your combo gets interrupted too.

Sleepy Maiden being level 5 and therefore not normal summonable or able to go into the link-1s or the Xyzs makes her kind of bad and testing the deck in real games has led me to believe the combos where you send her with Tang and use her effect to equip Anemone to Argonaut without needing the field aren't optimal most of the time, so I dropped her.

I run 3 Pascalus because she helps a lot with making rank 4s while doing the Marincess stuff and a lot of people just shotgun imperm/veiler on her, which rarely does much of anything. She also gets you back Wave, Dive or Ocean, if it got destroyed, back to your hand turn 3 to go for the kill which is pretty good.

I don't run Accesscode because almost every one of your really good cards locks you into water monsters and Argonaut ends up accomplishing pretty much the exact same thing while being easier to make, but I don't think it's necessarily wrong to run it if you can find space in your extra for it and Transcode."

When playing a Neos deck, be prepared to activate <a data-name=""Neos Fusion"">Neos Fusion</a>, having 7 options to choose from, then defaulting to 2 of them.

<a data-name=""Rainbow Neos"">Rainbow Neos</a> is an incredibly versatile card to help even the playing field with your opponent. You'll want to go into him if your opponent has a field of monsters that you're not gonna be able to deal with, or a lot of backrow. If neither are the case, shuffling back their GY is costless and never hurts.

<a data-name=""Neos Kluger"">Neos Kluger</a> can swing for massive amounts of damage and deal a lot of burn. If you equip Kluger with <a data-name=""Favorite HERO"">Favorite HERO</a>, you'll have a 6000 ATK beat-stick that burns your opponent for large amounts of damage. Since his burn effect is not OPT, you can use the second attack with Favorite HERO to hit in a second time to close the game. Favorite HERO is also the reason why we run a single copy of Neo Space.

Sadly the other Neos Fusions aren't in the same league.  Starting with the two-piece fusions, <a data-name=""Air Neos"">Air Neos</a> used to be the biggest beat-stick, but is more often than not outclassed by Kluger. <a data-name=""Dark Neos"">Dark Neos</a> can negate monster effects, but hits the field after most of the ones you'd want to negate are taken care of. <a data-name=""Grand Neos"">Grand Neos</a> spins a monster back, but so does Rainbow Neos. <a data-name=""Aqua Neo"">Aqua Neo</a>s is probably the best of these with his hand ripping effect, but is held back by it being random. <a data-name=""Brave Neos"">Brave Neos</a> searches for either Miracle Contact or Neos Fusion when he destroys a monster, which is a decent effect but is too slow.

The triple/quad contact fusions are pretty great, but are a pain to summon. <a data-name=""Cosmo Neo"">Cosmo Neo</a>s drains all your resources, but if you have lethal it ensures that nothing will stop you. <a data-name=""Nebula Neos"">Nebula Neos</a> gives you some much needed draw power and negation. <a data-name=""Storm Neos"">Storm Neos</a> clears the backrow... (so does Rainbow Neos lol). All of these cards clear the field when they go home to visit grandma during the end phase.  This is usually not helpful during your end phase, and while it can be good during your opponents end phase with Neos Fusion's GY effect, you have to think about what you are possibly gonna do during your next turn after losing everything. Just pray you don't draw into any of the Neo Spacian's you shuffled back.

<a data-name=""Fusion Dispatch"">Fusion Dispatch</a> summons any of your Neo Spacians/Neos/Yubel from the Deck and helps a lot for contact fusing the larger monsters. <a data-name=""NEXT"">NEXT</a> is potentially a great card, but Neo Spacians and Neos rarely hang out in the GY. <a data-name=""Miracle Contact"">Miracle Contact</a> keeps this deck somewhat playable. I wish <a data-name=""Convert Contact"">Convert Contact</a> didn't have the ""control no monsters"" restriction, but is otherwise your only draw power. <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>/<a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a>/<a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a> are good for going 2nd (BTW good luck if you have to go first, you're gonna need it).

Don't think too hard about the Link monsters. <a data-name=""Verte Anaconda"">Verte Anaconda</a> is basically the only one that matters. I honestly couldn't think of what else to put.

Feel free to add in <a data-name=""Neos Wiseman"">Neos Wiseman</a> if you really want to float into him with Kluger, personally I didn't bother considering the massive amount of bricks Neos has to put up with already. While you're at it, go ahead and swap out the spare Grand Mole's, Dark Panther's, and link monsters for a copy of Flare Scarab, Glow Moss, and their fusions you absolute madman.

Let me know what you think! This is by no means a definitive deck list."

The Windwitch engine gives the deck consistent access to a strong boss monster. Torrential + Solemn Strike is a great combination in the backrow. Droll + Reincarnation is annoying because people aren't going to play around it in the modern day.

The reason I'm playing the Windwitch engine and Ties is because you need to find at least one to get things going. Decks can have trouble dealing with an indestructible Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.

You end up generating an absurd amount of advantage if the games go long."

Been playing this deck since Summer of 2011. It's gone through a lot of changes over the years for me. This deck has become a fun combo deck that reminds me of Orcust. The Phantom Knight engine is a recent inclusion. This deck has a very easy line to the combo that ends with a Dark Requiem and a Fog Blade at MINIMUM. The deck can output a BSD provided you open well enough. If you don't like the Phantom Knight engine you can opt for a Simorgh, Apex Avian, Cyber Dragon Infinity Package.
