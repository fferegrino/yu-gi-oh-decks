Now time to save Ranked!","<p>Branded is a deck near and dear to my heart, something I've played for... almost as long as I played Master Duel. It's one of my main decks, one I go back very frequently. I've played it with Despia, with Dragonmaids, with Tearlaments, with the modern Bystial support, and now...</p><p>Here we are. In a format dominated by Snake-Eyes, this stands... as the strongest competitor I've managed to find. The arguable second best deck in the format (basically fighting with Labrynth for that spot), and one that I found a surprisingly high win-rate with against those ever-so-frustrating Level 1 Fires. I feel like most of us understand what Branded's cards do, so I'll keep the explanations brief on that front, but here's a breakdown of my choices.</p><h2>Engine</h2><ul><li>We run an effective 9 copies of Branded Fusion, across Aluber, Branded Opening, Springans Kitt, the Foolish Burial and Gold Sarcophagus to send Despian Tragedy, and some two-three card combos that net you the same (Despian Tragedy+Patchwork, Tragedy/Mercourier+Allure, or Tragedy+Polymerization+a DARK monster). You can run Keeper of Dragon Magic, either in place of Kitt or alongside her, if you're desperate for more copies or really want that discard instead of Kitt's cost, but I felt that's a bit excessive.</li><li>On the subject of Kitt vs. Keeper, I favor Kitt because she can A: SS herself if you already have an Albaz fusion on field/GY, and B: can also pick up other Branded cards (whereas the best you're getting with Keeper is Fusion Deployment or Polymerization, if you already have Branded Fusion). I find the math adds up better in Kitt's favor, even with her cost for searching being worse. I also just like Kitt, she's really cute.</li><li>I previously ran Nadir Servant and Dogmatika Maximus, but with the coming banlist (as of this writing) semi-limiting Nadir... I felt it was better to cut that engine. If you want to run it, the ratios I played were 3 Nadir (now 2), 1 Maximus, and 1 N'tss in the Extra Deck. It's a really good engine when you draw Nadir, giving you a draw by sending Garura and the ability to get two Albaz fusions into the GY (typically Titaniklad and Albion).</li><li>Bystial Lubellion is run at 2 because I only have two copies. Count is flexible, depending on how desperate you are for access to the Bystial control engine. Access is still fairly easy even at one copy, because we can use Branded Fusion to send Bystial Lubellion for Albion (more on that in a bit).</li><li>Quem is run at 1 because I only have one copy, and I generally would prefer to open Aluber/Kitt instead of her where possible. You only have 1 normal, and the choice between Aluber or Quem always adds up to Aluber being the better choice if you don't literally know your opponent has an Ash Blossom you can't stop. (though there's a decent chance they'll Ash your Quem, MD players will sometimes just click buttons even in Master Rank)</li><li>The Bystial control engine mentioned prior consists of 1 Branded Beast, 1 Branded Regained, and then some Bystials (2 Lubellion and 1 each of the Level Sixes). This is primarily meant as an engine to counter stun and some backrow decks, a match-up we otherwise have an extremely poor time with. Branded's monster interaction is on point, but our Spell/Trap hate is otherwise limited to Guardian Chimera and our out-of-engine Feather Duster. And I guess Brightest, Blazing, Branded King, but I don't run that card. Beast and Regained with even just 1 Level 6 Bystial in rotation is a potent resource loop that basically wins a lot of grind games if it comes down to it. Unprotected backrow gets nuked by Beast, Regained revives Bystials for an endless conga line of big bunguses and also provides draw power and recovery for banished monsters. That said, sometimes stun games are effectively unwinnable, so be willing to just surrender and move on.</li><li>Frightfur Patchwork is an old tech from the post-Albaz Strike days of Branded, and it's still extremely useful. The Edge Imp Chains are easy discard fodder that convert into a +1 and DARKs for some of our fusions, the Polymerizations provide you with extra access to fusion (and allow Guardian Chimera to be untargetable), and Patchwork searches both.</li><li>Fusion Deployment is a post-Cartesia tech, and one I'm fond of. Fusion Deployment insulates any other plays you might have (allowing Aluber/Kitt/Albion/Lubellion to dodge Imperm/Veiler by fusing them with Cartesia), allows you to break/pressure boards by summoning Albaz, and provides extension via Cartesia's effect.</li><li>Allure of Darkness I chose because we have a lot of DARKs, including a couple who benefit from being banished, and every drop of consistency is practically gold. Sometimes you'll be forced to banish a DARK you didn't want to lose, but you also were probably in a bad position if you were that desperate.</li><li>Most of our Extra Deck is pretty standard for modern builds. 1 Lubellion+2 Albion+2 Mirrorjade+1 Titaniklad+1 Rindbrumm+1 Granguignol+1 Guardian Chimera is more or less default for current decklists, and the questions mostly just come from the rest of our ED. I chose Masquerade as our Despia fusion (I just prefer it over Quaeritis), I chose Alba-Lenatus to hate-crime Dragon decks (and as extra fodder for Mirrorjade), I chose Luluwalilith as a Granguignol target, and Garura+Mudragon are Super Polymerization/Branded Banishment targets (and Mudragon can be the target for a Tragedy+DARK fusion, if you end up in that kind of situation).</li><li>Non-engine is flexible, pretty much everything that isn't a Branded card or mentioned already can be swapped out at your preference. I've deliberately cast my net wide, trying to cover most of the meta with my choices of handtraps and the like, but you may want to consider making a more targeted meta calls. Use your head here, I'm not your mom.</li><li>We also just recently got a new bit of support in the OCG, in the form of Dogmatikalamity Alba System. It is not worth running. It's cool, but it's not very good. I will not be running it unless they give us some absolutely bonkers support to make turboing it out optimal.</li></ul><h2>On the Subject of a Certain Gimmick</h2><p>The Gimmick Puppet, or Ido the Supreme Magical Force, or any other number of monsters you can use for this, lock is an infamous one ever since Branded Expulsion's release. It's the other win condition of Branded, able to completely lock your opponent out of playing the game. Very few decks are able to outright play through it, or necessitate cards like Forbidden Droplet to be able to remove Ido so they can play.</p><p>It also sucks. This sounds absurd to say, considering how despised it is, but I genuinely believe that the strategy of locking your opponent out of summoning by using Albion the Sanctifire Dragon's effect... is bad. I wasn't really able to articulate why for the longest time, but Daimax's ""Stop Building Worse Centur-Ion"" article managed to help me figure it out.</p><p>You have to effectively center yourself around the concept of the Gimmick Puppet Nightmare lock (the most famous, and arguably best, variant of the lock), from the moment you start your plays. If you see the line, you basically have to go for it, since Master Duel is a Best of 1 format (so you can't determine if your opponent can play around it or stop it dead then decide). In doing so, you're typically forced to pass up much better boards.</p><p>All for a strategy that dies if your opponent drops even the slightest hint of GY hate. In Master Duel, where everyone and their mother is running Called by the Grave at minimum. In Master Duel, where giving your stun-maining opponent a big body is basically just buying them another turn. In Master Duel, where people run a lot of control decks that legitimately do not care if they've been locked down for the turn.</p><p>Basically, you are trading Branded's greatest strengths (its absurd grind game, its ability to play through blow-out handtraps like Droll or Shifter and still end on functional boards, and the potency going first or second) to instead inflict a middling turn skip upon your opponent that may not even win you the game. I specifically caution against playing this in a Bo1 format, and don't even necessarily believe it's a particularly good in Bo3.</p><p>It's the same reason why Daimax believe that a pure Raidraptor build that puts down multiple Towers-type monsters on the board was better than the Kali Yuga turn skip. Everyone is effectively prepared for a Puppet lock (because everyone runs Called By, and probably some other form of GY hate) and you had to go first to get it anyway (in which case you were in a winning position regardless of whether it's by summoning Mirrorjade or performing the Puppet lock). A lot fewer people are prepared to deal with an extended grind game with Branded, and only two decks can actually match it in a grind at all (Lab and Snake-Eyes, and even then it often ends up in our favor). A deck that wins even just 51% of its games going first and going second is going to be better than a deck that wins 90% of its games going first and 10% of its games going second, and a lot less miserable to play on ladder.</p><h2>Combo and Other Play Advice</h2><p>There's a lot of possible combo lines to do, and Branded is fairly skill-intensive and requires a lot of thought between managing resources and deciding what you're putting on the board. Here's the best combo I've found off 1.5 cards.</p><ol><li>(open either Branded Fusion+1 DARK or one of its searchers and literally any other card to discard)</li><li>Search Branded Fusion with Aluber/Kitt if you have not opened it. If you have opened Branded Fusion+Aluber/Kitt, I typically search Branded Lost to insulate plays but it's up to preference.</li><li>Activate Branded Fusion, sending Albaz and Bystial Lubellion to summon Albion the Branded Dragon.</li><li>Use Albion effect to fuse Albaz+1 DARK that isn't Albion the Branded Dragon (Aluber or Kitt if you summoned them, another DARK in hand if you have to) to summon Lubellion the Searing Dragon.</li><li>Fuse Lubellion the Searing Dragon and Albaz to make Mirrorjade by using its effect.</li><li>Use Bystial Lubellion's SS effect to tribute Albion the Searing Dragon.</li><li>Bystial Lubellion effect, place down a Continuous Spell/Trap (Regained, probably).</li><li>In the end phase, use Albion's effect to set a Branded Spell/Trap. If this was your only play (IE, you didn't open any extenders), Beast is probably the best in a vacuum (immediately usable by tributing Lubellion and able to do something against most decks in the format), but Banishment and Retribution are both viable choices. Red is also good... if you actually have an Albaz/Despia in GY, so depends on how you navigated your plays beforehand.</li></ol><p>Match-up advice:</p><ul><li>VS Snake-Eyes: Actually a good match-up for us... for a slightly silly reason. In my own personal experience, Snake-Eyes takes too long to kill us and will often outright lose to time limit before they get the chance to actually win. Aside from MD's timer problem, we have a decent match-up with Snake-Eyes, in spite of Mirrorjade being easily outed by Subversion/Flamberge. Our grind game is obscene, and even Snake-Eyes can find it difficult to bust through our boards without non-engine help. Honestly, the biggest problem they can present us with is Apollousa as we often can't burn through that many monster negates (especially if they don't mindlessly negate the first 3/4 monster effects you activate and actually save their negates for key cards). It's a surprisingly even match-up, all things considered, and I've found pretty good success this season already (currently Master 4) against Snake-Eyes. The Kashtira variant with Unicorn is a lot more problematic, since they can easily screw us out of important ED cards, but it's still perfectly winnable.</li><li>VS Labrynth: Definitely a lot more annoying, honestly our worst match-up in this current meta. Dimensional Barrier and the Virus cards can kick us out of the game entirely, and even Lovely's handrips can prove very annoying. Branded generally matches poorly against backrow-oriented strategies (removal requires some level of setup, and we can't negate Spell/Traps without Brightest, Blazing, Branded King, which is also not a great solve since it'll only negate face-up Spell/Traps at the time of activation), and Labrynth is no exception. We can still get wins, but you'll likely have to rely on getting through your first turn or opening non-engine like Ash Blossom.</li><li>VS Unchained: I have not encounted enough Unchained to actually come to any conclusions about our match-up. We are neither super concerned about being destroyed (Opening can protect our fusions, most of our monsters will have their effects still resolve if they're destroyed, only Albaz's effect to fuse is particularly worried) or destroying things (we have plenty of monster removal that doesn't destroy, just be careful about Mirrorjade's effect when removed). Wave High King Caesar's effect to negate summons is honestly our only major concern, and even that is rendered moot if Branded Lost is on the field. I'd put it at being in our favor, but I really couldn't tell you.</li><li>VS Kashtira: By far our most annoying match-up, though Kash is not highly represented as a pure strategy these days. Long story short, Arise-Heart turns off a lot of our stuff thanks to its Macro Cosmos effect, including Mirrorjade's banish and typically ends up with 3 materials by the time you can try to fuse it away with Albaz. Combine that with Unicorn and Fenrir being general pains in the butt, and you have a match-up I generally do not look forward to.</li><li>VS Stun: Our outright worst match-up, highly dependent on what you managed to open. Aluber and Albaz can easily beat over most of the common floodgate monsters (the Barrier Statues, Pachycephalo, Jowgen), and most of our other monsters can do the same. However, they typically supplement those monsters with Moon Mirror Shield and the Solemn cards. If you get into a winning position, you'll probably maintain that position until victory, but it'll be a difficult climb to victory. A lot of the time, it's probably best to just surrender if you don't think you can win. Save your time and energy for games you can actually beat.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Like they almost always play second fiddle to the usual Xyz-related interaction suspects?</p><p>Not to put myself or my creations on a pedestal, nor take others or theirs down a peg. But so much more is possible with Time Thief beyond end boards that read more like a TCGplayer buylist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Case in point, Time Thief Power Reserve. I'm as guilty of scratching my head looking upon it at first as the rest the world. ""This is their attempt at a Brigandine? So much for getting my hopes up...""</p><p>That was until Age of Overlord graced us with the Armored Xyz package, specifically Full-Armored Xyz. Pair it up with Power Reserve and we've got one of the two aces for the archetype with their strongest disruption effects immediately online, plus more non-targeting removal for later!</p><p>...But I'm getting ahead of myself. All this and more's in store (or out, if the Thieves beat you to it) when all the deck's Xyz components work hand-in-hand for some out-of-the-box shenanigans leaving your opponent perplexed and their resources in other hands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1hr23u84j9n"" style=""text-align: center;"">The Plan</h2><p>Setting up is relatively easy, provided you have both a pair of Level 4 monsters to open into and a route to Bezel Ship in GY. Though Shade Brigandine and Sakitama aid in this a fair deal, by far the deck's best friend (pun semi-intended) in this regard is Time Thief Regulator. Summon it as your sole monster, and you can Tribute it to tag into two of its fellow Thieves from deck. The two most important include Winder and Adjuster, which search and bin their on-theme cards respectively. However, their in-hand effects allow them to Summon themselves, so you can instead reserve Regulator's tutors for either of the Main Deck's on-theme Machine monsters (just pretend Temporwhal doesn't exist like the rest of the hot-blooded populus).</p><p>To illustrate the different Regulator combinations I've noticed, here is a list of them that still allows you access to all the Level 4 bodies you need:</p><ul><li>Regulator -&gt; Winder &amp; Adjuster, Winder effect to search Power Reserve/Retrograde &amp; Adjuster effect to bin Bezel Ship</li><li>Regulator -&gt; Winder &amp; Bezel Ship, Winder effect to search Power Reserve/Retrograde &amp; freebie Adjuster from hand</li><li>Regulator -&gt; Adjuster &amp; Bezel Ship, Adjuster effect to bin Chronocorder, overlay both monsters for Redoer, Winder effect to detach one from Redoer and freebie, then Regulator effect to banish self and trigger Chronocorder's revival effect</li></ul><p>From any of the three above, you've secured your Extra Deck setup route and then some. Overlay the two bodies you're left with into Raidraptor - Force Strix and use its effect to detach one and search Raidraptor - Singing Lanius. After that birdie perches on your field, detach Force Strix's remaining material with Bezel Ship's effect in GY to revive it, then Link both your Winged Beasts into Raidraptor - Wise Strix. This blue bird's song will call Raider's Wing from deck to the field, allowing it to be overlayed with Bezel Ship for a second Force Strix, detaching Raider's Wing to play a role similar to the first but searching Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius this time around. Wise Strix will reward your composition with a Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force from deck immediately after, one you'll use to call the first Force Strix from its GY slumber and promote it to Cyber Dragon Infinity. Good old CDI will offer Wise Strix a ride and attach it as material, freeing up the Extra Monster Zone for another key player to take the field.</p><p>To prepare for their arrival, have Raider's Wing detach the second Wise Strix's remaining material to revive itself, then allow Wise Strix to be overlayed and usher in Xyz Armor Fortress, the key to making the most out of Power Reserve. Detaching its one material grants you a Full-Armored Xyz from deck, as well as allowing it to be promoted and overlayed into Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer. With the two Xyz Monsters bearing fellow Xyz Monsters as material, Strangle Lanius can now emerge from your hand with Raider's Wing's guidance. Seeing as CDI bears the DARK Force Strix under it, it will target and revive Singing Lanius in GY to be overlayed alongside it into our first glance at the deck's eponymous Xyz Monsters: Time Thief Perpetua. She has major plans for the opponent's turn, but for now she'll attach a second Power Reserve from deck to CDI to enable an extra spot of removal later. Once Power Reserve and Full-Armored Xyz are set, the turn can be passed and the heist can truly begin.</p><p>During the Standby Phase of your opponent's turn, activate Power Reserve to bring itself to the Monster Zone as a Level 4 monster, and immediately after activate Full-Armored Xyz to overlay it and Raider's Wing into the one and only Time Thief Redoer. After Redoer snags the top card of your opponent's deck for himself, allow Perpetua to detach a material and revive Bezel Ship from GY for additional card snatching later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>...Whew. That was a flowery description, I'll admit. But what did it accomplish? Well, we now have:</p><ul><li>Redoer whose materials grant it immunity to targeting effects (Raider's Wing) and non-targeting spin removal right out the gate (Power Reserve)</li><li>Perpetua to provide its fellow Xyz Monsters with additional/specific material types from deck for their respective effects</li><li>Bezel Ship to Tribute itself as a Quick Effect to steal the opponent's cards in GY(which can also provide them with specific material types for their different effects)</li><li>Power Reserve in GY once either Redoer or CDI detach it in order to banish itself and a card on field without targeting once your Xyz Monster(s) have both a Spell and Trap attached</li><li>Full-Armored Xyz in GY to both provide an Xyz Monster with the Force Strix in GY to act as a protective Spell and enable Dark Knight Lancer's effect to attach an opponent's monster as material</li></ul><p>Unconventional, sure, but capable of robbing many an opponent blind before they even realize what transpired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1hr23u84j9o"" style=""text-align: center;"">The Backup</h2><p>Of course, if the Thieves can spare the resources or need to pivot, their era-hopping escapades have afforded them allies from all over to clean up the job.</p><ul><li>Time Thief Double Barrel can respond to the opponent's actions like Redoer, albeit exclusively. Easily its most important is detaching a Trap to negate an Effect Monster on field's effects, keeping up the deck's trend of non-targeting in regards to the opponent's cards.</li><li>Abyss Dweller, meanwhile, takes care of decks that make extensive use of the GY as a second hand.</li><li>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless, aside from complimenting the deck's time motif, will most often detach both its materials to act as a walking Graceful Charity or Monster Reborn. Usually after you survive an opponent's turn and prepare to extend or drew into Soul Shave Force and Strangle Lanius in hand and need a backup route for a material-less Rank 4 to make Armor Fortress.</li><li>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir, fittingly nicknamed ""Plan B"", can act as an emergency button by locking non-Links into Defense and restricting their effects until brighter times shine. In Attack, you can also use it for battle destruction immunity in case you want to tag into Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder afterwards and wipe the field.</li><li>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future (promoted from its prior Utopic Future bearing just two Rank 4's) can act as a second CDI and source of ATK power in need. Gagagaga Magician can open the doors for its Summon by reviving a fellow Rank 4 in GY.</li><li>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops is my secret weapon as always, standing tall in the face of any non-Xyz Monster. It can steal an opponent's card on field to revive an Xyz Monster of yours in GY, so it's great if you need some extra muscle or to play the long game.</li><li>Gigantic ""Champion"" Sargas and its package of Springans Merrymaker and Therion ""King"" Regulus are available in the Side Deck in case any of my above Extra Deck features aren't your cup of tea. You know what these scallywags do, so get an extra dose of CDI in your system if you like.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1hr23u84k9p"" style=""text-align: center;"">Prior to Your Pilfering...</h2><p>...there's some extra stuff about the deck deserving of note, before alarm bells sound and it's down to every last resource rattling about your head and utility belt to make off like a bandit.</p><p>Small World is more or less needed in order to get to Regulator or Sakitama so Rank 4 setups are within reach. Admittedly the Spell is a pain to read, but can't argue with results. Some examples of bridges are:</p><ul><li>Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius -&gt; Sakitama -&gt; Any Time Thief monster</li><li>Effect Veiler or Droll &amp; Lock Bird -&gt; Raider's Wing -&gt; Sakitama</li></ul><p>You'll definitely want to gun for the first, i.e. Regulator as a result, however you can. I may not know every bridge, but that one is the most common for this deck.</p><p>Next, without Called by the Grave and Crossout Designator, suffice it to say that one Ash or Veiler tossed the way of your Regulator or Redoer and your heist is bound to end in seconds. Granted it's not the case for every opener, but you definitely want to have a response for disruptions like the above otherwise you'll be the one empty-handed rather than your opponent. Times like these make me wish Gamma was still at 2 - 3 so we could have Redoer banish himself and let Lambda search another Gamma to use later again.</p><p>Finally, Retrograde is what you'll tap into only if you either opened it or already got Power Reserve.
