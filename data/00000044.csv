Royal Magical Library + Numbers Eveil,"<p>Hello and welcome to another guide, where the aim is to FTK your opponent with Number 43. Rather than bot setup, this one can be considered as creative one. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KDhI_KtWo0"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Play your spells to fill your GY while drawing your combo pieces. Then, XYZ Summon Dugares and pass it to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"".</p><p>2) Activate ""Soul Absorption"". Then, activate ""Numbers Eveil"" to bring forth Number 43 with other XYZ monsters you have.</p><p>3) Although not shown, Lizardraw could have been destroyed to draw a card, provided there is another Performapal monster on other Pendulum Zone. With two free spaces you have, you could set ""That Wacky Magic!"" and play ""Contract with the Void"" to fill your GY with more spells. Then, activate ""That Wacky Magic!"" afterwards to banish all of your spells to gain lots of LP.</p><p>4) The amount you gained should be far more than your opponent's LP, even if you have played 3 x Upstart Goblin. Simply pull the trigger with Number 43 and win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be either found within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Soul Absorption"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" + ""Numbers Eveil"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Performapal Monkeyboard"" can be found within ""The Bizarre Playing Board"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 240 SR and 60 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Focused on revamping ace monsters <strong>Judgment Dragon</strong> and <strong>Punishment Dragon</strong>, and using boss monster <strong>Enlightenment Dragon</strong> as often as I can (with its <strong>Synchro Minerva</strong> combo as well as the <strong>Cross-sheep</strong> combo as extender). Great disruption improvements compared to the old Lightsworns, especially with omni-negate <strong>Lightsworn Aegis</strong> (2 is enough; sometimes 1 is even okay already). Side Deck mainly consists of suggested cards that you can also put to use (I am not focused on tweaking to adapt or disrupt opponents in between duels for this one, these are suggestions for your build). I also preferred the <strong>Bystials </strong>over the Tearlaments support since I can aim for the Level 10 Synchros and the recycling capability of <strong>Branded Regained</strong> instead of the engine milling and free fusion provided by the Tearlaments. Also, I have loved Lightsworns ever since I discovered them in 2009, and I've been using them since. I almost quit Yu-Gi-Oh! when they released almost useless cards post-Twilightsworns. I am glad Punishment Dragon is viable now, and a purer Lightsworn deck in general. Peace!</p>"

The two archetypes have <em>Fairy Monsters</em> and your focus is in a monster with attack bigger and Special Summon's effect.

Kash Fenrir is used to search the Tear Kash. Most plays involve around just playing tear unless mannadium lines are available. Though some times the mills are inconsistent in this version.

There's no banlist, but there's a limited list, which are all auto-includes, except for the 5 Exodia pieces. There's also a semi-limited list, which is only Swords and Card Destruction, the former an auto-include at 2, and the latter is a staple also usually at two.</p><p>Historic decks aside, Control represents the overwhelming majority of the meta, particularly with Soul Exchange, and with a mill variant relying on Card Destruction, and some Burn variants.</p><p>This list was made by compiling the decklists at the YGO Format Library, going through the top event decks and seeing what cards where used and how often. Some cards did not make the list, but should still be considered, and to note that these are not the exact card ratios you'd use, particularly Side-Board/Main-Board wise.</p><p>This list is meant as a starting point, these cards are used in the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the decks, usually in these quantities. The mainboard trap cards are used in every single deck at full playset and so are most of the cards mainboarded.</p><p>Sometimes not used as a full playset are Soul Exchange, Summoned Skull, Neo, Battle Ox, and Wall of Illusion. Everything else mainboarded and/or used as a full playset is invariably in these ratios distributed between main and side board.</p><p>Most decks will at least consider running 1 De-Spell, rarely 2, never 3. The Wicked Worm Beast and Trap Master are common deck at varying ratios. Aqua Madoor and Ultimate Offering are also usually run.</p><p>Of note is that even Aggro and Turbo decks will use most of these cards, with just some minor changes to account for their particular strategies (notably, Dragon Turbo will swap in Blue-Eyes and dragon support cards), so anyone wanting to get into the format work their way from here with a rock-solid foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Superheavy Samurai + Bystial,"<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>Apologies in advance if I did major mistakes while facing against Branded, as I'm still trying to do my best to learn.&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Branded_Lost"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Branded Lost</a>&nbsp;</strong>was surely painful to deal with.)</p><p>Greetings! I'm so excited to share with you all, my first serious rogue deck: Performapal Odd-Eyes. Here, SHS (Superheavy Samurai) utilizes Pendulum Tuners for Synchron plays while Bystials act as means of hand-trap and tutoring Odd-Eyes or Bystial cards because you can't use any Spell or Trap cards in SHS package. It's really shocking how all three are in harmony. So, let's begin!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wjq3-JcXw4g"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>(That was a wild ride for sure!)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>- Generally, Pendulum decks have no linear path. Depending on what you start with, your endboard may be different but try to aim placing Apollo as Link Monster and Baronne / Borreload / Dragster as Synchron Monster. One or two Synchron shall be enough. If possible, you can also Fusion Summon Vortex to finalize your negate city, where you need to block your opponent from doing anything mischievous.</p><p>- Your primary goal in the beginning should be utilizing Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon in Pendulum Zone, so that you can cheat out monsters. If you have Fusion Summoned Vortex and Vortex is in GY, always target Vortex to shuffle your opponent's Attack Positioned monster and have Spell/Trap/Monster negator ready.</p><p>- It all starts with Link 2 monsters. Have two bodies present onboard to either make Electrumite or Beyond. Using Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon (Pendulum Effect) + Bystials + Performapal Odd-Eyes Butler may help you in that regard.</p><p>- I'll try to do my best with explaining all three packages in different categories:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1) Performapal Odd-Eyes:</strong> While they are initially different archetypes, they have mutual relations. Some of members from this package are really scary if not unchecked...</p><ul><li>For example, if you have Normal/Special Summoned ""Performapal Celestial Magician"" while having Synchron Monsters, you can activate Celestial to not let your opponent activate any monster effects. If you have any Pendulum Monster present, Celestial can tutor any Pendulum Monster. Also, trivia; If you have Pendulum Synchron monster (Symphonic Warrior Rockks), Celestial checks both conditions that were previously explained.</li><li>Here are cards from this package, where you can place them in Pendulum Zone...<ul><li><strong>Performapal Gentrude:&nbsp;</strong>Either pop Gentrude on Pendulum Zone or as Monster card via Electrumite / Baronne to place any ""Performapal"" Pendulum monster except Gentrude later on.</li><li><strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Butler:&nbsp;</strong>If popped with Electrumite / Baronne as Monster card, Butler can be placed in Pendulum Zone.</li><li><strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Valet:&nbsp;</strong>If popped with Electrumite / Baronne as Monster card, Valet can be placed in Pendulum Zone.</li><li><strong>Performapal Ladyange:&nbsp;</strong>If Ladyange was sent to GY, either via Odd-Eyes Valet or Odd-Eyes Seer, you can place her in Pendulum Zone.</li></ul></li><li>Here are cards from this package, where you can cheat out Extra Deck monsters...<ul><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, you can revive Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon from your GY, if you have properly Fusion Summoned Vortex.</li><li><strong>Performapal Celestial Magician:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, if one of your Extra Deck monsters but Links were killed first time, you can pop Celestial to revive said monster. It means that if your Extra Deck monster was in your GY beforehand, you can't use Celestial again.</li><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, if there are any Extra Deck Dragon monsters except Links in your GY, you can revive said monster. Candidates are as follows...<ul><li>Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</li><li>Bystial Dis Pater</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Here are your tutors from this package...<ul><li><strong>Performapal Skullcrobat Joker:</strong> Normal Summon to find ""Performapal"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" or ""Magician"" monsters except Joker.</li><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, pop it to find any Pendulum Monster with &lt;= 1500 ATK.</li><li><strong>Performapal Monkeyboard:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, you can find Level 4- ""Performapal"" monster.</li><li><strong>Performapal Celestial Magician:&nbsp;</strong>If Normal/Special Summoned while having another Pendulum Monster, you can find any Pendulum Monster during your End Phase.</li><li><strong>Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer:&nbsp;</strong>If Special Summoned, pop up to two of your cards to find ""Performapal"" monsters but Sorcerer.</li><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Discard this fella and pay 500 LP to find either Arc Pendulum or Pendulum Dragon, Level 7 Dragon Pendulum Monsters. On a side note, if you have Normal/Special Summoned ""Oafdragon Magician"", you can fetch Revolution Dragon from your GY to your hand.</li><li><strong>Oafdragon Magician:&nbsp;</strong>As explained previously, you can either find ""Magician"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" monsters from your GY to fetch them into your hand. Mostly used for Revolution Dragon but you can also find any targets coming from Odd-Eyes Valet or Odd-Eyes Seer.</li></ul></li><li>Here is an example of starter: If you have Odd-Eyes Seer in hand...<ol><li>Normal Summon Skullcrobat Joker</li><li>Find Revolution Dragon</li><li>Use Revolution Dragon to find Arc Pendulum Dragon</li><li>Place Arc Pendulum Dragon and Odd-Eyes Seer to Pendulum Zones</li><li>Use Odd-Eyes Seer to pop Seer and fetch Revolution Dragon into your hand</li><li>Use Arc Pendulum Dragon to pull out ""Odd-Eyes"" monster from your Hand or Deck or GY...<ul><li>Don't bother with Hand unless you are forced.</li><li>Best GY target is Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon.</li><li>Best Deck target is Odd-Eyes Valet, followed by Odd-Eyes Dissolver. Valet can send Ladyange to GY, where you can place her into Pendulum Zone. Alternatively, Valet can send Butler to GY and you can pop either ""Performapal"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" Monster card you have to Special Summon Butler. If possible, detonate Pendulum Zone to not lose any bodies onboard. As for Dissolver, you can use Dissolver and any redundant Pendulum card on Pendulum Zone to Fusion Summon Vortex. Don't bother with Pendulum Effect of Dissolver, it's not worth doing it.</li></ul></li></ol></li><li>Via Odd-Eyes Seer, if Pendulum Summoned, do the following...<ul><li>Place as Defense &gt;&gt;&gt; Send Butler to GY for extra body or Ladyange for Pendulum Scale</li><li>Place as Attack &gt;&gt;&gt; Banish Odd-Eyes Seer &gt;&gt;&gt; Revive Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon or Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have come this far, congratulations. You have finally crossed the biggest hurdle. Rest shall be easy. If I have missed anything in ""Performapal Odd-Eyes"" section, let me know. Onwards to next one...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2) Superheavy Samurai (SHS)</strong></p><ul><li>At the cost of using no Spells or Traps, you can use Wakaushi to Special Summon it from Pendulum Zone while placing Big Benkei.</li><li>Your priority should be using Wakaushi with Level 6 monsters (Bystials + Odd-Eyes Seer + Oafdragon + Monkeyboard) to start the journey with Baronne and whatnot.</li><li>Feel free to do the math and explore other Synchro monsters. Even though Guitariss isn't a SHS monster, it's another Pendulum Tuner, where you can use Level 4 monsters to form Dragster / Pegasus / Rockks.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3) Bystial</strong></p><ul><li>These monsters can either give you extra bodies or act as hand-traps.</li><li>As Level 6 monsters, if combined with Wakaushi, can lead into Level 10 Synchro plays.</li><li>Since Bystials like to banish monsters, you can go extreme with cards such as Punisher + Omega + Chaos Angel + Chengying + Dis-Pater.</li><li>Lubellion can tutor any Bystial monster you like while Magnamhut can tutor any Dragon Monster, including Odd-Eyes Dragons, during the End Phase of a turn.</li><li>Baldrake and Druiswurm can act as means of disruption. Use them wisely.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this guide. If you have any questions or suggestions or feedback, feel free to write here. Most of all, have fun with playing Master Duel!</p>"

Some combo's and information about this deck and how to use it.<br />I find this deck is better to use on the 2nd turn, if you have to go first try and stall until your next turn.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>-Mecha Phantom Beast combo:</strong> Mecha Phantom Beast can special summon a token, you can use the Mecha Phantom Beast and the token to link summon Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll, use Chimera's effect to discard Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, then special summon a Gimmick monster from your hand.<br />Multiple possible scenario's after this combo.<br /><br />1-if you have Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler you can put that in defence position and use it's ability to stall for another turn provided you have spells and traps in your hand or set that you can use on there next turn that can protect it.<br /><br />2-if you have Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll and another gimmick puppet monster in your hand, discard 1 gimmick monster using Bisque Doll's effect, special summon in defence, use gimmick puppet dreary dolls effect in the graveyard banishing the discarded monster you just put in the graveyard, special summon dreary doll in defence, then you can special summon XYZ monsters.<br /><br />3-if you have Humpty Dumpty and Baby Terror, special summon Humpty and use its effect to special summon Terror Baby, XYZ summon into Gigantes Doll or Dreadnought Dreadnoid depending on your situation. If you oppenent has monsters on the field, best to summon Gigantes, steal 2 of there monsters, tribute Gigantes and make there levels 8 and XYZ summon either Gimmick Puppet of Strings or Giant Grinder. If they have spells/traps and a weak monster on the field use dreadnaught to XYZ summon Galaxy Destroyer and wipe there spells and traps.<br /><br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Des Troy/Humpty Dumpty/Dreary Doll combo:</strong> Normal Summon Des Troy, use its effect and destroy Des Troy to special summon 2 gimmick puppets monsters from your hand, special summon Dreary Doll and Humpty Dumpty, if you have another gimmick monster in your hand, use humpty dumptys effect to special summon that as well, then link summon Chimera using Dreary Doll and Humpty as the materials, add Shadow Feeler to your hand, special summon it, use dreary dolls effect in the graveyard, banish Des Troy and special summon Dreary Doll, XYZ summon into Giant Grinder or Puppet of Strings.<br />If you used Humpty Dumpty effect to special summon another Gimmick monster, special summon Terror Baby or another Humpty Dumpty, XYZ summon Gigantes, steal your opponents monster, use Gigantes effect make them level 8 and XYZ summon another Gimmick monster.<br /><br /><em><strong>(Monster Card Tips)<br /></strong></em><strong>-Gearspring Spirit</strong> is a easy to card to special summon when 1 machine monster is in the graveyard, good to get Rank 8 XYZ cards out.<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker</strong> is a safe card, just keep it your hand when a Gimmick monster gets destroyed by battle, can work with perform Puppet.<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Des Troy</strong> can easily special summon 2 Gimmick monsters from your hand.<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler </strong>is a great stall card, especially if they're being lazy and don't read it's effect.<br /><strong>-Dreary Doll/Bisque Doll/Magnet Doll</strong> are easy special summon cards to get out Rank 8 XYZ Monsters. Use Bisque Doll's effect, discard Dreary Doll and special summon Bisque, then use Magnet Dolls effect and special summon Magnet Doll, if they have no monsters on there field you can use Gearspring Spirit instead. Use Junk Puppet/Monster Reborn and Special summon Dreary from the graveyard, then link summon Chimera using Dreary Doll and Magnet Doll as link materials, use Chimera effect, add shadow feeler to hand, special summon it then use dreary effect in graveyard, discard Magnet Doll and special summon Dreary Doll for XYZ summons.<br /><br /><em><strong>(Spell/Trap tips)</strong></em><br /><strong>-Rank Up Spells&nbsp;</strong>Good for Puppet of Strings or Giant Grinder, easy board wipes against special summoned monsters.<br /><strong>-Dragon Nails</strong> Protects from Card effects that destroy the equiped monster plus a boost in attack, to get that otk wipe when you can get 2 XYZ's on one turn and have Chimera out.<br /><strong>-Perform Puppet</strong> good to banish cards then summon the banished cards<br /><strong>-Machine Duplication</strong> great for getting out Dreary Doll or Humpty Dumpty<br /><strong>-Puppet Parade</strong> is amazing for mass summoning when your oppenent has a lot of monsters on the field.<br /><strong>-Condolence Puppet</strong> good for sending Dreary Doll to the Graveyard to get a easy special summon and it can protect a XYZ card on the field if its in the graveyard.</p><p><em><strong>(XYZ Tips)</strong></em><br /><strong>-Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder</strong> is good when your oppenent has special summoned monsters on the field, summon it in defence. Use the effect twice and destroy 2 special summoned monsters on your oppenents field, if you have a ranked up spell use it after you use the effects, then XYZ summon Giant Hunter use the effect and destroy another Monster or spell/trap.<br /><strong>-Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings</strong> is a good board wipe if you have a ranked up spell card, use the effect and place string counters on your opponents monsters, use the rank up spell and XYZ summon Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings, dark strings effect will activate destroying your opponents monsters with string counters. (This all puts string counters on your monsters if you have any on the field, destroying them as well. So be careful when you do this)<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll</strong> is great for stealing your oppenents monsters and using them to XYZ summon for your extra deck<br /><strong>-Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</strong> is good when you can destroy the oppenents monster, then use its effect to XYZ summon Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer<br /><strong>-Number 68: Sanaphond The Sky Prison</strong> is great for stalling.

You can win the duel if you discard 3 XYZ materials this card has and you have no spell or trap cards on your field. Good end game card as well, especially if its in your graveyard, you have a rank up spell, junk puppet/monster reborn in your hand or perform puppet active on the field and you have 2000 life points or less. Use can use Junk Puppet/monster reborn to special it from your graveyard, use rank up on it, special summon Disaster Leo, detach the XYZ material, inflict 1000 damage and end your turn and win the duel.<br /><strong>-Number c88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo&nbsp;</strong>Better for end games and you have Gimmick Puppet of Leo in your graveyard.<br /><br /><em><strong>(Side Deck)</strong></em><br /><strong>-United we Stand</strong> gets you more attack than Dragon Nails, replace Dragon Nails for this card if you want more damage.<br /><strong>-Machina Cannon</strong> you can special summon by discarding 1 or more machine monsters from your hand (discard Dreary Doll) you can replace Twilight Joker or Twin Twisters for this card.<br /><strong>-Des Troy and Mecha Phantom Beast</strong> you can replace with Twilight Joker.</p>"

I'm running a budget friendly version for obvious reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here, you can see I run the infamous ""iffy"" tech card (according to the DM community), Palladium Oracle Mahad. What a lot of DM players don't realize (skill issue tbh) is that Mahad is a level 7 Light monster. Magician's Rod is a level 3 Dark monster. This means that if you can manage to Special Summon Mahad to your field with your Rod out (giggity), then you can make a Chaos Angel that's unaffected by your opponent's activated monster effects AND protects ALL of your monsters on the board from being destroyed by battle (WOW). Knowing that you can do this with PURE Dark Magician (who would've thought) and not have to run some cheesy engine that takes up deck space (and significantly lowers your pride &amp; self-respect) truly is a feeling like no other. Not to mention, a lot of the time, you can use him as an extra body for Link/XYZ plays (BLS/Big Eye), a Dark monster beat stick (because of his passive effect), cost for Timaeus, dump fodder for Souls in addition to the +1 he provides for Soul Servant. Nothing screams ""Giga Chad"" more than making Pot of Greed look obselete. Besides, more often than not, he'll stay in the Main Deck and if you manage to open him, use him for fusion with DM or put him back on top of the deck with Illusion of Chaos. Let's not forget he can also do everything mentioned IN ADDITION to just being a MUCH stronger version of Magikuriboh with his 3rd effect. He can also be Special Summoned from the GY via Master of Chaos's effect and tributed to non-target banish ALL of your opponent's monsters from the field (his utility is so versatile). Dark Magician players tend to look everywhere for support except for their own archetype (crazy, isn't it) which is why Mahad is so slept on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Honorable mention goes out to Ebon High. I prefer High over Illusion simply because High can play Traps and Quick-Plays from hand during your opponent's turn. Let's say opponent activates a card to pop one of the floodgates in the back row; upon the resolution of that effect, I can discard 1 material and activate another INSTANTLY. Then, if he gets sent to the GY for whatever reason, I can Special Summon a Dark Spellcaster body from deck and non-target pop 1 card on field. That Special Summon can be ANY of the Dark Spellcaster monsters in your deck (of ANY LEVEL as long as they can be Special/Normal Summoned). Once upon a time for me, that choice was most often going to be DMoC (but because of the 4 bricks I already run and absolutely having to Normal Summon him, he's just too much of a liability...super fun to do though). Unfortunately, because I RARELY ever have a chance to make Ebon High and flex these big brain plays, I just choose to go with Big Eye because his materials are super generic (not that it actually matters in a Level 7 Spellcaster deck tbh) and his effect is just a free Snatch n Steal x2 with no LP gain for opponent (unga bunga gimme your body to make more monsters).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dragostapellia, Borrelsword, Linkmail, and the Knightmare cards are just generic filler cards that I use to fill up Extra Deck space. I mean, they're alright (insert that one meme). I don't need Phoenix because I choose to run the SEARCHABLE in-archetype Harpie's Feather Duster (because you can tech it with Illusion of Chaos for essentially a free search+add to hand). It sure beats running 5-7 EXTRA cards that don't synergize with Dark Magician like Talent/Thrust just to search Harpie's (I swear that idea makes no sense to me...just play DM Pure and use the space for other cards) and its 2nd effect is not worth it. Chaos Angel does it way better. Unicorn is meh at best (really mid card for 3 bodies tbh). I probably won't even need Dragoon either. I typically do pretty well without it in my deck on Master Duel. However, I'm open to testing him out and seeing if he'll be worth adding to my deck when I do finally obtain a copy or two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Floodgates are what I'll be mainly running in my deck due to how much it will (typically) stop my opponent. Meta-contending decks tend to have multiple attributes/types and need to summon more than twice to have a solid board. If I end up learning that my match-up can play around any of them, then I can easily just Special Summon Magicians' Souls and send them to the GY for a free Pot of Greed (synergy...gotta love it). However, because I don't currently have access to Souls, I won't be running any floodgates (seldom Summon Limit because DM can easily set up with 2 summons) because I'll pretty much have no way to get them off my field when I need to cook. Also, because I opt to run Eternal Soul in my deck, my opponent will have more incentive to go for the floodgate(s) which means Eternal Soul is potentially safe (at least long enough for me to make Dragon Knight).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You might also notice the lack of the staple hand traps/interruptions such as Ash, Nib, Droll or anything in likeness. That's not how I intend to play the deck containing the ultimate wizard in terms of attack and defense. I have a bone to pick with modern YGO and how it's played. The farthest I will go down the hand trap rabbit hole is Imperm and Evenly (if we even consider that a hand trap).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eclipse &amp; Moon are self-explanitory. So are Widowmaker, Dark Ruler, the Runick Spells and Spellbound (they're just flat-out ""no's"" to your opponent).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I'm able to obtain more of the cards I typically run (<a href=""/deck/dark-magician-365881"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see my Master Duel Dark Magician deck on my profile</a>), I will most likely be swapping out some of the current cards you see with those.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I currently don't run a side deck because I don't have enough cards to make a fully fleshed out one nor do I truly think I'll need one. If I do end up making one, I'll add those cards to the decklist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the other cards I plan on obtaining (list below), I'll get them when and if I'm in a position to do so. I wouldn't be running budget DM if I didn't have to. I'll remove each from the list once I obtain them. If you find yourself reading this, and end up meeting me somehow, I'm open to trading (or if you simply just want to hook me up, that'd be pretty sick too, but it's necessary).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cards I Plan On Adding Eventually</strong>:</p><p>- 1x Chaos Angel</p><p>- 1x Guardian Chimera</p><p>- 3x Magicians' Souls</p><p>- 1x Number 11: Big Eye</p><p>- 1x Accesscode Talker</p><p>- 1x Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</p><p>- 1-3x Skill Drain</p><p>- 1-3x Rivalry of Warlords</p><p>- 1-3x Gozen Match</p><p>- 1-3x Summon Limit</p><p>- 3x Evenly Matched</p><p>- 3x Infinite Impermanence</p><p>- 3x Preperation of Rites (waiting on that to come in mail)</p><p>- 1x Artemis (waiting on that to come in mail)</p><p>- 1x Magician Salvation (waiting on that to come in mail)</p><p>- 1x Millennium-Eyes Restrict</p>"

Less players are playing into Super Polymerization and it might work better as a side card if they expect our extra deck to be mainly Links and Branded fusions. Never made Earth Golem @Ignister once, so I think that slot is cuttable. I'd likely side in a Dharc over that slot in the future if not cutting the entire Super Poly targets. Jowgen in main is a possible idea, though setting up a proper VV board already feels very strong. Did not miss Ash in the main. Never felt Droll was necessary. Different Dimension Ground was essentially an auto-win against any Snake-eye deck, so I definitely would side more of those. Never saw Summon Limit any time I sided into it, so I can't say if DDG is better than Summon Limit there, but often opponents would play around tripping Tactics on my turn, so I don't think DDG as a Thrust target was too relevant.&nbsp;</p>"

Big eye and Barronne can be substituted for Mereologic Aggregator and Malong, respectively, as these cards have effects when used for Ultimate Slayer. Barrone is great in simplified game states. Dyna Mondo helps you to recycle materials if you have already used Radiance, but I don't have enough data to decide on whether I want the second copy.&nbsp;</p><p>If you decide to run a link climbing package with the use of charmers and selene, you could cut the Goddess, either the Linkuriboh or Almiraj, and the Draco-Equiste/@ignister or both if you want to run more than 1 charmer. IF you do decide to go this route, you would probably cut Fenrir for Veiler as Selene requires you to special the spell caster in denese position. The trade-off to this is that it plays into TTT. Going the link climbing package also lets you trade out the Ulti Slayers for something like Evenly Matched</p><p>You could easily go into the Nadir package with the way extra deck is designed. I would just add an extra Garura to keep your Super Poly plays alive while being able to draw a card.</p><p>Still experimenting with some combination of Fenrir/Nib/Droll. Fenrir is definitlely the better card when going first; however, Nibiru is defenitely a better card to be drawn in case you lose the die roll. Nib can be used if the ritual spell is hard drawn and you have no access to Safira immediately since the spell does require a LIGHT attribute tribute(s). Fenrir going second is also a trigger for Promethian Princess so it can be sided out for either Duster/ Lightning Storm/ ECon depending on the matchup. I think TTT is too good to not be in the main this format and wanted it in any capacity. It gives you infomation on your oppenents hand if you do get drolled going first and is a draw 2 in case your Prosperity or Pre-Prep is Ashed. You could just cut it completely and play the 3rd copy of Pre-Prep to keep the deck at a clean 40.&nbsp;</p><p>Econ also triggers Diviner's effect to get access to Lo, since it tributes for cost even if Diviner is negated and dodges destruction. Lightning Storms can be swapped out for Cosmic Cyclones if you are seeing more Centurion and Floodgates. Anti-Spell checks a lot of the spell heavy decks right now and can just outright win you a game.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I learned of a cool tech involving droplet that can play around imperm which is cool, also ghastly glitch can dump the Evil-twins boss monster if you have one of the links on the field, or onibi. Running some Xyz to play around cards like D-barrier. Pank can help deal with established boards without getting in the way of the Ki-sikil and Lil-La cyberse monster's effects. E-con works really well when you tribute one of the links cause you can summon the tributed monster back and if you tributed Lil-la, you can pop a card in adittion to grabbing an oponent's monster.</p>"

Synchro zone is a cool tech pick and there is a combo you can do wtih gravity collapse as well, but it costs too much space in the deck and is unsearchable. I am running an extra deck that is pretty wrym heavy obviously, but there are some nice choices like adamancipator and barrone. PeP is also a neat choice, but strategist Longyuan burns so it isn't very nice, but it is a great option for busting out of near losses and its a guilty pleasure to play. Summit allows for a lot of extensions when drawn so it is increadibly good for recovering and pushing advantage though its not that nice to draw multiple of. Same reason we are running a Vessel, if you draw Taia you can dump a card for him to get a token plus some tenyi banishment extensions. Heavenly dragon circle allows for playing through interuption, same with droplet. Abyss dragon is good in this format if your opponent sets up a fire king island or the labrynth field spell. Though if your opponent isn't playing any of those then Iris allows you to play a bit during your opponents turn, plus I pulled a 25th of her so I am partial.</p><p>Extra deck is kinda weird, I mentioned the non-wryms that I am playing, I think they work very well in this deck, but I am only playing 1 Sinister because a lot of FZire decks play the charmer and thats killer if your opponent gets him. If they are playing fire, Chengying is a good because against sword soul you have a bit of graveyard interuption, kinda, but he is also a water that can't be stolen, plus 10 plus the level 1 adhara goes into PeP. The yangzing cards are good for extending your plays and helping you win over the board state going second, like in Baxia's case. I decided to run an abyss dweller because a lab deck may be running D-barrier, plus if you can't get to a synchro for whatever reason it can do a number interupting your opponents graveyard plays with fire king and snake-eyes.</p>"

I think instead of the Weighbridge, E-con, and Safe-zones I can try putting the Terror root cards in. I really like how those cards play and I think they are interesting, plus the new Afteroot card might make them more consistent to set up ( Wannabee! helps too). Shadow-Imprisoning mirror is also really good at dealing with specific decks like Chaos, Unchained, and Lab, and it doesn't affect your deck except for number 96, who I would replace with Zeus, Accescode, or the charmer. Since you aren't garunteed those match-ups, I play them in the side.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a different way of playing yugioh than what I normally run, but I like the Otter and the Melffys so I think this'll be a go to deck for me whenever I want to play a more casual game.</p>"

If you have extenders beyond Ash (like Jet Synchron, One for One, or Snake-Eyes Divine Temple) you can also end on Heatsoul's draw 2, Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf's recovery from the GY of a fire monster (like Ash Blossom)! Next turn, you can OTK easily with tons of link material to finish the game with the likes of Accesscode Talker. Remember this is from 1 card, so your hand may also contain one to several of the 15 handtraps!</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, the Snake-Eyes strategy features a ton of handtraps to weaken your opponent's gamestate or potentially end their turn on a suboptimal board so you can start comboing yourself. As you combo up, you can methodically remove your opponent's field using Flamberge Dragon's non-destruction removal, Knightmare Phoenix's S/T destruction, Knightmare Unicorn's shuffle, and Accesscode can be made for up to 3 pops due to the different attribute link material in the GY (dark-Linkuriboh, fire-Knightmake Phoenix, light-Selene),&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><p style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p><ul style=""text-align: left; list-style-type: disc;""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Snake-Eyes does a lot of actions that involves having no monsters on the field - meaning that Psy-Frame Gamma is almost always live! Alot of players on ladder leave their Ash Blossom for the Original Sinful Spoils summoning a card from deck, and since the card leaves your field empty, you can Gamma their Ash Blossom! When that interaction happens, people usually leave.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you manage to summon Gamma + Driver on your turn, you can summon Borreload Savage Dragon for an additional negate. Just be sure your GY is set up with a link monster! A cool interaction is that you can also send to the GY the equipped link monster to the GY as the cost of your Snake-Eye cards!</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you lose out on the Maxx ""C"" minigame, try to end your board on Flamberge Dragon. For the price of allowing your opponent to draw 1 more card, you can end on a 3000 ATK body and follow-up for next turn since the card floats into your searchers in the GY.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Hiita and Dharc can summon a monster from your opponent's GY (for example, summon your opponent's Ash Blossom or D.D. Crow) and you can either make Selene (typically for Accesscode) or more importantly, Promethean Princess. if your GY is already set-up, this play allows you to get back to your gameplan by summoning a crucial Fire monster from the GY, like Snake-Eyes Ash, Poplar or Flamberge Dragon.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you have Snake-Eyes Ash and you drew into Original Sinful Spoils already, when you search with Poplar take Snake-Eyes Divine Temple instead so that it's an additional extender. The extra card in the backrow serves as an extender for your Snake-Eyes cost to send a card on the field to the GY.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Snake-Eyes summons so many times (even on the opponent's turn!) that you'd sometimes find yourself in the awkward position of having no more space on your board! Be careful of this scenario. A good way to get around this situation during your opponent's turn is to link away as much monsters as possible for I:P Masquerena.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Since all your interruption is centered around your monsters, be careful about your Apollousa being stolen by your opponent (happens surprisingly a lot). A ""talents"" or change of heart on your Apollousa is often devastating and is enough to break your board since you'll be facing down your own mass negates.&nbsp;</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">You'll encounter a lot of Snake-Eye mirror matches on ladder. When facing a rival Snake-Eyes player, negate your opponent's Flamberge Dragon, especially by using Crossout or Called By the Grave. This prevents their target removal of your cards and severely limits their link spam. Also, try to prevent your opponent&nbsp;from summoning or using Hiita, since she can also use your entire GY with all it's effect monsters!</span></div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>Want to see the deck in action?

You get to reap the benefits! Idk how many copies of Imperm he has, but it really is the best handtrap, especially for these birbs. If you have to, sub copies with Effect Veiler. He was using Evenly Matched, but the battle phase is basically this deck's win condition. You don't wanna give your opponent the chance to field bigger numbers.</p><p>I was originally going to pass up on Glorious Bright, but after pulling one, I realized a searchable negate is EXACTLY what RRs needed, and it's now searchable with Brave Strix.

Overall you don't have really bad match ups, Branded being threatened by the toolbox induced by the Ice Barrier engine.</p><p>This variant selling points are it's draw power (draw 7 first turn) with more stability and resilience than the Fur Hire one. Indeed it can easily play around Droll and Nibiru, and generally whistand multiple hand traps. The multiple searchers and extenders means you have a fair number of lines, making opponnent's hand traps more difficult to time and value, you can also directly synchro climb without Runick bodies. Finally the ability Ice Barrier has to make a Crocodragon for 4 in one card is a huge asset to grind in go second games since you can use your entire hand to climb boards then just draw a new one.</p><p>Like other Runick variant you definitely don't like Shifter and Droplet, even if your draw power will be a good way to finish your turn with wide combination of Runicks and survive the last mentioned. Part of your basic boards takes Super Poly, but you can play around if the card is a thing. The Voiceless Voice match up by itself isn't bad but can be a lot more difficult if your opponent has double Barrier, as it will cut the interactive side of your Runick spells and prevent your SP to ban 1 on the board.</p>"

A&nbsp;&nbsp;reinterpretation of a possible curry deck for Kabayama/Sartyr from Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, fighting as Curry Mask. Since basically all of his monsters, including his boss Curry Fiend Don Roux, and his Spice cards, don't exist, I've reformatted the deck into a Plant beatdown hybrid deck, using all the most tasty vegetables Curry Mask could find.</p><p>In place of his Spices, Curry Mask now uses Aroma monsters, specifically Marjoram (Bay Leaf), Bergamot and Rosemary, three aromatic herbs you might find used in curry recipies. His new boss monster is Aromalilith Magnolia, because a fragrant, aromatic vegetarian dish feels like an appropriate replacement for Curry Fiend Don Roux.</p><p>Everything else is pretty self-explanatory, though I would have liked to include Spy-C-Spy because obviously it's curry based, but it interferes with Solidarity.</p>"

Trag has lots of different Lv options for stealing monsters, etc.<br /><br />Side Deck is full of cards I'd like to find room for, (e.g. Monk can pitch extra Field spells for Water or Minefielddriller, Shrink to help FL Dark or get more damage in, Gate for removal/FL Light plays, Nobleman for anti-meta plus can target Set FL Light, Trade-In for Gadjiltron Dragon/Beast King, Foolish/Kinka/Call for more GY shenanigans, Compulse for Synchro's and more FL Light plays and so on), but deck is already so tight so unsure what cuts to make.</p>"

Just try to imagine your usual Snake-Eyes deck but with more draw power, consistency, but with less handtraps and with more Runick cards (they kind of function like handtraps/boardbreakers anyways). Shoutout to the OG Runick mastermind Joshua Schmidt to inventing and teaching me, one of his stream viewers this strategy - ultimately inspiring me to make this article/video.&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">After your usual Runick shenanigans (Draw 3 with Runick Fountain), you go for full Snake-Eyes combo complete with I:P Masquerena, Flamberge Dragon, Promethean Princess and Amblowhale. This strategy generally has extra bodies due to the Runick spells all functioning ""Instant Fusion,"" so most hands can end on a board with Heatsoul as well! Runick cards double as boardbreakers we well, allowing them to be used as your opening salvo to simplify your opponent's gamestate, so you can full combo with Snake-Eyes. In addition to searches, this deck can draw an obscene total of up to 6 cards during your turn and your opponent's turn (3 with Runick Fountain, 2 with Heatsoul and 1 with WANTED:Seeker).&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Even if your opponent stops one side of your strategy (say they ash Hugin so you can't search Fountain), you can always pivot to the other archetype (Snake-Eyes) and full combo since all their handtraps/interactions are already used up! Remember, Fountain allows you to draw up to 3 cards and a singular uninterrupted Snake-Eyes Ash is a net +8 so your opponent will get out-resourced either way!&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Soon enough, you'll be out-grinding &nbsp;your opponent while controlling their strategy to death! Runick Snake-Eyes also inherently a lot of attack power on board due to the immense link summoning powerhouse that is Snake-Eyes combined with Runick's extenders, so you can even push for game after your battle phase skip!&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">An interesting interaction of Runick and Snake-Eyes is that The Original Sinful-Spoils, Snake-Eye Ash, Snake-Eye Oak and Worldsea Dragon Zealantis can clear your Extra Monster Zone of its Runick Fusion monster, so you can keep summoning more Runick monsters through your spells. This would allow more chances to activate Runick Spells for a possible extra couple draws with Runick Fountain while simultaneously providing extenders to link summoning. Both decks inherently synergize with each other, allowing for more resources to be generated from both Runick and Snake-Eye strategies.&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Runick adds extra power to Snake-Eye's monster-based interactions since it adds novel variety to the interruptions available to the deck - Runick's quick play spells! In addition to Promethean Princess' pop, Apollousa's 2-4 monster negates and Linkuriboh's monster protection, your opponent will have to deal with the plethora of toolbox quick-play spells in your hand. This means that even cards like Evenly Matched, Dark Ruler No More or a Nibiru boardwipe can cannot completely finish you since you can lean back to either your Runick or Snake-Eye cards.&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Runick is simple to use enough and its been around for a couple years now, so there is no explanation needed there. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""/deck/wanted-seekers-of-masters-1-guide-to-snake-eye-february-2024-442326"">For a more detailed guide on Snake-Eyes, click here for my earlier article on the strategy.&nbsp;</a><br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You wanna be drawing level 5's in that case for the hand, best choices are 3x Thunder Dragon (consistency/cost both met) alongside a pair of Cyber Dragons and 3x Sirocco for the Vayu stuff; that helps with board pressure and to make the Escapes less dead in hand.</p><p>The targets for Eccentric are generally cards that are going to be a mix of being good with/without their effects. Archfiend is 3k already so that's a plus regardless. There's a good mix of cards available that I'd dare say it becomes more of a toolbox if you can get at least one of them out and banished, especially ones like Thought Ruler or Dark End which are both also valid targets for the strat. It's certainly not amazing yet for the gimmick it works, not many decks can throw out pressure like that with one or two cards required.&nbsp;</p><p>The build otherwise is pretty inoffensive. Chaos Sorc admittedly is a bit jank in here however with all of the targets available it was never a brick when it got drawn so I can't say much else about it. Legacy copies are there to actually see the plays more with the additional upside of maybe baiting out removal in the right conditions. Side Board was mostly just generic. Virus with Eccentric targets is possible; requires a bit too much resource-wise to be viable sadly. Maybe another time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

You can also use The White Stone of Ancients and The White Stone of Legend to search for Blue-Eyes White Dragon and its variants, which can help you summon powerful synchro and xyz monsters. Dragon Core Hexer is a level 8 tuner that can be used to synchro summon Giganticastle, a level 9 monster with 3100 ATK that can beat Tri-Horned Dragon in a battle. Skill Drain is a trap card that can negate the effects of all face-up monsters on the field, which can give Tri-Horned Dragon an advantage over most monsters.</span></p>"

You might need to double up on Statues with Winds banned (I recommend Inferno rn).&nbsp;So open with your Performapals, set those scales (without Skullcrobat, he can only pendulum clowns), hopefully you've drawn into 2+ Statues, pendulum, then draw Exodia for win. GGEZ. Maybe throw some other shit into the extra deck, idk. Millennium Cross is an alternative to BSs since you clearly can't do both. If that's too bricky, check the side deck. And if you wanna make this deck totally illegal, max out Monkeyboard and throw in Stormwinds.</p><p>Oh, and if you don't like BSs, there's Heat Wave in the side deck, along with alternate draw engines. You can cycle Ladyange with Odd-Eyes Seer, but you can't use her draw with Morganite.</p>"

All of your cards work together to draw you into engine or hand traps and end with an endboard of some flavor of Alba Zoa, Quem, Branded in Red and maybe Regained.</p><p>Space for handtraps is at a premium so it's your discretion what the most impactful choices are. Veiler and Nib play well with Fusion and Lulu.</p><p>Apkallone was originally Psy-Framelord Omega since you could make that theoretically, but Ariel does better what I wanted Omega to do.</p><p>Duality is incredible because you will often end with Maximus on board doing nothing and if your opponent can't kill you that turn they will prioritize removal on Maximus, so making them waste something on Maximus only to tribute it away for Dragoons is often the end of the game. Also turns Granguignol into Dragoons and Granguignol can still activate in grave.</p>"

However, you don't want to play a gamble deck or a coin toss deck...for very obvious reasons. So, is there any possible way to turn the zero into a hero? Yes, thanks to an incredibly broken card and THE POWER OF WALT DISNEY'S TOMMOROWLAND!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Behold, the greatest thing to ever happen the Time Wizard: A Fusion Card. <img class=""card-editor-tooltip-image"" src=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26273196.jpg"" alt=""image"" title=""Time Wizard of Tomorrow (26273196)"" loading=""lazy"" data-card=""26273196"" />This magnificent card is the pinnacle of Time Wizard's potential. How? Simple: the material required is Time Wizard and ANY effect monster. So, of course, we are gonna slap Super Polymerization in the deck and laugh all the way to the end of time. Now, your opponents will have PTSD flashbacks of the time their Chengying got turned into the greatest wizard in all of time!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So....what else are we doing to support him? Adding Witchcrafters of course! These spellcasters already have wonderful synergy with Time Wizard thanks to their type, and he can be used for most of their cards!! Just grind out your opponents with Witchcrafter effects and spell recycling! Honestly, that's how you'll win 90% of your games, but that ONE GAME where you Super Polymerization with Time Wizard will be the talk of your locals!!! (Yes, we have other actually good Super Poly targets as well, but who cares?)</p><p>If you do find that THE MIGHTY TIME WIZARD isn't enough, just side him and super poly out for whatver you need. Or bring in Boarder and Summon Limit and watch EVERYONE HATE YOU!!! Good luck!!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The main concept/ combo of the archtype doesnt utilize its normal summon, with the main normal summon targets being Priestess. Deck has great swarm potential and great board presence with all of its special summons. The incorporation of the Kashtira package is mainly to get bigger bodies on board for OTK's, with the combination of set rotation to get field spells out quickly (Pressured Planet for search or Obsidim to extend).</p><p>HFD, Called By The Grave, and Crossout Designator are the first cards to be considered as flex spots depending on match-ups versus Snake-Eys, FK, and back row decks. A budget alternative for the deck would be to swap the 3 Bonfire with Pot of Prosperity as deck is not super reliant on extra dexk but great resource with TY-Phon just being a quick threat and a bunch of removal options that are mostly accessible. Baronne easy access with combonation of ghost girls normal summon + lvl 7/ Effect Veiler normal + Veidos.</p><p>Open to suggestions or feedback. One thing to consider is the possibility of dead hands with number of hand traps/ interruptions added as there is not much support for initial Ashened release. Agnimal Candle could be swapped for Droll/Ash Blossom as an easy bonfire search target for free extender and a modular tuner for easy syncro. Chaos Angel could also be viable as Ashened monsters are all dark.</p>"

The goal is to get Zaborg the Mega Monarch and Escalation of the Monarchs. If unable, the other Monarchs can do. You'll be setting up a generic Evil Twin board while setting backrow, and if the stars poorly align, you'll pull off Sunny Snitch then activate Escalation of the Monarchs to tribute over the Evil Twins on board to summon Zaborg.

Psychic Processor is the bread and butter, we're essentially playing 6 copies with Emergency Teleport.&nbsp;</p><p>Allure of Darkness to deep draw, Kozmotown to get them back. Stuck with a heavier Dark lineup as opposed to the regular ratios of ships to pilots.&nbsp;</p><p>Only the single Psychic Arsenal since we're already playing three and three of Eclipser and Dark Destroyer, and it makes Dark Planet searchable.</p><p>Dark Planet is more of the flex spot, rarely ever summon it but hey it's there- trying to make it work.</p><p>Originally I wanted to make a more Psychic based variant but none of them are very good, you'd be better off playing FireKing Kozmo but even then that's bad by todays standards (I haven't tested it with the new Fire King support though)</p><p>I basically traded off the usual playstyle of Kozmo Wincan (Tincan) in favour of big ships.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck still OTKs extremely easily, any combination of a single Dark Destroyer + Other Ship or Farmgirl means game if you can connect with Farmgirl once.&nbsp;</p><p>Trap Tracks is MVP of the deck, pop a ship with it and you get the float effect and whatever trap you want. I'm of the opinion that Storm Kings Return is probably the best recursion trap when compared to Back to the Front and the new Emergency Apport trap. Since SKR returns the summoned monster to your hand you can revive something then let it return to your hand and re-summon it with another pilot.&nbsp;</p><p>Extra deck can be whatever you want, was originally testing Extravagance but it conflicted way too much with Kozmotown's mulligan effect.</p><p>Card Destruction is there just for digging, would be better in a Psychic variant since you could Soartroopers for Strawman then Strawman for a ship.</p><p>Let me know what you think, give it a try.

Also it is unnafected by almost every main monster in the current metagame. It is an auto winner ! ! !&nbsp;</p><p>MAIN PLAYS:</p><ul><li>""Duza"" is the MVP because it can search any cubic monster (Cubic Karma), become a monster negator (Cubic Wave), a monster recover (Cubic Dharma), a combo starter (Unification), or became a muscle guy via its own effect</li><li>""Foolish Burial Goods"" work the same way as ""Duza"", so it is usually an starter or even a extender</li><li>""Vijam"" is a good barriage to stall against attacks and a negator. It is also good to start some link plays with ""Relinquished Anima"" (and trigger an ""Unification"" from grave to start the combos), or smash a ""Super Starslayer TY-PHON"" when in trouble</li><li>""Forbidden Droplet"" is very OP in this deck. It can send your Cubic cards to the grave so that you stun your opponent and trigger your combos</li><li>""Super Polymerization"" is nuts, works in the same way as ""Forbidden Droplet"", allowing you to boardwipe your opponent and begin your combos</li></ul><p>SUPPORT PLAYS:</p><ul><li>""Reasoning"" is gold in this deck, because you don't play a lot of monsters and you want your Cubic spells/traps in the graveyard to enable your main plays. The better comes when you can special summon a monster, specially if it is a ""Duza"", allowing some crazy combos&nbsp;</li><li>""Slash Draw"" has multiple roles aside from draw power: It can discard a Cubic card; it can send multiple cards from your deck; it can recover your most valuable spells from grave (like ""Lightning Storm"", ""Super Polymerization"", ""Instant Fusion"", ""Reasoning"", etc.)</li><li>""Instant Fusion"" can be your second ""Called by the Grave"": Special summon ""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"" and be protected against hand traps or the disruptions from your opponent's monsters, then you could use it to start your link plays with your other monsters</li><li>The ""Charmers"" link monsters are pretty OP , they can be an auto-link 4 summon. Take advantage of your opponent monsters to extend your combos, or to boardwipe the field with a one-card ""Topologic Zeroboros"" (if you previously had a ""Unification"" in the graveyard)</li><li>""Gizmek Taniguku"" is a very fun tech that can recycle your ""Duza"" for the long plays, so, you want it in the graveyard almost all the time&nbsp;</li></ul><p>PROS:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The ""surprise"" factor allows to smash unaware opponents</li><li>Unnafected boss monster that can autowin games&nbsp;</li><li>A toolbox that can play around into many perilous games</li><li>This version of the deck boardwipes ! ! !&nbsp;</li></ul><p>CONS</p><ul><li>Very susceptible to backrow heavy decks</li><li>It tends to consume its resources very fast, if you don't win by turn 2 - 4, you're pretty dead&nbsp;</li><li>This version of the deck relies on the Extra Deck.

Among these alliances, the countries of the BRICS group stood out - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Together, these countries sought greater global influence and greater independence in relation to Western countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the scenes, Brazil began to follow a dangerous path, marked by greed, power and manipulation. The Brazilian leadership saw partnerships with China and Russia as an opportunity to expand its influence and strengthen its economy, but at the same time it saw a threat in being just another member of the BRICS group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With diplomatic skill and strategic coolness, Brazil began to adopt a stance of apparent neutrality, while actually working behind the scenes to undermine the trust of its Chinese and Russian partners. Through subtle manipulations and political articulations, Brazil managed to deceive the world, presenting itself as a country that is an ally of everyone, but in reality seeking only its own benefit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through privileged information and subtle blackmail, Brazil managed to obtain commercial and political advantages from both the Western and Eastern sides, playing a dangerous and dishonest game. While China and Russia invested time, money and resources in partnerships with Brazil, Brazil took advantage of the situation to strengthen its own position and undermine the confidence of its partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brazil will be exposed as a traitor, a manipulator who seeks only its own benefit to the detriment of its allies. The other countries in the BRICS group will feel betrayed and deceived, realizing that Brazil was never a true ally, but rather an unscrupulous opportunist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lesson that remains is clear: never trust Brazil. Its false neutrality and diplomatic manipulations show that this country is capable of anything to achieve its objectives, even if it means betraying the trust of its partners. It is necessary to be alert and vigilant in a world where loyalty is increasingly rare.</p>"

This is my first time posting here and I'm still figuring things out, hopefully it's not too bad.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">I played&nbsp;<strong>a lot&nbsp;</strong>YuGiOh!-Decks over the course of time and whilst I love many deck themes like Visas Starfrost and everything World Legacy related, also other things like Salamangreats and Marincesses, I can't say I ever fell in love with a deck quite as much as Yubel and her way of doing things.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">When I started playing YuGiOh! around 5 years ago again and trying to get into it again, I went trough all the deck themes that there are and Yubel immediately shot into my memories again. I loved her character story back then in GX and her effect is actually quite interesting even tho not really playable. Not even as material for Neos Fusion, as Neos Kluger did not exist back then. Nontheless, I did set up a weired Fireking Version playing Yubel and till this day never actually played it. Which might be better.&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Long story short, after wishing for a Structure Deck for her for a long time, I finally.. Did not get that. But instead, we got tons of very good support and even more to come in the future! But let's keep it at Phantom Knightmare state for now. The version after Legacy of Destruction will come later and should we ever get the fusion monster of her that is currently just a OCG exclusive promo-card, then this will go absolutely Mount Everest.</p><hr /><p style=""text-align: left;"">Anyway, let's begin!</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">This is my&nbsp;<strong>pure</strong> version of the deck and revolves all around Yubel and her other versions which I will call ""alts"" from now on, inflicting reflective battle damage to your opponent and controlling the field. There are currently 5 versions of her:</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=78371393"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78371393.jpg"" data-card=""78371393"" data-name=""Yubel"">Yubel</span></a> - A fiend with 0/0 ATK &amp; DEF, Lvl 10 and the effect that she can't be destroyed by battle, which is the same with all other Yubel-alts. If she's destroyed anywhere by card effect, you can trigger her effect in the graveyard or banish staple and summon her alt #2. If she's attacked by an opponents monster, the opponent gets the damage instead. In&nbsp;<strong>your</strong> endphase, you must pay a maintenance cost of tributing one monster, or else she's destroyed. This however will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> trigger her own floating effect.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=4779091"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/4779091.jpg"" data-card=""4779091"" data-name=""Yubel - Terror Incarnate"">Yubel - Terror Incarnate</span></a> - Her second alt, same stats but Lvl 11 has the same battle protection and no maintenance cost. Instead, she destroys all other monsters on the field during the endphase. If your opponent attacks her, she inflicts burn damage to your opponent just like the normal Yubel.&nbsp;<strong>When&nbsp;</strong>this face-up card leaves the field, it summons the 3rd alt from anywhere. Unfortunately, it says when and not if- That means it misses a lot of timing. This card must leave the field as the last thing that happens, otherwise it won't trigger. Means, you can't link her away and by that trigger her effect, even one of the new cards does not work with her. Yet.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=31764700"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/31764700.jpg"" data-card=""31764700"" data-name=""Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare"">Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare</span></a> - Her third alt and the probably weakest one when it comes to defence. Same stats, Lvl 12 this time. No floating but the ability to destroy a monster that you attack (or that attacks her) after battle and inflict the attack points of said monster as battle damage.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=90829280"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/90829280.jpg"" data-card=""90829280"" data-name=""Spirit of Yubel"">Spirit of Yubel</span></a> - One of her new alts and probably one of the best cards in the deck. Original statline again and luckily Lvl 10. It summons itself on opponents attack declaration and either adds to your hand or sets it directly from your deck, a spell or trap card that mentions ""Yubel"". It also floats on destruction from anywhere into the original Yubel. Keep in mind, this floating is <strong>not</strong> once-per-turn.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=47172959"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/47172959.jpg"" data-card=""47172959"" data-name=""Yubel - The Loving Defender Forever"">Yubel - The Loving Defender Forever</span></a> - Her for now final alt, the big bad bossmonster and probably the only real ""Boss-Monster"" this deck even needs. 0/0 ATK &amp; DEF, Lvl 12. A fusion monster that requires one Yubel-alt + X Effect-Monsters on the field. Yes, that means you can use Super Polymerisation to fuse up to 12 monsters on the field. She cannot be destroyed by either card effect or battle and also inflicts burn damage on summon = 500 x the amount of fusion material used for it's summoning. So this burn damage can range from 1000 to 6000. If something attacks her or she attacks something, your opponent receives burn damage after the damage step = the ATK of the opponents monster and right after, the monster is banished.</p><hr /><p style=""text-align: left;"">Now that we know everything about Yubel and her alternative versions, we go over the other new cards.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=62318994"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/62318994.jpg"" data-card=""62318994"" data-name=""Samsara D Lotus"">Samsara D Lotus</span></a> - A retrain of the original Samsara Lotus (which can also be used in this deck to a certain extend, I guess...?) The D Lotus; to which I will refer as Samsara Lotus from now on) is an extender, starter and control tool, the very first ""pseudo-negate"" that this deck offers and currently the only one. It's a level 1 fiend with 0/0 ATK &amp; DEF that can be tributed as cost, to special summon a Yubel monster from the deck. Keep in mind, due to their summoning restrictions, this works only on the original Yubel and Spirit of Yubel. Most of the time, you wanna summon the latter with it. In grave it can either special summon itself during the End Phase or get onto your hand, as long as you control the original Yubel. Make sure to trigger Samsara Lotus first and then Yubel, to use it as fodder to keep her alive. It's your End Phase after all, you can decide what triggers first. It's 3rd effect is a pseudo negate, you can tribute it while controlling the original Yubel to make an activated opponents monster's effect become ""Destroy one Yubel-monster on the field instead"".</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=26913989"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26913989.jpg"" data-card=""26913989"" data-name=""Geistgrinder Golem"">Geistgrinder Golem</span></a> - A retrain of the original Grinder Golem. You either reveal it on your hand together with a Yubel-monster and special summon it to the opponents field, then if the revealed monster was Spirit of Yubel or the original one, you can special summon it to your side of the field. This sets you up for attacking your opponent, even if his field is empty. If the Golem is in your grave, you can also special summon it when the original Yubel is special summoned. On the field, it heals your opponent (talking from your opponents view here) for 3000 LP whenever a Yubel attacks it. Later more to that.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=65261141"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/65261141.jpg"" data-card=""65261141"" data-name=""Nightmare Pain"">Nightmare Pain</span></a> - Yubels partner in crime. It's a permanent spell card and throws back all battle damage at your opponent, that you would have from battles with your Yubel-monsters. This applies&nbsp;<strong>before</strong> Yubels countless effects. Means Yubel, Terror Incarnate, Ultimate Nightmare and Loving Defender will inflict double damage. Attack An opponents 3000 ATK monster with Ultimate Nightmare and your opponent will receive net worth of 6000 damage. It's active effect is that you can destroy a DARK monster in your hand or on your field to add Yubel or a card that mentions her to your hand from your deck, except itself. Keep in mind, the destruction is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> a cost.&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=92650749"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/92650749.jpg"" data-card=""92650749"" data-name=""Mature Chronicle"">Mature Chronicle</span></a> - A retrain of Spell Chronicle, it's a permanent spell that collects ""Chronicle Counters"" whenever a monster is special summoned, that is or mentions Yubel, to either side of the field. You can then once per turn remove Chronicle Counters from&nbsp;<strong>anywhere</strong> on the field to activate one of its effects.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">1. - Special summon the original Yubel from your graveyard.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">2. - Banish a card from your deck.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">3. - Add a banished card to your hand.

The latter effect needs you to send it to the graveyard tho as well as a card from the hand. That is a cost, so your opponent can't destroy it to hinder you from fusing, he can however negate it. Then you lost two cards. It's still a very good card and should be in every Yubel based deck.

You might have noticed, that theY all share the fiend-type, 0/0 ATK &amp; DEF statline. This opens us a huge door to another seemingly forgotten in-time archetype: Sacred Beasts.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">It's time to shine for them and holy cracker, they do.

Let's go trough them.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=81034083"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/81034083.jpg"" data-card=""81034083"" data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</span></a> - A Lvl 2 fiend with the Yubel statline, it searches you Raviel, Uria or Hamon (those are the Sacred Beasts) or whatever card they mention. Those are a lot, but theres really only one that is important in this version of Yubel. It also let's us do a second normal summon on a fiend with 0/0 ATK &amp; DEF, so it works well with either itself or with the new Samsara Lotus.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=80312545"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/80312545.jpg"" data-card=""80312545"" data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</span></a> - A permanent spell card that is not an attraction in some adventure park. On activation, it searches us one of the Sacred Beasts or one monster that mentions them from your deck to your hand. It then remains on the field and can revive us any fiend with the Yubel statline, the cost is discarding one card. You do not declare a target here before you actually do the revive. Instead, you must have a valid target on activation in the graveyard, so it won't work with an empty GY. However, it will work to discard the same card you are going to revive. The third effect lets you add a permanent spell to your hand from your GY, as long as you control at least one Lvl 10 monster. It's nice for keeping up your recourses if your opponent for example destroys your Nightmare Pain.</p><hr /><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 18pt;""><em><strong>The Unchained Engine</strong></em></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">People love the Unchained-Engine in this deck.

During your opponents main phase, it serves as a Quick-Link-Summon with a special summoned monster our opponent controls, into a DARK link monster.

I'm not TeamShinobi and tell you that it's&nbsp;<strong>tHe nEw tIeR zErO dEcK</strong>. I mentioned Kashtira earlier, due to them banishing face-down. This can break your neck. Not always, but sometimes.

Mostly due to it Main Decking D-Shifter. This one makes you unable to use Forbidden Droplet. The deck can also be fairly open to hand-rip effects. If your opponent takes away your keycard before you can use it, then that might be problematic. I look at things like Voiceless Voice and Chimera.</span></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">What are this decks strengths?</span></em></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">First of all, you have a ton of ""problem solvers"". Cards that you put on the field and the opponent simply cannot do anything against it. Examples are your Kaiju's and your Lava Golems, Forbidden Droplet as well as Super Polymerisation. Another big strength is that the deck plays pretty well trough before mentioned insta-win cards like Shifter and Droll. Your GY is not nessecarily needed, often you can also just pass your turn. Most (Omni)negates negate and then destroy ythe card after.

Droll is fairly easy to play around as well as you often set cards instead of adding them to your hand.</span></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The probably biggest threat currently is ""Snake-Eye"".

I'm not sure if this is necessarily better than the other Zombie list, though, given cards like Krebons and Psychic Commander have utility even if you dead draw them. On the contrary, drawing a second Diva is akin to drawing a Garnet. Even still, it is interesting to play around with as both Zombie variants have their strengths.&nbsp;</p><p>I've also been considering playing around with other card in this deck such as Il Blud, a third Diva alongside Spined Gillman (which would allow easy access to Mist Wurm as you'd only need to have a level four monster - something easily accomplishable with Instant Fusion and Darkfire Dragon - at the ready and a Diva in hand to bring it out), and so forth but feel this might be the most consistent list at the moment.</p><p>Nevertheless, more testing is needed for both this and the other deck utilizing the Emergency Teleport package.&nbsp;</p><p>I've also made the choice to cut Doomkaiser for Thought Ruler as the latter seems to be more useful more often. The deck pays a lot of life points, after all, which Thought Ruler aids in restoring but that plays second fiddle to the fact that Thought Ruler can aid in allowing you to go on the offensive or even close out games without fear of Dimensional Prison, which I believe is the most common battle trap in the format, and the like.</p><p>While Doomkaiser dominates against another Zombie deck, I feel that's akin to switching out Darkfire for Karbonala Warrior to premptively prepare for Koaki Meiru Drago which is commonly used in Dragon lists.&nbsp; Perhaps I should consider placing Extra Deck monsters in the Side Deck, after all, but that's an idea for another time.</p>"
