Royal Magical Library + Numbers Eveil,"<p>Hello and welcome to another guide, where the aim is to FTK your opponent with Number 43. Rather than bot setup, this one can be considered as creative one. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KDhI_KtWo0"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Play your spells to fill your GY while drawing your combo pieces. Then, XYZ Summon Dugares and pass it to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"".</p><p>2) Activate ""Soul Absorption"". Then, activate ""Numbers Eveil"" to bring forth Number 43 with other XYZ monsters you have.</p><p>3) Although not shown, Lizardraw could have been destroyed to draw a card, provided there is another Performapal monster on other Pendulum Zone. With two free spaces you have, you could set ""That Wacky Magic!"" and play ""Contract with the Void"" to fill your GY with more spells. Then, activate ""That Wacky Magic!"" afterwards to banish all of your spells to gain lots of LP.</p><p>4) The amount you gained should be far more than your opponent's LP, even if you have played 3 x Upstart Goblin. Simply pull the trigger with Number 43 and win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be either found within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Soul Absorption"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" + ""Numbers Eveil"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Performapal Monkeyboard"" can be found within ""The Bizarre Playing Board"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 240 SR and 60 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Focused on revamping ace monsters <strong>Judgment Dragon</strong> and <strong>Punishment Dragon</strong>, and using boss monster <strong>Enlightenment Dragon</strong> as often as I can (with its <strong>Synchro Minerva</strong> combo as well as the <strong>Cross-sheep</strong> combo as extender). Great disruption improvements compared to the old Lightsworns, especially with omni-negate <strong>Lightsworn Aegis</strong> (2 is enough; sometimes 1 is even okay already). Side Deck mainly consists of suggested cards that you can also put to use (I am not focused on tweaking to adapt or disrupt opponents in between duels for this one, these are suggestions for your build). I also preferred the <strong>Bystials </strong>over the Tearlaments support since I can aim for the Level 10 Synchros and the recycling capability of <strong>Branded Regained</strong> instead of the engine milling and free fusion provided by the Tearlaments. Also, I have loved Lightsworns ever since I discovered them in 2009, and I've been using them since. I almost quit Yu-Gi-Oh! when they released almost useless cards post-Twilightsworns. I am glad Punishment Dragon is viable now, and a purer Lightsworn deck in general. Peace!</p>"

The two archetypes have <em>Fairy Monsters</em> and your focus is in a monster with attack bigger and Special Summon's effect.

Kash Fenrir is used to search the Tear Kash. Most plays involve around just playing tear unless mannadium lines are available. Though some times the mills are inconsistent in this version.

There's no banlist, but there's a limited list, which are all auto-includes, except for the 5 Exodia pieces. There's also a semi-limited list, which is only Swords and Card Destruction, the former an auto-include at 2, and the latter is a staple also usually at two.</p><p>Historic decks aside, Control represents the overwhelming majority of the meta, particularly with Soul Exchange, and with a mill variant relying on Card Destruction, and some Burn variants.</p><p>This list was made by compiling the decklists at the YGO Format Library, going through the top event decks and seeing what cards where used and how often. Some cards did not make the list, but should still be considered, and to note that these are not the exact card ratios you'd use, particularly Side-Board/Main-Board wise.</p><p>This list is meant as a starting point, these cards are used in the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of the decks, usually in these quantities. The mainboard trap cards are used in every single deck at full playset and so are most of the cards mainboarded.</p><p>Sometimes not used as a full playset are Soul Exchange, Summoned Skull, Neo, Battle Ox, and Wall of Illusion. Everything else mainboarded and/or used as a full playset is invariably in these ratios distributed between main and side board.</p><p>Most decks will at least consider running 1 De-Spell, rarely 2, never 3. The Wicked Worm Beast and Trap Master are common deck at varying ratios. Aqua Madoor and Ultimate Offering are also usually run.</p><p>Of note is that even Aggro and Turbo decks will use most of these cards, with just some minor changes to account for their particular strategies (notably, Dragon Turbo will swap in Blue-Eyes and dragon support cards), so anyone wanting to get into the format work their way from here with a rock-solid foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Superheavy Samurai + Bystial,"<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>Apologies in advance if I did major mistakes while facing against Branded, as I'm still trying to do my best to learn.&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Branded_Lost"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Branded Lost</a>&nbsp;</strong>was surely painful to deal with.)</p><p>Greetings! I'm so excited to share with you all, my first serious rogue deck: Performapal Odd-Eyes. Here, SHS (Superheavy Samurai) utilizes Pendulum Tuners for Synchron plays while Bystials act as means of hand-trap and tutoring Odd-Eyes or Bystial cards because you can't use any Spell or Trap cards in SHS package. It's really shocking how all three are in harmony. So, let's begin!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wjq3-JcXw4g"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><em>(That was a wild ride for sure!)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>- Generally, Pendulum decks have no linear path. Depending on what you start with, your endboard may be different but try to aim placing Apollo as Link Monster and Baronne / Borreload / Dragster as Synchron Monster. One or two Synchron shall be enough. If possible, you can also Fusion Summon Vortex to finalize your negate city, where you need to block your opponent from doing anything mischievous.</p><p>- Your primary goal in the beginning should be utilizing Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon in Pendulum Zone, so that you can cheat out monsters. If you have Fusion Summoned Vortex and Vortex is in GY, always target Vortex to shuffle your opponent's Attack Positioned monster and have Spell/Trap/Monster negator ready.</p><p>- It all starts with Link 2 monsters. Have two bodies present onboard to either make Electrumite or Beyond. Using Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon (Pendulum Effect) + Bystials + Performapal Odd-Eyes Butler may help you in that regard.</p><p>- I'll try to do my best with explaining all three packages in different categories:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1) Performapal Odd-Eyes:</strong> While they are initially different archetypes, they have mutual relations. Some of members from this package are really scary if not unchecked...</p><ul><li>For example, if you have Normal/Special Summoned ""Performapal Celestial Magician"" while having Synchron Monsters, you can activate Celestial to not let your opponent activate any monster effects. If you have any Pendulum Monster present, Celestial can tutor any Pendulum Monster. Also, trivia; If you have Pendulum Synchron monster (Symphonic Warrior Rockks), Celestial checks both conditions that were previously explained.</li><li>Here are cards from this package, where you can place them in Pendulum Zone...<ul><li><strong>Performapal Gentrude:&nbsp;</strong>Either pop Gentrude on Pendulum Zone or as Monster card via Electrumite / Baronne to place any ""Performapal"" Pendulum monster except Gentrude later on.</li><li><strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Butler:&nbsp;</strong>If popped with Electrumite / Baronne as Monster card, Butler can be placed in Pendulum Zone.</li><li><strong>Performapal Odd-Eyes Valet:&nbsp;</strong>If popped with Electrumite / Baronne as Monster card, Valet can be placed in Pendulum Zone.</li><li><strong>Performapal Ladyange:&nbsp;</strong>If Ladyange was sent to GY, either via Odd-Eyes Valet or Odd-Eyes Seer, you can place her in Pendulum Zone.</li></ul></li><li>Here are cards from this package, where you can cheat out Extra Deck monsters...<ul><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, you can revive Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon from your GY, if you have properly Fusion Summoned Vortex.</li><li><strong>Performapal Celestial Magician:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, if one of your Extra Deck monsters but Links were killed first time, you can pop Celestial to revive said monster. It means that if your Extra Deck monster was in your GY beforehand, you can't use Celestial again.</li><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, if there are any Extra Deck Dragon monsters except Links in your GY, you can revive said monster. Candidates are as follows...<ul><li>Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</li><li>Bystial Dis Pater</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Here are your tutors from this package...<ul><li><strong>Performapal Skullcrobat Joker:</strong> Normal Summon to find ""Performapal"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" or ""Magician"" monsters except Joker.</li><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, pop it to find any Pendulum Monster with &lt;= 1500 ATK.</li><li><strong>Performapal Monkeyboard:&nbsp;</strong>Only from Pendulum Zone, you can find Level 4- ""Performapal"" monster.</li><li><strong>Performapal Celestial Magician:&nbsp;</strong>If Normal/Special Summoned while having another Pendulum Monster, you can find any Pendulum Monster during your End Phase.</li><li><strong>Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer:&nbsp;</strong>If Special Summoned, pop up to two of your cards to find ""Performapal"" monsters but Sorcerer.</li><li><strong>Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Discard this fella and pay 500 LP to find either Arc Pendulum or Pendulum Dragon, Level 7 Dragon Pendulum Monsters. On a side note, if you have Normal/Special Summoned ""Oafdragon Magician"", you can fetch Revolution Dragon from your GY to your hand.</li><li><strong>Oafdragon Magician:&nbsp;</strong>As explained previously, you can either find ""Magician"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" monsters from your GY to fetch them into your hand. Mostly used for Revolution Dragon but you can also find any targets coming from Odd-Eyes Valet or Odd-Eyes Seer.</li></ul></li><li>Here is an example of starter: If you have Odd-Eyes Seer in hand...<ol><li>Normal Summon Skullcrobat Joker</li><li>Find Revolution Dragon</li><li>Use Revolution Dragon to find Arc Pendulum Dragon</li><li>Place Arc Pendulum Dragon and Odd-Eyes Seer to Pendulum Zones</li><li>Use Odd-Eyes Seer to pop Seer and fetch Revolution Dragon into your hand</li><li>Use Arc Pendulum Dragon to pull out ""Odd-Eyes"" monster from your Hand or Deck or GY...<ul><li>Don't bother with Hand unless you are forced.</li><li>Best GY target is Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon.</li><li>Best Deck target is Odd-Eyes Valet, followed by Odd-Eyes Dissolver. Valet can send Ladyange to GY, where you can place her into Pendulum Zone. Alternatively, Valet can send Butler to GY and you can pop either ""Performapal"" or ""Odd-Eyes"" Monster card you have to Special Summon Butler. If possible, detonate Pendulum Zone to not lose any bodies onboard. As for Dissolver, you can use Dissolver and any redundant Pendulum card on Pendulum Zone to Fusion Summon Vortex. Don't bother with Pendulum Effect of Dissolver, it's not worth doing it.</li></ul></li></ol></li><li>Via Odd-Eyes Seer, if Pendulum Summoned, do the following...<ul><li>Place as Defense &gt;&gt;&gt; Send Butler to GY for extra body or Ladyange for Pendulum Scale</li><li>Place as Attack &gt;&gt;&gt; Banish Odd-Eyes Seer &gt;&gt;&gt; Revive Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon or Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have come this far, congratulations. You have finally crossed the biggest hurdle. Rest shall be easy. If I have missed anything in ""Performapal Odd-Eyes"" section, let me know. Onwards to next one...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2) Superheavy Samurai (SHS)</strong></p><ul><li>At the cost of using no Spells or Traps, you can use Wakaushi to Special Summon it from Pendulum Zone while placing Big Benkei.</li><li>Your priority should be using Wakaushi with Level 6 monsters (Bystials + Odd-Eyes Seer + Oafdragon + Monkeyboard) to start the journey with Baronne and whatnot.</li><li>Feel free to do the math and explore other Synchro monsters. Even though Guitariss isn't a SHS monster, it's another Pendulum Tuner, where you can use Level 4 monsters to form Dragster / Pegasus / Rockks.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3) Bystial</strong></p><ul><li>These monsters can either give you extra bodies or act as hand-traps.</li><li>As Level 6 monsters, if combined with Wakaushi, can lead into Level 10 Synchro plays.</li><li>Since Bystials like to banish monsters, you can go extreme with cards such as Punisher + Omega + Chaos Angel + Chengying + Dis-Pater.</li><li>Lubellion can tutor any Bystial monster you like while Magnamhut can tutor any Dragon Monster, including Odd-Eyes Dragons, during the End Phase of a turn.</li><li>Baldrake and Druiswurm can act as means of disruption. Use them wisely.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this guide. If you have any questions or suggestions or feedback, feel free to write here. Most of all, have fun with playing Master Duel!</p>"

Some combo's and information about this deck and how to use it.<br />I find this deck is better to use on the 2nd turn, if you have to go first try and stall until your next turn.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>-Mecha Phantom Beast combo:</strong> Mecha Phantom Beast can special summon a token, you can use the Mecha Phantom Beast and the token to link summon Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll, use Chimera's effect to discard Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll, then special summon a Gimmick monster from your hand.<br />Multiple possible scenario's after this combo.<br /><br />1-if you have Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler you can put that in defence position and use it's ability to stall for another turn provided you have spells and traps in your hand or set that you can use on there next turn that can protect it.<br /><br />2-if you have Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll and another gimmick puppet monster in your hand, discard 1 gimmick monster using Bisque Doll's effect, special summon in defence, use gimmick puppet dreary dolls effect in the graveyard banishing the discarded monster you just put in the graveyard, special summon dreary doll in defence, then you can special summon XYZ monsters.<br /><br />3-if you have Humpty Dumpty and Baby Terror, special summon Humpty and use its effect to special summon Terror Baby, XYZ summon into Gigantes Doll or Dreadnought Dreadnoid depending on your situation. If you oppenent has monsters on the field, best to summon Gigantes, steal 2 of there monsters, tribute Gigantes and make there levels 8 and XYZ summon either Gimmick Puppet of Strings or Giant Grinder. If they have spells/traps and a weak monster on the field use dreadnaught to XYZ summon Galaxy Destroyer and wipe there spells and traps.<br /><br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Des Troy/Humpty Dumpty/Dreary Doll combo:</strong> Normal Summon Des Troy, use its effect and destroy Des Troy to special summon 2 gimmick puppets monsters from your hand, special summon Dreary Doll and Humpty Dumpty, if you have another gimmick monster in your hand, use humpty dumptys effect to special summon that as well, then link summon Chimera using Dreary Doll and Humpty as the materials, add Shadow Feeler to your hand, special summon it, use dreary dolls effect in the graveyard, banish Des Troy and special summon Dreary Doll, XYZ summon into Giant Grinder or Puppet of Strings.<br />If you used Humpty Dumpty effect to special summon another Gimmick monster, special summon Terror Baby or another Humpty Dumpty, XYZ summon Gigantes, steal your opponents monster, use Gigantes effect make them level 8 and XYZ summon another Gimmick monster.<br /><br /><em><strong>(Monster Card Tips)<br /></strong></em><strong>-Gearspring Spirit</strong> is a easy to card to special summon when 1 machine monster is in the graveyard, good to get Rank 8 XYZ cards out.<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker</strong> is a safe card, just keep it your hand when a Gimmick monster gets destroyed by battle, can work with perform Puppet.<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Des Troy</strong> can easily special summon 2 Gimmick monsters from your hand.<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler </strong>is a great stall card, especially if they're being lazy and don't read it's effect.<br /><strong>-Dreary Doll/Bisque Doll/Magnet Doll</strong> are easy special summon cards to get out Rank 8 XYZ Monsters. Use Bisque Doll's effect, discard Dreary Doll and special summon Bisque, then use Magnet Dolls effect and special summon Magnet Doll, if they have no monsters on there field you can use Gearspring Spirit instead. Use Junk Puppet/Monster Reborn and Special summon Dreary from the graveyard, then link summon Chimera using Dreary Doll and Magnet Doll as link materials, use Chimera effect, add shadow feeler to hand, special summon it then use dreary effect in graveyard, discard Magnet Doll and special summon Dreary Doll for XYZ summons.<br /><br /><em><strong>(Spell/Trap tips)</strong></em><br /><strong>-Rank Up Spells&nbsp;</strong>Good for Puppet of Strings or Giant Grinder, easy board wipes against special summoned monsters.<br /><strong>-Dragon Nails</strong> Protects from Card effects that destroy the equiped monster plus a boost in attack, to get that otk wipe when you can get 2 XYZ's on one turn and have Chimera out.<br /><strong>-Perform Puppet</strong> good to banish cards then summon the banished cards<br /><strong>-Machine Duplication</strong> great for getting out Dreary Doll or Humpty Dumpty<br /><strong>-Puppet Parade</strong> is amazing for mass summoning when your oppenent has a lot of monsters on the field.<br /><strong>-Condolence Puppet</strong> good for sending Dreary Doll to the Graveyard to get a easy special summon and it can protect a XYZ card on the field if its in the graveyard.</p><p><em><strong>(XYZ Tips)</strong></em><br /><strong>-Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder</strong> is good when your oppenent has special summoned monsters on the field, summon it in defence. Use the effect twice and destroy 2 special summoned monsters on your oppenents field, if you have a ranked up spell use it after you use the effects, then XYZ summon Giant Hunter use the effect and destroy another Monster or spell/trap.<br /><strong>-Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings</strong> is a good board wipe if you have a ranked up spell card, use the effect and place string counters on your opponents monsters, use the rank up spell and XYZ summon Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings, dark strings effect will activate destroying your opponents monsters with string counters. (This all puts string counters on your monsters if you have any on the field, destroying them as well. So be careful when you do this)<br /><strong>-Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll</strong> is great for stealing your oppenents monsters and using them to XYZ summon for your extra deck<br /><strong>-Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</strong> is good when you can destroy the oppenents monster, then use its effect to XYZ summon Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer<br /><strong>-Number 68: Sanaphond The Sky Prison</strong> is great for stalling.

You can win the duel if you discard 3 XYZ materials this card has and you have no spell or trap cards on your field. Good end game card as well, especially if its in your graveyard, you have a rank up spell, junk puppet/monster reborn in your hand or perform puppet active on the field and you have 2000 life points or less. Use can use Junk Puppet/monster reborn to special it from your graveyard, use rank up on it, special summon Disaster Leo, detach the XYZ material, inflict 1000 damage and end your turn and win the duel.<br /><strong>-Number c88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo&nbsp;</strong>Better for end games and you have Gimmick Puppet of Leo in your graveyard.<br /><br /><em><strong>(Side Deck)</strong></em><br /><strong>-United we Stand</strong> gets you more attack than Dragon Nails, replace Dragon Nails for this card if you want more damage.<br /><strong>-Machina Cannon</strong> you can special summon by discarding 1 or more machine monsters from your hand (discard Dreary Doll) you can replace Twilight Joker or Twin Twisters for this card.<br /><strong>-Des Troy and Mecha Phantom Beast</strong> you can replace with Twilight Joker.</p>"

I'm running a budget friendly version for obvious reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here, you can see I run the infamous ""iffy"" tech card (according to the DM community), Palladium Oracle Mahad. What a lot of DM players don't realize (skill issue tbh) is that Mahad is a level 7 Light monster. Magician's Rod is a level 3 Dark monster. This means that if you can manage to Special Summon Mahad to your field with your Rod out (giggity), then you can make a Chaos Angel that's unaffected by your opponent's activated monster effects AND protects ALL of your monsters on the board from being destroyed by battle (WOW). Knowing that you can do this with PURE Dark Magician (who would've thought) and not have to run some cheesy engine that takes up deck space (and significantly lowers your pride &amp; self-respect) truly is a feeling like no other. Not to mention, a lot of the time, you can use him as an extra body for Link/XYZ plays (BLS/Big Eye), a Dark monster beat stick (because of his passive effect), cost for Timaeus, dump fodder for Souls in addition to the +1 he provides for Soul Servant. Nothing screams ""Giga Chad"" more than making Pot of Greed look obselete. Besides, more often than not, he'll stay in the Main Deck and if you manage to open him, use him for fusion with DM or put him back on top of the deck with Illusion of Chaos. Let's not forget he can also do everything mentioned IN ADDITION to just being a MUCH stronger version of Magikuriboh with his 3rd effect. He can also be Special Summoned from the GY via Master of Chaos's effect and tributed to non-target banish ALL of your opponent's monsters from the field (his utility is so versatile). Dark Magician players tend to look everywhere for support except for their own archetype (crazy, isn't it) which is why Mahad is so slept on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Honorable mention goes out to Ebon High. I prefer High over Illusion simply because High can play Traps and Quick-Plays from hand during your opponent's turn. Let's say opponent activates a card to pop one of the floodgates in the back row; upon the resolution of that effect, I can discard 1 material and activate another INSTANTLY. Then, if he gets sent to the GY for whatever reason, I can Special Summon a Dark Spellcaster body from deck and non-target pop 1 card on field. That Special Summon can be ANY of the Dark Spellcaster monsters in your deck (of ANY LEVEL as long as they can be Special/Normal Summoned). Once upon a time for me, that choice was most often going to be DMoC (but because of the 4 bricks I already run and absolutely having to Normal Summon him, he's just too much of a liability...super fun to do though). Unfortunately, because I RARELY ever have a chance to make Ebon High and flex these big brain plays, I just choose to go with Big Eye because his materials are super generic (not that it actually matters in a Level 7 Spellcaster deck tbh) and his effect is just a free Snatch n Steal x2 with no LP gain for opponent (unga bunga gimme your body to make more monsters).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dragostapellia, Borrelsword, Linkmail, and the Knightmare cards are just generic filler cards that I use to fill up Extra Deck space. I mean, they're alright (insert that one meme). I don't need Phoenix because I choose to run the SEARCHABLE in-archetype Harpie's Feather Duster (because you can tech it with Illusion of Chaos for essentially a free search+add to hand). It sure beats running 5-7 EXTRA cards that don't synergize with Dark Magician like Talent/Thrust just to search Harpie's (I swear that idea makes no sense to me...just play DM Pure and use the space for other cards) and its 2nd effect is not worth it. Chaos Angel does it way better. Unicorn is meh at best (really mid card for 3 bodies tbh). I probably won't even need Dragoon either. I typically do pretty well without it in my deck on Master Duel. However, I'm open to testing him out and seeing if he'll be worth adding to my deck when I do finally obtain a copy or two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Floodgates are what I'll be mainly running in my deck due to how much it will (typically) stop my opponent. Meta-contending decks tend to have multiple attributes/types and need to summon more than twice to have a solid board. If I end up learning that my match-up can play around any of them, then I can easily just Special Summon Magicians' Souls and send them to the GY for a free Pot of Greed (synergy...gotta love it). However, because I don't currently have access to Souls, I won't be running any floodgates (seldom Summon Limit because DM can easily set up with 2 summons) because I'll pretty much have no way to get them off my field when I need to cook. Also, because I opt to run Eternal Soul in my deck, my opponent will have more incentive to go for the floodgate(s) which means Eternal Soul is potentially safe (at least long enough for me to make Dragon Knight).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You might also notice the lack of the staple hand traps/interruptions such as Ash, Nib, Droll or anything in likeness. That's not how I intend to play the deck containing the ultimate wizard in terms of attack and defense. I have a bone to pick with modern YGO and how it's played. The farthest I will go down the hand trap rabbit hole is Imperm and Evenly (if we even consider that a hand trap).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eclipse &amp; Moon are self-explanitory. So are Widowmaker, Dark Ruler, the Runick Spells and Spellbound (they're just flat-out ""no's"" to your opponent).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I'm able to obtain more of the cards I typically run (<a href=""/deck/dark-magician-365881"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see my Master Duel Dark Magician deck on my profile</a>), I will most likely be swapping out some of the current cards you see with those.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I currently don't run a side deck because I don't have enough cards to make a fully fleshed out one nor do I truly think I'll need one. If I do end up making one, I'll add those cards to the decklist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for the other cards I plan on obtaining (list below), I'll get them when and if I'm in a position to do so. I wouldn't be running budget DM if I didn't have to. I'll remove each from the list once I obtain them. If you find yourself reading this, and end up meeting me somehow, I'm open to trading (or if you simply just want to hook me up, that'd be pretty sick too, but it's necessary).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cards I Plan On Adding Eventually</strong>:</p><p>- 1x Chaos Angel</p><p>- 1x Guardian Chimera</p><p>- 3x Magicians' Souls</p><p>- 1x Number 11: Big Eye</p><p>- 1x Accesscode Talker</p><p>- 1x Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</p><p>- 1-3x Skill Drain</p><p>- 1-3x Rivalry of Warlords</p><p>- 1-3x Gozen Match</p><p>- 1-3x Summon Limit</p><p>- 3x Evenly Matched</p><p>- 3x Infinite Impermanence</p><p>- 3x Preperation of Rites (waiting on that to come in mail)</p><p>- 1x Artemis (waiting on that to come in mail)</p><p>- 1x Magician Salvation (waiting on that to come in mail)</p><p>- 1x Millennium-Eyes Restrict</p>"

Less players are playing into Super Polymerization and it might work better as a side card if they expect our extra deck to be mainly Links and Branded fusions. Never made Earth Golem @Ignister once, so I think that slot is cuttable. I'd likely side in a Dharc over that slot in the future if not cutting the entire Super Poly targets. Jowgen in main is a possible idea, though setting up a proper VV board already feels very strong. Did not miss Ash in the main. Never felt Droll was necessary. Different Dimension Ground was essentially an auto-win against any Snake-eye deck, so I definitely would side more of those. Never saw Summon Limit any time I sided into it, so I can't say if DDG is better than Summon Limit there, but often opponents would play around tripping Tactics on my turn, so I don't think DDG as a Thrust target was too relevant.&nbsp;</p>"

Big eye and Barronne can be substituted for Mereologic Aggregator and Malong, respectively, as these cards have effects when used for Ultimate Slayer. Barrone is great in simplified game states. Dyna Mondo helps you to recycle materials if you have already used Radiance, but I don't have enough data to decide on whether I want the second copy.&nbsp;</p><p>If you decide to run a link climbing package with the use of charmers and selene, you could cut the Goddess, either the Linkuriboh or Almiraj, and the Draco-Equiste/@ignister or both if you want to run more than 1 charmer. IF you do decide to go this route, you would probably cut Fenrir for Veiler as Selene requires you to special the spell caster in denese position. The trade-off to this is that it plays into TTT. Going the link climbing package also lets you trade out the Ulti Slayers for something like Evenly Matched</p><p>You could easily go into the Nadir package with the way extra deck is designed. I would just add an extra Garura to keep your Super Poly plays alive while being able to draw a card.</p><p>Still experimenting with some combination of Fenrir/Nib/Droll. Fenrir is definitlely the better card when going first; however, Nibiru is defenitely a better card to be drawn in case you lose the die roll. Nib can be used if the ritual spell is hard drawn and you have no access to Safira immediately since the spell does require a LIGHT attribute tribute(s). Fenrir going second is also a trigger for Promethian Princess so it can be sided out for either Duster/ Lightning Storm/ ECon depending on the matchup. I think TTT is too good to not be in the main this format and wanted it in any capacity. It gives you infomation on your oppenents hand if you do get drolled going first and is a draw 2 in case your Prosperity or Pre-Prep is Ashed. You could just cut it completely and play the 3rd copy of Pre-Prep to keep the deck at a clean 40.&nbsp;</p><p>Econ also triggers Diviner's effect to get access to Lo, since it tributes for cost even if Diviner is negated and dodges destruction. Lightning Storms can be swapped out for Cosmic Cyclones if you are seeing more Centurion and Floodgates. Anti-Spell checks a lot of the spell heavy decks right now and can just outright win you a game.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I learned of a cool tech involving droplet that can play around imperm which is cool, also ghastly glitch can dump the Evil-twins boss monster if you have one of the links on the field, or onibi. Running some Xyz to play around cards like D-barrier. Pank can help deal with established boards without getting in the way of the Ki-sikil and Lil-La cyberse monster's effects. E-con works really well when you tribute one of the links cause you can summon the tributed monster back and if you tributed Lil-la, you can pop a card in adittion to grabbing an oponent's monster.</p>"

Synchro zone is a cool tech pick and there is a combo you can do wtih gravity collapse as well, but it costs too much space in the deck and is unsearchable. I am running an extra deck that is pretty wrym heavy obviously, but there are some nice choices like adamancipator and barrone. PeP is also a neat choice, but strategist Longyuan burns so it isn't very nice, but it is a great option for busting out of near losses and its a guilty pleasure to play. Summit allows for a lot of extensions when drawn so it is increadibly good for recovering and pushing advantage though its not that nice to draw multiple of. Same reason we are running a Vessel, if you draw Taia you can dump a card for him to get a token plus some tenyi banishment extensions. Heavenly dragon circle allows for playing through interuption, same with droplet. Abyss dragon is good in this format if your opponent sets up a fire king island or the labrynth field spell. Though if your opponent isn't playing any of those then Iris allows you to play a bit during your opponents turn, plus I pulled a 25th of her so I am partial.</p><p>Extra deck is kinda weird, I mentioned the non-wryms that I am playing, I think they work very well in this deck, but I am only playing 1 Sinister because a lot of FZire decks play the charmer and thats killer if your opponent gets him. If they are playing fire, Chengying is a good because against sword soul you have a bit of graveyard interuption, kinda, but he is also a water that can't be stolen, plus 10 plus the level 1 adhara goes into PeP. The yangzing cards are good for extending your plays and helping you win over the board state going second, like in Baxia's case. I decided to run an abyss dweller because a lab deck may be running D-barrier, plus if you can't get to a synchro for whatever reason it can do a number interupting your opponents graveyard plays with fire king and snake-eyes.</p>"

I think instead of the Weighbridge, E-con, and Safe-zones I can try putting the Terror root cards in. I really like how those cards play and I think they are interesting, plus the new Afteroot card might make them more consistent to set up ( Wannabee! helps too). Shadow-Imprisoning mirror is also really good at dealing with specific decks like Chaos, Unchained, and Lab, and it doesn't affect your deck except for number 96, who I would replace with Zeus, Accescode, or the charmer. Since you aren't garunteed those match-ups, I play them in the side.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a different way of playing yugioh than what I normally run, but I like the Otter and the Melffys so I think this'll be a go to deck for me whenever I want to play a more casual game.</p>"
