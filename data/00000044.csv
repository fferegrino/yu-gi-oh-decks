Royal Magical Library + Numbers Eveil,"<p>Hello and welcome to another guide, where the aim is to FTK your opponent with Number 43. Rather than bot setup, this one can be considered as creative one. Let's get into action!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KDhI_KtWo0"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Play your spells to fill your GY while drawing your combo pieces. Then, XYZ Summon Dugares and pass it to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"".</p><p>2) Activate ""Soul Absorption"". Then, activate ""Numbers Eveil"" to bring forth Number 43 with other XYZ monsters you have.</p><p>3) Although not shown, Lizardraw could have been destroyed to draw a card, provided there is another Performapal monster on other Pendulum Zone. With two free spaces you have, you could set ""That Wacky Magic!"" and play ""Contract with the Void"" to fill your GY with more spells. Then, activate ""That Wacky Magic!"" afterwards to banish all of your spells to gain lots of LP.</p><p>4) The amount you gained should be far more than your opponent's LP, even if you have played 3 x Upstart Goblin. Simply pull the trigger with Number 43 and win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be either found within ""The Infinite Void"" or ""Life Force Control System"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Soul Absorption"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" + ""Numbers Eveil"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Performapal Monkeyboard"" can be found within ""The Bizarre Playing Board"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 240 SR and 60 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Focused on revamping ace monsters <strong>Judgment Dragon</strong> and <strong>Punishment Dragon</strong>, and using boss monster <strong>Enlightenment Dragon</strong> as often as I can (with its <strong>Synchro Minerva</strong> combo as well as the <strong>Cross-sheep</strong> combo as extender). Great disruption improvements compared to the old Lightsworns, especially with omni-negate <strong>Lightsworn Aegis</strong> (2 is enough; sometimes 1 is even okay already). Side Deck mainly consists of suggested cards that you can also put to use (I am not focused on tweaking to adapt or disrupt opponents in between duels for this one, these are suggestions for your build). I also preferred the <strong>Bystials </strong>over the Tearlaments support since I can aim for the Level 10 Synchros and the recycling capability of <strong>Branded Regained</strong> instead of the engine milling and free fusion provided by the Tearlaments. Also, I have loved Lightsworns ever since I discovered them in 2009, and I've been using them since. I almost quit Yu-Gi-Oh! when they released almost useless cards post-Twilightsworns. I am glad Punishment Dragon is viable now, and a purer Lightsworn deck in general. Peace!</p>"

The two archetypes have <em>Fairy Monsters</em> and your focus is in a monster with attack bigger and Special Summon's effect.

Kash Fenrir is used to search the Tear Kash. Most plays involve around just playing tear unless mannadium lines are available. Though some times the mills are inconsistent in this version.
