HOWWW?!,"https://youtu.be/gLJmc9sUSv8  TCG and OCG banlist legal (TCG C1000 when?). Yes, you can sneak in Number C1000: Numeronius in regular Raidraptor combo. Same starter like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/optimized-tsx1-yacine656-raidraptor/"">OPTIMIZED TSX1/YACINE656 RAIDRAPTOR</a>, but cant start from normal summoned Mimicry Lanius. So we run Summoner Monk as an extra copy of Tribute Lanius. If we dont draw those starters, we need to make <strong>Wise Strix + lv4 monster</strong> (roughly 3 cards, because Summoner Monk and Tribute Lanius are valued as 2 monsters). Combo is in the video below.  Cairngorgon is there to direct opponent's card effect (target and destroy) to Numeronius (super very unlikely to happen, but hey Yugioh players can't read). Light Dragon @Ignister and Fog Blade are there to prevent Numeronius boardwipe if its disadvantageous. The staples/extenders are preferably spell (for Summoner Monk) but there is no DARK Winged-Beast extender in a form of spell. <strong>Why not regular lv4 extenders?</strong> It's because we need 4 dark monsters in GY for the PK RUM (needs long combo, can't start with Force Strix) while still having Strangle Lanius target in GY (Strangle Lanius locks to DARK and Numeronius is LIGHT, it means we have to use our Force Strix smartly).  It seems convoluted at first try, you'll understand it clearer after several games.  <a><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/9VtzDTi.png"" alt=""image"" /></a>"

DEUS VULT,"Crusadia is an OTK strategy which main focus is breaking boards with going 2nd cards like Kaijus and lightning storms and then using equimax with stuff like maximus and/or leonis to win the game. The next lines are for those who don't have any clue how crusadia is played.  So crusadia is like I said an OTK strategy if you play it the normal way, there are also many combo varients like crusadia guardragons. Crusadia also synergizes pretty well with mekk-knights, because the mekk-knights can special summon them selfs to the zone the crusadia links points to and the big boss monster is a mekk-knight and a crusadia. However we're focusing on the OTK varient, I just wanted to show you that there are many ways to actually play this deck.  So let's get started.  Let us start with the main deck monsters. The main deck monsters all share their 1st effect and have an own 2nd effect. Their 1st effect says that you can special summon them from your hand into a zone a link monster points to. The 2nd effects are:  Crusadia Maximus: He doubles a crusadia links battle damage if it battles an opponents monster, but all other monsters you control can't attack the turn it used it's effect. This boi is the easiest way to OTK your opponent and conquer ähh I mean get back the holy land. And it's an easy 3 off, irrelvant which version of crusadia you're playing.  Crusadia Arboria: She protects a crusadia monster from battle or card destruction, by banishing herself from the field or gy. She is a nice protection if you're going 1st and doesn't want to lose your equimax or avramax or if you're going 2nd and couldn't OTK so your monster can survive the next turn.  Crusadia Leonis: He gives an crusadia link monster piercing damage. Yeah... that's it. This can win you games if you're playing against stuff like..., I don't know Ghostrick perhaps? Or people who think that it's a good idea to summon their monsters in defense against crusadia... Anyway It's ration depends on which version you're playing, since you're playing the OTK version you have to play 3.  The next 2 are a little different, their effects can only be used if they are mormal or special summoned into a zone a link monster points to.  Crusadia Reclusia: He can destroy 1 crusadia card you control and 1 card your opponent controls. He is basically the boi who sacrifices himself for the team by blowing himself and a card from the opponent up, he is okay btw... just trust me on this. He is great to lure out some interuptions from the oppoenent.  Crusadia Draco: He can recycle a crusadia card from your gy. This gives you a little grind game and you can recycle the crusadia you normal summoned back so you can special summon it to a zone a link points to. You should play 3 copys of this cute little dragon in any crusadia varient.  Now Let's go to the Spells:  Crusadia Power: It's basically a miscellaneousaurus as a quick Spell for 1 crusadia monster. It can be used either to dodge handtraps or to protect equimax/avramax. A good turn 1 play you can make if you bricked is avramax + power pass. The only cards this could out are either a normal summoned monter with 3000 atk. or a Kaiju. So yeah the power of god should be a 3 off.  Crusadia Testament: This card can either draw you 3-4 cards or prevent yoir opponent from responding to your crusadia effects which is pretty good. It's a 1 off tho, because you can search it and you only use the draw power if you cannot OTK.  Crusadia Revival: This is the field Spell which gives all crusadia links 500 ATK. and It lets 1 of your link monsters attack all monsters your opponent controls. So it basically makes your equimax/avramax to an ultimate conductor tyrano.  And now Traps... or should I say trap?  Crusadia Krawler: This is the only relevant crusadia trap. It special summons itself as an monster and can search a World legacy Spell if it's special summoned to a zone a link moinster points to. This is your 1st turn option which let's you search a World legacy succesion or a World legacy World crown. You could also search World legacy World lance to protect your equimax in battle.  And now the extra deck:  Crusadia Magius: He a link-1 which let's you search a Crusadia monster if a effect monster is special summoned to a zone it points to.  Crusadia Regulex: He is a link-2 which let's you search a crusadia spell or trap if a effect monster is special summoned to a zone it points to.  Crusadia Equimax: He is a link-3 who gains the atk points of the monsters it points to. He can also negate an effect by tributing a crusadia monster and targeting the card it wants to negate. This is our OTK machine which will help us taking back the holy land!  Mekk-knight Crusadia Avramax: He is a link-4 who is untargetable by your oppoenents card effects, your opponent can only target him for attacks. If avramax battles with a monster which was special summoned, it gains the attack points of the monster it battles. And if it's sent to the gy it can shuffle a card away. This card is a beast! Or atleast it was a beast when it came out. Nowadays there are many cards which doesn't target, like eldlich or zeus to name some, so the only way to let it really stay on the field is crusadia power.  So this were the archetype cards. Now I'm gonna show you some cards which aren't from the deck,but should be played.  Parrelel Xceed and Ranryu are some nice extenders for the deck. Xceed can special summon itself to a zone a link summoned link monster points to, so basically you link summon a link monster and on the summon of the link monster you can use the effect of xceed in your hand. It also has another effect that it can summon another copy of itself out of the deck. Ranryu can special summon itself if you control a spellcaster (magius or reclusia).  The last 3 cards I want to show you are: World Legacy Succesion, World Legacy World Crown and World Legacy World Lance.  World Legacy Succesion is basically a monster reborn. The only difference is that you have to special summon the monster to a zone a link points to.  World Legacy World Crown is a monster which special summons itself to a zone a link points to and it can negate effects from monsters specialed from the extra by tributing itself.  World Legacy World Lance is a monster which can be discarded if a link monster battles and if it's discarded your opponents monster loses 3000 Atk.  The last thing this deck has is the code breaker engine, but because it's not me who found it I thought I would give the person I have it from some support, so if you want to know how it works just watch this youtube video from Team COG:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTuSz_zn0kM  And now let us all take back the holy land!

This is post Ghosts from the Past (set is already out) and it is legal for the TCG at the moment so you can play this on DB rated and such. Dragunity got a lot of support via GHPA and I’ve seen a lot of lists on high rated DB which are actually viable. The deck is very strong, being able to make a million negates going 1st (includes extra deck lock, spell lock and the whole entire thing is nibiru proof) and can easily OTK going 2nd. And of course, since this is a Dragon theme deck, it has a ton of support/extenders, even some uncommonly played ones!! I know I said “Competitive” In the title and this deck is actually playable. If you make the right decisions, control your resources and know how to play this deck well (practice is key!), you can definitely take down some meta decks! I’m not saying the deck can top an LCS or anything but it has potential. Before I begin, I would like to thank everyone here at YGOPROdeck for the support in my last build with a detailed description (Atlantean Mermail)! I said in that build that if the post got 10+ likes I would do more like it and it ended up getting more than 10 (14 atm, might increase) so here I am! In this build I want to aim for 20+ likes, so if you want me to do more like this, make sure to give this post a thumbs up! Thanks again!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>If you want to see the combos, they are on my Youtube video, I also go over all the card choices and important plays there - I highly recommend you check it out for complete understanding on how to play the deck. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Link - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1JLHTN1Irw</a></span>  &nbsp;  <b>Main deck Cards -</b>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><span>3x </span>Dragunity Senatus<span> - This is your main starter, with any Dragunity discard you can equip Phalanx or Course directly from your deck (why would you even think of doing remus lol) which can then be used (one of the tuners + Senatus) to go into Gae Dearg (full combo basically).</span></b></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span> 2x </span>Dragunity Legatus<span> - This is an amazing extender which you can use to extend plays and this card can also be used to make Gae Dearg with a Remus and a discard, very important card but only 2 is needed. </span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Dux</b><span> - This is the last Dragunity Winged-Beast you are running, it’s great for recovery and can be used as a replacement for Senatus if you open Ravine + Phalanx (ravine searches dux). It’s just great and is only needed at 1 copy. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Dragunity Remus</b><span> - Oh yeah, we’re into the Dragons now!! Remus is a great starter (1.5 card Gae Dearg w/discard) and is also a great extender since it does not use your normal summon!! Counting Remus, you have 7 copies of Dragon Ravine in your deck. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Dragunity Phalanx </b><span>- This is a solid card, a very essential combo piece you want to see in hand, therefore I’m maximizing on it. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Dragunity Course</b><span> - This is just as good as Phalanx except you can’t synchro summon into crystal wing or savage using it and therefore I’m only running 2 copies. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Arma Mystletainn</b><span> - Essential combo piece, not exactly a brick if drawn because you can just use his effect and summon him out (he’s basically a Red MD for Dragunity), send him to the GY by some means and then use Dragunity Glow (used to search this dude in the combo) and even add him back from the Grave to use his effect again (soft once per turn).</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Arma Leyvaten </b><span>- Another essential combo piece, it’s also not a brick if drawn because you can just discard it and opening it will let you summon something else with Atum (it’s an xyz version of elpy) which you can take advantage of. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</b><span> - This is an awesome extender, it’s especially great because it can “monster reborn” a dragon from the grave, which is especially useful because all the Dragunity monster’s effects are soft once per turn effects!!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Odd-eyes Revolution Dragon</b><span> - This card is insane, it’s pendulum effect can be used to “monster reborn” any Dragunity synchro from the grave to trigger their effects again!! Just Imagine reviving a Gae Dearg off of this, the advantage you gain is insane! </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Amorphage Lechery</b><span> - Is usually on your endboard and can be searched off of Dearg, it makes your board droplet/dark ruler proof and it serves as an amazing floodgate. Not really a brick since drawing it allows you to search something else with Dearg.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Amorphage Goliath</b><span> - This is always supposed to be on your end board and it is a buster lock basically, you summon this guy off of elpy. This is a brick so keep that in mind.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Blackwing Zephros the Elite</b><span> - Oh my lord this card is insane, it can be searched off of Dearg and immediately discarded (basically milled off of dearg) and can also bounce ravine (or something else in other combos) back into the hand and summon itself back onto the field! Only reason you play 1 is because it’s effect is once per duel sadly :(</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Mist Valley Baby Roc</b><span> - It’s basically a free summon (off of Dearg) and is used in combos as well. You need 2 at least but you can play 3 as well. It’s effect is not once per turn. It’s also an extender if drawn because the deck discards a LOT. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Ash Blossom</b><span> - generic disruption/hand trap that is great against any matchup.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Lancea</b><span> - Another hand trap you are playing, it is really good against the current meta (counters literally all the decks) and therefore I’m running it at 3. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x</span><b> Dragon Ravine</b><span> - This can search any Dragunity, should be very self explanatory.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragunity Glow</b><span> - used in the combo, is not a brick if drawn (is actually an extender) and can be used to do some pretty crazy shenanigans. </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Terraforming</b><span> - To search ravine which can search Dragunity monsters.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x</span><b> Monster Reborn</b><span> - Amazing extender, it’s main purpose is to reborn Gae Dearg or a Dragunity synchro for gaining advantage since all the effects are a soft once per turn</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>3x </span><b>Triple Tactics talent</b><span> - this card is busted, it’s great for both going 1st and second and has 3 very useful effects. I like to consider this a part of the handtraps/removal section. </span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <b>Extra Deck -</b>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><b><span>1x</span> Gae Dearg<span> - This is the heart and soul of the deck, only needed at 1 because you basically just reborn him from the graveyard a million times for advantage :)</span></b></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Areadbhair - </b><span>this is the in-theme boss monster you usually have in your end board, don’t worry, it’s very easy to make w/Dragunity Arma Leyvaten!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Ascalon </b><span> - amazing card for breaking boards going 2nd. Keep in mind the banish effect is not once per turn and that it does not target or destroy. This dude can also be easily made w/Dragunity Arma Leyvaten!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>2x </span><b>Barcha </b><span>- god this card is busted! It can equip any number of Dragunity monsters from the GY onto itself making it literally (up to 4) extra summons!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Romulus </b><span> - Can search any Dragunity backrow (ravine or glow in our case) and is a very key combo piece!</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Seal</b><span> - literally all dragon decks play this for high impact interruption </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Darkness Metal, the Dragon of Darksteel</b><span> - This is good because it can reborn Gae dearg and it locks you but Dragunity does not even need to link summon anyways lol (you do the gaurdragon and romulus stuff before making this)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Triple Burst</b><span> - Used in the combo to help guardragon plays, it’s also a solid link monster.</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x</span><b> Elpy</b><span> - needed for the combo, can special any dragon from the deck</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Pisty </b><span>- also needed for combos, can special back Gae Dearg</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>1x </span><b>Dragon of Atum</b><span> - It’s another elpy!!

Amazon Prime Video today confirmed that it has ordered two more seasons of the acclaimed TV series ""Invincible"", created by Robert Kirkman (""The Walking Dead""). <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/theconjuring3/</a>  &nbsp;  After an almost unanimously acclaimed first season, there is after all a bad review of just over fifty on RottenTomatoes, so it was not super surprising that the bloody superhero series would have another season. <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/f92021/</a>  &nbsp; <div>Men vi tackar givetvis för att Amazon nu ger seriens skapare möjligheten att planera de två kommande säsongerna på bästa möjliga sätt. För den som inte har hunnit bekanta sig med ""Invincible"" ännu, så bygger handlingen på Kirkmans egna serietidningar med samma namn. <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/demonslayermugentrain/</a></div> <div></div> <div>I centrum står den 17-årige pojken Mark Grayson (Steven Yeun) som är son till vår planets starkaste superhjälte; Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons). Genom en hel drös oväntade vändningar får vi tittare se hur Mark blir superhjälten ""Invincible"" och börjar gå i sin pappas enorma fotsteg. <a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/wrath-of-man/</a></div> <div></div> <div>The feeling is a bit like a mix of thinking about Spider-Man being Superman's son - and it was Quentin Tarantino who got to use an endless layer of blood, well-written characters and incredibly detailed sci-fi (completely without limits) ...<a>http://rosenlundsakeri.se/community/profile/nomadland/</a></div> <div></div> <div>for to sew together the best possible story.

Don't play handtraps since I gave up on playing competitive and want to have fun but hand traps can be placed easily. AIQ would be first to go but I want to try to make it work since it seems quirky. You can also remove optimization and some a.i reborn/formud skipper... <strong>there is a lot of room for handtraps.</strong>  1st turn board: Arrival with danmari in grave, Firewall dragon darkfluid with three counters, and firewall dragon co-linked to both or a code talker link with cynet conflict set in backrow. Some combination of any othese really.  2nd turn: Destroy opponents field with wind pegasus and water leviathan then kill with firewall darkfluid or accesscode or something that is cool.

I've finally actually made this deck, and it's been a lot of fun. So in all truth and honesty, it doesn't play like Shaddoll Dogmatika, Invoked, or any of the other good Shaddoll builds, and I don't think is quite as good, but it's ridiculously fun to play. Anyway, getting right into it, I'm gonna re-explain the combos from a different Orcust deck I made. Then I'll go into the Shaddoll-incorporating ones (patience, ma dudes.)  &nbsp;  So first I'm going to explain the basic engines of this deck, so I can just refer to them later and save a lot of time--  First: PK engine (starting with The Phantom <a data-name=""Knights of Torn Scales"">Knights of Torn Scales </a>in hand. 1. Normal summon Torn Scales, discard a card to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> from deck to GY. 2. Use Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>. 3. Banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> from deck to hand; this triggers Torn Scales' effect in GY, special summoning itself from the GY. 4. Since you now control Torn Scales, you can special summon Silent Boots from hand. Now you have 3 creatures on field.  Second: Orcust engine (starting with <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> in hand) 1. Normal summon Girsu, sending <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from deck to GY 2. Activate Girsu's effect, creating a token to both your and your opponent's field. -(I'm going to stop the engine there, since there's a couple alternate routes you can go)  &nbsp;  Combos:  Orcust A: 1. Do the Orcust engine, banishing <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from GY to send <a data-name=""World Legacy - World Wand"">World Legacy - World Wand</a> from deck to GY, then banish World Wand to summon back Orcust Knightmare. 2.Use Knightmare, Girsu, and your token to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, activating his effect to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> from deck to GY and set <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> directly from your deck. Banish Ancient Cloak to add another Fog Blade and set it for two negates. :  Orcust B: 1. Do the Orcust engine, banishing Orcust Knightmare from GY to send <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> from deck to GY. Use Girsu and your token to Link Summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a>, shuffling your banished Knightmare into the deck and setting <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> to the field. 2. Banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY to revive <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a>, then use Galatea to XYZ summon Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star--on summon equip your banished Cymbal Skeleton to Ding. 3. Use Dingirsu and Girsu to Link Summon I:P Masquerena. On your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY to revive Dingirsu and send a card your opponent controls to the GY, then you can I:P into Unicorn and shuffle an additional card.  &nbsp;  PK  A:  1. Do the PK engine, using Almiraj and Torn Scales to Link Summon <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a>, then use I:P and <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a> to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>, activating Rusty's effect to send <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> to GY to set <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> directly from deck; banish Silent Boots to add another Fog Blade and set it. : (deja vu, anyone?)  PK B: 1. Do the PK engine, using Torn Scales and Silent Boots to link summon Cherubini, <a data-name=""Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"">Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss</a>. Activate Cherubini's effect, sending <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Reeshaddoll Wendi</a> from deck to GY; Wendi's effect triggers, special summoning a Shaddoll Monster face-down from your deck. 2. Use Cherubini and Almiraj to link summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, activating his effect to send Shaddoll Fusion from deck to GY and fusing him and your face-down Shaddoll Monster into <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. 3. Banish Silent Boots from the GY to add a Fog Blade from deck to hand, setting it.  PK C (starting with a fusion card in hand): 1. Normal summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>, discard a card to send Ancient Cloak from deck to GY. 2. Banish Ancient Cloak from GY, adding Silent Boots, then summoning him from hand. Use him and Torn Scales to link summon Cherubini. 3. Activate Cherubini's effect, sending <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Reeshaddoll Wendi</a> from deck to GY: she triggers, letting you summon a Shaddoll Monster from your deck face-down. 4. Banish Silent Boots from GY to add <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a> from deck to hand; Torn Scales triggers, summoning back himself. Set, then activate Shade. 5. Use Torn Scales and Cherubini to link summon <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"">The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche</a>; activate Rusty's effect, send a Torn Scales from deck to GY to set a Fog Blade directly from deck. 6. Activate the fusion card in hand, fusing Shade Brigandine and your face-down Shaddoll Monster into <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. --Note: If you have a dark monster in hand, you can add a Fog Blade off of Silent Boots, instead of Shade  PK Orcust (starting with <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> and <a data-name=""Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> in hand) 1. Normal summon Torn Scales, discarding Girsu to send Ancient Cloak from deck to GY. Use Torn Scales to link summon <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>. 2. Banish Ancient Cloak from GY to add Silent Boots from deck to hand; Torn Scales triggers, summoning itself from GY. Special summon Silent Boots from hand. 3. Use Torn Scales and Silent Boots to link summon Cherubini, activating his effect to  send <a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton</a> from deck to GY. 4. Banish Silent Boots from GY to add Shade Brigandine, setting him in the S/T zone under Almiraj. Banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY, special summoning Girsu from GY between Almiraj and the set Shade Brigandine; Girsu sends <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from deck to GY, as well as becoming a Tuner. 5. Banish Knightmare from GY, send <a data-name=""World Legacy - World Wand"">World Legacy - World Wand</a> from deck to GY; banish World Wand, summoning back Knightmare. 6. Use Knightmare and Almiraj to link summon <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a>, using her effect to shuffle World Wand into the deck to set <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a> to the field. 7. Use Galatea to XYZ summon Dingirsu, equipping banished Cymbal Skeleton. Use Dingirsu and Cherubini to link summon Rusty Bardiche, sending a PK monster from deck to GY and setting a <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>. 8. Activate <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>, using him and Girsu to synchro summon <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>; he equips Galatea from GY to himself. --On your opponent's turn, you can banish Cymbal Skeleton from GY to special summon Dingirsu into a zone Rusty Bardiche points to--Dingirsu sends a card your opponent controls to the GY, and Rusty destroys one.  That's it for the combos so far; if there are any cool ones you figure out, please leave a comment.  Anyway, moving onto some card explanations, first I'll be going over <a data-name=""Eldlich, the Golden Lord"">Eldlich, the Golden Lord</a>. I got inspiration for putting him in here from Joshua Friedman, who got 3-4th place in the recent Remote Duel Extravaganza. He's got a surprising amount of utility in this deck, as being a target for Shaddoll Fusion (to summon Construct.) Due to lack of time, that's all I have to say for Eld right now, but I encourage you to try him out. If you read my last Orcust deck, you remember Dark Hole? Well, I'm still playing it (albeit in the side deck) so FiGhT mE  &nbsp;  Overall, I feel like El Shaddoll Winda is a bit unrepresented in this deck explanation; with easy access to Cherubini and Anaconda, I've seen that you're almost always able to make her in a game.

We have a considerably broader focus and many different characters that are spread out in very different places.  <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/calyfilmpoland/comments/n2iuiw/obecność_3_na_rozkaz_diabła_2021_cały_film_filmy/</a>  - Over time, I'm pretty sure that ""Invincible"" will be able to take us on adventures and tell stories that would have required 20 Marvel movies in MCU, to even get close to the scale and variety we want to be able to offer in one and the same TV series. We will explore all corners of our world and all parts of what it means to be a superhero in it. So, what sets us apart is, above all, the ability to do all of this. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/calyfilmpoland/comments/n2jkit/kosmiczny_mecz_nowa_era_2021_cały_film_filmy_i/</a>  The new ""Children of the Corn"" follows ""a psychopathic 12-year-old girl in a small town who persuades all the other children for a bloody massacre of all corrupt adults"".

The strategy here is to xyz summon as much as possible and otk. The deck has a possibility of summoning 5 xyz in 1 turn. I've removed Ogopogo due to the fact that I find it slowing me down. I needed to switch it with handtraps.  <strong>Combos</strong>:  Going first: If you have BEWD and Alt BEWD summon Alt BEWD then summon Seyfert (if you have it) discard blue-eyes with Seyfert eff and add Galactic Spiral Dragon, summon Galactic Spiral Dragon and then summon Coach and use his eff in order to draw (thrice per turn) cannot enter BP if Coach eff was used until EP. Try summoning your other xyz like (Heavenly Dragon, Photonlord and/or Sky Prison make sure to read their effs). Finally end the combo with using Nebula and 1 other lvl 8 Dragon monster by using it's eff and summon Number 97 and use it's eff to summon Hope Harbringer by attaching Tachyon to it. The reason to end the combo with 97 is because you cannot special summon any more monsters here. If you're opponent doesn't use spells summon Hearth instead or whatever xyz you need. It's best to refrain from summoning Dingirsu, Full Armor, Galaxy Cipher or Cipher Blade on you first turn as they will be useful resources on your next turn (Unless you got nothing else to summon).  &nbsp;  Going second: Summon any of these (if you need) Dingirsu (Use his eff to send 1 card of your opponent to gy), Zeus (after BP use his eff *if* you need to get rid of cards) and/or Galaxy Cipher Dragon (read his eff) summon Full Armor or Cipher Blade on it (if you summon Full Armor use it's eff to pop 1 face-up card your opponent controls then summon Cipher Blade on top of it use it's eff to pop 1 card on the field. Finally if you see a chance to otk just attack with your big cards or summon Number 97 and summon Number 100 use it's eff and atk with it. Remember 97 eff doesn't allow you to special summon anymore monsters and you can only attack with the monster you summoned by Number 97's eff.  Depends on hand do whatever you have do this is just an example.  Update: New cards have been added and some changes."

They started out as a way to keep ""Chaos"" cards like ""<a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"">Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning</a>"" in check a those years ago, but while the game evolved into a direction where such counters where not really necessary anymore, the archetype is stuck in its ways with the newest support card rather supporting the ""Koa'ki Meiru"" variant called ""Rock Stun"". Nonetheless. I tried my best making something with this group of beatsticks and outdated mechanics, and here is the result.</p> <p>First, before I start listing my monster choices, there are three copies of ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"". Those are very much necessary, since the ""Koa'ki Meirus"" work with an upkeep cost system that either requires you to reveal a card with a certain monster type from your hand (unless you have one of the various exceptions) or discard one ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" to keep your monster from blowing itself up. You can there search for and use the ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"", use the ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" to give your monsters protection from the destruction effect or simply use them as Xyz or Link material before they implode.</p> <p>The monster choices are as follows: Three ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" are absolutely paramount, since they are both the only thing that comes close to swarming since they summon other ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monsters from the deck, as well as your best way to go into Link-2 and Rank 4 Xyz monsters; two ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak"">Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak</a>"" can inflict solid damage to the opposing life points and interact very well with ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>""; one ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Drago"">Koa'ki Meiru Drago</a>"" serves to counter Light- and Dark-based decks; two ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Crusader"">Koa'ki Meiru Crusader</a>"" as recovery tools, something to reveal for ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" during the End Phase, as searchable monsters via ""<a data-name=""Fire Formation - Tenki"">Fire Formation - Tenki</a>"" and as a passable beater; a small ""Rock Stun"" engine with two ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Overload"">Koa'ki Meiru Overload</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a>"", which give some Stun options as well as further summons and searches; and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Tornado"">Koa'ki Meiru Tornado</a>"", who I personally find very helpful against combo decks that like to end on large Special Summoned boards.</p> <p>I already mentioned a sizeable amount of the Spell cards, like ""<a data-name=""Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" (as cost for some card effects and to keep your monsters alive), ""<a data-name=""Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru"">Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru</a>"" (searcher and destruction protection), ""<a data-name=""Fire Formation - Tenki"">Fire Formation - Tenki</a>"" (another searcher) and ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>"" (ATK steroid), but there are some more. ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"" is helpful since it can clear the board of threats, which is something that does not come naturally to ""Koa'ki Meirus""; two ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" for card draw; one ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" primarily for reviving ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" but also to (re-)gain Link and/or Xyz materials; the copies of ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Airborne Assault"">Tri-Brigade Airborne Assault</a>"" allow the deck to search ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Tornado"">Koa'ki Meiru Tornado</a>"" by targeting ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Urnight"">Koa'ki Meiru Urnight</a>"" or ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Crusader"">Koa'ki Meiru Crusader</a>""; ""<a data-name=""Fire Formation - Tensu"">Fire Formation - Tensu</a>"" is help for further swarming; and the single ""Double or Nothing!"" is simply part of the ""Utopia Double"" engine. The Trap cards are basically meant to serve as floodgates and hurt the opponent more than they do you like ""<a data-name=""Lose 1 Turn"">Lose 1 Turn</a>"" to keep effect monsters at bay temporarily or ""<a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a>"" to do the same in a more permanent fashion. Both cards can also affect your own monsters, but due to ""Koa'ki Meiru"" monster starting out with high ATK and gaining a sizeable boost via ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>"", you can simply decide to go full caveman and simply attack with your beatsticks if necessary. The last card is ""<a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a>"", which can also hurt your board, but is oftentimes not that bad for you since most of your monsters are Earth Attribute.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features some Rank 4 Xyz monsters as the easiest option to go into: A sizeable ""Utopia"" engine featuring two ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia"">Number 39: Utopia</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Number 39: Utopia Double"">Number 39: Utopia Double</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>"" serve as solid beatsticks; ""<a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a>"" can search the ""Rock Stun"" monsters; ""<a data-name=""Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King"">Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King</a>"" is more effect negation and can be summoned via the deck's Beast-Warrior monsters; ""<a data-name=""Number 82: Heartlandraco"">Number 82: Heartlandraco</a>"" can make use of the ""Fire Formations"" staying on the field and can prove to be a solid direct attacker; ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" can get rid of monster you cannot destroy; ""<a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>"" recycles monsters for card draw; ""<a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>"" can shoot the opposing life points when the opponent is close to death and potentially provides another beater. The Rank 5 ""<a data-name=""Drill Driver Vespenato"">Drill Driver Vespenato</a>"" can make use of any Rank 4 monster you play and might prove helpful as a 2500 ATK beater with piercing damage. The Link options are simply the two destroy effect ""Knightmare"" monsters and ""<a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</a>"" is simply another utility tool.</p> <p>While there are some fun combinations like ""<a data-name=""Core Overclock"">Core Overclock</a>"" with ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak"">Koa'ki Meiru Bergzak</a>"" as a damage tool or simply blasting the opposing board with ""<a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Tornado"">Koa'ki Meiru Tornado</a>"", it has to be said that this deck is at the bottom end of the ladder. It is easy to counter, has little options to play through counters and/or negates and struggles setting up OTKs despite being a beatdown deck with high ATK values. Still, ""Koa'ki Meiru"" is an archetype in the game and therefore something that is worth looking at, if only for inspiration.

Instead I have opted for a small shaddoll engine to go with it, seeing as you can dump the fusions with claw, and the main deck cards with cannon. Claw is you main playmaker for the deck, you use it to combo off by dumping whatever extra deck card you want at the given moment, however this isn't good because you have to do so by battle. This deck is just worse dogmatika and that's why I love it.  Feedback is welcome as always."

Playing this build online is pretty fun and what I lack in brute force I make up for in my ability to make boards that will build themselves after they’re destroyed, instantly.  The deck I have here is the best form I’ve made yet for Despia but I haven’t gotten into handtraps yet because I’m still working on the archetype and the things I can do with it.  I did beat a zoolich deck with this build though (and in the process of that I had to survive two zeus in a row which I handed like a boss) so I feel it probably has a lot of potential and probably just needs a little love and work to be good.  What makes this deck good in the end though is that it’s extremely efficient with resources and card advantage."

Also good for special summon fodder. Pairs well with Lonefire for basically infinite tributes (almost).  <em>Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy: </em>Use her to get more plant monsters on the field. Very good for Link fodder and XYZ fodder. Also a good boss.  <em>Erika the Rikka Fairy: </em>Plant support discards itself upon attack against another Plant monster you control, adding 1000 ATK/DEF until end of turn. Pretty good with other Rikka cards that require tributes. Also pairs well with <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> to summon itself.  <em>Mudan the Rikka Fairy:</em> A searcher for Rikka spells and traps like Rikka Tranquility. Good for this deck in specific. Pairs well with Evil Thorn to summon it from your hand.  <em>Cyclamen the Rikka Fairy:</em> Basic special summon XYZ/Link fodder. Helps reduce level by 2 for XYZ.  <em>Primula the Rikka Fairy:</em> Basic special summon XYZ/Link fodder. Helps increase level by 2 for XYZ.  <em>Traptrix Genlisea:</em> Use to get out the traps first turn if possible. You want to go first with this deck. Pair with Dionaea late-game to get out more traps on the field.  <em>Traptrix Myrmeleo: </em>Used to get ""Hole"" Trap Cards in your hand pretty fast. Pairs with Dionaea. Run more Dionaea if you want to run more Traptrixes in your deck rather than Rikkas.  <em>Traptrix Dionaea:</em> Used to Special Summon monsters, specifically Traptrix ones, from your GY. Also helps get recovery traps from GY. Pair with Myrmeleo to clear traps and spells, or pair with Mantis to search for Myrmeleo and get traps to your hand.  <em>Traptrix Mantis: </em>Used to search Traptrix. Basic card, 2nd effect helps save traps with a Quick Effect. Also good for setting down traps you want to use later.  <em>Lonefire Blossom:</em> Pairs with basically every single monster. Good card.  <em>Evil Thorn:</em> Pairs with itself and Lonefire Blossom as tribute fodder. Good for links as well because it summons itself up to 2 extra times.  <em>One for One:</em> Searches for Rikka Petal.  <em>Bottomless Trap Hole/Deep Dark Trap Hole/Time Space Trap Hole/Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare/Void Trap Hole:</em> Will help you immensely in destroying some setup monsters and strong monsters. If you prefer Torrential Tribute (with Fury of Kairyu-Shin) or Grand Horn of Heaven, that is totally okay too because it works well with Rikka cards.  <em>Trap Trick: </em>A go-to setup for Hole cards.  <strong>Extra Deck:</strong>  <em>Teardrop the Rikka Queen: </em>Very good card to clear your enemy's field and make them cry.  <em>Kanzashi the Rikka Queen:</em> Protection for plants.  <em>Traptrix Allomerus: </em>Good for taking your opponent's monsters and also for Traptrix Support. Gets Traptrix cards from the GY onto the field.  <em>Silent Honor ARK: </em>Good for taking your opponent's monsters. Fun card. Works with Traptrix cards.  <em>Rikka Queen</em> <em>Strenna: </em>Works with Traptrix to summon a higher Rikka monster and gives it more materials. Very funny.  <em>Traptrix Rafflesia:</em> Works with Traptrix to get more Hole cards (essentially) by sending them to the GY. Makes them a Quick Effect.  <em>Saryuja Skull Dread: </em>Generally helpful with Special Summoning and such. Also (essentially) mulls your hand without having you discard. Good in general but not exactly the optimal play.  <em>Traptrix Sera: </em>Great Traptrix support, helps get out a ton of different Traptrix every time you activate a Normal Trap.  <strong>Side Board:</strong>  <em>Break-Off Trap Hole: </em>Link support. Helps that the Traptrix cards are unaffected, essentially making it a Raigeki.  <em>Floodgate Trap Hole: </em>Disables the enemy and cripples their monsters.  <em>Mirror</em> <em>Force:</em> The reason I have trust issues. A very good card. Could be a win condition.  <em>Rikka Sheet:</em> Takes control of their monsters. Good for Link fodder.  <em>Rikka Tranquility:</em> Summons 2 plants from your GY if done right. Have 1 on your field to make it work.  <em>Storming Mirror Force:</em> For when Mirror Force is no longer valid."

Due to the consistency cards the deck can play through some interruptions, but cant really do anything about Nib unless you go for Crystal Wing during your turn. This is unlikely to be possible due to Crimson's restriction."

Like damn, I think people should try them out. Especially with a Dogmatika engine they could be broken. Additionally the main core is pretty cheap and the card i have in the side counters Eldlich and Dogmatika pretty well. Solid deck. i built this one to be control focused and shit out beeg ships to shoot people down along with a huge trap line up. I included a Verte package to go into Rainbow Neos, not Dragoon, because i'm not a degenerate. Because this is so cheap I might just build it IRL."

I am saving up cash so i can blow my load to buy the Vision Hero engine IRL and build this, because i hav emost of it already. The deck sucks without either V-Heroes or Evil Heroes. That junk aside, it's a fun combo deck that can put out  huge boards of beaters that wipe out the opponent. I had a Hero build before so I redid it- a few things I changed out were things like Desires. Desires is way too bricky as it can banish important combo pieces like Mali a ton, so I cut it and found that i didn't have space for any more draw power. Fire Flint Lady is a good tech if you can find space for it as it helps with field swarming and combos."

TRISHULA BANISH FOR 3, LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO","ive been binging War of the Worthless and the Genex player made an amazing deck that can spam out Synchros really well, so I decided to try something like that. This build is designed to turbo out Synchros, using cards like Dai, Double Summon, and Overseer to help put more bodies on board than Genex are usually capable of doing so.  Additionally, I included a bit of Synchrons and Halq to help with this. The extra deck is just a fuck ton of Syncros to spam out and make. You can also play Fleur and/or Black Salvo if you want, it's a good tech. For some reasona  few of the Genex cards are expensive for no reason despite them being some of the worst???? it's fucking weird This deck is surprisingly strong and I love it. I reccomend trying it out, honestly. Also Genex has really cool lore lol"

Nearly every monster has a special summoning condition, meaning you can easily swarm a fuck ton of monsters onto the board and climb into huge Synchros. Additionally, due to the T.G's all having varied types and levels, you can play f o u r generic searchers, and that's just for the T.G's Fucking four. Overall, T.G's are surprisingly fucking insane, and can perform incredibly powerful Halq combos and beat people's shit in. also, the main core is incredibly cheap, under 30 dollars, which is really nice.

You are able to achieve that in many ways by having atleast 2 of your main cores, Servant of Endymion &amp; Magical Abductor, and Spell Cards for Spell Counters.  You can use alot of Draw Power for this deck, mainly by Spell Cards' and Magicians' Soul. Allure of Darkness is great, since most of the Main Deck monsters are DARK Attribute. The Spellbook Engine is also the best way for your combos, searching Spellbook of Secrets with Spellbook Magician of Prophecy and Normal Summoning the same in order to search for Spellbook of Knowledge for hand increase.  Instant Fusion is only Main Deck for Millennium-Eyes, by using him and other Spellcasters for Selene and being able to Special Summon Millennium-Eyes during your opponent's turn for a monster disruption.  Day-Breaker can destroy your Magician's Restage, being able to search for Magician's Right Hand.  Many other combos can be developed, try setting up your combo <div></div>"

Unchained benefits from Ecole de Zone destroying your monsters and replacing them with Mask Tokens, since they float into more monsters.  &nbsp;  So I made this go-first Unchained deck that focuses on controlling the board.
