My ratio's for a few different cards aren't 100% decided, but so far it's performing pretty nicely. A couple of the one-of spells are in there just as backups, depending on if I bricked. Called By still comes in handy sometimes. Foolish Burial Goods to send one of my eldlich spells, to get the banish effect. Memories of hope, to get a free draw 4 (assuming it goes through). Right now Lightning Storm is sided because I haven't decided whether I can make use of main decking it. But generally this deck likes to go second. It can go first, it just won't be as strong, depending on what you draw. If I go turn 2, I love sending Eldlich to grave to bump to the grave opponents boss monster that they ended on, or spell or trap. Then the board is still free for me to start the Numeron engine. I love rogue decks the most, even if they aren't the best, and having fun is most important to me, so try it out if you're interested."

<span><span><b>1. Introduction</b></span></span>

<span><span>Before I get started I’d like to take a sec to plug my discord server The Yu-Gi-Oh Writer’s Guild. We’re a community of Yu-Gi-Oh players and content creators who host regular events and offer feedback on your lists or guides. We have a Tag-Duel Tourney coming up soon as well as more events coming early next year. If any of this interests you I’ll leave a link to the server <a>here</a>. </span></span>

<span><span>It’s been a while since I released a guide as my larger projects are taking substantial time to complete and maintain. Due to this I decided to try a shorter format guide to share lists I’m working on or playing in events that don’t fit my normal <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-oct-17th-build-for-ycs-10/"">style of guide</a>. This guide format will focus more on the decks core lines and follow-up plays along with any observations I’ve made during testing or play. All that said we’ll begin this series with with my current ranked deck Zoodiac Eldlich. On its own Zoodiac has had a storied history of meta play leading to a ban on both Zoodiac Drident and Broadbull on the September 2017 banlist. Zoodiac Drident was released to one earlier this year and this along with the recent release of Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus Sky Thunder has propelled Zoodiac to Tier 1 again. Eldlich was likewise released earlier this year and in a similar arc to Zoodiac has featured in various decks between Tiers 1-3 since. The combination of the 2 has been spotted in top-cuts throughout 2020 although I was first exposed to it via Kyle Lemieux`s<a> top 16 list </a>from PPG Weekend #4. My list features the standard line-up of Zoodiac monsters and a somewhat conservative Eldlich package to make room for tech choice such as the Artifact Scythe package and Imperial order. </span></span>

<span><span><b>2. Combo Guide</b></span></span>

<span><span>A quick primer before I begin our look at the deck’s combos and follow-ups I’ve chosen these particular lines due to their frequency in my time with the deck. As with my other guides I’ll try to explain a variety of follow-up options for the hands however I always encourage ones own testing with any deck to fully understand the deck’s lines. </span></span>

<span><span><b>1) Any 1 Zoodiac Monster</b></span></span>

<span><span>The first line we’ll be looking at is the deck’s most basic line for going first or second as it only requires one card. We begin by normal summoning our Zoodiac monster, for the purpose of this I’ll use Thoroughblade as an example. From there you’ll want to resolve any productive on-summon effects before overlaying Thoroughblade for Zoodiac Hammerkong. Your next choice depends on if you’re on the play or draw: if you’re on the play you’ll overlay Hammerkong into Zoodiac Drident, whereas if you’re on the draw you’ll want to overlay into Zoodiac Boarbow. Drident will give you at least a pop going first, if not more depending on which Zoodiac monsters are attached to her and what else you opened. On the other hand Zoodiac Boarbow enables Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus – Sky Thunder going second as potentially an OTK that turn depending on what else you opened. Conveniently AA-Zeus is also a suitable follow-up if you overlay an additional couple Zoodiac XYZ’s monsters during the line. Both of these lines are independently powerful as well as an excellent compliment to other forms of interaction like Imperial Order or Artifact Sanctum. </span></span>

<span><span><b>2) </b> <b>Zoodiac Ratpier</b></span></span>

<span><span>Next up is the staple combo of 2020 Zoodiac decks: The Megaclops Combo. For those unaware Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops is an enormous link 3 requiring 3 XYZs monsters to summon, a trivial task for this list. While there are a number of lines that can end on Megaclops I’ve chosen to cover the most direct line. Starting from the summon of Zoodiac Ratpier we activate its effect to Foolish Zoodiac Ramram before overlaying into Zoodiac Hammerkong and Zoodiac Chakanine respectively. From there you’ll want to detach Hammerkong for Chakanine’s effect to summon Ramram from the graveyard before overlaying Chakanine into Zoodiac Drident. We then use Drident’s effect to destroy Ramram by detaching Chakanine before re-summoning Chakanine with Ramram’s graveyard effect. To finish the line all we have to do is overlay Zoodiac Drident into Zoodiac Tigermortar and use her effect (ideally by detaching Drident itself for extra set-up) to attach Ramram to Chakanine in order to fire her effect again to summon Hammerkong. Finally we’ll link all 3 XYZs into the titular Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops. On its own it represents a large and mostly immovable body however combined with any other interaction such as our Eldlich engine or Handtraps, Megaclops can spell a quick defeat for your opponent. </span></span>

<span><span><b>3) Cursed Eldland + Any Eldlich Spell/Trap + Zoodiac Ratpier</b></span></span>

<span><span>The final line we'll be covering today is a hybrid, based on average end boards of both halves of the deck. To start we first normal summon Zoodiac Ratpier before activating its effect to foolish Zoodiac Ramram. From there we'll overlay into Zoodiacs Hammerkong and Chakanine before activating Chakanine's effect by detaching Hammerkong to summon Hammerkong from the graveyard. It's at this point that the Eldlich portion of the deck comes into play with Cursed Eldland. Use it search Eldlich the Golden Lord before discarding your Eldlich Spell/Trap of choice to send Cursed Eldland to the graveyard. From there we trigger it's effect to Foolish another relevant Edlich card, in this case I'll use Haquero of the Golden Land as an example. Next we set our Eldlich Spell/Trap and pop it so activate Eldlich the Golden Lord's resurrection effect. From here we can close the Eldlich half of the line by activating the grave effects of both Eldlich Spell/Traps we Foolished during the preceding plays. Finally to finish we'll overlay Zoodiac Chakanine into Zoodiac Tigermortar. We then use her effect to attach Zoodiac Ramram to Hammerkong before overlaying Chakanine into Zoodiac Drident. All together this board will optimally leave you with 2 pops and pseudo-Towers in the form of Eldlich the Golden Lord and Zoodiac Hammerkong, plus any other applicable interaction one opens.</span></span>

<span><span><b>3. Final Thoughts</b></span></span>

<span><span>At the end of this guide I'd just like to thank everyone for reading this! Let me know what you think of the new format in the comments below or my server, link <a>here</a>.</span></span>

As the meta continues to evolve post the December 2020 Banlist one can expect a variety of changes to established strategies as well as a few newcomers in the form of decks like Draitron. However Zoodiac Eldlich seems to be evergreen in the current meta just as it has been all year. The deck’s power was raised somewhat with the addition of AA-Zeus but at its dual-archetype core the deck's lines are mostly unchanged from earlier builds. I've really enjoyed my time with the deck despite a lack of any meaningful competitive data due to its sheer versatility across a variety of openings. If I had to pick on one weakness of this build it would be its reliance on the normal summon sticking on the first turn in order to execute its powerful extradeck plays. One could perhaps remedy this with the addition of a card like Triple Tactics Talent although I don't think that will help versus more control oriented strategies. Overall Zoodiac Eldlich is a solid deck with some interesting interaction and several powerful pay-offs but is limited due to its reliance on the normal summon."

The idea of this deck is to draw as many cards as possible. The main idea is to get as many cards in the graveyard as possible and get to one of your Beginning of the End. This is accomplished first through overlaying for Coach King Giantrainer and Dugares. If this cannot be accomplished, there are backup options to getting to a Beginning of the End through Curious and Saryuja. There several end boards which can give you a successful board lock going first. You want some sort of combination of Apollousa, Dweller, Hope Harbinger, Vanity's Ruler, Dingirsu, and Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon (equipped with Dragon's Bind). If all else fails, slap down Bagooska.

Two Dingirsus allows you to several things. First, you can possibly play it turn one and turn two. Second, if you get into a grind game, it is nice to have a second Dingirsu send effect. Third, it allows you to go into Pain Gainer, which has an effect similar to raigeki. After you use Pain Gainer, you can go into Sevens Sins, the beefiest spider of them all. If you haven't used Dugares, you can use his other effect to double Seven Sins attack to 8000.

You can also play offense with Black Luster Soldier and Accesscode Talker."

Card explanations below...

<strong>MAIN DECK</strong>

Gizmek Kaku - This card is pretty underrated imo, as the extra zone is used in 95% of opponents decks and this card gives you a free special summon and equip (which bypasses cards that cannot be destroyed. Don't run more than 2 copies as if your opponent for some reason doesn't use the extra deck then it is basically a dead card (but again, who doesn't in 2o20 yugioh?)

Radian (Kaiju) - Dark Kaiju + staple hand trap to remove tricky targets (Dragoon etc.)

Hexe Trude - Special Summoned with Golden Castle of Stromberg, gives you a free pop and can be searched from deck (normal summon).

Ash Blossom - 3 Copies NECESSARY in today's meta

Necroface - The most important part of this deck, as for longer duels (more than 4-5 turns with this deck) it recycles your entire deck. Can make for easy otk with Forbidden Chalice if you have a lot of cards removed (or your opponent does)

Gren Maju - OTK that has no protection so SAVE until board is wiped and you are sure your opponent has no attack stoppers

Eater of Millions - Free 1 attack protection per turn, easy special summon, removes from play difficult monsters. Sometimes if you have 30+ cards removed this can also be a great beatstick if you don't need to immediately remove opponents monster from play

Gizmek Orochi - Pesky, free 8 card banish, monster destruction, quick effect summon. Easily three copies

Dimension Shifter - If you cross your fingers and are able to draw this first turn, it completely shuts down opponents graveyard. I'm not sure if i'd run this in every era with this deck, but with graveyard effects being SO prevalent in the meta, you'll want to run this bad boy.

Dimensional Fissure - One per deck, must have for banished decks

Harpie's Feather Duster - Staple

Raigeki - Staple (can also be combo'd with Forbidden Chalice to block negate)

Cosmic Cyclone - Staple

Allure of Darkness - Great draw power + rarely have to worry about not having dark monsters in this deck

Golden Castle of Stromberg - Perfect for this deck; it has battle protection, free 10 card banish, and allows you to search Hexe Trude from deck

Pot of Desires - Also perfect for this deck; staple

Macro Cosmos - Staple in banished decks

D.D. Dynamite - Was hesitant to run this for a while but it is REALLY helpful. 10 cards in opponents banished zone (pot of desires, dimensional shifter, necroface banish effect etc.) gives you 3000 free damage, and when your opponent manages to build a strong board but you just need a little extra damage to finish off the game, this is the way to go. Can also be combo'd with soul release but imo dimension shifter is better.

Evenly Matched - Staple

Dogmatika Punishment - Staple + Combo with Elder Entity N'tss for 2 pops

&nbsp;

<strong>SIDE DECK</strong>

Galaxy Eyes Cipher Dragon - Combo for blade dragon

Galaxy Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon - Good mp2 usage, can give you 3 pops and a special summon when destroyed to go BACK into another copy. Has helped me completely shut down opponent boards.

Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Can go into with either galaxy eyes dragon for easy board control

Starving Venom Fusion Dragon - Must have w/super poly

Elder Entity N'tss - Combo with Dogmatika Punishment for an extra pop

&nbsp;

<strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>

Nibiru - Staple

Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay - KILLER for link focused decks and also have built in negate. The only reason I don't run it in main deck is because if the opponent doesn't use link monsters, it's a dead card.

System Down - Cyber Dragon killer

Super Poly - Staple

Twin Twisters - Mystic Mine + Eldlich killer (staple)

Cosmic Cyclone - Staple

The secret village is a strong floodgate but not a must have and it would kill u to play twice so i only use one plus the terraforming."

Is it fun? No no no, we can't be having that.","Buster Blader is a decent normal summon engine that can make the fusion to lock your opponent out of the game with a VFD style effect when Buster Dragon is on the field, you can get both out easily with prologue. I decided to pair the deck with the non normal summon reliant Drytron which has proven itself to be one of the best decks of the new format.

The decks main goal is to normal summon buster whelp to search prologue and then use the drytron cards to combo off into herald plays, searching lancea, or just making the big fat boi draconids.

ruler is in there for the scenarios in which you don't find whelp and your just playing drytron.

The extra is just stuff to link off into on occasion and the buster package, along with nova and mechaba to respect Dogmatika.

(""NTR"" because Calamities cucks your opponent out of playing YGO!)","It took me a while, but I finally made a Calamities Turbo--I mean Virtual World--deck! Anyone who's read manga knows what NTR really means. As for why I called this deck ""Neo Tokyo Rave!"", it's because some of the Virtual World monsters have Japanese words in their name, such as ""hime"", ""roshi"", and ""kyubi."" Also, I know that this deck has a Diet Japanese theme, but I still do not forgive Ch*na for giving us the Coronavirus.

&nbsp;

*Sighs* Anyways, this deck uses a total of 9 hand traps, as well as 2 Lightning Storm and Harpie's Feather Duster. Despite this, the deck works beautifully going first, because it can easily end on a True King of All Calamities and a face-up Chuchi that can pop one of your opponent's cards. And if you don't have the necessary levels needed to summon Calamities--which for me personally was rare--Photon Strike Bounzer makes for an OK substitute.

A relatively new concept in TCG/CCG circles, a Boxing League involves taking a box of your choice and building a 40 card deck -- It's that simple to begin (and even simpler thanks to resources like the YGOPRO virtual pack opener!). The league aspect comes in after the first game, when you can then take a number of packs (usually 6) from another set and opening those to supplement your existing deck, so as you and your friends continue to play against each other, the decks evolve beyond just a set, sealed casual deck.

Big pulls from Galactic Overlord! A buttload of Hieratics, a good pool of XYZs including Neo-Eyes -- Generic big dragon beatdown! Nitwit Outwit works like a treat here too."

Thanks to the Pantheism of the Monarchs and the other draw cards( Pot of Duality, Macicians Souls, True Draco Heritage, Card of Demise) its extremly consistent in doing this.

The deck is immune to almost every handtrap or floodgates(even V.F.D. and Vanities Ruler) and very well in the grind game, what makes it a perfect Anti-Meta strategy. Obviously you want to go first, but thanks to the True Draco Spells and Traps or cards like The Monarch Stormforth the deck does pretty well in breaking bords going 2nd, too.

Enjoy!"

Use Chaos to summon Hamon in defense then use Opening of the Spirit Gates to bring back Chaos then link off Dark Beckoning and Chaos for Predaplant Verte Anaconda so that you can bring out Dragoon. Use Chaos' graveyard effect to get you Fallen Paradise, use Fallen Paradise to protect Hamon and to draw two more cards.

Hope Harbinger provides battle protection for Goliath while Azure Eyes tagged out from Spirit Dragon provides great effect protection. Timing is important for this as you want to tag out Spirit Dragon when Seals activates its special summon effect after it's been tributed, not when you uses it's bounce effect. Otherwise Goliath wont get protection.

Seyfert and Chaos Space are important as they get you your baby chaos dragons which are, more often than not, necessary. Your good extenders include Noctovision, White Rose and Draco as they're all free special summons. It's also very important to have the Stone of Legend specifically in the GY. Spiral Dragon and/or tempest usually come out at the end of your combo for your last rank 8 which should be Photon Lord most of the time."

(Also, a recommendation for an entertaining AND EDUCATIONAL YouTube channel in the description!)","

This is a Zoodiac Eldlich deck I build earlier today, inspired by Overly Sarcastic Productions, a pair of college-age YouTubers who make content focusing on fiction and history. One of their video series was on ""Journey to The West"", a 16th-century Diet Japanese (I refuse to call China by its real name; they know what they did) novel that focuses heavily on Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. Given how the Zoodiacs are based on the Diet Japanese Zodiac, and how the mythical El Dorado is located in South America below the Equator, ""Journey To The South"" is an appropriate name for the deck.

&nbsp;

For anyone who wants to watch the ""Journey To The West"" video series, feel free to click this link!  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61nuXrvqNgI&amp;list=PLDb22nlVXGgdg_NR_-GtTrMnbMVmtSSXa</a>

&nbsp;

If you want to check out Overly Sarcastic Productions' channel in general, click the link here! <a>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodbH5mUeF-m_BsNueRDjcw</a>

&nbsp;

While the deck does have a total of 9 hand traps (12 if the Side Deck is included), going first is ideal because of the numerous Traps in it. Due to how the Zoodiac Xyz monsters can be summoned, and Boarbow's ability to attack directly, going second can result in you summoning a 6-material AA-ZEUS without activating a single card. The side deck is full of ""go-second"" cards, in case you need to play a more aggressive version of Zoodiacs."

This is an updated version of my old build that I uploaded last week. The combo for the last build was a 3 card combo and was very conditional, but I have updated it into a 1.5 card combo! Dragon Link is not going anywhere anytime soon! It even ends on the same end board as the last combo! This new combo requires any of the starters and any of the extenders or Rokket Tracer in hand to achieve. I also made this build having 2 main goals - to minimize bricks and to make it consistent. This is my favorite deck of all time alongside thunder dragons (coincidentally also in this deck) and I have put a lot of effort into making the deck, combos, typing all this up and making my video so I really hope you enjoy it!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Full Combo = Starter + Extender or Rokket Tracer</b><span> </span>

<b>OR</b>

<b>Full combo = Romulus + Extender or Rokket Tracer</b>

&nbsp;

<b>Full combo results in</b><b> -</b>

&nbsp;

<b>Hand rip 1</b>

<b>Look at opponent’s extra deck and banish 1</b>

<b>Banish top card of opponent’s deck</b>

<b>Apollusa (2 negates)</b>

<b>True King of All Calamities (free win)</b>

&nbsp;

<span>It does not matter how you get to romulus, you just need to get to romulus, you can do it with all of the starters or you can even use 2 extenders or 1 extender and a normal summon to do so, it does not matter. If you can get to Romulus, you are good. There are many other ways to do the same combo, for example you can do starter + silverrokket or if you draw absorouter you can do it another way - the thing is if you can get romulus to the field and have 1 way to get another monster to the field, you have full combo. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>This is obviously post december 2020 banlist and since linkross, buster lock and smoke grenade got banned, this deck uses True King of all Calamities aka VFD as the main negate/win condition. This is a very consistent version of dragon link and you should be able to combo off very easily. To achieve this new combo I am utilizing the thunder dragons (dragondark and dragonroar). Dragonroar is not a brick it can be used with chaos space to achieve full combo (I show how to do this down below) but you NEVER want to see a dragondark in you hand EVER (No really drawing it is really bad).</span>

&nbsp;

<span>If you want to learn how to do this new 1.5 card dragon link combo, I recommend you watch my youtube video - In it I explain all my card choices and also show the combo. Please subscribe to the channel and like the video it is a great way to support me and the channel. Also be sure to answer the poll question down below! Today’s poll question is: Imagine you are entering a HUGE Yugioh tournament, what deck would you use?</span>

<b>Card choices</b><span>-</span>

&nbsp;
<table>

<tr>
<td><span>Starters</span></td>
<td><span>I am running 9 starters in this deck, 3 of all black metal dragon, chaos space (the best one) and Sefert. They are the cards that get your combo aka Romulus on your field and you will and want to see them in your hand all the time. If there is a case where you don’t see a starter in your hand, go into romulus using extenders! Getting any 2 dragons on the field = a starter and is a full combo! (with an extender or tracer)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Extenders</span></td>
<td><span>I am running a lot of extenders since you will require them for the combo as well as to play through handtraps. The obvious ones are noctovision dragon, quick launch, world legacy gaurdragon and monster reborn. The not so obvious ones are - if your starter was black metal dragon then chaos space, white dragon and black dragon are extenders; if your starter was sefert then darkness metal dragon and chaos space (can search emperor) serve as extenders and if your starter was chaos space, darkness metal dragon and black metal dragon serve as extenders. Rokket tracer can be a replacement extender for the combo and also serves as an extender because it allows you to use Dragon Ravine to mill absorouter dragon and add another rokket to the hand so you can use boot and special summon 2 rokkets, and you don’t need an extra extender or it can even mill galactic spiral dragon which you can use to XYZ into Number 38 which is an extra negate!</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Handtraps and Removal</span></td>
<td><span>I am running 3 ash blossom, 3 gamma and 3 Imperm for the handtraps. I chose these specifically for a variety of reasons. Ash is one of the best handtraps in the game and can counter just about everything. Gamma in my opinion is the best handtrap of this format because it can counter VDF, It can protect you from getting hit with an ash when you tribute sefert or when you activate chaos space, when you use quick launch and some other cases as well. It also serves as a way to turbo out savage as soon as striker dragon hits the grave so that your combo can be nibiru proof. I am also running imperm because it is a solid handtrap in general and also because it cannot be negated with stuff like called by the grave. For removal I am running 3 cosmic cyclone, it is a solid card and can wreck backrow and mystic mine players. It is also a great counter to Virtual World, one of the top tier meta decks of this format since it gets rid of the trap gate which results in no target for the virtual world monsters to special summon themselves.</span></td>

<span>There are only a few bricks in this deck. I count 3 real bricks. As I mentioned above, Thunder Dragondark is a brick, because you can’t do your combo if you draw it and it is a dead card in the hand. Another brick is PSY-frame Driver, but this is a brick I well worth playing because you need to to use gamma and gamma is the BEST handtrap in my opinion of this format. The last brick is Boot Sector Launch - it isn’t a dead card in hand or anything but you just don’t want to draw it because you are going to search it for free off of Striker dragon and nobody ashes a striker dragon (But there are always exceptions...). I have got this a lot saying absorouter dragon and galactic spiral dragon are bricks, here’s the thing - they are not, you can discard both of them from your hand and they are still useful and absorouter acts as an extra extender since it can special summon itself from the hand! Also drawing another rokket (not tracer) is also not that bad because you can summon itself and tracer from your hand for the combo, so you don’t need an extender! (That's why I said an extender or tracer because if you have tracer in hand you can mill absorouter using ravine add a rokket and then special summon both tracer and that rokket)</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Going up against current meta and side deck choices </b><span>-</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The best meta decks of the format right now are Dinos, Virtual World, Zoodiac-Zeus, Drytron and just VFD in general. I have included counter measures in the main and side decks to deal with these. For dinos I am running 3 lancea to completely destroy them (are very dependent on banishing) and I am running 3 cosmic cyclone in the main deck to get rid of the lost world. To deal with Virtual world I am running 3 cosmic cyclone in the main deck to get rid of the traps gate they need to target to combo off and I am also running 3 Ice dragon’s Prison in the side deck to deal with the monsters they normal summon as targets for the Virtual World monsters. To deal with Zeus I am running the Dinowrestler and the Kaijus in the side deck. Finally to counter VFD I am running the gamma package in the main deck and I am also running forbidden droplet in the side deck (Kaiju and the Dinowrestler don’t counter VFD since its effect can be activated during the standby phase). I am also running a Harpie’s Feather Duster in the side deck to counter basically any backrow decks including Zoodiac and Eldlich. Nibiru is also in the side deck to counter basically any deck! You can main deck it if you want but I chose not to. If you really want you can also side Mask Of Restrict to counter Drytron, another meta contender. I have not been seeing too much Drytron so I decided to not side deck Mask of Restrict. Ice Dragon’s Prison, nibiru and ash blossom do a pretty good job dealing with Drytron and I wasn’t seeing too much Drytron so I figured that Mask of Restrict was not needed. You can side deck it if you are playing against a lot of Drytron, it is really your choice. You can side Dimensional Barrier to counter Drytron as well. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Changes you can make to the deck </b><span>- </span>

&nbsp;

<span>There are some changes you can definitely make to this deck, you don't have to but here are some things you can do! </span>
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Include the dragoon package</b><span>- you are playing some extra bricks but you have extra deck space, you don’t need all the cards in there for the combo (you may want to play a 50 or 60 card deck if you want to include this)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Add in more thunder dragon cards and/or add in thunder dragon fusion and titan</b><span> - you can do this as well because in the combo after dragondark leaves the field you don’t search anything using its effect, you can utilize this opportunity to search something like Thunder dragon Fusion or Thunder Dragonhawk! (RIP Colossus we will remember you) I would go full 60 and add the dragoon package since verte can mill </span><span>red-eyes fusion </span><span>Thunder Dragon fusion and summon Titian and it can also mill red-eyes fusion and summon dragoon, it just works together better. You can even play 2 dragondark so drawing 1 won’t be the end of the world since you have another one in the main deck so you can do the combo</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Make it a 40 card deck</b><span> - you can cut the handtraps/removal cards and the extenders down to a lower size and make it a 40 card deck, I felt like for consistency I need to make it 50 but 40 cards are also great!</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Make it a 60 card deck!</b><span> (If this is one of your choices I like the way you are thinking!) - you should add in more extenders and removal cards if you are making it a 60 card deck, I would also put in the Dragoon package if I was going full 60 since there is a lower chance of drawing those bricks. If you are afraid to play the slow game you can also add a second boot sector launch and/or a second absorouter since you have space, in this case boot won’t be a brick since you are going to get another one via striker dragon to the hand anyway. </span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Main nibiru</b><span> - the only reason I did not main Nibiru was because I was playing against dinos and Virtual World a lot and they both counter Nibiru very easily. Dinos use Miscell and Virtual World can make Number 75 before doing the VFD combo, it is your personal choice to do this or not.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Side deck Ghost reaper and winter cherries</b><span> - this is mainly to counter VFD and you can put it in if you wish, it does a great job against decks like virtual world, it can also get rid of dragoon if you choose to run it and it is also budget. It is an amazing pick because VFD is everywhere. You can also get rid of halq using reaper. The good thing about using reaper is that you will look at the opponent’s extra deck with Trish so you know what is in it, so depending on that you can add reaper from the side deck to the main deck depending on what the opponent is playing. I thought this was not needed but some people are even side decking zeus as a reaper target, this is ok if you have space. </span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<b>Budget alternatives - </b>

&nbsp;

<span>Not everyone can afford to buy every single card in this deck so I decided to throw in some budget alternatives as well. Dragon link is definitely not a budget deck but if you want to save some money here are some tips. The 1st one is handtraps, imperm is $30-40 and is not cheap, you can switch it out for anything cheaper - effect veiler is an awesome replacement and does the exact same thing. If you cannot afford ash blossom which is $7-8 a copy (maximum gold) you can replace it for something like ghost ogre. The handtrap you 100% need to play is gamma which is $1-2 a copy and is reasonably cheap. Gamma as I mentioned is the best handtrap of the format and you have to run it. Another non budget card I am running is Chaos Emperor Dragon which is $30-35 a copy - you could run like an extra lavineer but it is not the same since emperor is a +1 and it returns itself back to the bottom of the deck. Halq is another non budget card I am running which is about $30 a copy, sadly you have to get this card for this deck to work, there are no replacements. Forbidden droplet in the side deck can be replaced by Dark ruler no more but droplet is much better because it is quick play and counter VFD, dark ruler does the same thing except it is not quick play sadly. This is a little unfortunate and is all the more reason to run gamma. You can also put in ghost reaper and winter cherries as an alternative to get rid of VFD. You can also run the dragoon package if you have money, Dragoon’s price has gone down from $50 when it was released to $30 right now- of course it is not in this deck and is optional to add. You may be wondering why I only included these in the list, that’s because everything else is fairly cheap! Some that you may think are expensive are really not, you just need to buy the correct reprint. Some examples - </span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Apollusa ($3 maximum gold)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Borrelsword ($3 maximum gold)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Borreload savage ($7-8 Tin of lost memories)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Unchained abomination ($1 tin of lost memories)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Nibiru ($7-8 maximum gold)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Striker dragon ($2-3 Tin of lost memories)</span></li>
</ol>
<span> </span>

<b>Alternatives/Ratio change</b><span>-</span>

&nbsp;

<span>By alternatives what I mean is cards that you can put in if you are going for a larger deck or if you simply don’t like something in my deck or if you want to change up the ratios</span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><b>Starters <span>some alternative starters are Chamber Dragonmaid and Parlor Dragonmaid paired with Dragonmaid Hospitality and Dragonmaid Tidying. You can normal summon chamber, search hospitality, link into striker, activate hospitality, bring back chamber and go into romulus (full combo with extender/any rokket) or you can normal parlor, mill tidying, link into striker, banish tidying to bring back parlor, and then link into romulus</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1"">Extenders <span>some other extenders include Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm (Great paired up with chaos space and dragon shrine/foolish burial), Tempest the Dragon Ruler of Storms(can also be banished off of trishula to search crusadia draco and milled with dragon shrine to get itself back), Crusaida Draco (tempest can search), the Dragunity Phalynx/Dragunity lance package, unexpected dai paired with flamevell guard and galaxy serpent (this makes it so you don’t have to play the 1 rokket synchron, halq can just summon serpent/guard), dragon shrine, foolish burial, one for one, more absorouter dragons and so many more </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level=""1"">Handtraps/Removal <span>You can play some alternatives for handtraps but please run gamma it is essential if you want to win. Some alternatives are nibiru, ghost ogre, veiler and even skull mister. For removal some alternatives are lightning storm, twin twisters and alpha the king of all beasts. You can also add knightmare Phoenix/knightmare unicorn replacing unchained abomination and/or heraldic seal - you don’t need those for the combos</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<b>Typical end board </b><span>- </span>

&nbsp;

<span>The typical end board should be VFD, Apollusa and a Number 38 and/or a Borreload Savage Dragon. But always, there are exceptions. If your board gets hit by a nibiru or something a typical endboard would be a Borreload Savage and/or number 38 at the very least and can also include something like a heraldic seal. The deck is good at comboing with less resources and is also good at setting up multiple negate boards including VDF which I also like to call a free win. When going second a well established board may include VFD, Apollusa and something to finish the opponent off like borrelsword dragon or unchained abomination. In general Dragon Link is a solid deck and can do a lot of amazing combos but everything comes down to practice and how well you know to play this deck! Practise makes perfect! But all I can say is the deck is not going anywhere anytime soon! </span>

&nbsp;

<b>How to combo if you draw Dragonroar (ss = Special Summon) </b><span>- </span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>activate chaos space, discard dragonroar, add white dragon </span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Banish dragon roar to ss white dragon</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Dragonroar effect, ss dragondark from deck</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Go into striker dragon and romulus doing the combo like usual</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<span>After this you just do the same combo as the one in the video, just pretend the dragondark isn’t there and you can banish whatever you want with trish, if you are going full 60 you can banish tempest and add crusadia draco to your hand! This will be an extra extender you can use to go into savage/number 38 if you have spiral.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Final tips </b><span>-</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Some tips/mistakes I see a lot of players make while playing this deck. Put your negates in defense mode  - it is very important to put your negates in defense mode when possible (links are an exception) mainly cards like VFD, number 38 and Borreload savage, putting them in attack mode is a risk and if your opponent lightning storms you, you must waste that savage negate/number 38 negate and in the case of VFD, if you need to stall out a little longer you can even use its effect on the opponent’s next turn but if you get hit with lightning storm because VFD was in attack,  well you can’t do that anymore. There was a point when my savage dragon had 4500 attack but still I put it in defense because the negate is what matters, you can kill your opponent on the following turn. Another common mistake is people not making savage/apollusa as soon as possible - nibiru still beats this deck and it is important to make these before you get hit hard. For example as soon as you have something like gamma/driver I like to make a savage as soon as striker dragon hits the graveyard. Keep those in mind while playing this deck!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion </b><b>- </b>

&nbsp;

<span>Again, if you want to learn how to do this new 1.5 card dragon link combo, I recommend you watch my youtube video - In it I explain all my card choices and it  shows the combo as well. Overall Dragon Link is still a solid deck and the Banlist changed very little of how good the deck is. It does change the combos and the endboard and all but it doesn't change how the deck is played overall. If you play this deck more and practise I am sure you will get better at playing this deck and you will start winning duels! Practise makes perfect. Let’s take Dragon Link to the next level! Hope you have fun playing and messing around with this deck! Let me know your thoughts about the poll question down below!</span>

<em><strong><span>What does the deck want to do?</span></strong></em>

The deck based on going 1st wants to set its own board of spells mainly, resist the opponent's turn, making 2 solid interruptions, so as to do otk in turn 3 with our restarts.

<p><strong>Important Archetype Cards:</strong></p>
<a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Madolche Salone&lt;/span&gt;""><span>Madolche Salone</span></a>: It must be played with 3 copies, beacause is the main engine of the deck, which allows us not to die from a single hand trap. Exemple like Magileine + Anjelly or Anjelly + Hootcake. Also allow us to resist much better to cards like Droll, Gamma or Ogre and to continue the combo with bad hands like: 2x Messangelato or 2x Hootcake.

<a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Madolche Cruffsant&lt;/span&gt;""><span>Madolche Cruffsant</span></a>: This card opens up a whole world to the deck, as well as being another starter, it works even better as an extender allowing us to have a +1 on the field. Thanks to this card we can do anti Droll/Lancea combo, and it also very important to fix or improve hands like Anjelly + Messangelato.

<p><strong>Staple to use:</strong></p>
<span><a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a></span>: Is simply the best floodgate to use in this deck, playing only earth attribute monsters doesn't hinder us in the least but gives problems to most of our opponents, also allowing us to play around cards like Nibiru. Is a card that can also be considered very well as going 2nd, and therefore played directly from main. In this meta I decided to play it only in the side deck, because so many decks now, have a way to take it out.

Flint Cragger

(Also, some criticism of this deck would be nice! It's my first Fossil deck, and I wanna make better","Fossil is an archetype I've been meaning to touch upon for a few months, but because I'm a lazy fool, it took me until almost Christmas 2020 to make a deck! For those of you who loved Nintendo's games, or have an autism-induced obsession with prehistoric life, this deck was named after the Fossil Fighters franchise. I actually got the first game when I was in my pre-teens, and I would play that crap for hours. HOURS spent digging up bones (and some fossilized droppings), cleaning them, and just slapping together teams of superpowered dinos. I also got Fossil Fighters: Champions, which was also a great game I got hooked on!

&nbsp;

Anyways, this Fossil deck also uses a small Adamancipator engine, and for good reason. One of Fossil's newest support cards was Flint Cragger, which lets you discard a card and send one of their Fusion monsters from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard. And because most of them have Graveyard effects that either add cards to your hand or pop your opponent's card, losing that card in your hand isn't a big deal. So Flint Cragger works amazingly with the ""Adamancipator"" Tuners, since they can summon Rock non-Tuners from your deck.

&nbsp;

Because Fossil is basically the Rock equivalent of Cyber Dragons, this deck has to go second every single time. With 9 hand traps, 2 Lightning Storm, and Harpie's Feather Duster, stopping your opponent from making any significant plays is top priority. Then on your turn, your goal is to try and get Fossil Fusion to your hand and OTK your opponent! And because Konami is too stupid to ban Halqifibrax, you can use Cross-Sheep to link climb into it, then use Halq's effect to go into Selene, and finally Accesscode Talker.

&nbsp;

But if you need to go first, there is some hope for you. Due to Halq and Cross-Sheep making great extenders, you can use them going first to put two Link 2s on board, and use them to make Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. But because the Extra Deck is so tight, I couldn't put Masquerena in there. Ugh..."

This deck is really fun and can control the board easily. It even can OTK. I'd recommend some handtraps if possible but it works great without them.
Malicious Bane is basically the Dragoon of this deck. He's a pain to deal with. Him and DarkLaw make a good combo to lock your opponent.
Really fun to play with.

This seems to do the job. Best combo is using any Danger! and using Grapha to summon out Dragulbion to summon Numeron Dragon.

The other Cyber Angel monsters have synergy with Benten whether it be using their effects by interacting with Cyber Angels in the graveyard or with Benten being able to search any Cyber Angel from the deck after being tributed, which is super easy with Drytrons. The main strategy is getting either Vrash, Izana or Dakini onto the field to cause some serious damage and if all else fails use the Extra Deck to summon strong monsters like Soldier of Chaos, Accesscode Talker, or Divine Arsenal AA Zeus.

This deck was built off of this decklist before I made some adjustments to it: https://ygoprodeck.com/drytrons-toolbox/

Hypothetically you don't absolutely need the full Dragoon package since King of the Swamp can fill in for Dark Magician and you are running 10 effect Dragons it's actually possible to summon Dragoon with regular Poly fairly frequently however Verte combo is obviously more consistent.

Go into Spirit Dragon -&gt; Spark Dragon -&gt; Cloudcastle for True King of All Calamities plays.

","So, here's another deck that doesn't need (or want) the Eldlich engine, but i'm mashing the Eldlich engine into it anyway, because my parents didn't love me enough as a child. This is basically Eldlich beatdown with Sacred Beast beatdown, so they hit really hard and either A) End the game in one turn, or B) Die to mirror force. So basically just the egyptian gods but actually good cards lol. Wish the Wicked Gods got more support tho
<span>Deck guide</span>

2x Hamon- SODO NO CHI SADAMEEEEEE- Me being a dumbass aside, here we have Hamon, one of the two Sacred Beasts we're running (Uria was excluded due to a lack of traps). Hamon isn't too hard to get out due to Cerulean Skyfire, Opening, Eldland, etc. Cerulean Skyfire makes it easier to get out by using facedown spells, so you can use useless shit like Black Awakening for it. Hamon, on field, is a fairly solid beater in attack position that can do an extra 1000 burn damage whenever it attacks, which helps with an OTK. In defense, only he can be targeted for an attack, which is fine for walling up. Skyfire regularly changes it's position for negations, so it's not too hard to get both position effects off.
2x Raviel- Raviel was originally fairly hard to get out, but now it's actually pretty easy to get out. You can cheat out Raviel with Beast, getting it out onto the field much easier than how it'd normally be. Raviel requires 3 fiends to get out, so if you don't cheat it out, you can shit out a good amount of Fiends with stuff like Chupacabra and Dark Beckoning Beast. While Raviel is on the field, when the opponent normal summons, he gets a token. Said Token can be tributed for Raviel to gain the attack of the token (1000) as long as it lives through the opponent's turn. Raviel's secondary effect is that he can tribute other monsters to gain their attack, so you can tribute smaller and more useless monsters to copy  their attack for an OTK.
2x Shimmering Scraper- Shimmering Scraper is a great card for more Raviel focused builds, which this is in some part. Shimmering Scraper can actually be summoned onto by tributing any 3 monsters to special summon him, making him just a 4k beater for whenever you need him, but that's not the intended usage. The intended usage is to discard it and target Raviel to double it's attack, which combined with Raviel's attack gaining effect, can go to 8000 plus. And in the grave, he can tribute a monster to bounce himself back to the hand, being easily recycable.
3x Dark Beckoning Beast- Dark Beckoning Beast searches out all the Sacred Beasts or one of the cards that specifically mention it (which there are a lot of) to fill in the gaps in your hand and supply whichever Sacred Beast you need at the time. It also gives you an extra normal summon off a fiend with 0 attack/defense (AKA chaos summoning beast), making him a great extender for a lot of plays.
3x Chaos Summoning Beast- Chaos Summoning Beasts helps get out all the Sacred Beasts you need, as the deck searches heavily, meaning you can get both Hamon and Raviel to hand. You can cheat out the one you struggle to get out legitametly (most likely Raviel) and then send continous spells to summon Hamon, making a strong board of beaters that you can rank into Gustav later.
2x Eldlich- Eldlich fucking beatdown. This is a mistake of an idea, but later. Like i've said before, you want to quickly get out Eldlich as fast as possible by using his effect on things like Cursed Eldland for it's search. Eldlich, on field, is a 25k beater (yes I said it) to contribute to the OTK, and the other cards that stun the opponent center around Eldlich.
3x Chupacabra- Chupacabra provides Fiend field presence, allowing you to get a good amount of Field's onto the board so you can get Raviel out how it's supposed to and cheat out the Joseph Joestar Headass. It's discard can be pretty risky, but as long as you get lucky you can dump some stuff you'd want in the grave into the grave (like the Golden Land stuff) for their effects, and get the draw. Although, Chupacabra's discard effect is useless, so.
3x Cerulean Skyfire- Cerulean has a host of solid effects for the deck, and Hamon.  It's first effect allows you to use face down spells (regardless of type) for Hamon's summon, which is great for using dead cards like Eldlixer. It's second effect allows you to negate any spell/trap the opponent activates and change your Hamon to defense, and this is amazing for being treated as a passive effect, meaning it can actually negate spell speed 4 stuff like super poly. And whenever one of the Beasts leaves the field, you take no damage for the rest of the turnt hey left, preventing you getting OTKed yourself.
3x Spirit Gates- Spirit Gates searches out all of the Sacred Beasts, or any of the smaller support monsters, giving you literally anything you need for your Sacred Beast plays. Additionally, Spirit Gates allows you to discard a card to special a Fiend with 0 attack/defense from grave, which is fantastic. Personally, I like getting a field of 3 fiends (Chaos, Beckoning, and Chupacabra most likely), and then sending them all off for Raviel.  Then you activate Spirit Gates to bring Chaos back and use it's effect to bring back Chaos, tributing Chaos to special out Hamon and have a huge board of Sacred Beasts. And, if you  control a Level 10 monster, you can bounce back a continuas spell from grave to hand, allowing you to recycle all the cards you sent away for Hamon.
3x Fallen Paradise- Fallen Paradise gives great protection to all of the Sacred Beasts, so you won't put resources into them and then have them be immediately destroyed. Fallen Paradise also gives you an amazing draw 2 as long as you control 1 of the sacred beasts, allowing you to extend your plays.
3x Cursed Eldland- Cursed Eldland, at  a miniscule life point cost, searches out Eldlich and the golden land traps, filling in the gaps of your hand. You mainly want to search Eldlich, and then summon Eldlich by sending Cursed Eldland for Cursed Eldland's effect. When Cursed Eldland leaves the field, it sends an Eldlich monster or a Golden Land card from your deck to the grave, allowing you a ton of good graveyard set up for more plays.
1x Eldlixer- Eldlixer helps with swarming the field with multiple Eldliches, for Eldlich Beatdown or to overlay into a Gustav. Additionally, you can banish Eldlixer from the grave to set a Golden Land trap directly from deck to S/T. The second effect is the one you want most, which is why you mainly want to send Eldlixer off of Cursed Eldland or something in that vein.
3x Awakening- Awakening is basically a one-sided Skill Drain, and is an amazing card. As long as you control 1 Sacrd Beast, you gain LP whenever your opponent summons, equal to the attack of the summoned monster. This effect isn't very major, as gaining life points sucks. 2 is where it gets great; As long as you control 2 Sacred Beasts, which you want to, you negate the effects of all face up monsters the opponent controls. This cripples most modern strategies and is a one-sided Skill Drain, being an amazing effect. I won't even mention the 3 effect, because it's impossible to get.
3x Scarlet Sanguine- Scarlet Sanguine also allows you to get out Eldlich, helping a fair amount with swarming with the Golden Boys. Sanguine also helps you easily get out tons more of the Golden Land traps, as you can banish it from the grave to set one directly from deck. While you can only activate one of these effects per turn, making it a bit slow, it's still a solid card.
2x Conquistador- Conquistador helps a lot with removing problem cards, as it gives non-targeting removal, which is very powerful in the modern game. Conquistador helps a lot with clearing boards to pave the way for an OTK, and is also just a body on field for a Knightmare or something.  He can also be banished to set Eldlixer traps directly from deck, which is great. And, like Sanguine, only one effect can be activated per turn.
2x Golden Land Forever!- Forever is a great source of negates and such, as this deck lacks many negates outside of Skyfire. It can negate literally anything by tributing an Eldlich, which is a great effect for making sure the opponent can't launch a comeback and you can finish them off, if you didn't end the game in turn 1.
<span>The extra deck</span>

3x Gustav Max- Gustav Max is a great rank 10 XYZ, as it allows you to finish off games with ease. You can go into it easily with stuff like Eldlich, since they swarm the field so much, and any of the Sacred Beasts you don't need. Once you get your opponent to a low LP total, you can use Gustav to finish them off, or to bring them to the brink of death. It's also a generally solid 3k beater.
3x Almiraj- Almiraj is mainly just Extra deck filler, although you can go into it sometimes if you bricked or something.
3x Borrelsword- Borrelsword is generally a great beater, and fits a lot into the OTK play style. If you have any left over monsters, you  can go into a Borrelsword to clear the opponent's field and do huge amounts of damage.
3x Pheonix- Pheonix allows you to clear problem backrow with any left over monsters, in case your opponent has something annoying up that you need to get rid of.
3x Unicorn- Unicorn is great for non-destruction removal, which is great in the modern game. It can clear the opponent's field and make it easy for an OTK.
<span>Playing Guide</span>

This deck is mainly a going second beatdown deck, which aims to close the game off in the first turn but has the Golden Land traps and such as insurance in case it doesn't. You want to lead off with activating Opening if you have it, to search and such, and also activating Fallen Paradise if you have it. Afterwards, you'll want to summon out Dark Beckoning alongside Chaos Beckoning. If you have a backrow that can manage 3 or more Continuous Spells, you'll want to tribute Chaos for Raviel, so you can get out Raviel easily and then get out Hamon legitametly. If you have Chupacabra in hand, you can summon it and get out 3 Fiends, to tribute for Raviel. Then you recycle Chaos with Opening, so you can get out Hamon illegitametly. Then, you'll have a field of both Sacred Beasts without much trouble. For the Eldlich, like normal, you'll want to activate Cursed Eldland to get Eldlich. Then, with Eldlich, you'll summon it by sending Eldland and then build up your backrow of strong Golden Land traps. From there, you want to mercillesly beat the shit out of the opponent. If they're not dead in turn 1, you want to stun them with the Golden Land traps so they can't do anything, and then finish them off in turn 2.
Any suggestions or advice is appreciated. Thank you!"
