You'll likely be siding these out between games. <h2>Extra Deck</h2> <strong><a data-name=""GranSolfachord Musecia"">GranSolfachord Musecia</a></strong> ⦁ The Link-2 you will want to make before you Pendulum Summon. She targets a Pendulum Summoned ""Solfachord A"" so you can <span>search for ""Solfachord B""</span>, whose Level = Scale of ""Solfachord A"". ⦁ Cutia = Coolia, vice versa. ⦁ Dreamia = Beautia, vice versa. ⦁ Eliteia = Angelia, vice versa. ⦁ Fancia = Gracia, vice versa. ⦁ You can swap Pendulum Monsters between Hand &lt;-&gt; Extra Deck, too, I guess. ODD for EVEN, vice versa.

The cyberdragon engine acts as removal or just try to hit with as much damage as possible. The cyberdark engine will generally add a body to the board that can do some damage or can be used as link fauder. Generally the cyberdark engine will be someway to get to the continuous spell cyberdark world. This will usually be done by cyberdark claw's discard effect and cyberdark claw can be added by cannon. The continuous spell will usually add a cyberdark and can also act as a double summon so that the cyberdark engine does not need your given normal summon. This generally allows you to make sieger with some other bodies or some other combination that can let you go for game.

Here comes Dogmatika Invoked. You have 6 1 card 1-2 interruption cards in each archetype. Aleister or Meltdown both make Mechaba, and the Dogmatika engine follows up to help guarantee Dogmatika Punishment, which 2 for 1s or pops one and sets up a follow-up. You run Set Rotation and Secret Village of the Spellcasters and Terraforming, to help you set up Spell negates with Mechaba low end, and lock your opponent out of spells. This is because you run relatively a lot of backrow. After that, it is all cards that trade 1 for 1, and Pot of Prosperity to put it all together.  Starting line-up is 3 Ash, 3 Imperm, 3 Veiler. Hand traps are good, and good hand traps are great. Let's be live folks! Since there's space, 3 Book of Moon, not as good a ""neg 1"" as Imperm, but quite a flexible and powerful interruption in its own right. Called By the Grave is good, both engines are vulnerable to Ash, but limited. Still worth running for when you do see it. Another good quick-play for interruption. After that, we might as well respect the trap decks, so Cosmic Cyclone makes sense.  Side deck is cards for going first, and cards for going second, splashing a little to respect the trap decks. In this deck Forbidden Droplet is just better than DRNM, but we want to play when we go second against combo decks, don't we?  Shaddoll engine meant running a brick to very rarely summon a Winda. Nah. Miss LinkFibre combo era for being able to cheese her out in combo decks, but now you either play the Shaddoll enine as you main thing or you don't IMO.  &nbsp;"

It's pretty good from what I've tested, but definitely needs some work. ","The deck is pretty versatile overall, with quite a few combos to string together. The main goal is to get a pendulum scale that can summon level 7 monsters to get your Odd-Eyes Dragons or Dragoncallers on the field. My favorites are the Oafdragon and Dragonpit Magicians for the pendulum cards due to their powerful effects. With Oafdragon, any face-up pendulum monsters in your extra deck can be returned to your hand once per turn. This allows you to summon that monster even if you already have one in your extra monster space. With Dragonpit, he can destroy one spell/trap card on the field if you discard one monster from your hand; which you can acquire if you use Oafdragons effect, if you have none in your hand. This effect can also be used on your own spell/trap cards, which can be useful if you want to replace the other pendulum card you have out with a better one from your hand.  If you don't have the pendulum cards you want in your hand, there are many option to get them from your deck. Pendulum Call is the obvious spell to get two ""Magician"" pendulum monster in your hand, but <strong>make sure they are the ones you need.</strong> I say this because its side effect is that you can't use, or already have used, pendulum zone effects during the turn it's played. This means if you grab a Wisdom-Eye for an extra level 4 monster and you want to use his effect to replace him in his pendulum zone, you'll have to wait until your next turn to use it. The best way to get magicians in your hand is Star Pendulumgraph. Not only does this make your spellcasters immune to spells or monster effects, but if a ""Magician"" card leaves your field for <strong>ANY </strong>reason you can add another ""Magician"" card from your deck to your hand. This synergizes SUPER well with Sky Iris, since you can destroy a ""Magician"" card on your field and get both an Odd-Eyes AND another Magician card in your hand in one go.  Now to move onto the powerhouses of the deck. An unexpected clutch card you're gonna want in your hand ASAP is Poison Magician. When it leaves the field, you can destroy 1 face-up card on the field. Using Sky Iris or Dragonpit is ideal to activate this effect, but if you don't have those options and have LP to spare you can just attack your opponent's stronger monster to remove the threat with Poison's ability. A lot of high attack power monsters lack a effect canceling abilities, so if you can't get a strong enough Odd-Eyes or Rebellion Dragon on the field, this guy can save your bacon and disrupt an opponents strategy. A staple heavy hitter in this deck is Absolute with 2 Odd-Eyes as materials. Its effect lets you cancel an attack once per turn, including your own, by removing a material, and if you do you can special summon an Odd-Eyes from your hand or GY. Ironically, if you remove an Odd-Eyes and it's in the GY, you can choose that very Odd-Eyes to be revived. If it's still your battle phase, that special summoned Odd-Eyes can attack as well. This plays into the main strategy of this deck: flood your field with various Odd-Eyes so you can wipe out your opponents monsters and LP.  There are more strategies in this deck that I could go into, but these are the main ones I use during duels, so I'll leave it here for now. Let me know what you think and tell me if there's anything I should change about it!  (PS: The side deck is empty because I've used this deck for single duels only and I don't know what should go in a side deck. If you have a suggestion, post it in the comments and I'll check it out and add it in!)"

Here we are counting on Deskbots -&gt; Halq -&gt; Auroradon combo to get us the necessary materials to pop off with Magikey.  Keep in mind, as with all decks that rely on Auroradon, this can make a really powerful end board, but you are especially vulnerable to hand traps, such as Ash, Imperm, and Nibiru. I have tried to make this a little bit more resilient by adding in a Machina package. Machina Fortress is a machine that can special summon itself, meaning that even if they Ash or Veiler your Halq, you can still link into Auroradon. In the worst case scenario, then you can leave Fortress on the field with a Citadel in grave, and hope to stun and disrupt your opponent enough to try the combo again next turn."

If you have 3 Dark ""Magician"" and 2 ""Red-Eyes B. Dragon"" or something like that in the first turn, you must learn to believe “The Heart of Cards”. - The Extra Deck is powerful (I’m sure) if you can Summon them. - I use 3 Ghost Reaper in Side Deck because you can put it in ur Main Deck to banish “Red-Eyes Dark Dragon” if your opponent used it. --- Enjoy the game! ---</div></blockquote>"

If you're a snake, that is.</span>  <span>Not only are we in the peak of snake season, roughly lasting from early April to late November, it is also past the release of their amphibian friends. And what's a party without friends. (&gt;^^)&gt; 'Cause ain't no party like a friendship party 'cause a friendship party never stops! &lt;(^^&lt;) But before we take a closer look at the deck, let's take a look at our snake's best friend...or in our case, new overlords.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Alien Stealthbuster"">Alien Stealthbuster</a><span>: This Wolverine from another planet can banish itself from the GY to target and destroy any card that has A-Counters on it. Sadly, you cannot use this effect the turn it is sent to the GY. But that's not what we're looking for anyways. Instead, this card places 2 A-Counters on a face-up on the field. This is a trigger effect and harmonizes well with Alien's other newcomer.</span></span></li>  	<li> <div id=""preview"" class=""cardfront unselectable""> <div class=""cardfront_content""><span class=""name_txt selectable""><span><a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a></span>: Okay before I talk about this card. Why Konami, why is this card called ""Slicer""? This nightmarish Mr. Krabs has claws...ALSO CALLED PINCERS! It is also not an Alien by name but I think the design speaks for itself here. Now with the namesake out of the way let's answer the scientific question of ""what this do?"" Ever heard of Mystic Mine? Don't worry, it's not that bad. Your opponent's monsters with an A-Counter are switched to Defense Position and cannot activate their effects. Kind of like Bagooska but better. So it's a walking - or crawling, I can't really tell - floodgate. On Link Summon this card also searched any card that has an effect that places A-Counters. The wording on this card is luckily very broad, allowing you to search a myriad of cards.

But this deck is trying to be competitively viable. The reason you don't see a deck that can draw 11 cards on turn 1 top is because, frankly, it's not that consistent. Any handtrap can stop you and then there's not too much else for you to go into. Besides that you go through all your Ogdoadic cards during your combo and keeping them live in your GY for the following turn, so drawing 8 more of them isn't really all that is seems to be. And even if you end up with your combo, you may have a lock on the board but no negates or protection to keep it live.  Instead, this deck is trying to consistently as possible not only establish the lock, but also set up a Dingirsu or Hope Harbinger to protect your Slicer from card effects. At the same time it aims to make sure you can always access an alternative endboard.  &nbsp;  <span>The Slicer Lock:</span>  Usually you want to end on <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a></span> plus either <span><a data-name=""Alien Kid"">Alien Kid</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""&quot;A&quot; Cell Recombination Device"">""A"" Cell Recombination Device</a></span> or any Alien and <span><a data-name=""Planet Pollutant Virus"">Planet Pollutant Virus</a></span> to prevent your opponent from activating any monster effects. Only their Normal Summon can activate their trigger or quick effect before you can lock your opponent but that's not too worrying.  The problem with this is that this lock requires Slicer and 2 additional cards. However Slicer can only add one of these to your hand. You could open the other one but that's 1 handtrap or extender less in your opening hand.  Instead this deck aims to end on <span><a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a></span> plus <span><a data-name=""Alien Kid"">Alien Kid</a></span> and <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star""><span>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</span> or </a><a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a>. This allows their normal summon to activated it's ignition effects and attack your Kid but with Dingirsu or Harbinger on your side of the field you don't have to worry about that.  &nbsp;  <span>The Combo:</span>  All you need is either Snake Rain and a single extender or Nunu and two extenders. Remember how I said this combo was non-linear? Depending on your hand, cards like Nauya can change the line of plays and extenders needed. In the end it's best to to some test hands and get to know which cards can achieve what endboard. Anyways, you're not allowed to embedd DB replays into your deck description so <strong>I'll post the combo replay into the comments</strong> and give you some remarks here. <ul>  	<li>This is possible regardless of the extender.</li>  	<li>If you open <span><a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a></span> you can search <span><a data-name=""Kagetokage"">Kagetokage</a></span> instead. You have to keep him until you summon Alien Kid and then tribute him for Aleirtt. This might require you to send a Reptile for Snake Rain/Zohah, can't remember to be exact.</li>  	<li>Before anyone tries to backseat in the comments. Yes, you can summon <span><a data-name=""Nunu, the Ogdoadic Remnant"">Nunu, the Ogdoadic Remnant</a></span> if you control a non-Ogdoadic as long as you control an Ogdoadic monster, too.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>The Card by Card:</span>  Well not exactly card by card. I'll just explain some of the choices I made. <ul>  	<li>Extenders: <ul>  	<li>I'm playing the Level 4s at 2 copies a piece since 6 in total are enough and both <span>P</span><a data-name=""rimula the Rikka Fairy""><span>rimula the Rikka Fairy</span></a> and <span><a data-name=""Stardust Trail"">Stardust Trail</a></span> do the exact same. Stardust Trail can summon itself from the GY, which is great but 2-2 is definitly better since the two in hand means one card is dead regardless.</li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</a></span> is the best in my opinion. This one doesn't help with <span><a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a></span> but instead helps with the r8nks. If you can't make the lock because you didnt draw the right cards or got interrupted this one can also loop a card out of your opponents hand, which is especially funny if you used <span><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a></span> previously this turn.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>All the Called By The Graves: <ul>  	<li>Besides the limited <span><a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a></span> this deck is playing 4 honorary Called By The Graves. There are a lot of steps in which Gamme is live, with Snake Rain for example, turning him into practically 3 more copies of Called By. The Last one is <span><a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a></span>, or rather <span><a data-name=""Millennium-Eyes Restrict"">Millennium-Eyes Restrict</a></span>.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>The Combo Cards: <ul>  	<li>Usually you'll see <span><a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a></span> played at three. It is, however searched through the combo and opening it never feels that good. This deck is not reliant on a second Lily for follow-up plays so I cut it down to one.</li>  	<li>The Alien engine is also reduced to it's minimum. This deck only uses Kid for the Slicer lock so I cut all the other Alien cards. The one Alien Stealthbuster is in there since you might not always be able to use Tsuchinoko to gain A-Counters for Slicer. Also it's a nice follow-up when it's in the GY.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Honorable Mentions: <ul>  	<li>I could've included Accesscode but ED space is tight and I figured the deck isn't too dependent on it with <span><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></span>, yknow.</li>  	<li>You might've noticed that I play <span><a data-name=""Teardrop the Rikka Queen"">Teardrop the Rikka Queen</a></span> instead of <span><a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a></span>. That's because next I don't see the point in running a knockoff Mechaba and forfeit any spot removal. Zoodiac doesn't care about negates, they summon a Zeus without activating a single effect, the meta is crawling with decks that can chainblock and with Swordsoul it'll only get worse. That's why I opted for the card that helps remove threats from the field.</li>  	<li>I guess you could play around with Trade-In, since the 8s are searchable with the Feral King, but I feel like that wouldn't make too much sense in this deck, that's so low on 8s.</li>  	<li>My last honorable mention are the Alien extenders. Both <span><a data-name=""Alien Overlord"">Alien Overlord</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Alien Dog"">Alien Dog</a></span> can extend. Overlord once you sent Stealthbuster and Alien Dog right at the end after summoning Kid off of Slicer. But these extenders extend a tad to late for my taste. I'm content with the numbers of extenders I'm running and they all feel better than these two.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Flexibility:</span>  <span>The reason I find this deck to be more competetively viable than other Ogdoadic Alien or Reptilianne-Add-Eleven-Cards builds is that through these extenders you'll find yourself to easily alternate from establishing the Slicer Lock to summoning a Dragoon of Verte. Since that requires less monsters you might very well have enough ressources to also summon a Teardrop or Harbinger in addition to that Dragoon. Yet there are still plenty of handtraps in this deck to make sure you don't auto-lose going second as well as increasing the strength on the board you end on. Dragoon itself may not do all that much, but add an</span> <span><a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a></span> <span>or</span> <span><a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></span> <span>into the mix and your might just have enough to turn it around next turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Side deck is full of random Ogdoadic cards as ygoprodeck seems to think I'm playing Aliens and Psy-Frames exclusively.</span> <div class=""cardfront unselectable""> <div class=""cardfront_content""></div> </div>"

Ideally, the strategy here is to swarm the field with the Battlewasps to go into your Synchro monsters and Synchro-climbing since Azusa counts as a Tuner monster as well. Parasite Paranoid is good to trap an opponent's monster and make them unable to attack your insects and then you can Cocoon of Ultra Evolution into a boss monster like Metamorphosed Insect Queen to give blanket protection to the insects. Corrosive Scales is good against other swarm decks as they'll just keep losing attack for every card they activate. Ideally you'd want to attached Scales to Uru to make you be unable to be attacked (as long as you have Spider Web on the field. NOTE: Field Barrier would be a good tech card to sub just in case). To help with the survivability, Scrum Force is used in tandem with Spider Web. Enjoy!"

So I have built a Beetrooper/Inzektor deck with a Dragoon splash. I am somewhat familiar with Inzektors as I came back into Yugioh around the time they were released though I do not know all of the cards or combos so advice is highly welcomed. The basic feel I got looking at these 2 is the Beetroopers supplementing the Inzektors in swarming out Extra Deck monsters as a combo deck. If there is anything that would be suggested to either change and all please do not hesitate to let me know, first deck I've built on my own in a long time.

He is a monster with 10,000 ATK in your turn and cannot be destroyed by battle  This Deck is centralized in Summoning Armityle the Chaos Phantasm through the effect of Armityle the Chaos Phantasm-Phantom of Fury or directly using the fusion magic of the archetype by Banishing from your Hand,Field and/or Graveyard the 3 Sacred beasts:Hamon,Raviel and Uria  <b>&#x26ab;</b>The Combo starters are:Dark Beckoning Beast And Opening of the Spirit Gates.  With Dark beckoning beast you can search for any card of the archtype and gives you an extra normal Summon of a Fiend 0ATK/0DEF Who are Dark Summoning Beast,Chaos Summoning Beast and Chaos core. With this card you mainly want to seek the opening of the spirit gates or if you started with opening you want to search Dark Beckoning beast. If You have the Opening in hand you could Search for Awakening of the Sacred Beasts,It allows you to gain effects according to the number of Sacred Beasts you control  With Opening of the Spirit gates is similar to the effect of Beckoning but you can only search Monsters of the Archtype  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Chaos Summonig Beast its one form to get on the field one Sacred Beast,is a level 1 monster that can be summon with one for one. The efect is he can tribute itself to summon from the hand Hamon,Raviel or Uria. He has other effect in the Gy that he can banish itself to search  Fallen Paradise  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Fallen Paradise,is the field spell that gives protect from targeting and protection from destruction of Spell Traps of the opponent and the other effect that you can draw 2 cards if you control a Sacred beast or Armityle in the field  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Dark Summoning Beast its the other form to get a Beast on the field,is a level 5 monster that you can search with Opening of the spirit gates or Dark Beckoning beast.This card can tribute itself to summon from the deck a Sacred Beast but you cannot attack until the end of this turn. While is on the Gy you can banish it to add a sacred beast from the deck to the hand  The 3 beasts has a support card who helps one or other beast:  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Hamon has Cerulean Skyfire:First you can summon hamon with face down spells.Its a Negate without responding by changing to defence hamon. When one Sacred Beast leaves the field you dont take any damage for the rest of the turn  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Uria has Hyper Blaze:You can summon Uria with face down traps.Whe Uria Attacks or its attacked you can send one continuous trap from the deck to the Gy and Uria will win ATK equal to the field Face traps x1000. The other effect is when you have a level 10 Monster you can discard one card and add from the Gy a Sacred  beast or special summon it ignoring it summon condition  <b>&#x26ab;</b>Raviel Has Shimmering Scraper:You can discard this card to double the ATK of Raviel and he can attack all the opponent monsters  <b>&#x26ab;</b>The Combo starters are:Dark Beckoning Beast And Opening of the Spirit Gates.If you start with one you search the other. <p class=""tw-data-text tw-text-large XcVN5d tw-ta"" dir=""ltr"" data-placeholder=""Traducción""><b>&#x26ab;</b><span>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts:It has 3 Effects depending of the Diferent Sacred Beasts you control_First:You gain life when your oponent summon a monster by its ATK_Second:Your opponent has his activated monsters effect negated_Third:Any monster that is sent to the oponent gy is Banished insted</span></p> (Heres a Basic Combo)If you start with the 2 searchrs you can do this:Start with opening of the spirit gates Search Dark summoning beast,then you normal summon Dark Beckoning Beast then search Chaos summoning beast.  Now in hand you have Dark and Chaos Summoning beast.You use the effect of the extra normal summon of Beckoning and tribute summon Dark Summoning,then use the effect to summmon a Sacred Beast. Now you have 2 fiends 0ATK/0DEF in gy.The next thing you would do is ti use the seccond effect of opening to discard for cost Chaos and summon it. Now you use the effect in gy of Dark summoning to search the other beast you want to summon with chaos summonig beast. You use Chaos summoning beast effect to tribute it and summon the beast you search with dark summoning beast or other in your hand. After you do that you use the second effect of Chaos summoning beast to add Fallen paradise and activate it and draw 2 cards.  N<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">ow the combo is divided into several things because you would have approximately 5 cards still, you can do several things if for example ... You have the third other beast in hand(Now you can do two things to end in Armityle)First:use directly Dimension Fusion Destruccion to end in Armityle and have it indestructible with Fallen paradise and his protection from destruction+the damage negated for the Fusion Card or the Other Armityle to sweap the oponent board by banishing all the cards he controls in the end phase and summon the Armityle ingnoring his summon conditions.Second:If You dont have the Fusion Card you use the 2 beasts you would control to make Verte anaconda and use his effect to send the card and summon one or other armityle.</span>  Other combo to get fast Armityle is With the two starters,search for example with dark beckoning beast opening of the spirit gates,or vice versa its the same but with the other you search you would add Chaos core then normal summon Chaos core with the Extra of Dark Beckoning beast,now you link summon almiraj with Dark Beckoning Beast and use its effect to target Chaos core and use the effect of Chaos core to send the 3 Sacred Beasts to the Gy,now you have the materials in Gy the next thing you should do to get Armityle is two things use the effect of Opening of spirit gates to special summon Dark Beckoning Beast then link summon with the two effect monster Verte Anaconda and use the effect to send Dimension Fusion Destruction and Summon Armityle.

Okay, so look, Evil Eyes are actually pretty close. This is for one reason and one reason alone - Serziel equipped with Selene represents a hard to interact with interruption, and potentially doubles as an engine piece depending on how your own deck is constructed. This means Serziel and your field spell both represent one easy interruption, and you can build the rest of the deck, theoretically, not around bad Evil Eye cards, but around another engine that interacts on a one-for-one basis.  Trying to decide on that engine took me a little bit of thought. Since Serziel is our normal summon and we don't end on an extra-deck monster Dogmatika was out, and so were a lot of the engines that might benefit from Serziel on the table. We want it to be a backrow deck if possible, and if possible we want it to benefit from popping our own cards. Eldlich was the obvious choice - it is a little light on the number of interruptions it puts on the table, but it has phenomenal grind game, good board breaking ability, and a fantastic boss monster in Eldlich the Golden Lord, conveniently a level 10 to make Trains (Choo choo!). The idea is to use our normal summon to drop Serziel and back him up with Golden land cards and good generic interruptions. Is this better than Ecclesia or Aleister? Oh almost certainly not. But it's a semi-competitive way to play Serziel, perhaps the most competitive way to play Serziel. And we can hope Fiend monsters get an actual good archetype sometime in the future.  I wanted to keep the Evil Eye package nice and tight. We have the field spell to search Serziel, which in this deck is much better than just seeing Serziel naturally, by virtue of putting an Evil Eye Spell Card on the field. This plus Cursed Eldland means you have Serziel setup + Eldlich right on the board. Very useful. We have Terraforming, our fourth copy of the field spell. We have Serziel, obviously. We have 1 Evil Eye of Selene, and one Evil Eye Retribution. Selene is obligatory, since it turns on Serziel while protecting him. We want something to search when we already have Selene, and a Spell negate is the obvious pick. In some situations game 2 it might be even more important to have the spell negate turn 1 than a repeatable pop anyways, and it is a good card to draw if you have Serziel. It also has some other good traits, like hitting traps and not being negatable, and being a countertrap as well.  The only problem I have with the Eldlich package is you really need to run a lot of cards to make it work. 3 Golden Lord seems essential, since you need to have one of these to turn on your traps and really you want as many as possible for the deck to work. Even semi-limiting this card would seriously reduce its grind game, and we want to take full advantage of having 3 copies. We also have 3 Cursed Eldland, which starts as 3 more copies of Golden Lord, but also adds Golden Land spells and works as a spell on the field for all that text on Eldlich. This plus Evil Eye Domain sets up your whole game. Golden Land Forever is your generic countertrap, it's honestly hard to evaluate this card. Being an Omni-negate counter trap is sometimes very good, but having to tribute a Zombie is really very bad, but it is searchable. 3 Conquistador seems essential, so we can loop our Lich cards long time. 2 Huaquero is fine, it frees up space for a single White Eldlixer. 3 Red is pretty obligatory in these lists, but I still really like the 1 White. It feels like you're leaving a lot of cards on the table when you don't run some of the bad Eldlixers. It's really only 1, but that one interruption is pretty important.  3 Pot of Extravagance, because we're a cheesy control deck that needs card advantage. Yes, Prosperity would help ensure our Evil Eye normal summ0n, but I actually think Eldlich wants the raw card advantage far more than Evil Eye wants the search, and the Eldlich engine is literally and figuratively bigger.  2 Dogmatika Punishment are run as good generic traps. These could be Solemns, or Compulse, or whatever you want to run, but I like the 2 for 1 of Punishment, and being locked out of the extra deck literally doesn't matter for this deck. Really, the fact that this list runs these is a sign I should just play Dogmatika engine over Evil Eyes, but I also can't think of a better shell for Evil Eyes. Like I said, Serziel is close.  Good hand traps are good. Called was such a good staple they limited it, and honestly? Still salty, but I'll run the 1."

I'll leave it here so feel free to check it out.</span>  <span>Everything in this deck is doing something. Between 16 handtraps, 7 backrow, 12 starter cards you only have 5 cards that don't enable some sort of interaction. And two of these - Invokation &amp; Artifact Scythe - still do if you also draw their respective half of the combo! So generally speaking you are running <em>37 interactive cards</em>.</span>  <span>I chose to forgo the HERO combos and instead focused solely on both Invoked and Destroy Phoenix Enforcer.

It's hard to consistently empty your hand if you're running so many handtraps and play multiple cards that you can only use once a turn each (like Aleister and Meltdown). Since you'll be Fusion Summoning every turn you can consistently summon Disk Commander, draw 2 and then Link Summon <span><a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a></span> and still go plus 1.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a></span><span>: In case you draw both Fusion Destiny and the Sky Striker cards you can summon Dagda, set a Scythe and then pop if with DPE on your opponent's turn.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>The other Artifacts:</span> <span><a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a></span> <span>is not only great to summon off of <a data-name=""Artifact Sanctum"">Artifact Sanctum</a> but doesn't even brick since you can set it and destroy it with DPE.</span> <span><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></span> <span>can tribute itself from the field, just like it would in hand. So depending on the deck you're facing summoning this one might just give you the edge. Also functions as a handtrap if drawn.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a></span> &amp; <span><a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a></span>: <span>Aleister is a Spellcaster and so is Veiler. Cross-Sheep could also summon Aleister from GY if you maange to get one in there (can also summon Veiler of course) to then summon Selene, resummon the Spellcaster of your choice and then push for lethal with Accesscode.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Sky-Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor"">Sky-Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor</a></span>: <span>Depending on the gamestate you might want to search this off of Engage. Not only does this provide flexibility, it is also a solid card on it's own.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Mind that this is a decklist, that I can see myself playing with my own cards. Therefore I am only running what's available to me within my financial range. That's why I'm only running one Mechaba, Invokation and one DPE and also Almiraj and Gardna instead of Artemis. Out of all of these I'd recommend a second Mechaba the most and might just get my hands on another one myself, to summon a Mechaba with Mechaba to trigger the Cross-Sheep.</span>  <span>Dasher doesn't really do anything in this deck and can be substituted for literally any Level 6 or higher Destiny HERO. There's not many monster you'd like to summon, you could also play Plasma instead.</span>  Pot of Prosperity might also find it's place in a decklist or two, since there are a lot of situational cards in the ED."

I will still keep this up here on YGOProDeck so you can see what I had done here. Fortunately, if you are still wanting a guide to The Phantom Knights, I have a new one in the works. Keep your eyes peeled out for it! - Zeekou</strong>  &nbsp;  The Phantom Knights is an archetype of DARK Warriors that like to be in the graveyard to activate their effects. Dating all the way back to 2016 (saying that's 5 years ago feels illegal), in the set <em>Wing Raiders</em> along with Raid Raptors. Later in 2019, They got a new link monster in the <em>Legendary Hero Decks</em> box, which just like many other cards, got abused the hell out of in decks that aren't in the archetype itself. Later later, in 2020's set <em>Phantom Rage</em>, they got more support in the form of, most notably, <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> along with some other support that tries to mix Phantom Knights and Raid Raptors together, tying back to <em>Winge Raiders </em>where they both debuted in, which is cute i guess. Now with an archetype that's been around for quite a while should have a good number of cards to go through, so let's just get into it in a chronological order. <h2>MONSTERS:</h2> <h3>The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a> was originally released in <em>Wing Raiders </em>as an Ultra Rare. The card has two effects, The first one isn't great but it isn't particularly bad per say. The effect states: ""<strong>If this card is in Attack Position: You can target 1 DARK monster on the field; change this card to Defense Position, and if you do, that monster gains 800 ATK/DEF until the end of your opponent's turn.</strong>"" This effect has it's uses, such as buffing up your Bardiche to help protect it. this is actually it's greatest use, if you have a cloak on field during your combo, go ahead and activate it. No one in their right mind would want to negate it. The second effect is what makes this card good, the effect states: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your Deck to your hand, except ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"">The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak</a>"".</strong>"" Just reading this effect you can know that this effect is really strong. Now to keep this a little bit less confusing, ""<strong><span>The Phantom Knights</span></strong>"" Cards are your monsters and your traps that can become monsters. Everything else in the archetype is just ""<span><strong>Phantom Knights</strong></span>"". to make this even easier to understand, every ""<span><strong>The Phantom Knights</strong></span>"" will be highlighted in Purple and ""<strong><span>Phantom Knights</span></strong>"" will be highlighted in Blue. Of course, both of these effects are a <strong>Hard Once Per Turn</strong>, so be sure to not activate his effects more than once.  Ratios: 2-3, in most builds, you're going to want at least 2 copies of this card. the utility it offers is just too great to pass up on. most of the time you can get away with 2 copies so for all you max-rarity lovers, don't worry about your bank account too hard here (although i doubt you guys do in the first place.) In some builds when you are just going for a PK engine, 1 of is perfectly fine and sometimes better than 2 <h3>The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</h3> Next up on the list is The <a data-name=""Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>, also releasing in <em>Wing Raiders </em>as a super rare. Like most other PKs, this card has two effects, one is a condition and the other an ignition. The condition effect reads: ""<strong>If you control a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand). You can only Special Summon ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>"" once per turn this way.</strong>"" This is a strong reason to run Silent Boots in your deck already, getting a free body on board just for having another PK on board. It's perfectly fair that this effect is once per turn. The second effect is what makes this card so important to PK decks, the effect reads: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; add 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand. You can only use this effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"">The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots</a>"" once per turn.</strong>"" Similarly to Ancient Cloak, this is an extremely useful search that opens up to free negates with <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>, but well get to that later.  Ratios 2-3. Even though you can do fine with just 2 copies, the sheer utility of this card makes it hard to not run a full playset. similarly to Ancient Cloak, when you are just going for a PK engine, just 1 copy can work better <h3>The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a> is an interesting card that only seems to have one effect but it actually has two. At the end of the card it reads: ""<strong>You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves"">The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves</a>"" once per turn.</strong>"" now with that clause out of the way we can read the first effect: ""<strong>A DARK Xyz Monster that was Summoned using this card on the field as Xyz Material gains this effect. ● If it is Xyz Summoned: It gains 1000 ATK.</strong>"" now this is a hefty attack boost that most people forget about when this can determine whether or not a card lives or dies, although it barely comes up. Now another thing most people don't know about is that this effect is a <strong>Mandatory Effect</strong>. Meaning if you use this card for Xyz Material, <strong>You have to Activate it</strong>. The second effect of this card is the one everyone knows about it. It reads: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; send 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your Deck to the GY. </strong>"" this effect is extremely strong. being able to send any card in the <strong>Entire Archetype</strong> is pretty ridiculous.  Ratios: 1-2. Although the sending effect is extremely powerful, the deck already has the ability to get cards in the graveyard. Not running it is putting yourself in a handicap, but its not great enough card to warrant running 3. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor"">The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor</a> is a good card <em>On Paper</em>, with two effects that have uses the first one reads: ""<strong>If a face-up ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster(s) you control is destroyed by battle or card effect: You can Special Summon this card from your hand.</strong>"" this effect is good for keeping board presence and having an established grind game. The second effect isn't as great but it's also good: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY and send 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your hand to the GY; draw 1 card.</strong>"" this effect is very valuable, being able to set up your graveyard and replace it with a new card in the same effect is pretty strong for grind game. Much like almost every other Phantom Knight card, the text ends with the clause ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor"">The Phantom Knights of Fragile Armor</a>"" once per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">""</span>  Ratios: none. even though these effects are strong, the fact that Fragile Armor is a level 4 stops it from being incorporated to more competent builds, and it honestly hurts me to say that because i love this card a lot. If only this card was level 3 it would automatically be a lot more useful to the point of being a 2-3of in every build. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm</h3> <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm"">The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm</a> was meant to be the big beater of the deck just from reading the first effect: ""<strong>If a ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card(s) is sent to your GY: This card gains 500 ATK.</strong>"" now since this deck can send at least one card to the grave per turn, this card can get pretty strong pretty fast, the second effect isn't that good but can have a use or two, it reads: ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; during the End Phase of this turn, add 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your GY to your hand.</strong>"" the only card this is useful for is recycling Phantom Knights' Fog Blade, but its not that useful. Of course the text ends with ""<strong>You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm"">The Phantom Knights of Cloven Helm</a>"" once per turn.</strong>""  Ratios: none. there are a few reasons, the first being that his attack gain is a <strong>Hard Once Per Turn</strong>, the second reason is the graveyard effect only really has one use which requires setup and to put the nail in the ghostly coffin, it's a level 4. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</h3> The most recent support from <em>Phantom Rage</em> is where shit gets real. <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a> was released as a secret rare in the set and for good reason. the first effect reads: ""<strong>You can discard 1 card; send 1 ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card from your Deck to the GY, except ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>"".</strong>"" now this effect automatically gives PK a solid normal summon option, getting up to 2 Phantom Knight cards in the grave with just 1 effect! now the second effect is what seals the deal, it reads: ""<strong>If another ""<span>Phantom Knights</span>"" card in your GY is banished, while this card is in your GY: You can Special Summon this card, but banish it when it leaves the field.</strong>"" this allows PK to have new combo routes just by doing things it would already be doing for combos! now that banish when it leaves the field clause sounds not so good but remember the confusing thing about Xyz Material. when a card is used for Xyz Material, they do not leave the field. This means if you use the effect to bring him back, just put him in an Xy monster for material and you just bypassed the entire downside of this card! now obviously this card has the ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">You can only use each effect of ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"">The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales</a>"" once per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" clause.</span> <div class=""card-arch"">Ratios: 2-3. although you only need 2 copies to do well with PKs, running 3 makes the deck just so much more consistent to pass up, being both a starter and an extender for the deck. But, if you are on a budget, running 2 is perfectly fine.</div> <h3>The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</h3> the other main deck monster added to the card pool from <em>Phantom Rage</em> is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>. with two effects that help combos be more explosive, the first reading: ""<strong>If a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster(s) is Special Summoned to your field (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand, then you can increase the Level of this card by 1.</strong>"" allowing another free body one board is undoubtedly strong, along with the option to make it level 4 which is neat. The second effect doesn't tend to come up as often but it's also good, it reads; ""<strong>You can banish this card from your GY; Special Summon 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster from your hand, except ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"">The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves</a>"", then you can increase its Level by</strong> <strong>1.</strong>"" Very similar to the first effect, also allowing the option for a level increase can come in handy for more specific combo routes. Of course this card has the once per turn clause that the rest of the cards do.  Ratios: 0-1. although not required in PK decks, it's handy to have on occasion. having more than 1 could brick your hand, but running none can put you out of a resource when you might need it. <h2>SPELLS:</h2> <h3>Phantom Knights' Spear</h3> <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Spear"">Phantom Knights' Spear</a> is one of 3 spell cards in the archetype, boasting 2 effects (shocker, i know) first one states: ""<strong>Each time your opponent activates a card or effect that targets a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster(s) you control, inflict 500 damage to your opponent immediately after it resolves.</strong>"" this effect is a bit redundant considering it has to be your opponent targeting your PKs, if this just said ""each time a card or effect that targets a ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" card you control is activated, inflict 500 damage to your opponent."" this card would be exponentially better. similarly to the other two weapon cards, it has a second effect that reads: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">If a DARK monster you control would be destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, you can banish this card from your GY instead.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" unlike the traps that revive cards from the grave, this one wants to keep stuff on the field, with the additional upside that it's any DARK monster. still doesn't mean the card is good though.</span>  Ratios: don't. just don't, this card has no reason to be played, even for the miniscule burn damage which is just as effective as A B A K I <h3>The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</h3> the other spell from PKs debut is <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic-Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic-Launch</a> (what a mouthful) this is the card that gives what extra deck type this would focus on, XYZ. The field effect is quite long, it says: ""<strong>During the Main Phase: Target 1 DARK Xyz Monster you control with no material; Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 DARK Xyz Monster that is 1 Rank higher than that monster you control, by using it as the Xyz Material, and if you do, attach this card to it as additional material. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon. Transfer its materials to the Summoned monster.)</strong>"" now this effect is pretty strong considering by how generic it is, but it has the drawback that the monster you want to rank up needs no materials, so it requires setup a bit too long for today's standards. This card has a second effect when it's in the graveyard, it reads: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">During your Main Phase: You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 DARK Xyz Monster you control; attach 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster from your hand to that monster as material.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" this effect is also pretty strong to keep Xyz materials flowing in the main boss monster from then and still today: <a data-name=""Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon"">Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon</a>.</span> <div class=""card-arch"">Ratios: 0-1. Despite the rather powerful effects, you really only want to run this if you want to do the <a data-name=""D/D/D Duo Dawn King Kali Yuga"">D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga</a> lock on your opponent's turn because of the setup it requires to be used in other instances.</div> <h3>Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</h3> the third and final spell in the archetype is also the only one with just one effect, releasing in <em>Phantom Rage</em>, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</a>, This effect is an actual wall so let's just have a look at it: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">During the Main Phase: Banish 1 or more DARK monsters from your GY, then target 1 DARK Xyz Monster you control; Special Summon from your Extra Deck, 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"", ""Raidraptor"", or ""Xyz Dragon"" Xyz Monster, whose Rank equals that of the targeted monster you control + the number of monsters banished, by using it as material, also for the rest of this turn after this card resolves, you cannot Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck, except Xyz Monsters. (This is treated as an Xyz Summon. Transfer its materials to the Summoned monster.) You can only activate 1 ""<a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force"">Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force</a>"" per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">""  this effect is similar to the other RUM, but this card has the advantage that it doesn't require setup and it has extra flexibility.</span>  Ratios: 0-1. Despite the powerful effect, you'll really only use it to get Requiem on board and having more than 1 can brick your hand, unless you decide to play a strictly pure build where 2 if fine, run 1 if you aren't going for the Kali Yuga play. <h2>TRAPS (the longest segment):</h2> <h3>Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</h3> Starting with the most infamous card in the archetype, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a> is an easily searchable card with two powerful effects, the first reading: ""<strong>Activate this card by targeting 1 Effect Monster on the field; negate that face-up monster's effects, that face-up monster cannot attack, also monsters cannot target that face-up monster for attacks. When it leaves the field, destroy this card</strong>"" obviously negates are powerful in a game like this, especially when they are easily accessible. the second effect is also fairly strong, it reads: ""<span class=""card-set-desc""><strong>You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster in your GY; Special Summon it, but banish it when it leaves the field. You can only use this effect of ""<a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"">Phantom Knights' Fog Blade</a>"" once per turn.</strong>"" obviously graveyard recursion with any monster in the archetype is pretty damn powerful, going back to the Torn Scales segment, you can completely bypass the banish downside by using the monster as Xyz Material.</span>  Ratios: 2-3. Running 2 gives you the ability to use one for a negate and the other as a combo extension. Running 3 however, gives you an extra PK name for the more grindy matches, but runs the risk of potentially clogging your hand. Use whichever suits your playstyle better. <h3>Phantom Knights' Sword</h3> the last of the weapons in the archetype, <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a> was part of the original wave of Phantom Knight cards with two effects, the first reading: ""<strong>Activate this card by targeting 1 face-up monster on the field; it gains 800 ATK, also if that target would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy this card instead. When it leaves the field, destroy this card.</strong>"" This effect isn't all that bad, but that doesn't mean it's good. The 800 ATK boost is nice, along with a one time protection which also sets it up in the grave isn't all too bad, unfortunately in today's climate, it's too slow to reliably use. Speaking of the grave setup, this second effect is what you get: ""<strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 ""<span>The Phantom Knights</span>"" monster in your GY; Special Summon it, but banish it when it leaves the field. You can only use this effect of ""Phantom Knights' Sword"" once per turn.</span></strong><span class=""card-set-desc"">"" that's right, the second effect is completely identical to Fog Blade's, and that's a good thing. Since Fog Blade's recursion effect is once per turn, using this card can allow you to get a second extension for combo routes.</span>  Ratios: 0-1. Despite the rather good effects, you aren't missing out on too much if you don't play it. Not to mention it's a bit of a garnet, the field effect is nice on occasion, but the grave effect is the main reason you would play it. Thankfully now, with Torn Scales, you can set it up in the grave much easier with their effect, i'd recommend running it instead of not at all, but then again, you don't miss out on too much if you don't. <h3 class=""card-arch"">Phantom Knights' Wing</h3> <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Wing"">Phantom Knights' Wing</a> and <a data-name=""Phantom Knights' Sword"">Phantom Knights' Sword</a> are practically the same in terms of effects, the only differences between the two are literally that Wing gives 300 less ATK, their name (of course), and that Wing is a normal trap as opposed to Sword, a continuous.  Ratios: 0-1. If you were to run sword, run this instead. While it has less ATK gain (oh no, what am I going to do without my 1600 ATK Ancient Cloak?!!?) the fact it's a normal trap gives it the ability to activate it's grave effect almost immediately as opposed to Sword since it stays on field. <h3>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</h3> the first of the trap cards that are also monsters is also the most splashable card in the archetype, as it doesn't need any other PK card to function efficiently. Reading the card, you'll find ""<strong>Special Summon this card in Defense Position as a Normal Monster (Warrior/DARK/Level 4/ATK 0/DEF 300). (This card is NOT treated as a Trap.) If you have no Traps in your GY, you can activate this card the turn it was Set. You can only activate 1 ""<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"">The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine</a>"" per turn.</strong>"" free board presence is always nice, especially with such a generic level being 4, as well as being a normal monster which can come into play if you're into those kinds of decks, on top of the fact it can be activated the turn it is set. take THAT <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>.  Ratios: 1. Always just play 1, any more can brick your hand especially because of it's level you can't really use it as a combo starter."

Normally they wouldn't really work together but the mermail and deep sea cards help support them and act as a kind of glue for the multiple archetypes. I hate seen all of the meta decks that do one thing over and over so in response I spent days making a deck myself that focused on making a variety of strong and adaptable plays. Most cards in the deck allow some form of search and removal. To be honest there are so many different combos I can't recall them all off the top of my head but the main ones that come to mind are the otk and the instant trishula combo. If you have nopenguin in your grave and penguin garden in your hand with one other card you can summon trihula from an empty board. Use garden to search emperor and then lower his level by 1 so you can normal summon him, then use his power to summon your second nopenguin and revive the first along with bringing out a copy of champion. Their total level is 11 and champion is a tuner so that's an instant trishula who will banish 3 cards your opponent controls. The other combo is an otk you usually start with having diva and one other water monster in your hand. It goes something like this: deep sea diva into neptabyss use his active to send dragoons to grave, add another water monster to hand with neptabyss and mermail abyssmegalo from dragoons then special summon megalo by sacraficing the 2 water monsters in hand then link summon marincess coral anemone with diva and neptabyss and use her ability to bring neptabyss back from the grave before sending it right back with megalos ability to let him attack twice and revive dragoons then you have a 2000 a 1800 and a 2400 that can attack twice all on field and you will also be able to remove cards from field before attacking if you used atlantean heavy infantry or atlantean marksman to summon megalo and summoning him lets you grab an equip that can cancel a trap card. and gives him 800 more attack for a total of 3200 that can swing twice along with the other monsters. These combos also have other ways to pull them off and are flexible in themselves. There are plenty more options available but you can discover them as you play the deck. In short I made this deck to be adaptable and versatile so you don't see the same thing over and over again but can still make strong plays. I hope people like it and try it out, have fun doing so!"

Updated with new cards.,"Basic Combo:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/hQkvdxp938I"">https://youtu.be/hQkvdxp938I</a>  Archetype Strategy:  Ursarctic are not very good, so you have to be sharp, know your deck and know your opponents deck. Ursarctic have two major weaknesses: any interruption and resource cost. The basic Ursarctic combo can be stopped with any hand-trap, so to mitigate the loss, we are running a going first build with traps. If your Ursarctic combo gets interrupted falling back on a <em>Solemn Judgement</em> can sometimes give you an extra turn. To recover our lost resources we must focus on cards that either give us additional card advantage or remove opponents card advantage. <em>Crystal Girl</em> can give you two searches and two bodies, making it a potential +3. <em>Ice Dragon's Prison</em> can banish a monster from your opponents GY and field, and if timed correctly to a <em>Monster Reborn</em>-like effect can be a potential -3 for the opponent.  Ursarctic specialize in high-level hand-trap monsters, they synergize with cards like <em>Fantastical Dragon, Phantazmay</em>; <em>Nibiru, the Primal Being</em>; or LV7 Kaiju which normally require a specific condition for high reward, but without that condition become dead cards in the hand. Ursarctic work around this by using them as fodder, so even if your opponent is not using Link monsters you can discard the <em>Fantastical Dragon, Phantazmay</em> to summon an Ursarctic instead and use their interruptions.  This build is designed to go first, but they can very easily switch to a going second build by swapping out your traps for high-level hand-trap monsters. I would argue that this archetype is supposed to go second with this strategy, however a last minute <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em> can completely wipe your board, losing you your advantage and the game. This archetype has no out to tower monsters like <em>Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</em>; you will have to play smart and make sure you run outs like Kaiju; <em>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</em>; or <em>Dark Ruler No More</em>.  This deck has a decent chance of winning against other rogue decks, but almost always loses against the meta. To win against a meta deck you really have to know when and where to strike your opponent, adapt your side deck to counter the current meta and abuse their weaknesses.  With the new support card <em>Ursarctic Radiation,</em> you can stomp out your opponent with seven draws! This card fixes all the decks issues... <strong>if you open with it</strong>. Since Ursarctic do not have an easy way to search this card trying to rely on it is not the best strategy. I believe this card simply replaces <em>Pinpoint Landing</em> as an archetype upgraded version and that's about it. You may think that running three would make the most sense and while yes it does improve your odds of opening with it, drawing two of this card or top decking it in a long game can lose you that game. I think two is a better ratio, but if you really want to try it I might suggest removing <em>Fury of Kairyu-Shin</em> for the third copy.  Hints:  Ursarctic effects lock you out of Xyz and Link monsters for the rest of the turn, however you can walk around this restriction by summoning your Ursarctic on your opponents turn. Just make sure that your opponent doesn't have any destruction on board or else you could lose those bodies.  <em>Crystal Girl</em> is a LV1 that can special summon itself from the GY while you control a water monster, combining with your LV8 Ursartic tuner to make a very easy LV9 synchro engine. <em>Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen</em> effect can constantly recover <em>Crystal Girl</em> from the banished zone for a LV9 synchro every turn.  <em>Ursarctic Septentrion</em> negates any monster effect on the field that does not have a level (Links and Xyz), however monsters like <em>Linkuriboh</em> or <em>Crystron Halqifibrax</em> leave the field as cost so their effects will not be negated by <em>Ursarctic Septentrion</em>.  <em>Ursarctic Quint Charge</em> can summon the fusion. Probably the most underrated card in the archetype, Quint Charge is extremely important for regenerating your resources and enabling <em>Ursarctic Grand Chariot</em> to destroy two cards on your opponents turn.  Ursarctic activate twice, once in hand and once on field, making it easy to fulfil <em>Stellar Wind Wolfrayet</em> five monster effect condition.  <em>Melffy Catty</em> can be used to search any LV7 Ursarctic or <em>Hop Ear Squadron</em> on your opponent's turn. You could also combine <em>Melffy Catty</em> with a LV8 Ursarctic tuner to synchro summon a LV10, and <em>Hop Ear Squadron</em> can be combined with LV7 Ursarctic to synchro LV9 on your opponents turn."

You want to get at least Serziel equipped with Selene, while you can use Branded cards for little combos or Albion to get some resource/recovery in the GY. You can also summon Albion if you want to use it for Evil Eye Empress but remember to do summon any of non-Fusion monster from the Extra before using Branded Opening that is used to summon Jester and use his effect. The Discard target should be Despian Tragedy to usually get the Branded in Red or Jubilation. Dramaturgia is a good material for Fusion Summoning so that you can summon her again and make Number 38 with Albion or keep it as a monster's effect negation.  If you go second you may have problem against boards with many negates, hope to have Kaiju and Impermanence or change with the Side Deck. However you can get advantage from your opponent having monsters on their board Special Summoning Ecclesia and another level 4 to summon Evilswarm to do some cleaning or go for other combos.  Not much to say for the Evil Eye part... Try to have in hand at least Serziel or Domain/Terraforming so you can have the basic kit. As written before, you want to discard Catoblepas from Deck so you can summon it and protect Selene or keep it as a recovery. Usually you summon him if you can summon the Empress to protect Selene. If your opponent doesn't have an out for spells you can just summon him to make the Ruler and then equip Selene. Remember that Ruler wants only Evil Eye monsters, so use the non-Evil Eye to summon Empress.  P.S. : Someone may think Nibiru is better than Sphere... But I like Balls."

It's for you.,"<em><strong>*Kaiju:</strong></em> Help you for: + Anti-Meta: Tribute their very powerful monsters like Dragoon, Divine Arsenal, or something else that you should Tribute them. + Fusion materials: Kaiju has all of the Attributes (LIGHT, DARK, FIRE, WATER, EARTH, WIND) for Fusion summon any Shaddoll and Invoked monsters. <em><strong>*Invoked:</strong></em> Help you to win. Invoked Mechaba to negate your opponent’s combos. For Fusion Summoned Invoked Purgatrio, you can also use Invocation and banish Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring from your GY. Raidjin can make your opponent out of Synchro, Xyz or Link Summoned by change a monster to face-down Defense Position. Also, you can use Invocation to Summon “Shaddoll” monsters. <em><strong>*Shaddoll:</strong> </em>Winda is very, very powerful. It lock-down almost of currently Meta now. Construct will say goodbye to Borrelsword (your opponent control). Grysta and Shekhinaga are also very good. <em><strong>*Handtraps and Traps:</strong></em> Negate your opponent’s combos. It’s very useful and so important for any Deck. <strong>- About Weaknesses:</strong> + Scared about hand-traps when activated “Shaddoll Fusion” without “Magical Meltdown”. + Extra Deck will be trashed when you cannot Special Summoned or negated their effects. + Low ATK. Although “Aleister the Invoker” makes them gain 1000 ATK, its ATK is also low. AT ALL, this Deck is POWERFUL (I think) xD."

End boards can include the familiar simorgh and Apex Avian/Barrier Statue Lock, a 3 material Apollousa, Naturia Beast, 4 material  AA-zeus, set revolt for shuraig.  This deck is also very capable of OTK'ing with ""Accesscode talker"".  Note: I will sometimes refer to Tri-brigade as TB  <hr />  &nbsp;  Starters:  Tenki/Fraktall --- send kit to GY --- send Nervall --- add any TB but ideally Kerass --- summon Kerass --- effect kerass banish 2 to SS ferrijet --- ""Ferrijet"" effect to summon from hand --- if you summoned a TB from hand you can link summon ""Kerass"" and ""Ferrijet"" to make ""Bearbrumm"" use the TB you summoned from hand to summon any link 2 from Extra deck and then link all of them to make 3 material ""Apollousa"" (She will be your 5th  summon), then Bearbrumm can search ""Revolt"" from the deck and set so you can summon ""Shuraij"" during opponent's turn.  Rescue cat v1 --- Summon rescue cat tribute rescue to summon ""TB Kerass"" and ""TB Kit"" rank both into centaurea and attack --- MP2 summon Downerd then you can make a 4 material Zeus  Rescue cat v2 --- Summon rescue cat tribute rescue to summon ""Valerifawn"" and ""PeroPero"" synchro into Naturia Beast against spell heavy decks  If you don't open any of the above starters, but you open  ""TB Nervall"" and/or ""TB Kit"" you can Normal summon on of them to Link into almiraj and activate their GY effect, this will unbrick your hand to search for ""Kerass"" and make some plays at the cost of your Normal Summon.  Even though this is a pure variant, we don't play any of the Tri-brigade spell and traps except for ""Revolt"" and it is only viable because you can guarantee search it with BearBrumm, the others are not that good and we play more hand traps and staples instead. Also the ratios of all the cards are adjustable, but all of them are viable options that have been tested.  <hr />  NOTES &amp; TIPS  -Since rescue cat is a beast it can be SS from the hand by ""Ferrijet"" and searched by ""Shuraij"" when it leaves the field  -Rescue cat tributes as cost, if they try to negate it by hand trap you can activate PSY-frame Gamma or Called by the grave, this is also useful when activating ""Fraktall"" from hand  -""Forbidden Droplet"" is an excellent card to dodge infinite impermanence  when your TB monsters try activate their effects to SS a link monster  -Take note when you link ""Bearrumm"" away and activate its effect, you can't Special Summon except Tri-brigade monsters.  -Valerifawn and peropero are mainly seen as garnets that you can summon off of rescue cat or discard fodder for ""Kerass"", but both of them have decent effects on their own, ""Valerifawn"" can SS ""Kit""or ""Kerass"" from GY and ""Peropero"" can punish from the GY.  -Sky Cavalry Centaurea can bounce problem cards from the field by attacking into to them and activating its effect, this way you won't be able to make a 4 material zeus, but keep in mind it is Beast-Warrior and you can link it  -You may be tempted to activate Triple Tactic Talents to draw 2 cards, but as a link centered deck, it may be more advantageous to take one of your opponents monster if you have at least 1 monster on boards and link them away for Accesscode or Apollousa or a Knightmare monster.  -This deck is not perfect, but it is very strong going both first and second, the extra deck and side deck can be adjusted to fit your playstyle as this deck is very flexible as seen in its popular usage as an engine in other Beast, Winged Beast, Beast Warrior Decks.  <hr />  &nbsp;"

So I tried to revieve the good old Orcust and here`s a way to play it consistenly.  As long as we havn`t got harp horror back, I decided to add a Phantom Knight engine. The main Problem of drawing Orcust monsters is, that they stay in hand unless you have Orcustrated return. So it`s a good idea to play cards like Forbidden Droplet or Twin Twister in the Side Deck when going second. Then, Torn Scales was released in Phantom Rage. Orcust players often decide to play the Rusty-combo in past, but now the Deck have a new Combo starter. Torn Scales also discards as cost for sending a Phantom Knight to the grave, so it often help to come in the Orcust Combo.  I also run 3 copies of Shade Brigandine, because I made good experiences while playing the deck more Combo-oriented. It makes easier to outplay interruptions, but you can cut it to 1 if you want. Another spice card ist Break Sword. This card can help going second a lot, one Torn Scales is at least a Destroy 1 + 2 link materiels and a discard.  All in all, i found a new way to play a competitve Orcust, while waiting on Harp Horror`s return. Have fun!"

I will explain my card choices below. You can choose whatever hand traps and side deck cards you want.</span>  <span>Main Deck</span>  2x Parallel eXceed - Pretty much just a free Abyss Dweller  <span>3x Prank-Kids Rocksies - One of 4 starters, if you get any of them it's pretty hard to brick. You can use this one to unbrick your hand a bit. Because this one isn't used to make Prank-Kids Battle Butler, usually try to use this one first</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Lampsies - One of 4 starters. The burn doesn't really matter, but it's still a good card and very important to the deck</span>  <span>3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - Just a good hand trap, pretty standard</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Dropsies - One of 4 starters. The life points don't really matter, but it’s still important. It can also be used to make toadally awesome, if that happens to be viable</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Fansies - One of the 4 starters. Use it to dump Prank-Kids Plan. Probably the worst of the bunch, but it's searchable by One for One and Thunder Dragon Fusion</span>  <span>2x Effect Veiler - A good hand trap. Infinite Impermanence is better, fight me</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Pranks - Pretty good for recovery, and a free token if necessary. I'm only playing one because it's searchable and not as good as other cards</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Place - Searches one of your starters, the other effect doesn’t really matter</span>  <span>3x Fusion Sage - Searches Polymerization</span>  <span>1x Instant Fusion - Free Prank-Kids Rocket Ride. If it didn’t summon an engine card, I probably wouldn't play it. Rocket Ride is good tho</span>  <span>1x One for One - Free starter, without even using a normal summon</span>  <span>3x Polymerization - Basically the only way to get 3 Prank-Kids Battle Butlers, which is why I play six. If you draw one, use Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo’s effect to send your starters back to your hand, then use Polymerization, and then summon Predaplant Verte Anaconda and use its effect to send Thunder Dragon Fusion to grave. Boom, three board wipes</span>  <span>1x Terraforming - Searches a card that searches a starter</span>  <span>1x Thunder Dragon Fusion - A Polymerization for cards in your graveyard and field. Usually used with Predaplant Verte Anaconda, but not bad in hand</span>  <span>1x Upstart Goblin - 39 card decks are good</span>  <span>1x Called by the Grave - Can be used as anti hand trap, or as a set interruption</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Pandemonium - A quick effect Polymerization. I only play one because it locks you into prank kids and it's searchable. Not my favorite card, but occasionally useful</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Plan - Just a recycler to dump with Prank-Kids Fansies. Doesn’t do anything on field, so probably just discard with Prank-Kids Place</span>  <span>3x Infinite Impermanence - A good hand trap, better than Effect Veiler in my correct opinion</span>  <span>Extra Deck</span>  <span>2x Prank-Kids Battle Butler - The prioritized endboard card for the deck. Board wipes are pretty insane</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Rocket Ride - Can be used to summon back starters from the grave</span>  1x Abyss Dweller - Basically a walking floodgate, and you can get one for free with Parallel eXceed  <span>1x Toadally Awesome - An extra negate, but make sure you prioritize Prank-Kids Battle Butlers</span>  <span>1x Prank-Kids Rip-Roarin-Roaster - A Harpie’s Feather Duster/ beater that’s easy to summon</span>  <span>1x Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior - Pretty much just there for Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon or I:P Masquerena’d Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax removal</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo - All effects are really useful here, and it activates your starters. It searches a Prank-Kids spell or trap. It can also add two starters from your grave to your hand</span>  <span>3x Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu - Activates your starters, and also adds another board wipe as long as it’s in grave</span>  <span>1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda - Use it to send Thunder Dragon Fusion to grave to summon a Prank-Kids Battle Butler at the end of your combo</span>  <span>1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess - Some extra negates, just make sure you prioritize Prank-Kids Battle Butlers</span>  <span>I hope you enjoy!</span>"

If you play against an annoying backrow deck, and you can`t combo any more, follow with Eldlich.  Both Prank-kids and Eldlich doesn`t need much space, and can also start out of one card. Eldlich make`s your prank-kids-deck more consinstend, by making the strategy more interruptable. It sounds weird, but accept when your combo is broken and try to come back while you can survive with Eldlich. There´re so many problems you can fix with Eldlich in the Prank-kids deck, and you have the space for the engine.  Be careful while fusion summon in your opponents turn, because you lock yourself into Prank-kids and can´t use Eldlich-traps any more.

This is lightsworn, what can you expect?","Lightsworn and Chaos, a combination almost as old as yugioh itself. Personally, I don't play creator or valkyria, but both can be used as extenders so feel free to adjust the deck. Very simple deck, summon raiden or lumina then raiden, mill, extend (graveyard effects, minerva, special summons, etc), build board. Its quite easy to put up a few interrupts like harbinger, crystia, apollousa, and draco berserker. harbinger can be made with chaos ruler and levianeer. Levianeer can very easily summon apollousa, etc. It struggles against spell/trap heavy decks going first or second so the side deck has backrow removal. It also struggles going second so extra cards like hand traps etc are helpful there. The easiest out to a boss monster is dingirsu. Enjoy."

Well luckily there's another unbanned boss monster: Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon  We might not be able to summo,"We'll build this deck around the usage Twin Headed-Thunder Dragon for rank 7 fodder or a Forbidden Memories-esque beatdown. Our main combo will require Polymerization, an OG Thunder Dragon or a Thunder Dragon Fusion, or ways to acquire them (we have plenty).  Having Polymerization allows us to churn out three Twin-Headed Thunder Dragons in a single turn thanks to the recycling of Thunder Dragon Fusion and Verte Anaconda.  You'd play this for the most part like a traditional TD deck. Aloof is an excellent card in this deck for getting TD pieces and setting up the Verte Anaconda we want on the field. Once we get a poly, TD and a TDF in our hand, we go the following:  1- Ditch a TD, add 1 and ditch it again so we have 2 in GY and 1 in our hand.  2- Activate TDF, get 1 Twin-Headed and put your TD that you discarded back into your deck.  3- Since there is still a TD in your hand, use its effect to discard itself and add 2 to hand.  4- Activate your poly, get another a Twin-Headed.  5- Now that you have your grave set up, now is the time for any extra deck set up or any additional special summons that you want.  6- Activate your Verte Anaconda get your third and final Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon.  7- Beat down your opponent with unrelenting nostalgia  This deck probably won't win you a regional but it should good for a laugh when you tell your friends you're playing Thunder Dragons in 2021."

Given not only that the tides had slowly turned into this archetypes favor with the introduction of BlackEyes, the Plunder Patroll Seaguide; but the cardpool that is currently picking up a lot of decks has especially gave this one a boost. While the main Plunder Patroll engine hasn't changed much (aside from bringing Red and Blue Beard to 2 copies instead of 3), newer cards had opened up for the decks versatility to further optimize it's hidden potential. Like Prank-Kids, Plunder Patroll has to reep in Hand-Traps to it's most wisest use (such as Effect Veiler, Ghost Belle, and Ash Blossom), all while piecing together a OTK board that rewards over refuses. Hence why Triple Tactics Talent is in the Main Deck over the usual Pot of Desires; and where cards like Twin Twister and Solemn Strike can breach the current state of the game. Extra Deck monsters like Borreload Savage Dragon, Apollousa, Daigusto Emeral, and Hope Harbinger Dragon are great emergency pieces to go into in case SHTF. Familiar Side Deck staples like Droll &amp; Lock Bird and Evenly Matched also come into play for cases, such as Shaddolls and Drytron. I know this isn't the best of both worlds; but taking it that Plunder Patroll has to rely on what they can get their hands on for until they get new support, it seems that the störtebeker jungs have to work with what they have until better archetype support comes around"

Avramax is kinda Easy to summon, with Cross Sheep and Construct and he is your main Attacker.  I am not sure about the Potential against Meta Decks but i guess it could be pretty good in Locals.  Curse of the Shadow Prison could be changed with an 3rd Ash or some other Fusionspell  like Nephe Shaddoll Fusion.

The main focus is to create a position you can control the game from when going first, knocking down your opponent as they try and set up. When going second the main goal is similar, but instead of preventing them from setting up you try and knock down what they've built. Eldlich and the Live☆Twin archetype synergize nicely together to grind the game out.  Sideboard's just cards I'm considering adding to the mainboard at current, not an actual suggestion."

It is meant to be a going second deck, since most Neos-fusions are better at breaking boards than setting up interruptions.  I decided to make this deck because I tried to build a Neo-Spacian deck in my childhood... but it got stolen. BIG Sadge :/  <span><strong>Card highlights</strong></span>  <span><strong>Monsters:</strong></span>  Most of the Neo-Spacians are outdated monsters released back in GX times.  The one exception is <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a>. It is a card that sees plenty of play in Isolde turbo, dark warrior abomination decks. It helps to play around handtraps.  The other three-off out of the <a>Neo-Spacian pool is </a><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Grand Mole"">Neo-Spacian Grand Mole</a><a>. It is probably best known out of bad childhood memories, bouncing your boss-monster again and again. ^^ </a>  The rest of the bunch is just there to deliver discard fodder and serve as possible fusion materials.  My favorite Neo-Spacian is <a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab"">Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab</a> for esthetic reasons.  Your best starter for the deck is <a data-name=""Neo Space Connector"">Neo Space Connector</a>. It brings out <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Neos"">Elemental HERO Neos</a> for free and can exchange itself for a Neo-Spacian from the GY.  <span><strong>Spells:</strong></span>  One of the strongest spells for Neo-Spacian is <a data-name=""Convert Contact"">Convert Contact</a>. It allows you to draw two for the cost of a discard and a mill.  <a data-name=""Contact Gate"">Contact Gate</a> helps you to get more Neo-Spacians on the field and to soften the downside of your Neos fusion monsters.  <a data-name=""Neos Fusion"">Neos Fusion</a> is the <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> for the deck. Not much else to say about that one.  <a data-name=""Miracle Contact"">Miracle Contact</a> recycles your Neo-Spacians and <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Neos"">Elemental HERO Neos</a>. It also is your only option to summon <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Cosmo Neos"">Elemental HERO Cosmo Neos</a> effectively.  &nbsp;  The deck shines more for nostalgic reasons than for playability, but I tried my best combining both.  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

Today in another version of the <strong>Triple Structure Deck Challenge</strong>, we’ll talk about one of the new Structure Decks in OCG: <strong>Overlay Universe</strong>. As the recent entries of the challenge, the deck list of this version will be available at the end of the wall of text here in case some cards appear missing. With that said, rules are the same: A 40-card Main Deck build using, at least, 30+ cards that are enlisted in the Structure Deck’s card list; where the Extra Deck can be edited by choice. With that said, let’s begin the deck’s breakdown.  <strong>Deck Analysis</strong>  Although it was originally marketed as a Structure Deck that would feature support cards for 3 of the mayor characters of the Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL anime, this Structure Deck brings support mostly to <strong>Yuma Ysukumo’s</strong> “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Deck: A deck consisting of consistently summon R4NK Xyz monsters to then use “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” Spell Cards to bring even bigger Xyz monsters.  Also, it needs to be noted that this “Deck” actually relies of many sub-archetypes that were used by Yuma &amp; Astral during the anime: those being “<strong>ZW -</strong>”, “<strong>ZS -</strong>”, “<strong>Onomat</strong>”, “<strong>Zexal</strong>”, “<strong>Xyz</strong>”, “<strong>Number</strong>”, “<strong>Utopic</strong>” “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” and what some call the Alliteration Squad (<strong>Gagaga, Gogogo, Zubaba &amp; Dododo</strong>). And just because I hate myself, I will explain each archetype, but only the cards used in the build.  <strong>ZW – &amp; ZS –</strong>  “<strong>ZW -</strong>”, which translates to “<strong>Zexal Weapon</strong>”, consists of monsters of various Levels, Types &amp; Attributes which share one peculiarity: they can equip themselves from the hand or field (depending the monster) to either a face-up “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, a “<strong>Number C39</strong>” monster, or more specifically to a <strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong>, if stated by the card. However, the “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monsters used here are from the variant that can equip to any “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster. As a note, I will only note how it can be equipped and what effects has while equipped to a monster:  <strong>*ZW – Tornado Bringer</strong>: Can be equipped from the hand or field. While equipped to a monster, that monster gains 1300 ATK and it cannot be targeted by your opponent’s card effects. Also, if the monster equipped with him would be <u>destroyed by battle</u>, <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong> destroys itself instead. While its protection is partial, it is intended to be paired with <strong>Lightning Blade</strong> for the full setup, which will be explained right now.  <strong>*ZW – Lightning Blade</strong>: Can be equipped from the hand or field. While equipped to a monster, that monster gains 12oo ATK and, while equipped to a monster, all face-up “<strong>ZW -</strong>” cards you control cannot be destroyed by your opponent’s card effects. Also, if the monster equipped with Lightning Blade would be destroyed by a card effect, <strong>Lightning Blade</strong> destroys itself instead. When paired with <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong>, the equipped monster gains 2500 ATK, your opponent can’t target it with effects, all your “<strong>ZW -</strong>” cards cannot be destroyed by your opponent’s effects and that monster is protected once for battle destruction and once for effect destruction. This simple combo is the main reason both of them are always run when playing “<strong>ZW -</strong>”’s.  <strong>*ZW – Pegasus Twin Saber</strong>: This one is a bit more recent with its day view being in LIOV, and also having one of the weirdest gimmicks of “<strong>Utopia</strong>” decks: having less LP than your opponent. It can only be equipped from the field, but you can Special Summon it from the hand if your opponent LP is at least 2000 higher than yours. The equipped monster gains 1000 ATK and while equipped to a monster, you can negate 1 monster effect activated in your opponent’s field. Alongside some of the new Xyz monsters, this is one of many options this deck has for effect negation, even if limited to monster effects. Also, some of the new support can make it be equipped from the Deck.  <strong>*ZW – Asura Strike</strong>: Can be equipped from the hand or field. The equipped monster gains 1000 ATK and while equipped to a monster, that monster can attack all monsters your opponent controls once each. Since this deck can actually get some high attack monsters, it can help to wipe out a board if your opponent doesn’t have an answer to it.  <strong>*ZW – Eagle Claw</strong>: In comparison to Pegasus, its effects are quite similar. It can only be equipped on the field to a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, but it can Special Summon from the hand if your opponent’s LP is at least 2000 or higher than yours. The equipped monster by this effect gains 2000 ATK and, while equipped to a monster, can negate the activation of a Trap Card or effect. Is mostly run to add more negates to the end board.  <strong>*ZW – Dragonic Halberd</strong>: While not running his Utopia Ray counterpart, Halberd is a rather good extender to run, although you might need <strong>RUM Zexal Force</strong> to summon it. Is a Rank 5 DARK Dragon that requires 2 Level 5 materials and it cannot attack directly. You can detach 1 material from this card to search 1 “<strong>Zexal</strong>” Spell/Trap from the Deck to your hand. Also, you can target 1 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster on your field and equip this monster to it. That monster gains 3000 ATK, and if it destroys 1 monster by battle while equipped with this monster, you can Special Summon any “<strong>ZW -</strong>” Monster cards equipped to it. You mostly summon it to get rid of garnets by searching <strong>Zexal Construct</strong> and using said garnet with it, or searching another <strong>RUM Zexal Force</strong> or <strong>Zexal Field</strong>. And the last effect, while a bit weird to pull off, it can be combo-ed with <strong>Shining Draw</strong>’s first effect, since <strong>Shining Draw</strong> does not count as if the equipped “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monsters were equipped by their effects, making Halberd Special Summon all of them, attack when them if you like to, and them re-equipping them properly with their effects.  On the other hand, “<strong>ZS -</strong>” monsters (which I’m going to guess it translates to <strong>Zexal Sage</strong>) consists of Warrior-Type monsters that grant positive effects when paired with “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monsters. Most of this support comes from LIOV, but is heavily recommended to try out if attempting this deck for the challenge:  <strong>**ZS – Ascended Sage</strong>: A Level 4 LIGHT Warrior monster that can Special Summon itself from the hand if you control no cards. If it is used for the Xyz Summon of a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster, you can add 1 “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” Normal Spell from the Deck to the hand (if you wondered, there are some “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” Quickplay Spell cards, and some of them are kind of busted). “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” cards are probably your main access to this deck’s new boss monster, so it’s recommended to run at 2-3 to secure one. Just remember its summoning condition.  <strong>**ZS – Armed Sage</strong>: Another Level 4 LIGHT Warrior monster that can Special Summon itself from the hand if the other monster you control is a Level 4 monster except another copy of itself. If used for the Xyz Summon of a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, you can add 1 “ZW -” monster from the Deck to your hand. One of your most reliable plays is open with both Sages for a double search, most of the time using them to summon <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double</strong> so it can also summon any “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster with its effect.  <strong>**ZS – Utopic Sage</strong>: Also, being new support from the Structure Deck, is a generic Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior Xyz Monster that requires 2 Level 4 monsters. You can detach 2 materials to Special Summon 1 “<strong>ZW -</strong>” or “<strong>ZS -</strong>” monster from the Deck but you’re locked to only Special Summoning Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn, and you can only attack with “<strong>Number</strong>” monsters that turn. If a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>Utopic</strong>” Xyz Monster which is original attribute is LIGHT would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this monster from the field or GY to prevent it. In case you didn’t open with <strong>Ascended Sage</strong> or <strong>Armed Sage</strong>; or you wanted to bring a “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster to equip to a monster, <strong>Utopic Sage</strong> can help with both. Keep in mind that he’s a “<strong>Utopic</strong>” monster and not an “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, meaning if you use both Sages to bring him out, you cannot search with their effects.  <strong>Alliteration Squad, Onomat &amp; Utopic</strong>  These 3 archetypes consist of mostly Level 4 monsters and some Spell Cards that will help you to bring Rank 4 monsters fast. Really fast. Starting with the Alliteration Squad, it consists of 4 smaller archetypes: <strong>Gagaga, Gogogo, Dododo</strong> and <strong>Zubaba</strong>. All these archetypes have their own strengths, but besides being played by Yuma in the anime, the main reason they are connected are due to their simple but effective swarming effects to bring Rank 4 Xyz monsters later.  <strong>***Zubababancho Gagagacoat</strong>: Alongside 2 more monsters that were featured in the<strong> Legendary Duelist: Magical Hero</strong> set, is the first one treated as more than 1 archetype. Is a Level 4 EARTH Warrior that can Special Summon itself from the hand if you control another “<strong>Zubaba</strong>” or “<strong>Gagaga</strong>” monster, except another copy of itself. It can also target 1 “<strong>Gogogo</strong>” or “<strong>Dododo</strong>” monster in your GY and Special Summon it, but you can only Special Summon Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. It’s always run at 3 with said 2 monsters since they act as an engine that can summon 2 or even 3 Rank 4 Xyz monsters with the right hand.  <strong>***Dodododwarf Gogogoglove</strong>: This is the second monster of said engine, being a Level 4 EARTH Rock monster that can Special Summon 1 “<strong>Zubaba</strong>” or “<strong>Gagaga</strong>” monster from your hand. If this card is in the GY, but you control a “<strong>Dododo</strong>” or “<strong>Gogogo</strong>” monster except another copy of itself, you can Special Summon it from the GY but is banished if it leaves the field. The self-banishing setback is avoided if it is used in a Xyz Summon, since Xyz materials are sent to the GY regarding if it were meant to be banished by its own effect.  Next, we have <strong>Onomat </strong>and <strong>Utopic</strong>, which is mostly support cards that works with every archetype member of the <strong>Alliteration Squad </strong>and some of the other archetypes used in the deck.  <strong>***Utopic Onomatopoeia</strong>: Is a Level 4 LIGHT Warrior that is treated as a card of all 4 archetypes of the Alliteration Squad (meaning he’s also a “Gagaga”, “Gogogo”, “Zubaba” and “Dododo” card). During the Main Phase, you can Special Summon up to 1 of each “Zubaba”, “Gagaga”, “Gogogo” and/or “Dododo” monster except another copy of itself in Defense Position, but you’re locked to Xyz monsters for the rest of the turn. This is your main playmaker and your main interaction with the effects of Coat and Glove, being the third member of the engine mentioned earlier.  <strong>*Utopic Astral Hope</strong>: Being new support from the Structure Deck, is a Level 4 LIGHT Warrior that can Special Summon itself from the hand if there is an Xyz monster on the field. You can send 1 other card from the hand or field to the GY to add 1 “<strong>Xyz</strong>”, “<strong>Onomat</strong>”, “<strong>Zexal</strong>” or “<strong>Number</strong>” Spell/Trap card from the Deck to your hand. This one, while being another free monster and a backrow searcher, the setup needed and the fact this decklist is already tight with the ratios, it is recommended to run in smaller ratios, usually at 1 or 2.  <strong>**Onomatopaira</strong>: Now starting with the backrow support, this is a Spell card that can send 1 card from the hand to the GY to add 2 monsters that are either a “<strong>Zubaba</strong>”, “<strong>Gagaga</strong>”, “<strong>Gogogo</strong>” or “<strong>Dododo</strong>” monster; but they cannot be from the same group. Is a simple yet effective double ROTA for your Deck. If you run a deck more dedicated to the <strong>Alliteration Squad</strong>, max out on this one alongside…  <strong>**Onomatopickup</strong>: A Continuous Spell card that when activated can add 1 “<strong>Onomat</strong>” card from the Deck to the hand. It also has another effect to modify the level of all monsters you control, but that one is more reliable for more dedicated <strong>Alliteration Squad</strong> Decks. Its main purpose here is to search <strong>Utopic Onomatopoeia</strong> or <strong>Onomatopaira</strong>, whatever is needed at the moment.  <strong>Zexal, Rank-Up-Magic, Xyz &amp; Number</strong>  This section is pretty much about most of the backrow this deck runs that supports the deck’s playstyle.  <strong>**Zexal Construction</strong>: Coming from LIOV, is a Spell card that requires to reveal 1 card in your hand to activate. If you do, you can add 1 “ZW -” monster, 1 “ZS -” monster, 1 “Zexal” Spell/Trap card, 1 “Rank-Up-Magic” Spell card OR 1 “Rank-Down-Spell” card; but if you do, the revealed card is shuffled into the Deck. This is also one of your backrow searchers, while also getting rid of any garnet or unnecessary card at the moment. Just because this deck list is tight, I run 2; but if possible, max out of it.  <strong>*Zexal Field</strong>: Is their new Field Spell, that prevent your opponent to activate cards or effects in response to the effects that would target an Xyz monster you control. If you Special Summon an Xyz monster(s), you can target 1 of those monsters and you can attach another Xyz monster from the Extra Deck or GY to that monster. Lastly, during the Draw Phase, before drawing, you can place 1 “<strong>Shining Draw</strong>” from the Deck on top of the deck. Is used only to prevent your opponent to negate any “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>”, equipping a “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster or interacting with your Xyz monsters. The <strong>Shining Draw</strong> setup is a nice extra, since <strong>Shining Draw’s</strong> second effect makes it another “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>”, almost being an extra <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>. Also, you can use <strong>ZS – Utopic Sages</strong> from the Extra Deck to give them to fuel your Xyz monster on the field, to then use them as materials and setup the GY for their protection effect.  <strong>**Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</strong>: Is a Spell card that targets 1 Xyz monster you control and Special Summon from the Extra Deck 1 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster that is 1 Rank higher that the targeted monster, using it as material and transferring its materials to the summoned monster. Then, you can take 1 “<strong>ZW -</strong>” or “<strong>ZS -</strong>” monster from your Deck and place it on top of the Deck. Lastly, if your opponent’s LP is 2000 or higher than yours, you can banish this card from the GY to draw 1 card. This is usually what you search with <strong>Ascended Sage</strong> if you opened with a <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>, if not, search the latter; and if you’re low on LP can net you a draw or even a search if you arrange the top card of the Deck.  <strong>**Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force</strong>: This card is new in this Structure Deck, which is a Spell card that can target a Rank 9 or lower “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster you control and Special Summon a Rank 10 or higher “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>Utopic</strong>” Xyz monster using that monster as material and transferring its Xyz materials to it. If an Xyz monster is Special Summoned by the effect of a Rank 10 or higher “<strong>Utopia</strong>” or “<strong>Utopic</strong>” Xyz monster, and this card is in your GY, you can target one of those monsters and attach it as a material. This card is your main access to your new boss monster, alongside <strong>Number 99: Utopic Dragon</strong>, that can also Special Summon Xyz monsters. (Spoilers: the new boss monster specializes in Special Summoning Xyz monsters).  <strong>***Xyz Change Tactics</strong>: Is a Continuous Spell card, but you can only control one due to its effect. When a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster is Xyz Summoned to your field, you can pay 500 LP to draw 1 card. Since this deck can Special Summon “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monsters a lot, it can net you a good plus, while setting your LP to the effects of <strong>ZW – Pegasus Twin Saber</strong>, <strong>Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force</strong> or even <strong>Hope for Escape</strong> to draw even more cards, if you happen to run it.  <strong>***Numbers Protect</strong>: Is a Counter Trap card that can negate the activation of a Spell/Trap card or monster effect and destroy it, while you control a “Number” Xyz monster. If a “Number” Xyz monster you control gets destroyed and this card is in your GY, you can Set it back to the field but it banishes when it leaves the field. It’s an archetype Solemn Judgement that is capable of recycling itself. The activation requirements are rather simple, but the recycle requirements are a bit slow.  <strong>Utopia</strong>  “<strong>Utopia</strong>” is the main archetype that mostly dominates your Extra Deck, consisting of Warrior Xyz monsters with mostly battle-related effects, with a side of summoning even stronger versions of themselves.  <strong>**Number 39: Utopia</strong>: This is Yuma’s ace monster, while also being one of your must-go to extend your Extra Deck plays. Is a Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior Xyz monster that requires 2 Level 4 monsters. If a monster declares an attack, you can detach 1 material to negate that attack. If this card does not have materials, it gets destroyed when targeted for an attack. While its effect brings a bit of defense, you mainly summon the original Utopia to interact with some of your cards.  <strong>*Number 39: Utopia Double</strong>: Is a Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior that requires 2 Level 4 monsters. As a Quick Effect, you can detach 1 material to add 1 “<strong>Double or Nothing!</strong>” from the Deck to the hand, and then you can Xyz Summon 1 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster using this monster as material and transferring its materials to it. The summoned monster’s ATK becomes double its original ATK but it cannot attack directly. Its effect can Xyz Summon ANY “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, giving you access to all of the listed monsters on this section and giving it a huge attack boost. If you ever draw <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> you can reshuffle it with <strong>Zexal Construction</strong> to still use Double’s effect. I love starting with him when I opened with any of the Sages, since I found funny how you can search up to 3 cards with only an Xyz monster.  <strong>*Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong>: Is a Rank 4 LIGHT Warrior that requires 3 Level 4 LIGHT monsters or can also be Xyz Summoned using a “<strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>” as material, transferring its material to it. If your LP are 1000 or lower, you can detach 1 material from this card to make it gain 500 ATK until the end of the turn; if you do, 1 monster your opponent controls lose 1000 ATK until the end of the turn. This effect is not once per turn, and it doesn’t target. If you get really low on LP or you’re deep into the grind game, it can net some heavy damage; but is mainly used for Xyz climbing using his Summoning Condition to prepare a bigger Xyz Summon.  <strong>*Number S39: Utopia Prime</strong>: I will not detail much about it, since is another “Utopia” monster that can be Xyz Summon using “Number 39: Utopia” as the full material; and is mostly used for Xyz Climbing.  <strong>*Leo Utopia Ray</strong>: This one comes from the <strong>Animation Chronicle Volume 1</strong> set, which will bring cards exclusive to the anime and adapt them to the physical game. Is a Rank 5 LIGHT Warrior that requires 3 Level 5 monsters and is always treated as “<strong>Number 39: Utopia Ray</strong>”. You can detach 1 material to equip 1 “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster from the Deck or Extra Deck to this card as it was equipped by their effect (this is because some of the “ZW -” monsters only work when equipped by their own effects and not equipped by other means, like with <strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict</strong> or <strong>Immortal Phoenix Gearfried’s</strong> effects since they were intended to work only with <strong>“Utopia”</strong> monsters). As a Quick Effect, and if this card is equipped with a “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster, you can target 1 Effect monster your opponent controls; it negates its effects and halves its current ATK. If equipped with Pegasus, it can give you a double monster effect negation and the ATK reduction can help you out with an OTK, which Utopia decks can pull off a lot.  (IMPORTANT NOTE: This wording means you can’t run 3 copies of this monster and any copies of the original <strong>Utopia Ray</strong> or the other monster that is also treated as “<strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong>”, that being <strong>Ultimate Dragonic Utopia Ray</strong>. So, pick wisely your ratios. I put 1 original and 1 Leo, but the choice to play them are yours.)  <strong>*Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</strong>: You might be familiar with this card because of how often is played in decks that uses a lot of Level 4 monsters in order to have a strong beater to run over problematic boss monsters, alongside <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. Is a Rank 5 LIGHT Warrior that requires 3 Level 5 LIGHT monsters or it can also be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 4 “<strong>Utopia</strong>” monster, transferring its materials to it; but itself cannot be used for an Xyz Summon (so no <strong>AA-ZEUS</strong> cheese). If it battles, your opponent cannot activate cards or effects until the end of the Damage Step. During damage calculation, as a Quick Effect but only if it has a “<strong>Utopia</strong>” Xyz monster as material, you can detach 2 materials to make this card’s ATK 5000 during that damage calculation. Is a rather problematic beater, for your opponent that is, that it can be equipped with the “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monster to give it an ATK boost when he runs out of materials. Consider it a Plan B boss monster.  <strong>**Number 99: Utopia Dragner</strong>: But now is time to talk about this deck’s Big Kahuna. <strong>Number 99: Utopia Dragner</strong> is a massive Rank 12 LIGHT Warrior with 3000 ATK/DEF that requires 3 or more Level 12 monsters (only an absolute madman would try to summon him by the generic way, so this is your main target with <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>). As a Quick Effect: You can detach 2 materials to Special Summon 1 “<strong>Number</strong>” monster from your Extra Deck, that has a number between “1” and “100” in its card text, and <u>it is treated as an Xyz Summon</u>. But if you do, you can only Special Summon Xyz monsters from the Extra Deck, and other monsters other that <strong>Utopia Dragner</strong> cannot attack directly this turn. Also, if an opponent’s monster declares an attack, as a hard OPT, you can change its ATK to 0. Although his last effect is pretty strong, giving a defensive option in battle, the real busted thing about this new boss monster is his first effect. If summoned with the right combo (which I list a bit below), it is possible to summon him with 4 materials, granting you access during your turn and your opponents turn to the non-“<strong>Utopia</strong>” Number monsters in the Extra Deck; those being <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> (Summon it during your turn for Spell Negation, but if you have Hyper RUM in the GY, DO NOT give it to him and save it for later) and Number 92: <strong>Heart-eartH Dragon</strong> (Summon it during your opponent’s turn, especially during the End Phase, and when you do GIVE HIM the Hyper RUM from the GY so it can banish its entire field). Just as an extra, to showcase which could be good targets for <strong>Dragner</strong>’s effect, here’s a list of Number monsters that could benefit from it: <ul>  	<li><strong>Number 3: Cicada King.</strong> Monster effect negation and large blocker.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 4: Stealth Kragen.</strong> Quick Effect monster destruction and burn.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 6: Chronomaly Atlantis.</strong> Can become a large beater and could halve your opponent’s LP at cost of a Battle Phase.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 7: Lucky Straight.</strong> While its effect relies only on luck, its effects can be devastating.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 9: Heraldic King Genom-Heritage.</strong> Useful against Xyz-centered Decks.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 11: Big Eye.</strong> Takes control of 1 of your opponent’s monsters.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 14: Greedy Sarameya.</strong> Bounces back any burn damage you would take, and could possibly destroy a lot of monsters with its second effect. Useful against Burn Decks.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 18: Heraldry Patriarch.</strong> Useful against decks that Summon multiple copies of a monster.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 21: Frozen Lady Justice.</strong> Destroys all Defense Position monsters your opponent controls.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 22: Zombiestein.</strong> Ridiculously large ATK value and RDA Abyss-like omni-negate.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld.</strong> Direct attacker, monster destroyer and provides mandatory backrow negation, including your own so be careful.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 24: Dragulas the Vampiric Dragon.</strong> Can be brought back if not destroyed properly and can send cards from the field to the GY without targeting.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 25: Force Focus.</strong> Monster effect negation against high-level monsters. Useful against Ritual, Fusion or Synchro-based strategies.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid.</strong> If its effect is successful, it can turn into a rather large monster, usually a <strong>Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech</strong>. Useful against boosted monsters, like a <strong>Gren Maju Da Eiza</strong>-centered Deck.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula</strong>. Stat boost to your entire field if you have an LP advantage, as well as a possible monster board wipe. It can be used to summon <strong>Seven Sins</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark</strong>. Stat reduction to your opponent’s field and monster reviver upon being destroyed.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong>. Spell negation and attack interceptor.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir</strong>. Defensive and stalling option.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</strong>. Entire lockdown of 1 card on the field while he stays on the field.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 54: Lion Heart.</strong> Battle damage reflector.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 60: Dugares the Timeless </strong>(requires <strong>Zexal Field</strong>). All of his effects are amazing.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 61: Volcasaurus</strong>. Monster destruction and burn.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon.</strong> Massive ATK values when the field is packed with Xyz monsters.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu.</strong> With a proper setup, he can Summon a really beefy token.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 68: Sanaphond the Sky Prison.</strong> Prevents players to Special Summon from the GY.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 70: Malevolent Sin. </strong>Banishes 1 monster for a turn. If kept alive and constantly attacking, it can become a large beater and could be used to Summon <strong>Seven Sins.</strong></li>  	<li><strong>Number 71: Rebarian Shark</strong>. “<strong>Number</strong>” Xyz monster reviver and can setup a “<strong>Rank-Up-Magic</strong>” for the next turn.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 76: Harmonizer Gradielle</strong>. Steals monsters from the opponent’s GY while gaining kind of specific protection.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 77: The Seven Sins</strong> (requires <strong>Zexal Field</strong>). Banishes all Special Summoned monsters from the opponent’s field and attaches 1 of them, while also gaining protection.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora</strong>. Can make 1 card on the field unaffected to all card effects, and it can be used as material for a <strong>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 84: Pain Gainer</strong>. Massive DEF values when more Xyz monsters are on the field, burns your opponent each time they activate backrow, destroys all of his monsters with less DEF than him and it can be used to Summon Seven Sins.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker</strong>. Constant card banishing.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon</strong>. Banishes any card Normal Summmoned, Special Summoned or Set from your opponent’s field at their End Phase.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 97: Dragluon</strong>. It can Summon a <strong>Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</strong> with a <strong>Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</strong> as material OR a <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong>. By any route, this is an OTK enabler.</li>  	<li><strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong>. OTK enabler when packed with more Xyz monsters.</li> </ul> As for the said combo, it mostly relies that you have a <strong>ZS – Ascended Sage</strong> on your hand and another Level 4 monster. Use both to summon <strong>Number 39: Utopia Double</strong>, and use <strong>Ascended Sage</strong>’s effect to search <strong>Hyper RUM</strong>. Then use Double’s effect to add the <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> from the Deck to then Special Summon a <strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>. Use that Utopia to summon either <strong>Utopia Prime</strong> or <strong>Utopia Ray</strong>, and then use the <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> to summon <strong>Utopia Dragner</strong>. Use <strong>Dragner</strong>’s effect to summon <strong>Number 38</strong> during your turn and don’t activate the <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> from the GY yet. Keep doing your plays like normal. When your opponent turn starts, you can use <strong>Dragner</strong>’s effect again to bring <strong>Number 92</strong>; but it is recommended to save it until the End Phase or if <strong>Dragner</strong> is in risk to getting removed from the field by any means. If you do summon <strong>Number 92</strong>, activate the <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> from the GY and attach it to him. When the End Phase rolls up, activate its effect to banish most of your opponent’s field to have a rather secure OTK on your following turn.  <strong>Side Deck and Generic Cards</strong>  As for the more generic cards run in the Deck, <strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> can search any monster from the Main Deck except the “<strong>ZW -</strong>” monsters, <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> for recycling monsters, <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> for <strong>Utopia Double</strong>’s requirements and a <strong>Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops</strong> as a Plan C boss monster and Xyz Monster reviver.  The Side Deck consists mostly of cards I think would synergize well with the Deck. More Main Deck monster options for more swarming (<strong>Dododo Buster</strong>, <strong>Gogogo Giant </strong>and <strong>Astral Kuriboh</strong>), Xyz Monsters (<strong>Number 99: Utopic Dragon, ZW – Leo Arms, Gagagaga Magician</strong> with both <strong>Number F0</strong>, <strong>Daigusto Emeral</strong> and a <strong>Number 97: Dragluon</strong> package) and some backrow (<strong>Dodododraw</strong> for more draws and <strong>Gagagarevenge</strong> for monster reviving).  &nbsp;  And that should be enough for this deck’s analysis. For the time I practiced this deck, the biggest board I could manage was 5 negates (<strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong> with <strong>Eagle Claw</strong> equipped, <strong>Dragner </strong>with <strong>Pegasus Twin Saber</strong> equipped, <strong>Number 38</strong> on the field, and a set <strong>Numbers Protect</strong>) alongside a <strong>Utopia the Lightning</strong>, <strong>Heart-earth Dragon</strong> with <strong>Hyper RUM</strong> as material, <strong>ZW – Lightning Blade</strong> equipped to <strong>Dragner</strong> and one <strong>ZS – Utopic Sage</strong> in the GY for extra protection. And I required the best opening hand possible, which was opening with both <strong>Ascended Sage</strong> and <strong>Armed Sage</strong>, and a <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong>; doing the <strong>Utopia Double</strong> triple search combo.  If you could manage a bigger board of negates, let me now in the comments. Lastly, thanks for reading this wall of text, probably the biggest for now. The decklist for the <strong>Starter Deck: Kaiba</strong> deck will be uploaded tomorrow. Until then.  <strong>Decklist</strong>  <strong>Monsters (19):</strong>  1x ZW – Eagle Claw  1x ZW – Tornado Bringer  1x ZW – Lightning Blade  1x ZW – Pegasus Twin Saber  3x Zubababancho Gagagacoat  3x Utopic Onomatopoeia  1x ZW – Asura Strike  2x ZS – Ascended Sage  2x ZS – Armed Sage  3x Dodododwarf Gogogoglove  1x Utopic Astral Hope  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells (18):</strong>  2x Onomatopaira  1x Reinforcements of the Army  1x Shining Draw  2x Rank-Up-Magic Zexal Force  2x Zexal Construct  2x Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force  1x Monster Reborn  1x Double or Nothing!  3x Xyz Change Tactics  2x Onomatopickup  1x Zexal Field  &nbsp;  <strong>Traps (3):</strong>  3x Numbers Protect  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck (15):</strong>  2x Number 99: Utopia Dragner  1x Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon  1x Number 38: Hoper Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy  1x ZW – Dragonic Halberd  1x Number S39: Utopia the Lightning  1x Leo Utopia Ray  1x Number S39: Utopia Prime  1x Number C39: Utopia Ray  1x Number 39: Utopia  2x ZS – Utopic Sage  1x Number 39: Utopic Double  1x Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops"

Maybe even with protection!,"Good for going first or second, slightly better going second though IMO.  Nearly every starting hand you should be able to get both <a data-name=""Wightprince"">Wightprince </a>into the graveyard by using either of <a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>'s efffects: discarding if you drew Prince with first effect or sending with second effect; summoning Dark Grepher and activating his effect; or summoning Armageddon Knight.  Foolish Burial and One for One are also options.  If you don't start with any of those somehow you've also got the three Lightning Storms and Super Poly's, Prince and <a data-name=""Wightbaking"">Wightbaking</a> can activate off both of their discards as they are worded with ""if"" and not ""when"".  More ways to turbo Prince or Baking into the grave are to just link them off with Linkuriboh or Almiraj.  My strat is to send a Baking to grave first with any of the methods I mentioned, searching Prince and <a data-name=""Wightmare"">Wightmare</a>, then discarding Prince.  Activate Prince in grave sending the vanilla and Lady, activate again banishing the three to summon King from deck, then activate Mare to summon Lady for effect protection.  King should be at 3k after this and possibly more depending on what you hand was, like if you drew into Princess.  In the chance you don't open into any Skull Servants another play is to just Zombie World and Super Poly into <a data-name=""Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon"">Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon</a> or Starving Venom.  Extra Deck is the Dragonecro and two Starving Venoms for the shenanigans I just mentioned, two <a data-name=""Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn"">Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn</a> and a <a data-name=""Sylvan Princessprite"">Sylvan Princessprite</a> for milling.  Doesn't come up very often but the tech is viable.  <a data-name=""Avendread Savior"">Avendread Savior</a> to for more graveyard sending and maybe beat over something.  I don't use it a whole lot but, again, there if needed.  <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a> for draw power, <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a> for potential OTK set ups if you King is the size of a, really big scary skeleton.  And finally Linkuriboh and Almiraj for linking away Prince or Baking if you had bad opening draw.  Side deck has two Ghost Belles to counter things like Called by the Grave because we want those skellies in the grave.  Two Book of Life for revival and graveyard removal.  Lightning Storm for if you want more backrow removal.  Now that I think about it Twin Twisters would be an equally good option, good idea for budget play.  Shiranui Style Solemnity...I'll be honest I've never understood how to properly use this with the deck, I've only seen it being run in other Skull Servant decks so I figured I might as well put it in the side.  Veil of Darkness because nearly all of the Skull Servants are darks and if you believe in the heart of the cards you'll put all of them in the graveyard during your draw phase.  Torrential Tribute for interruption.  The Extra Deck monsters in the side you could replace with other cards if you like, I've haven't really been able to find good plays with them.  Up to you if you want.  Have fun with the biggest walking beat stick known to skeleton kind!"

Their old strategy was about battle position and ranking-up their Xyz Monsters. Nowadays, they're more of a monster spam with no reason, or linking and doing nothing, which is why they're not used. <ul>  	<li>Main Strategy: Going first or second probably won't change your moves. This deck is all about Special Summoning their Rank 7 and hoping to live a turn.</li>  	<li>Monsters: <ul>  	<li>Level 3: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Digital Bug Registrider"">Digital Bug Registrider</a>: Probably the best card in DigiBug deck. It's the card that make your Rank 7 more accessible and faster. His 1st effect can be triggered by most of the deck and his second eff is also good if you get lucky.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Digital Bug Websolder"">Digital Bug Websolder</a>: Main monster for a Normal Summon. Websolder is good in basically any hand opening(except if you're like me and draws 20 traps in a deck with only 3). His effect makes you summon 1 from your hand, which with Beetroopers, that could mean more Extra Deck monsters.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Scout Buggy"">Beetrooper Scout Buggy</a>: Best Beetrooper monster, no doubt. Splashable monster that's a free Xyz/Link Summon. If used right, it can make big combos.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Scale Bomber"">Beetrooper Scale Bomber</a>: Registrider, but not Registrider. Scale Bomber is pratically another Registrider, having the same impact - Special Summon a second monster by Normal Summoning a card.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker"">Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker</a>: Do I need to say something about it...? It's a free special summon, no matter your hand. If any of your monsters got negated, you still have a free summon.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a>: While being heavily used in other insect decks, in DigiBug we have a big problem. We're out of Lv4 monsters. You can Resonance Insect, but it's too bricky in a deck where you always want a Lv3 monster, not a Lv4 one.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Non-Level 3: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Danger! Mothman!"">Danger! Mothman!</a>: Basically the best draw maker for the deck. Your luck doesn't matter that much, since in any case, you'll get a draw. You can use him for links or some Bagooska action.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Sting Lancer"">Beetrooper Sting Lancer</a>: Not as good as Mothman, but it still adds the Beetrooper Field Spell, which can give you a Lv3 monster or it can add the Beetrooper trap, which is also good negation.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Battlewasp - Sting the Poison"">Battlewasp - Sting the Poison</a>: Well, some people may ask why I added this card into the deck, since it's not really a combo starter(because I didn't put any synchros) and the add(Twinbow the Attacker) will not make much difference. Well, I added it for the negation effect. You can easily summon this card with Cicada King and it's just another interruption for your opponent.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Spells: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: Since you brick a lot, desires is just a last hope.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Bug Signal"">Bug Signal</a>: This card is basically a Rank-Up-Magic. It can speed-up the summon of the Digital Bug Rhinosebus(The rank 7 monster).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>/<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>/<a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a>: They're there to fill the deck. Foolish Burial can be used as a combo starter sometimes(using Gokipole), but it's too situational and most of the times it'll just be a bait for your opponent. The other cards are just a try to have more monsters.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Traps: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Bug Emergency"">Bug Emergency</a>: Use this to protect yourself/have some monsters. It is a brick sometimes, so if you want to change it, go for it.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Beetrooper Fly &amp; Sting"">Beetrooper Fly &amp; Sting</a>: Counter trap that sets itself. Depending on the field, this can be a life saver.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Extra Deck: <ul>  	<li>Go mostly for the Xyz Monsters, but the Beetrooper links are also very good and Inzektor Picofalena can add good cards, if used well.</li>  	<li>Most of the cards can be changed in the Extra Deck, but 2 of the DigiBugs Xyzs is good to mantain.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> DigiBugs are a really fun deck to play, but they can brick a lot and handtraps are always a problem. Anything you want to say, comment it, since it's good for me to learn about the deck too."

However, this time I did this deck just for the heck of it. <strong>Starter Deck: Kaiba</strong> and <strong>Started Deck: Yugi</strong> where printed all the way back in 2002 and didn't followed the usual 40-something Main Deck in other to give the first ever players of Yu-Gi-Oh! a starting point to learn to play. With that said, the age in some of this cards is very noted since this Starter Deck featured a lot of Normal monsters.  What I will say is what 2 decks will be on the chopping block: Since I did the Starter Deck: Kaiba just for fun and to mark another one in the list, a version for <strong>Starter Deck: Yugi</strong> will come later, alongside the <strong>Shaddoll Showdown Structure Deck</strong>, which featured the new wave of <strong>Shaddoll</strong> support."

Bless Madame Verre.","Based on the deck shown by u/KharAznable on his post about cheap decks under 30$. The deck revolves mostly around using the Witchcrafter engine to get out Madame Verre and protecting it using the various spell cards in the archetype as discard fodder for your Witchcrafters or using their effects to assist your plays. The main differences in my deck from the original are the addition of the field spell Secret Village of the Spellcasters, which locks out your opponent from using Spell Cards as long as you maintain a Spellcaster on the field, and Effect Veilers as generic budget hand traps.  General game plan: You want to go turn one and set up a board with as many Witchcrafters in the grave (or banished after using their effects) as possible, at least a few spells in the hand with Golem Aruru, and Madame Verre and Witchcrafter Bystreet on the field. If you have Haine and Unveiling you could set Unveiling and immediately summon Haine during Standby to protect Madame Verre and your Spellcasters for turn two as well. Dogmatika Punishment or Golem Aruru any big beat sticks your opponent may pull out, and utilize Madame Verre's opponent field-wide monster negate (non-targeting BTW) and Aruru and Haine to weather your opponent's turn. Your turn, if you still have an Aruru you can generally utilize a Collaboration and Scroll for advantage alongside Madame Verre's ATK boost effect during Damage Step to swing over bigger monsters for huge damage.  I honestly love this deck so far, and you can still spill in other Extra Deck monsters as you see fit. Very fun casual control deck, in my opinion, spell lolis for the win!  &nbsp;"

The BAs should be used first turn because your s/t-zone will be blocked afterwards.  Therefore, only the BAs with good effects are included.  The Dark Spirits are searchable via Rhino, Tour Guide and Scarm and can revive the necrofears and the unchained monster.  Beatrice/Herold are light fairys for Norleras.

The deck is focused in summoning Destiny Hero - Plasma while D - Force is on the field, but, to get that D - Force out the deck it's not simple so i've made a more consistent version of the previous deck.  This new version have less cards consequently having less Danger! cards with means less monsters for plasma to absorb, but until you summon plasma probably is the 4-6 turn so the enemy should have did a plenty of things and got a lot of monsters in his graveyard so don't worry.  Hmmm there's no WomboCombo, just stall until you have all cards you need to summon Plasma.  &nbsp;  Notes: <ul>  	<li>Destiny Hero - Plasma IS a special summon which needs tributes so it's NOT tribute summon what means that you can tribute 3 Scapegoat tokens for his summon.</li>  	<li>You can trade Dark World Dealings for Hand Destruction but remember that Hand Destruction don't trigger Danger! or any discard effects.</li>  	<li>Is easily disrupted by Lock Bird and Ash Blossom so you can add mind drain or prohibition to the side deck.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.

More than often your opponent doesn't have an out for Crooked Cook and ends up overcommitting thus making the Fisherman LV7's banish effect all the sweeter. If you're not satisfied with that, you can just straight up boardwipe with a Zeus summoned on top of a Cook that can't be destroyed by battle. This is assuming Crook has Right-Hand Shark as material.  The sharks are meant to summon the XYZ's. The Icejades are surprisingly very useful here.  Tremolat lets you special summon ANY water monster from your hand. Fisherman LV5, Buzzsaw Shark, Citadel Whale, Beautunaful Princess are all good options. Tinola lets you special summon ANY water monster from the graveyard, which is pretty good considering the cards we're running. It's, also, possible to summon a WATER monster sent from your hand by it's effect if there's a water monster in the grave already.  Side-deck is interchangeable depending if you go first or second.  Missing card is Ice Barrier, a tremendous searcher for the Fisherman boys, Tremolat, and Citadel Whale if you want it.

Your main opener is a Halqifibrax combo: Keep in mind that Zefraxi turns any 'Zefra' monster on board into a tuner if it's Pendulum Summoned. <ol>  	<li>Get a monster and a tuner on board, and only those 2 monsters. Resist the urge to pendulum summon everything out of hand. If you're desperate, the handtraps are tuners.</li>  	<li>Summon <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax</strong>, activate its trigger effect to summon <strong>Deskbot 001</strong> from deck.</li>  	<li>Link for <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Auroradon</strong>, summon 3 tokens, then summon 001 from GY.</li>  	<li>Using a token and 001, summon <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>.</li>  	<li>Using Auroradon's 2nd effect, tribute 2 tokens to summon <strong>Mecha-Phantom Beast Coltwing</strong>. Coltwing effect for 2 tokens, and summon 001 from GY again.</li>  	<li>001 and token to summon <strong>Cupid Pitch</strong>, choose to <span><strong>increase</strong></span> level.</li>  	<li>Level 5 Cupid Pitch and token for <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>, equip Halq. Use Cupid Pitch's effect to search <strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong>.</li> </ol> During your Opponent's turn, you can use Hop Ear in order to Synchro Summon for <strong>Metaphys Horus</strong> for an additional negate. Keep in mind that Metaphys Horus' negate is an on-summon trigger, <strong>so it will not go on the same chain.</strong>  In the case that 001 is negated by either Ghost Belle or Skull Meister after Auroradon summons 3 tokens, <strong>you can either</strong>: use Auroradon to tribute 2 tokens and summon Coltwing, and summon the 001. From here, you make Cupid Pitch and do the standard combo to make a Borrelsavage. Then, you can use the Hop Ear you searched to summon <strong>Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</strong> at the start of your Opponent's MP1 using Hop Ear and Coltwing.  <strong>OR</strong>: Choose to reduce the level of Cupid Pitch, and then synchro summon Ravenous Crocodragon with 3 materials to draw 2 cards. Then use Hop Ear to make Horus during Opponent's turn.  The above combo described actually has absolutely <strong>NOTHING</strong> to do with Zefra. It is deadup a generic Halqifibrax combo. You can probably use it in anything you damn well please.  <span><strong>Some questionable decisions</strong>: </span>  <strong>Fusion Destiny</strong>: The new Destroy Phoenix Enforcer is one hell of a crutch. Alternatively, you can run the Dragoon + Verte package, which is still more potent than D.P.E., but people are more prone to immediately scoop upon Dragoon than Phoenix Enforcer.  <strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong>: This card is literally a brick in 90% of situations. It is a free search off Herald of Arc Light if the Halq combo goes through, but in all honesty, it is best to remove it. Of all the games I have played where Unicore ended up in hand, it ended up as discard fodder every single time.  <strong>Crossout Designator</strong>: Halq combo immediately dies to handtraps. Less so to Ghost Belle and Meister, but definitely gets rolled by Ash, Imperm, Veiler, Nibiru and Gamma. The random mash of handtraps can come in handy going 2nd too, the ratios are yours to screw around with.  <strong>Zefra Metaltron</strong>: He is only here because he's the Zefra link and he looks cool. There is probably something better to run than this horrible thing.  <strong>Actual Zefra Stuff.</strong>  Your best card in the deck is <strong>Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing</strong>. He quite literally searches your entire deck on Pendulum Summon or destruction while in a monster zone. If you can't go into any crazy combo, and can only summon a Zefrainu, the move is to search <strong>Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing </strong>off Zefraniu. This allows you to search another card during your Opponent's turn when Nine Pillars destroys Zefraniu. From there, you can set up for next turn, or search for <strong>Zefra War</strong>, which activates from hand if you have 2 Zefras on scale. If possible, destroy your Field Spell with Zefra War. If you have <strong>Zefra Providence</strong> in your GY, then feel free to target your own scale and protect it if you don't have the field spell. Or just straight up blow up your scale if you're that desperate.  <strong>Zefraath</strong> is exclusively a scale. His effect is <em><strong>dogshit useless</strong></em>. He tributes your ENTIRE BOARD from the E/D, so he summons himself into the Extra Monster Zone. If you haven't noticed yet, that renders his second effect to allow a second Pendulum Summon that turn entirely null and void. Yeah. Master Rule 4 has not been kind to Pendulums. If it's any consolation, Zefraath is probably your best scale, and you always want Zefraath on one of the scales.  Yeah, that's about it. If you have any advice, please do tell. With Electrumite in jail, Pendulums are in a sad, sad, desperate state. Please send help."

(I got inspired by the brave tokken prank kids list which won an 52 player event and went 8-0.)</span>  <span>This version of d-link uses the ""Brave Tokken"" archetype which gets released in the Grand Creators as a 1 card omni negate engine. </span>  <span>You basically use the Aquamancer to get ""Rite of Aramesia"", which will give you an ""Brave Tokken"" and the countinous Spell ""Jpurney of Destiny"", this will search the ""Wandering Gryphon Rider"" and if you summon a monster you can add the ""Dracoback the Dragon Steed"" to your hand. </span>  <span>This are basically a free omni negate and a free discard which also can chain block. Gryphons summon is a quick effect, so you can actually activate something like chaos space and chain gryphon to it. And Dracoback has a gy effect which triggers if it gets discarded, let's say by a dragon ravine, so you can discard it for ravine and send absorouter and then you can chain block the absorouter. This allows d-link to play even better through handtraps and the only downsides are that you can't activate the on field effects of a normal summoned monster (Seyvert and Chamber) and you only have 3 monster zones you can play with, which sounds like a good pay off to me. And you can play around the first restriction by just using stuff like world legacy guardragon or pisty to get the normal summoned monsters back. </span>  <span>Oh and there is even more, you can actually use the tokken as synchro/link material, so if you need one you can just use the tokken (which is a level 4 btw).</span>"

Mezuki and Pyramid Turtle do just fine. </span>  <span><strong>Get Endless Decay out as soon as possible, best if they have 8000 LP.</strong> Since it takes half of your opponent's LP as its ATK, you really need to rush Endless Decay. It isn't too much of a problem, but still- there have been times when I didn't have a solid win condition because I couldn't get it out fast enough.</span>  <span>I sideboarded Nobleman of Crossout because it was a decent enough card to keep but not always the best draw to have and Hand Destruction for the discard and draw 2. Twin Twisters would probably be better than MST, but for the sake of Zombie Madness I wanted to keep it as close to the original deck (and as close to the original <em>idea</em></span><span> of the deck- getting huge beatsticks for massive damage) as possible.</span>  <span>The Extra Deck could use some work, but for now it works. If you have any suggestions, let me know! </span>"

The main searcher is gazelle, he can send spinny, jaguar, mole, falco, foxy, etc... to the gy, and then you can trigger its effect on the gy, reviving it with will or monster reborn, or if it is a spell/trap you can add it with wolf. The searchers are lady debug, foxy, cynet mining, circle and sunlight wolf. The extra summon cards from the hand are salamangreat mole, bison, mathmech addition, fowl, gazelle and spinny, the summoner cards are monster reborn, will, miragestallio, and splash mage. The main distruptions are pyro phoenix, rage, ash and roar. If you watched closely you probably seen that splash mage is a WATER attribute so he can't be material for the other salamangreats BUT due to its revival effect you can easely got the violet chimera materials (and also you can use it for accesscode(and yeah, jammer is here for accesscode too)).

This deck can also otk as well as blow up lots of your opponents pieces very quickly  This deck was inspired by a list that felt really weak but was still fun to play, this just adds some more combos and possibilities.  Main combo  Turn 1:link climb to link 4 with the twins, pass (if you used exceed make the elephant first). On opponents turn (preferably at their end step), use the link 4's effect to split into the twin links, getting a destroy and draw in the process. Move to your turn, play a monster (any hand trap will do), link into unicorn with 1 of the link 2s and the monster (preferably the one that draws), spin an opponents card if you want, use the other link's effect to special summon the one you linked off back. Use the Unicorn and the link who was not used to special summon yet into unchained, using the effect of the other link on the field to bring back the link 2 from the grave (if you chose the one that pops on enter, you will get an additional pop with unchained). use the 2 links to go into the link 4. Battle phase, attack with the 2 link 4s, use the quick effect to split into 2 link 2s, attack for game.  In the span of your opponents turn to yours, you get 3 pops, 2 draws, 1 spin, not counting any other plays you might do.  Dragoon is in here for support going first if you dont want to leave your board without a negate."

It’s pretty standard for the most part, so I'll explain some of my card choices. The reason i don't play miracle rupture and revival golem and all that is because my luck is bad, and i'll take a more consistent deck over a free level 4 every once in a while any day. You can, as always, play whatever hand traps and side deck that you want. 1x Re-cover - This is a level one tuner that can be summoned easily with Crystron Halqifibrax. Use it to summon Naturia Beast which is pretty broken. Its recurrence effect isn't bad, you can use it to link climb to Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess if you need to 3x Pot of Avarice - Pretty much lets you draw two mid combo, and I nearly always activate it when I draw it. You don't really need cards to stay in your graveyard with this deck, just keep Prank-Kids Dropsies there 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - My favorite hand trap 3x Infinite Impermanence - My second favorite hand trap (better than effect veiler, fight me) 1x Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity - A zexal that you can summon on your opponent’s turn pretty easily. All you need to end on is Crystron Halqifibrax, a level 2 Adamancipator, and Borreload Savage Dragon. Just make sure it doesn’t miss timing 1x Formula Synchron - You can summon this with Crystron Halqifibrax on your opponent’s turn, and then synchro summon Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity. It also gives you a draw 1x Borrelsword Dragon - Good for otk’s, which this deck struggles a bit with. Pretty easy to summon, too 1x Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior - Dragoon removal, pretty much 1x Naturia Barkion - It's in the side deck, but this card destroys trap decks.

It means we cannot use Lonfire or Rescue Rabbit, but we still have 10 Loci anyway (3 Loci, 3 Unexpected Dai, 3 Painful Choice, 1 One for One). Brave Token engine also uses 2 main monster zones, so the combo is tailored to only use the remaining zones. Watch the combo in the video down below, all we need is <strong>Loci+discard</strong> and to make it Nibiru proof we need 1 Brave Token starters (3 Aramesia, 3 Aquamancer, 1 Foolish Burial).

I originally planned on running a Cyber Angel Drytron decklist but after testing some hands I realized I bricked <b>a lot</b>. So I ditched the idea and went for Pure Cyber Angel. My reasons for the ratios of the cards is as follows:  1 ofs: Cyber Prima - A potential full-on destruction of all Spells on the field. Ritual Sanctuary - I just found that this card wasn't the greatest while being played at 2 or 3 but I do run 3 copies of a card that can search it, otherwise, I would've just removed it. Cyber Angel Benten - I would play more but Drytron got it limited, this card if ever brought back to 3 is certainly worth playing at 3.  2 ofs: Etoile Cyber - Just Playing it as tribute fodder. Cyber Angel Nashata - Let's me take control of a monster my opponent controls after it's been sent to the GY when it been properly Summoned.  3 ofs: Cyber Tutabon - Lets me grab a Ritual Spell when tributed so it's just there for the recycling.  Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring - Average hand trap used in most decks.  Cyber Petit Angel - On Summon lets me grab a Machine Angel Ritual or Cyber Angel depending on what I need.  Cyber Egg Angel - Lets me add a Ritual Sanctuary or Machine Angel Spell from my Deck to my hand.  Cyber Angel Vrash - The major Wincon of the Deck, lets me pop all monsters opponent controls Special Summoned from the Extra Deck plus gains an extra Attack as well as having a pop negate.  Cyber Angel Dakini - On Summon forces your opponent to send a monster to their GY, has a recycling effect, and can make all Rituals inflict piercing battle damage.  Cyber Angel Izana - Forces your opponent to send a monster they control to the GY, lets me attack again when it destroys a monster by battle, Has a built-in pop when the opponent targets a Cyber Angel.  Cyber Angel Idaten - Lets me give all my Ritual monsters an extra 1000 in stats when tributed.

Otherworld Hero and a Dragon Monk take an epic journey!","The converging journeys of an otherworldly hero and dragon monk join together to form a surprisingly competent deck! Brave Token and Tenyi are archetypes focused on supporting their respective normal monsters. Combined together, Brave Token provides 7 copies of Called by the Grave to ensure that Tenyis can actually play through interruption like Ash, Impermanence and Nibiru! Simultaneously, Brave Token gets the firepower and support it desperate lacks as it pumps out big beatsticks like Tenyi Spirit Sahasrara and Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. The Tenyi toolbox can also be used like a targeted bounce from Tenyi Spirit Vishuda and +2 draw/protection from Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi! As both archetypes are deployed to the field, these archetypes cover each other’s weaknesses and in turn strengthen each other forming one deck of beautiful synergy.  Tenyi’s arch nemesis are handtraps – they are generally unable to play through Nibiru (since they summon 10+ times during their main combo and cannot recover if field wiped) or when their chokepoint, Shaman of the Tenyi is negated.  With the introduction of the <strong><span>BRAVE TOKEN PACKAGE</span>,</strong> Tenyis are more resilient playing through handtraps since Brave Token functions as 7 extra copies of “Called by the Grave.” Wandering Gryphon Rider provides an omni-negate before the 5th summon, allowing the Tenyi player to play through Nibiru. This combo is accessible if you have Aquamancer of the Sanctuary, Foolish Burial (target is Aquamancer, banish it from the GY to get Rite of Aramesia), or Rite of Aramesia in hand, since they allow the summon of Wandering Gryphon Rider (the omni-negate). If you open Aquamancer/Aramesia, you only summon twice, including the Gryphon.  The <span><strong>MAIN COMBO</strong></span> of the deck requires Rite of Aramesia, Vessel for the Dragon Cycle and any Tenyi: <ol>  	<li>Activate Rite of Aramesia. SS Brave Token, place Journey of Destiny from deck to field. (This is good ash bait. If they ash it, then you can continue your Tenyi combo).</li>  	<li>Special summon any Tenyi, then link summon Monk of the Tenyi.</li>  	<li>Journey of Destiny adds Dracoback from deck to your hand when you summoned.</li>  	<li>Activate Vessel of Dragon Cycle, dump Mare Mare into the GY and search for Tenyi Spirit, Ashuna (this is the best Tenyi for comboing since it’s an extender).</li>  	<li>SS Ashuna.</li>  	<li>Activate Journey's effect, adding Gryphon to your hand while discarding the Dracoback equip.</li>  	<li>Activate Dracoback equip GY effect, equip it to Brave Token.</li>  	<li>SS Gryphon. This is the end of your Brave Token Combo. The rest is standard Tenyi combo. (This is the 5th If your opponent uses Nibiru, you can negate it).</li>  	<li>Link summon Shaman of the Tenyi using Monk + Ashuna.</li>  	<li>SS from GY Mare Mare with Shaman of the Tenyi, then discard any card (preferably a Tenyi card since they activate in the GY.) This is the most crucial chokepoint of the deck, now protected by the Brave Token Package!</li>  	<li>SS Mare Mare tokens thrice with it’s effect. Link summon Linkriboh with a token. Then link summon using Shaman +2 tokens to make Tenyi Spirit – Sahasrara.</li>  	<li>Banish Ashuna from the GY to summon any level 4 Tenyi from deck. Synchro summon Berserker of the Tenyi (Or Baxia if you want to clear the board) using Mare Mare + Level 4 Tenyi.</li> </ol> <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/KtKh1CW"">With just three cards. your board should look like this:</a>  <img src=""https://imgur.com/a/KtKh1CW"" alt="""" />  This board can now play through negates, nibiru, handtraps. It is very consistent to make since any Tenyi could make this board, and there are 7 ways to access your Brave Token omni-negate (and the original Called By the Grave.)  Going first you have a formidable board. You have battle protection (Linkuriboh), a banish (Draco Berserker), Token Generator/Protection (Sahasrara) and an omni-negate (Wandering Gryphon Rider).  Going second you can OTK easily. You have a bounce (Dracoback the Dragon Steed), an omni-negate (Wandering Gryphon Rider), multiple targeted shuffles (Baxia) and several big bodies on board (Sahasrara). If Vishuda is in the GY, you can bounce a card on the field.  The strength of this board depend highly on drawing into Vessel of the Dragon Cycle or somehow putting milling Mare Mare into the GY (perhaps with Foolish Burial or discarding it from hand) since it’s the best revive target for Shaman of the Tenyi. Boards that are made without Mare Mare are considerably weaker, perhaps only ending on Brave Token, Wandering Gryphon Rider and the Tenyi Link-3s/or Sahasrara.  These two decks also <span><strong>SYNERGIZE</strong></span> quite well since both archetypes discard from the hand for cost for the activation of key cards like Journey of Destiny and Shaman of the Tenyi. Aquamancer of the Sanctuary and all Tenyi monsters activate by banishing from the GY. Brave Token is spashable in decks that don’t use their normal summon card effect and Tenyi doesn’t use it since all it does is special summon.  Other than the 9 card Brave Token package, the rest of this deck is fairly standard Tenyi. No explanation needed for the rest of the cards – I just wanted to showcase the power of the Brave Token package in a deck that desperately needed a way to play through hand traps.  <span><strong>General Tips</strong></span> – I’ve play tested this online quite a bit, and here is what I learned playing it. <ul>  	<li>Activating Rite of Aramesia is good ash bait. If they ash it, then you can continue your Tenyi combo. Just hope they don’t have Nibiru in hand!</li>  	<li>Don’t summon Gryphon before you have the material on board to summon Shaman of the Tenyi. Gryphon is an effect monster, which turns off all your Tenyi’s ability to SS from hand!</li>  	<li>When discarding cards, always try to discard a Aquamancer, any Tenyi monster, or Heavenly Dragon Circle since they have beneficial effects in GY.</li>  	<li>Foolish Burial goods target is Heavenly Dragon Circle, and once banished from the GY, search either for Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi or Fists of the Unrivalled Tenyi. Even though these are one-ofs, you basically have 7 copies of each card!</li>  	<li>The flex-spots in this deck are Pankratops, Feather Duster, Monster Reborn and Raigeki. You can even cut 1 Heavenly Dragon Circle and Tenyi Spirit Shthana. You can customize your deck however you like with these 6 flex-spots, whether you put in handtraps, solemns, or board breaking cards.</li>  	<li>The latter half of the Tenyi combo needs Mare Mare dumped in the GY to be summoned by Shaman of the Tenyi. If you don’t have Vessel of the Dragon Cycle in hand, you can dump it with Foolish Burial. If Mare Mare is already in your hand, then you can discard it with Shaman’s or Journey of Destiny’s effect.</li> </ul> <span><strong>Concluding Commentary</strong></span>  Inspired by the success of this package in the OCG, I thought I would experiment a little bit using Brave Token with a favourite budget deck of mine I’ve built a while ago to give it a little powerboost. The superior deck to combine with Tenyi is still Swordsoul, combining the Tenyi’s special summons and toolbox effects with Swordsoul’s offensive firepower. However, Tenyis hold a soft spot in my heart – and having them play through interruption with the power of an “isekai MC (which is basically me, the duelist)” is thematically suuuuper cool! Overall, Brave Token Tenyi is still a middling rogue deck, and it allows for Tenyi to play comfortably through the handtraps that plagued it’s combos. Don’t underestimate it’s power, it can OTK in an instant, generating 8k+ damage on board with several forms of non-destroying removal. It can also create a formidable first turn board with a combo protected by an omni-negate.  Mark my words – Brave Token is META DEFINING for combo decks. I look forward to splashing the Brave Token Package in other combo decks, not only because it’s an additional 7 copies of a better Called by the Grave – I love watching degen isekai anime trash and it’s cool I finally get to see it in Yugioh!  That’ll be it for now, GLHF Duelists!"

I've stared at black card borders for so long that I've practically forgotten what it was like back at my usual stomping grounds.  Yes, I'm talking about my earliest days in the realms of the Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game. Watching GX online, developing a probably odd affinity for one Mr. Jaden Yuki and his crazy costumed warriors, trading my Performapal/Odd-Eyes deck for a slightly modified HERO Strike Structure Deck and proceeding to tune it up into a well-oiled machine, and yelling at the top of my lungs with every Fusion and arrival of my favorite harbingers of justice.  &nbsp;  HEROes have had quite the romp over the years. Stratos had his sentence lifted, Miracle Fusion was one of the craziest and most surprisingly useful cards to make big bosses, Masked HEROes' transition from manga to physical game was second to none, Vision HEROes gave these guys the consistency and bodies on board to put them on the map, I could go on and on. But for the sake of the reader's patience and my burning desire to talk about the deck, onward I go.  &nbsp;  My affectionately named Chupi-Roe deck (which in no way involves Gunkan Suship, as much as I enjoy both sushi and roe upon it) combines multiple HEROes of origin and allegiance, as many modern HERO decks do, and gives them all home in a comfy package that aims to pop off, fuse and strike with the best of them, and just kick butt and look cool doing it. Or as one of my favorite Yugitubers TheCaliEffect [KingofGames] once said:  ""I don't care what kind of board you've got, I'm gonna break it.""  And that's precisely how I enjoy playing these bad boys. Plus a gal. Without further ado, let's break them all down. Going in order of sub-archetypes is the name of the game as always, so as to flesh out everyone's role and how they make a tiny part of a stylish and baddie-busting whole.  &nbsp; <h2>Elemental HERO</h2> Sometimes you just can't beat the originals. You won't find Flame Wingman in this list, as iconic and making me want to belt out Get Your Game On at the top of my lungs as he is. But hopefully the E's you'll find in this section will tickle your fancy nonetheless. Going from odd yet nifty Normal Monsters that produced gimmicky yet cool Fusion bosses to useful Effect Monster builders that produce... the same thing pretty much, no HERO deck can call itself complete without these darlings. <ul>  	<li>And of course, no Elemental HERO list can call itself complete without the tried and tested, lavished and loved, banned and unbanned, and stylish and soaring <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a>. He's an integral part of the team, and even though you might not want to run or see in your hand as many copies as back in the day, it's hard to imagine the deck without him. Summoning him in either fashion, no matter how many times a turn and so long as you don't miss the timing, he gives you the option of either adding a HERO of any kind from your deck to your hand to help start or support your plays, or for every HERO on your field barring himself, pop a backrow card on the field. His ATK's pretty alright for a Level 4 too, at least to me, so you might be able to pick off some lower grunts of your opponents with him. Feel free to play however much of him you prefer, but given recent times I feel two's plenty.</li>  	<li>Keeping up the trend of searching and supporting is the godsend of a manga card turned superstar in the TCG, E<a data-name=""lemental HERO Shadow Mist"">lemental HERO Shadow Mist</a>. If you send her to the GY in any fashion, she allows you to search any HERO from your deck much like our propeller-peddling friend above. But should you Special Summon her, she enables the search of something much more spicy and sure to beef up your field: the powerful and protective ""Change"" Quick-Play Spell. Though we're only playing one kind of that breed of Quickie, which we'll get to in a hot minute, this gives access to parts of your Extra Deck other archetypes DREAM of being as devastating as. Her effect is understandably a super-hard once per turn, however, so choose an effect and choose it wisely.</li>  	<li>He's not a drop in the bucket, he's Lake Superior. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier</a> was an unexpected addition in Legendary Duelists: Magical Hero, but one that certainly didn't get pelted with spoiled tomatoes either. Although he's a super-hard OPT like Shadow Mist, you'll still get plenty of use out of him. On rare occasions you'll Normal Summon him to revive a Level 4 or lower HERO from grave akin to a certain shining sentinel that'll be up next. But more often than that, you'll be fusing with him for his second effect, allowing you to draw two and pitch one. Never thought we'd see a halfway Graceful Charity in HERO, but there ya go. He's a very welcome recruit, and only needs to be at one to get the most out of him. Fingers crossed when and if Legendary Duelists: Season 3 becomes a thing, he won't set me back $60 like he currently is.</li>  	<li>This is more of a personal pick of mine, but you're free to run it as well. To think a silly tin with Jaden on the front granted me access to such a cool little Ultra Rare. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Solid Soldier"">Elemental HERO Solid Soldier</a>'s a fun extender that can enable some pretty darn interesting plays. Normal Summon him, and a Level 4 or lower HERO in your grip will follow. This can be Shadow Mist to enable her spicier searching, or Stratos to get those plays started and have another body on board for fusing with. Speaking of fusing, you'll want to do that with Solid Soldier on the field for sure, because when he's sent from the field to the GY by a Spell, he revives any HERO from GY in Defense. So now any HERO can join the party! For the most viable targets, see the previous sentence, heh.</li>  	<li>We didn't get Dark Honest localized as ""Dishonest"", but we did get one awesome little method to stave off big baddies granted to these fine fighters. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"">Elemental HERO Honest Neos</a> can come in major pinch when someone's looking to bear their claws against your buddies. As a Quickie at any point of the turn, discarding him inspires a HERO on the field with a lovely 2500 ATK, stopping those beasts dead in their tracks. Always helps to have one on standby if you can help it. You never know what big-number bearing blokes would be so brash as to bash your band of baddie busters, bucko. Ah, me and alliteration.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Rounding off the Fusion variety of Elemental HEROes is possibly my personal favorite, not just in HERO, but in possibly the entire game. I dunno why his appearance and effects speak to me. Maybe it's the idea that no matter what walk of life you're from, like these HEROes, he bands them together and shines down upon everyone to inspire and burn with radiant passion. That's right, I'm talking about <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Sunrise"">Elemental HERO Sunrise</a>. And let me tell you, he's a glue that holds all these HEROes together. Fusing him using two HEROes of differing Attributes shouldn't be too hard, you've got loads of Elementals to help with that. Once he is fused, he allows you to add the lovely Miracle Fusion to your hand to set up for a fun friend later. His second effect can be awesome, too. Once an attack's declared involving another HERO of yours, he lets you pop any card on the field. This can help with taking care of beefier foes and pesky backrow, but it also means that if your opponent DARES call a scrap with one of Sunrise's buddies, they're not getting out of it scot-free. Atop all that, he gives your monsters more power for every Attribute on your field, and when it comes to a certain Destiny HERO that'll hit the scene sometime, it can make all the difference.</li>  	<li>This is the big guy you'll be saving Miracle Fusion for. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a> is absolutely astute. Being the only omni-HERO to not specify an Elemental HERO as its primary material has its perks, which opens the floodgates for potential material to create him with. Once he hits the field, he becomes a ticking time bomb your opponent's gotta handle with caution if they wanna get out unscathed... because should they make a wrong move or force your hand, having him leave the field unleashes an automatic Raigeki upon your opponent. Say hi to the snowman from the Campbell's commercial, friendo.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Vision HERO</h2> Initially being in the manga under the control of Jaden's antithesis Aster Phoenix, these optical ooh-aah-ers are responsible for a pricey yet reliable consistency and Foolish-ing engine and plenty of extra bodies on board for you to fuse with. Don't turn your nose up at the way they look, they can really come in handy when the situation calls. <ul>  	<li>Better yet, the situation almost always calls for this guy. <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> definitely deserves another shot at pack-peddling along with the friend of his that's popping up next. Discarding a HERO lets you summon him to the field, which is great enough since it de-bricks your hand and sets up your later GY effects, but it gets better. Upon summon, Faris fetches a Vision HERO from deck to place into your backrow as a Continuous Trap. And I can already see you squiggling your eyebrows like California's seismic activity, but hear me out. The target for this effect is going to make all the difference...</li>  	<li>...so be sure to make that bullseye (or triple 20, since that gives the most points) with <a data-name=""Vision HERO Increase"">Vision HERO Increase</a>. In the backrow, he tributes a HERO of yours to take its place on field. And immediately after, he summons a Level 4 or lower Vision HERO from the deck instantly. This is starting to sound like a bit of an assembly line, funnily enough. Faris to Increase to the HERO that's been amazing for the strategy ever since initial printing---</li>  	<li>---<a data-name=""Vision HERO Vyon"">Vision HERO Vyon</a>! You'll be seeing a lot of this guy, and want to. Upon summon, he sends a HERO from your deck to the GY, enabling the aforementioned second hand thing that Faris can. But it doesn't stop there, because he also allows you to banish a HERO that's already done its job from the GY (more than likely Faris) to add the ever-iconic to GX Spell card Polymerization to your grip. By the way, which one's your favorite? The swirly blue vortex, or the two dragons going into the card?</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Apologies in advance if I bring up a certain pink-vested criminal pelter once or twice in this bullet point. But <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a> is the perfect example of extensive, brutal, and stylish beatdowns much like Mr. Pinkie's golden child. Requiring three HEROes of any kind with no further stipulations, he makes a great closer or another method to dispose of problematic monsters in a fight. On the turn you fuse him, his attack doubles to 5000, and if you feel perky and have Honest Neos give him a boost, it's a downright frightening 7500. If that doesn't make you run to your dresser to replace an article or two, this next point will: he gets three attacks every battle phase. Meaning even if your opponent's got a swarmed field of big bads or destruction-prevents one of their attacked monsters, they're still spices yet to be made and Trinity is the mortar and pestle. With all that considered, how can you not shout a certain ""M"" word verbatim as you sock your opponent's monsters like a sadistic doctor?</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Destiny HERO</h2> Normally I don't really buy into the idea of destiny and instead believe nothing's written and it's all up to those with drive and resolve to make the difference they want to see in the world (Thanks for that, Fire Emblem Awakening), but for Aster's dark and cool fellow Warriors, I'll make an exception. Besides, without them, we wouldn't get easily one of the best Spells HERO ever got, so by all means, Mr. Phoenix. Allow me to describe your darlings destined for decking doofuses deftly in daring detail. <ul>  	<li>The one you all know by heart thanks to a certain list full of certain cards under certain stipulations is <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>. If you ask me, he didn't do nothin' to nobody, but thanks to a new friend it's not necessarily much of a problem anymore. You'll definitely be binning this card through the methods of Faris, Vyon, Poly, or that enviable Spell we'll get to in due time. Just let that suspense simmer with a bay leaf and some parsley in there, then serve it with parmesan or mozzarella for a delightful dinner of a deck your dame will devour. Overly long quips aside, once in the GY, Mali can be banished to summon a copy of himself from the deck, extending your plays and setting up for more summons of big bosses. A welcome addition to the team undeniably. And with the next guy on the list, you won't be pulling your hair out at Konami's restriction decisions much longer.</li>  	<li>Come to think of it, this guy accepts things despite what his name implies. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Denier"">Destiny HERO - Denier</a> is primo GY fodder for sure. While he's chilling out there, so long as you have a Destiny HERO upon your field or grave, he can summon himself for free. This can only happen once per Duel, however, so once it's up make use of his next effect again with any number of your revival effects. Upon summon, he allows you to place any Destiny HERO from your GY or banished zone atop the deck. Remember the guy just above? Wouldn't it be nice if you could, say, not be locked to summoning him by his effect once per game without Pot of Acquisitiveness or similar effects? Then open your eyes, the wait is over!</li>  	<li>Just like our good tuxedo-clad friend above suggests, you'll surely end your opponent's destiny with the life force of all things. The unstoppable <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a> is just as blood-curdling as the day he was first printed. Special Summoning him by tributing three monsters isn't too hard considering all the extra bodies you'll be able to pull up thanks to the Vision and Destiny HEROes you'll more than likely have left over, not to mention the fun extenders the deck has on offer. Your opponent's in trouble when this garish gorer rises up, now that they're officially under a one-sided Skill Drain. If that wasn't enough, prepare to ""Ooooooooooooh~!"" like a cartoon-craving curator we know all too well, because Plasma can also dig his claws into an opponent's monster to Relinquished them and sap half their ATK for himself. You might not summon him all the time, but when he is, you're golden. In fact, he's part of the reason getting Nibiru'd barely makes me sweat with this deck, and a brand new Spell makes him all the better.</li>  	<li>This next one's a flex slot, in terms of Destiny HEROes to run and use for this and that. You could run <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"">Destiny HERO - Dynatag</a>, for example, for an odd way of Kuriboh-ing your opponent and subsequently amping up a Destiny HERO by a full stack for two turns, especially if it's a certain swiping son of a gun. Alternatively, you could run <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Decider"">Destiny HERO - Decider</a> for potential burn protection and also to retrieve a HERO from grave at the end of your turn. And I bet most will run <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Drawhand"">Destiny HERO - Drawhand</a> since he's a freebie and he, well, draws you a card. But he also gives your opponent a card, and I'm a little iffy on that. I'd rather not contribute to my opponent's hand advantage if I can help it, but don't let that stop you from running him yourself.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>Daring Destiny HEROes don't stop with orange card borders, though. Let's give them some thematically-fitting purple ones for good measure. And oh boy, in Burst of Destiny, they get a heck of a boss you're going to want to bring out as soon as possible. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroy Phoenix Enforcer</a> is an amazing ash-monger with plenty of boom and brashness to spare. Continuously, he drops the ATK of your opponent's monsters for every HERO card in the grave, but you're more than likely here for his Quickie. And boy howdy, what a Quickie it is. At any point of the turn, you can activate his effect to destroy a card you control and then another card on the field anywhere. So even if your opponent targets the winged mastermind for disruption, you can chain his effect to wreak some havoc. You're almost certain to target himself to be popped, as upon destruction, during the next Standby Phase, he revives a Destiny HERO of choice from the GY, more often than not himself because let's be honest: is an effect like that really worth only using once? I hear people are starting to run Destiny HERO - Dasher to make material for him, but ah... contrary to his name, making use of his effects is slower than molasses. So you're better off just using Malicious and Denier with Poly after searching/summoning them or with the prime card to create DPE with if you ask me. Promise, you won't notice the difference.</li>  	<li>You might not make him too much, but that's not to say he hasn't earned his place here. Reminding me of a big burly erasing doofus from a crazy noisy bizarre town (apologies again for the references), <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a> actually brings you a paradise when he pops up. Upon hitting the scene, he targets a Destiny HERO in grave and burns your opponent proportional to that monster's ATK. Prepare to hear that abbreviation a bit more, because his next effect deals with it as well. If Dystopia finds his own is different than usual for any reason, he reverts it back to normal and decides ""You know what? If my ATK can't be what it wants to, neither can you"", in reference to a card on the field he'll be targeting to render destroyed. His material's not as particular as DPE, so you won't be sweating over making him.</li>  	<li>Rarer than the average steak cooked during the taste-testing segment on Kitchen Nightmares is the sight of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> being summoned off a certain Spell. He's really only there for that, because if you thought Dystopia's materials were generic, this guy's a cakewalk. Any Destiny HERO monster and DARK Effect monster bring him out, so he's more or less here as a Foolish Burial for those two monsters. And since the latter one's the definition of generic, who's a DARK monster who provides instant benefit upon hitting the grave? That's right, Shadow Mist! So if your opening hand's not as fancy as you'd like it to be, you can use that silly spell I'm mercilessly teasing to bin her, get another body on the board to summon with, and get cracking on with your plays like nothing ever happened.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Masked HERO</h2> Those of you that have read the manga or gotten your hands on the HERO Strike Structure Deck ought to know these folks like the back of your hand. Some of you may be astonished at the idea of summoning a Fusion monster off only a single material. But hey, sometimes one body on the board's all you need to cause some ruckus. And that's especially true of these guys. <ul>  	<li>Possibly the best HERO monster ever conceived, drawn, printed, and made available in plentiful quantities due to HERO Strike, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a>'s utility cannot be overstated. Despite the fact he's not as rich in ATK as your other Fusion monsters, he more than makes up for it in his effect. Wouldn't you know it? A one-sided Macro Cosmos is STILL amazing in this game, especially with the prevalence of decks that use the GY as a second hand. If that wasn't enough, as a soft OPT, should your opponent draw or search outside the Draw Phase or Damage Step, Dark Law takes notice and puts one card in that grip of theirs with the rest of their would-be GY tools. It's no wonder why we run two, especially if it means providing protection against targeted disruption for the DARK-Attribute HERO used to make him.</li>  	<li>Another DARK friend with a concealed identity is <a data-name=""Masked HERO Anki"">Masked HERO Anki</a>. He's definitely got some biceps to spare, 2800's a pretty good number. And he's proud to have it, as upon destroying a monster by battle and it hitting the GY, he searches another ""Change"" Quick-Play Spell you can immediately use to get another Masked HERO from the Extra Deck and another attack and powerful effect to unleash. You might see him pop up in Duel Links more often, but that's not to say he's not useful in the real deal either.</li>  	<li>If you use Absolute Zero to make this monster, you're either in a pinch, or weirdly sadistic. I won't judge, however. If a tool like that exists in a deck and is easily accessible, why would you not use it? Indeed, I'm referring to the trigger-happy harbinger of melting madness, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Acid"">Masked HERO Acid</a>. Immediately as he hits the field, he unleashes his built-in Harpie's Feather Duster (hard to believe it's legal again after so long) and drops the ATK of your opponent's field by 300 each. Definitely worth Quickie-ing Liquid Soldier or Absolute Zero away to make Swiss cheese of your opponent's backrow.</li>  	<li>Should your Stratos find itself under fire for disruption, one ""Change"" Quickie later, he's safe and in his place is the prime rocket-kicking scarf slinger, <a data-name=""Masked HERO Blast"">Masked HERO Blast</a>. Upon hitting the field, he halves the ATK of one of your opponent's monsters. But he can also, as a Quickie, have you pay 500 LP to return a pesky backrow card of your opponent's to the hand. Useful if you're looking to go into battle or if it's the end of the turn and the card's been set the same turn. You won't see him a whole lot, but I still go wild for his speedy antics.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Xtra HERO</h2> Links? In a Fusion deck? Well, it is post-2015. Hard to see an Extra Deck these days without at least a smidgen of blue in it. Surprisingly, these guys help HERO a lot, especially the first two. Whether you found them in the Legendary Hero Decks or Dark Neostorm, you're definitely thankful to have these on your side. <ul>  	<li>The shockingly common and useful <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</a> makes headlines for good reason. Thanks to your binning and fusing business, you're more than likely to have a Destiny HERO in grave to revive for his primary effect. Secondarily, and building off the first, he tributes a Destiny HERO to add any HERO with a different name from your deck. Is that an unreal amount of searching, or what? It's impossible for me to imagine playing Pot of Prosperity in a deck like this, man.</li>  	<li>Never thought I'd see the day where this cost more than the other Xtra HEROes combined, but I won't really complain. I was years ahead the market and got a good bit of this stuff on the cheap because of my morbid curiosity anyways. Staff in hand and visor in view of victory, <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Wonder Driver"">Xtra HERO Wonder Driver</a> can do a whole lot for your deck. Upon summoning a HERO either way at link point, he grants you the amazing effect of targeting a Polymerization, Fusion Spell, or ""Change"" Quickie in your grave and setting it back to the field. It's amazing if you were to, say, make Sunrise at his link point, set the Poly you used for him, and then use it again for someone like DPE or Trinity. Or even bring out a Masked HERO to his link point and then set the Quickie you used for the summon back to be chained to something later. Yeah um... I think I can see why it's such a big deal now.</li>  	<li>If firepower's what you're looking for, here it is. <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Dread Decimator"">Xtra HERO Dread Decimator</a> shows up when you've already Cross Crusaded and you're ready to lay the damage on thicker than the wallets of those who own GameStop stock. For himself and the HEROes in any of his three link points, he provides 100 more ATK for each HERO in the grave, and he himself pierces. Yeah, he's got a bit of investment and really only exists to break through big walls, but I'd be lying if I said tearing down those walls his way wasn't cool as anything.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Spells</h2> Alright, enough dawdling! I've teased you about that one Spell long enough, as hard not to imagine its title it may be. HEROes make use of a good bit of super cool cards to get the job done, it's honestly astonishing how many of these you can use and still play through disruption so long as you've got one or two to spare in your hand. Least, way I've seen my hand on a good day. <ul>  	<li>Consistency's dripping from the ceiling at this point. <a data-name=""E - Emergency Call"">E - Emergency Call</a> (haha yes funny internet letter) give you a selection of any Elemental HERO of any walk of life and any level. Whether you need a Stratos to start your plays, a Shadow Mist to bin, a Solid Soldier to enable said Stratos or Shadow Mist, an Honest Neos to protect yourself, or a Liquid Soldier to Poly away for Sunrise and get to generating card advantage, this very lovely vowel is at your side.</li>  	<li>And if that's not enough for you, there's the ""If it's Limited it's definitely useful so why not"" alternative search tool, <a data-name=""Reinforcement of the Army"">Reinforcement of the Army</a>. Y'all know the drill if you've played HERO, Phantom Knights, or any number of other worthwhile Warrior decks in the past. Any Warrior at Level 4 or below will be saying ""Hi"" with this in your hand. But that's not the only way to get your important tools out.</li>  	<li>Another Limited and too good to pass up card is the freebie-allowing, advantage-netting, potentially Ash-baiting <a data-name=""A Hero Lives"">A Hero Lives</a>. You love to see it in your opener, don't lie. With a field barren of face-up monsters, you can exchange half your LP for the summon of a Level 4 Elemental HERO from the deck. More often than not, Stratos for the searching thing he's known for or Shadow Mist to get to masquerading. Do NOT pass up the opportunity to fire this off if it's between your fingers.</li>  	<li>What the heck, let's knock one more Limited Spell off the list. I'd prefer if <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> was at another copy or two, but I guess it being here now means more room for other useful cards. Anyways, you're more or less running this if your opponent gets to gumption to drop certain cards in their grave whenever you play certain cards. You know the ones. You can barely take a sip of water and they'll be around the corner waiting to siphon every last drop, mark my words.</li>  	<li>With those out of the way, onto the cards that make big bad boys with the purple borders. Y'all know <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a>, I'm sure. Tossed around in Duel Monsters, and even more in GX when Fusions became dedicated archetype bosses instead of slightly more powerful vanillas. Your go-to way of putting this classic into play is with Vyon, that monocular main man. What is it with the Level 4's in this deck being as good as they are?</li>  	<li>You're always glad to have this when your opponent's targeting one of your HEROes to disrupt or you're looking to make another HERO at Wonder Driver's link point during your opponent's turn to keep the chainable ball rolling. Searchable off Shadow Mist, <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a> is blessed by the little lightning symbol in the top left, meaning you can respond with it and even use it during the Battle Phase to tag out a monster that's already attacked for a stronger one that can give you an additional shot at getting a good hit in. Try and keep at least one on hand or set in your backrow if you can help it. Guarantee you won't regret it.</li>  	<li>Here we go, the other reason Dark Neostorm is so well-revered. <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> and the favors it does for HERO are comparable to Time Thief Perpetua in Time Thief; there's just a world of difference and you'll never go back. For the simple fact it lets you fuse using cards in your deck, it both works to Foolish cards like Malicious, Denier, and Shadow Mist so you can make use of their effects and also makes a powerful body on the board. And if it means DPE can come of its activation, you bet your bottom dollar we're running three of these. Keep in mind that after you use it, you can only Special Summon DARK HEROes, so do your best to get Wonder Driver, Sunrise, and Absolute Zero out beforehand if you need.</li>  	<li>Transitioning into another signature fusion Spell for another sub-archetype, <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> makes headlines for being one of the first cards to fuse using cards that weren't in the hand. It's here to allow Absolute Zero to make waves (or rather, deadly drafts) after Sunrise nets it for you, or for Sunrise himself if you need some extra leeway to make your plays and nothing else seems to be up and running at that time. So for situations like that, it's earned the name.</li>  	<li>Now here's a surprising twist of fate. A Plasma searcher that also grants protection when he's present? Odd. But we'll roll with it. <a data-name=""D - Force"">D - Force</a> is kinda interesting, methinks. With all the searching HERO does, to think there's a Continuous Spell that does it now akin to Live Twin Sunny's Snitch and Fire Formation - Tenki. I won't complain, Konami'll be Konami. Anyways, upon activation, this bizarre concoction of what was once anime-exclusive tomfoolery nets you a Plasma upon activation, and provides two perks and one drawback while he's up. Drawing during the Draw Phase becomes out of the question, cards you control can't be targeted by effects, and Plasma, hoo boy. Becomes 100 ATK stronger for every monster in the GY's, is non-destructible, and can attack twice. Good LORD this deck's got bosses out the wazoo, and Plasma is seriously crazy now because of it.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Traps</h2> Something I like about HERO is that they've got a good bit of flex spots for backrow. Though I guess you could say that for plenty of other decks these days. You can run pretty much whatever you like instead of these or what's in your price range, but these are what I feel work for me personally. <ul>  	<li>Feels blasphemous to start with a monster, but it may as well be a trap, you could say. <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> can be pitched during your opponent's Main Phase to target one of those monsties of theirs and shut them up for the remainder of the turn. I tend to use these on big scary setup pieces so there's only a calm and no storm when it's time for me to play, or when the dreaded Anaconda rears its head. Though, it's not his fault I get jumpy upon seeing him. No points for guessing whose it actually is, however.</li>  	<li>We don't wanna be on the receiving end of those kinds of cards. Your 'Gekis, your No Mores, your floodgates or omni-""no""'s, and you definitely don't wanna get sent to <strong>The Mine.</strong> So just in case those happen and those are a worry to you, get yourself a <a data-name=""Solemn Judgement"">Solemn Judgement</a> or <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> to help you sleep at night. They won't creep up on you no matter how nyctophobic you tend to be.</li>  	<li>Another card I wish wasn't Limited so I could still play the game despite ""those"" kinds of people is <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a>. It was basically designed for going second doofuses like me. Your opponent activates a trap, you show them this, trap goes back down, and although they can set another trap from their deck, no traps can activate on their side for the rest of the turn. Yeah, it's risky and plus's your opponent, but still being able to play the game's appealing to me. Plus, on the off chance they give you that trap on your turn, you can activate it from your hand at the cost of half your LP. I bet by now you probably think I have some sorta vendetta against my silly 8000, but I guess I'm just a ""Pay first, act defensively later"" kinda guy.</li> </ul> &nbsp; <h2>Side Deck</h2> If certain cards in this deck aren't quite to your taste, that's totally fine! I'm not here to tell you how to play this silly thing, but I guess that's kinda what I'm doing right now, heh. Regardless, here are some alternatives I think might be nifty. <ul>  	<li>If veiling effects isn't your thing, see how busting heads suits you. <a data-name=""Skull Meister"">Skull Meister</a>'s a card I didn't really expect to see play too much, but I guess part of a TCG is you never know what's gonna become good sought-after. If your opponent tries to activate an effect in their grave, pitch this guy and you won't see much of that effect anymore. There may be a cuter and more broad-area-covering version of this card in Duel Devastator and other such odd sets, but we all know about Konami and their waifu tax.</li>  	<li>As far as backrow cards, it's the same story more or less. You could run <a data-name=""Mask Charge"">Mask Charge</a> for Mask Change and HERO recovery, <a data-name=""Night Beam"">Night Beam</a> for backrow popping that's harder for your opponent to respond to, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> to well, Reborn things, and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> if the thought of a field full of jerks ready to tear your cards a new one going second is a concern of yours.</li>  	<li>Now here's a way Solid Soldier can dodge disruption. <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dian"">Masked HERO Dian</a>'s surprisingly strong at 2800/3000. But I suppose you don't don diamond getup for nothing. When she pops a monster in battle (I think it's a she?) and has it GY-bound, she summons a Level 4 HERO from the deck. Gets you another body and has the muscle to back it up, not too bad all things considered.</li>  	<li>If Sunrise seems too restrictive to act as a double HERO bin with Polymerization, then turn your eyes to <a data-name=""Vision HERO Adoration"">Vision HERO Adoration</a>, like the way his name seems to imply lots of people do. His effect's kinda situational but alright, targeting an opponent's monster and one of your HEROes on field to drop the first's ATK by the second's for the turn. Personally if I'm gonna bin two HEROes for a body, I want that body to be smoking and strong, hence my run of Sunrise. But again, that's not to knock people who prefer other methods. It's just me nuzzling my cheek up to weird stuff I enjoy.</li>  	<li>Looks like Absolute Zero's not alone as far as omni-HEROes in this deck go. <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Escuridao"">Elemental HERO Escuridao</a> is someone you'd care to tango with should you want to do fun bashing stuff with an Elemental and any Destiny or Vision HERO you happen to have spare. He (or she) gets 100 ATK for every Elemental HERO in grave, which is alright for what it's worth. If you really wanna go extreme, put it up at link point with Dread Decimator while Sunrise is up with another non-LIGHT or DARK Attribute or two while DPE's also there chilling and you've got an Honest Neos waiting in case your opponent somehow surmounts all that. Eh, maybe that's a little overboard. Sunrise and DPE alone do it for me.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  So there's the deck once more. Whether heroes are born or made, I don't regret making this deck at all. Fingers crossed DPE and Denier aren't like, some crazy rarity like Faris or Increase and therefore require you to take out a mortgage to play the deck. Maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part, though. Anyways, before I close, treat your eyes just a little bit more to some handy play notes I typically keep at the bottom of these lists.  &nbsp; <h2>Handy Play Notes</h2> <ul>  	<li>When you're up to bat, try and play through or scout for any of your opponent's hand traps or disruptions if you can. Use cards like D - Force and A Hero Lives first just to be sure they're not saving anything for you, and when the hatches for that are down, go into your bread and butter stuff like Stratos, Faris, Solid Soldier and the like. When your plays in this deck can't get off the ground, it hurts. Or as Chumlee would describe, totally not-licious.</li>  	<li>Keep an eye on your super hard OTP's Shadow Mist and Liquid Soldier. For example, can you search a HERO with another card you have right now? If so, might be worth it to use Shadow Mist to fetch a Mask Change so Dark Law and the gang can be on the prowl later when your opponent least expects it. Do you wanna revive a HERO when you're in a pinch or use your own original card Blaceful Blarity? It can be a really weird feeling when you slip up on these things and realize too late, so just thought I'd add that little note here.</li>  	<li>If you're a Sunrise or Adoration up but a DPE and Fusion Destiny short, plan ahead by getting Malicious and Denier to hand or field early on, then Poly either of those two Fusion guys at the start to Wonder Driver's link point, re-set the Poly in grave, then use it again to fuse Mali and Denier away into DPE or Dystopia, then those orange-bordered little scamps can run free about the GY once more.</li>  	<li>Remember that once you plop Fusion Destiny down and it goes off, DARK HEROes are all you can Special for the rest of the turn. So I stress again that you should get your differently-Attributed boys on board ahead of time, like Sunrise and Wonder Driver, to get use out of them and still be able to make DPE or Dystopia with ease.</li>  	<li>If you find yourself taking damage, feel free to place an Increase in grave into your backrow with his effect. Sure, you may have already had the whole Faris line come and go, but if you've still got Vision HEROes in deck and maybe an extra Vyon, why not? At the very least, it's extra bodies for say, Plasma or any number of your Xtra or Masked HEROes.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  And there we go. Another HERO deck in the works. Feels good to touch the green, green grass of home once more. And if it stays like this, I doubt you'll find me too far from here in the future. Hope I helped inspire you towards HEROes and how they bravely stand up to whatever board their opposition happens to put before them! They're stylish, varied, and oddly priced, but I wouldn't trade them for the world. Or my affinity towards any other version of the anime, either.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be off chilling out with the crew in the schoolyard, causing trouble but never looking too hard."

Years later, I used this exact deck to teach that same friend how to play Yu-Gi-Oh. This is a simple deck that has gone through many changes over the years, and now I believe it is finally completed. Originally, the deck was built in ""Legacy Of The Duelist"" and was based on Chumley Huffington's ""Sunrise Over Oz"" deck. The deck's approach was solely the <span>Fusion Summoning</span> of the powerful Beasts <span>Koalo-Koala</span> and <span>Master Of Oz</span>. After playing with it for a while, I eventually noticed that the deck lacked hand-advantage, graveyard support, and a variety of Extra Deck monsters, not to mention, it was a rather common occurrence to get bricked by drawing nothing but fusion-related Spells and no monsters to activate them with. Also, if the monsters were eventually taken down somehow, there wasn't much of a recovery plan. After multiple testing sessions, those flaws have been covered, and now the deck performs quite well. I've managed to take down my friends ""<span>Slifer The Sky Dragon</span>"" deck a few times with this one, as well as some high-tier LoTD opponents, if that says anything.</span>  <span>The aim of this deck is still based on <span>Fusion Summoning Koalo-Koala</span> and <span>Master Of Oz</span>, but contains other methods of Extra Deck summons, most revolving around the <span>Level 2</span> monsters <span>Tree Otter</span> and <span>Sea Koala</span>, just incase you can't perform a <span>Fusion Summon</span> at the moment.</span>  <span><span><em><span>Big Koala</span></em></span>: A powerful normal monster rocking a solid 2700 ATK. Exists in the deck as half of the <span>Fusion</span> requirements for <span>Master Of Oz</span>. Don't worry about Tribute Summoning this guy, you need your other monsters present on the field, and there are plenty of other Special Summoning methods that can get him out, which will be covered.</span> <span><span><em><span>Des Kangaroo</span></em></span>: The second half of <span>Fusion Materials</span> for <span>Master Of Oz</span>, with a decent defensive destruction effect for taking out weaker monsters.</span> <span><span><em><span>Desmanian Devil</span></em></span>: The decks main searcher. Destroying an opponents monster by battle lets you add 1 <span>Level 4</span> or lower Beast monster from your deck to your hand. All monsters in the deck can be retrieved via this effect, aside from <span>Big Koala</span> and <span>King Of The Swamp</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Fencing Fire Ferret</em></span>: Upon it's destruction, it's effect provides a way to destroy an opponent's monster that is causing problems. Sports 1700 ATK which isn't bad for a <span>Level 4</span> monster.</span> <span><span><em><span>King Of The Swamp</span></em></span>: Can be discarded to retrieve a <span>Polymerization</span> from the deck, or can be substituted as one of the <span>Fusion Materials</span> for a <span>Fusion Summon</span>, effectively increasing the rate of <span>Fusion Summoning</span> by 66%. This is the only monster in the entire deck that is not Beast-type. Included as a support card, there's not really any reason to ever Summon/Set this thing.</span> <span><span><em>Sea Koala</em></span>: <span>Tree Otter's</span> loyal companion and partner in crime, <span>Sea Koala</span> can drop an opponent's monster to 0 ATK as long as you control another Beast monster. One half of the <span>Fusion Materials</span> for <span>Koalo-Koala</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Tree Otter</em></span>: The Divine being within the deck, <span>Tree Otter</span> is the most powerful being in existence. Just kidding, but he does provide access to a lot of combo plays with his fantastic effect. As long as you control another Beast, <span>Tree Otter</span> can raise a single monsters ATK, including himself, by 1000. Works fantastically alongside <span>Sea Koala</span>, <span>Master Of Oz</span>, and <strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong>. Always try to have one of these guys in your hand or field at all times. The other half of the <span>Fusion Materials</span> for <span>Koalo-Koala</span>.</span> <span><span><em><span>Ayers Rock Sunrise</span></em></span>: Specials Summons a Beast from the Graveyard, while lowering the oppositions attack power based on the amount of your fallen Beasts. Best used to summon <span>Big Koala</span>, or restore <span>Koalo-Koala<span>/</span>Master Of Oz</span> if they are somehow destroyed.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fusion Conscription</span></em></span>: Beast-type searcher. By revealing a <span>Fusion Monster</span> from your Extra Deck, you can retrieve one of it's materials from your deck, however, you cannot summon the chosen monster or use/activate it's effects for the rest of the turn.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fusion Recovery</span></em></span>: Returns a <span>Polymerization</span> and a monster used for a <span>Fusion Summon</span> from the Graveyard to your hand.</span> <span><span><em><span>Fusion Sage</span></em></span>: Grabs a <span>Polymerization</span> from the deck.</span> <span><span><em><span>Polymerization</span></em></span>: Used to <span>Fusion Summon Koalo-Koala</span> and <span>Master Of Oz</span>.</span> <span><span><em>Spiritual Forest</em></span>: Prevents the first Beast that would be destroyed by battle from being destroyed by battle once.</span> <span><span><em><span>Dust Tornado</span></em></span>: Destroys 1 of your opponents Spell/Trap cards.</span> <span><span><em>Fusion Reserve</em></span>: Functions exactly the same as <span>Fusion Conscription</span>, but without the summoning restriction. Also allows you to take a <span>Polymerization</span> from the Graveyard if you have any in there.</span> <span><span><em>Mirror Force</em></span>: Destroys your opponents attack position monsters when one declares an attack.</span> <span><span><em><span>Roaring Earth</span></em></span>: Provides the ability to inflict piercing battle damage with your Beasts. If you manage to do so, you can lower the ATK and DEF of a face-up monster your opponent controls. <span>Master Of Oz</span> absolutely loves this card. </span> <span><span><em>Seven Tools Of The Bandit</em></span>: Negates an opponents Trap card activation.</span> <span><span><em><span>Koalo-Koala</span></em></span>: <span>Tree Otter</span> + <span>Sea Koala</span>. It's low DEF is made up for by it's amazing effect. By discarding a Beast monster, you can destroy 1 monster your opponent controls. Creates a brutal combo play when you have a <span>Big Koala</span> and an <span>Ayers Rock Sunrise</span> in your hand.</span> <span><span><em><span>Master Of Oz</span></em></span>: <span>Des Kangaroo</span> + <span>Big Koala</span>. 4200 ATK. Nuff Said (beware of <span>Magic Cylinder</span>).</span> <span><span><em><strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong></em></span>: ""Polymerization-is-missing alternate plan #1"": <span>Tree Otter</span> and <span>Sea Koala</span> (or 2 of the same) can <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> this monster. By discarding 1 material, you generate a <span>Level 1</span> Beast Token that copies the ATK of the strongest monster on the field. Furthermore, while you control another Beast, this monster cannot be destroyed. A very strong power play can be achieved by having a <span>Master Of Oz</span>, 1 or more <span>Tree Otter's</span>, and a <span>Missus Radiant</span> on the field. <span>Tree Otter</span> can be used to boost <span>Master Of Oz</span> to 5200 ATK, while <span>Missus Radiant</span> provides an additional 500. Generate a Token and it will have 5700 ATK. Gaspeth!. Once <strong>Sandayu</strong> has expended its materials, use it as <span>Link Summon</span> material.</span> <span><span><strong><em>Number 29: Mannequin Cat</em></strong></span>: ""Polymerization-is-missing alternate plan #2"". <span>Tree Otter</span> and <span>Sea Koala</span> (or 2 of the same) can <strong>XYZ Summon</strong> this monster. <strong>Mannequin Cat</strong> has a unique method of Special Summoning monsters. By detaching a material from her, you can Special Summon a monster from your opponent's Graveyard to their field. Then, you can Special Summon a monster that has either the same Type or Attribute as one of your opponent's monsters from the hand, deck, or Graveyard. Yet another means of Special Summoning <span>Big Koala</span>. Makes a devastating power play when <span>Master Of Oz</span> is in the Graveyard and <span>Roaring Earth</span> is active. Oof.</span> <span><span><em>Cross-Sheep</em></span>: This monster opens up some interesting combos provided you have a stocked hand. By <span>Fusion Summoning</span> a monster to a Zone <span>Cross-Sheep</span> points to, you can Special Summon a <span>Level 4</span> monster from your Graveyard. By placing an <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> in a zone, you reduce your opponents ATK power by 700. <span>Cross-Sheep</span> also provides effects for <span>Synchro</span> and <span>Ritual Monsters</span>, making it a decent <span>Link Monster</span> for many decks. </span> <span><span><em>Missus Radiant</em></span>: By existing, all EARTH monsters gain 500 ATK/DEF, and all WIND monsters lose 400 ATK/DEF. When <span>Missus Radiant</span> has met it's demise, you can add a <span>Level 4</span> or lower EARTH monster from the Graveyard to your hand. Effectively provides a boost for the entire deck, with the exception of <span>Des Kangaroo</span>, <span>Tree Otter</span>, <span>Fencing Fire Ferret</span>, and <strong>Number 29: Mannequin Cat</strong>.</span>  <span>This deck is quite fun to use. It was one of the first decks I owned physically, and as I've said before, I used an early build to teach someone else how to play the game. If you're a Chumley Huffington, or Beast-type monster fan, try using this updated build of Sunrise Over Oz.</span>"

I decided to play Cocoon of Ultra Evolution so I could go into Scary Moth (a worse Shaddoll Winda, but a Shaddoll Winda nonetheless) during my opponent's turn thanks to Picofalena's equip effect or Living Fossil (you haven't lived until you resolved Resonance Insect's banish effect and special summoned Scary Moth at the same time.) Also decided to play Multiplication of Ants just so I could still go into Beetrooper Armor Horn even if any of my monster's effects get's negated while Insect Imitation is a way that I could still get to Resonance Insect by tributing any of the various level 3 insects in the deck. (You could cut these for 3x Pot of Prosperity and 1x Foolish Burial if you want, tho'.)  All in all, this is the most fun I've had with a deck in a long time and is everything I hoped Ogdoadic would've been but never did and I can't wait for more support in Burst of Destiny."

It's still wip. Im also just using this mainly as a way to share my deck with my friends.</em>  &nbsp;  <span><strong>That being said, let me explain the deck to you:</strong></span>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>1. What is the deck capeable of? / What is your goal?</span></li>  	<li><span>2. What are the possible combos?</span></li>  	<li><span>3. What should you use your searchers for?</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong>1. What is the deck capeable of? / What is your goal?</strong></span>  &nbsp;  Just like with a lot of other decks, your goal is to bring out your fusion or XYZ monsters as quickly as possible. Your best choices for that are <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> into Infinity. Redoer to possibly lock your opponent out of certain combos. <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a> to possibly OTK. And Nova/Infinity to use your opponents summons/combos against him.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>2. What are the possible combos?</strong></span>  &nbsp;  There are quite a few combos you can do with this deck, so it doesn't matter too much if your opponent disturbs one of them since you're most likely going to be able to cicle into another one right away. Depending on what you need at that certain moment those Combos can be:  <span><strong>OTK: </strong></span>  <em>Combo 1: </em>You'll need a <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a> and <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Zwei"">Cyber Dragon Zwei</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber              Dragon Drei</a>/ <a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">Proto Cyber Dragon</a> in your Hand. Normal Summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Zwei"">Cyber Dragon Zwei</a>/ <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>/ <a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">Proto Cyber Dragon</a>. Then use <a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a> to fusion summon <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>. If your opponent has no defense set up whatsoever you can take game.  <em>Combo 2: </em>You'll need <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> and <a data-name=""C&lt;a data-name=&quot;yber Dragon Drei&quot;&gt;yber Dragon Drei&lt;/a&gt;"">C</a><a data-name=""yber Dragon Drei"">yber Dragon Drei</a> in your hand and atleast one Card with the name ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field. Normal summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a>, use it's effect and show <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> to your opponent. Now use your level 5 machine monsters to XYZ summon <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a>. Discard <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a> as it's material. Summon it back from the graveyard with <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> second part of it's effect. Now banish <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Drei"">Cyber Dragon Drei</a> so that <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a> gains 2100 attack. Now that it has 4200 attack, use <a data-name=""Limiter Removal"">Limiter Removal</a> to double it's atk and if your opponent has no defense set up, take game.  <span><strong>Combo Lockdown:</strong></span>  <em><span>Combo 1:</span></em><span> Normal Summon <a data-name=""Golden Gadget"">Golden Gadget</a>/ <a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a>. That let's you summon a level 4 or lower machine    monster from your hand. Doesnt matter which one it is as long as it's level 4. Use those 2 to XYZ summon <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>. With that you can take your opponents top card on their deck, possibly locking him out some combos he planned. The second part of <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a> 's effect is also a quick effect. So whenever he's in danger. Discard a monster material and banish him until the endphase, effectively keeping him alive.</span>  <em>Combo 2:</em> You'll need <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> and </a><a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> in your hand. Normal summon </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Core"">Cyber Dragon Core</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">. Use </a><a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> to special summon 2 </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">s from your deck. Use those 2 to XYZ Summon into </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Nova"">Cyber Dragon Nova</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon""> and turn that into </a><a data-name=""Cyber Dragon Infinity"">Cyber Dragon Infinity</a><a data-name=""Proto Cyber Dragon"">. Now, you can take your opponents combo piece monsters and interrupt their Spell/Trap combos.</a>  &nbsp;  <em>(there are a couple more combos possible but i have to play a quite a bit more in order to figure out which ones are atleast 75% reliable)</em>  <span><strong>3. What should you use your searchers for?</strong></span>  <strong><a data-name=""Cyber Emergency"">Cyber Emergency</a>:</strong> <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>  <strong><a data-name=""Machine Duplication"">Machine Duplication</a>: </strong>2 <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>  <strong><a data-name=""Cyber Repair Plant"">Cyber Repair Plant</a>: </strong>Any Machine Card  <strong><a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a>: </strong>Most of the times you want to put 2 <a data-name=""Cyber Dragon"">Cyber Dragon</a>s from your deck into the GY in order to summon <a data-name=""Cyber Twin Dragon"">Cyber Twin Dragon</a>.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <em>(I'll keep adding more and more informations.

In addition to having the core of your average HERO deck, it has 17 hand traps, 3 Forbidden Droplets, 3 Crossout Designators, and 1 Called By The Grave. It also uses Predaplant Verte Anaconda so that you can make Destroy Phoenix Enforcer in a pinch. So you have a bunch of meta cards in here.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I named this deck ""My HERO Academia"" for...well, obvious reasons. Those reasons being that it's one of my favorite anime, and that it's perfectly thematically appropriate for this deck! If you're going first, try to set up as many disruptions as you can.

This is the deck I've been working on the most over that period of time (other than the stupid BA deck I went x-3 at a CSM with). I really like the deck and feel like it has a ton of potential, and I want to go over that today. This is my current list minus most of the side deck, feel free to build upon it as you please. <h2>Cards n' ratios:</h2> <h3>Main Deck:</h3> <h4>Infinitrack engine:</h4> 3x Harvester - It's a stratos that can be used for some rank 9 plays as well as some turn 1 zeus boards in niche circumstances.  3x Dozer - It summons a guy from deck for a free river stormer, this card would be so busted it it didn't lock into earth machines.  1x Trencher - It's a main combo piece that happens to be really searchable, so only one is needed.  1x Tunneler - It's a pot of avarice for the deck, really good for constantly cycling resources and draws.  1x Anchor Drill - This is really only for some situational dingirsu plays on turn 2, other than that it's not a bad extender.  3x Heavy forward - it's an in theme tenki that can also be an extra material for some cards. <h4>Machina engine:</h4> 3x Metalcruncher - This is another stratos type of card, but with an even broader search range than harvester.  1x  Citadel - Big boi who blows up boards.  1x Fortress - A really powerful extender for the deck that can be really good.  3x Redeployment - The best card in the deck, searching 2 machina cards leads to the most explosive combos  3x Overdrive - Can either get you a citadel for interruption or a metalcruncher for some more searching <h4>Trains:</h4> 2x Bullet train - very good extender with a scarm like effect that allows you to cycle resources from grave  3x Derricane - is good for chain blocking against things like ash as well as a pop under dora. <h4>Box:</h4> 1x Box - this is a very important card, however it's also one hell of a garnet, but you can still pop off without it. <h4>Handtraps:</h4> 3x Skull meister - Just a decently good option for right now.  3x Imperm - just a good generic card. <h4>Staples:</h4> 1x Called - really powerful card, wish it was at three.  2x E.M.R. - it's an Icarus attack for machines, it can be really good at times.  2x Torrential - It's a board wipe  2x Trap trick - This is extra copies of all the other trap cards. <h3>Extra Deck:</h3> 1x Zeus - Incredibly busted card, this deck can even make it turn one sometimes  1x Liebe - This basically ends the game when you summon it  1x Gustav - Burn for 2000 is strong, also can let you win in time.  1x Dora - Just immune to everything, really hard to out.  1x Earth Slicer - This card just blows shit up  1x Phantom fortress - handloop go brrrr  1x Hyperyton - good for negates and playing around nibiru  1x Dingirusu - powerful removal.  1x River stormer - Is yet another searcher for the deck it also can recur itself easily  1x Ballista - This is how you get box  2x Anger knuckle - This gets you a ton of recursion.  3x Goliath - It's a link 1 that has an ok effect. <h3>Side Deck:</h3> 3x Urgent - really powerful for when you have to go second, dead otherwise.  &nbsp; <h2>Combos:</h2> <h3>Basic One-card:</h3> (Harvester, Metalcruncher, heavy forward) <ol>  	<li>summon your main starter</li>  	<li>search dozer</li>  	<li>summon dozer</li>  	<li>dozer summon trencher</li>  	<li>overlay into stromer</li>  	<li>stormer search bullet train</li>  	<li>summon bullet train</li>  	<li>link stormer into goliath</li>  	<li>trencher summon back dozer</li>  	<li>link into another goliath</li>  	<li>link both goliaths into ballista</li>  	<li>ballista search box</li>  	<li>box search tunneler</li>  	<li>tribute ballista to summon tunneler</li>  	<li>link tunneler into goliath #3</li>  	<li>link goliath and bullet train into anger knuckle</li>  	<li>banish tunneler, shuffling back the three goliaths, ballista, and your one card starter to draw 2.</li>  	<li>end phase bullet get back dozer</li>  	<li>Do this every turn.</li> </ol> I'll keep working on this guide in a few more days, but this is what I have right now. feedback is cool."

Spiritual Forest and Melffy Hide-n-Seek together make for pretty annoying boards to deal with too.  <span>Cards you want to see in starting hand</span>: Obedience Schooled, Rescue Cat, Tri-Brigade Kerass/Tri-Brigade Kitt, Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest  Theres a ton of easy extenders such as Watch Cat, Crusadia Leonis who can summon pretty much for free, and Egotistical Ape helps unbrick hands while also kind of guaranteeing Naturia Beast. On the occasional hard draw of Earth Hex-Sealed Fusion, you can get your guaranteed Nat Beast into a free Exterio which can shut down a ton of decks.  <strong>Bambi (Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest)</strong>  -Bambi does what bambi does. Either summon Kalantosa to pop, discard Carpiponica to extend and search, or just summon any level 2 for whatever Link, Synchro, Xyz you need. Bambi is incredible.  <strong>Naturia's</strong>  -Nat Beast is the main, you will make this pretty much every single game. Barkion can be useful for decks that have important traps such as Eldlich or Dogmatika (altho u wont be having fun vs them anyways)  -In the case that opponent isnt playing something spell/trap heavy and you still hard draw Earth Hex-Seal, Gaiastro is not a bad option to summmon. Huge attack with decent negation and typically will be covered by either Hide-n-Seek or Spiritual Forest.  <strong>Quick Synchro</strong>  -Hop Ear Squadron is interesting cause you can make desert locusts on opponents turn, this deck can easily make Old Entity Hastorr and still leave a lvl 2 on the field to spare to allow this combo. If another lvl 2 is left over then going into Vahram, the Magistus Divinity Dragon is a good option.  <strong>XYZ's</strong>  -Rank 2 Xyz can be extremely useful for breaking boards, Sandayu to get over any large ATK monster, and Joyous Melffy's to bounce out to Kalantosa(s) and pop Monsters or Spells on the field.  <strong>Tri-Brigade + Link</strong>  -Tri-Brigade engine just autopilots into Ferrijit and with atleast 1 extender in hand to a 4 material Apollousa, recurrs alot too and I avoided Fraktall so that they can all be beasts in case you are under Obedience Schooled restriction. Unfortunately theres no good Beast Link 4 yet :(  <strong>Other</strong>  -Danger!? Jackalope? is great for draw power and getting free extensions while also summoning Danger! Bigfoot! for free, this sets up very easily for Leo, The Keeper of the Sacred Tree which not only is big in ATK, but if layered with Melffy Hide-n-Seek or Spiritual Forest becomes a nightmare to deal with.  -Alpha, the Master of Beasts (thank god this is an Earth Beast, my themeing OCD would have never allowed it) is ridiculous, breaks boards and can still summon after youve made a synchro or Xyz with Rescue Cat or Obedience Schooled since most deck nowadays leave 2+ monsters on the field on turn end.  -Ayers Rock Sunrise is ridiculous late game, getting an extender and dropping opponents attack by 2000+ is insane, considering low stat values of beasts there can be scenarios where you beat over with Tri-Brigades or even Bambi.  <strong>Closing Thoughts</strong>  Overall i think this deck could be much better by taking out a few fun cards, but I really wanted to keep the feel of a ""forest"" deck in this. Hopefully Mystical Beast of the Forest keeps getting support so that one day I can cut the Tri-Brigades but for now im really satisfied with this.  Enjoy!"

While you do that try to have a scale bomber or sting in gv to bring back the following turn. Depending on the hand you can draw a card aswell with pico, your normal end board should be atlas, lancer, a sting in gv, fly and sting set, and contact ""c"" or retaliating ""c"". Ready fusion could be a inclusion for added consistentcy, it just has a heavty price point. If you want the main combo or others ones ask, might even make a video for this deck list"

It has surprisingly a lot of good matchups against the top meta decks. Even against decks like VW or tri-brigade that mainly use earth or wind monsters.  The deck can gain so much advantage during your opponent's turn. Sometime even just passing on a ns whitebeard with a couple of handtraps in hand is enough to win against Dryton or Prankkid.  Beware you only have a limited number of interaction so you can be at the mercy of your opponent's extenders. Like all other good rogue decks, it's only good if you know you your opponent's deck as if it was your own.  Feel free to change the side deck or the handtrap lineup, the kaijus are a little wierd but tributing a herald, a dragoon or an apollousa to get a dark on the field feels always good."

I guess i can.,This is the deck i was doing before the 'Plasma Boss' thing.  Phenix Enforcer is one of the strongest monster that have been released lately becouse of his easy summon and the disruption that he can do destroying cards in the oponent turn.  So this is the reason I've made this deck. Have fun. And no explanation HAHAH.  !Update: Now the deck is more focused in using Verte Anaconda effect.  Any suggestions are welcome.  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.

You are making Cherubini, send Graff (it is for cost), Graff effect special summons Cir and with that you make Bardiche. When Cir hits the grave special summon back Cherubini. From there you gotta make sure Torn Scales and Ancient Cloak are in grave. Use ancient cloak effect to add boots to hand and special summon Torn Scales with his effect. Then send Gloves with Torn Scales effect and special summon Boots. Now you make The Sea Dragon and special summon Ancient Cloak. Than you activate Gloves to send sword and activate sword to special summon your detached Phantom Knight ( i usually detach Boots). Than make another sea dragon and use the effect to special Gloves from the banished zone. Than overlay the 2 Sea Dragons for F0 Draco Future and make Verte with Gloves and Cherubini. Make sure to activate Boots in grave to add a Fogblade and dont set it. Use it as a discard for Dragoon because it will extent your plays in the graveyard.

It reduces the games you see Tour Guide, but also makes the deck less relaint on the card. In testing I found a 49 card with 9-13 extenders saw Dark Magician and Red-Eyes a reasonably small amount of time, almost never minded seeing Red-Eyes Fusion, and comboed off very successfully in a majority of hands.  First the Phantom Knights package. My mentality for this was to run all the essentials in the smallest numbers feasible (my usual strategy). 3 Torn Scales are essential, this card is an amazing starter in its own right and an important combo piece. Ancient Cloak is a combo piece, we run 2 because when you see it in your hand sometimes you need to send the 2nd, but it rarely comes up so you could get away with 1. It's great to pitch to Torn Scales, so I like 2. 3 Silent Boots, this usually searches Rank-Up Magic towards the end of your combo but we run 3 because it is a reasonable extender in its own right. 1 Ragged Gloves is a combo piece, usually sending Phantom Knights Sword to extend your plays, but also a reasonable ""double"" of all of your Phantom Knights cards. Stained Greaves is weak as an extender, though you will use it that way occasionally. However, sometimes your combo wants to pitch it to summon Torn Scales from the hand, so we run 1. 3 Fog Blade as a searchable interaction that doubles as an extender in your combo. 1 Sword, a combo piece for that combo and an extra extender a lot of the time. And 1 Shade Brigandine, a searchable extender that is also a combo piece. Lastly 1 single Rank-Up Magic Force, so we can make the bomb that is Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon.  The ""fire"" part of the deck is pretty low. The plus side is these are all level 3 extenders that can help make Rusty and Cherubini, so they have that going for them. Cir and Graff are combo pieces and dope extenders in their own right in your combos. Farfa and Calcab are actually run primarily for their ability to double as interaction to help bait out negates, break boards, and shut down backrow.  Tour-Guide from the Underworld is your best starter. You see this card it might as well be over. In certain hands you might start Torn Scales in order to summon Silent Boots, since this is harder to Ash, but this plus an extender is full board, all of your Boss Monsters but Accesscode and Unicorn. 3 is obvious, and these usually summon Graff as part of your combo. But if Graff or Cir are in your hand we run a 1 of Sangan. We don't have a Crusadia card to search, but you can find a hand trap, and the card actually makes it a half-decent normal summon with extenders, since the combo wants cards in its hands. It's not a huge brick in this deck, since we want to discard cards for our combo and to Dragoon anyways, and it is a half-decent Normal Summon (here).  Dragoon Package is 2 Fusion, 1 of each brick. The bricks suck to see, especially when you see both. But 2 Fusion is pretty good IMO. It means when you see Fusion you can pitch one of them and still make Dragoon, but also they sometimes give lackluster hands the ability to start Dragoon. This decks back-up plan is basically to make Dragoon, and the emergency back-up plan is to cast Red-Eyes Fusion to do that.  1 Rota and 1 Foolish Burial are good enough, still. Rota is a copy of any of your powerful warriors, and Foolish Burial is an extender that doubles as interaction, it's just a generically good card.  For extenders I really want to run 9, but if you're counting the BA package which are situational extenders you're running 13. 3 Kagemucha Knight is obligatory, you want to chain-block Tour-Guide. 2 Junk Forward means you have a free extenders to start on, meaning sometimes you can make Cherubini without using up your Normal Summon, but also means you'll never see 3 in the same hand. Then we have the Psychic package, Psychic Wheelder, Psychic Tracker, and E-Teleport, which are basically just generic level 3s in the deck to make Cherubini as well as the Rank 3s that you run as combo pieces. Lastly, we run a since Sea Archiver, which unfortunately doesn't make Rusty Bardiche, but is a half-decent extender for making rank 3s and gives you an extra thing to pitch for those games when you see too many Phantom Knight cards.  For interruption we have 1 Called By the Grave, because we're a combo deck. Then we have Ghost Girls, level 3s with good generic negation effects, run primarily because they double as Normal summons in an emergency, and picked based on which of the Ghost Girls are likely to have an impact in this meta.  The extra deck is almost all combo pieces, then after that we run Unicorn, Accesscode, and a 2nd Break Sword to help break boards and give the deck a good follow-up plan."

A deck that has a recurring theme and relies on summoning a Token, except its cards do not have parts of their names in common like Phantasm Spiral's.  &nbsp;  Anyways, this here is your basic Brave Token deck. Nothing special except for 3 copies of There Can Be Only One, and two Goddesses of the Closed World.  You wanna go first every time so you can set up a board of 1 Brave Token and Wandering Gryphon Rider to negate one of your opponent's cards--not to mention any hand traps or Trap Cards you draw. In other words, this is a control deck.  &nbsp;  As for the title, I named this deck ""Braveheart"" after the 1995 Mel Gibson film. It's not thematically appropriate, but it was the best I could do."

Granted, it's seemingly difficult to drop all three of these cards on the same turn.  Salamangreat Almiraj along with the Smol Simorghs really make this deck shine. For example, Bird of Calamity can send another Smol Simorgh. Then after being turned into Almiraj, come back alongside the other Simorgh, and link off into Bird of Sovereignty."

These archetypes go hand in hand, as cards like Sezreil can destroy set Unchained cards for their cost.  This deck has multiple different paths to reach rather intimidating boards. Most notably, Sezreil searches any Evil Eye card, and Pareidolla searches any Evil Eye monster. Often leaving the pilot with Sezreil+Ammo at worst, and often an accompanying Unchained Soul, or even Zerrzeil instead.  Evil Eye of Seline is the bread and butter to this deck. Being untargetable by card effects, and indestructible turns any tower up to eleven. Not to mention the solid Attack boosts it provides.

DO NOT play 3 blue-eyes unless you decide to play ""Mausoleum of White"" over ""Magical Meltdown"" which then you could play 3 blue eyes so you can get more value out of Mausoleum but then your forced to play ""Maiden With Eyes of Blue"" which you don't really need in a Invoked build of Blue Eyes because you have ""Crystron Halqifibrax"" in the extra deck.

I came up with the idea at the same time that I was learning about Mekk-Knights and then I saw <a>a deck on yugioh-card</a> which had a few Mekk-Knights in it, and thought I should try the Mekk-Knight engine here. <a data-name=""World Legacy's Secret"">World Legacy's Secret</a> is a pretty good card that can also be used to recycle <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor"">Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor</a>, other than providing monster negates when you have a Mekk-Knight. The Mekk-Knight engine also helps with the age-old problem of Ashing a <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> or a <a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a> and stopping you in your tracks. Aside from that, it provides access to Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy and Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star.  Yes, I know that not everyone is comfortable playing about 40 cards, but I've gotten used to running Glads at 45 cards. This is a deck that I want to try in real life, the only cards that I don't have yet are <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Blue Sky"">Mekk-Knight Blue Sky</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall"">Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall</a>."

So this deck is focused in disrupting the enemy while taking chunks of his life points.  Go first.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome."

However, what makes them stand out from most of the compulsive decks that had been put in the spotlight is the ease of getting it's resources; alongside with building boards while recycling monsters that synchronize each other (not related to synchro summoning). In such cases, It can (within one turn) can allow itself to Apollousa at its based 3200ATK. Drytron also can easily open foward with the Dragoon Turbo (if Verte could go 5 minutes without the negations, which doesn't matter for the most part as Dragoon Turbo is just a 2 way intersection). Now the twist is I added in some interesting tech options that have it's fair share of benefits  A new card going by the name ""Ready Fusion"" is a new spell card that shares its conditions with the infamous ""Instant Fusion"" (tl;dr pay 1000LP to Special Summon level 6 or lower fusion Monster). Sadly the deal breaker for the new card is the fact that the only Fusions Monsters allowed to be summoned are Vanilla monsters. Luckily, I have two on my disposal which can be used to Synchro Summon ""Chaos Ruler the Chaotic Magical Dragon"" if needed; or for them to be used to aid extendors like ""Diviner of the Herald"", and ""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"". Another very particular card I used in this deck also happens to be a once niche tech option in ritual decks long ago.  ""Magician of Black Chaos MAX"" is a ritual monster to be summoned with either the spell card ""Chaos Form"" (if the Dragoon Turbo was done successfully), or can be used with Drytron's Ritual Spell ""Meteonis Drytron"" (a much easier option). Now what makes my reason of choice to add it in is due to the effects of shutting down Opponents Monster Effects for the turn; and also the ability to add a spell card from the GY to the hand (of any choice), after a monster is destroyed by battle (not the best effect in the world, but one that comes in handy when you need certain Spell Cards like TTT, Drytron Nova, and Called by the Grave). Monster Reborn I added in there to recover monsters for further play extensions or to regain monsters like ""Magician of Black Chaos MAX"". Forgot to mention that Zeus fits comfortably right in with the XYZ monsters within the deck as well :)"

There are a ton of gimmicks you can mix and match. This is just one of many paths you could take.  Use GrandSolfachord Musecia, DoSolfachord Cutia, Solfachord Elegance, Diviner of the Heralds and or Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm to search the pendulum scales you need, then Pendulum Summon and toolbox. Almost always at minimum your opponent can't negate the pendulum summon (so no Solemns), and usually your opponent can't activate effects (so no Ash, Veiler, Imperm as long as you pendulum summon at least 1 Solfachord).  Crusadia Equimax into Magius + a Special Summon (Angelia, Dreamia, Supreme King Gate Zero, sometimes Trias Hierarchia, even DoSolfachord Coolia) searches a Tuner that summons itself.  Gate Zero can also become a Tuner to access Halqifibrax with it's on-field effect. Pop a scale to summon Shooting Riser Dragon from your Extra Deck, then Gate Zero puts itself into the scale, replacing the card you just popped.  Remember that Ash and Veiler are also Tuners. You can use Veiler + Trias to summon Baroness, or Ash + Gracia to summon Savage Dragon off of Halq, or just Pendulum Summon them if the situation calls for it.  Cross-Sheep can pull a Tuner like Diviner out of the GY for Synchro or Halq plays (or any monster really for whatever you want) when combo'd with Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon.  Verte Anaconda is an easy monster you can summon with even the worst hands and summons basically Kirin 2.0 for free lol this card's mega broken  In simpler gamestates and versus some decks the Solfachords' battle and protection effects really shine. Don't forget that the field spell has a pop effect if you control 3 even-scaled (2, 4, 6, 8) or 3 odd-scaled (1, 3, 5, 7) which even lets you beat things like Mystic Mine. Might play more than 1 copy since a smart opponent will likely aim all their removal at it.  And of course the monsters are cute!"

The target end board:  Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, Ultimaya, Beatice, Dragonlark, Fossil Dyna (summoned on opponent Standby Phase from Dragonlark), Chuche  It's pretty easy to pull off consistently and if you get hand trapped, you can always default back to Crystal Wing + Shenshen + Chuche or Crystal Wing + Caliga + Chuche.  The 2x Effect Veiler and 2x TTT can be replaced with Psy-frame Gear Gamma and Driver. If you go this route you can add in Vahram, the Magistus Divinity Dragon to make with gamma and driver on your turn and pop Vahram with Chuche to destroy all face up cards your opponent controls.  Tip #1: If Fossil Dyna or Caliga are on your field next turn and you need to activate monster effects or special summon, you can use Qinglong to negate Dyna or Caliga and continue playing.

Iris Swordsoul at 1 to interact with the imperms, ghost ogre and ghost sister are just kind of there for covering bases of unknown first games, side them out based on games 2 and three.  The side deck is built to defend against multiple meta plays that are common against prank-kids. Lancea helps if someone plays cards like shen-shen preventing u from getting graveyard effects. Evenly matched for going second, there can be only one against spam decks, etc.  I know it could be better but it has served me well so far."

This deck consist mainly of Lightsworn, Dangers, Chaos, and some Supports. Also I have included the Baroness of de Fleur (OCG, eventually TCG).  I feel that what makes this deck different from other Chaos Lightsworn is that I have included Puzzlomino, which can give you the opportunity to summon a variety of Synchros of different levels. For this deck it helped me to summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon.  As for my Extras Deck, is the generic Number XYZ, Synchro, and Links you will find in this type of deck.  For the Side Deck: I have include more replacement for Extra Monsters. (No hand traps since they are gonna end up milled into the graveyard)  No pro here, so, you are more than welcome to edit this recipe as you like. Hopefully this will bring the Chaos Lightsworn back in game.  Constructive opinions , and recommendations are very welcomed. Enjoy!!!"

Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. : O )  Have a nice day, everyone!"

This deck is fairly simple, it just wants to mill through the deck as fast as possible to set up impressive boards.  This deck specializes in breaking boards, and milling into answers for Barrier Statues. It's fairly consistent, and powerful for the price, but I would love suggestions.  The Lunalights are just a tad bricky, and the extra line-up could use just a bit of work. I'm quite happy with the result though. :D"

There are 3 copies of Numeron Network and 7 other cards that can grab it (Numeron Wall, Planet Pathfinder, and Terraforming), so you should have it turn one unless your luck is as bad as mine. From there you can either summon the Numeron Gates for an OTK if they have 1 monster in attack mode with 2000+ or if they only have 2 monsters than can defend 2000/4000 ATK, or you can summon one of the larger link monsters.  The Slifer/True Name/Card Advance/Soul Crossing package probably isn't the most efficient, but Soul Crossing is a good late game board breaker that will let you either sit on Slifer while you rebuild or close out the game as people struggle with not being able to drop anything less than 2000 ATK. It's mostly just for fun but there have been times where having Slifer comes in clutch.  Running 3 Numeron Calling is risky and it really makes the Extra deck super tight so this can often become a one trick pony. I'm working on the sideboard to make it more resilient in games 2 and 3."

Instead, we're going to unleash a barrage of Direct Attacks and prevent our opponent from stopping it with violence.</span>  <span>This profile is going to be short and sweet, because there are only 2 types of cards in this deck: Monsters that attack directly, and Traps that prevent or punish your opponent for attacking.</span>  <span>There are slight differences in what each card does, and that's what we'll be covering here.</span>  <span>Let's start with the Monsters. Each monster has some sort of unique effect that pops when it successfully deals direct damage. Reminder that each monster can attack directly. <span>Altergeist Meluseek</span> sends 1 of your opponent's cards to the Graveyard. <span>Drill Barnacle</span> &amp; <span>Raging Flame Sprite</span> each gain 1000 ATK upon successfully dealing damage, with the only difference between the two being their base ATK power. <span>Submarineroid</span> and <span>Performapal Swincobra</span> can switch to DEF position after their attack. <span>Ventdra The Empowered Warrior</span> has an effect, but it has no function with this deck's monster setup, and requires 1 Tribute to Summon.</span>  <span>Now let's cover the backrow. The only Spell in the deck is <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span>, which prevents your opponent from attacking for 3 of their turns. <span>Dimension Wall</span> and <span>Magic Cylinder</span> both function the same; bouncing Battle Damage back at the attacker. Be mindful that <span>Dimension Wall</span> does not negate an attack the same way that <span>Magic Cylinder</span> does, just the damage. Save this one for Direct Attacks if possible, your monster can still be destroyed from Battle even after a successful use of this card. <span>Negate Attack</span> and <span>Waboku</span> are basically the same thing and end the Battle Phase. <span>Waboku</span> technically doesn't end the Battle Phase, but your monsters cannot be destroyed and you take no damage, so it might as well just end the Battle Phase. Lastly, the deadly Forces. Regular ol' <span>Mirror Force</span>, <span>Quaking Mirror Force</span>, and <span>Storming Mirror Force</span> all punish your opponent's attack position monsters in a different way. Mirror destroys them, Quaking flips them face down and locks them there, and Storming sends them back to the hand. While we're still talking about the back row, there's one more trick you can do. <span>Performapal Swincobra</span> is a <span>Pendulum Monster</span> and can be set in the <span>Pendulum Zone</span>, activating the effect of sending the top card of your opponent's deck to the Graveyard when Battle Damage is inflicted to your opponent. This can occur once per turn. Placing <span>Performapal Swincobra</span> in the <span>Pendulum Zone</span> is the recommended way to use this monster.</span>  <span>Oh yeah, you have 2 <span>Dust Tornadoes</span> to deal with a couple of things your opponent may or may not do. Use them wisely.</span>  <span>Although this deck is extremely annoying and generally sucks the fun out of dueling, it is not invincible by any means. Blocking Direct Attacks and effect destruction are this decks worst nightmare, as there is no Graveyard support for this setup. I haven't actually played this deck in real life yet, as of now it exists in the Legacy Of The Duelist video games and is used when facing an opponent who is as aggravating as this deck is. If you are a troll however, you might have some fun with this one, it's quite ridiculous my friend.</span>  <span>Feel free to share any ideas or strategies you may have and I'll look into them.</span>"

Do you like gameplays with a lot of hand traps? So… have you a disease to be cursed by your friends? </span><span><b>You came to the right place!!! </b></span>  <span> </span> <span>I present to you all my Anti-meta Magical musketeers!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>Some history</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Back in 2017, </span><i><span>Spirit warriors </span></i><span> was announced with three new archetypes and everyone went nuts with these cards, especially with  Magical musketeers. Some, yet, were considering that it would be the next tier 0, in pair with Zoodiac or Spyral because of the power of these cards. However the time has passed and the “new” tier 0 never saw a competitive success in any YCS or UDS until the release of Battle of legends: Hero revenge in 2019, that gives birth to link-1 monster  “Magical musketeer Max”, a +5 card advantage with the right set up. After that release, Magical musketeer becomes a  serious contender on the rogue landscape, acting like a true anti-meta deck in pair with Guru control or  Zombies.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>How it works?</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>“Magical musketeer” is a series of light fiend monsters that works with columns: if a spell/trap card is activated in the same column of that monster, it can activate its own effect. But its primary effect is to enable (in an inherent effect) the ability to use any “Magical musket” from your hand at any time, at any turn regards that are a spell ou a trap card.</span>  <span>It is so simple but this fact transforms this deck into a hand trap deck powerhouse, where your opponent will never know what to expect as long as your hand maintains itself full of cards.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><b>How to play?</b></span>  &nbsp;  <span>This deck is primarily a control deck that has the first object to break your opponent's tempo, with surgical interaction that shuts down his/her play completely. For a first turn you have to normal summon a Magical musketeer monster, ideal </span><b>Magical musketeer Caspar</b><span> or </span><b>Magical musketeer Starfire, </b><span>that can bring a Spell/trap card or summon another </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>wherever you want, respectively. If you are facing a Pendulum deck, for example, you can summon it on the edge to capitalize by the active effect of opponent scales or summon on the extra monster zone  to catch any unaware duelist.  </span>  <span>If you didn’t  draw any of the </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>said above, no worries my reader cause </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave </b><span> is another great option to summon, It provides a good effect  draw by discarding  </span><b>Magical musket </b><span>card. This can ultimately fix your hand or draw any extender, like  </span><b>Pot of Desires </b><span> or </span><b>Ties of  Brethren </b><span> helping with even more draws or  with the swarmablity of the deck.  </span>  <b>Ties of  Brethren </b><span>is an interesting card in this cek because you can go in so many lines of play . For example you have draw just one </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave, </b><span>with </span><b>Ties of  Brethren </b><span> you can summon </span><b>Magical musketeer Doc </b><span>and</span><b> Magical musketeer Caspar</b><span>, and even draw 2 card by the effect of </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave, </b><span> going  for the end of the turn with a </span><b> Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow </b><span> for some negate in the next turn. The same goes to  a level 4 </span><b>Magical musketeer, </b><span>ending with </span><b>Bagooska </b><span>.</span>  <span> In case you start a second turn, fear not my reader, I got your back. I present to you </span><b>Magical musketeer MAX, </b><span>a link-1 </span><b> </b><span> this card has an effect that you can summon </span><b>Magical musketeer </b><span>monster up the number of spell/trap card that your opponent control OR and to your hand </span><b>Magical musket </b><span>spell/trap cards up  the number of monster that your opponent controls. You can bait, for example an  </span><b>Ash Blossom </b><span> with </span><b>Magical musketeer Kidbrave </b><span>or </span><b>Magical musketeer Caspar </b><span> and go after that on </span><b>Magical musketeer Max </b><span>and nail it!</span>  <span>And what will we add? The powerful and destructive firearms in Yu-gi-oh! card game. The trap card </span><b>Magical musket - desperado </b><span> pops any card face up on the field, a raigeki break from your hand. </span><b>Magical musket - Cross-Domination </b><span> is your</span><b>  Effect veiler </b><span> that negates any monster effect and makes its atk 0. </span><b>Magical musket - Dancing needles </b><span> is a D.

Cyber Dragoon:,"Today I was lazily laying in my bed and started to remember of my gold yugioh times trying to found some inspiration to make a new deck, then i remembered that cyber dragon existed.  The strongest first turn combo is getting Cyber Dragon Infinity and dragoon then disrupt the enemy next turn.  Also as you may note by my complete ignorance about cyber dragon, this is the first deck of this archetype i ever made so it's not perfect, but i can say for sure it's no bad either.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.

Wombo combo time with this slow as heck deck.","<span>Starry knights are a control deck that kind of tries to play during your opponent's turn. I originally thought the deck was underwhelming, but the release of Orbitael gives the deck the grind game and consistency it needed as well as solidifying the ""OUR main phase"" style of play. One thing it still needs is some way to recover their backrow. The new starring knight kind of helps with going second?

Without it, the deck has trouble defending its niche, which is the power of Inferoble Emperor Charles. Otherwise you're just any combo deck, ending on a board full of interactions using your whole extra deck. Still, I like Combo decks. And the Infernoble Engine seems pretty strong TBH, 1 Isolde is a reasonable combo, and you have the extenders and the searchers to make it into an incredible board.  So, why 60 cards? A few reasons. I like the ratios better, assuming you run the far inferior Squeak Knight engine. It leaves space for interaction. And the deck has a lot of ""bricks"" but really soft bricks that you don't mind seeing, as well as lots of small engines it wants to run to do this. Lastly, you have Amazing searching. Between Durendal, Hertiage, Rota, and 2 Power Tool Dragon you have a lot of tools to find the exact starter you need for your situation. That lessens the impact of running more cards.  So, for Starters we have actually a lot of cards. Neo Space Connector is a clear 3 of, summoning Aqua Dolphin from the deck to rip a card out of our opponent's hand. In a spicy last minute decision I'm trying 3 Aqua Dolphin. Here's the rhetoric - this plus an extender is still at minimum Auroradon + Charles + Herald after ripping a card out of our opponent's hand. Additionally, it means they have to burn a hand trap like Effect Veiler on it to protect any other interruptions in their hand and their information, or else immediately lose a card. Lastly, it cannot be Ashed, whereas connector can be. In that sense, since our basic combo is just in through Isolde, simply this plus an extender is actually a better start, especially with Red Layer (since our best combos use all of our zones). One thing I initially missed out on mentioning is that Aqua Dolphin is only a soft once per turn. This means certain hands can lead with Aqua Dolphin, then use Isolde to summon Aqua Dolphin #2 to rip a second card out of the hand. Combined with D.D.R. and Omega you can easily rip 4-5 cards out of your opponent's hand with certain combos. This is super clutch, since it means they have to hand trap Isolde when the real choke point is Halqifibrax. There is still anti-Nibiru play with Gearfried, don't worry about that, but if you don't have Gearfried you really want to maximize your zone usage. We also have 3 Sublimation Knight with 1 Squeak Knight, an alternative 1 card Isolde. I liked the idea of increasing the consistency of the deck while adding a lot of cards, but in turn to keep our ratios high on starters we need to run more. Often Aqua Dolphin itself is a better normal summon IMO, but in a pinch it will help you combo, and combined with Fire Flint Lady the extension makes a free extra Herald on top of things with certain hands, which I like.  The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales is also a starter of sorts, since it too 1 card Isoldes, but it is also the package by which your full combo makes Apollousa as well as Abyss Dweller. 2 of it seems right, since it is such a good starter card in its own right, and because for your big combo you need a copy in your deck, so yeah 2 feels really good philosophically. One thing to note is it special summons itself from the gy when a PK monster is banished from your GY for any reason, so you can use Phoenix Blade to trigger it if you brick with the trap. The trap is also just a viable extender in a lot of starting positions, so it feels sweet actually. We're very weirdly a deck that runs a lot of bricks, but they're like really unbricky bricks that you actually want to see sometimes.  Armageddon Knight and Plaguspreader Zombie are (almost) your last starters. Arma Knight + extender actually feels really good, especially since Isolde searches a useless monster. It also gives you a way to put Coltwing back into your deck from your hand. And it means your combo ends on an extra Auroradon sometimes, not exactly an interruption but something players. The two make Halqifibrax which is good enough as a start in this deck anyways, although obviously inferior to Aqua Dolphin + Extender or many other broken starts. The number of games where I draw these and they're useful is actually surprisingly high, they have the right levels for the plays your deck makes, and one of them is a tuner at just the right level who loves D.D.R. (Dance Dance!) Plus they're good combo extenders coming from some starts.  Okay, so the deck isn't all bricks. We have an Infernoble Knight package. Roland is a relatively free special summon of a Tuner, and at good level for your plays too. It's equip effect is relevant, but it is one of the more important combo extenders, since you use it to make Needlefibre after Apollousa, leading into bigger plays. It is literally the most important extender in the deck, and a lot of the deck is built to search this guy and Renaud out. Renaud is similarly useful, helping make your whole extra deck but Omega with just Isolde + Renaud + Roland, and if you start with Neo Space Connector or Aqua Dolphin you could have ripped a hand trap out of their hand while gaining information. These also, together, start your combos without using your Normal Summon, meaning you can Normal something mid combo, which is pretty sweet in its own right. Ogier you equip to Charles from the deck, but it is technically our last ""starter"" and there are Ogier combos in the deck when you see it, but we have better normals in most hands. You can technically send Durendal off Isolde to summon Renuad, grab Durendal, use Durendal, find Roland to go into Halqifibrax, and it very rarely seems like a good idea, but it isn't really, so don't do it. If you can't set up your Gearfried early set him up late, you basically never want to summon Gearfried unless it is before Nibiru or at the end of your combo.  Deskbot 001 and Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing are here for the Halq / Auroradon combos. The machine package basically lets you make 9 tokens when you combo off fully, and while zone placements matter a lot during your combos having a repeatable way to summon multiple tokens alongside a repeatable tuner to summon whenever you do is pretty sweet. In a pinch I've even Living Fossiled Deskbot, level 1 tuners are just useful. Coltwing is the only ""real"" brick, but A you can shuffle it back into your deck as part of your normal combos, and B there are combo paths where you don't care if you see it even in the rare situations you can't put it back on top of your deck. We're a deck full of bricks you don't mind seeing, very strange list.  Reinforcement of the Army is obligatory. This card is either our best starter or our best extender in any situation, and is great Ash bait too, because of how powerful its effect can be. Heritage of the Chalice is not as good, but it can find all of our most important extenders, including Durendal to find some lesser ones. Durendal is obligatory, and I think you have to run 3. These just find you all your good extenders to start into your combo, and are searchable thanks to Power Tool Dragon, so you really should maximize running 3. D.D.R and Living Fossil are extenders. We need equips in this deck for Isolde, and these cards are decent extenders in their own right, and are searchable if you run them at 3. This means we can make smart choices about which equips we search based on which we ""brick"" with. Yes, my bricks are literally extenders I want to run 3 of. Overdone Burial does sometimes come up in your combos, but is an easy pitch if you're wondering what that third or 4th spell should be. Divine Sword Phoenix Blade is a brick, but you can pitch it during your normal combos to Torn Scales, and even doing that it will save you out on a lot of card disadvantage. Sometimes you have to know when to equip it to Synchro fodder, that's the hardest part of the card. That and remembering to activate its effect every time you want to pitch something.  Gearfried is a good boss monster that protects me from Nibiru and other hand traps early in my combos in most games where I see it, and it the final 6th monster on the board in your ""the nuts"" hands. If we were running fewer cards 1 or 2 would be fine, but I want to occasionally see him. You can pitch him with Ogier and use Renaud to pick him back up sometimes as you start your combos, so keep that in mind. Otherwise it's just this good beatstick with a good negate and a good board breaking ability.  We have a few generic extenders in the mix, to get those ratios up and give us more ways into the combo. Red Layer is searched and send as part of many of your basic combos, but also if you see it you can start your plays with it, without using a normal summon. Fire Flint Lady is better, you occasionally use the second effect, but mostly this just helps start your plays, maybe after Space Connecter gets hand trapped or alongside Aqua Dolphin. You can search Fire Flint Lady with Durendal, which can also be searched by Heritage or Power Tool, provided you're planning ahead with your sends and searches. This does rarely come up.  The rest is interaction. If we're counting on 1 hand trap doing the thing, we'd better run Gamma and Nibiru, the highest impact hand traps in game where they are impactful. After that I'm running Called and TTT, because we're a combo deck with a little hand ripping all the same.  For the extra deck there really wasn't a lot of space. Sometimes you make 2 rank 8s, so you sort of have to run Omega in that last slot, and the other 14 help with your full combo that puts 5-6 boss monsters in your zones with interruption effects and/or floodgate effects. It really is all for that combo, but the deck is built so that even its smaller boards are pretty decent. Expect to see Charles next to another negate after interruptions a lot of the time. The combo is also nice and flexible, since the full combo is so inefficient even makeshift combos often have really good end results, since you can skip some of the more inefficient steps in those situations, depending on the extenders you draw. I think every card in the extra deck is essential.  Sideboard is trash. Solemn Judgement is my go to going first card, even in combo decks. DRNM is my going second card. Cosmic is for trap decks and general backrow. Skull Meister and Droll are pretty good generically right now, and both good against Drytron, so while it's top deck I'm gunning for it, maybe a little too hard.  <strong>Combos</strong>  <strong><em>Basic out of Isolde</em></strong>  Found a better combo.  Make Isolde, add Gearfried  Mill 4, summon Genba  Halq, summon Deskbot 001  Make Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  Summon Deskbot  Make Power Tool #1, guaranteed D.D.R.  Auroradon effect, Tribute itself + Power Tool, summon Coltwing  Coltwing effect, 2 tokens, bring back Deskbot  Make Power Tool #2, guaranteed add Durendal  Make Dracossak in the extra monster zone  Dracossack make 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Synchro Deskbot + token into Balmung  Dracossack 2nd effect, tribute 1 token, destroy Balmung  Balmung effect, bring back Coltwing  Coltwing effect, 2 more tokens, summon Deskbot  Deskbot + 2 tokens, make Shooting Riser, send Red Layer  Shooting Riser + token, make Roland  Roland + Coltwing, make Charles  Banish Balmung to get back Phoenix Blade  D.D.R Summon Balmung  On resolution Charles triggers, pops Balmung  Balmung effect, summon Coltwing, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Make Herald of the Arc Light  Use Durendal, search Renaud  Summon Renaud, add back D.R.R  Renaud + Coltwing, make Borreload Savage  Banish Roland, add Phoenix Blade  D.D.R Roland, make Omega  End phase effects.  &nbsp;  So your final board is Dracossack for another pop next turn, Charles for ongoing popage, Herald, and Savage, all off of any Isolde, plus Omega for hand looping.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Hand Rip combo</strong></em>  So for this one you need any Isolde + Infernoble Knight Renaud  Isolde, add Red Layer  Isolde, send 4, summon Oliver  Make Halq, summon Deskbot  Make Auroradon, summon 3 token, summon Deskbot  Deskbot + 2 tokens, Power Tool #1,  Power Tool effect, add Living Fossil/D.D.R  Auroradon tributes itself + Power Tool to summon Coltwing  Coltwing effect, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Make Power Tool #2  Power Tool effect, add D.D.R (these are sort of flexible, and often what you add depends on your hand + luck)  Xyz summon Dracossack  Detach 1 material, summon 2 tokens, summon Deskbot  Deskbot + Token make Balmung  Living Fossil, Summon Oliver  Make Shooting Riser in the Extra Monster Zone  Dracossack effect, Tribute itself, destroy Balmung  Balmung effect, summon Coltwing  Coltwing effect summon 2 monsters, summon Deskbot  Shooting Riser + token make Knight Captain Roland  Summon Renaud, add back D.D.R  Roland + Token make Borreload Savage Dragon, equips Auroradon  Renaud + Coltwing (now level 7) summons Omega  Deskbot + token makes Herald of the Arc Light  Omega effect, banish it to loop a card, then D.D.R to rip a second card. If you added D.D.R both times you can hand rip an opponent's hand for 3 cards (after Aqua Dolphin). So yeah, try for D.D.R when possible. However, you can also use your searches for Durendal if you already have 1 D.D.R or Living Fossil.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Anti - Nibiru Combo</strong></em>  This one will vary based on your hands, but essentially you need a Gearfried, a way to get him equipped, + any route into Isolde. This forces you to do a slightly stilted combo using a similar route above. A common start for this is Ogier + Durendal, though there are other ways to set up a Gearfried before Nibiru. You'll typically summon Isolde first, then summon Gearfriend as your 4th summon before using Isolde's second effect. You'll go through the route above, but you're forced to Tribute a token for Auroradon, so you'll have Auroradon in the extra monster zone and can't make Dracossack, so it's up to your extenders from that point in the combo.  Often the better answer, if you see Oliver, is to go for the Apollousa Combo, but Gearfried does enable anti-Nibiru play by itself provided you have the right extenders.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Isolde + Oliver combo</strong></em>  This is where the combos start to get nuts, and this start is where you begin making Apollousa.  Your combo starts the same. Isolde adds Red Layer. This time it sends 3 equips, including Phoenix Blade, to summon Phantom Knights of Torn Scales.  Phoenix Blade effect, banish the warriors that made Isolde to add back to hand.  Torn Scales effect, pitch Phoenix Blade to send Ancient Cloak  Ancient Cloak effect, banish itself, add Silent Boots  Special Summon Silent Boots  Link your 3 monsters into Apollousa with 3 negates (sometimes an extra Red Layers makes 4)  Banish Silent Boots, Chain Torn Scales: Summon Torn Scales and add Shade Brigandine (note - in a pinch you can use Phoenix Blade to banish Silent Boots to still trigger Torn Scales, useful if you see Shade Brigandine or start with it, though you have to be careful about your banishes)  Summon Oliver by pitching Red Layer (note: in some combo sequences you can add back Phoenix Blade at this point to pitch, useful with Overdone Burial, but make sure you have an extra warrior to banish in your GY)  Link Torn Scales and Oliver into Halqifibrax  From here you have Apollousa in the extra monster zone and the start to your Auroradon combos, though this will end with 1 less Deskbot, forcing you to use D.D.R/Living Fossil to finish your combos.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Isolde + Renaud + Oliver (+Gearfried)</strong></em>  This is where you put it all together, using Oliver and Phantom Knights to make Apollousa first and then using Renaud when you Summon Roland to sub in for Deskbot while looping you a D.D.R or Living Fossil to make Abyss Dweller with Shade Brigandine. It ends on Apollo with 3 negates + Herald + Borreload Savage + Charles with Roland in the GY, + Abyss Dweller. If you have Gearfried in your hand you'll have 6 boss monsters including 6 negates, a pop, and 2 floodgates, and while on paper this appears to require the perfect hand, we have so much searching and seeing your equip spells or searchers helps you achieve this result semi-consistently.  The real nuts is opening with Red Layer, Aqua Dolphin then Isolding for Aqua Dolphin, then extending with Oliver to make Needlefibre, then making all your follow-ups with Auroradon in the extra monster zone, hoping to hit enough D.D.R to follow up with 2-3 Omega + Herald + Charles (Roland). Hand loop for 5, omni negate, two pops, Gearfried for follow-ups. Sometimes it'll happen, and in ways that are hard to interrupt even with multiple hand traps. Other games you hope you don't need the hand pressure. But the pressure is real, and 6 Aqua Dolphin really increases it. On occasion I've D.D.R. Aqua Dolphin for extra hand pressure. Soft once per turn. Oops. Also notable is you can, with certain hands, use Isolde to summon Aqua Dolphin then make Roland with Aqua Dolphin and Plaguespreader and go into Halq that way. That's right, Plaguespreader isn't a brick, it is an extra hand loop. Towards the end of your combo, you use Shooting Riser to make Charles with Coltwing while 1 token is still on the field. Pretty sweet. If you need to clear up a token, since Roland is in the GY you can banish him for Phoenix Blade, D.D.R him, make Omega, then immediately Banish. This is how you get 4 card hand loops with full boards of interruption.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Drawing Coltwing Combo</strong></em>  So, what if you have Isolde and you draw Coltwing? You can sometimes put it back into the deck with Plaguespreader, but doing that in your main combo route is awkward to say the least, though it is viable. However, even if you draw Coltwing you can combo off, depending on the extenders you draw and your opponent's plays, so it won't always be necessary to go into the ""gimped"" combo. Pay attention to what you have in your hands before summoning Arma knight - however, sometimes it is necessary.  &nbsp;  Changed the deck slightly. Torn Scales impressed me enough as a starter that we're running 3 of it now, and no Squeak Knight. Also added in more extenders so we can start with Aqua Dolphin normal more often. Lastly, I'm trying out Foolish Burial. Burial itself is an extender in the deck, and a pretty good one. Cut Cross Porter, it was just a brick that never came up.  One more thing to note - just like people underplaying Isolde searching Aqua Dolphin, people are also underplaying leaving 3 Durendal in the deck to guaranteed search 1 with Power Tool. This typically searches Renaud to add a sent or used D.D.R. back to the hand while making the level 1 Tuner extender you need in your combo. Search Aqua Dolphin liberally, consider adding Durendal, and make lots of Omegas. Have fun!"

The goal of the deck is to out resource your opponent through the use of eldlich trap recursion and the Live☆Twin engine drawing and poping cards for free while also establishing boss monsters to swing for game.  Obviously with monke deck there is not really any combos but a hand of any way to make twin combo witch is like 90% chance and cursed eldland you can play eldland search conq or huaq make Ki-sikil, Lil-La then summon back Ki-sikil draw 1 then go into Sunny use Sunny summon back both and use Lil-La to pop eldlan send a golden land to grave then remake Sunny or if you searched the 1 of twin trap or hard drew it make Unchained abomination. This ends you on a Eldlich trap set-up and a quick pop and a draw.  If anyone has any recommendations on changes feel free to comment I always want to make my list better. &lt;3"

Metalfoes are a deck that relies on destroying ally cards to gain advantage, while also removing opponent's cards.  Metalfoes want to push the opponent into a war of attrition or a grind game, one that they will easily win due to how many cards they can pop.  Simply place 2 metalfoes in scale, summon bunch of guys, then fuse. The pend monsters effects, if you set a fusion spell with them, you can use it on the same turn, so you always have access to at least one fusion spell. If going second, fuse into Mithrilium, pop a card if you can, then fusion again into Azortless to pop yet another. If Azortless is destroyed, you have access to a pop whenever you destroy an allied card, so don't hesitate to pop Azortless to get that other pop. If going first, just summon Alkahest and set traps plus a parametalfoes fusion to get a strong interrupt plus an opportunity to fizzle a spell if Alkahest is targeted, and a 2500 beatstick during opponent's turn as long as Alkahest is alive. This probably won't come up much, but it's nice to have.  You can play links like Apollousa, or rank 9s like Jormungandr of HeartEarth due to Vanisher. When summoning off of counter, you always want to get a vanisher if possible. Because of this, you should generally not search Vanisher to keep good targets for Counter, and the summoning condition is quite costly nonetheless. I don't recommend Trap Trick because you can't search Combination, and you'll want to keep your copies of Counter. Waking the Dragon can be good if you find yourself losing your backrow too much."

A kingdom of sweets. An enigma to the people that visit this enchanted land. Ruled bya  monarch, the kingdom resembles a landscape made of various confections, with all the edibility that entails. The residents there are even strnagers, resembling plastic dolls or plush toys, thought inquiries into that are usually met with confusion.  The two princesses are the talk of the kingdom. the heiress known as <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Puddingcess</a> lives a charmed life as she attends her royal duties, prepares to inherit the throne, and tries to keep her little sister out trouble. Recent gossip claims that she is enamored with ser <a data-name=""Madolche Chouxvalier"">Chouxvalier</a>, but he seems reluctant to confirm it. Among the nobility lie the royal staff, including the royal teacher <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Glassouffle</a>, the clergywoman <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Sistart</a> and the angel she is in communion with, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Anjelly</a>.  Visitors are often left charmed by the kingdom's delights, thought her political neighbors often suspect something amiss, as if there is a fey air around it. Interestingly, a young child with an expansive doll collection went missing a year before contact with the kingdom as established, and no records tell of the kingdom's existence before that point, furthermore the missing child bore an uncanny resemblance to <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Queen Tiaramisu</a>...""  Well I haven't made a post in a while and I had some decks IRL to adapt to this site's decklist so I'd thought I'd rectify that for once. Be warned thought some aspects of this list are, puns aside, half-baked.  The gameplan of the scrumptious Madolche kingdom seems to emphasize Summoning (mainly from the deck) and their adorable princesses, the eldest of which being needed for certain cards in the archetype to get bonus effects and herself has an Xyz variant that serves as a beater and another way to pull from the deck. The last common ingredient is a reliance on continuous backrow cards. They are predisposed for going second but have tools to weather the storm should they have to go first (of course some of those tools are out of theme and not ones I can apply to the deck yet).  The main playmakers are <a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>. Hooty and Angelly here both summon direclty from the deck, as does Petingcessoeur, but in her case that is meant to bring out her big sister, <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> as the kid reduces the level of any monster she summons and otherwise messes up the Rank 4 plays with any other monster. Magileine OTOH is just a searcher, but one with no HOPT.  Another important card is <a data-name=""Madolche Messingelato"">Madolche Messingelato</a> who can fetch a needed spell card if he's special summoned. <a data-name=""Madolche Mewfeuille"">Madolche Mewfeuille</a> is another normal summon that can summon out another Madolche from your hand. Madolche Cruffsant meanwhile is card that bounces a Madolche to grant himself a level and 300 ATK, a little niche TBF but it is another way for Rank 4 plays and helping proc certain cards.  Moving onto the spells we have <a data-name=""Madolche Chateau"">Madolche Chateau</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Ticket"">Madolche Ticket</a>, all of which are important to the strategy and play off of each other in interesting ways. Chateau is a field spell that brings every doll in the GY back to the deck to ensure certain effects are live and if any subsequent monsters left there are returned to the deck you have the option of bringing them to the hand instead (and it has a 500 ATK boost to Madolche monsters). This brings us to Ticket which can special summon or search monsters every time Madolche cards are returned to the hand or main deck. Last but not least is Salon, which gives us an extra normal summon (Notable because the archetype does have a few cards that plus on normal summon, two of whcih were already mentioned and of those two at least one isn't HOPT) and also helps to search backrow  &nbsp;  Moving onto the traps. <a data-name=""Madolche Lesson"">Madolche Lesson</a> is a simple 800 ATK boost, decent by the standards of such powerups but the effect itself is mediocre since the focus is away from the battle phase. still it can help close out games considering that Puddingcess's Xyz version can reach 3800 with this and Chateau active. <a data-name=""Madolche Nights"">Madolche Nights</a> serves as a monster negate and with Puddingcess herself out a way to remove a card by returning it to the deck. <a data-name=""Madolchepalooza"">Madolchepalooza</a> is...mostly there for fun, the effect to summon any amount of in theme monsters form your hand is nice but kinda wasteful economy wise given they will all return to the deck at the end and as a trap you can't use thus turn one. <a data-name=""Madolche Promenade"">Madolche Promenade</a> is the deck's best trap yet, negating a mosnter in exchange for bouncing one of your own, while also have an effect that lets you attach a Madolche monster to one of their xyz.  This is a pure build so the only off-theme main deck cards here are 2 Kaiju, and playsets of <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>.  Onto the Extra deck, the off-theme ones were cobbled together from cards I have that weren't in another deck. ranging from the metaish such as <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax</a>  to some small utility like <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>, to the less played such as <a data-name=""Evigishki Merrowgeist"">Evigishki Merrowgeist</a> and <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a>. Of course the majority of the ED is dedicated to copies of the 4 in theme monsters. Staring with the OG boss monster, <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Madolche Queen Tiaramisu</a>. Tiaramisu is a primarily reason why the deck wants to go second as her effect a powerful piece of removal with a rate quality that moots certain forms of responses and ""cannot be targeted"" effects. For going first we have <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Madolche Fresh Sistart</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Madolche Teacher Glassouffle</a>, which serve to protect your backrow and one of your monsters, respectably. the latter also has a nifty recycling effect that procs when another Madolche goes to the GY, helping to keep your GY clean. The last monster is <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode"">Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode</a>. Puddingcess here taking on a new dress, 1500 extra ATK and the ability to summon a mosnter from the dekc (provided Puddingcess herself is an overlay unit, this explains Petingcesouer and Prominade's effects)  The side deck here is a more of a concept as I don't have the cards in it IRL (I <em>have</em> most of the cards IRL but they are in other decks ATM). To explain those cards...  Ash, Nibiru, Called, DRNO and Called are staples that need no explanation. As for the more unique pick, lets start with the in-theme cards.  <a data-name=""Madolche Butlerusk"">Madolche Butlerusk</a> is another monster that search a card on Normal summon, however instead of a Madolche cards it is instead a field spell. the catch is that you need another Madolche monster to use it, if you're wondering why this dude wasn't teched in every deck that uses a field spell. He's here more becuase of the fact that I don't currently run Terraforming and Metaverse (despite having a lot of copies of them, I am considering them of course)  <a data-name=""Madolche Tea Break"">Madolche Tea Break</a> is a counterpart to Nights, whereas Nights responds to Monster effects, this card responds to spells, and like Nights,m it also has a Puddingcess reliant bonus effect. In this case popping a card. <a data-name=""Madolche Waltz"">Madolche Waltz</a> is in the side deck concept for some cute Game 3 memes, as it is a burn card that deals 300 damage each time one of your dolls battle, it can also potentially close out games (Puddingcess Chocolat with 3800 ATK plus this means up to 4100 damage), but the changes are minor.  Last card of note is <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>. This one helps search your Normal Traps provided you can spare a copy of the one you want to search and lets you activate it the same turn. Naturally if I do have these in the IRL deck the ratios of some of the traps would bump up.  thus ends my Madolche deck profile. I am aware that this is half baked and that other options are available (Traptrix Raflessia+Gravedigger's for starters). It is for that reason that I will appreciate any feed back you have on this deck. Especially where the Extra is concerned."

Dinos are pretty cool too.,"Enjoy my Cimo-esque talk-man card-by-card.  Topped at locals with this one the last 3 out of 4 weeks (Top 8, Top 4, Top 2). Really been liking the way this runs. Intimidating first turn boards with the excellent grind game that Virtual World brings.  &nbsp;  Main Deck:  Virtual World ratios are pretty typical. I've been thinking of cutting Emergency Teleport for something else as its usefulness seldom comes up. I choose not to play the Toutou as it never seemed to come up in testing. I am not playing Desires two Nyannyan, 2 Chuche, and 1 Xuanwu works just fine. I find that even though you can shuffle things back with Nyannyan, I prefer to have everything accessible without the extra steps if you lose it off Desires.  2 Foolish Burial Goods gets Qinglong in GY. Since I don't play Desires, Goods is an additional way to get you to your starters and attempt to bait handtraps.  Destiny HERO - Malicious is an excellent card to get rank 6 plays going. Additionally, this deck sends from hand to GY at least twice in a typical turn (Qinglong, Xuanwu) so drawing it actually feels really good. You can send one with Beatrice as well.  The main spice in this deck is the three-card Dino package of Overtex Qoatlus, Double Evolution Pill, and Ultimate Conductor Tyranno. Typically, I would send Qoatlus with Beatrice to search for Pill. Then, after a few Virtual World plays, there will be plenty of non-Dinos in the GY. Just like Mali, drawing Qoatlus feels great as well (send to GY with Qinglong or Xuanwu). This means that I do not necessarily need to make Beatrice (though Beatrice will still send Mali so it usually still a good play). Drawing Pill or UCT certainly isn't the best as drawing them means less cards to work with for your combos. Drawing these, however, does not make my hand unplayable (just might end up with less cards in hand when you pass your turn). UCT is an additional threat on turn 1 for the opponent to deal with. Oftentimes, the opponent will remove the UCT but still be staring down a Shenshen and a Chuche.  Drawing the 1 Foolish Burial also means that I don't necessarily have to make Beatrice.  I chose to play 3 Infinite Impermanence and 1 Effect Veiler over the Gamma package as I do not have good luck with Gamma (I know, not the best reasoning). These slots are pretty flexible so use whatever feels relevant and playable.  Called by the Grave is just a good card. Triple Tactics Talent is another good card. I only play 1 because I hate drawing 2 of them (it's also expensive). Metalfoes Fusion is easy discard fodder that'll net a replacement for that discard. And Upstart Goblin makes this a 39-card deck instead.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck:  Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen is a really good card. On field Macro Cosmos that keeps coming back after leaving the field. Also, don't forget its effect on your monsters' attack declarations.  Stardust Charge Warrior, Coral Dragon, and Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys all net cards from draws. Croc's discard 2 to pop quick effect can also come up sometimes.  Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu is nice removal and another 6 for mid to late game.  Vermillion Dragon Mech seldom comes up but when it does, it is very nice to have (whether you're popping an opponent's card or cycling a Tuner to your hand by popping itself).  Geomathmech Final Sigma is great against backrow decks. It can give Geist a difficult body to remove (Geist is one of my worst matchups).  Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow plays around Nibiru.  Virtual World Shell - Jaja is a Dragoon out and can easily get to Zeus.  Constellar Ptolemy M7 cycles back Virtual World names for follow-up.  Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal is the MVP of this deck. This card can get to UCT plays, Mali plays, and even Banshee/Zombie World plays (check side deck).  Number 39: Utopia Beyond is another way to out troublesome cards like Dragoon and is a great OTK enabler. Pair this with UCT to reduce all of your opponent's monsters to ATK and attack each one with UCT.  Gaia Dragon, The Thunder Charger gets to Zeus. The piercing damage cam also come up from time to time.  Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus Sky Thunder is a good card.  Sometimes there is enough grinding to bring the match to time. Battlecruiser Dianthus will win the game in time.  I do not play Fanfan. If I had the room, I absolutely would :(  &nbsp;  Side Deck:  Lancea and Droll are good cards.  Depending on the opponent's deck, Necroworld Banshee sent by Beatrice (or discarded if Banshee ends up in hand) can be extremely powerful (oh yeah, more floodgates).  Harpie's Feather Duster, Cosmic Cyclone, and Red Reboot are good cards (I hate backrow). Thinking of maybe swapping the 2 Evenly Matched for something else but again, I hate backrow."

Warbler is both,  The first two win conditions are assembled nightingale, and recital starling. <ol>  	<li>If you can lava golem opponents monsters, combo out two starlings(buffing lava golems attack by 600 each) and nightingale, or just buff any of their monsters they summon on the first turn, and use nightingales effect. Your starlings can then swing in and make the opponent take the damage from the combat, while you don't take damage and the starlings survive.</li>  	<li>The other way is to get assembled nightingale out with 2-3 materials, on the opponents turn during standby, pop nightingales effect, and hope they dont have a kaiju. Then on your turn, summon 2 recital starlings, buffing nightingale, and use bird sanctuary to put one of them+their mats onto nightingale and swing a million times. Mystic mine can help with this part of the strategy if the opponent over-extends, since you dont have to clear their board to attack directly.</li> </ol> The next section is more of what to do when going first,  1. using simorgh, linkuriboh, and stormcrest is a good way to gimp a deck that isn't running destruction. My go to vs drytron. If you get it with Linkuriboh, that is two or more turns you shut them down.  2.  going into utopic future, then draco, If I don't know what the opponent is doing, I will go into this and pray they dont have a kaiju.  3. This option is the most vulnerable to hand traps, but if you have enough of the combo to do it, can go into a starling, nightingale, 3 mats ensemble robin, If you think the enemy is using wind special summons.  If anyone has any comments or questions, I can answer them. I have a large amount of replays saved on EDO If you think seeing an example play out might be better for you.  &nbsp;"

Negate all targeting. Pierce everything. ,"Hi,  This is a control deck, through negation of targeting effects. The main boss monster is Dark cavalry. He negates any targeting on either your or your opponents field, by discarding a card (multiple tiimes per turn) and does piercing battle damage to monsters in defense position. The Main goal is to get him onto field as fast as possible. It is possible to fusion summon him without polymerisation, through monster effects, which is good as it will  keep a card in your hand for negation.  If you're not getting Dark cavalry out, you're stopping your opponent from achieving their combo through backrow cards such as traps, which can be changed out for traps / spells of your choice or for hand traps as suggested in the side deck.  Through magicalized fusion and necro fusion, you can use your graveyard to further fusion summon.  Thant's pretty much it. Negate any targeting. Pierce your opponent to death.  Still working out best version of deck, so any comments or feedback welcomed. woop."

Dinowrestler Monsters: The archetype is a complete joke, a lot of anime cards with very situational effects depending on whether opponent controls more monsters than you or the opponent does actions for you to generate any advantage, the deck starter only trigger effect when special summon and the best way to bring it by special in turn 1 is with the Iguanodraka and for that the starter has to be in the GY, the field hinders you more than it helps and it's only good in the gy, the fusion is also a joke and it's better use POLY instead because POLY is searchable and also uses materials from Hand, the best monster effects are slow because you only use it in the END Phase, do you want to put a BOSS monster on the field and be BEAT DOWN with it in 2021 konami? Apart from Pankratops and Synchro 8 the deck's interactions aren't that big a deal. Too much restriction for little synergy between the cards.  A lot of wasted potential, I understand that the field only let each player attack with one monster compares to an octagon with 2 fighters, I also understand that they have effects on GY is because as your opponent has to control more monsters than you do for some effects activating so it makes sense you have fewer monsters on the field and also they special summon in the End Phase helps to have only more monsters than the opponent when the advantage effects have already been used. Their being in the GY also feels like a crowd looking at the Octagon above them and trying to help their Dinowrestler when your opponent Special Summons your turn or declares an attack on your monster and Martials that have Battle Hand Trap effects are like your Dinowrestler's team that is battling helping him, it's an interesting theme but it doesn't work after all needing to be merged with the Dino deck to play.  In the end despite what I said if the pure version was efficient enough for you to use the Dinowrestler effects easily and with less restriction and depend less on an opponent's action or the number of monsters he controls, the deck would be enough for the archetype proposal but that's not what happens. The best cards in this game are the ones that you can easily use and automatically generate you advantage and interaction, and this deck lacks that. In closing at least I'll say that despite Link 2's idiotic restriction of only reborning a Dinowrestler monster when used as a Link Material and not a Dinowrestler's Material which would activate its effect when used as Fusion Material it has synergy with Trisbaena to banish the opponent's entire back row. An optimistic thought is in the Dinowrestler Valeonyx card when it quotes Link-3 or higher ""Dinowrestler"" monster which means the archetype has a Link 4 that was never cast but even if it was good it would be necessary to first correct the immense difficulty of this deck to get it putting monsters on the table would need one or two excellent support to fix - that would have to be a pretty absurd effect."

Jurrac Monsters: Battle Phase Oriented, some interaction and card advantage effects when monsters are destroyed or destroyed by battle, some versatility effects interesting to explore but slow in general. Difficulty fielding monsters, too weak for modern yugioh. It would need to be completely redone to be playable today and there are few main deck monsters that can be reused in future support, typical deck that has aged very badly and has not kept up with the game's evolution.  I also leave this very interesting video of a Jurrac decklist for old formats that I found on youtube:  youtube.com/watch?v=I2lQN9YjRwk"

Evoltile/Evolsaur Monsters: The Evolsaur monsters are efficient cards to reach the XYZ Toolbox that the deck uses, not only the excellent Evolzar XYZ but also the other generic XYZ 4, 5 and 6 as well. All Evolsaur have the characteristic of having effects only if they are brought to the field by SPECIAL Summon by the effect of an Evoltile monster which makes them Normal Summon horrible. Its effects vary between giving SPECIAL of other DINOs of the hand or GY or interacting with opponent or searching Evoltile for the hand as well (Follow Up). 90% of Evoltile has the effect of bringing Evolsaur to the field by SPECIAL Summon, most bring it straight from the deck, some bring it from the hand and only one is REBORN from the GY. They have different activation conditions and consistency effects as well. Some don't need to activate the effect to give SPECIAL, you just need to tax them with Spells from the deck. The deck has access to a lot of spells and excellent traps which makes the engine consistent and versatile, it sure is a very well done deck and a very smart game mechanic to use Reptile and Dinosaur to make Dragon-type xyz with the evolution theme . Despite being old depending on the hand you open it is possible to make a very strong end board to beat current decks because it is very difficult to play against two Evolzar Laggia or a Laggia and a Dolkka on the field without counting the Megachirella that returns the materials for xyz. It surprises me how many cards this archetype has (between 25 and 30) and to know that it works properly. It is by far the second best among the only 4 Dino archetypes in the game, just behind Structure Deck Dinomasher's Fury.  Evolsaur lv5 and lv6 are optional and it would be better not to use them and just focus on xyz rank 4 because you don't want to see Evolsaur monsters in your hand so you end up brick less and can use cards like Enemy Controller and Trap Evo-Instant and the best Reptile what is Danger!? Tsuchinoko?. Also use the Utopia engine to take out any monsters with the Rank 5  S39: Utopia the Lightning or OTK with Double or Nothing! Remember that even without using lv6 monsters in the deck you should still use a copy of Evolzar Solda because it is possible to do it with the Trap Evo-Singularity.

Just got into the game for about half a year and I've gotten myself an Invoked Shaddolls deck so I want to share it with you guys. (Also my English is not my 1st language so sorry in advance if I butchered it :D )  Because this is my IRL deck and my budget is pretty low so there wouldn't be a Dogmatika package though It would be slightly better when mixed in.  The main strategy here is to go first and build a board consists of at least 2 interruptions (preferably a negate and Winda) to lock your opponents from playing the game. There is also a pretty neat combo in this deck that would lay out a Mechaba, a Dragoon and a set Schism and I'll tell you guys about that later. First I'll go over a few important notes about the rullings of these cards so that you won't misplay and you won't get cheated on like I did :') <ol>  	<li>     All of the effects of the main deck Shaddoll monsters is a hard once per turn and only once that turn. So no flipping the card face-up to gain it's effect and activate it's other effect when sent to the GY in the same turn. This is also the same for the trap card Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</li>  	<li>     Shaddoll Schism can only be activated during the main phase. It may sound ridiculous to mention this because it's literally the first line of the card text but when I was in my local shop a surprisingly amount of players activate the card in the Battle Phase as an extra attack but that's not a legal play. Also you must remember that the monsters that are summoned using Schism can not attack directly (you should put a counter on it to remember).</li>  	<li>     You can get Ash'ed when using Shaddoll Fusion even though there aren't any extra deck monters on your opponent's field (Even with Meltdown's protection).</li>  	<li>     Your opponent can not Ash'ed your Anaconda effect.</li>  	<li>     If you used Red-eyes Fusion from your hand and the opponent negated it with an Ash, you could not Gamma it.</li> </ol> Ok now for the combo of this deck. What you need in your hand is a Magical Meltdown, a Squamata/Wendi and a Shaddoll fusion card. Another thing is that you can not have neither Resh Shaddoll Incarnation nor Ariel in your hand or the combo wouldn't work. Now here's the combo: <ul>  	<li>Activate Meltdown-get Aleister-normal summon Aleister to get Invocation.</li>  	<li>Link summon Aleister into Moon-maiden.</li>  	<li>Fusion summon Construct by sending  either Squamata/Wendi and the link monster to the GY (Construct cl1 Wendi cl2 to chain block)</li>  	<li>Special summon Aerial face-down and sending Resh to the GY.</li>  	<li>Link summon Gravity controller using Construct (make sure to summon Construct on one of the extra monster zone).</li>  	<li>Activate Construct in the GY to get the fusion card back.</li>  	<li>Activate Resh in the GY to banish it and Construct to flip Ariel and activate it's flip effect to special summon Construct from the banished zone.</li>  	<li>Activate Construct's effect to send Schism to the GY (If you already have the Schism then I'd suggest you send the Shaddoll Beast to draw 1 card).</li>  	<li>Link summon Anaconda using Ariel and Construct.</li>  	<li>Get Schism back to the hand with Construct's effect.</li>  	<li>Activate Invocation to special summon a Mechaba by banishing the Aleister and a light (preferably the link 2).</li>  	<li>Activate Invocation in the GY to shuffle it back to the deck and get Aleister to your hand.</li>  	<li>Now activate Anaconda to get out your Dragoon and set the Schism.</li> </ul> Now you have a pretty scary board with 2 semi-omni negate and a set Schism. If you got yourself to the full combo without any interruptions you've pretty much win the Duel here. But of course in reality the chances of you actually pulling off a full-combo is very rare so make sure to conserve your materials and even if you have all the cards you need for the it, I'd suggest you just hold them off and wait for a better opportunity where you know for sure that your opponent doesn't have a negate for it since all fusion decks have a big weakness in card advantage so keeping your materials to go all out is better in my opinion. Now I'll go over some of the more notable pieces of this deck: <ol>  	<li>Reeshaddoll Wendi: The wind fairy of the deck. This card basically revived the entire archetype when it first came out along with Resh Shaddoll Incarnation. For the longest time ever this deck needs an extender to turbo out your Shaddoll monsters for more material and the ability to recycle it's material or even boss monsters and these two cards basically resolve everything. Having the ability to special summon from the deck is one of, if not, the most ban-worthy effect of all time and this card has it on BOTH of it's effect. Also this card also serves as a wind material for you to go into Invoked Raidjin, which is pretty much a Book Of Moon with legs.</li>  	<li>Shaddoll Schism: The absolute nightmare for combo decks with it's ability to special summon any Shaddoll fusion monsters by banishing the material from the field or GY. So getting out a Winda during your opponent's combo is just a kick to the balls and it can even send to the GY a monster that has the same attribute as the monster that was special summon using Schism's effect-a non-target and non-destruction type of removal is just a cherry on top.</li>  	<li>El Shaddoll Winda: Basically a no for combo decks. You can only special summon once when this card is on the field and with the attack of 2200 this card can't really be beaten over with almost anything. Also did you know that this card can't be destroyed by card effects?</li>  	<li>El Shaddoll Construct: The mommy of the deck. This card was once banned for quite a while before coming off the banlist. Our mommy's strength is not just about her ability to destroy any special summoned monsters before the damage step but also the effect of sending cards to and getting them back from the GY is not once per turn at all. So this card has become one of the most important combo piece of the deck to gain a bunch of advantage.</li>  	<li>Aleister the Invoker: The Invoked and Shaddolls archetypes have always been best friends since the beginning. Being already really strong archetypes themselves , these two works surprising well together to maximize the deck's versatility and ability to turbo out very strong boss monsters and controling the board. This card alone is already an Invoked Mechaba. Overall just a great card for the deck.</li>  	<li>Magical Meltdown: One of the most broken field spell in the entire game. This card shutdowns almost all type of negation when you summon a fusion monster and it also adds an aleister to your hand???</li>  	<li>Red-eyes Dark Dragoon: This is the most controversial card I've ever seen. In my opinion I think this card is just a really good boss monster and it's your choice to take the risk of having 2 bricks in your deck or not.</li> </ol> Alright and that's the deck list. I don't expect anybody to read 'till the end but I hope you'd give it a try and tell me your opinion down the comments bellow. Anything is very much appreciated :D  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

ZW stuff: Gullveig can banish, Valk, milling Banshee to trigger it in the opponent's turn to activate ZW during the opponent's turn. If u already have ZW access, u can mill Balerdroch instead. Chaos Space can search for Valk and return your banished Gullveig's into the ED w/ its second effect to draw a card.  Brave Token stuff: If u open Rite, activate Rite, summon Token, place Journey. Journey eff, search Gryphon, summon it. Normal Nordic, make Gullveig, Gullveig CL1 and Journey CL2 (yes, this chain blocks) search equip, and then resolve Gullveig's effect. If you open Journey, activate it, search Aquamancer, and pitch it. Feel free to banish Journey for your Gullveig activation (chain blocking it of course) as you can simply bring out the second copy next turn w/ the Rite you'll get off of the Aquamancer in GY.  Aquamancer and Foolish raise consistency so that you're basically playing 7 copies of Rite.  When opening Doll Fusion against an opponent w/ an ED monster, the line ive settled on atm is: <ul>  	<li>Activate Fusion, send Winda and Lord, summon Construct into the EMZ</li>  	<li>Construct and Winda's effects, summon Ariel face-down and mill Resh</li>  	<li>Make G-Controller, adding back Fusion</li>  	<li>Lord eff, pitch Fusion, revive Lord</li>  	<li>Resh eff, banish Construct, flip Ariel</li>  	<li>Ariel eff, summon Construct</li> </ul> Now you could send say, Shaddoll Dragon for a s/t pop, or falco for an extra Gullveig mat. As said, I need to rethink the applications of this package.  That should be everything that needs explanation. I realize I havent updated my Tri-Bri list, I intend on reworking eventually."

Starters include the 3x Myutant M-05, 3x Myutant ST-46, and 1x E-tele. You then use either Myutant monster starter to search out a spell/trap (usually Myutant Cry) or a monster to go into Myutant Beast or Arsenal, with Beast being the greater priority target. Pot of Prosperity helps quite a lot with searching out the starters/floodgate traps, and Nadir Servant can be used to send extra deck monsters to destroy cards or gain much more resources to restore card advantage. Severable notable combos below:</span>  <span>1. Starting with Myutant Evolution Lab and a Myutant M-05, you can summon M-05, get out ST-46, pitch both to summon Myutant Beast, summon ST-46 from banished with Evolution Lab, and then search out Myutant Cry, with the option to go into Myutant Arsenal or to continue with other plays.</span>  <span>2. Another combo is with Nadir Servant and Myutant ST-46/Myutant Cry in hand. You can use Nadir Servant, send a Myutant Ultimus, search out Dogmatika Maximus, use Maximus to banish the Myutant Ultimus and send Myutant Synthesis + another fusion (usually Titaniklad). By searching out Myutant Cry and/or having it in hand already, you have essentially set up the materials in grave/banished for the fusion summon of Myutant Synthesis for the next turn.</span>  <span>Notable Exclusions:</span>  <span><span>Myutant Expansion</span></span><span> - While very good for the Myutant archetype overall, cards like summon limit and TCBOO are much more preferred over having this card, which is much slower and does not impact your opponent's gameplan as much as the floodgate traps.</span>  <span><span>Psy-framegear Gamma + Driver</span></span><span> - In theory, the psy-framegear package is ideal because it helps prevent your myutant beast/arsenal summon from being ashed. In practice, however, this card is usually a brick even when you are going first. Effect veiler/impermenance screw you much harder anyways, and this deck has ways to continue plays past a negate on your Myutant starters with cards like Nadir Servant and Myutant Evolution Lab.</span>  <span><span>Myutant GB-88 &amp; Myutant Mist</span> - Both of these cards are bad even within their own archetype. Myutant GB-88 is too conditional and is a really bad normal summon, while Myutant Mist is unable to disrupt your opponent's plays (unlike Beast &amp; Arsenal) and therefore is not impactful enough on the board.</span>  <span>Notable Inclusions:</span>  <span><span>Shiranui Swordsaga</span> - Because Dimension Shifter forces you to banish cards instead of sending them, it may seems that the Dogmatika engine does not synergize well enough with the hand trap. However, with Shiranui Swordsaga, you can banish it from your extra deck to summon a token, which can be used as fodder to activate both Myutant Beast and Arsenal's quick effects.</span>  <span><span>Dimension Shifter</span></span><span> - The best hand trap for this deck. Banishing cards is not a big deal since Myutant Cry and Evolution Lab can make use of banished monsters and the Myutant lvl 8's can recycle banished Myutant spell/traps to the hand. Unlike Ash blossom, which your opponent may be able to play through, an activated Dimension shifter can ruin your opponent's entire turn due to most current decks relying heavily on the graveyard (Tri-brigade, Drytron, Prank-kids, etc.).</span>  &nbsp;"

Pot of Desires and Card of Demise are powerful draw cards, but they have potential downsides so try to use them after seeing your engine pieces. Dragonic Diagram is a great card that can help set up your GY for Eldlich and search your True Draco cards. Monarchs Erupt and Skill Drain can help control the board after you've set up.  Budget options: Cursed Eldland($20 per) → Terraforming+Mystic Mine($9): Provides consistency and forces negate. Evenly Matched($13 per) → Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju($2 per): Helps go 2nd and break boards.  Other cards to consider: Artifact Lancea: Cosmic Cyclone and Evenly Matched hurt the deck a lot. Twin Twisters: faster s/t removal for backrow decks. Domain of the True Monarchs: to lock your opponent out of the extra deck.

So some key cards:  Vampire ghost ogre: serves as an better version of uni-zombie in vampires(dumps vampire from hand to search an level 4 or higher vampire, and then be able to dump retainer/familiar from deck/banish to provide additional normal summon)  Retainer/familiar: easily searchable/summonable s/t and monster searchers  Uni-Zombie: no explanation needed  Vampire scarlet scourge: when summoned, can bring back any vampire from grave for 1000 lp/summon any monster destroyed by it via battle  Vampire Fraueline: zomibie honest(not opt.)  Vampire Voivode: the main deck boss(genesis sucks too much lol), when brought out on turn 2+ via normal summon, can summon 2 monsters from opponents grave(which can be used for links, sheridan and undead vampire), can special summon itself from gy when a monster is summoned from opponents gy(too easy for vampires tbh), and partial monster effect negation.  (Grace, Duke, and Red Baron are good as one offs imo)  S/T lineup:  Vampire's Desire: Foolish Burial/level changer, as well as an monster reborn in 1 card. 3 c0pies at all times  Vampire's domain: additional normal summons/lifepoint recovery when dealing battle damage(imo 1 is fine due to searchability, but 2 copies can be good too)  Vampire Domination: Archetypal omni negate+lifepoint recovery(3 copies are good, but feel free to run 1-2, as its easily searchable)  Vampire takeover: archetypal metavers/call of the haunted(when field zone is empty): good 1st turn option, bit gets weaker in other turns(run 1-2 copies)  Vampire Empire: Zombies gain 500 atk during damage calculation+ when a card is milled from opponents deck, dump 1 vampire from hand/deck to grave, then destroy 1 card on field(non-tageting). (Decent, but as its easily searchable feel free to run 1-2)  Tech cards:  Foolish Burial: Zombies LOVE the graveyard, so...always use this  Monster reborn: No need for explanation.  Book of life: good 2nd turn card(remove from play 1 monster in opponents grave to summon 1 zombie from your gy)  Called by the grave: no need for explanations here.  Additional tech cards:  Jack-O-Bolan: Can special summon itself from hand by dumping 1 zombie from hand, can banish itself to ss a zobie in either gy(use th ezombie world varian if you want to use this properly  Zombie World: No need for explanation.  Necroworld Banshee: Can search afforementioned field spell(whther on the field or when its in the gy)  Mezuki: again, no need for explanation(banish itself to ss a zombie in your gy)  Gozuki: no need for explation here as well(foolidh burial, and when sent to gy: banish 1 other zomie in the gy to ss a zombie fron hand)  glow-up bloom: when sent to the grave, can banish itself to add an level 5 or higher zombie to your hand, or if ""zombie world"" is on the field: special summon it(good searcher, but even better with zombie world)  Doomking balderoch: seriously, no need for explantion(good target for glow up blooms special summon effect, can ss itself from the grave when ANY field spell is up during either players standby phase, can once per chain negate an zombie monsters effect, or banish an zombie from either the field or in the opponents gy)(use with zombie world).  Zombie Necronize/Power Struggle is good also.  &nbsp;"

You always wanna go in seccond with this deck.  After trying to get the link summoning methods in my head I asked some people in reddit and they told about the crusadia archetype. They even made a deck with this tool in order to me to get the basics of link summoning and I felt in love with it. After watching some videos about the lore of the cards I believed they were inspired in Final Fantasy lore, specifically 7. God even some characters have are very close to the game ( yes I'm talking about those lions and little mages) and a tryceratops tank (in this case the Tryceratops is Thicc). Oh and the Kaijus are basically the weapons.  Now the strategies  Otk deck = You want to go second  Basically you want to see kaijus and crusadia power/arboria in your hand with anything else from the deck other than the trap and the codebreaker. The kaiju allows you to have a clear way from annoying cards (dragon, any despia, plasma or any other hero that is a pain in the ass) to deliver a one punch since maximus doubles equimax/avramax damage, being easily over 8000 and easily oneshoting in turn two. We have four here cuz this is my deck and I made it budget friendly but you could go for 6 even. They are always good to get your hands on and can save you games.  Crusadia power basically makes a magius unegatable and unaffected (not by counter traps if you try to chain it) but also makes your monsters nibiru proof. Yea who would thoght about that. And the token? don't worry about it, that is the whole reason of the Link Spider.  If your opponent already knows the deal and doesn't summon anything (only way to screw over your otk) or makes you play first you can always go for the Codebreaker (You need to have at least 3 monsters that can special summon themselves from your hand and at least 2 different crusadias) to get a two negate apollousa and a one negate equimax that can get you one of the two world legacy cards in the deck (Krawler basically) to make your opponent regret making you go first. Only weakness about this is our Rocky ''Friend''.  &nbsp;  Fire desires if you already have codebreaker or doesn't even need him, or bait the opponent if they have a lot of negates on the field in other to kaiju the other. Twin twister with Arboria, since she is a very good protection, or anything else, any flood gate or anything else will kill your will to play the game, so it is better to be safe than sorry. Always good to have our super dino friend that tributes himself in order to pop one of your opponents card. Jigabytes and Ranryus combos with magius but you could trade them for Parallel Exceed and a Mudskipper.

","<h4>   Win without normal summon.</h4> &nbsp;  This is an OTK deck where you have only one combo.  I chose infernoids becouse they are the only (not sure) monsters easy to special summon and that cannot be special summoned by other ways so perfect target to monster Gate/Reasoning.  To make the main combo you will need <strong>the right</strong> <strong>cards in hand </strong>and <strong>good RNG </strong>to extract it's maximum potential.  <strong>  The right</strong> <strong>cards in hand</strong> are Guardian Dreadscythe (the boss monster), 2 low level infernoid monsters and a monster gate. There's a secondary version with just Guardian Dreadscythe and Reasoning.  <strong>  Good RNG, </strong>it's basically don't end the game sending the 2 Dreadscythe's equip spell to the graveyard while gotting the maximum of monsters in the grave.  Monster gate and reasoning interactions with this deck are really interesting because instead of using them to summon a random monster we use to send tons of monsters to the graveyard and summon only one. Also... I need some sleep, ill finish this guide later zzzz.  &nbsp;  !1!update; I'm back :)  If you already have <strong>the right cards in hand</strong>; this is the combo with monster gate (With Reasoning just trigger and jump to the third step): <ol>  	<li>Summon a low level infernoid or a Photon Thrasher.</li>  	<li>Use monster gate on the it and see the magic happening.</li>  	<li><strong>Good</strong> <strong>RNG</strong>, if you are luck you may get a tons of monster in the grave.</li>  	<li>Monster gate/Reasoning special summon Eatos.</li>  	<li>If Infernoid Onuncu was send to the grave or is in your hand, special summon and active it effect, destroying Eatos and any enemy monsters with no protection on the field.</li>  	<li>After Eatos has been destroyed you can active Guardian Dreadscythe in your hand, special summoning him and in sequence equipping Reaper Scythe - Dreadscythe.</li>  	<li>At this point you have a spell/trap negate and a BEG beatstick so just destroy your enemy.</li> </ol> <p>Notes:</p>   The whole deck is made for this combo and will break if you got 2 Eatos in hand or send 2 Reaper Scythe to the graveyard.  Is easily disrupted by any trap deck or decks using ash blossom so i recommend you to use against friends and other casual decks. At least until 2031.  Pot of prosperity is bad since you may not win in one turn but helps alot to get a perfect hand.  Hidden Armory can save you from losing by having no Reaper Scythe in deck and can search Power of Guardians to protect your boss monster.  Infinite Impermanence is the only hand trap i could think that can't be special summoned, psy-framegear gama could've been a very good hand trap for this deck but unfortunately you would need at least one psy-frame driver and that would add one more layer of RNG to the combo.  !2!Update: Added Photon Thrasher.  &nbsp;  Sorry fo any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome."

Cards like Mirror Force, Swords of revealing light, or Kunai with Chain are used to temporise the game to let the user get the cards he wants.  The original monsters are pretty weak and their effects are useless so Noble Arms Destiny and White Veil are used to give immunity to destruction or effect and cant get combine with  Silent Swordsman also used as support and can become an ace if other strategies fell  The extra deck monsters like Number 39 or Heroic Champion Excalibur are easy to summon and can become huge damage dealer"

If you have luck and you choose if you want to go second or first always pick second, because you can get a Cyber Dragon from your Drawn Phase and special summon it and you can still normal summon in this turn.  2. Play for ""Cyber Dragon Nova"" from which you can go for ""Cyber Dragon Infininy"". But you can still go for ""Cyber End Dragon"" and ""Cyber Twin Dragon"".  3. When you get ""Future Fusion"" and play it go for ""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"" or ""Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon"" and for the materials always remove <span class=""VIiyi"" lang=""en""><span class=""JLqJ4b ChMk0b"" data-language-for-alternatives=""en"" data-language-to-translate-into=""bg"" data-phrase-index=""0"">at least</span></span> one ""Cyber Dragon"" and one ""Cyber Dragon Core"" and for the rest of the materials remove ""Machina Fortress"", ""Cyber Eltanin"", Armored Cybern"", ""Cyber Valley"". At this point your ""Chimeratech"" monster will be like 6000 ATK and DEFF, but If you want you can remove even more depends on the situation you are in.  4. Don't forget about your spells and traps, because most of this cards can bring you back monsters from your GY.  5.

So of course ideally you want to go first setting up the 3 magnet warriors and sometimes Naturia Beast or Hyper Psychic rider for small disruption using Adamancipator Researcher. I didn't include more Adamancipators because I wanted this to be just Magnet Warriors with Adamancipators and not the other way around. The deck can make Imperion Magnum the Super Conducting Battlebot with Proxy F Magician though I quite rarely make it. Usually it is there to finish off opponent with its powerful omni negate effect when opponent is low on cards, usually after my OTK fails. </span>  https://youtu.be/Hru8vfvszAU"

Most optimal route is opening either of the new Stardust monsters and <a data-name=""Stardust Illumination"">Stardust Illumination</a>.  Activate Illumination to Foolish Burial the other Stardust; <a data-name=""Stardust Trail"">Stardust Trail</a> if you drew <a data-name=""Stardust Synchron"">Stardust Synchron</a> and vice versa, normal summon a monster and activate the Stardust Synchron tributing the monster to special summon Synchron.  Search off the Synchron summon for <a data-name=""Arrive in Light"">Arrive in Light</a> and activate Trail to special summon.  Activate Arrive in Light to stack <a data-name=""Converging Wills Dragon"">Converging Wills Dragon</a> then synchro summon Stardust.  Chain 1 Arrive in Light chain 2 Stardust Trail.  Stardust Trail will summon a level 1 token then draw the Converging Wills with Arrive, activate the Wills and summon it off the draw.  Activate Illumination in grave to increase Stardust Dragon to level 9 then synchro for 11 and you have your <a data-name=""Shooting Majestic Star Dragon"">Shooting Majestic Star Dragon</a>.  There's so many ways to toolbox your way around you're just going to have to test the deck to find.  Way too many to type out here.  Give it a shot, pretty fun deck and can get exceptionally mean if it goes full combo.  Oh yea, can also play through a negate sometimes depending on your draw but not always, good thing to point out."

It ROTAs for a <strong>Vampire</strong> and either sends <strong>Retainer</strong> or <strong>Familiar</strong> to grave and it is also a quick eff Normal Summon. You want to use <strong>Familiar</strong> to search <strong>Ghost Ogre</strong> for a follow-up next turn and you would want to search either <strong>Vampire's Domain</strong> or <strong>Vampire Domination</strong> with <strong>Retainer</strong> for more plays this turn or disruption.</span>  <span>Spells/Traps: 2 <strong>Eldlixir of Black Awakening</strong> which summons a Zombie from deck which is most important. 1 <strong>Eldlixir of White Destiny</strong>. 3 <strong>Eldland</strong>. 3 <strong>Vampire's Domain</strong> which is still a great additional normal summon enabler and a way to get back those LP you just burn through. 1 <strong>Vampire's Desire</strong>. <strong>Vampire Ghost Ogre</strong> is your main source of a <strong>Foolish</strong> and<strong> Scourge</strong> is a lest costly revive so you don't quite need it. 3 <strong>Prosp</strong>. 3 <strong>Scarlet Sanguine</strong> which summons a Zombie from Deck or Grave most importantly. 3 <strong>Conq</strong>. 2<strong> Huaq</strong>. 1 <strong>Vampire's Domination</strong> which is a searchable omni-negate. You could bump <strong>Huaq</strong> to 3 if you cut <strong>Vampire's Desire</strong> also.</span>  <span>Extra: 1 <strong>Zeus</strong>. 1 <strong>Gaia Charger</strong>. 1 <strong>Dragulas</strong> for style points tbh. 2 <strong>The Undead Vampire</strong> which is just untargetable <strong>Chaos Ruler</strong> that can yoink a monster that you milled from either player's Deck. This isn't Control Zombies so you are going to have to make it using 2 stolen monsters which isn't that hard with <strong>Scourge</strong>,<strong> Baron</strong>, <strong>Sheridan</strong>, and <strong>Crackdown</strong>. 2 <strong>Vampire Sheridan</strong> which can send a card to Grave and it can also steal a monster that was sent to the Grave by card effect. 1 <strong>Vampire Knight Bram</strong> which also steals monsters and you can make it using <strong>Golden Land Traps</strong>. It recurs itself so its okay at 1. 1 <strong>Accesscode</strong>. 1 <strong>BLS Link</strong>. 1 <strong>Vampire Fascinator</strong> which is honestly here to link off monsters. It isn't that great here as compared to in Control Zombies. 3 <strong>Vampire Sucker</strong>. 1 <strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck: 1 <strong>Vampire Voivode</strong> which is definitely playable but isnt that great except for very niche situations. 3 <strong>Nib</strong>. 3<strong> Kaijus</strong>. 1 <strong>Vampire Fraulein</strong> which is good but since we are playing actual <strong>Vampire</strong> cards, it isn't as versatile due to you constantly burning LP. 3 <strong>Twin Twister</strong>. 1 more <strong>Vampire Domination</strong> and 3 <strong>Crackdown</strong>.</span>"

Control the flow of the game !!!,"This is an better and updated list to the v1 list that I released earlier this month I have had some time to really understand the deck's strengths and weaknesses, I have make some significant changes to the deck to make to run more consistently and address the previous issue of going first and not being able to counter your opponent effectively.  Cards cut Ash Blossom, Invoked Purgatrio, Dragon Shrine, Dragon Revival Rhapsody, and Twin Twisters (moved to side deck)  Card ratio's change Blue-Eyes, Aleister, Effect Veiler, White Stone of Ancients, Invocation, and Silver's Cry.  So my thought process to get this build was one of two things, cut cards/change ratio's stopping the deck from being consistent and having less brink hands. For example I changed the ratio's for the Invoked engine so that one it don't brink but you also still get good value out of it, support cards like newly added ""Terraforming"" and ""Foolish Burial"" allow allow for the deck to have easy access to Aleister and Meltdown. Now you might be thinking why would you wanna foolish an Aleister well if you open or draw into Invocation you can foolish Aleister to grave and then Invocation is fully live as you would banish Aleister from grave and it becomes a plus 3 as Aleister would be added to hand you'd have a Invoked Fusion monster on board and Invocation back to deck via effect. In terms of the Blue-eyes engine I changed the ratio's for both Ancients and Blue-eyes with Ancients the grave effect is the most important so that if you need to discard a Blue-eyes or Alternative you can add them back, with Blue-eyes I changed the ratio to 3 previously I said not to play Blue-eyes at 3 unless you decided to play ""Mausoleum of White"".  The thought process here was 1 Blue-eyes is a hand lock one is a grave lock and the third is open to be used in the way you need it to be, you need one in hand mainly for Alternative plays can be used for Trade-In plays and added back with Ancients or Seyfert. With the extra deck I substituted ""Invoked Purgatrio"" for ""Number 68: Sanaphond The Sky Prison"" for 2 reasons one because Purgatrio is harder to use as Ash was cut from this build so it would rely on opponents using Ash or them playing Fire type monsters which is not realistic or consistent and two Sky Prison is more consistent as it's a rank 8 that makes opponents have to overextend if there deck is grave special summon reliant.  Master and Sage are your MVP tuners, Master can also be used to get a rank 8 play off with ""Linkuriboh"" which is a mini combo in this build which would summon Master get normal summon effect if not negated you can add ideally a Sage of Veiler back to hand then link it off for Linkuriboh use Master effect in grave target Linkuriboh and special summon a Blue-Eyes monster. In terms for going for Synchro plays it all based on the duel situation if you to play more aggressive use Crocodragon and if you need to play more defensive play Spirit Dragon package, Cloudcastle can be used from defensive or aggressive but ideally only use it if you have another level 9 monster in grave so you can go into Enterblathnir which yes it gets over Dragoon.  If you have any questions or recommendations please feel free to leave a comment and I'll get back to as soon as I can."

PK mirrors are funny. anyways, despite the number of bricks in the deck (Dragoon package, BA package, and toketomborg) the deck is rather consistent because of the bamboo engine. Basically he just wanted a free draw 2 without the downside of Allure of Darkness so he doesn't have to run as many DARK monsters to get it off consistently. Of course the usual dragoon package allows PK to still have a solid board present through some disruption, and the lack of tour guide is because ""you do not want your normal summon negated, especially in a deck like PK where negating the effect just stops your turn right there."" But then you might be asking the question ""well then why not run Kagemucha knight? It can chain-block against ash"" well that's because 1: Tour Guide can still be veilered/impermed and 2: ""kagemucha knight is a nice extender, but since it only works on normal summon, it can brick so i didn't run it.""  &nbsp;  TL;DR: this man is smart and actually reads the cards"

This deck is very consistent, can play through multiple negates/disruption","Gain access to your boss monster, the ultimate apex predator: <em>Ultimate Conductor Tyranno,</em> using <em>Souleating Oviraptor</em>, or summon it through <em>Double Evolution Pill</em>, searchable with <em>Overtex Qoatlus</em> and <em>Animadorned Archosaur</em>, in order to crush your opponent with it's immense sheer force! This deck can also utilize <em>Shaddoll Fusion</em> to lay down extremely suppressive fusion monsters such as <em>El Shaddoll Winda</em>, <em>Construct</em>, and <em>Apkallone</em>, while also triggering the various GY effects of the <em>Shad</em><em>doll</em> monsters used as materials, as well as a few of the Dinosaur monsters, such as the aforementioned <em>Overtex Qoatlus</em>, or to send <em>Mis</em><em>cellaneousaurus</em> to the GY in a pinch to summon <em>Animadorned Archosaur</em>!  Two basic combos:  <strong>Combo 1</strong>: <em>Shaddoll Fusion -- </em>While your opponent controls a monster that was special summoned from the extra deck, you can activate Shaddoll Fusion to send one of your four Shaddoll monsters to the GY, as well as Overtex Qoatlus, in order fusion summon El Shaddoll Winda, and to gain the effect of the Shaddoll monster used as material, as well as add a Double Evolution Pill from your deck to your hand. From there, since you can only special summon one more time this turn due to El Shaddoll Winda's effect, activate Double Evolution Pill to banish the materials used to summon El Shaddoll Winda to summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno from your deck!  <strong>Combo 2</strong>: <em>Souleating Oviraptor and Babycerasaurus</em> -- Normal summon Souleating Oviraptor and use it's effect to add Miscellaneousaurus from your deck to your hand. From here, activate Miscellaneousaurus' effect in your hand to discard it. Now, not only are your Dinosaur monsters well protected from your opponent's card effects, you can banish Miscellaneousaurus to summon Animadorned Archosaur from your deck. Next, activate Animadorned Archosaur's effect to destroy the Babycerasaurus in your hand and add a Double Evolution Pill from your deck to your hand, and Since Babycerasaurus was destroyed by a card effect, you can activate it's effect, and summon a second copy of Babycerasaurus. Here's where things get tricky. Activate Souleating Oviraptor's effect to destroy the new Babycersaurus, and special summon one of the two copies of Babycerasaurus back from your GY. Since Babycerasaurus is not Once Per Turn, you can use it's effect again because it was destroyed by Souleating Oviraptor. Special summon Giant Rex from your deck. Next, link summon Linkuriboh using Animadorned Archosaur, then link summon Secure Gardna using Linkuriboh. After that, activate Double Evolution Pill to banish Linkuriboh and the remaining Babycerasaurus in your GY to summon Ultimate Conductor Tyranno from your deck. Finally, xyz summon one of your two Evolzar monsters using Souleating Oviraptor and Giant Rex. During your opponent's turn, Ultimate Conductor Tyranno can destroy Babycerasaurus and flip all of your opponent's monsters face down, and then since Babycerasaurus was destroyed by a card effect, you can special summon a new level 4 or lower Dinosaur monster! Try summoning another Souleating Oviraptor to add another Dinosaur monster  to your hand who will help you out next turn!"

OKAY since I explained fewer combos last time I'll explain all things now  To start you only need one of the Magistus monsters and one of their spells and it's better be not &lt; Aleister the Crowley &gt; cuz it's hard, to start with it. the first thing you need to do is to XYZ summon &lt; Rilliona, the wonderous Magistus witch wardrobe &gt; ( warning do not XYZ summon Ninaruru we never gonna summon that card  understand !! ) after you do special summon  &lt; Zoroa, the Magistus of flame &gt; equipped with Ninaruru or whatever you wanted just be careful what type of monsters your opponent playing in the extra deck. and then we're going to synchro summon &lt; Zoroa, the Magistus of daimon &gt; then if had field spell &lt; secret village of spellcasters &gt; activate that, don't limit the field spell we need that much more then other cards but if your opponent were playing a spellcaster archetype just find a way to summon &lt; Aiwass, the Magistus spell spirit &gt; and take control of it when he summoned that.  you may ask what &lt; PSY-Framelord Omega &gt; doing here, well if you think he's only here to return your banished Magistus monsters you're wrong the first reason I added that card was to return back &lt; Magistus Vritra &gt;Magistus Vritra is the only way to protect your equipped Magistus monsters and cards when you don't have your field spell, you should not summon Omega first turn you need him in your second turn.  well let's look at the extra deck we 3 additional hand traps ( Nibiru - droll &amp; lock bird - artifact Lancea ) you only gonna replace them with ash blossom and ghost belle, also we have 2 other synchro monsters to replace with other synchros &lt; Adamancipator Risen - Dragite &gt; &amp; &lt; stardust Dragon &gt; but you can also use &lt; Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend &gt; and for the last be careful when using &lt; Magistus theurgy &gt; you can even use that on your opponent turn.  anyways yup don't forget this archetype hasn't finished yet, there are 4 or more supports cards left to come in the future due to their story  till next time see ya  (&lt; Magistus EDITION 25 &gt;)"

What this deck do is basically synchro summon in the start and in the late game otk with a big link combo.  The only reliable turner in the deck is Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame and even with only one turner the deck is consistent.  Magistus archtype is very flexible so you don't have only one combo to do and is always situational.  Spellbook engine is easy and give you a draw 2.  Brave Token engine uses many cards but is easy too, Just ~activate Rite of Aramesia ~then Journey of Destiny ~With journey take Wandering Gryphon Rider but if you are planning in Synchro summon with the token DON'T take Gryphon, take Aquamancer instead and stop here ~if you added a Gryphon then special summon him and activate Journey of Destiny to equip your token with his exclusive equip spell ~active the equip spell effect if you need, Gryphon is a omni negate by the way.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.

And in return you get more tokens to possibly go into bigger plays. The monsters used in the extra deck can be changed depending on what you prefer but i think the dark fusions are mandatory for the strategy.

This deck is pretty good at interruption,swarming and recovery which I'd likely recommend for beginners and intermediate players. Although banish Myutants are much popular than Dogmatikas given that Dogmatikas itself are more expensive cards, it doesn't take away the fun of going toe to toe against with both rogue and meta decks. It's easy  to use that it just follow the same pattern as the Shadoll Invoke where you usually start with Aliester, here you starts with the smaller myutants waiting to get to get interrupted by Ash, Veiler or Impermanence then proceed to Almiraj then Dogmatikas. Swarming is pretty easy and just like Shadoll Invoke, you have to keep in mind to fusion first before using the dogmatika cards. The synergy of this two archetypes is really high given that Myutants are the offensive stance while Dogmatikas set the GY and field for defensive purposes. Extra deck monsters are versatile depends on the situation,.you got toadally for recovery , Titaniklad for the dogmatika setup, Pegasus and Harbinger for defense and lastly, Numeron dragon for offense which you can fully utilize it's effect even if it got destroyed by card effect (Presumably you can set Myutant Cry or any Myutant traps from your GY). Overall, this is the peak iteration of my Myutant build I've been making for months. Hope this helps, good luck and have fun."

 This deck aims to control the board by placing Predator Counters which in turn make monsters affected by them level 1 and basically abusable by the user.  <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> can use monsters with Predator Counters DARK and usable to fusion summon  <a data-name=""Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra"">Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra</a> can kaiju those same monsters away with no response for your opponent  <a data-name=""Predaplant Spinodionaea"">Predaplant Spinodionaea </a>can summon a Predaplant from the deck if he battles a monster with lower level than him, all within the damage step  <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> is the deck's main wincon, negating the effects of all monsters your opponent controls with a counter and can also put counters herself huh!  <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> is the secondary boss monster who can negate a special summon from the extra, primarily Xyz, Synchro and Link, AND turn into a giant behemoth under certain conditions  <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning</a> is the main wincon of this deck along the aforementioned monsters, being able to set up and send a plant from the deck as cost and put counters is highly unassuming, only certain people will acknowledge this card as a real threat so it will mostly pass without any interaction.  <strong>Combos-</strong>  &lt;!--more--&gt;  Well, here are some simple combos that have a HUGE payoff, let me explain them:  <strong><em>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio + Edge Imp Chain:</em></strong>  <em>Normal Ophrys-&gt; Send Chain as cost-&gt; Special Cobra-&gt; Cl1 Cobra,Cl2 Chain-&gt; Add Patchwork + Instant Fusion or any Fusion card-&gt; Make Cherubini using Cobra and Ophrys-&gt; Activate Cherubini by sending Ancient Cloak-&gt; Search Shade Brigandine via Ancient Cloak-&gt; Summon Shade-&gt; Make Bardiche-&gt; Activate Bardiche, send Boots then set Fog Blade-&gt; Activate Instant Fusion-&gt; Summon Winda-&gt; Activate Patchwork-&gt; Add Chain + Fusion Sub-&gt; Activate Fusion Sub-&gt; Make Dragostapelia or the second Winda-&gt; Search the second Fog Blade via Boots-&gt; Activate Fusion Sub by shuffling Winda back to the extra deck thus drawing a card-&gt; set the second Fog Blade. (End Board: 2 Monster Negates/Winda/+3 Card Advantage)</em>  <strong><em>Predaplant Chlamydosundew + Edge Imp Chain:</em></strong>  Normal Summon Chlamydosundew-&gt;Fusion into Chimerafflesia using Chain and Sundew-&gt; Activate Chain's effect thus adding Patchwork-&gt; Search Polymerization and Chain via Patchwork-&gt; Make Dragostapelia using Chimerafflesia and Chain-&gt;Seach a Fusion Spell via Chimerafflesia next standby. (End Board: 1 Negate/Predator Counter Placement/+0 Card Advantage but Superpoly Searchable)  <strong><em>Cordyceps Combinations:</em></strong>  It can be easily sent to the GY via <a data-name=""Predaplanning"">Predaplanning so sending it to the GY is not a problem.</a>  The combos with him include but are not limited to:  Spinodionaea + Chlamydosundew: Special both-&gt; Put a counter via Spino's effect-&gt; Fuse via Chlamydosundew into Starving Venom/Triphyoverutum or Chimerafflesia. (End board: 1 Big Fusion, Your Opponent is negged 1)  Sarraceniant + Chlamydosundew: Special both-&gt; Fuse into Chimeraffleia or Starving Venom-&gt; Search a Predap card. (End board: 1 Big fusion + Any Predap card)  Darlingtonia Cobra + Sarraceniant: Special both-&gt; Search any fusion card if you didn't proc Darlingtonia before or she was in your starter hand-&gt; Fuse into Starving Venom or Chimerafflesia-&gt;Proc Sarraceniant for any Predap card. (End board: 1 Big fusion + Any Predap card)  <strong>Math-</strong>  &lt;!--more--&gt;  As a going first deck, i did every calculation based on 5 cards on hand.  <strong>You have 43% of opening 1 normal summon</strong>  <strong>You have 59% of opening 2 normal summons</strong>  <strong>You have 12% of opening 1 normal summon + Predapractice</strong>  <strong>You have 16% of opening 2 normal summons + Predapractice</strong>  <strong>You have 16% of opening 1 Oprhys Scorpio or Chlamydosundew + 1 Edge Imp Chain</strong>  <strong>You have 24% of opening up to 2 Oprhys Scorpio or Chlamydosundew + up to 2 Edge Imp Chain</strong>  <strong>You have 14% of opening 1 Oprhys Scorpio or Chlamydosundew + 1 PK engine card</strong>  <strong>You have 25% of opening up to 3 Predaplants + up to 3 Predapractice</strong>  <strong>You have 10% of opening any of the normal summons + Instant Fusion or Called by the Grave</strong>  <strong>You have 34% of opening a normal summon + Predaplanning</strong>  <strong>You have 40% of opening a staple + a normal summon</strong>  &nbsp;  <strong>End-</strong>  Well, this is the end, the deck is still in development and awaiting any support from konami, thus i hope that i will get some anime cards like Lilyzard or Ivy Bind Castle.  The problem with the deck is the lack of in archetype extenders and ways to stop your opponent's plays, the amount of resources needed to make Dragostapelia is also a problem, if she was easier to do like Chimerafflesia then i wouldn't be mad at it.  Thank you for your time here and hope you have an interesting day."

The Strat for this deck is to gain control of your opponent with setting traps, using revival spells, special summoning level 8 and going into controlling XYZ monsters. Use these Big monsters to intimidate your opponent and scare them out of attacking, I will say this now I can brick but there are many different stats for this deck. Darkwurm is in this deck too because of Dark Rebellion Dragon which has some great effects and makes it easy to beat over big monsters."

Esto es gracias a que la principal fortaleza de esta baraja es BANEAR con cartas como Dimension Shifter, Macro Cosmos y Dimensional Fissure no importa si va de turno 1 o 2, si no tenemos como evitar la activación/resolución de los efectos de estas, se nos hara muy complicado el duelo conforme pasan los turnos; lo que beneficia a los Ritual Beast, pues son capaces de jugar alrededor de este ban con cartas como <em>Ritual Beast Tamer Wen,</em> su magia rápida <em>Ritual Beast Return</em>, y algunos de sus monstruos de fusion, que son capaces de<em> regresar al Extra Deck</em> e invocar de forma especial 2 de sus monstruos baneados estos son <em>Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin,</em> <em>Ritual Beast Ulti-Apelio </em>y <em>Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk</em>. </span>  <span>Aunado a esto, aprovecha lo anterior para escalar en los link con <em>Harpie Conductor</em> ya que solo necesita 2 mounstruos de viento y asi llegar a <em>Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty </em>con quien en la End Phase invoca otro floodgate en la forma de <em>Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds, </em>con lo que se acaban las invocaciones especiales de todo aquello que no sea atributo viento.</span>  <span>Ya para finalizar aunque no menos importante, si todo lo anterior falla siempre esta la vieja confiable de usar kaijus y quitarse de inicio algún monstruo molesto, para asi poder usar los efectos del <em>XYZ Lightning Chidori </em>con quien no solo podremos quitarnos algun Set que tenga el oponente, si no que tambien podemos reciclar nuestro kaiju al desacoplar un material a Chidori y mandar nuestro kaiju al tope de nuestro mazo.</span>  <span>Para conocerlo mejor, solo descargarlo y pruebalo en tu app/programa para jugar YGO! en linea.</span>  <span>Nos vemos y..., Buen Duelo.</span>"

Combo and matchup is in the video down below.  There are 2 combo lines being used here.  <strong>4-3-3</strong>: <strong>Ivaldi+Gullinbursti+Tanngnjostr</strong>, in this line it's better to make Thor because it provides 2 recursions (Thor eff and new trap eff).  <strong>4-4-2</strong>: <strong>Ivaldi+Alviss+Vanadis send Mara</strong>, in this line it's better to make Loki/Odin because we use both Nordic Alfar tuner and Nordic Ascendant tuner (2 recursions: Loki/Odin eff and Alviss GY eff). This combo line is added because Zeus is able to wipe the 4-3-3 line endboard and turns off both the 2 revives (Thor eff and new trap eff), despite the combo giving more advantage.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Main Deck</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><strong>3 Alviss</strong>: One of the best normal summon because we will have guaranteed recursion if it's in the GY. It got great GY eff, so we run 1 each of the Aesir at least to freely choose which one is perfect for the situation. The first effect is kinda niche, as you need to send 1 monster you control, means you will lack material for regular synchro summon as <strong>Alviss effect is not treated as proper synchro summon</strong>.</li>  	<li><strong>3 Ivaldi, 1 RotA</strong>: The new Nordic support, best normal summon because it allows the 4-3-3 line to get full advantage (add this card back from GY via Gullinbursti, summon it next turn).</li>  	<li><strong>2-3 Gullinbursti</strong>: Only 2 because it cannot add itself back if using the 4-3-3 line, especially if you run smaller Nordic lineup, you don't really wanna draw this name on the first turn if you only open 1 Nordic monster.</li>  	<li><strong>2 Tanngnjostr/Tanngrisnir</strong>: Just another Nordic name, but play 2 since its needed in 4-3-3 line to summon from deck.</li>  	<li><strong>1 Vanadis, 1 Mara</strong>: For the 4-4-2 combo line. Vanadis is a Nordic Ascendant for Odin revival, while Mara is a Nordic Alfar for Loki. Mara also allows Halqifibrax play (either for Selene Accescode or Shooting Riser sending Aquamancer or Token Collector).</li>  	<li><strong>1 Nordic Relic trap each (Gungnir and the new Valinn)</strong>: Valinn is super good negation with revival (1 eff per turn) while Gungnir doesn't need Aesir name to interrupt.</li>  	<li><strong>I don't run the new Nordic Relic spell Hildskjalf</strong> because the e-tele eff locks us to Aesir (yeah the link 1 is Nordic, can't summon that) and the GY eff negs us because it needs a shuffle back. We'd rather run more Nordic monster than drawing Foolish Burial Goods to achieve the same.</li>  	<li><strong>Regular Brave Token lineup</strong>: 3 Aquamancer, 3 Rites of Aramesia, 1 Foolish Burial, 1 Journey of Destiny, 1 Wandering Gryphon Rider, and 1 Dracoback the Dragonsteed equip.</li>  	<li><strong>3 Hippo Carnival</strong>: Seems random but you can chain this to summon 3 tokens as link 1 Gullveig banish fodders.</li>  	<li>The rest is just staples.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span> <ul>  	<li><strong>2-3 Gullveig link 1</strong>: Only 2, because it's hard to resolve the third one, and by that time we're already lose/win anyway.</li>  	<li><strong>The Aesirs</strong>: 1 each for Alviss play, but play more Thor and Loki. Thor gives you potential bait/crackback if summoned via Alvis GY eff. Loki recurs any trap by reviving itself, it means the opponent has to think if they want to remove our trap before removing Loki as Loki can add it back, while at the same time Loki is protected by our link 1 Gullveig making it harder to remove before the trap.

Fissure</strong> does.  Basically the same scenario above.  Make your floodgate stick, and beat over things.  You probably make <strong>Ophion</strong> anyway, because it's <strong>Evilswarm</strong> and that's just what you do.  -You stunned them with <strong>hand traps</strong>, and they leave a board with a 2k or lower ATK monster that you <strong>Utopia Double OTK</strong> over.  <strong><em>Congrats on not making Ophion</em></strong>.  -You make <strong>Origin</strong>, and your opponent just really wants to try their shiny new <strong>Destroy Phoenix Enforcer</strong>, and they keep making you +1 because they haven't seen this deck in 8 years.  That or you made <strong>Exciton</strong>/<strong>Raigeki'd</strong> under <strong>Origin</strong> and got a huge plus, those are always nice.  <strong>Ophion</strong> still beats a lot of things by itself, assuming you can protect it from things like <strong>Cerb</strong>, <strong>Unicorn</strong>, etc.  Room for 9 hand traps.  I run <strong>D. Shifter</strong>, <strong>Ash</strong>, and <strong>Imperm</strong> with a set of <strong>Droll</strong> in the side.  <strong>Gozen</strong> is a must since it generally checks whatever <strong>TCBOO</strong> doesn't.  You can probably swap <strong>Judgements</strong> for <strong>Strikes</strong>, but I like <strong>Judgement</strong> for floodgate protection.  <strong>Torrential</strong> is fun to play with considering <strong>Origin</strong>, making it an incredibly viable tech choice.  I like <strong>Prosperity</strong> over <strong>Allure</strong> by far, since you can pitch 6 from your extra pretty safely to give you a lot of flexibility from that search.  You're very vulnerable to <strong>Ash</strong> considering <strong>Prosperity</strong> and <strong>Rabbit</strong> getting hit hurt a ton, but that's just life.  The deck is 8 years old at this point, this was the best I can do, give me a break.  <strong>Other Notes:</strong>  -Keep <strong>Mandragora</strong> in the side, it's not worth the main slots.  You pray that you go 1st and establish <strong>Ophion</strong> Game 1.  <em><strong>Focus on nothing else.</strong></em>  -<strong>Thunderbird</strong> is trash, don't run it.  -<strong>Allure</strong> is OK if <strong>Prosperity</strong> is out of budget.  -<strong>Iron Dragon Tiamaton</strong> is still very fun, and can easily lock your opponent out of both Links and Level 5's if you summon <strong>Ophion</strong> to your EMZ, and lock out theirs with <strong>Tiamaton</strong>.  Tech it in for casual play, but it's probably not viable for competitive play, especially after you first drop it."

The deck was built to cover weak points of most other decks, the many kuribohs allow for little damage to be dealt to the user of this deck. Red-Eyes Dragoon allows for quick negates and it allows you to slowly take apart your opponent field ( Destruction dragon serves the same purpose. .) The multitude of trap cards is if your opponent has better cards; this deck also has your stereotypical lava golem. Mystic mine and gravity bind are for the purpose of stalling the opponent until dragoon or destruction dragon can be summoned. You can use the combo of, scapegoat- wait a turn using stall tactics than summon linkuriboh, you can do this twice. (you need to have kuribohrn in your hand to pull this off.) Once your opponent attacks you can use the remaining scapegoats to special summon linkuriboh again (due to its effect.) than once its effect is used up than use kuribohrn to bring linkuriboh back."

My favorite is summoning Daredevil, summoning Whale and using Whale's effect to dump a Frightfur to the grave to make a monster gain half it's attack points, summon Sabre-Tooth with Whale to bring back whale to use it's effect again. And if you just power up Daredevil you have a monster with 6400 atk on board with 2 other big bodies to wipe out your opponent."

Both can ""chainblock"" very important effects like Wolf's monster recursion and most notably, Gazelle's mill. I played Fowl mostly since it got a shiny new print in Ghost from the Past but have now cut it in order to play Archiver at 2.  Archiver is fantastic. Not so fantastic that I want to see it constantly, it is ""only"" an extender after all, which I'm not too dependent on, but being able to send it with <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> or <a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a> without losing out on it's effect is fantastic and chainblocking not when you perform a Link Summon (which is when a lot of chainblocks happen, Gazelle or Exceed block Bale, Bale blocks Buff, Exceed also blocks Wolf) but instead on the summon after. <a data-name=""Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf"">Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf</a>'s recursion triggers when a monster is summoned in it's zone and <a data-name=""Salamangreat Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a> triggers on its own summon, which can be summoned to the zone a link monster points to. That means that Sea Archiver can increase the odds of some of your most important effects to go through.  But wait, there's more. Sea Archiver, like <a data-name=""Salamangreat Spinny"">Salamangreat Spinny</a> is a Level 3 that banished itself if it leaves the field after having used its effect to extend. With Miragestallio, this is no longer an issue. So not only do you get to chainblock your valuable effects with this card, it also servers as an extender the following turn, which is were Salamangreat was already difficult to stop.  &nbsp;  The presence of Miragestallio also made Bufferlo a much more attractive target for Cynet Mining. Miragestallio is essentially a Gazelle in the ED. Of course, you could also add Gazelle off of Cynet Mining and try to go into a r4nk play, but if you can't do that, you can always draw 2 and summon Gazelle afterwards. Or just take the +2 over the r4nk anyways, depending on the deck you're facing and how addicted you are to Dopamine.  &nbsp;  Since last time I've dropped <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>. It's just not as necessary anymore with Miragestallio around and this version is more backrow oriented. It's essentially ""Overextending, the Card"".  I've since also added Ghost Belle back to the deck. It's a good handtraps and still nice to see past turn 1 since moving cards from the GY is a mechanic that's not only used to build boards but also by established boards. I played around with cutting Belle and instead playing Will at 2 and the Solenms at 3 each but I like the look of this deck as is.  Solemn at 2 might seem a little weird but 4 is more than 3 and I don't really care which if these Solemns I see. I play a lot of backrow, so Judgment isn't just a worse Strike in this deck, they both have their strong suits and I'm usually happy with either, so I'm playing 4 instead of 3, that simple.  I also changed the Heatleo to Knightmare Phoenix. People are siding Contact ""C"" against Tri-Brigade and you can't really out it without Phoenix. Lost me a YCS game and I'll be honest, that stung a little. I think I won't say goodbye to that card for a while now.  Also finally fixed the Foxy, Spinny ratios. I still think 3 Foxy is fine in Bufferlo decks, since it's another target for Bufferlo but if you only play 5 copies out of the 2 cards, yeah, I'll admit you should play 3 Spinny - 2 Foxy.  &nbsp;  These were my thoughts behind the changes I've made, I don't think there's much else to say and I think after my fourth Salamangreat list it's okay to not write half a book for once, so I'm outta here. See you on the next one.  Oh, anyone else keeps forgetting the word Buffalo? I was thinking earlier how the real animal's spelled and it took me a solid minute to not think of 'Bufferlo' for once."

With just Elemental Hero Blazeman and Mask Change in the hand, Blazeman and use it's 2nd effect to send Shadow Mist from the deck to the grave simultaneously activating Shadow Mist's Graveyard effect to search any HERO from the deck and allowing Blazeman to be sent to the grave with Mask Change to summon Dark Law. Alternatively Elemental HERO Solid Soldier or Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier can quickly summon Shadow Mist from the hand or grave respectively fulfilling Shadow Mist's special summon requirement to search a Mask Change from the Deck. </span>  <span>The support throughout the deck focuses heavily on quickly getting to the right strategy for the duel with many cards that can quickly search the deck including Masked Hero Dian in the Extra deck who can destroy an opponent's monster to special summon Shadow Mist directly from the deck. </span>  <span>Traditional fusions also feature in the deck providing excellent support with Elemental HERO Sunrise at the forefront immediately bringing Miracle Fusion straight from the deck to the hand while offering a solid second effect and a nice attack point boost to your HEROs. Miracle Fusion can be utilized with the right pieces in the grave to immediately fusion summon Elemental HERO Absolute Zero which if paired with Form Change to summon Masked HERO Acid can wipe the opponent's field or Elemental HERO Gaia which additional to its useful effect can pair with Form Change to Summon Dark Law.

I have been playing HEROs since Stratos came back to 1 in September 2018, three years ago ever since as my main deck. When Stratos was unlimited I played him at three and played 3 e-call. Over time I have realized that he just really does nothing. This came up to me after my friend and I have been playing each other for so long. He used to negate Stratos and I would just combo off afterwards with Faris or fusion destiny that was in my hand. He stopped negating Stratos and waited until I would use faris and negate him. I was then dead in the water unless I drew my 3 of Fusion destiny. If I go Faris first and he negates, what am I going to do with normal summon Stratos? The only real thing I could do is search honest neos and attack if going second. I could search the evil hero if I had one but they too much for 1 card and will probably be reprinted soon. All I am trying to say is that Stratos is not the best normal summon in the deck. I have discovered that Vyon is my favorite thing to normal summon and that I don't even like doing the Faris combo anymore.  Normal summon Vyon send Shadow Mist is essentially the same thing as Normal summon Stratos, they both search any HERO monster. But the kicker is that Vyon has a second effect that you can use immediately after by banishing the shadow mist and searching a polymerization. Which is +1 in card advantage making Vyon so much better. The other notable differences between the two is that Vyon is dark so he can be used to make Dark Law, especially when the opponent uses Effect Veiler or Infinite Impermanence on your Vyon when he uses his effect. Sure you can mask change Stratos too to dodge the negation but you have to make Masked Hero Blast which takes up a whole extra deck slot and just isn't as impactful as Dark Law. Stratos is still a good card and I believe that two in the deck is a good number to run. I love searching a Stratos during combo for a followup in the next turn to blow up my opponents back row, its just so satisfying. He is also a great target for A Hero Lives and it hurts when you have only 1 Stratos and it is in your hand when you want to resolve A Hero Lives using him so I like two. He is also an Elemental Hero which is important when making any of the omni heros with super poly. That is why I prefer 2 Stratos 3 Vyon. As for the other potential normal summons, Liquid and Solid soldiers, I feel like Solid Soldier is just a win more card that is really clunky and I always find myself siding him out every game. Liquid soldier is my favorite card in the deck. I really can't play the deck without him anymore. Liquid being a draw 2 discard 1 twice in one duel gives me so much flexibility. I rarely use his normal summon effect unless I either have to or I am searching mask change with shadow mist turn one which does come up sometimes, especially with the one card combo of Fusion Destiny. So I run zero solid soldier and one liquid soldier.  For the rest of the Vision HEROs, even though I said I don't like the Faris combo anymore, I still opt to run 3 since it is an excellent bait card for handtraps/negates. If they let the effect to place a vision hero resolve then I can sit on the increase and then normal summon vyon and combo off from there. If they target my vyon I can tribute it with increase to dodge the effect and summon another one from my deck. Sure it can't use its first effect again but it can search poly too. The cool thing is if you run two polys you can search them both since Vyon's second effect is a soft once per turn. I don't find myself searching Faris and sometimes don't even use it's second effect if I want to summon anaconda or use super poly later in the turn. Often I am not even able to use Faris' second effect since I draw increase ALL THE TIME!!!! I will never bring increase back to two even if it is a garnet I don't care. I hate seeing the card. It's not like you lose just because you draw it since you can still discard it or use it as fusion material and get it in the grave for the grind. That's why I run 3 faris and 1 increase.  As for the Destiny HEROs, I used to run plasma ALL the time and loved the card. It was my favorite card. As I played when quarantine was over, I found myself never summoning the card and it just being a brick in my hand all the time. I summoned him one time and just got nibirued. It is just such a fragile card that takes too much to make so I cut it. I do miss the card but when Burst of Destiny comes out I will make a deck with it. The rest of the Destiny HEROs in the deck are pretty standard. 2 Malicious 1 Dynatag and 1 level 4. I usually play drawhand but I never really used his draw effect since I never wanted to give my opponent a card so I switched him out for Decider. It's effects can be super helpful in select match ups whereas drawhand is really only good with droll, which I don't have. I have never really used Celestial so he could be a good choice too. The cards are really bricky but Fusion Destiny is too good to pass up.  I run 8 hand traps. 3 Ash 2 Belle and 3 Impermanence. Just my preference since they are 3 very versatile cards that work in many scenarios at locals. 8 is a great amount to open at least 1 which is what I want in this deck. One of my favorite cards in the deck, Super Poly, I run at three. It has been an amazing card for me that has won most of my games. Whether I am fusing both of my opponents monsters in my draw phase going second, Using one of my monsters (preferably liquid soldier to draw two discard 1) and an opponents when they only have 1 big monster/ just don't meet starving venom or mudragon criteria, or using both of my monsters during the battle phase to OTK my opponent. Such a good card, especially since I can just set it going first. You can't do that with cards like lightning storm, Kaijus, or Dark Ruler. I either main deck cosmic cyclone or rivalry, I am still not sure which one. Maybe I should do half and half. My side deck is really rudimentary and mainly just for my locals.  When I win the die roll I usually choose to go first even though my end board is usually just Sunrise Vyon pass. In the past I usually overextended and lost to nibiru all the time. Nowadays I almost never go over 4 summons unless I know my opponent doesn't have Nibiru or I just don't care and can play through it. You can easily OTK using only 4 summons during the main phase in this deck.  The main combo I use is normal summon Vyon send Shadow Mist search Liquid soldier then banish Solid soldier search Poly. If I have a HERO monsters in my hand that I don't need I will use it and Liquid to make sunrise, otherwise I would use the Vyon and Liquid. Chain link 1 Liquid Chain link 2 Sunrise add Miracle Fusion draw 2 discard 1. usually I set some cards and end my turn there if going first. If I need Mask Change and have Fusion Destiny in my hand I will do the combo of making Dangerous with Shadow mist and Malicious then banish mali to summon mali link into cross bring back mali search liquid normal liquid special shadow search mask change set mask change pass turn.  Anyways how I play the deck is basically just using Liquid Soldier as a draw engine to draw handtraps and powerful cards like Super poly to interrupt my opponent and OTK them. I hope you like my decklist and sorry if this explination is rough, I am doing it in one take and not polishing it much. I just wanted to write out whats on my mind and I want to look back at this list in the future when new cards come out and this list will be a memory of past formats. Thanks."

The deck want to go first, if you go second is much harder.  It's a deck based on the structure deck lair of darkness but improved to increase consistency.  The deck is NOT competitive, my aim was to create a decklist that it's new player friendly and can be built without spending a lot.  It's amazing for challenging your friends because you can tribute their boss monsters very easily and with the virus trap you can break their hand.  In a local you can win sometimes but don't have too much hope to win the tournament without a lot of luck.  I know that there are better card for the deck but I wanted to minimize the cost as much as possible.  If you prefeer, you can substitute the two trap trick and metaverse with an additional copy of the other traps.  I like playing also nine-taled fox instead of voivode vampire and dark armed dragon instead of mana dragon zirnitron.

As for the first time ever, we get real support for the gods themselves. However one thing is to be clear: the boar named ""Gullinbursti"" is possessed by Freyr (the god of fertility), and made by the sons of Ivaldi. To it's dismay, the golden boar is very effective at what it is suppose to do (special summon from Hand, and recover a Nordic monster from the GY). Not to mention that since it is a beast monster, it fits well in the Tri-Brigade package that offers expandable ways to get to Thor or swarm your board. The reason that there isn't a whole lot to say about Ivaldi though, is because he himself just searches a Nordic relic on Summon (or special summon if you control a Nordic monster). The Tri-Brigade package fits well with Thor's branch of the Nordic/Aesir archetype as not only they are capable of synergy with the Nordic Beast; but also speak for themselves as they did what they always do best. To my surprise, the real MVP of the Tri-Brigade archetype this time around was ""Rugal the Silver Sheller"". What he does basically is Special summon a (beast/beast-warrior/winged beast) monster from your GY during your opponents turn. This is very effective as to say that you have the new Nordic Relic (Svalinn) on the field, and Thor in your GY; this gives you the opportunity to tribute one of your Nordic beast to your GY to special summon Thor from your GY. As for the rest of the deck, ""Tri-Brigade Revolt"" still holds title as the most situationally important piece of the deck. However this time, I included a Sky-Striker toolkit due to the importance of a card called ""Sky-Striker Mecha - Eagle Booster"" (a card which basically protects your monsters from everything that isn't a Kaiju for a turn). Also included is Triple Tacitcs Talent as hand traps are still the forefront cornerstone to modern Yu-Gi-Oh antics (plus Draw power and hand information is bretty important). For the Extra deck, there isn't whole much to say about it as nothing really changed outside of adding in Thor and Gullveig to the Extra Deck for the Nordic engine to take its course.</div>"

The only thing that varies is the battle effects.  Montage Dragon can end games and easily get 9000 ATK but you probably won't see it much in your hand unless you add Pot of Prosperity (don't recommend).  A lot of search spells. The only spell that can search Montage Dragon is Piri Reis Map but the downside is a turn without any card effect, so just use piri reis to search timelords.  The side deck is filled with floodgates.  Resume: Don't count on Montage Dragon and abuse Timelords effects.  Easy deck hf.  &nbsp;  Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  Any suggestions are welcome.  &nbsp;"

The ""going first"" board is usually ending with two or three negates in the form of Odd-eyes Vortex Dragon (summoned using the effect of Odd-eyes Absolute Dragon), Endymion, The Mighty Master of Magic, Mythical Beast Jackal King and Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess. You can also end with a Secret Village of the Spellcasters up if you draw into it or Terraforming, as well as a Mythical Beast Garuda in hand, which can use three spell counters to negate the special summon of a monster, on SS2.  The following segment shows how to use all of the engines (It's worth knowing that they are in order of importance/the order you will use them in a duel, this is also going first)  First, Mythical beasts. If you opened Mythical Beast Master Cerberus, as well as Mythical Institution, then go ahead and activate Institution. Then activate Cerberus in the pend scale and use it's effect to pop itself (sending it FU to EX deck) to add one Mythical beast to hand. If you opened Jackal King as well, then search Garuda. If not, get the Jackal King. Then use Jackal King in the pend scale, which pops itself to special summon a face up Mythical Beast monster from your EX deck (Cerberus, which can be linked away for gravity controller to free up the EX MZ). At this point, you should have 4 counters on Institution, as it gains 2 spell counters every time a Mythical Beast blows itself up for it's pend scale effect. If you didn't open Spell power mastery (to add servant) or Servant of Endymion, use institution's effect to add Servant to hand. It's imperative that you do not use any Endymion pendulum cards if you wish to use any Mythical beast pendulum effects, as they shut off if they're not the only card in your pend zones. A high Endymion scale (8) works just fine with the Mythical Beast's 4 for summoning 5-7 (which includes Mythical Beast jackal king (lvl 6), and both Endymion TMMOM and Reflection, both 7). At this point, you will want to move onto using your Endymion cards:  The only Endymion card you won't really want to use in the pend scale (unless you're desperate for a high scale or a singular spell counter) is Endymion (TMMOM) himself. His pend scale effect is cool and all, allowing you to use 6 spell counters on your field to special summon itself, and then target and destroy as many cards as you can on the field, up to the amount of cards you control that can hold spell counters (then giving himself the same amount of spell counters as the amount of cards destroyed), but it's a bit of a win more card. His negate is returning a face up card with a spell counter that you control to the hand, to negate the activation and destroy a S/T and then gain the spell counters the bounced monster had (Giving him targeting and destruction immunity from ONLY your opponent's cards). The real MVP's of the deck are Servant, Reflection, and Magister. They all share the effect that they can use three spell counters to special summon themselves from the pend scale along with another monster you can place a spell counter on from your deck (servant's effect), your hand (reflection's effect) and face up from your extra deck (magister). You'll want to put them in the pend scale now, preferably Servant + Magistus or Magistus + Reflection. Keep in mind that all three of these cards can only be special summoned once per turn (which bites you in the a** at the worst points in duels). Then use your spellbook draw engine:  The spellbook engine consists of just 4 cards, Spellbook magician of prophecy, Spellbook of knowledge, Spellbook of secrets, and Crowley, the first propheseer (in extra deck). Depending on the combination drawn, activate Secrets, add Magician, normal Magician and add knowledge, then use knowledge on magician for +2 (as well as +4 counters to all your face up MB monsters and + 2 counters to your endymion scales). Or, Magician for secrets, secrets into knowledge. You can also use crowley for the same thing, if you don't draw the right cards at the start. FYI, Knowledge doesn't work on pendulum spellcaster monsters, as they get sent to the extra deck instead of the GY, where it needs them to go in order to +2  Finally, you'll want to get all your special summons (servant, reflection and magister) and link summons done (such as apollousa, BLS, BS dragon), then pendulum summon as many negates back to your field (being Endymion and Jackal king). It's best to try and get as much usage out of your pendulum summon as possible. The Odd-eyes vortex from absolute combo is simple, Xyz summon Absolute dragon using Endymion and Reflection, then link it off for Mekk-Knight Crusadia or Apollousa, then activate Odd-eyes Absolute's effect, which special summons vortex from the extra deck for free. Don't forget about reflection's effect to bounce both one card you control (with a spell counter) and a card your opponent controls to hand upon it's special summon. This is super handy for putting either Magister or Servant back in your hand to put them back in scale after they've used their effects. Speaking of, Magister has an insane effect, that, during your opponent's turn, you can burn 3 spell counters to special summon a spell counter monster from deck... Pretty crazy!  This deck is incredibly strong, being able to butt heads with some pretty powerful meta contenders, but due to the inherent weaknesses in pendulum-based strategies, brought about by the banning of Heavymetalfoes Electrumite, and master rule 5, it's unfortunately not as strong as decks like VWs or Drytrons. Keep an eye on these cards, however, as they have unbelievable potential!"

This is just the first wave of support and the deck is already pretty good at putting up Towers +3+ interruptions.,"I kinda scoffed at Beetrooper at first, but when people figure out how insane these combos are this deck is gonna see play. New support in the near future is exciting, but what are we playing with right now? You're basically Insect Link Combo, putting up easy endboards with several quality interruptions in a combination of Monster Negates, a Counter Trap, and a lot of searchable hand traps.  Let's go over the deck. Cut it down to 40 cards by shrinking my packages down. It doesn't have as high a ratio of anti-hand trap tech this way, but in exchange, you get more consistent Resonance Insect starts. Seems fair.  So, for starters, we're running 3 Resonance Insect. This plus 1 extender is full combo, and the combo uses all three copies to search 3 times and send 1 time often for a fourth search. These are broken, and are the reason the deck is OP. You want to open this card, and you want at least 1 of your normal summons to be this card when you play out your plays. It is searchable with Gokipole and Retaliating ""C"", and can be equipped to monsters with Picofalena, so you always find 1 throughout your combos.  We're running the Battlewasp engine. Sting the Poison is a good starter - this plus an extender is a decent combo, since you search Arbalest for your extra normal summon with Armor Horn. It also puts a negate on the board when resurrected with Seraphim Papillion or Cicada King, and searches a follow-up in the process, so it is a very good engine to run.  We've got a full playset of Scout Buggy. This is usually the least important starter, it does lead into Armor Horn by itself, but it is more relevant for being special summoned with Invincible Atlas to make Cicada King. Still worth running the 3. You will banish these, but since copies summon from the hand, deck, or GY you want to leave redundant copies in the deck. Very powerful card, a combo piece, and a half-decent starter.  Next onto extenders. 3 Scale Bomber. These chain-block summon effects like Scout Buggy and Sting the Poison, provide an easy extender, and actually represents an additional interruption if you have enough extenders in your hand. 3 Pin the Bullseye and 1 Twinbow the Attacker are generic extenders and Battlewasps to search with Sting the Poison. Twinbow locks you into Insects, but so do your Link monsters which you make early in your combos. You mostly just summon insects so this restriction is not super relevant. We have 1 Monster Reborn. This represents an additional trigger for Resonance Insect sometimes, and while it doesn't combo off with just 1 starter it is a great high-quality extender late into your combos, so I think it is worth it to run. The search off Retaliating ""C"" is also not once per turn, so this is relevant with Monster Reborn. We have 2 Ready Fusion. We run 2 because it is sacky in multiples, and because we run a single Instant Fusion in the deck. That just about does it for extenders.  Beetrooper Sting Lancer is sort of an extender, sort of a hand trap, and definitely an engine card. Number one use for this card is summoning it with the Link 4, but you'll often search the second copy to your hand for more disruption, and when you summon the second copy on your opponent's turn it adds a follow-up. It's a little bit worse going second, but it can also represent an extra (very good) extender when you get hand trapped going first. I think 2 is the right number, I often summon 1 and search the other in my combos. 1 of the Field Spell, for follow-ups and the grind game (it's a decent extender late into your combos and helps keep a Beetrooper on field for the counter trap.) Lastly we run 1 Fly and Sting, the searchable recurrable Solemn in Archetype.  Gokipole is another engine card, but it's actually pretty good to Normal Summon, and fun to discard to Picofalena, so you never mind seeing this card. It is a hard once per turn, so you only get the 1 search off of this card a turn. It can add Retaliating ""C"" in some of your combos, and it adds Resonance Insect in others. You can equip this when you're out of Resonance Insect for more searching. It can also add Aztekipede for an extender, and can summon Killer Needle when you are going second to get an extender and break boards. Doom Dozer is another important card in the deck, but you can summon the one copy multiple times in your combos so you only need 1 (if you see the one, that's great - search something else high level!).  For Hand Traps we have 1 Retaliating ""C"". Pretty good against most strategies, provided they summon using the effects of a spell. Not a knockout in every matchup, but it is searchable, and it is quite good against some of the meta decks, and has applications against rogue decks as well, so you need 1. It can also help with your grind game by being equipped with Picofalena. If Max ""C"" comes back this card will be even more important and worth running a second, especially since the effect is not once per turn. The searching off this card is good, but I think you only need one, since you can shuffle it back into the deck from the GY and then add it again in your normal combos, using this to represent an extra Resonance Insect in your combos basically. We also have 1 Contact ""C"". It is searchable with Resonance and hits tribal decks pretty hard, and can even be searched with Retaliating ""C"". 1 Gadarla. It's searchable, and you need another high-level interactive monster to search for in your combos. Kaijus actually seem pretty good right now, and having the 1 of to search outs a lot of stuff rather nicely. We then have 1 Ash, 1 Ghost Belle, 1 Nibiru, and 1 Imperm. If the Mega Tin isn't out yet you can run more impactful hand traps, but post that you want to run Crossout Designator, and these are the 4 most important hand traps to protect against IMO, just by virtue of 3 of them being very commonly played and the 4th hitting you hard. There are more hand traps in the side deck for games 2-3. Lastly we have 3 Crossout Designator, 1 Called By The Grave, and 1 Instant Fusion for Millenium Eyes Restrict. Beating hand traps is good, and since our deck does require a lot of resources to go in to get them out, beating those hand traps is important. Instant Fusion is also our third copy of Ready Fusion for all intents and purposes, being the final generic extender.  In the extra deck we have some goodies. 3 Armor Horn. When the new support comes out I could see cutting this back to 2, but every copy of Armor Horn you have in the deck improves the grind game of the deck a lot, so right now I'm on all 3. 3 Inzektor Picofalena, these are essential to your combo. They're basically Union Carrier stapled to Pot of Avarice for insect monsters, and you can use that shuffle effect to have insane grind game. I see playing 3 of these as mandatory for your grind game, and so that you can use 2 in your combo going first sometimes, and I'll likely try and fit 3 in even if the new support it really good. We'll see. 2 Invincible Atlas. This is a combo piece and also your main boss monsters, you use this to help put up your final interactions and then leave it in the Extra Monster Zone as this Towers that people have to find an answer for. You could just run 1 and use Picofalena to shuffle the second back into the deck, but I like running 2 for now. You have 1 Seraphim Papillion, you want to make this at the end of your combos with Armor Horn and Sting Lancer (usually) and you want to revive Battlewasp Sting the Poison and in a pinch Scale Bomber to put up extra interruptions on your opponents turn. 1 is fine, you can shuffle it back if you need to and you don't make this turn 2 pretty much ever. 2 Cicada King. Again, Pico could shuffle the first copy back, but I like making 2 of these in a game, and this way Pico can focus on other more important cards. It's a negate, but it actually often represents 2 interruptions thanks to reviving Sting the Poison (or Scale Bomber). We have 1 Accesscode. You'll sometimes be able to make this, but honestly it's not usually where you want to be. It's good for now. 1 Almiraj. Sometimes you just need to use Resonance to search something, lame, but it comes up. Then we have the Fusion targets, Hercules for being and insect, and Millenium-Eyes to protect against hand traps.  Moving on to the side deck, we have an assortment of hand traps, partially for Crossout but also to increase hand trap density in games 2 going second. We have 1 Tri-Brigade Revolt for Crossout as well. It is an extra brick, but being able to use Crossout to shut down Revolt is pretty big in the matchup. We have 3 DRNM, because we want to be able to play the game going second. We have some assorted stuff for backrow, including Pankratops, always flexible. And then we have the 1 Killer Needle to push Gokipole going second.  One thing I want to point out about the deck is that the combos are very flexible. Sometimes it will be correct to summon Doom Dozer twice in a turn in order to build up more interactions, other times you pathway to the most effective plays are to try and search out as many hand traps as possible. You can even discard a hand trap you want to search, like Gadarla, shuffle it back into the deck, and then search it again very reliably. Speaking of, Gadarla is very good. The deck lacks tools to break boards, but easily puts up a lot of good interaction. However, Verte Anaconda can help a lot of those combo players break through your negation by summoning Dragoon, which can then pop what's left of your board, and force you to decide between crashing into it or giving up Atlas' protection on the follow-up. Right now Contact ""C"" is probably better, and since Sting Lancer represents an interruption that grabs you a follow-up it is sometimes the correct choice, but if you know you're in a Dragoon matchup search the Kaiju. Contact ""C"" is actually pretty good against a lot of decks that run Dragoon, for forcing them to go into Dragoon, which you can out. Also, even if your board gets broken you often add enough follow-ups throughout your combos to just rebuild turn 2, so even if they crash into Atlas after poping your board you're in an okay situation. When possible don't search Retaliating ""C"" with Sting Lancer. Generally Retaliating ""C"" is either very good or basically a dead card, and when it is good Sting Lancer is pretty redundant. You can search it when you know spell starters are played, Rokkets, Virtual World, Drytron, etc. It won't be as good against Tri-Brigade now that Tenki is at 1 and Barrage is banned. Lastly, a lot of people write off Scale Bomber's interruption, but when possible don't use it as material, leave it on the field. This will usually be the correct choice for putting up the highest number of interruptions. Don't be afraid discard the Counter Trap to Pico - while ditching an insect is often the better choice (so that you can use Picos second effect), in a pinch this will protect your card advantage, and might be the key to searching the relevant interruptions in your matchup. Also I'm hearing people say in combo tutorials ""Leave Resonance in the GY"" off of Pico's effect. While this is correct when you're going for Doom Dozer combos, when you're trying to maximize your searches it is often correct to shuffle the second resonance back into the deck to draw a card. This secures your follow-ups, letting you use one Resonance in your combo turn 2, since your first send of Gokipole is relevant when you don't see Gokipole, and your second send of Sting the Poison is relevant for setting up a negate on board, but your third send is irrelevant. If the deck gets some good GY enablers this may change, but for now I'd prioritize shuffling 1 Resonance back into your deck for the full combo.  <strong>Combo #1</strong>  So the combo I want to showcase is the Resonance Insect + 1 Extender combo. For our purposes, we're going to use Twinbow the Attacker.  So you normal summon Resonance, and extend with Twinbow (this locks you into insects, but that's not relevant)  Link them into Armor Horn. Resonance Insect Effect, add Doom Dozer  Banish Twinbow and Resonance to summon Doom Dozer  Resonance effect, send Gokipole. Gokipole effect, add your second Resonance Insect.  Armor Horn effect, normal summon Resonance.  Now you link Resonance and Doom Dozer into Picofalena. Pico equips Armor Horn with Resonance Insect, Resonance Insect searches a hand Trap, let's say Sting Lancer.  You could use Pico to draw a card here, but sometimes that messes up with your GY resources, so for the purposes of this tutorial you don't want to do it.  Link into Invincible Atlas. Resonance Insect effect adds hand trap number 2, so lets say that it is Contact ""C"". It could also be a Kaiju.  Banish Resonance + 2 others to summon our Armor Horn again. Resonance sends Sting the Poison.  Invincible Atlas effect, tribute Armor Horn. Here you have a choice. If the counter trap seems good you can summon Sting Lancer. However, since Sting the Poison is in the GY, you can summon Scout Buggy. Scout Buggy Summons a Scout Buggy and make Cicada King in Defense mode.  So our end board just looks like 1 interaction and 1 boss. However, Cicada King summons Sting the Poison for a second (ish) interruption while adding follow-ups, Sting Lancer does a D.D. Crow impression while adding a follow-up, and then you still have 2 cards in your hand plus potentially a draw off of Pico, plus Contact ""C"" or a Kaiju. The combos actually do get crazier from there, and there are games where I've got a hand full of interruptions at the end of my combo.  <strong>Combo #2</strong>  For this one you need Sting the Poison + 1 extender. For our purposes, let's show off Scale Bomber.  So you normal summon Sting the Poison, chainblock its effect summoning Scale Bomber. With its effect, you add Arbalest the Rapidfire.  Link 2 into Armor Horn  Armor Horn effect, normal summon Rapidfire.  Rapidfire effect, special summon Sting the Poison from your GY.  Link 2 into Inzektor Pikofalena, discard 1 card, equip Armor Horn with Resonance Insect.  If you discarded an insect you can shuffle it and everything but Sting back into the deck with Piko to draw a card. This also sets up follow-up plays, but isn't essential to the combo.  Link 4 into Invincible Atlas  Resonance Insect effect, search a hand trap (usually Sting Lancer, sometimes Contact ""C"" or a Kaiju)  Banish 3 Insects from the GY, including Resonance Insect, to summon Armor Horn to the field  Resonance Insect sends Gokipole, which adds Retaliating ""C"".  Invincible Atlas tributes Armor Horn, and either summons Scout Buggy to make Cicada King if Sting is still in the GY, or Sting Lancer to add Fly and Sting.  So your final Board is Atlas with 1 or 2 negates, and at least 2 hand traps, and you only used 1 Resonance Insect to do this. You also naturally search either ""C"" monster throughout this combo.  Note that while this represents the basic routes through the combos, these are also not the peak of the deck. At its best it searches for 5 cards in a turn while putting up Atlas plus 1 or 2 negates.  &nbsp;  This deck is gonna be real, so learn the matchup now before it gets big. I'm not too sure what support Konami intends to release to help this archetype in the near future, but if even half of the new cards are playable it could make the deck a whole lot better. However, it seems really good as a rogue deck in the meta, putting up Towers + several interruptions fairly consistently once you learn the routes. The amount of searching in the deck is incredible, since you can search out multiple Level 5 or higher insect monsters, potentially multiple EARTH monsters with 1500 or less atk (right now we're not built to really capitalize on that but if Retaliating ""C"" becomes really good we could play more) and also once per turn we can search any level 4 insect throughout our normal combos. That's a lot of really generic searching, and there's plenty of decent insect support that exists. Cocoon of Ultra Evolution is a card I think could make it in some situations, if you want to summon weird Insect maindeck boss monsters, or search Resonance Insect an extra time, but I found it not useful enough as an extender to make the cut in my pure list. Still, any 1 strong insect maindeck boss monsters could make that card a viable option. Multiplication of Ants looks good on paper, but actually doesn't help with some of your main combos, so you can skip it.  Some things to look out for with the new support - Maindeck boss monsters (thanks to Coccoon of Ultra Evolution) could change the deck pretty substantially, since on its own Cocoon is mediocre as an extender, but if it searches out an absolute boss it would be worth occasionally having to burn up Scout Buggy. If Maxx ""C"" comes back it is a hit against the deck, as we are a combo deck, but also good for the deck since it is highly searchable in it, meaning more Maxx ""C"" for us. This deck would actually like Maxx ""C"" at 1. since then you could search it, but you wouldn't have to play against it as often. I actually think Maxx ""C"" formats would help the deck in terms of solidifying its gameplan going first and second, and would make Crossout better. Any tools that can help break boards could be pretty substantial for the deck, since it struggles a little bit going second. This is especially true of any extra deck boss monsters, which the deck is sorely lacking. A resource-generating Rank 3 Xyz is something to be on the lookout for in the archetype, since the deck easily makes rank 3s. Any Beetrooper that can Special Summon an Insect from the GY would help. Lastly, one thing that would help the deck a lot are any high-level insect hand traps that get printed, since some hands can search 4 high-level hand traps but there are only 3 (playable) that currently exist, Contact ""C"", Kaijus, and Sting Lancer.  Down to 1 Gokipole. It is an okay starter card in the deck, and it is brickier when you run 1, but I wanted the space to bring back in Called By the Grave to the main. I also put Meteonis Drytron into the side deck for the Drytron matchup."

So this is a control-based deck that grinds your opponent out, your interruptions are usually just Spheres, Sheou and tidying.</span>  <span>• There's also going second cards like super poly and veiler so you can break their boards, but you could honestly cut veiler for forbidden chalice because it can stop vw, tri-brigade and other decks plus forbidden chalice is cheaper. It's just a nice 1 for 1. Rivalry is a great tech for this format since it can stun most of the meta decks out and solemn warning is a nice alternative for solemn strike. The reason why you run Noctovision Dragon is that it's a nice extender that let you dig deeper in the deck and is a target for changeover. It's the same reason for World Legacy Guardragon, but it also lets you link climb into Pisty which could lead to an otk with borrelsword. </span>  <span>• The side is completely changeable, it mostly depends where you play and in what format. I chose what would be best for the format in my opinion. Santa Claws are probably the spiciest one out of them, it's a cheaper alternative for kaijus and not too big that I can't beat over.

LOTD Link Evolution - Barian's Over Hundred Numbers</span>) about the CXYZ 100s Numbers with Barain Hope.  <span>THE KAISER:</span> The main Strat for this deck is to bring out two more monsters for the XYZ summon of utopia double, then use its effect to bring out Utopia Kaiser, which is the only way your bringing out Number 107 Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon(A good beat stick) and its Chaos form Number C107 Neo Tachyon Dragon(Good for securing a lot of damage with its effect to negate and prevent the activation of cards, be mindful that if you have Barain Hope you'll be removing its effect of gaining ATK based on its Overlay Units so don't for get all the time like me.)You'll probably be able to summon another monster if things go right and if you get lucky and draw a Zexal Field/Construction you can add extra Overlay units to the Kaiser, which will let you summon up to three monsters from the extra deck; I usually go with Tachyon Dragon(as mentioned earlier), Battlin Boxer Star Cestus and if you get that extra summons from Zexal Feild, Number C103 Ragnafinity. You wont be able to summon anything else after using The Kaiser so make sure to XYZ summon before using it, Number 104 Masquerade is the best option in my opinion but summon what ever fits the situation.  <span>THE MONSTERS:  <span>The Main cards you'll be XYZ summoning with is usually going to be the Onomat Cards(Zubabancho, Dodododwarf  and Utopic Onomanpoeia.) Goblinbergh and Tin Gold Fish support by bringing in more materials on the field, most of the time before the main Onomat combos and SZ - Ascend Sage will bring more constancy with the rank up cards for the as well as being able to special summon itself if there are no cards on your side of the field.</span></span>  <span>THE SPELLS:<span> The cards Onomatopaira, Onomatopickup(searches for the Onomat Cards) and Zexal Construction(Searches for the Zexal/SZ cards) are to help with the constancy in this deck. Though the Zexal card also has another use, to search for the Zexal card, Zexal Construction must send a card back to your deck, you can use this to your advange if you drew both of your Double or Nothing cards or if you wanna send Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One if you happen to draw it on your first turn.</span></span>  <span><span>      Rank-up-Magic(RuM) Limited Barain' Force and Quick Chaos mostly the best RuMs for this deck, since RuM Barian's force is worse unless your opponet has XYZ monsters, RuM Admiration of the Thousands effect hardly ever gets a chance to activate and RuM Numron Force Negates your all your face up Cards effects(this'll fuck with Barain Hope if you use it while its out.) I haven't used RuM Argent Chaos Force yet but I'll test it out and I might write about it later. Also Rum The-Seventh-One gives some good Heart of the Cards vibes when you draw it in a clutch.</span></span>  Zexal Field is a very useful for its ability to add more Overlay units to a XYZ Summon as well as providing a bit of protection for your XYZ monsters , but you must handle it with care or you could remove a lot of potential options for yourself. By adding cards from your Extra Deck to your XYZ monster you remove the possibility to XYZ summon it or to bringing it out with The Kaiser, and if you add a card from the graveyard, Barain Hope wont be able to copy it's ability anymore since that card is now an Overlay unit. Though, if a card is completely unavailable though XYZ summons or the Kaiser(Neo Galaxy Dragon being trapped in the extra deck due to Tachyon Dragon being destroyed before it could be summoned with RuM Quick Chaos/Resurgam XYZ), you can use Zexal field to put it into an XYZ monster and when that monster is destroyed or used in a Card effect, it will become available for Barain Hope to Copy.  Resurgam XYZ is just kinda there since it's Rank-Up XYZ related and Double or Nothing is required for Utopia double/The Kaiser to work.  <span>The Extra  Deck:<span> Im getting tired so Ima summarize the monsters fast.</span></span>  <span>Number 39: Utopia</span><span>:</span> good utility and if you get Ascend Sage Mid duel, you can draw a RuM card from your deck.  <span>Number 39: Utopia Double</span><span>:</span> Used to bring out the Kaiser.  <span>Number 93 Utopia Kaiser</span><span>:</span> The center of the main strat for this deck, really good beat stick.  <span>Number 101: Silent Honor Ark:</span> It's a decent option if you have extra materials on the field and want another XYZ monster, good monster removal.  <span>Number 103: Ragnazero: </span>A more replaceable card for this deck, it's effect is not allways usable like the other monsters on this list but its only uses 2 level 4 monster for it's materials so it's nice if you want an XYZ monster but you want to save a Utopia summon for later with Ascend Sage and if you don't want to or unable to summon Silent Honor Ark.  <span>Number 104: Masquerade:</span> This card has a very good effect, being able to negate monster effects is really good to keeping your Monster and spells safe. It's second ability can also come in handy sometimes.  <span>Number 105 Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus:</span> It competes with Masquerade for the monster that needs 3 materials to summon so its not a great option in comparison. I usually just summon it with the Kaiser. Although, if this card is in the graveyard and Barain Hope copies it's ability while it only has a little bit of Overlay Units; it can do some good damage against opponents with super big beat sticks or take out some opponents who are low health with monster effects protecting them.  <span>Number 107: Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon:</span> You bring this out with the Kaiser and rank it up next turn and sometimes copy it's effect with Barain Hope. Not much to say.  <span>Chaos Numbers:</span>  <span>Number C101: Silent Honor Dark:</span> Really good card on the field and great affect to copy with Barain Hope, it's ability to attach opponents special summoned cards to itself then summoning Barian Hope on top of it is a really good move, and by itself its just a strong card and one of the best Monster on this list.  <span>Number C103 Ragnafinity:</span> I've never gotten that much use out of this card... It mostly just attach it to The Kaiser with Zexal field and call it a day. It's affect seems pretty decent though but its the same as it's non Chaos counter part in that it's use doesn't come up as often.  <span><a data-name=""Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade"">Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade</a></span>: Being basically a direct upgrade to a good card in this deck, this Monster, to say the least, is great. Also it's basically the only backrow removal in this deck so use it wisely.  <span>Number  C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cetus:</span> It's propose in this deck is similar to its Non Chaos Counterpart so there's nothing really new to say. I also usually summon this with Kaiser.  <span>Number C107: Noes Galaxy Eyes Tachyon Dragon:</span> A powerful card to say the least, it's a really good beatstick and it's card effect is good a securing wins at the end of games if you have a lot of XYZ monsters on your field, though try to remember that it's effect negates Barain Hopes ATK gaining effect, so don't be like me and use it while Barain hope is on the field  &nbsp;  <span><span><strong><span>CXYZ Barain Hope</span></strong></span><span><span><strong><span>:</span></strong></span> The Card that's in the title of the deck, it's can serve as both a beat stick and powerful utility. This card your only gate way to access affects of XYZ monsters that have been destroyed, its also able to become a the strongest beatstick in the deck with enough overlay units. I love this card for the creativity and strategy it want you to use, copy Masqurade to protect yourself form card effects, copy battlin' boxer with little to no overlay units to surprise your opponent with unexpected battle damage, copy Silent Honor Dark to become even stronger while also remove cards from your opponents field, god dam I love this card.</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side Deck:<span> Number wall is iffy protection for your numbers since if your opponents also has a number its kinda useless, it just doesn't feel as useful as it seems. Summoner Monk is a great card but I often have to choose between a spell I need or to use Summoner Monk's effect. Number 102 and C102 are difficult to use since you have to use only light monster to XYS summon 102 and C102's really good effect is locked unless you have 102 as an overlay unit, the card effects are good, just hard to use. Im unsure about Memories of Hope since it's only good if you have XYZ monsters on the field, but I guess you do usually have XYZ monsters on the field, I'm just not sure how many cards are right.</span></span>  I would appreciate if you could suggest card in the comments and thanks for reading my brain vomit about my favorite cards"

Prep of rites helps to grab benten more consistently so you can still use other searches for your fairies for your orange lights. Honest is to pair with Draconids for an instant OTK as long as the person you are playing against doesnt have a way to stop your attack (this is just a back-up play if you get stuck). The honest can also be used with orange light so it is useful either way. Extra deck can be any variation you want (eg, Accesscode and Zeus, Dragoon, all 3 if you wanna flex).  My version runs all the Drytron monsters (except Beta) at 3 of, but you can change the balance of those to fit your playstyle to make room for other cards like Herald of Purple or some hand traps."

CHANCES TO WIN WITH THAT ARE LOW! BUUUUUUUUUT NEVER 0!!!!,"<span><strong><span>This Deck is 100% not for competitive use. Fun only.</span> </strong><span><em>(But if you do end up winning anything, pls tell me!)</em></span></span>  You can theoretically win with this, but it's 1) incredibly hard and 2) it isn't meant for winning. It's meant to have a few laughs with your friends. If you want to have an actually viable deck, check out one of the other ones i made.  If you got any feedback just tell me in either the comments or on Discord (<span>Tobi#5733</span>).  Now having read that you may think to yourself:  ""What in the world am i supposed to do with this piece of ssssshhhhhhhhh!?!?!!?!?!?""  Good question! I mean i would've prefered it if you didnt swear but still.  <span><strong>Now, what are you supposed to do with this?</strong></span>  <span>There are actually a couple ways in which you can play this deck. One would be to just keep flooding the board with monsters and tokens while doing direct damage with the <a data-name=""Cauldron of the Old Man"">Cauldron of the Old Man</a>. You can also troll a bit with <a data-name=""Marshmallon"">Marshmallon</a> and <a data-name=""Snowman Eater"">Snowman Eater</a>. You pretty much want to play almost everything in face down defense position so that your opponent never knows which is which and what he can actually attack and what he has to destroy with his spell and trap cards. But hey, if that's not your style or you just don't want to play the long game, go for an XYZ, Link or Synchro Summon. <a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer</a>, <a data-name=""Raider's Knight"">Raider's Knight</a>, <a data-name=""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"">Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> and <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> are great options and are easy to bring out. They really require almost no setup whatsoever. Having only 4 Tuners in your deck tho means that it's way harder to get to your synchro monsters. Especially <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>. It is still possible. Just like i said, really hard since he's a level 8 Synchro Summon and you only have level 2 and 1 tuners.</span>  <span>The Deck is still WIP so i will change thing's around. I'm really unsure about the three <a data-name=""Smile Action"">Smile Action</a>s for example.</span>  <span>Also this is just a deck i was able to build with the cards i own. So if you're thinking ""Hey wait, why doesnt he use that card instead of this one???"" it's most likely because i dont own that certain card.</span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Update 09.22.2021:</strong>  Full Side Deck and i switched 1 <span><a data-name=""Smile Action"">Smile Action and 1 </a><a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole with 2 </a><a data-name=""Hop Ear Squadron"">Hop Ear Squadron</a><a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">.</a></span>  <strong>Update 09.23.2021:</strong>  Added 2 <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>s to easier bring out <a data-name=""Unchained Abomination"">Unchained Abomination</a>  <strong>Update 09.26.2021:</strong>  Removed 1 <span><a data-name=""Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition"">Number 45: Crumble Logos the Prophet of Demolition, </a><a data-name=""Time Thief Redoer"">Time Thief Redoer and </a><a data-name=""Infernoble Knight Captain Roland"">Infernoble Knight Captain Roland for 2 </a><a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a><a data-name=""Infernoble Knight Captain Roland"">s and </a><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a><a data-name=""Infernoble Knight Captain Roland"">.</a></span>  <strong>Update 10.06.2021:</strong>  Updated text will come soon since im pretty busy rn but i wanted to update my deck real quick."

A fantasy RPG party has assembled, and it's orders are... ASSAULT MODE ACTIVATE!!!","An otherworldly hero saves the world with the Dragon that represents Yusei's willingness to risk his own life to save his friends! Welcome to Brave Stardust Assault mode! These two decks (+ other engines) create the ultimate RPG party to defeat the demon lord (your opponent lol)!  Now with the recent semi-limit of “Emergency Teleport” as of the latest banlist, every “Assault Mode” strategy obtained a power boost with an excellent additional starter. Comboing up to this deck’s boss monster - Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode just became much easier with Brave Token’s “Wandering Gryphon Rider’s” omni-negate. Gryphon Rider, summoned before the Assault Mode combo insulates the line from handtraps and other disruptions.  This harmonious mishmash of cards functions like a mix of combo/control. Going first, this deck ends on several synchro boss monsters and various interruptions (strength of 1st turn board is hand dependent) and going second, this deck can play through interruption and OTK in a heartbeat by generating 8000+ damage by swarming the field - clearing the board with bounce and destruction effects.  This deck is made out 4 separate archetypes/engines.  <span><strong>ASSAULT MODE PACKAGE</strong></span>  The Assault Mode cards adds an extra layer of power to Stardust Dragon, transforming our favourite signer Dragon into a once per turn omni-negate 3000ATK beatstick! The starter for this engine is Psi-Reflector, and it singlehandedly eventually summons this deck’s main boss monster, Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode.  Since Psi-Reflector is the key card, this deck has maximized ways to summon it. x2 Emergency Teleport, x3 Assault Sentinel (searches for Psi-Reflector after tributing), x3 Psi-Reflector itself), x1 Tenki and x1 One for One. That’s a grand total of 10 ways to get Psi-Reflector on the field, Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode a very consistent card.  Once you get Psi-Reflector on the field, search for Assault Beast. Discard Assault beast to get Assault Mode Activate, and use Psi-Reflector’s other effect to summon Assault Beast from the GY. Psi-Reflector modulates Assault Beast’s effect to 7, and you tune the two monsters together for Stardust Dragon! Set Assault Mode Activate, and use it next turn to summon Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode!  <span><strong>BRAVE TOKEN PACKAGE</strong></span>  Brave Token kinda functions as 7 extra copies of “Called by the Grave” or “Crossout Designator.” Wandering Gryphon Rider provides an omni-negate before the 5th summon, allowing the player to play through blowout handtraps like Nibiru. If the Brave Token package successfully baits out a negate, interruption or handtrap, it successfully did it’s job – you can combo off as usual with your other engines. This package searches for it’s starter Rite of Aramesia, then the card eventually gets your Wandering Gryphon Rider out as an omni-negate.  This package has 7 copies of Rite of Aramesia –  x3 Rite of Aramesia itself, x3 Aquamancer of the Sanctuary, and x1 Foolish Burial (Target is Aquamancer which banishes itself to search Aramesia).  Rite of Aramesia activates Journey of Destiny from deck, and it in turn searches out a Brave Token monster. The usual target is usually Wandering Gryphon Rider. It also searches out Brave Token equip cards: Dracoback the Dragoon Steed (targeted bounce), and Noble Arms of Light – Dannel (Attack boost, can be cut out of the deck if needed).  Be aware that if a normal summoned monster uses it’s effect, you cannot activate Rite of Aramesia! On the flip-side, if you use Rite of Aramesia, you cannot use a normal summoned monster’s effect (like your Assault Mode starters Psi-Reflector and Assault Sentinel)!  <span><strong>DOGMATIKA PACKAGE</strong></span>  This package is optional, you don’t have to use it in this deck. I like it because once Stardust Dragon is out, Ecclesia can get you free extra bodies on board or interruption. Nadir’s Servant is an incredible card just gives soooo much relatively free advantage, momentum and destruction as well! This deck does not summon much from the extra deck after completing the Assault Mode combo, so not being able to summon from the extra deck using this package isn’t too bad of a downside. Going first, this package provide interruption and going second, it breaks apart boards.  This package is composed of 7 cards in the main deck (x3 Ecclessia, x3 Nadir’s Servant, x1 Fleurdelis) and x3 cards in the extra deck (x1 Titaniklad, x2 N’tss.) Feel free to add the Shaddol cards to this package as well, I didn’t include them because space in this deck is limited already.  Feel free to swap this out for other packages, handtraps, or staple cards!  <span><strong>ASCATOR PACKAGE</strong></span>  This is the smallest package in this deck composed of only four cards – x3 Ascator, Dawnwalker and x1 Fire Ant Ascator. Unlike the other packages which all have their grindgame and interruption, the Ascator package functions only as an extender, granting it’s user level 8 synchro in exchange for a discarded card. Discarded cards ideally are members of the Brave Token package, since they usually like being sent to the GY. The best generic level 8 synchro target for this engine is Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. In a pinch, this can summon Stardust Dragon as well, if your Assault Mode Package fails.  &nbsp;  With the great variety of different packages this deck features, it’s boards greatly vary. The strength of your first 5-6 cards generally determine the strength of your board. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/Yf7EfgA""><span><strong>HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF THE BOARDS THIS DECK CAN MAKE:</strong></span></a>  As you can see, this deck functions as a grindy control deck that can play/extend through interruption. Each separate engine adds it’s combat style to this RPG party. Assault Mode brings out a big boss monster with an omni-negate. Brave Token clears the field, extra ATK on board, and an omni-negate. Dogmatika provides destruction, extension, extra ATK on board, and a monster negate. Ascator brings out a free level 8 synchro.  While it prefers to go first, this deck can go second, breaking apart the board with cards Nadir’s Servant and Dracoback while extending through plays through 4 engines that provide card advantage (kinda like Dragon Link.)  <span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span>  Ever since the archetype “Brave Token” came out, I kept brainstorming different ways how to utilize the engine with various archetypes, since I’m such a big fan of Fantasy RPG. With this deck, I feel like I’ve created a working RPG party that is ready to adventure through whatever the meta throws at it! 5Ds is also my favourite Yugioh series (after Duel Monsters), so unironically playing Stardust Dragon in a semi-competent deck has a special place in my heart.  Despite the praise I’ve showered on this deck, Brave Assault Stardust is probably only a middling rogue strategy at best, and Brave Token is more optimally used in stronger meta decks like Phantom Knights or Prank Kids. However in my humble opinion, nothing beats the COOL FACTOR of adventuring with a fantasy RPG party with Stardust Dragon to defeat the demon lord (The opponent lol. Forgive me, I’m a big nerd with an overactive imagination)!!!  That’ll be it for now, GLHF Duelists!  &nbsp;"

Using cards that allow you to pick a card from your deck and add it to your hand. Some cards for stalling but also damaging the opponent in the meantime, for example Wave-Motion Cannon and Just Desserts. Nothing special but I think it's extra filthy in some aspects so that's why the name. If I can improve it do comment yeah."

Here's a build with a few cards I don't often see played in Dragons. ,"<span>This deck is intended for online play where Borrelend Dragon is available.</span>  <span>I don't know why but I don't see many Dragon Link players finishing on <a data-name=""Borrelend Dragon"">Borrelend Dragon</a>. Granted it is a very high investment. But crucially it's not just a boss monster; it's an extender! This is hugely important for being able to go into BOTH Borreload Savage Dragon AND Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss on your opening turn. Use it's effect to negate one of your monsters that is going to be sent to the graveyard's effects and get a free Rokket from the Graveyard! </span>  <span>This deck can consistently finish on 3 big boys; Borrelend Dragon, then some combination of Borreload Savage Dragon, Zombiestein, and Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. You usually just need one starter and one extender to accomplish this. </span>  <span>Regarding Tripple Burst Dragon; I always go into it as a link climb into Borrelend Dragon as it's a great card to attach to Borreload Savage Dragon. </span>  <span>Some other cards I haven't seen played too often in Dragon Link, that are in here; </span> <ul>  	<li><span>Dragon Shrine + Galaxy Serpent + World Chalice Guardragon. This represents a free extender with some light attribute grave setup. And none of these cards are hard garnets: Dragon Shrine has other good targets, GS and WCG can both be discarded fodder or in an emergency normal summoned to be linked off into Striker Dragon if you don't have an available normal summon.  </span></li>  	<li><span>Keeper of the Shrine. If you can get this into the GY before you use Rokket Tracer's effect you can use Tracer to destroy a Dragon rather than a spell card and get an additional level 4 body on board. </span></li> </ul> <span>Finally the deck count. I think going for higher deck counts (even 50+) works wonders for Dragon Link. You have so many great starter cards (and any normal summon is basically a starter with Striker Dragon) that having that higher deck count helps keeps garnets out of your opening hand. </span>  &nbsp;"

Having the Danger! engine to dig deeper into your deck + obviously using your Chaos Beasts into getting your Sacred Beasts with the Fallen Paradise combo to dig ever deeper. Having Allure of Darkness is also incredibly helpful as well.  -<strong>The Main theme</strong> of this deck is to quickly draw into your key pieces, to get your combo going with Chaos Summoning or Dark Beckoning Beast. Having the ability to also Foolish Burial or One for One to discard cards to use them for their GY Effects (ie Banishing Dark Summoning Beast to get 1 Sacred Beasts from deck to hand or Banishing Chaos Summoning Beast to get 1 Fallen Paradise from deck to hand). The deck also utilizes Archnemeses Eschatos, Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair, Dark Armed Dragon and Chaos Daedalus incredibly well, since you can easily resolve their effects naturally, with the way the deck plays.  -You will have a graveyard full of dark monsters for your Dark Armed Dragon to be easily summoned, or even if not, you can banish monsters to reduce the size of your GY. The deck may face problems with backrow heavy decks  but Dark Armed Dragon + Chaos Daedalus can easily take care of that with banishing them instead of just destroying them, don't forget that Dark Armed Dragon can spam his banish effect as long as you have Dark monsters in your GY, which you will have plenty, thanks to the Danger! engine that we use.  -<strong>The Extra Deck</strong> utilizes the general staples you're most likely fond of seeing, ie Knightmare Unicorn, Knightmare Phoenix, also using Knightmare Cerberus which I feel people sleep on. Unchained Abomination and Saryuja Skull Dread both offer solid choices that you can pick from + having Pentestag is a nice bonus for piercing. Barricadeborg Blocker and Salamangreat Almiraj both offer some decent utility, especially Almiraj, which can unbrick some shitty hands you may have. The fusions simply exist there as an option, but truthfully, you will rarely go into them, since we're using the Fusion spell once, even though you can search it. Armityle the Chaos Phantasm - Phantom of Fury is still pretty strong if you manage to resolve it. For the XYZ's, we use the Superdreadnaught package + Number 81, but you can easily remove Juggernaught Liebe with something else. Hieratic Sky Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis and Dark Armed, the Dragon of Annihilation are there as a choice, you can also replace any of those with Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star for example or any other staple Link Monster.  -<strong>The Side Deck</strong> is general staples which are there to simply give an idea of what you may want to use. Skill Drain is insane in this deck because you can play through it. You can add/remove things depending on what you face on your locals/friend group etc, the list is simply there as a general rule on what you can use, there are obviously more staple side deck cards which you can utilize, again, depending on what you see fit."

This deck is a going first combo deck focused on getting the Super Quant link monster out and a bunch of Super Quant XYZ monsters to cycle cards, with the option to go into a Great Magnus. </span>  <span>The main starters in the deck are Super Quantal Fairy Alphan, Super Quantum Blue Layer, One-for-one and Emergency teleport. By far the best normal/special summon in this deck is Fairy Alphan, as it allows you to essentially painful choice 3 Super Quantums from your deck, all of which have excellent floating effects. Foolish Burial can also be considered a starter since you can foolish Super Quantum White Layer to guarantee a Fairy Alphan. Unfortunately due to deck space limitations, it is not feasible to run more hand traps besides Ash without ruining the consistency of your plays. Since you will be discarding 5+ cards a turn, it is not ideal to run more hand traps that will inevitably shrink your resources and be discarded without any positive floating effects.</span>  <span>A 9-card danger package is run here because it synergizes very neatly with all of the Super Quantum floating effects, and can also provide as fodder for the link summon of the Super Quant link monster. All the Dangers in this deck also have ideal levels that make them great for XYZ summoning for the Super Quantum cards. Cards like Tsuchinoko and Nessie can go plus off of their own discard effects, and can also be selectively discarded with the use of the Super Quantal field spell, which is the main playmaker of the deck, and is the ideal search in this deck past Fairy Alphan.</span>  <span>Many of the Super Quant spells and traps were cut out because they are too slow and do not contribute to the combo potential of the deck. Conversely, spells such as Pot of Desires and Monster Reborn were added to increase the chances of seeing 3+ XYZ monsters and the link or link + Great Magnus turn one.</span>  &nbsp;"

And Aleister,"I think this is an easy deck for newcomers to try and get caught up with Yugioh without getting completely stomped on. With the new tins coming out soon, the only expensive cards should be Invocation and Nadir. Dogmatika should drop drastically.  <em><strong>Strategy 1</strong>:</em> <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> combo into Shaddoll Winda on your opponent's turn. Mainphase, use Nadir, <strong>send</strong> <strong>Apkallone to graveyard</strong>, add and <strong>send Schism to graveyard</strong>. Activate Maximus's effect to banish and special summon from hand. Activate her effect to <strong>send Ash Dragon and Shaddoll Construct</strong> to graveyard. <strong>Activate Shaddoll Construct</strong> to add Prism trap to your hand and then set and pass turn. <strong>End Phase</strong>, activate Ash Dragon to <strong>add Dogmatika Ecclesia and special summon</strong>. Activate her effect to add Dogmatika Fleurdelis. Fleurdelis can be activated during your opponents turn to negate monster effects. <strong>Finally,</strong> activate Prism trap to special summon Shaddoll Winda.  <em><strong>Strategy 2: </strong></em>Summon Aleister the Invoker and activate effect to add Invocation to hand. Activate Invocation to go into any Invoked monster. Mechaba is good for negating anything if you have the right cards in your hands. The good thing about the Charmers is their attributes, which allows Aleister to go into what he wants.  Tips and Tricks: <ol>  	<li class=""engine-dark-box"">Grand Spiritual Art Ichirin can negate the first monster effect when you have a spellcaster with 1500def on the field. Dogmatika Ecclesia just so happens to be a spellcaster with 1500 def and is a powerhouse for the deck. If you already have Fleurdelis in your hand, that can give you 2 negates.</li>  	<li>Possessed Partnerships can special summon Dogmatika Ecclesia to activate her effect and destroy one face up card on the field. You go +2 and can destroy one of your opponents cards.</li>  	<li>Use Unpossessed in weird ways. You can ram your Jigabyte into your enemy to special summon Dogmatika Ecclesia from your deck. Ecclesia and Jigabyte's effects both activate giving you +2 card advantage.</li>  	<li>The familiar combo. Battle Phase, ram Jigabyte into a stronger monster and destroy it, activate effect to special summon Ranryu from your deck. Ram Ranryu into the same monster to destroy itself and activate effect. Revive Jigabyte and ram into your opponent's monster again to special summon Inari Fire or Nefarious, depending on what you already have in your graveyard. Inari Fire and Nefarious have an endless loop where they can special summon themselves. The only way for them to be stopped is if they are banished or returned to hand or deck. <strong>Getting Inari Fire on the field while you have Nefarious in the graveyard is key. </strong>You don't want to use these two as tributes unless absolutely necessary. Once Inari Fire goes to the GY (Unless destroyed by card effect) it will never be reborn from the GY ever again.</li>  	<li>Use Terraforming and Metaverse to bait hand traps.</li>  	<li>If you draw both Spirit Charmers and Possessed Partnerships, discard Partnerships as you can revive your continuous spells and traps later on.</li>  	<li>If you're playing against decks with different attributes, use the Link Charmer monsters to your advantage. Having both Awakening of the Possessed, Unpossessed, and Grand Spiritual Art make them invisible. And you get to special summon one of your opponents monsters from the GY. Pray you don't get feathered dustered.</li> </ol> Side Deck Tips <ul>  	<li>Trismagistus can special summon level 4 spellcasters, which Familiar Possessed meet.</li>  	<li>I haven't tested Spiritual Light Art yet, but considering you do a lot of banishing extra deck monsters, this may be worth looking into. I assume you can special summon from either banished zone.</li>  	<li>Use Dark Ruler No More to setup your board.</li>  	<li>I forgot to sidedeck the Awakening of the Possessed but they should be worth looking into. If you do decide to add some of them, I advise to increase your deck size, to avoid drawing them on the first turn. At 40, I find I draw them too frequently (even just 1 in the deck). Bad luck perhaps.</li> </ul>"

Welcome to my Six Samurai deck profile! Today, I am going to explain to you how insane this deck really is. Trust no other Samurai deck than this. Any other Samurai deck profile is irrelevant! ^.^ Just kidding! haha.. ha.. But for real listen up yo -.- Do not underestimate the Power of the Samurai, you'll need an entire side deck dedicated to this matchup if you want to stop me :P  Anyway, Kageki and Kizaru 2 card combo is all you need to have a first turn full combo board. Or any spell card and 2 monsters. Or 2 bushido counter cards/spells and 1 monster. Or any 3 monsters. There are a few exceptions but usually, that's what it takes. Anything better than that, you can even play through some negates. Best 5 card hand would be Kageki, Kizaru, Gateway of the Six, Terraforming for Temple of the Six, and a Fire Flint Lady for protection or even another counter card. First turn board should go full combo almost every game, it's ridiculous.  This usually includes unlimited bushido counters on *up to*  4 spell cards, also Battle Shogun can have unlimited counters and your 1 field spell, temple of the six can have unlimited counters, reducing the enemies attack to nothing.  At the end of our first turn. monster/trap/spell/field spell/graveyard/deck/hand will look like this:  Battle Shogun of the Six, with unlimited counters(infinite attack damage). He will deal with high attack monsters.  Apollousa with at least 3200 attack. She will deal with effect monsters.  Naturia Barkion. He will deal with trap cards.  Naturia Beast. He will deal with spell cards.  Abyss Dweller. He will stop any hand traps or graveyard effects.  Grandmaster of the Six. Just a body to fill the last open monster row.  Imperial Order. This will deal with spell cards that Naturia Beast cannot negate, like Dark Ruler No More.  A field spell, Temple of the Six.  2 3 or 4 bushido counter cards on the field.  2o-25 cards in the graveyard.  10-15 cards left in the deck.  6 cards in hand.  &nbsp;  This deck is VERY consistent. You will end first turn with 20+ cards in the graveyard and about 10-15 cards left in your deck. I have drawn full combo 30 shuffles in a row. Still testing the accuracy and I have made some edits after posting this deck list. I added more temple of the six because it never feels like a brick. I have tested over 100 hands. Drawing 2 has never stopped me, it often helps. The deck is more consistent with 3 temple and 1 terraforming. The consistency is the best part about the deck, except the BEAST of a lockdown.  &nbsp;  I run 42 cards instead of 40 because there are NO cards that you specifically need to see in your opening hand. If you don't have Kageki and Kizaru there is no need to worry, there is at least 10 different ways to achieve the same result and you can still do full combo even without opening a single bushido counter card. If you do draw bushido counter spells, you can play through some negates. Temple of the six is amazing, almost as good as Shien's Dojo. Fire Flint Lady helps play through a negate as well. We can bait out a hand trap with Kageki and then go into Fire Flint Lady to continue our combo, so I run 3. Special summon Kizaru and use his affect to add Legendary Secret to the hand to later summon when we get Hatsume. There are a few garnets and other cards you would rather NOT see in your opening hand, so 42 cards help alleviate the ratios, better than a 40 card deck. I have a lower chance of drawing 2 equip spells in a 42 card deck compared to a 40 card deck. Even drawing just 1 of my 4 equip spells is a 1 in 10.5 chance in a 42 card deck. It is a 1 in 10 chance in a 40 card deck. The cards that you would rather not draw opening hand are Hatsume, Fuma, D.D.R., Living Fossil, Divine Sword Phoenix Blade and Infernoble Arms. It is 100% okay if you draw 1 equip spell, drawing 2 can slow you a bit but unless you have a horrible hand it should be okay. There are plenty of situations where drawing Hatsume and Fuma on the first turn is okay as well, but the main strategy is to special summon Hatsume from the deck by using Isolde, sending 3 equip spells to the graveyard. Use her first affect to add a Kageki to the hand. Then use her 2nd affect to summon Hatsume. Chain summon Legendary Secret of the Six Samurai or any other special summon.  Then summon it and Isolde away for Battle Shogun. We then discard 1 card, (the Kageki that we searched off of Isolde) and get Gateway of the Six. Then we use Hatsume's effect to special summon Kizaru from the grave. Search Mizuho with Kizaru affect and add to hand for later. We can then bring out another Battle Shogun for 3 more counters, we next get 2 Kizans special summoned and then we can XYZ for Shadow of the Six Samurai for 3 more counters.. Bring out more Kizans and Grandmaster. Go into a 4 link material Saryuja and draw some cards. Special summon Mizuho with Saryuja's next affect. Finally, we do the Mizuho and Shinai loop combo with Gateway and Battle Shogun. We can then go through everything in our extra deck including all 3 Saryuja summons on our first turn, drawing a ton of cards. We can use all 15 extra deck monsters in 1 turn, very easily if we are not stopped.. I'm talking almost every game, maybe 90% accuracy for full combo if they have no negates. Maybe a 50% chance if they do negate.  &nbsp;  Asceticism is great! It allows for a free special summon. We are trying to get as many free summons as we can. Not many people run it right now but it has never been a bad draw for me. It works with Fuma/Kageki, Grandmaster/Kizan, Hatsume/Mizuho.. Asceticism even works great with Legendary Secret of the Six Samurai. He can copy any samurai's attack power from the grave. So he can copy a Kizaru's attack, to special summon another Kizaru from the deck! It also works very well with Battle Shogun of the Six too because his attack is always changing depending on the number of bushido counters on the field, we can manipulate those counters with Gateway to Asceticism for Kizaru or anyone else. Asceticism works well with Divine Sword Phoenix Blade too, which boosts a monsters attack by 300. You can boost Hatsume or Mizuho to Asceticism for Kizaru! Asceticism is a great way to get Kizaru more active even if it doesn't appear that way at first because no other monsters have 1900 attack. Last, it works well with Gateway of the six, which can use 2 counters to give 500 attack to any samurai monster that you can then Asceticism with. Asceticism can be very good if you get creative with it, even if your deck isn't entirely built off of it. Right now I run 1 asceticism.  &nbsp;  Primathmech is used to search for Imperial Order or another spell if you already have it. The 3 Saryuja allows for a ton of draw power. 1 Battle Shogun is nice but 2 is needed for those final extra 3 bushido counters you need sometimes. Shadow of the Six xyz can get you 3 extra bushido counters. Crystron Halqifibrax ensures a way to get Shien's Squire in case you don't already have him. Shien's Squire allows for Naturia Barkion and Naturia Beast to come out. Basically, once your bushido loop combo is established, you have a way to search for everything you need. The important cards that are searchable are Shien's Squire, Imperial Order, Gateway of the Six, Kizan, Grandmaster, Mizuho and Shinai. You probably won't even need a Mizuho and Shinai combo to do a Gateway loop.  &nbsp;  The biggest weakness to this deck is Nibiru because of course it is. You would need 3 bushido counter cards with counters to play through a Nibiru and continue full combo. Also, if you can destroy my Gateway, I can't do the loops."

Para evitar llegar a esas fases del duelo, lo que buscamos es la rápida invocación en turno 2 o 3 de las fusiones por medio de la carta ""Power bond"" queriendo rematar al oponente normalmente con el ""Chimeratech Rampage Dragon"" tras limpiar el campo con sus efectos, pero lamentablemente en la mayoría de casos no será suficiente. Para esos casos en los que el oponente logro defenderse exitosamente, ya estableció un campo que no podemos atravesar con fuerza bruta o de plano algún efecto nos frena. El objetivo será establecer nuestro propio campo 'defensivo' usando de diana a los dos monstruos XYZ ""Cyber Dragon Infinity"" junto a alguna fusión o link que logres agregar a las defensas para resistir lo mejor posible los turnos consecuentes.  Notas: -Si bien el deck y el arquetipo en general no le gusta tomar el turno 1 del duelo, tiene los recursos para establecer su propio campo defensivo con el cual estorbar al oponente. -Ninguna trampa es poco, 2-3 trampas es ideal, 5 es mucho. -Ante la duda, POWER BOND."

They are also extremely cheap, you can pick up a full megalith core for under 20$ and you can easily get this deck down to 150$ or less by cutting the expensive extra deck monsters like Zeus and Accesscode. They are nice to have, but not mandatory by any means. Also you can nuke your opponent on their turn which is just sick.  <span><strong>Card Breakdown</strong></span>  3 Megalith Phul - This is the single best card in the entire archetype. It does literally everything you can want a card to do within reason. It recurs a ritual monster on summon to lessen the impact of the card deficits that are inherent in ritual summoning while also modulating its level for XYZ plays. Its second effect is even better, allowing you to ritual summon a monster from the deck at spell speed 2. This is insane. You get to special summon a monster from the deck, which is one of the strongest things you can do in this game because it is both searching and field presence, and it being spell speed 2 allows you to bring out Megalith Bethor on your opponent's turn to pseudo-nuke them in the middle of their combo. This guy is both your starter and your ender in most of the 2-3 card megalith combos and it carries the entire archetype on its back.  3 Megalith Ophiel - Ophiel mostly facilitates consistency by searching a Megaltih (usually Phul, but sometimes hagith) and then using itself as the material to summon them. Its also useful in a few combos where you could already search a megalith but using Ophiel as a middleman will make the end result better, usually by giving you an extra Bethor pop or Letting you use Phul's on summon effect to make it level 4.  3 Megalith Hagith - Hagith is the megalith backrow searcher, and while there isnt much of it, its still good enough to be worth searching. You can run 2 Hagith but from my experience you are pretty happy to see this in your opener so its worth the third copy.  2 Megalith Bethor - Bethor is the biggest playmaker Megaliths have. It essentially field nukes your opponent on summon which is always a welcome effect in any deck. It can brick your hands though because it relies on the other megaliths to set it up, so running 3 is not advised.  2 Megalith Aratron - Aratron used to be one of the best cards in the deck because of the hand trap ritual summon but since the block dragon ban finding the resources to use it effectively has become significantly harder. Its still worth playing because it offers solid protection and recycling for your other Megaliths and the spell speed 2 ritual summon can save you in a pinch, but its not the staple it used to be.  3 Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands -  Megaliths don't have a normal summon in their archetype so playing ritual monster stratos is a great boost to consistency and being level 4 makes it useful for XYZ plays with Phul.  3 Senju of the Thousand Hands - Megaliths don't have any ritual spells so Senju is effectively identical to Manju and its worth playing for the same reasons.  8 hand traps - I'm going to break my own unofficial rules here and just say you can run any 8 hand traps by preference. Outside of Nibiru which is risky to run maindeck none of the hand traps have that much synergy with Megaliths so just play whatever.  3 Megalith Unformed - The first effect of Unformed is barely ever relevant but that doesn't matter because the second effect boosts consistency and allows you to start your plays without a level 8 Megalith. Its also an important part of the decks best combos.  3 Dark Ruler No More - It breaks boards going second like nothing else and this deck can't really afford to discard for things like Forbidden Droplet or Super Polymerization. Run this or get steamrolled by Drytron :/  3 Pot of Desires - You only have 2 one-of engine pieces so 3 desires is a no-brainer.  2 Cosmic Cyclone - Cyclone is mostly here to out annoying floodgates like There Can Be Only One and -ugh- Mystic Mine.  1 Treacherous Trap hole - This is for Rafflesia, as a pro tip don't XYZ summon Rafflesia until after you activate Pot of Desires and confirm that this isn't banished.  1 Megalith Emergence - This is what you usually search off Hagith because you can use Emergence to summon a Phul from grave which can use its effect to summon Bethor to nuke your opponent at spell speed 2. After that it gives you a solid grind game.  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  1 Abyss dweller - Its a good floodgate XYZ monster to end your combos on.  1 Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer - Its Castel, this deck can make a rank 4. This bird person was a knightmare before knightmares were a thing.  1 Traptrix Rafflesia - Another rank 4 option to end on, popping 2 cards by sending Treacherous Trap Hole is a very strong disruption but if you can already make a spell speed 2 Bethor it can be a little redundant.  1 Baguska, the Terribly Tired Tapir - The ultimate stalling tactic for rank 4 decks everywhere. If your opponent is winning, make baguska and try to topdeck DRNM.  1 Gallant Granite - Usually not as good as the other rank 4s but its nice to have around because the search can unclog you draws, with megaliths needing at least 2 card to do anything and all that.  1 Number 97: Draglubion - Megaliths can also make rank 8 somewhat easily which makes a Draglubion engine pretty good here as a negate and beatstick or as an otk.  1 Number 100: Numeron Dragon -  For Draglubion.  1 Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy -  For Draglubion.  1 Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder - Its zeus in a deck that can make XYZ monsters. It can be a bit redundant with Bethor, But again, its Zeus.  1 Knightmare Phoenix - Its a knightmare.  1 I:P Masquerena - I had some extra deck space free so i just threw this in because we are playing knightmares. You almost never make it but its there.  1 Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos -  Its really funny to just slam this absolute beast down on someone who forgot to put a dragoon out in their deck and watch them lose.  1 Knightmare Unicorn -  Okay i should probably explain why extra deck monsters with removal effects are so good for the sake of clarity and newer players. Having an answer to your opponent's most threatening cards in the forever accessible extra deck completely removes the luck aspect from whether you can remove things, which is a pretty big deal because then you don't have to play cards like Raigeki so that you have access to removal.  1 Accesscode talker - Having accesscode in your extra deck means you can always generate a ton of damage to otk your opponent and that's why its 100+ dollars and played in basically everything.  1 Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess - Its the best link monster that has the word negate on it, and while again its usually better to just make an XYZ, having it doesn't hurt.  <span><strong>Basic Combos</strong></span>  Phul + Manju/Senju  NS Manju/Senju  Manju/Senju summon ef search a level 8  Level 8 hand ef tributing Manju/Senju to summon Phul  Phul 1st ef add the level 8 back to hand  Phul 2nd ef tributing itself to summon Ophiel from deck  Ophiel ef search Hagith  Ophiel ritual summon ef tributing itself to summon Hagith  Hagith ef search Emergence  Set Emergence  On your opponent's turn, activate emergence summoning Phul from GY  Phul ef tributing the level 8 in hand summons Bethor with 2 pops, or more if you tribute hagith and/or phul from the field even though you dont have to  A level 8 and a level 4 megalith work in place of Manju/Senju  Activate level 8, tributing level 4 to summon Phul  Phul ef add the level 8 back to hand  The combo is the same from there  &nbsp;  Unformed + any megalith except Phul  Unformed tributing the megalith to summon Phul if it is level 4 and Ophiel which searches Phul then tributes itself to summon Phul if its level 8  Phul 1st ef return a level 4 Megalith to hand  Phul 2nd ef tributing the level 4 to summon Ophiel into Hagith if the original Megalith was level 4 or straight into Hagith if it was level 8  Hagith ef add Emergence  Overlay Hagith and Phul to summon Abyss Dweller or Traptrix Rafflesia  Set Emergence  Opponents turn  After you activate XYZ monster's ef detaching Phul  Activate Emergence  Summon Phul from GY  if you have materials in hand to use Phul's effect summoning Bethor you can do so with 2-4 pops depending on the level of the original Megalith and how many materials you have in hand  &nbsp;  Unformed + Manju/Senju  NS Manju/Senju  Manju/Senju ef search Ophiel  Unformed tributing Ophiel to summon Phul  Phul 1st ef add Ophiel back to hand  Phul 2nd ef tributing Ophiel to summon Hagith  Hagith ef add Emergence  Overlay Hagith and Manju/Senju for Abyss Dweller or Traptrix Rafflesia  Set Emergence  On opponent's turn  Activate Emergence summoning Ophiel  Phul 2nd ef tributing itself and Ophiel to summon bethor with 2 pops, or 3 if your XYZ monster has already detatched Hagith to activate its effect  &nbsp;"

(that's why i maximized Chain Resonator instead of Synkron). The Inca engine is a ""1"" card special summon and allows you to have a dark dragon synchro on field nor just a synchro to trigger Chain's eff (it discards a card but searches 1 from the deck, baits Ash and works as an extender as well, since you have a Resonator name on grave).

Why just the two Tenyi Adhara how do you use them? They are not used as an syncrho engine like in other decks but for consistency and recursion they can either be used for verte material turn one or most likely and frequently to banish and recur a banished wyrms, but how? well the tokens are non effect monsters use adhara to reclaim monsters of choice from banished perhaps chosen by your grand sword master previously.  Why the Pheonix enforcer? ecclesia recursion from gy and well its just powerful too.  Why so many Iris? Surprisingly comes in useful more often than you might imagine negation hate from yourself and enemy as well lv8 more on that later.  Why the number 100 package? Very easily accessed otk monster in an lvl 8 spam synchro deck also can use harbinger by itself if need more negation.  Why Chaos? Good xyz material discard extender and the extended  Why so strong on the Desires? One of the few decks it can benefit from both the banishes and draws for example Grand Duke, only thing that desires can potentially put an outright end to if unlucky is killing fusion destiny by banishing its targets  The decks primary combos are straight forward  Dragon Sword + any Wyrm/Swordsoul // Dragon sword in hand add Tai A, summon Tai A banish Dragon sword summon token making either yang zing synchro Tai A send Mo Ye, yang zing sacrifice summon Mo Ye reveal swordsoul or wyrm summon token, synchro grand sword master (atm dont get Mo Ye +1) add tactician send sword soul for tactician for ss summon token make any L10 synchro you wish (based on hand may wish to use search for trap/spell or even banish)  Mo Ye + any Wyrm/ Swordsoul summon Mo Ye reveal swordsoul or wyrm summon token, synchro grand sword master cl1 Sword Master cl2 Mo Ye get +1 first just incase you draw a duplicate add tactician send sword soul for tactician for ss summon token make any L10 synchro you wish  As for those like me who aim to make the deck when the cards are availible yes the tech choices are expensive but very very very easily substituted dont need verte only for consistency on pheonix and most hand traps and coounter traps can be swapped for basic floodgates other tech choices and engines a great thing about swordsoul you can play literally any tech choices because its own engine is so consistent and not particularly reliant on anything but desires may be important for boosting consistency through its ratios."

Not possible, right?","ZW's are for Leo Utopia ray, detach, equip one from deck. With the addition of Pegasus Twin saber, 2 level 4s turn into 2 monster negates. Tornado Bringer and Lightning Blade are just tech cards, if you have the possibility to search another ZW, always add Tornado. It's free targeting protection and, most importantly, 100 more atk than Lightning blade. With 2 of each of the Onomat trio, Utopic Onomatopoeia, Gagagacoat, and Gogogoglove, 3 Utopic Astral Hope, 3 Astral Kuriboh, and 2 ZS - Ascended sage, you have all you need for a great rank 4 engine. The onomat trio, when all 3 are on the field, are essentially 6 lvl 4s. The basic combo with these guys is:  Summon Utopic Onomatopoeia, use effect, Glove and Coat, xyz with Glove and Utopic for utopia double, double detach glove, go into Leo, Leo effect, detach Utopic, equip Twin Saber. Then you use Coats effect, to revive Utopic. And gloves effect to revive itself. Then you xyz (any materials) into ZS - Utopic Sage. You then use Sages effect, ss Ascended sage from the deck. Ascended sage with the left over lvl 4, and here's where you make a decision. 1 Decision goes into utopia, ending on a utopia dragner with 4 materials, or a utopic Draco Future. For the Dragner Route, you go into Utopia with Ascended and the left over lvl 4. Use Ascended (Technically Utopia, since Ascended gives it an extra effect) to search Hyper Rank Up Magic Hope Force, then (NOT USING HYPER) summon Utopia Prime, then use the Rank Up Magic to go into a Utopia Dragner. Then use Dragner, detatch any 2 materials, summon Hope Harbinger (Don't use Hyper Rank Up Magics Gy Effect.) Then, during the opponents end phase, you can use Dragner to summon Heart-eartH Dragon, using Hyper Rank Up's gy effect, to attack itself to it. Then you can use Heart-eartH to banish all of the opponents monsters. Only do this if you plan for an OTK Next turn. Now, for the Utopic Draco Future Route, use Ascended Sage and the leftover lvl 4 to go into Gagagaga Magician, then use Gagagaga Magician with the ZS - Utopic Sage to go into Utopic Future (Only those 2, the monsters on Gagagaga are detatched), then go into Utopic Draco Future. The Route with Dragner ends of 2 Monster negates, and 1 spell negate, and at the ep, banish all of your opponents monsters. With the Draco Future, 3 Monster negates, with the added benefit of taking control of the opponents monster when you negate it on the field with Draco Future.  &nbsp;  And good morning, that was very tiring to read, wasn't it. Well there's more. great... Luckily it's only about 4 cards. The first is Zexal Entrust. This one is just when you need another target to search with Utopic Astral Hope. Basically a fallback. Feel free to remove it, but sometimes it's decent. The 2nd is Chain Summon. This is another one of, just like Entrust. It's for when you got enough cards to go into the Dragner Route, and when you still have enough space, you can use chain summon to summon Utopic Future, since there's no requirement for summoning and it's a rank 1. The 3rd card is Numbers Protect. This is also just another searcher for Utopic Astral hope, really powerful, Omni Negate, definitely a keep. The last card is Zexal Construct. This card is more used to unbrick your hand. In a lot of cases, you may draw cards you don't want to. Those 3 cards are the 2 Double or nothings, and Pegasus Twin saber. Construct sends a card from your hand to the deck, then adds one of a few Utopic Support cards. Most of the time you'll search a ZW, like Tornado Bringer. This combined with the normal combo lines and it being a searchable way to unbrick your hand (Utopic Astral Hope) is AMAZING. And for the Droll &amp; Lock Bird, you can replace that for your hand-trap of choice."

It is preferable to start with Lil-la if possible, as it gives you access to Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost, a card with a useful GY effect.

Sunny's GY effect sends one Evil<span>★Twin monster from your deck, field or hand to the GY to remove a card from the field.

Esto es gracias a que el mazo ya sea siendo turno 1 o 2 tiene bastantes posibilidades de darnos algunos problemas durante nuestros turnos (si no tenemos cartas muy especificas dentro de nuestra estrategia para evitarlo), ya que la cantidad de interrupciones, floodgates y recursos que puede generar son bastante potentes.</span>  <span>Cartas como <strong><span><em>Dimension Shifter</em></span> </strong>y <em>Macro Cosmos</em>, provocan que cualquier estrategia que necesite recursos en cementerio (Drytron, Tri-Brigade, PK, entre otros), no logren hacerse con ellos para continuar sus jugadas o reciclar recursos.</span> <span>Así mismo el control que le generan cartas como <em><strong><span>Thunder King Rai-Oh</span></strong>, <strong><span>Inspector Boarder</span></strong>, <strong><span>Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</span></strong>, <strong><span>There Can Only Be One</span></strong> y <span><strong>Summon Limit</strong></span></em><span><strong>,</strong></span> son bastante útiles, pues todas ellas afectan directamente al oponente. </span>  <span>Del lado de las trampas que ayudan a controlar un poco mas el juego de nuestro oponente tenemos <strong><span><em>Crackdown</em></span></strong>, para robarle un monstruo (starter o extender y de ser posible monstruo jefe) a nuestro oponente e interrumpir sus jugadas; también tiene a su disposición  <span><strong><em>Solemn Judgment</em></strong></span> y <span><strong><em>Solemn Warning</em></strong></span> que junto con <em>Thunder King Rai-Oh</em> evitaran cualquier Special Summon de nuestro oponente, aún si no tenemos a <em>Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo</em> en el campo; siendo de todas ellas Solemn Warning la que representa un mayor problema, ya que esta niega invocación Normal, Flip (lo que es bastante útil ya que hay monstruos que requieren hacer flip una vez colocados para activar sus efectos) y por ultimo pero no menos importante niega Special Summon tanto inherente (<em>Cyber Dragon</em>, <em>Kaijus</em>, <em>Pankratops</em>, etc.), como asistida (<em>Monster Reborn</em>, <em>Tri-Brigade Revolt</em>, <em>Red-Eyes Fusion</em>, <em>Nibiru</em>, etc.).</span>  <span>Para la generación de recursos en caso de no tener una mano tan favorable tenemos las ollas indicadas para esta estrategia que son <strong><span><em>Pot of Desires</em></span></strong><span><span>, </span></span><strong><span><em>Pot of Extravagance </em></span></strong>y <strong><span><em>Pot of Duality</em></span></strong>, siendo Desires y Extravagance quienes potenciaran al monstruo jefe de esta estrategia <strong><span><em>Gren Maju Da Eiza</em></span></strong>, el cual recordemos que se suma 400 ATK/DEF por cada carta baneada (nuestra), y Duality la cual nos puede dar el robo que necesitamos sin arriesgar mucho pues no requerimos tanto la Special Summon.</span>  <span>Ahora bien el Extra Deck tiene 2 funciones, siendo de las principales pagar costo de Extravagance e <strong><span><em>Eater of Millions</em> </span></strong>los cuales requieren banear boca abajo, exclusivamente del Extra Deck. La segunda función viene de la mano de <span><strong><em>Gizmek Orochi</em></strong></span>, que aunque no nos podemos hace de él mas que robandolo; si se tiene el suficiente control en el juego, a la larga podremos hacernos con hasta 2 de ellos en el campo e ir por los <strong>XYZ</strong> que necesitemos según la situación, si necesitamos quitar algún monstruo molesto que no pueda ser destruido por efectos o sea intargeteable, tenemos a <strong><em>Dingirsu</em></strong> o si queremos ir por el OTK tenemos el <strong><em>combo Draglubion</em></strong>, el cual solo se puede detenido si el oponente tiene algo que niegue efectos sin hacer target.</span>  <span>Para finalizar en el Side Deck vemos una carta bastante interesante <strong><span>Super Polymerization</span></strong>, pues con ella podemos deshacernos de algunos monstruos del oponente que representen algo con lo que no podemos lidiar tan fácilmente, esto lo logramos gracias a que por lo regular nuestros oponentes siempre trataran de ir por el duelo y dejar al menos 3 monstruos; y si es el caso que robamos o tenemos en mano <strong><span>Instant Fusion</span></strong>, esto nos facilita un poco lograrlo pues podemos invocar <span><strong>Thousand-Eyes Restrict</strong></span> y con ello conseguir el monstruo que nos pudiera faltar; pero si nuestro oponente no esta listo , podemos equiparnos un monstruo suyo con Thousand-Eyes, despues podemos traer <strong><span>Relinquished Anima</span></strong> con Thousand-Eyes asi ya le enviamos un monstruo al GY a nuestro oponente y con Relinquished Anima le robaremos un segundo monstruo, para así cerrar con Super Polymerization y quitarnos el resto que pudiera tener en campo.</span>  <span>Para conocerlo mejor, solo descargarlo y pruebalo en tu app/programa para jugar YGO! en linea.</span>  <span>Nos vemos y..., Buen Duelo.</span>"

Note that this deck is not very viable in tournaments an,"My first ever decklist!  Someone on Dueling Nexus asked me for this decklist, so I've decided to make one on YGOProDeck. This deck can reliably get out an Borrelend Dragon + a dark level 8 Synchro of your choice while remaining cheap (~$87 on TCGPlayer with a $20 Borrelend for a total of $108). Note that this deck is made as an fun deck for local plays, although you can ""competitively"" play this against top decks by adding staples, expensive cards and a proper side deck.  <strong>Card choices, basic combos &amp; Alternatives</strong>  -3x Black Metal Dragon: Your best starter. Normal summon, then link it into Striker Dragon to add BSL &amp; Darkness Metal. Banish Striker Dragon for Darkness, reborn Black Metal then link into Romulus. Add Dragon Ravine ( or Divine Lance for a free dragon if you already have Tracer in your starting hand) and Wyvern as discard fodder (sometimes synchro material with Romulus' effect). Special summon Tracer (and possibly another Rokket) using your BSL and work toward an Borrelend Dragon + Tracer using Elpy, Quadborrel and Dillingerous Dragon. If you've used Tracer's effect before, use Borrelend to reborn your level 4 Rokket is always an option, but I usually save it for something like an Shelrokket or Silverrokket.  x1 Magnarokket/Shelrokket/Silverrokket/Anesthrokket Dragon: Fun cards, although gimmicky to resolve. Magna provides non-targeting removal, Shel literally ""shoots"" your opponent's monster with an interesting ""fragmentation"" effect, Silver can sometimes win you the game (by banishing your opponent's single copy of Meow-Meow-Mu, etc) and Anes as a free negate. They all float into other Rokkets during the End Phase, providing you the ability to push for game using Borrelsword or powerful level 8 Synchros such as Draco Berserker of the Tenyi. Always replaceable with hand traps if you already have them.  x2 Rokket Caliber: Nice extender that gets your Rokkets in position, also is a free level 4 tuner. This card haven't been released in the TCG though. If released, I think that it won't really change the $108 price of our deck as a common in BODE. (Seriously, I pulled a playset without spending more than ~$5 on 3 packs.) Ditch it for other cards if other players insult you for playing an OCG card.  x3 Forbidden Chalice: Budget replacement of Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplet. Swap them out if you already have one of those expensive cards.  x1 Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend: You won't be using this card regularly, but sometimes this can be more than enough to ruin your opponent's day. Board wipe + Burn, also has nice interactions with Borreload Dragon.  1x Beelze: Fun to beat your opponent.  1x Draco Berserker of the Tenyi: Your worse but cheaper Borrelsword.  1x Firewall eXceed: Can become a cheap 5k beatstick.  -If you have the financial ability, go for 3x <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>+ 1 each of Nibiru and Ash Blossom. This deck dies to Nibiru and Ash and a single copy of Called By The Grave isn't going to help. (If you're broke like us Vietnamese duelists, use proxies to play with your friend. A $100 card is about 1/4 the average monthly salary of us.)  Thanks for reading this! Hope you enjoy dueling with my decklist!  Post-Script: Sorry for my broken English ;-; I'm not very good at writing long guides.  UPDATE: Ditched the Chaos Ruler for an Borreload Savage.  UPDATE#2: Knightmare Unicorn &amp; Chaos Ruler to replace Firewall eXceed and Beelze. Thanks for the great advice!"

It easily synchro climbs into big boss monsters, but there is no nice guaranteed combo. Instead you're forced to rely on a little luck and some good deck building to make your huge boards. However, with that little bit of luck the deck can consistently put Apollo + 2-3 Synchros on the board at the end of turn 1. If you like negating effects a lot this might be the deck for you. It is very good at stealing Game 1s, but doesn't side deck that well. Anyways, let's get into the deck list.  We're a Sekka's Light deck. I didn't really have room to run a lot of spells and traps when I was near the end of deck building, and while you have to side this out often it seems too good to run a better Pot of Greed not to run it.  3 of each Adamancipator Tuner is essential to your deck. When things are going well for you the deck will use all 3 of these in a turn, and really to goal is to use as many of your ""monster maker"" cards in a turn as possible. I can't imagine the deck will ever run fewer than all 9 of these, they are your main starters, your best extenders, and the whole reason the deck is a deck. Rock goodstuff doesn't seem like a deck without them that's for sure.  3 Doki Doki. This is a great hit off of an Adamancipator, a good starter in its own right, and one of the effects you really want to go off in your turn. It's also nice to have level 2 non-tuners for Synchro climbing, and this is the best level 2 Rock monster that isn't a tuner.  We're running the Prank Kids engine to Link climb. One copy of Rocksies results in a Dodo-Doodle-Doo and a Rocksies on the field while adding 2 cards to your hand, one of which is a level 4 EARTH Rock monster, very relevant for some combo plays. What you do with those resources is up to you, but this is another one of those effects you want to get in a turn, and an amazing hit off of Adamancipators, and sometimes a decent starter in its own right. Dropsies and Fansies gives you a little bit of a buffer, and also gives you more ways to turn on your Risen Adamancipators.  Plaguespreader Zombie is a brick for Needlefibre, getting to Link climb into Needlefibre while generating the resources to Synchro climb is really quite good. This card also allows you to stack the top of your deck for your Adamancipator triggers etc, very useful actually, particularly since this deck doesn't require a lot of resources from the hand to combo off, but rather some luck in your hits.  Penguin Soldier is a brick for Penguin Brave, not much to say. You almost never summon this, but you want it for when you need it.  3 Koa'ki Meiru Supplier are our main extender, it's a level 4 EARTH Rock monster that special summons itself, so it's a no-brainer. You can do cool things with the Guardian it searches, so try not to forget this second effect.  3 Koa'ki Meiru Guardian are also obligatory. Hand traps are good, but being able to hit this really puts a hamper on them. The deck makes negates early to stop Nibiru quite easily. It also fills its hand with Rock monsters, so this card can often represent an additional negate. Usually if I hit 7+ negates it is because of a copy or two of this card. Can be a decent normal summon sometimes too.  3 Tackle Crusader. We need level 4 EARTH Rock monsters for the deck. This one does something if you're going second, probably wouldn't be playable in usual circumstances but the deck necessitates a high density of Rock monsters which means we run this card.  1 Gate Blocker, run for the same reasons as above, the absence of playable rock extenders leaves me running any trash that could have upside. Does protect Apollo from Imperm among other things, so this card feels pretty good when it is good.  1 Weeping Idol. It is the wrong attribute, but it is mostly a generic rock extender, and it gives us a fourth level 2 which is actually pretty useful.  3 Madolche Petingcessoeur. It's a generic level 4 extender, run whichever one of those you think has the least downside. I think it is this one, though it does sort of limit you from playing hand traps, so the plan is to side these out when you need Ash.  3 Tenyi Spirit - Adhara. It's a generic tuner you can special summon. Your biggest turns require a little luck and starting with these and and the Madolche monster. It basically only makes Needlefibre, but you want to make Needlefibre, so it is good enough given the limited space Rock monsters occupy. Also not a rock, oh well.  3 Nib. It has fringe advantages over other hand traps in the deck, and is usually high impact in the matchups you need hand traps most. There isn't really space for hand traps in the deck, but we need as many playable Rock monsters as possible and this is, in fact, one of them.  &nbsp;  In the Extra Deck, we have the Prank Kids engine to ""turn on"" Rocksies. Pretty self explanatory, generate a bunch of resources off of one hit. We have Apollo - you're almost always trying to end on this to pile the negates on, very important. We have the two playable Risen Adamancipators - Raptite is occasionally an extra interruption, and a half decent one, but is mostly just an engine card that gives you an extra Adamancipator effect in a turn. Unlike the tuners, it can hit the tuners, so it is pretty decent. Dragite helps break boards and also helps pile on spell negates, and is also important just for being an Adamancipator monster. You try and make this before Apollo to protect her from Imperm. Needlefibre summons Plaguespreader Zombie while link climbing which is important to your combo. Herald, Savage, and Crystal Wing are all your generic boss monsters you make to set up negates. Penguin Brave is interesting in the deck for a couple reasons. You need another Synchro 6 to make for Synchro climbing, if possible it should generate resource, and if possible it should serve as an interruption. Prenguin Brave happens to do all of that pretty well. Sometimes you have to mind your zones and not summon a Penguin with it, and you're mostly just trying to climb it into an 8, but it isn't bad as an interruption in a pinch. Gallant Granite searches you an Adamancipator monster, usually Researcher, helping turn 2 level 4s into Needlefibre + an Adamancipator effect, very relevant to trying to activate all 4 Adamancipator effects in a turn. Abyss Dweller is a good floodgate and worth running for GY matchups. Accesscode and Unicorn are to break boards going second as well as for follow-up plays. I:P is only okay in this deck, but helps put up an extra interruption when your materials don't Synchro together.  &nbsp;  Side decking is weird for this deck. You need a mass of Rock monsters, you want your extenders, and Sekka's Light and the Madolche monster kind of narrow your plays down. You mostly don't really want to side, which makes the deck a lot worse in Bo3. Still, there are a few packages I wanted to run. 3 Anti-Magic Arrows and 1 Red Reboot are here for trap decks - you can absolutely break an average trap board after using anti-magic arrows, and as we don't run other spells and traps aside from the Sekka's Light it is easy enough to side Sekka's light out and just blow out the trap deck. Gamma is a good high-impact hand trap that is fairly generic and doesn't put monsters in the GY for the Madolche monster, so I think these are kind of a must-run. The rest is a crapshoot. I decided DRNM is a good emergency card to have against combo, then I slammed in Ash and Imperm for some more good generic cards you can add in to increase hand trap density if that plan makes the most sense."

One of the win conditions of the deck is of course <a data-name=""Odd-eyes raging dragon"">Odd-eyes raging dragon</a> the problem with that is ... handtraps .  The only thing i would change is maybe switch the dragons mirror for an <a data-name=""allure of darkness"">allure of darkness</a> and the ignister for an bls link or zefra link . Best thing of the deck is that it is consistent altho sometimes bricky . Have fun with it :)"

The Metalfoes are armed with an arsenal of alchemically-enchanted vehicles. From aurum ATVs to argent areial machines. By merging with their rides, these alloyed warriors are able to combat the dangerous dreadwyrm and aid the Dracoslayer in his quest to eliminate the eminating evils.  Burn up the Soul! Metalfoes Fusion!""  The Metalfoes are an interesting deck, being more of a Fusion deck that happens to sue Pendulum monsters. I would say that this would make them somewhat self sufficient and thus resilient to banlist hits...if not for the fact that one of the banned cards was Electrumite.  The general gist here is to use the monsters to create fusions and recur resources and then try to swing for game. Off-themed cards here include: <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: Decent extender given the normal monster focus</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver"">Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver</a>: Which this isn't a pendulum deck per se (in terms of playstyle that is), it does still consist entirely of Pendulum monsters and is a Fusion deck so Vortex fits like a glove. Dissolver and Absolute offer ways to get to Vortex with the former properlly summoning it so that it can be revived if necessary and possible.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""GranSolfachord Musecia"">GranSolfachord Musecia</a>: Closest thing we got to Electrumite and while she can't get you draws she can at least offer some way of fixing scales once you used their effects.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dowsing Fusion"">Dowsing Fusion</a>: more of a meme tech, but since we do play Absolute and since fusing from the hand from the other spells doesn't put them in the ED it is more likely to be live here compared to other Pendulum decks.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>, <a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a>, <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> and <a data-name=""Rescue Hamster"">Rescue Hamster</a>: Normal Monster support and pendulum support, though some do need you to already have a copy on hand to work.</li> </ul> The side deck is purely conceptual. That said with the advent of certain cards, <a data-name=""Engraver of the Mark"">Engraver of the Mark</a> might be a decent budget option. Other possible options include <a data-name=""Greater Polymerisation"">Greater Polymerisation</a> if you want Crimsonite to not be a Vanilla (wont work with the other ones), Some Rank 4s with Goldriver and Hamster/Rabbit (Vimana is out until there is a Level 5 in theme pendulum monster, and even then that is imcomptable with Rabbit) and a Magician engine with Chronogrpah is you want to play it like the average pendulum combo deck. Though I'm not sure if any of these suggestions are good."
