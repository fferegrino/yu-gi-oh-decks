I wanted Dark magician for the nostalgia but i wanted something that would be a little different than the average take. Slamming a Dark Magician, Eternal Soul + Dark Magical Circle engine on top of a Witchcrafter deck seemed like a lot of fun, and i was right.  The main problem i suffered from while playing Dark Magician decks seemed to be monster effects, well-Â  Madame Verre takes care of that all on her own, and if you get grass off, her and Haine have ammo for days. You want to be building your dark magician banish engine asap but its ok to focus on cycling your Witchcrafters, they are basically the base of your strategy providing defense and cover for all of your other cards while you dig.  Navigate is a really fun hit tro bring out DM and WH, straight into your XYZ shenanigans, Chocolate for draw/ defense on top of other cycling and draw effects, its really usually just a matter of hitting grass or starting to hit draw cards to hit off combos.  Selene. is definitely a star of the show but i think the added in synchro paired with the Knightmares give a lot of flexibility; the side deck is just complimentary genarics that i think fit multiple satiations.

This deck build doesn't focus on the OTK of Prime Photon dragon. (Deck was made through TCG Banlist I just transfered it to YGO MD so adjustments can be made that suits OCG banlist more which YGO MD uses.)  The deck focuses on summoning Starliege Photon Blast Dragon, Solflare Dragon, and Number 90: Photon lord for turn 1 and you can even add a Number 38: Hope Harbinger summon if you got a very good hand. (Always leave a photon dragon to your hand if possible for Solflare Dragon's Effect or take Photon Dragon through Number 90's effect on your opponent's turn if you already have Photon Dragon you can take Galaxy Trance for backup.)  For turn 2 you can do the first turn combo but summon Prime Photon Dragon instead of Photon lord. OTK is not always possible in the deck because I only took 2 copies of Photon dragon because I think its one of the major issues why dead draws is being frequent. Though I suggest always do combo's that fits the situation and not recklessly always go for Prime Photon Dragon.  &nbsp;  I always summon Starliege Photon Blast Dragon if possible cause of its meat shield effect that protects my important monsters on the field and if you have an extra Photon Orbital you can even equip it to Starliege Photon Blast Dragon for full protection of your monsters on the field.  I removed rank 5 Xyz summons and took only 2 copies of galaxy soldier because I think it barely goes in to play and most of the time I have one galaxy soldier hanging around on the field I use it for Forbidden Droplet tribute or for Solflare Dragon summon for its toolbox effect. I replaced rank 5 Xyz summons with Twin Photon Dragon because of its special summons and it can even save your normal summon to do more combo's.  &nbsp;  And for the extra deck as the usual either play AA-Zeus or Black Luster Soldier Â· Soldier Of Chaos for late game and the rest is just part of combo's or for the late game.  For the side deck you can replace Galaxy Expedition with a 3rd copy of Trade-In or a 2nd copy of Astral Kuriboh and if you have no Forbidden Droplet you can use Hyper Galaxy instead.  &nbsp;  (I got Platinum 3 (S3) with this deck within 1 week got 6-8 win streaks with the deck sadly I can't play more per day because of school stuff and job.)"

Fluffals, they're a Fusion deck, that does not xeno lock you into anything, which is the best kind of Fusion deck, but also means that it can Link climb (to an extent), and make Xyz plays because they're all of the same Level for the most part.</span> <span>Fluffals, a deck that most people say ""will OTK the shit out of you if you do not know where to hit it"" which after various testings, I do agree.</span> <span>Fluffals, a deck that gave me a reason to play the disgusting <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> engine.</span>  <span>That's Fluffals. Also you'll be seeing a lot of ""Toy Vendor"" but anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ The Fluffals (<a data-name=""Fluffal Dog"">Dog</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Penguin"">Penguin</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Dolphin"">Dolphin</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Bear"">Bear</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Owl"">Owl</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Octopus"">Octopus</a>, <a data-name=""Fluffal Cat"">Cat</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Wings</a>)</strong> - <span>Fluffals, your main deck monsters that you need to uh, you know... play a Fluffal deck. Here's their effects, if you do not know.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Dog - <span>Your main searcher for your Edge Imp Sabres in particular, for some reason, and any Fluffal monster, except itself. It just sucks that it can sometimes miss timing because it's a ""When..: You can"" but so is <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Stratos</a> but, you know... whatever. Clearly a 3 of, as per every main searcher, for understandable reasons.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Penguin - <span>Your main Normal Summon, I think, because having both Penguin and Dog on the field is better than having just Dog. It also lets you draw 2 cards then discard a card upon getting used as a Fusion Material. Both effects are hard once per turns, and also a 3 of.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Dolphin - <span>It recycles your <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> and sends an Edge Imp Sabres or any Fluffal monster from your Deck to the GY, which is crazy good. It also recycles any 1 of your Fusion or Polymerization Spells in your GY or is banished if it is sent to the GY as Fusion Material, which is again, crazy good. Two is fine, I think. You could play 3 if you want.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Bear - <span>Your ""searcher"" for <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>, which is the heart and soul (and sometimes the bane) of this deck for reasons I'll discuss later. It also has an effect to Tribute itself to add back a Polymerization from your GY to your hand, although it targets. You can only use one or the other of its effects for some reason, which is I think the worst kind of restriction in game but I digress.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Owl - <span>I used to play 2 or more copies of this because it searches a Polymerization from the Deck and is a walking Polymerization itself at a cost of just paying 500 LP... until I realized that it has the ""one effect or the other"" type of restriction, so I cut it down to just 1 because it's searchable anyway.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Octopus - <span>This is the funniest card I have read for a Fusion archetype. Upon its Normal or Special Summon, it lets you add back any Fluffal or Edge Imp monster from your GY to your hand, which is neat and pretty normal, but if it is sent to the GY as a Fusion Material, it lets you <strong>return back to the GY up to 2 of your banished monsters</strong>. Usually, this only means that you get to recycle <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a> + another Fluffal banished for its cost, or better yet, it can bring back a banished <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>. We don't have to worry about this interaction yet but in the TCG/OCG, its effect can be used to return back to the GY, a banished <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dasher"">Dasher</a> and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Celestial</a> that you used as Fusion Materials for <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, that you used to draw 2 cards for later use.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Cat - <span>The only reason I gave Cat a slot is because I think 1 Wings is manageable enough and also because recycling a Polymerization instantly after using it is just good to have. Feel free to cut it if you don't like it, but I personally do.</span></span></li>  	<li><span>Wings - <span>The weirdest card in this list, at least I think so, because it does not immediately do anything since it needs a specific set up first of being in the GY alongside another Fluffal monster, having a live Toy Vendor to fully utilize its effects. It's a hard once per turn, and it's a draw 2 IF it completely resolves, but that's a massive IF.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>â¢ The Edge Imps (<a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Chain</a>, <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Sabres</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Edge Imp Scythe"">Scythe</a>)</strong> - <span>Edge Imps, the other half of your monsters that you need to play this deck. There's really nothing much else to talk about Chain because it's the most well known due to it being used as a search engine for generic Fusion decks. Scythe is one of the newest addition to the archetype, it's a hand trap that lets you Fusion Summon during your opponent's Main Phase, including itself. It also has a replacement effect, in case a ""Frightfur"" Fusion Monster(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect by banishing itself instead, which is always great to have.</span></span>  <span>And x3 <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>, because it's a free hand trap, I guess. It could literally be any hand trap you want.</span>  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Frightfur Fusion"">Frightfur Fusion</a></strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a> for Fluffals. Combined with <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>, you could completely wipe out your opponent's entire board or it can turn your <a data-name=""Frightfur Wolf"">Frightfur Wolf</a> into an absolute war machine if you decided to play it. Searchable one of, don't need more of it I think, at least in this version, idk you decide.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>A Fusion Deck needs a Fusion Spell, understandable. We only play two of because it's searchable and you don't want to open too many of it.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Frightfur Patchwork"">Frightfur Patchwork</a></strong> - <span>Your main searcher Spell. Hard once per turn but is a mandatory three of, since it searches and Edge Imp monster and a Polymerization.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a></strong> - <span>Triggers your <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a> search effect. Also a mandatory three of despite also being a hard once per turn because you could always pitch it for <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>A must have one of for any deck that likes having monsters in the GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a></strong> - <span>Reborns a monster, understandable.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Frightfur Repair"">Frightfur Repair</a></strong> - <span>It's nice because it helps you recycle your Frightfur Fusion Monsters from the GY and Special Summon 2 monsters from your GY, one being a Fluffal and the other being an Edge Imp monster. It also allows you to summon 1 Fluffal and Edge Imp monster from your hand by banishing itself from your GY. The only acceptable card in this archetype to have the ""only one or the other"" restriction effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Called By The Grave"">Called By The Grave</a></strong> - <span>Protection. Understandable.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a></strong> - <span>Speaking of the goddamn devil, I have so much stuff to talk about this one because this one's a literal gamble card. Let's start with the pros: It's a draw power at a cost of a discard, which is great if you can manage to pitch specifically either another <a data-name=""Toy Vendor"">Toy Vendor</a>, <a data-name=""Edge Imp Chain"">Edge Imp Chain</a>, or <a data-name=""Fluffal Wings"">Fluffal Wings</a>, because they can either search you a Fluffal or an Edge Imp monster, a Frightfur card, or to just set up Wings to the GY since you can, respectively, and if you draw specifically a Fluffal monster which consists 35% of your main deck since this is a 42 card list, you get to Special Summon any monster from your hand. The problem is that if your drew anything else, you must send it to the GY, which can only be good if you also specifically drew either another Toy Vendor, Edge Imp Chain (or <a data-name=""Edge Imp Sabres"">Edge Imp Sabres</a>), or Fluffal Wings. There's a way to alleviate this, and that is to fix your hand and stack your deck, by using Edge Imp Sabres' effect which thankfully, is a specific Fusion Material needed for <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>. This card... I'm not saying it's bad, in fact I think it's perfectly balanced... perhaps too perfectly balanced, even.</span></span>  <span>We're not playing any traps in this deck btw. If you wanna play <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, go ahead, feel free to do so.</span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>â¢ The Frightfurs (<a data-name=""Frightfur Cruel Whale"">Frightfur Cruel Whale</a>, <a data-name=""Frightfur Sabre-Tooth"">Frightfur Sabre-Tooth</a>, <a data-name=""Frightfur Kraken"">Frightfur Kraken</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Frightfur Tiger"">Frightfur Tiger</a>)</strong> - <span>You'll most definitely be summoning both Cruel Whale and Tiger during your opponent's turn with Edge Imp Scythe. I'm only playing Sabre-Tooth because there's an extra space and I really can't play the DPE engine so the slot for Verte Anaconda is not really that worth it, I think. I mean, you can still play Super Polymerization and its targets even if it's at 2 if you want.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> + <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a></strong> - <span>Self-explanatory free negate engine. Allows you to recycle a WATER monster in your GY if it gets sent there.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢Â  <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> + <a data-name=""Artifact Dagda"">Artifact Dagda</a></strong> - <span>The DPE + Scythe Lock at home, before the DPE + Scythe Lock was cool and when Pendulums were the only one that uses and abuses it. Same principle as its equivalent, but not as better.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton"">Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton</a></strong> - <span>No I am not playing <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>. If you want to be <em><strong>THAT GUY</strong></em>, do it, but not me. Actually to be honest, I think this one's better, because if you or your opponent activates any Spell, it allows you to attach a card of the same card type from your GY as Xyz Material, which is most definitely going to be Toy Vendor, and guess what, if your opponent activates a Spell card, you can negate it by detaching the said Toy Vendor, which also triggers its effect since it got sent to the GY so yeah, screw VFD, play this instead.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> + <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></strong> - <span>Free monster negates that are protected by <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, understandable.</span></span>  <span><strong>â¢ <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a></strong> - <span>Helps Fusion decks in general to either Link Climb, make Xyz plays, or just Fusion spam.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>It should not be surprising. I obviously loved this deck, because first of all, it's a Fusion Deck that can be played either pure or as a toolbox deck. That's always a plus for me because it allows room for deck building creativity. Secondly, it's just as toolbox-y as Shaddolls, and I fucking love Shaddolls for the same reason as the first. And third, I don't know what's with the DUEA era Fusion strategies, or just strategies released in that period in general, man but they just have this level of charm and simplicity to them. They're simple, but not foolproof. They're not complex, but they're not pushovers. They're not straightforward, but not to the point where it gives you choice paralysis. I legitimately think I'll be building this deck too in real life except for the Toad engine because that's still pretty expensive for some reason, all while people are still wasting their money in Branded, which I cannot afford because of the goddamn scalpers but I digress. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

First I apologize for the rambling I wish to only share that I am aware of certain things for my deck.  Cyber Dragon deck that I use in Master Duel and made IRL with my Cyber Dragon deck that I've been slowing putting together for years. I own an Accesscode Talker (was lucky to get the gold version) but I don't own Predaplant Verte Anaconda but I do have plans on trading for a copy. I know of Cyber Revsystem but unfortunately mine got lost in the mail and also have plans on getting it again. I also need more back row removal but can't afford Lightning Storm.  My strategies are: To get Chimertech Rampage Dragon out (Preferably on Power Bond) with Cyber Dragon Seiger as well as Cyber Dragon Infinity, basically hit fast and hard before my opponent can do much. If I can't then I can summon Cyber Eternity Dragon till I can clear my opponent's board."

Even if one of your starting effects get ashed there are usually other things you can do and ways to get your boss machinas or orcust out. Even though the orcust cards lock you into dark machine or just dark monsters that is no problem for Machina Ruinforce going into the next turn since he is dark machine or if you even want to go into Accesscode Talker. The strategy has a handful of ways of setting up your board for disruption. For example, you can end on galatea with machina overdrive set, babel on the field with dingirsu and cymbal skeleton in the gy. Of course you will have to activate overdrive first if you decide to and not the orcust cards first to get the overdrive pop and summon citadel from the deck (or citadel in the gy depending on how you set it up) before you get locked into dark machines and when you do, use cymbal skeleton effect to summon dingirsu from the gy to send an opponents card to the gy or attach an banished machine. In my opinion Machina gearframe, unclaspare, and redeployment are the most important machina cards in the deck since gearframe lets you add a machina like unclaspare, then once unclaspare is added, you use it effect to special summon and send a machina to the graveyard. If you have machina ruinforce or citadel in your hand then dump them with fortress. Go into rank 4 with Gear Gigant, use gigant effect to add Girsu, the orcust mekk-knight, summon fortress from the gy by sending a high enough level machine monster from your hand then link of into galatea and go into your orcust effects after sending an orcust (Orcust knightmare most of the time) to the gy and on your next turn you possibly have enough machine monsters in your gy to go into ruinforce for added otk on your battle phase. Another thing you can do is use the scrap combo which works well if have citadel in the gy. Summon Scrap recycler and send citadel to the gy, send orcust knightmare to the gy by fortress effect, link into Scrap wyvern and use effect to summon back recycler then destroy recycler triggering citadel to summon it, summon scrap golem from the deck then destroy wyvern then use golem effect to summon recycler then send rosenix to the gy, rosenix eff to ss a token, link off into I:P Masquerena (include the token) then intoÂ  Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess. This would however of course with apollousa would be better with a machine monster and overdrive on the field and/or Orcust knightmare in the gy (In which you would have to still have machine monsters in your hand to summon fortress again then link off fortress and knightmare into galatea) to go off into your orcust combos.  Any suggestions and recommendations are welcomed. If there any changes I would make next, I am strongly considering putting in urgent schedule, Heavy freight train derricrane or Express bullet train to make the scrap combo into apollousa more consistent."

This deck can deal with most decks you will find in ranked, as long as they let you go second. Sangan is the second best normal summon that this deck has, most of the time you will search Mekk-knight orange or World legacy chalice, but Maxx c or Ash are great targets when you have enough Mekk-knights already.  Without this deck I wouldn't of been able to get to plat 1 last month, I was playing dinosaur at that time which doesn't match up well against Maxx c or backrow decks and is kind of inconsistent. This deck doesn't really care that the opponent has Summon-limit, Gozen or Skill drain, when you can just hit them with a couple of Mekk-knights each turn and Pot of prosperity for 6 into Lightning storm is always an option. Against good Tri players or Drytron you will need a good hand with specific counters like for Tri (Lightning storm to bait out Revolt and called by for the handtraps they will have drawn), for Drytron (A Kaiju and Lightning storm or Forbidden droplet and Lightning storm)."

Righty Driver Synchro Combo 1</strong> - NS Righty -&gt; SS Lefty (Activate effect to bait Impermance/Veiler) -&gt; LS Halqifibrax -&gt; SS Deskbot 001 -&gt; LS Auroradon -&gt; SS 3 Tokens + Deskbot -&gt; SS Beast-o-Lion (Tribute Auroradon+Token) -&gt; SyS Borreload (Equip Auroradon) + SS Token (Beast-o-Lion effect) -&gt; SyS Herald of the Arc Light End board: Borreload w/ 3 Omni-negate (4050 ATK) + Herald of the Arc Light (Omni-negate + floating effect for Relinquished Ritual Card/Monster)  <strong>2. Righty Driver Synchro Combo 2 (in the case of Beast-o-Lion is in hand since preferably you must never hard draw it)</strong> - NS Righty -&gt; SS Lefty (Activate effect to bait Impermance/Veiler) -&gt; LS Halqifibrax -&gt; SS Deskbot 001 -&gt; LS Auroradon -&gt; SS 3 Tokens + Deskbot -&gt; SyS Baronne de Fleur (3 Token + Deskbot) End board: Baronne de Fleur (1 Targeting Destruction + 1 Omni-negate) + Auroradon (Can be Linked into Accesscode if it survive the opponents turn)  <strong>3. Interrupted Kaiju Combo 1 (Tuner on hand except for Righty Driver)</strong> - Activate Interrupted Kaiju Slumber -&gt; SS Radian on Opponent side, Machine Kaiju on your side -&gt; NS Tuner -&gt; Either go into Baronne/Borreload depending on starting draw Endboard: Borreload+Herald/Auroradon+Baronne  <strong>4. Interrupted Kaiju Combo 2 (No Tuner on hand)</strong> - Activate Interrupted Kaiju Slumber -&gt; SS Radian on Opponent side, any Kaiju on your side -&gt; NS Monster -&gt; LS Verte -&gt; Verte Effect FS Starving Venom Endboard: Starving Fusion Venom Dragon (Non-targeting Destruction for SS'd monsters if destroyed on the field)  <strong>5. Relinquished Bait Combo (If we can Ritual Summon Relinquished with Relinquished fusion in hand)</strong> - RS Relinquished -&gt; Absorb one 1 targetable opponent monster -&gt; Attack or go into MP2 -&gt; Set Relinquished Fusion -&gt; Opponents Standby Phase/Main Phase, Activate Relinquished Fusion -&gt; FS Millennium-Eyes -&gt; if opponent activates monster effect, activate Millennium-Eyes effects to negate and absorb the card (Better to absorb their starter or any problematic cards) Endboard: Millenium-Eyes Restrict (1 Monster Negate)  As stated above, there are a lot of combo lines possible, and you can even combine some of them for a decent end board with 3 negates (<em>Borreload+Herald+Millenium-Eyes</em>) or even OTKs in some cases. Union Driver can bring out Illusionist Faceless as an insurance to allow Relinquished/Millennium-Eyes to bounce back from GY or even equip a <em>Buster Dragon Destruction</em> to any of your boss monster to lock opponents off the Extra Deck.  The deck is <em>very</em> susceptible to <em>Nibiru</em> (as with other combo decks) as we summon a lot of monsters during our turn, though enemies top decking <em>Nibiru</em> if they have only 1 copy is rare, nonetheless the threat is still there. In this case, we can always summon Relinquished last to absorb <em>Nibiru</em>, ending with a big stat stick token, and a 3000 ATK Relinquished.  <em>Ash</em> and <em>Maxx C</em> can be manageable, if we draw into Called by the Grave.  We can also reduce some Kaijus and Tuners to include a few copies of Ash Blossom or add a few more going second cards like <em>Lightning Storm</em> or <em>Evenly Matched</em>.  &nbsp;"

Wind Pegasus: Clears backrow, also has a bounce effect  Light Dragon: Protection for links, SS a link from grave if another cyberse monster deals damage to your opponent  Monster Reborn: I feel like it  Eagle Booster: Good protection  2 Hiyari vs. 1: I love drawing the card and it is a nice extender.

As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>  <span>Edit: I've cut <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> to make room for <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>, because this deck can actually repeatedly Scythe lock your opponent, provided that you have enough LP to do so every turn through <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>.</span>  <span>Another Edit: I've brought back Ukoback because I got a nightmare last night that made me remember that all Barrier Statues not only have different Attributes but also Types, and what do you know, <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Heavens"">Barrier Statue of the Heavens</a> is a LIGHT Fairy. I've also cut Magicians' Souls for testing purposes.</span>"

For the Kali Yuga lock, all you need is Kepler, Swirl Slime, and any other D/D monster in hand, which is pretty easy to get because of the amount of searches this deck (and D/D as an archetype) has.  Kali Yuga lock combo: <ul>  	<li>Summon Kepler, search Dark Contract with the Gate, use that to search a fourth monster. Or, if you already have a fourth via something like drawing with Allure of Darkness, or already have Gate in hand, search Dark Contract with the Swamp King.</li>  	<li>Use Swirl Slime and 1 monster to Fusion Summon Genghis.</li>  	<li>Banish Swirl Slime to summon the fourth monster from hand.</li>  	<li>Genghis procs, summon the monster from GY.</li>  	<li>Summon Dagda, then Gilgamesh.</li>  	<li>Using Gilgamesh, place Orthros and Thomas in pend scales.</li>  	<li>Use Thomas to add Kepler back to hand.</li>  	<li>Use Orthros to pop Thomas and any other card.</li>  	<li>Put Kepler into Pend Scale.</li>  	<li>Pend Summon Thomas, and use Thomas to summon Abyss Ragnarok.</li>  	<li>Using Ragnarok and Thomas, go into Kali Yuga.</li>  	<li>Wait for opponents Draw Phase, pop Scythe, and now you've scythe-locked your opponent with D/D/D.</li> </ul> Pretty big combo but its really easy to do, just a bunch of steps not too much thinking. This also sets up future plays with Kali Yuga to grab Swamp King back from the GY, then use it to Fusion Summon something like Caesar Ragnarok. On turn 3 I've had huge boards set up with this, my best being Caesar Ragnarok, Purple Armageddon, Kali Yuga, Siegfried, High King Genghis, and Abyss Ragnarok. Traded the Purple Armageddon for a second Gilgamesh though, just to be able to get monsters from Field to Grave easier in case anything gets messed up."

Chain block Lubellion's fusion summon effect with Despian Tragedy to bring out Mirrorjade. Use Mirrorjade to banish a monster and send Albion to set Branded in Red in the end phase. In draw phase of the next turn, activate Branded in Red to summon Masquerade using Mirrorjade and Ad Libitum and then re-summon Mirrorjade using the effect of Ad Libitum. 1 banish and a bunch of burn damage if it works out.  Three Kitt in this deck because I'm poor and can't afford Aluber but she essentially serves the same purpose of searching any of the branded spell/traps that you need, also helps cycle some of the garnets back into the deck. Keeper of Dragon Magic does the same except sucks more.  Dogmatika Package helps send the Shaddoll stuff to the grave and adds bodies to the field. Helps send N'tss if needing a pop.  Only one Ash Blossom because I'm poor. The other hand traps help survive. This deck is deathly allergic to spell and trap removal. Monster negates are all up in here though  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"
