Also if you dont have many machines and you wana be more away from that path of machines&nbsp;</span><span>Psychic Fervor is also&nbsp; doubles any damage they take too but you take damage based on its atk before hand. Meaning if its 2700 attack you take that as damage first before it doubles. Most of the time you want at least 1 kaiju in hand and 1&nbsp; leeching the light 1 terraform&nbsp; the field spell or the monster numeron wall and 1 hope spell card this lets you win alot faster. You can also sub out veil for most costy Ashe Blossoms.

The Combo 1kaiju1 viper1hope 1terraform 1 numeron wall this hand is if you a first most of them time you will see this hand with one or two changes honest or Nibiru and you can honest Nibiru if you summon it into attack to trick them, As for going 2ed you will need or hope to draw into a leeching the light for the 6th card and you will kaiju the biggest threat to your deck that has the worse Quick effect to deal with if you cant deal with it hope you have a raigeki or a kaiju slumber also lightning too. Once you kaiju'ed the worse monster you can then use numeron wall or the field spell and get the needed spell card to summon all 3 or 4 gates to one turn kill&nbsp; by using leeching the light cuz that light kaiju will help your numeron team even tho its on their, All of your monsters will gain 3300 attack switch can go up even higher if you have a viper T301 giving them 1200 before you use leeching the light then you can limiter removal and OTK. Also if you have hope in hand use it before you do anything else after you summon all 4 numerons you get 4 cards free.Also Tips you can Leeching the light on Nibiru too, And the other one of vipers if you are forced to play with it you can get two cuz of the token and it will gain that attack. This Decks Main combo has to do with Leeching the light and Kaiju's. Also alot of the meta monster are light too from blue eyes to golden lands to dogmatika and more. Just Remember if they have a light monster you can (leech it!)~</span></p>"

Each Vaylantz card has the ability to special summon themselves from the pendulum zones and some of the cards are based around moving the cards around so you can summon as many Vaylantz as possible. Some of the Vaylantz need the field spells out to special summon so you generally want them out at all times. All the Vaylantz have a pendulum number of 1 so your goal is generally to use Instant Fusion &gt; Couverture + a Vaylantz or 2 Vaylantz to summon Beyond the Pendulum and search Kai-Den (the best high pendulum for this deck because it returns to the hand after pendulum summoning allowing for more Vaylantz stuff.)</p><p>Shinonome is the number one most important card. When summoned it searches a Vaylantz spell (usually the field spell or solo activation) and when moved it searches a Vaylantz monster. Mad Marquess excavates 1-6 cards to add one Vaylantz. Another very good starter if you already have Shinonome. Solo Activation can get both of them out as well as Beyond the Pendulum if you already have Kai-Den.</p><p>Nazuki and Buster Baron are the two Vaylantz monsters that move other monsters on summon which makes them vital for activating Shironome and getting all your Vaylantz out. Senet Switch and Solo Activation from the graveyard are also movement options.</p><p>The Place of Beginning searches your field spells, searches Senet Switch, and can get a Vaylantz from the extra deck to the field. Voltage Viscount also gets Vaylantz from the extra deck to the field.</p><p>Saion isn't always reliable due to the coinflip but can be used to deal with the enemy's monsters. It can negate, halve attack, destroy, or return to the hand. Dominator Duke can stop a trap or spell from being activated and can steal an enemy's monster to be used as fusion material. Both are useful for dealing with the opponent's field.</p><p>Hojo returns a spell or trap to the hand but his main purpose is as a Pendulum Fusion when he gets moved. You generally want to save one movement option to be able to move him. You use him to get out your Vaylantz boss monsters.</p><p>The playstyle of this deck is based all around moving monsters around in order to get out your material and reach your end board. As a result, you generally want to be conscious of where you're placing your monsters and spells at all times. This deck definitely isn't meta but it can be very fun.</p><p>P.S: I added Arrival Cyberse as an out to Mystic Mine.</p>"

You can gain alot of advantage with the Dangers and they can help mitigate weaknesses of the deck espiacially in the cases where you dont open Reinoheart/Perlereino or have a weird combination of Tearlaments that just dont work together also Mothman is a level 4 and Nessie is Aqua. You can also play King of the Swamp in here searching Poly and having a fusion material that can be any name is verry good but in testing it felt that it clogged up my hand more maybe i just got unlucky In the end the deck is verry RNG based which can sometimes lead to cases where you mill 8 cards and cant Fusion summon because you got cucked by RNG and have to sit on a Tearlament i also tried Pot of Desires in this but i just didnt like it you can add it ofc.</p><p>Extra deck is verry flexible with what you can add you can play a good amount of rank 4s im also playing Dweller because in the mirror its a insta pass. For links just use what you like im using Borrelsword because im too poor to buy a accesscode lmao</p><p>For the sidedeck you just use what you want. did you know this deck can play deck dev ? yay fun!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Sure back then it was that efficient until Dark Neostorm and even then the deck is locked to it's own archetype. However, that didn't stop me from playing the deck and overtime I was able to compete against decks such as Prank-kids, Salamangreat, Altergeist, Dinos, Sacred Beast and even against Albaz.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In all honesty, even if the deck wasn't really that good especially since it only locks you into Mayakashi yet&nbsp;to me it was perfect and I'm really happy and proud of myself that I was able to come this far and I'll always forever cherish every moment I had whether it was from building the deck from scratch to even being able to have fun with my friends at locals and overall just having fun playing the deck in general. Mayakashi will forever be my favourite deck of all time and considering I've played this deck for about a solid 4 years in a half, it's time that I put this deck to rest and experiment with other archetypes and potential candidates for a new deck which I do plan on finishing my Speedroid deck which has been on my list for quite awhile and I can't wait to share you guys the deck profile. :D&nbsp;</p>"

Drawing both Avian and Burst is not great, but you can send them to the gy with Fairs or to the deck with cross keeper. Use Infernal to get the two to your hand (after vision hero combo. SS Faris, place increase, SS Increase, SS Vyon) Then from there fuse to get either sunrise or flame wingman (hopefully you have searched liquid solder prior) Normal summon, bring back any hero you can from the gy, make Cross keeper (enough searches would have sent one D-Hero to the gy, otherwise do not make this play). Then search out Neos (if you have not already gotten spirit of neos on the field OR do not have Neos Fusion) Summon Neos Wingman. This also beats over blue-eyes/dark magician/most skill drain decks. (Timelords/malifics are an exception to this as they have more than 3k attack.) Definately not meta but personally fun deck.</p>"

Floodgate your opponent out, and stack their deck to ensure they have no outs!","<p>My take on Floowandereeze in the 2022 August format. The deck is probably the best dumb control deck of the format, unless we count the Mystic Mine tech. The gameplan is simple - Barrier lock people with Wind Barrier Statue, and then control their topdeck while eating their cards with Raiza.</p><p>I decided on 2 Raiza and 2 Empen with 1 Barrier Statue and no Mist Valley Apex Avian. I like the second Raiza, i used to run Earthbound Immortal Rasca to reset 1 copy of Raiza, but honestly decided it was just better to run a second copy of Raiza for that insurance. 2/2 ensures the deck can do it's thing in a grind game. Apex Avian turns you into a deck whose whole gamplan is putting up 1 negate late, and I wasn't sold on it in this version.</p><p>I'm on 3 Robina, 3 Eaglen, and 1 of each of the ancillery Flunders. I figure you don't need Strix or Toccan all that often, and can search them with ease. Toccan might be good enough to run more copies if you need, but I decided to instead run all 4 of the Field Spell, 3 of the Quickplay, and 5 Pots. It is far more important you find a way to see Robina than any other card in the deck, and these consistency enablers help the deck do it more often than not. I think 5 pots is more than enough, although you could consider running more of the Prosperity instead of Duality, I decided the lack of a cost was worth it to enable some extra deck plays for cleaning.</p><p>D. Shifter is pretty standard in Flunder. If you can run this card you probably should, it is a blowout on a hand trap you can activate turn 0. I also decided Book of Moon would make the cut. This card can prevent opponents from making extra deck plays, help push through negations when going second, and also helps to insulate Robina and Eaglen from Imperm/Veiler type effects (with chainblocking helping to deal with Ash Blossom). I decided to main 3 Ultimate Slayer, because I think the card is insanely pushed and really relevant in the current meta, though the 3 copies and the Twins can come out reasonably often, particularly when you know you're going first. I also had room for 2 copies of Infinite Impermanence, usually a better Book of Moon whether going first or second, except that Book of Moon is a defensive card in the shell.&nbsp;</p><p>The Extra deck is mostly bricks for Ultmate Slayer, though there are some blowouts you can make in a pinch as well. Floowandereeze effects prevent you from making these too often, but they will help you clean up and close out games on occasion. Zeus and Accesscode are beasties, and just for fun there's also the Avramax lock with I:P, in case you somehow have 4 monsters and need to stall things out for some reason. I'd probably cut those last 2 if you have any better ideas for the extra deck, but since you usually don't make anything at all the cards are mostly here for Slayer and your 2 Pots.</p><p>The Side Deck is a bunch of going first blowout cards and then cards against Backrow. While winning the coin toss is heavily advised for this deck, I felt it was tuned well enough to go second with just the main, so instead we're focused on really winning those games where we go first.</p>"

This one is influenced by <a href=""/author/supernix-27251"" rel=""nofollow"">SuperNix</a>'s Shaddoll Krawler build, with a few tweaks to give the deck more interruption and going second power. If you find this deck interesting, or my description helpful, please leave a comment and check out the other Krawler decks in this series.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I've said in my other Krawler builds, it is important to understand what the Krawler component of the deck does well, what its weaknesses are, and how the archetype we mix in synergizes with the deck. Krawlers, in general, lack an ability to put up interruption on the opponent's turn, they don't have the strongest end bosses, and they have fairly weak searchability. Krawlers do very well in a grind game, as they can recurse resources and go plus if removed from the field while face-up by the opponent. They also have a great combo enable with Krawler Soma, and a difficult to counter negate in Deus X-Krawler. Shaddolls give us the floodgate that Krawler desparately needs in Winda. Shaddolls are also flip monsters, and syngergize well with Soma's effect to flip a card face-down. Shaddolls also offer us sizable end bosses that are difficut to remove, like El Shaddoll Construct and El Shaddoll Apkallone. So we know how Shaddols cover the weaknesses of the Krawler package, but how do Krawlers help Shaddolls, and is it a stronger partnership than other Shaddoll decks? Krawlers' primary advantage lies in Soma. Soma can put up enough monsters on the board to reliably end on I:P Masquerena and Shaddoll Construct, with a set Shaddoll Schism. This lets us make Winda on the opponent's turn, and either Apollousa or Avramax, depending on what we need. Shaddolls lack a consistent way to trigger their flip effects and swarm the field with monsters, and Krawers fufill both of these conditions! This is fairly strong, though it does lack the puch of Invoked/Shaddoll/Dogmatika builds, and it certainly isn't as flexible as Tearlament/Shaddoll. Still, this list is very powerful, and can play through quite a few interruptions!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This list is fairly large, but there is a lot to fit in, and several single cards and once-per-turn cards that we don't want to draw. We're playing 1 Nibiru, 1 Ghost Ogre, 1 Effect Veiler, 1 Called by the Grave, 1 Dark Ruler No More, and 2 Ash Blossom for our hand traps and spells. Drawing any of these is great, but we never want to draw more than one of each. Also, these are our targets for our 3 copies of Crossout Designator, and the monsters are all bridges for Small World. Speaking of Small World, we're playing 3 copies, primarily to search Krawler Soma, and then to find Girsu, a Shaddoll, or Ecclesia if needed. I will list the bridges at the bottom of the description. We play 2 Mathematicians to send one of our 2 Wendis to grave. The 2 Pot of Desires are our draw spells. We play 1 each of World Legacy Pawns and World Legacy's Mind Meld to set and send off of Girsu, and 3 Girsu as one of our primary starters. For Krawlers, we're on 1 Deus X-Krawler, 3 Soma, 1 Dendrite, 2 Receptor, 1 Glial, and 1 Spine. Shaddolls include the aforementioned Wendi, 1 Beast, 1 Squamata, 1 Genius, and 2 Hedgehogs. We're on 1 main-deck Shaddoll Fusion, for extension and going second, 1 Reesh Shaddoll Incarnation as a flip card, and 1 Shaddoll Schism. The small Dogmatika package consists of 1 Fleur De Lis, 1 Ecclesia, 2 Nadir Servant, and 1 Dogmatika Punishment. Book of Taiyou may seem strange with this deck's ratios, but I will explain the inclusion later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the extra, we have 1 El Shaddoll Shekhinaga for the Earth fusions, 1 El Shaddoll Construct as part of our main combo, 1 Apkallone, and 2 Winda as our primary floodgate. We play N'Tss and Titaniklad to send off of Nadir Servant or Punishment. Our links consist of Accesscode, Apollousa, Unicorn, Phoenix, and Qualiark. Lib the World Key Blademaster searches World Legacy Pawns and is part of our main combo, as is Shaddoll Construct, enabling fusions without a spell. I:P Masquerena is a card we are always looking to end on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What does this deck need to pop-off, and how can we make our bad hands usable? I'll go over combos in the next section, but for now lets look at our starting hand and what we want from it. We want Soma in hand before the combo, no exceptions. Soma and any normal-summonable monster guarantees we at least make Shaddoll Construct and get a fusion off, if not going all the way into Winda with an I:P Masquerena and Construct on field to make Apollousa. Girsu with Soma in hand allows us to perform the same combo, but also ending on Deus X-Krawler with Pawns set. Opening any of our Small World starters guarantees access to Soma, and if we already have soma, searching Girsu/Wendi/Ecclesia. Ideally, we want to perform as much of the combo as possible berfore using Pot of Desires, so as not to banish necessary Small World bridges or Krawlers we hope to summon off of Soma. Mathematician and Soma is full combo after sending Wendi off of Mathematician. Hedgehog and book of Taiyou usually gets us to Winda, as we can search Shaddoll Fusion, and Shaddoll Fusion with at least 1 Shaddoll and 1 other appropriate monster represents a possible way to find Winda. If you open only monsters with no spells and no Soma, don't worry, we still have plays. Girsu on his own can end on Deus X, or he can go full combo if we find a Book of Taiyou. Mathematician and a hand full of monsters is pretty bad, but we can sometimes send Beast to the grave and draw into one of our searchers. Ecclesia can find Nadir Servant, and Nadir Servant allows us to send Apkallone and find Schism while possibly discarding another Shaddoll, allowing us to get a fusion summon off on the opponents turn, and often ending on Winda.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a few of the combo lines the deck has available:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soma and Girsu in hand: Normal Girsu, sending Mind Meld to the GY. Create a token on both fields, then activate Soma in hand, flipping down Girsu. Activate Soma on field, summoning two Krawlers from deck, face-up. Link the two flip-Krawlers into Shaddoll Construct, and activate Shaddoll Construct, fusing it with the face-down Girsu for El Shaddoll Winda. Link Soma and the token for Lib The World Key Blademaster and set World Legacy Pawns to the field. During your opponent's turn, during their Draw Phase or Standby Phase, flip up Pawns and activate Mind Meld in the GY to summon Deus X-Krawler to a zone one of your Link Monsters points to. We can extend this play if we have a Light monster or a Shaddoll in hand. In that case, when you first make Shaddoll Construct, fusion summon El Shaddoll Construct with the Shaddoll in hand and the on-field Shaddoll Construct. El Shaddoll Construct's on summon effect should send to GY Schism/Squamata then Schism, or another name like Hedgehog if you have the Schism in hand. Then link your Soma with the token for Lib, search Pawns, tribute El Shaddoll Construct to summon Shaddoll Construct from GY, and add back the Schism off of El Shaddoll Construct's in GY effect. Activate Mind Meld to summon Deus X, and link Shaddoll Construct with Lib for Apollousa.</p><p>Soma and Mathematician in hand: Normal Mathematician, sending Wendi to GY and summon Squamata off of Wendi (or Hedgehog if Squamata is in hand/banished). Activate Soma in hand, flipping down Mathematician and summoning Soma. Activate Soma on field, summoning two Krawlers from deck, face-up. Link the two flip-Krawlers for Shaddoll Construct, and activate Construct to fuse with the face-down Shaddoll to make El Shaddoll Construct, sending Schism to GY on summon (Resh Shaddoll Incarnation/Beast/Hedgehog if Schism is in hand) and any other Shaddoll card off of the Squamata (Hedgehog). Tribute any Shaddoll in hand, searched off of Hedgehog (send from Squamata), to summon back Shaddoll Construct from GY. Link Soma and El Shaddoll Construct for I:P Masquerena, and add back the Schism (or other Shaddoll card, if Schism is in hand) off of El Shaddoll Construct's GY effect, then set Schism. On the opponent's turn, link I:P and Shaddoll Construct for Apollousa and summon Winda off of Schism.</p><p>Soma and Hedgehog: Normal Hedgehog, then use Soma to set Hedgehog and summon itself. Activate Soma to summon two Krawlers face-up. Link the two summoned Krawlers for Shaddoll Construct, and use Shaddoll Construct to fusion summon El Shaddoll Construct using Shaddoll Construct and the face-down Hedgehog. Add Squamata to hand off of Hedgehog and dump Schism to GY of of El Shaddoll C. Activate Shaddoll Construct in GY to send the Squamata from hand and summon itself, sending Beast or Wendi to GY to either draw or set a card. Link Soma and El Shaddoll Construct for I:P Masquerena, and follow the same finishing plays as the combo above.</p><p>Soma and Wendi/Squamata: Follow the same steps as the combo above, sending Wendi off of Squamata (then summoning Hedgehog off of Wendi), or summoning Hedgehog off of Wendi after fusion summoning El Shaddoll Construct. Off of El Shaddoll C, send Resh Shaddoll Incarnation to GY, then banish Resh and another Shaddoll from GY to flip your face-down Shaddoll face-up. You should have flipped up Hedgehog, so now add Schism to hand. Send the Schism in hand to summon Shaddoll Construct from GY, then link El Shaddoll Construct with the face-up Hedgehog for I:P Masquerena. Add back the Schism off of El Shaddoll Construct, set it to the field, and follow the same steps on the opponent's turn as above.</p><p>Girsu and Book of Taiyou: Summon Girsu, sending Mind Meld to the Gy, and create a token on both fields. Link Girsu and your token for Lib, setting Pawns from deck. activate Mind Mind in GY to banish itself and set Soma to the field. Flip Soma up with Book of Taiyou. Activate Soma to summon two Krawlers, face-up. Link Soma and Lib for Unicorn. If you have a Shaddoll/Light monster in hand, then link the Krawlers for Shaddoll Construct, and fusion summon El Shaddoll Construct by using Shaddoll Construct and the monster in hand. Otherwise, use Shaddoll Construct and Unicorn to make Winda, and end your turn. If you used a monster in hand, send Schism off of El Shaddoll Construct, send El Shaddoll C to GY to reborn Shaddoll Construct, set Schism and link summon Apollousa.</p><p>Mathematician and Book of Taiyou: Summon Mathematician, sending Wendi the GY and summoning Hedgehog face-down. Book of Taiyou Hedgehog, searching Shaddoll Fusion (or Squamata/Beast/Schism if Fusion is already in hand). Use Shaddoll Fusion to summon Shekhinaga if you have no Light/Dark/Shaddolls in hand, and end your turn with one negate on field. If you can use a monster in hand, we have followup. Using a Light in hand, summon El Shaddoll Construct, sending Schism. Link her with Mathematician for I:P Masquerena/Knightmare Phoenix and set Schism. With a Dark/Shaddoll in hand you can make Winda and pass.</p><p>Krawler Receptor and Book of Taiyou: Set Receptor face-down, and use Book of Taiyou to flip them face-up. Search Soma, summon Soma flipping Receptor back down. Activate Soma to summon two Krawlers, face-up. Follow the same steps for the combo above, depending on what your hand has. Worst case, we make Qualiark and pass. Optimally, we can make Winda, or have a set Schism to make Winda, or make Apollousa after summoning El Shaddoll Construct, sending Hedgehog to add a Shaddoll to hand, summoning Shaddoll Construct off of the added card, and linking.</p><p>Ecclesia or Nadir Servant: Either summon Ecclesia to search Nadir Servant or activate Nadir Servant to search Ecclesia. Send the Apkallone to the GY and add Schism to hand, sending preferably a Dark/Shaddoll to GY to make Winda, but a Light/Earth is also passable. Set Schism, set Dogmatika Punishment if you were able to search it, and pass.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesia can always be summoned at the tail end of our combo, just to provide a little bit more negation/disruption on the opponent's turn. We can also use Small World to search for our hand-traps or board breakers, it just depends on what we need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are our Small World bridges: (* are thanks to <a href=""/author/supernix-27251"" rel=""nofollow"">SuperNix</a>) (also, these can be reversed {goal -&gt; bridge -&gt; starter})</p><p>Starter&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Goal<br /><br />any Krawler/Ash/Ogre/Squamata/Beast/Effect Veiler/Fleur&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mathematician&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma *<br /><br />Ash/Ogre/Effect Veiler/Wendi -&gt;&nbsp; Hedgehog&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Girsu *</p><p>Ash/Ogre/Veiler&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mathematician&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma</p><p>Mathematician/Wendi&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Nehshaddoll Genius&nbsp; -&gt; Soma</p><p>Mathematician&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Shaddoll Beast&nbsp; -&gt; Girsu/Ecclesia</p><p>Nibiru&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Ghost Ogre&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mathematician</p><p>Nibiru&nbsp; -&gt; Dendrite&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Mathematician</p><p>Nibiru&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Ecclesia&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Girsu</p><p>Ecclesia&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Beast&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Girsu</p><p>Hedgehog&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Fleur De Lis&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Soma/Math/Nibiru</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a long one! Hope it wasn't too dry. Hopefully this has been informative and motivating for others to make similarly involved descriptions! I think picking a lower-tier deck like Krawler and trying to make it as optimal as possible is a great exercise in deck building and a fun little puzzle! Please let me know what you think, any suggestions or questions you have, and I hope you have a great day!</p><p>As always, the Side deck is a collection of ideas that I couldn't make work. If you can find a way to make these cards viable, or you have other ideas, please let me know!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Plan A is to overwhelm and OTK the opponent. This is achieved through the use of powerful board breaking cards and big beatsticks in easily summonable LV 8 monsters, Numeron Dragon or Gren Maju itself. Plan B is to clear the opponents board to and get access to either 4 material Zeus, allowing two board wipes during the opponents turn, or using other Rank 8's such as Sanaphond to shut off graveyard summoning or Hope Harbinger to negate spells.&nbsp;</p><p>The baord breaking is achieved in many different ways. Kaiju's (Gadarla is still the best choice as Floowandereeze still exists) tackle anything particularly oppressive/non-targetable. Alpha Beast syngergizes so well with Kaiju's due to it's effect that return cards to the Hand/ED (non-targeting I might add as well). As Alpha can special summon itself more than once using its effect, you can loop Gadarla back to the hand, to then Kaiju another particularly troublesome card and then summon Alpha again, depending on what the other cards in you hand are. These two cards alone can eat through several layers of monster interruption quite easily. The Danger cards are really solid. Not only are they big bodies, their board breaking effects on discard also can force negates too. Danger Jackalope is an immense extender for the deck, either facilitating link climbing via summoning itself, or allowing easier access to the rank 8 engine on discard. Ultimate Slayer is one of the best cards that this deck could have hoped for. Being able to return the likes of Mirrorjade to the ED so it's unable to trigger its grave effect (it triggers with Kaiju's believe it or not) is such a great tool, especially combined with N'tss for further board breaks of Garura to draw depending on the situation. Also handy to get rid of links like Halqifibrax if the opponent is relying on Scythe lock can also come up sometimes or Apolussa/Link 5 Borrel if you fail to draw into a Kaiju. The lack of a decent XYZ to send isn't ideal sometimes but still acceptable most of the time. Putting Toadally in simply wastes a ED slot, despite the flexibility the ED has.</p><p>The rest of the deck is dedicated to draw power, pushing through the likes of Ash and other monster effects and D-shifter/mass banishing cards to facillitate OTK's more easily. Gizmek/Pot Of Desires/ Eater mass banish to turbo charge Gren Maju, D-Shifter eliminates Tearlaments quite easily as well as most other decks. Even Spright hates the card, because you totally shut the Toad engine off, and if you break through the opening board they have considerably less resources to follow up with. Triple Tactics and Called By help push through the likes of Ash, Droll and other monster effects and Allure is useful for a draw 2 and to rid the hand of D-Shifter if it ends up not being the most optimal option (it overrides the use of Slayer, so choose wisely.)</p><p>The side deck is roughly the same as it always has been but with some changes. Ra Sphere remains godly against Adventurer/Synchro/Therion reliant decks, as well as being a massive blow against Spright. Heat Wave basically stops your opponent summoning on their turn, which when playing all the decks it works against, almost certainly facillitates an OTK on your next go. 2 Twin Twisters and Reboot are all that is needed against backrow, as there are already so many inbuilt ways to get destroy spells/traps in the deck already. D-Barrier shuts off most lines for the current top decks rapidly reducing the chance of being OTK's to then swing and OTK in return and Deck Devastation Virus is the new way to combat both Splight and Floowandereeze because it's condition to tribute a Dark monster over 2000 atk is laughable trivial for the deck to do.</p>"

Going second this deck can handtrap opponents to slow/stop their strategy, shrug off interruption, clear the board and deal lethal by generating multiple high ATK monsters.<br /><br /><strong>GOING FIRST</strong>, Pure Punk works towards a board that changes depending on what the opening hand is. The ideal board consists of <strong><u>Baronne/Chengying</u></strong>, a <strong><u>LVL 8</u></strong> (Chaos Ruler, Gizmek Orochi, etc.), <strong><u>Sharakusai</u></strong> (Quick Synchro with LVL 8 -&gt; Amazing Dragon bounce up to 4), <strong><u>Halqifibrax</u></strong> (Tag out into Formula Synchron for the draw + Quick Synchro) and a set <strong><u>PUNK trap</u></strong> (Nashiwari Surprise outs things like Mystic Mine and Dangerous Gabu is a monster negate). In addition to the board, you should have multiple handtraps, especially drawn off the effect of Extreme Session. This wide variety of interruption means that if you get Dark Ruler&rsquo;d or Lava Golem&rsquo;d, you still have interruption in your hand and backrow.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GOING SECOND,</strong> Pure Punk can play through a board already weakened by handtraps. This deck has multiple extenders like Emergency Teleport, Foxy Tune, Gizmek Orochi and Extreme Session &ndash; so playing through negates is easy if you have drawn these cards. Uninterrupted, one Punk Ze Amin and a discard leads to a board of Accesscode Talker, Amazing Dragon which is 2 pops, 4 bounces and 8300 damage! &nbsp;<br /><br />There are many PUNK combos, but I&rsquo;ll only be explaining the main PUNK combos for going 1st and 2nd.

Activate Madame Spider&rsquo;s effect to search for PUNK trap. Extreme Session&rsquo;s trigger effect activates to draw one card. Set Trap Card.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The end board should be Extreme Session, set PUNK trap, Sharakusai + Dragon Drive (for Amazing Dragon bounce on opp&rsquo;s turn), and Madame Spider. 2 cards were also drawn with Extreme Session, so your hand may have 1-4 handtraps. Given the right extenders, this board can also end on Halqifibrax, Baronne and Chengying for additional interruption.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This is Pure Punk&rsquo;s bread and butter combo with Ze Amin and a 1 discard.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you already have garnets like Extreme Session, Wa Gon or Madame Spider already in hand, along with Ze Amin access, you can summon Chaos Ruler instead of Dragon Drive. This play enables The Zombie Vampire to mill a total of 9 to your GY to dig for handtraps, Gizmek Orochi and establish an end board with LVL 10 Synchros + Halq.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Careful about putting all your resources in your first turn board, since this format duelists are blinding second or siding/maining board breakers like Lava Golem and Dark Ruler No More! It is advisable to always have follow up (Ze Amin, Emergency Teleport, etc.) for next turn in hand in case your board gets wiped.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>(Going 2nd) Ze Amin + Any LVL 3 PUNK tuner, 1 Discard</strong> = Accesscode Talker (2 pops) + Amazing Dragon (3-4 bounces) and Draw 1+</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normal/Special summon Ze Amin.

Detach from The Zombie Vampire to mill 4 and summon a tuner from GY.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make Halqifibrax using tuner + The Zombie Vampire. Halqifibrax -&gt; Selene -&gt; Accesscode. Pop up to 2 cards on your opponent&rsquo;s field.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"">10. Summon Chaos Ruler from GY banishing a light + dark. Summon from your hand a LVL 3 PUNK tuner using Extreme Session&rsquo;s effect. Synchro Chaos Ruler + LVL 3 tuner to summon Amazing Dragon. Bounce up to 4 cards from your opponent&rsquo;s field.</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"">11. Attack with 8300 on board with Accesscode + Amazing Dragon!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As you can see Pure Punk can OTK in an instant with very minimal resources, even with a mere Emergency Teleport to summon Ze Amin. Clearing the board is a piece of cake too, since the combo above clears up to 6 cards on field before the battle phase. Even without the LVL 3 PUNK tuner in hand, Chaos Ruler + Accesscode is still lethal (8300 DMG) on an empty board.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><ul type=""disc""><li class=""MsoNormal"">If you have an extender like Emergency Teleport or Foxy Tune in hand, try to bait out your opponent&rsquo;s interruption by activating Ze Amin&rsquo;s search effect. She is excellent hand trap bait. Summon Sharakusai from deck afterwards and proceed to full combo!</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">If your opponent is playing a GY-centric deck like Splight, Tearlaments, Tri-Brigade, Sky Striker and etc., careful about using The Zombie Vampire&rsquo;s mill effect. Since it mills their deck as well, you may be helping out your opponent more than you help yourself!</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">If you feel that your opponent will attempt to Dark Ruler/Super Poly/Droplet/Lava Golem etc. you the following turn, leave Psychic End Punisher as the only card left on board. An unaffected gigantic monster is often enough board presence to allowing you to survive and counterattack the following turn!</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">This deck loses hard to common floodgates like Gozen Match, Skill Drain and Mystic Mine. This deck&rsquo;s sides 6 anti-backrow cards specifically for this reason. Also, PUNK Nashiwari Surprise can also destroy backrow.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">While shrugging off most handtraps, this deck is crippled when faced with Droll &amp; Lockbird, Dimension Shifter and Nibiru. D.D Crow hurts as well, since certain cards are needed in the GY for this deck&rsquo;s engine to function.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">When playing vs. a backrow player and going first, have a Sharakusai and a LVL 8 ready to quick synchro into Amazing Dragon. When they set 3-5 backrow, at their end phase, quick synchro into Amazing Dragon to clear their entire field, leaving them at your mercy in the following turn!</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!<br /><br /></a></li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Thank you Konami, for giving my beloved PUNK deck a POT OF GREED, SEARCHER and TWO EXTENDERS with two cards and pushing these cyberpunk performers to meta status. When they put their minds to it, Konami certainly knows how to design cards well to create a competent and entertaining deck! Bravo Konami, bravo, I&rsquo;ll give you a rare congratulations and approval for the Punk support. &lt;3</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">From my personal experience playing Online and in Locals, it is super fun playing piloting Pure Punk. Playing this deck, it&rsquo;s the greatest feeling having a 6 card hand full of handtraps and follow-up at the end of combo. Even if my board gets cleared, I still fire away hand trap after hand trap to stop my opponent in their tracks!</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">(Again, shoutout to <a>Tune World</a> and <a>Pak </a>for their beautiful guides, combos and videos that resulted in the creation of this deck!)<br /><br />I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online and IRL. And with that, I&rsquo;m taking this deck to Locals again this week, wish me luck! That&rsquo;ll be all for now, GLHF Duelists!</p>"

They have a few obvious weaknesses: they rely on flipping monsters face down for control, they have slow special summoning, and they don't have a clear win condition (they have several disparate win conditions). What they do have going for them are some of the most unique spell and trap cards in the game, and some very strong floodgate potential. This deck looks to shore up those weaknesses while capitalizing on their strengths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ghostricks have a weird triangle of win conditions. Ghostrick Skeleton wants to be in a mill deck, and Warwolf wants to burn. Ghostrick Angel of Mischief has a unique alternative win condition, but that isn't what this deck is built to do. This deck's goal is to fill your board, keep your opponent's mons flipped face-down, and attack over 1-2 turns for lethal. I'll explain below the roles that various cards fill, first specifics for the Ghostrick cards, then more general descriptions for the rest of the deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First off, our Ghostrick cards:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 Ghostrick Siren - this card sets up our graveyard for Fairy and Shot and can either search a card or flip a monster face down. Always a plus to draw.</p><p>&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Ghoul - part of our win condition. He can buff up any mon, but he works best with Dullahan. At one because he's searchable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Jiangshi - this card searches our handtraps, either Lantern or Mary. We want to draw him, but never more than one.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Fairy - she returns cards from the GY to the field, but we don't want to open her with no way of setting up the GY, so we only run one.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Nekomusume - the floodgate! This card is incredibly strong once we have our Ghostrick Night on the field. We only need one, as she is&nbsp;&nbsp; searchable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Doll - we use Doll to find Fairy, Nekomusume, and Ghoul. Only at two so we can see more diverse hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Lantern - this effect is incredible, and it puts a body on the field, but we want to find this card off of Jianshi, optimally, not off of our draw.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Mary - this card doesn't prevent damage, but it finds us any Ghostrick from deck! Again, we don't want to see multiples of this card, but I prefer drawing two Mary to drawing two Lantern.</p><p>&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Shot - its one of the best Ghostrick cards, being able to summon back a card and flip another card for added effect, but its a hard once-per-turn, so drawing more than one is undesirable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Parade - we're playing two because its my prefered field spell turn one. Searching any Ghostrick is massive, especially being able to search Mary, then activating Mary after damage. We use this to find enough of our names to get started, then switch to the next field spell.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Mansion - cutting down the damage we take is nice, but this card is primarily of interest so we can attack over the opponent's set cards unimpeded.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Break - not the best opener, as we need a graveyard to take advantage of this card, but getting two summons is no joke, especially for this deck.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 Ghostrick Scare - its not a once per turn. We can selectively flip up our mons to get their effects while flipping down the opponent's starters and cutting them off of further summons. Very clutch card.</p><p>&nbsp; 1 Ghostric-Go-Round - its a nice battle trick, but I should probably cut this one.</p><p>&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Night - the stall effect is incredible on destruction, but the main effect here is what we want. Keeping the opponent's cards locked in face-down defense position enables our whole strategy. We only play one because it is very searchable, but I'm open to playing more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the Extra Deck:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 Ghostrick Angel of Mischief - though I love this card's alternative win condition, we will probably never see it come up. The first effect is what we are looking for: a search for any of our Ghostrick Spell/Traps! Huge to make turn one, and a fairly damaging beater (for this deck) late game.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Alucard - our main bridge into Angel of Mischief. His ability to pop cards is nice, as is his GY effect. Just a good card.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Socuteboss - I've rarely seen her effect go off, but it does happen, and she's a necessary bridge into Angel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Ghostrick Dullahan - our main win condition. This card beefs up pretty big, and is boosted even further from Ghoul. Cutting Atk in half is a decent effect, but this card is primarily a beater.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Ghostrick Festival - it lets us turn any face-down Ghostrick we draw into a potential search, and it turns on our ability to attack directly at all times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Ghostricks in this deck are the engine, the floodgate, and most of the combat tricks. The main goal is surviving the opponent's first turn with a monster or two on board after everything, and having tools ready to lock down their remaining monsters or remove them from the board. We play 2 Lord of the Heavenly Prison to protect our face-down Ghostricks and Spell/Traps, as well as to search a card for our next turn, and occasionally to beat over the opponent's threats. We are playing 2 Tour Guide From the Underworld, and 1 Sangan, to either make a fast Knightmare Cerebus, or to Make Alucard then overlay for Angel of Mischief. Angel will search a card, usually a trap if going first and potentially an extender if going second, then we can link Angel off for Ghostrick Festival, which represents another monster summon. The 2 Battle Faders are a slightly more efficient Ghostrick Lantern, and they can be used to make Dulluhan. We play 3 Allure of Darkness, because we need the draw power, and all of our monsters are Dark. The 2 Calamity Upon the Hidden City work very well with the deck. It protects our cards, floats on destruction, and most importantly, makes monsters flipped face-up VERY big. The 1500 Atk and Def buff is huge, and getting two Calamity's on board makes that go up to 3000. This is especially valuable in finishing off the opponent before they can find their cards that out our floodgate. Since our deck is exceptionally weak to link monsters, we play 3 Drowning Mirror Force, which also synergize with our Field Spells. The 2 Trap Tricks are here to search Drowning Mirror Force, Ghostrick Break, or Ghostrick Scare, depending on what is needed, and again we're on two because of the hard once-per-turn restriction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the extra we're playing the usual suspects. Zeus is very easy to make when we can attack directly and ignore our opponent's monsters. Accesscode and Apollousa need no explaination, and the Knighmares are just good removal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully this has been an interesting take on the deck, and I'd really appreciate any comments you have! Thanks for reading all of this!</p>"

We're trying to let people combo off and then just eat them. 3 Imperm and 3 Droplets are a good start to this, with Imperm being a sort of power card even when not used as a forbidden card, and Droplet being just insane at SS4, and having lots of extra utility in Evil Twin decks. To really round out this package, I'm on 1 ofs of Enemy Controller and Chalice. We really want to just push through negates.&nbsp;</p><p>2 Raigeki and 1 Lightning Storm are also main. Lightning Storm is a hedge against backrow decks, and Raigeki is just really good in a world of mirrors and Tears. Not being a HOPT makes the second Raigeki well worth running. I'm also on 2 Ultimate Slayer, which is pushed against Fusions and Links, and has a ton of utility in general. It can even send Toad for some value if you need to hit Xyz (Cat Shark might be a better send in those cases). I only want to run 2, because it is a HOPT and isn't as synergystic as Droplet, nor any good going first.</p><p>To round out the backrow hate I'm on 1 Cosmic Cyclone and 1 of the searchable Spright Smashers.</p><p>I like being on relatively smallish engines for both packages, so that you don't brick out on multiples too often but nearly always have play. The Frog engine is also as small as possible, I think in this version Dupe is a trap. It is okay, but not really nessessary - you grind fine and have actual ways to put up ATK points.</p><p>My extra deck hasn't changed much, but I'm on Cat Shark now to really push Gigantic over the edge. Djinn Buster comes up when you make Trouble Sunny, and also gives the deck an extra way to stop Nibiru and other hand traps when going first, but if you wanted to run something else that would be the cut. I'm on Omega for Slayer over Wind Pegasus, because I've found sending Omega to be really good in Dogmatika, and it is reasonable here, though the Wind Peg is missed.\</p><p>Still tuning. Made room for Ash.</p>"

If you don't mind going over 40, 3 is a good number.<br />+1 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring: In my matches 2 seemed fine. If you don't mind going over 40, 3 is a good number.<br /><br />+? Shiranui Solitair: Always been good with Uni Zombie, but I dropped him and honestly don't miss him all that much. Still a very good card to consider.<br />+? Zombie Reborn: It's an interesting card, though I honestly wouldn't know what to cut for it at this point. Vampires already need a lot, so it'd be easier to tech in a Zombie World deck instead. Not worth going over 40 for them in my opinion. Perhaps Vampire Awakening could be dropped for this one.</p><p>Extra Deck:<br />- 1 Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon: He's mainly here for nostalgia, a good option if you just need a beat stick to win though. Immortal Dragon could be a replacement for him, but it's not a big value increase imo.</p><p>Notes:<br />The 2 OCG cards (Volo, the Doom-Originator Vassal Dragon, and Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi) could be interesting for the Extra Deck once they come to TCG</p>"

So I went through my options of fun decks to play to get that achievement. First I thought True Draco since they&rsquo;re a really consistent deck that can Tribute Summon and lock your opponent out of the game very easily, but then I remembered I hate True Draco so I skipped it. Then I thought Monarch since it&rsquo;s a pretty cool deck and I really like the Monarchs as an archetype. But Monarchs are so damn expensive in Master Duel with all the URs and SRs you have to play in the deck. Next I figured I&rsquo;d pick up Floowandereeze since it was a new deck, but I hate Floo almost as much as True Draco so I skipped them as well. But that got me thinking of the other Tribute Summon bird archetype that I only knew of because of its broken Link monster. So, I jumped into making Simorghs since I&rsquo;d already had a ton of their cards from trying to gacha my way into getting Bird of Sovereignty for my Lyriluscs way back when, and I had a ton of fun playing the deck. Its endboards are very straightforward and powerful and it has a surprising amount of open space within the deck that can fit handtraps and something like a DPE engine. And hell, the lore for this deck is also so damn cool to me with the DARK and WIND counterparts battling it out before the two strongest of each Attribute fuse together into Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty to unite their Attributes together.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The more I played the deck there, the more I wanted to try building the deck for TCG play, and after hours of testing builds for the current TCG format, I landed on this deck. Now it is a bit far down the page given how much I wrote, so apologies in advance if you get annoyed trying to scroll back and forth to read my thoughts on the cards and then reading the actual card yourself.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Main Deck: </strong></p><p><em>Pringles:</em></p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh of Darkness (2x): The only in-archetype card that can negate a card, but it somehow has such an easy way to get it on the field. As long as you Tribute Summon a bird (or hell any DARK or WIND monster) and this card is in your hand or GY, this bird swoops in and summons itself. The negation does come with a cost of Tributing 1 WIND Winged Beast, but there&rsquo;ll be plenty of those flying around the board, and it can even Tribute itself if you need to dodge Spell/Trap effects. Just be aware that it only negates a Spell/Trap, so it&rsquo;s not super useful against monster heavy decks (which is so many decks rn). I run two since it&rsquo;s so accessible in the deck and only really needs to hit the GY to be of any use, but you can run three instead.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry (1x): This card is so damn good in this deck. While it doesn&rsquo;t provide ways to interact with your opponent on their turn, it does work like a Monarch in that it bounces up to two cards (they do still target for some damn reason tho) on Tribute Summon as long as the Tributes are only WIND monsters. Now this deck does include three DARK monsters, but luckily Bird of Ancestry counts them as WIND when their effects to be both WIND and DARK are active. So, you can Tribute using a Simorgh of Darkness and then grab it from your GY immediately afterwards. Just don&rsquo;t play more than one since it does have a tendency to brick your hand.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm (2x): The other main interaction in the deck. This big bird lets you spin a card (also targeting) whenever a Spell or Trap is activated, just also with a Tribute cost attached like its DARK counterpart (Simorgh of Darkness). It just doesn&rsquo;t have a Special Summon method like Simorgh of Darkness, and it requires itself to be Tribute Summoned for it to gain this effect anyway, so it is a bit more bricky. Two copies are still perfect for the deck though.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Dark Simorgh (1x): The iconic floodgate bird. Keeps your opponent from Setting any cards, and when paired with Anti-Spell Fragrance it becomes a complete lock on the opponent&rsquo;s backrow. Before siding, however, Dark Simorgh isn&rsquo;t gonna be as oppressive without Anti-Spell alongside it, but it does offer a 2700 body (or 3000 with Elborz up) with a way to lock any Trap-based deck (looking at you Altergeist) after it&rsquo;s summoned.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Bird of Perfection (3x): I&rsquo;ve played the deck both in Master Duel where this card has not been added yet, and this card makes a world of difference in how the deck plays. Without this card, you relied entirely on Simorgh, Bird of Bringing carrying the entire deck on its back. With this card, you can send a Simorgh of Darkness from deck to GY and grab a &ldquo;Simorgh&rdquo; Spell/Trap straight from deck either on its own Normal Summon or right after you Normal Summon another little bird and use their effects. You have to run three copies no matter what, just be aware that the best card in the deck isn&rsquo;t in Master Duel just yet so the deck is a lot more bricky there.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity (2x): While this bird&rsquo;s main utility is dumping Simorgh of Darkness to the GY, it can also dump Simorgh Onslaught and Simorgh Repulsion to modulate the levels of your big birds to make them easier to summon. It also starts the little birds&rsquo; trend of being able to Special Summon themselves from the GY if the open has an open backrow but with the restrictions that your Extra Deck is locked to Winged Beasts for the rest of the turn as well as banishing itself when it leaves the field. You don&rsquo;t really need to run three with Simorgh, Bird of Perfection in the game but running two is still solid. Definitely run three in Master Duel though given how this card&rsquo;s DARK (and better) counterpart is missing from the game.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring (3x): You really should run this in any deck that has the room. Stopping searching, dumping, and summoning from deck is just so strong.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Bird of Bringing (3x): This poor bird&rsquo;s back must hurt from carrying the hell out of this deck. It&rsquo;s like Aleister but it searches the entire deck, and the cards it can search include every single monster in the archetype, a search card that can set up the GY and grab two monsters from deck, a Giant Trunade that only hits the opponent that can also set up the GY, and the field spell that gives extra ATK and DEF alongside lowering the Tribute cost for a Tribute-focused deck aaaand an extra Normal Summon for a deck that gets effects on Normal Summon. It also includes the handy little bird effect that lets this deck pay the hefty costs of Simorgh of Darkness and Lord of the Storm. You have to run three of them no matter what.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Kurikara Divincarnate (3x): This is a bit of a more recent inclusion in the deck, but by God is this card insane. This deck struggles to play through big monster negate boards, so having a card that can break those boards and become a massive beater is exactly what this deck needs when going second. Not-so great for going first though.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Bird of Beginning (3x): Gives an extra Normal Summon in a deck all about Normal Summoning. It is a bit not great that it doesn&rsquo;t do anything else, but it gives easy access to Link 2s for the deck as well as extra Tribute fodder on field. Can also make use of the little bird effect to summon itself from grave.</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Spells: </em></p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal"">Harpie&rsquo;s Feather Duster (1x): Clears backrow in a deck that loves open backrow on the opponent&rsquo;s field. You&rsquo;ve gotta run the one copy you can.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh Onslaught (3x): While the discard cost can cause this card to brick, it searches two birds with different attributes for you. Now, before Bird of Perfection was released, you were really only grabbing Dark Simorgh or Simorgh of Darkness alongside the WIND target of your choice. But now, you get to grab the best card in your deck as well as a card that works right alongside it. It&rsquo;s just an insane search card. And it can even help with summoning your big birds more easily with its GY effect that lets you lower their Level by 1.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh Repulsion (1x): Another card with a discard cost, but it bounces the opponent&rsquo;s entire backrow to hand while being searchable by two monsters in the deck. It even has the same GY effect as Onslaught, giving it more utility. Just don&rsquo;t play more than one or two given how bricky it can be</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Pot of Prosperity (3x): Between Prosperity and Extravagance, Prosperity helps you way more with unbricking your hand. It basically says &ldquo;banish some of the Extra Deck you don&rsquo;t even use to dig through your deck for exactly what you need right now&rdquo;. Extrav&rsquo;s extra card is very useful, but I value Prosperity way more in the deck</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">The Monarchs Stormforth (3x): Given how little this deck uses the Extra Deck, the restriction given by Stormforth really doesn&rsquo;t matter all that much. And given you&rsquo;re almost always Tribute Summoning using one Tribute, it&rsquo;s basically just spot removal for your opponent&rsquo;s monsters</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh (3x): I know I said earlier that Bird of Bringing was carrying this entire archetype on its back, but this Field Spell is pretty much essential for starting your plays. If you can&rsquo;t find this card, you&rsquo;re not snagging an extra Normal Summon for free, you&rsquo;re not lowering the Tribute cost very easily, and you&rsquo;re losing your big birds to a Blue-Eyes. Bird of Perfection makes finding this card ludicrously easier now, but if you&rsquo;re playing on Master Duel you might want a Terraforming as well just to find this card more consistently.</li></ul><p><em>Traps: </em></p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal"">Infinite Impermanence (3x): This really could be any other handtrap, but I really like Imperm in basically every deck. It&rsquo;s even more useful in this deck given how it has no real way to negate a monster&rsquo;s effect</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Extra Deck: </strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This deck rarely ever goes into the Extra Deck (even if Sovereignty was legal) so all these cards can be swapped for anything really. Whether that&rsquo;s a pile of 15 random unsummonable cards or 15 cards that all synergize with the deck better than any of the cards I included, the Extra Deck is usually locked up pretty tightly with all the little birds locking you into Winged Beasts when they Special Summon themselves.</p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal"">Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand: Quick effect monster negation at the cost of two of the big birds. It can also be used to protect a card that&rsquo;s about to be popped or bounced or really anything.&nbsp;</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Aegaion the Sea Castrum: Allows you to banish a card from the opponent&rsquo;s Extra Deck and gains some ATK too. Just a bit less good than Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker since it&rsquo;s randomly chosen. Still a solid card and can provide monster destruction as well.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Tornado Dragon: Quick effect Spell/Trap destruction for a deck that looooves empty backrows. Since we&rsquo;re only playing three Level 4s in the deck (and they&rsquo;re all the same card), it&rsquo;s a bit tough to summon, but it&rsquo;s still a very useful option for the deck. Castel, the Skyblaster Mustketeer: Castel is probably the best card you can summon while locked into Winged Beasts. It gives a Book of Moon effect and can spin a card instead if you need that. Same camp as Tornado Dragon though, where it&rsquo;s rough to summon in the deck</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Totem Bird: This is one of the three Rank 3 Winged Beast cards in the game. The others being Number 49: Fortune Tune and Raidraptor Fiend Eagle. This also happens to be the best of the three with the utility it can provide a gummy boardstate. If your board needs a Spell/Trap negate and Simorgh of Darkness is a bit out of reach, Totem Bird can fill that role very well. Just be warned that we are only playing two Level 3s in the deck, so this situation is very very rare. But it&rsquo;s still a solid card to include regardless.&nbsp;</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Kikinagashi Falco: Other than the Lyriluscs, this is the only Rank 1 Winged Beast monster. It&rsquo;s a bit of a &ldquo;just to keep me alive for one more turn&rdquo; type card and works well at that job given that two Simorgh, Bird of Beginning in hand can make any Rank 1 with ease while also being very vulnerable to have out on the field alone. You can use the Lyriluscs instead or alongside this card though if you value their utility. Or hell, you could use any other Rank 1s too, but be careful about the Winged Beast lock if you do.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess: Just more monster negation in a deck that has no monster negation. I have yet to summon this card though given how the deck is almost always locked into Winged Beasts past three monsters on board, so you can definitely swap this card for a more reasonable option. There are just barely any good generic Winged Beast extra deck monsters to fill that gap.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos: Unlike Apo, this card can come up and is helpful with dealing with high attack monsters (since 3200 is basically the cap of this deck), but it does need to run over something else first to be able to contest a monster like that. It does get its protection effect very easily in this deck though which is why it&rsquo;s worth including.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle: After the ban of Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty, this became the best monster you could slot into its spot. It helps clear out the GY of problematic cards and can even become a 4800 if the stars align for you. It rarely ever comes up though.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Knightmare Phoenix: Now I hear you asking &ldquo;JMan, why are you only playing Phoenix and no Unicorn too?&rdquo; And the answer to that is very simple. If you hit three summons in this deck and can make a Unicorn, you will already have access to two other forms of bouncing/spinning. With how variable the Extra Deck for this deck is, you can absolutely swap something for a Knightmare Unicorn if you&rsquo;d like. Onto Phoenix though, it&rsquo;s just another way to pop Spells and Traps but much easier to summon than Tornado Dragon. Just a bit miffed that it&rsquo;s a Fiend instead of a Winged Beast, but we can&rsquo;t win &lsquo;em all.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy: Out of the two Charmers I included in the deck this one is a bit tougher to summon given how the deck plays less DARKs than WINDs, but Simorgh, Bird of Perfection is such an amazing card for the deck so you usually have the material if you desperately need it. Gives some searchability when it&rsquo;s destroyed as it gets you another Bird of Perfection and even Dark Simorgh.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant: The more generically useful Charmer for the deck as every single pair of Simorghs the deck can produce can make Wynn. Unlike Dharc that only has two search targets, this card has . . . two search targets. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not really as impressive as I thought when I first built the deck. It does also search Bird of Divinity and Bird of Protection if you run those cards in the deck but running Bird of Protection is not the best choice</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Pentestag: This is your win condition against Number 59: Crooked Cook during game one. Simorgh, Bird of Divinity is a much easier win condition during games two and three, but you can avoid the game three altogether with Pentestag.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Knightmare Cerberus: Pops a monster in a deck that has no way to natively pop a monster. Bouncing and spinning is usually better removal though, which this deck can do easily, but having a generic way to pop a monster is still useful since both those options involve Tribute Summoning.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Salamangreat Almiraj: Linking off a Normal Summoned Simorgh, Bird of Beginning into this card and then Special Summoning the Bird of Beginning with its own effect can let you Tribute Summon any of the big birds without even needing Elborz on field. This comes up very rarely, but it is useful in that situation. It&rsquo;s also useful for the same situation but with Simorgh, Bird of Bringing instead. You Normal Summon Bird of Bringing, and then either activate Elborz or search it out to be able to Normal Summon either Dark Simorgh or Simorgh of Darkness without needing a big WIND bird in hand to lower the Tribute cost.</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Side Deck: </strong></p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal"">Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju (3x): While this is the worst Kaiju in a pure Kaiju deck, it&rsquo;s the best Kaiju to include in any other deck at the moment given how Floowandereeze (the not based bird deck) can toss a Stormwinds on the field to lock you out of every single Kaiju other than Gadarla</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Bird of Divinity (1x): This card is a bit strange. It doesn&rsquo;t really help out the playstyle of the deck all that much, but it does act as this deck&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;Cowboy for game&rdquo; and can give you a win condition against some decks that you&rsquo;d be powerless against (like the Crooked Cook deck mentioned earlier</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird (3x): A very powerful handtrap that can end the game against some decks. It also ends the game against you however, so just be aware that if your opponent has the same mindset as you on including Droll in the side board, you will lose that game</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Change of Heart (1x): Now, most decks want to abuse this card as an extra Mind Control to help with extending Extra Deck plays. I, however, love using it as it was used waaay back when it was released. Either helping close out games by attacking with your opponent&rsquo;s monster as well or by Tribute Summoning using your opponent&rsquo;s card with no real restrictions</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Cosmic Cyclone (3x): Mystic Mine insurance. And additional backrow removal</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Anti-Spell Fragrance (3x): Can combo with Dark Simorgh to completely lock the opponent from accessing their Spells and Traps. I just don&rsquo;t include it in the main deck since going second with Anti-Spell is a bit of a bad time</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Red Reboot (3x): Insurance against Trap decks (i.e. my least favorite deck in the game, Altergeist). I just wish it was at two or three instead.</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Other Options: </strong></p><ul><li class=""MsoNormal"">Called by the Grave: Handtraps are brutal for this deck as you almost always need a searcher to resolve to make your plays. It&rsquo;s a one of though, so nine times out of ten you&rsquo;re gonna get handtrapped without this card, so it&rsquo;s really up to you whether it warrants the inclusion. If Called by the Grave gets put to two or three though, definitely run it in the deck</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh, Bird of Protection: Easily the worst card in the archetype as all it does is bounce a backrow on Normal Summon. However, this can help with bouncing a devastating floodgate before committing to more plays which is useful. It&rsquo;s just not very likely that you&rsquo;d value wasting your Normal Summon on Bird of Protection to achieve that instead of using a backrow removal card. It also looks really funky to me with those dog legs, but that might just be me.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Simorgh Sky Battle: With Bird of Sovereignty banned, this card is the best for providing targeting protection to your birds. It also has another effect that can bounce everything to the hand by sending itself and two big birds with different Attributes to the GY and then burning for 500 to each player for each card bounced. I just can&rsquo;t see the effect going off, but it is definitely a viable option for the deck.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Scatter Fusion: While Brilliant Fusion is (rightfully) banned, we can still use the newly released Scatter Fusion to fill that gap in our deck since we don&rsquo;t really use the Extra Deck. However, I did try using Scatter Fusion to summon Gem-Knight Seraphinite for an extra Normal Summon, but it doesn&rsquo;t stack with the additional Normal from Bird of Beginning and the deck already has its own built-in ways to bring out the big birds more easily with Elborz and the GY effects of the other Spells lowering the Tribute cost. It&rsquo;s still a fun idea to toy around with though.</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">The Monarchs Erupt: Look, it&rsquo;s another card that makes use of the deck&rsquo;s lack of need for an Extra Deck. This one also has some downsides too. While the Skill Drain effect on non-Tribute Summoned monsters is really really useful, it does shut down the effect of Dark Simorgh and every single little bird. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it doesn&rsquo;t impact Simorgh of Darkness as long as it Tributes itself for cost though, but I could be wrong. It could be fun to make a build of the deck around this card though, but it seems a bit wonky</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Kujakujaku: When I first started building the deck I was looking for a way to offset the Tribute cost of the big birds, I found this card. It gives you a Level 4 or lower WIND monster from deck or GY when Tributed, which is pretty great honestly. It just requires your Normal Summon or some extra help to be useful which kinda sucks</li><li class=""MsoNormal"">Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen: While I personally like playing decks more pure, Shuraig is by far the best Winged Beast monster you can put in the Extra Deck for this deck. It&rsquo;s just tough to make in the first place, but that goes for most of the Extra Deck anyways.</li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal"">All-in-all this deck performs surprisingly well against some competent strategies. As long as Droll doesn&rsquo;t resolve against you, this deck can put out some impressive turn one boards and even break boards reasonably well on the play. Just don&rsquo;t summon Bird of Ancestry against a Floowandereeze player or you&rsquo;re going to get completely clapped. If you have any question about the deck or even some suggestions, please let me know. Otherwise I hope at least some of you try the deck for yourself and see just how interesting such a simple-seeming deck can be.</p>"

The milling from Charge &amp; Raiden means that you only have to activate 1 Runick Quick-Play spell to draw 3 cards. Even better with Tip as it's like Engage on steroids (search 1 and draw 3). If you mill a copy of Fountain you can use Geri to recycle it and go straight into Chaos Ruler without paying any cost on the way. Chaos ruler with The Fabled engine can often lead to getting both tuners out in one go, allowing you to go into Baronne and Chengying via Chaos Ruler's revive before you've even started using your draw engine. You can easily end on 4 interruptions even through hand traps, and if not, it's possible to end on 8 interruptions. What makes this even better is that as you synchro summon, you fix one of the biggest issues with the deck by clearing the EMZ for more Runick monsters to be summoned. Soon, you'll forget a time when hard once-per-turns were a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Instant fusion is a fantastic tech here and allows you to play through hand traps as you can summon a Runick monster without clogging the EMZ. Even better interaction with Freki when it comes out. Card Destruction is optional however it can be useful in this Runick build because of The Fabled cards. Can be used to close out some games too. But you may want to change this tech for the current meta (looking at you, Tearalements).</p><p>Don't run more than 1 Golden Droplet. It's like giving your opponent a Desires that is also a delinquent duo for the cost of banishing 4 face-up. Idk why they printed it as a super...</p><p>I didn't create this strategy but I did refine the ratios to what I believe to be ideal. Thank you loads to the Runick discord community for helping me make this deck. They're making an in-depth Runick guide for every strategy when the deck gets released in the TCG.&nbsp;</p>"

With Yu-Gi-Oh's Elitist mentality once again on the rise for no apparent reason whatsoever, I decided to ignore all that and have a little fun here today. Because of this, I have given the newly released fusion archetype ""Tearlaments"" a test go on another particularly iconic fusion based archetype deck that has once again raised eye brows within the competitive scene over the past summer. HEROs have yet to have their main monster -Destiny HER-Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer , or -Fusion Destiny on the banlist; but alas with the immediate banning of -Predaplant Verte Anaconda , our overlords at Konami gave mercy to this anime archetype for right now. However, I didn't expiriment with the two for Phoenix Enforcer; but rather because I wanna know the true potential of Tearlaments as a whole (rather as a main or backup piece to any fusion deck).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;HEROs themselves are already self explanatory, and nothing has change involving the Extra deck layout or the usage of -Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier and -Elemental HERO Shadow Mist. What I did do this time is not including the likes of the Vision HERO package (due to the locking of only HERO base effects from -Vision HERO Faris ), and -Destiny HERO - Celestial (because of the favorability of -Destiny HERO - Denier due to being able to recycle any other Destiny HERO monster that is banished or in the GY, such as -Destiny HERO - Malicious). Masked HEROs included in the Extra deck have also been reduced, but not by a large portion because of the Tearlaments; rather the only subtraction is -Masked HERO Blast (in part because of not playing -Elemental HERO Stratos in this deck due to consistency issues during testing). -Masked HERO Dark Law remains to be the decks most important deck piece, not only because of its ease of access (thanks in no part to an easy access to -Elemental HERO Escuridao via Tearlament fusion, or any of the Destiny HERO monsters); but also due in large part to being able to mill any card from your opponents hand after their search (that could also have an important piece involved).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The new archetype, ""Tearlaments"" is niche for what it truly is. Being able to do it's thing in exchange of milling cards to the GY, then if they get milled to the GY (except for -Tearlaments Reinoheart ) can fusion summon by returning fusion materials back to the deck. As a result, it can open for many possibilities for fusion based decks who can Utilize generic dark monsters pretty well on their own. That being said, cards like -Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart and -Primeval Planet Perlerino can also benefit from the said effects that allows card removal upon activation of the latter effects. Not to mention that the small Shaddoll package included in this deck also has significance for Tearlaments (especially for easy access to -Tearlaments Kitkallos).</p>"

The&nbsp;<a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-name=""Awakening of the Sacred Beasts"">Awakening of the Sacred Beasts</a> can recycle any Dark Contracts or continuous spells or traps from your GY as long as you have any level 10 monster on your field.<br /><br />The side deck has powerful fiends in case you wanted even more kick to your Extra Deck or to change up the strategy a bit.<br /><br />This Deck is NOT meant to be played in tournaments or anything truly competitive if the forbidden card in this deck is any indication, it is only intended for casual fun duels and that's all. Hope you have fun with this!</p>"

This build is back to the Sprights being a supplementary engine - while Spright full combo does still exist, you're trying to make Trouble Sunny reasonably often. The deck has multiple lines depending on how you want to play and what you want to end on, and whether you're going first or second. It think it is great you can maindeck 2 Ultimate Slayer for pure profit as well. This is a combo/control deck that has tools to grind in the long game, but is capable of putting up ""huge"" boards in the short game, though you may be lacking in ATK points.</p><p>I opted for board breakers instead of imperm - our goal is to push through a field of negation and set up interruptions on the opponent's interruptions in the process. This list is as likely to summon Red to protect a Trouble push as it is to put up the Double Toad. I opted for a small as possible Frog engine, and as few bricks outside of Twins as possible, so that the deck can really push through for game without bricking out on bad cards (I should also point out, in this deck Twins enables OTKs and can help break boards, unlike most Slayer builds,)</p><p>Side deck is cards to out Mystic Mine and generic backrow, cards to break boards even better, and the Artifact Sanctum package so we can Scythe lock people going first.</p><p>I feel like Chalice is really good right now, and Enemy Controller is a pushed card going second in Twins,&nbsp;</p>"

Post POTE, this list is taking full advantage of P.U.N.K. JAM Extreme Session's draw power and potential to extend combos. This is still a list in progress, and I'm open to new ideas if you have any. <br /><br />Our starters are Ze Amin, Sharakusai with another P.U.N.K. in hand, Foxy Tune, Ogre Dance, Emergency Teleport, or Wa Gon with an extender in hand. We want to find the field spell either on the draw, or through our combo, and we want to try and get two triggers on the card draw effect. Typically we start by summoning or special summoning Ze Amin to search Foxy Tune or Ogre Dance, depending on which (if any) we have used already. If we have another P.U.N.K. in hand, we can get away with searching Deer Note off of Ze Amin instead. The next goal is to get Sharakusai onto the field, and use their ability to fuse Ze Amin with either Sharakusai or a P.U.N.K. in hand. Off of the Foxy Tune, we can summon Deer Note, but if we have another P.U.N.K. in hand I prefer to summon Sharakusai, so that we can find Wa Gon from deck. Once Sharakusai has made Rising Carp, we can activate Rising Carp to summon Deer Note and Wa Gon or Madame Spider from deck, depending on who we have already used. Now we have either a level 3 and a level 5 on field, or two level 3's and a level 5 on field, as well as our field spell. <br /><br />Typically we will make Chaos Ruler here, keeping Sharakusai on field and using one of the other P.U.N.K.s. If we drew the Red Hared Hasty Horse, we can extend into JAM Dragon Drive first to search either our last P.U.N.K., Ghost Ogre, or Psychic Wheeleder to extend further. Once we have made Chaos Ruler, and hopefully found a hand trap or a level 8 P.U.N.K., we go into Halq and search Jet Synchron, or Shinobi Necro if we milled the Jet Synchron. Synch Jet Synchron and Chaos Ruler for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss and summon back Jet Synchron, and we have a setup for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity on the opponent's turn, after we summon Formula Synchron off of Halq. If we milled Jet Synchron off of Chaos Ruler, we can leave a board with a level 8, Shinobi Necro, and Halq that can also make King Calamity. In addition to this setup going first we can usually also end with at least one other monster on field, one trap, and at least one hand trap. The other monster depends on what we need, ranging from Lambda if we have the Gamma in hand to Sanaphond the Sky Prison if we want to lock the opponent out of graveyard summons. <br /><br />If we open Gamma with Emergency Teleport, Foxy Tune, or Ogre Dance it can be beneficial to use one of their effects before commiting to our normal summon so we can counter hand traps with our Gamma. Pot of Avarice can be bricky if we get get our combo shut down, but it typically is a free draw two, and can shuffle back Rising Carp and Deer note for future turns, as well as putting Jet Synchron back in deck so we can summon it with Halq. If we get stuck on a P.U.N.K. whose ability gets negated, we still have follow-up plays. With Gizmek Orochi in hand, we can either make Psychic End Punisher or Halq, summon Ghost ogre or Sharakusai. With Psychic End Punisher, we can activate the P.U.N.K.'s ability on field even if their effect is negated to pay life points and turn on Psycic End Punisher's protection. If we summon ghost ogre off of Halq, we can summon back Gizmek on the opponent's turn and use Formula Synchron to make Chengying. If we search Sharakusai we can make Amazing Dragon on the opponent's turn and bounce a few cards, instead. If the opponent negates our P.U.N.K.'s effect and we have Red Hared Hasty Horse in hand, we can make Chaos Ruler and extend our play if we find/have a Foxy Tune or extender in hand, or we can make JAM Dragon Drive for a search. The biggest benefit that Hasty Horse gives us is the ability to make JAM Dragon Drive alongside Chaos Ruler. This makes Coach King Giantrainer very easy to make, as well as representing several searches/draws. <br /><br />That's it for the deck, I hope my description was somewhat clear and helpful. Let me know if you have any thoughts or comments below!</p>"

The Orcust portion of the deck is not needed so I am playing less of it and keeping it in the side, but can be fun to try sometimes. With a few copies of Sangan, Girsu and other extenders going first isn't so bad with pure Mekk-Knights, although drawing too many normal summonable monsters or none is a problem some of the time.</p><p>Evenly Matched is not needed for this deck, it is just a staple I already own. And if you have it I would recommend playing Accesscode Talker instead of Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior.</p><p>Gamaciel the Sea Turtle Kaiju, Harpie's Feather Duster and Pankratops should be sided out when going first in game 2 or 3, for Sangan, and World Legacy ""World Shield"". World Legacy ""World Shield"" can to used to protect World Legacy Secret from targeting effects or destruction effects, for this play make sure to put both World Legacy Secret and World Legacy ""World Shield"" in the same collumn as Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star as this allows all collumns to have a Mekk-Knight in them.&nbsp;</p><p>Cosmic Cyclone, Evenly Matched and Harpie's Feather Duster are all tools for different types of backrow decks. For monster heavy end boards, Dark Ruler No More, Gamaciel the Sea Turtle Kaiju and Pankratops are good tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally you will be assuming that the opponent's deck is monster focused with spells as extenders. This is why the main deck is on 3 World Legacy's Secret and 1 World Legacy Whispers, World Legacy Key is used at a way to add World Legacy ""World Chalice"" back to hand to discard for Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star's effect. With this ratio you can search World Legacy's Memory, World Legacy Succession or World Legacy Whispers if you already drew a World Legacy's Secret. World Legacy Scars is ok in the main deck in game 1 and when going first as it helps to get a World Legacy card in GY for summoning Lib the World Key Blademaster or to try to topdeck another monster or settable spell/trap.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Que tal, si estás aqui, de seguro es porque te interesa jugar un deck exodia, xyz o el arquetipo ""Numeron"", o los 3 a la vez, como estuvo popularizado hace un tiempo
<p>Este mazo consiste de 3 estrategias</p>

<ol>
 	<li>Poner en campo los 8000 puntos de vida con los monstruos Numeron y sus efectos</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Dejar un monstruo jefe, que muchos decks no puedan pasarle por encima como lo es el &lt;a data-name=&quot;Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops&quot;&gt;Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops&lt;/a&gt; o el Divino Arsenal AA-ZEUS- Trueno del cielo"">Dejar un monstruo jefe, que muchos decks no puedan pasarle por encima como lo es el Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops, Apollousa Bow of the Goddess o el Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS-Sky Thunder</a></li>
 	<li>Usar los motores Spellbook, Bamboo Sword, y cartas de Draw Power como Memories of Hope, XYZ gift, Allure of Darkness y Saryuja Skull Dread para acceder al poderoso efecto de Exodia y ganar la partida</li>
</ol>
<p>Junto con esto, la baraja cuenta con multiples ayudas para todo esto, Raigeki y Hey Trunade para deshacernos de cosas que nos molesten en el campo enemigo, o como un bait, Kaijus y Lava Golem para deshacernos de monstruos indestructibles o que nos restringen demasiado, y cartas de búsqueda como el Pathfinder y terraforming para tener mas posibilidades de acceder a la carta que hace que todo funciones, Numeron Network</p>
Una estrategia simple, es el deshacerse de un monstruo molesto con un kaiju, buscar usar numeron network para poder habilitar los motores de robo para buscar exodia, y si no funciona o se niegan los efectos, siempre puedes avanzar a pegar con todos los monstruos invocados por Numeron Network, y si todavia eso no terminó de darte la partida, puedes invocar a Fortress Megaclops (si sabes que no tiene formas de devolver al deck a este monstruo link o acceso a un monstruo xyz que lo pueda sobrepasar) , Apollousa( si sabes que negando unas cuantas cartas, dejara sin forma de jugar al rival) o AA-ZEUS ( forzar una destrucción de una carta para acoplar un segundo material y utilizar su efecto,  si sabes que destruir todos sus recursos, acabará por dejar sin juego al oponente)

Due to the fact that the Tears and Danger!s are DARK monsters, you can freely use them while spamming out Orcust plays. As with all Orcust strategies, the main game plan is to Link into Galatea, and act from there.

The Tears can also be used for their fusion effects, fusing with a Danger! or Orcust to make Mudragon, or fusing with another Tear to make Kitkallos (who can be used to mill yourself more to go into more Orcust plays). After your first fusion summon, hitting another Tear can go into Dragostapelia which is a free negate.

Ratios that can be changed are: Wand, Crescendo, and Return."

I'm still not a Tear master &amp; Im open to any advice but this is the deck that I came up with to play.

I didn't max out on Sea Mare because I didn't want to brick with too many normal summons. Avramax a little uncommon in Tear builds but I:P into Avramax; you'd be surprised how hard it is for some decks to out that. I didn't max out on all the fusing Tears because I wanted to keep the deck at 40.

Deck is powerful; has access to Mirrorjade, Avramax, Chimera &amp; Tears. Doesn't usually brick.

Enjoy!"

","It is a regular Marincess deck with the popular 5 card Shark engine, consisting of simply 3x Abyss Shark and 2x Silent Angler. The Handtraps are very interchangable, altough Ash and Crow are very strong this format. I usually play 2 Battle Ocean in the main deck, this time the 2nd one is in the side deck in case your opponent is playing a lot od S/T removal like Cosmic Cyclone. If Battle Ocean gets banished and is your only copy, you are in trouble but Great Bubble Reef beatdown and a prayer might help.

Honestly you can take out Bahamut and Toad for Transcode and Accesscode if you feel like it!

I hope you enjoy my decklist and feel free to play with the ratios.

Have fun!"

First activate spell Black Whirlwind, then Normal Summon Blackwing - Simoon the Poison Wind without tributing from hand, but you need to banish Blackwing - Mistral the Silver Shield to do that, then activate Black Whirlwind on summon to add Black Wing Monster that can be Special Summoned from hand (I recommend Blackwing - Oroshi the Squall). If you added Blackwing - Oroshi the Squall, Special Summon him, and Synchro using Simoon and Oroshi to Blackwing Tamer - Obsidian Hawk Joe. Then activate Obsidian Hawk Joe's effect to Special Summon Blackwing - Simoon the Poison Wind from GY into Defense Position. That's small combo which I minded of. If you want, you can find more combos for yourselves. Until next time, Goodbye!

Spiced up by the small Isolde engine with Renaud and Fire Flint Lady, the equip spells are necessary for Isolde's effect but kinda usefull on it's own (D.D.R. is a free Leviair basically). No RotA it's a necessary decrement, but it's not as a big of a deal as having 46 cards that feel a lot heavier, if I'm not satisfied by the Isolde engine I'll switch back to RotA.

DPE it's always usefull, with the banning of Anaconda and Fusion Destiny Semi-limited isn't a free turn 1 play, and there could be games that you can OTK even before having to place the HERO (please note: also GET OTKed, this deck isn't as powerful as some formats ago and surely isn't as powerful as Adventurer Variant).

In hand you'd like one of those cards: ""Tour Guide of the Undeworld"", ""The Phantom Knights of the Torn Scales"" or a Danger!?, usefull extenders a Foolish Burials, Emergency Teleport and the chain locking Kagemucha Warrior are perfect for a faster OTK. In 10 starting hands that i played only one bricked (before I added Almiraj), so the deck is still pretty consistent, and looses hard to Nibiru or some form of interruption.

Finally, the deck is still lots of fun and I think still a worthy opponent as a T2/rogue deck in T1 formats, side deck varies based on the event I've put cards that I think will be usefull most of the times (if Anti-Fragrance gets banned I would put some form of interruption for Depia and Sky Striker, probably a Veiler to stop their strategy on a monster effect level). I hope to get some more advice on the build, as the last time."

Game 1 is about catching them off-guard trying to win with Destiny Board. Evil, I know. More evil is that we aim to win using Mystic Mine, everyone's favorite field spell. There's not much to it than that, other than winning the die roll so you can set up your board going first. Unless you're playing a deck that has non-monster effect outs to Mine, you're basically guaranteed to win the game. Just watch out for your set spells and traps that you can't automatically activate. Waboku and Threatening Roar don't have activation requirements, but Demise of the Land (needs your opponent to special summon) and Trap Trick (needs an empty spell and trap slot) do. Otherwise, you'll be left with spelling out f-i-n-a. Game 2 I side out the Destiny Board shenanigans and just play straight up Mystic Mine Heal &amp; Burn. The reason is obvious because now they've caught on to you and are prepared to take out DB and MM. The name of the game is to protect your Mystic Mine. Golden Ladybug and Ghost Sister will keep your life points above theirs so that you either win with time or Dark Snake. And of course, resolving Waking the Dragon is funny as hell. Although it really sucks when they destroy it and you have Jowgen on the field. :/ Overall, I think this is a cool deck to win with Destiny Board. It's certainly funny as hell and will annoy your opponents. I usually go about 2-2 in four rounds at locals. It's time to duel!</p>"

Machinex is good in a meta where tearlaments just float into more stuff under most removal.

The deck can make a big zeus going second.

Side deck is just what I feel like may help in certain matchups

This deck is also really cheap.

If you have more money play barrone over groza."

Special Summon Crimson Resonator, then after that Special Summon Wandering King Wildwind. Synchro both of them to Red Rising Dragon, then use Red Rising Dragon's effect to Special Summon Crimson Resonator back from the GY. After you Special Summoned Crismon Resonator, activate it's effect to Special Summon Synkron Resonator and Red Resonator from Deck. After you Special Summoned both of them, use Red Resonator's effect to gain LP equal to Red Rising Dragon's attack. After that Synchro with Red Resonator and Red Rising Dragon into Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon, then use it's effect to excavate Top 5 cards from your Deck. If you excavated Wandering King Wildwind, add him into hand (If you excavated Majestic Dragon, let him stay in GY). After you added him, Normal Summon Witch of the Black Forest then Synchro using Witch of the Black Forest with Crismon Resonator to Red Rising Dragon and use it's effect again to Special Summon Crismon Resonator back. Then go to Synchro again using Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon and Crimson Resonator to Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane. After you have done that, use Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon to banish Majestic Dragon and one DARK Monster from your GY or Hand to Special Summon him. Now you got 3 Synchro Monsters which are available to FTK, BUT... If your opponent has face-down monster attack with Red Rising Dragon, then with Bane and activate it's effect on dealing Battle Damage to your opponent to Special Summon Red Resonator from GY and Crimson Resonator from Deck.
