Yes, Romulus equals to infinite negates, making Channeler, Perfumer, and Rescue Rabbit a 1 card Mist Valley lock. H","Romulus turbo deck, it means any 2 dragons/winged beasts are enough to fuel the combo. So we play 3 Channeler, 3 Perfumer, and 3 Rescue Rabbit as our main starter because it makes our Feather Storm online to prevent Nibiru and other monster handtrap while still can summon Romulus. Use Romulus add Divine Lance, use Divine Lance, equip and ss Phalanx, make Linkross using Romulus ss 2 tokens, make Halqifibrax using Linkross + Phalanx and ss O-Lion, make Martial Metal Marcher, use Martial ss O-Lion/Phalanx (Phalanx better, so enemy's D.D. Crow wont give us -2 card advantage) chain O-Lion ss token, make Union Carrier using Mecha Phantom Beast token + Martial, make og Clausolas using O-Lion/Phalanx + Linkross token, make Simorgh link 3 using Clausolas + Halq.  This deck will be even better once the new Dragunity support come, because you can easily make Dragunity Areadbhair + Herald Arc Light + Black Garden (prevent opponent from atking Arc Light), all just from a single Romulus too (by switching to Auroradon instead of using Simorgh/Clausolas). We will still have follow up because Garden Rose Maiden can revive Areadbhair and you can even summon Dragunity Arma Gram/Dragunity Glow (searchable by Romulus) if you have it in hand. I dont use Harpie synchro as it is a combo deck, it means we wont be running that much option to trigger its effect as interruption.  <img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/4/42/MaiValentine-DULI.png/257px-MaiValentine-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Pros: Ultra consistent, minimal resource, have Nibiru (or other handtrap) prevention, follow up play is okay-ish, big space for staples.  Cons: Infinite negates is only once/twice per chain, it means your opponent can break the cycle by interrupting it mid-chain."

The main normal summon is the Kaleido Chick, and it can be searched or summoned from the deck in a variety of ways like the Tenki or the grave effects of the Perfume and the Serenade Dance.  Fusion spells are also easy to get to with the Black Sheep and Yellow Martin (Both of which are just as searchable as the Kaleido Chick).  The Dark Ruler No More and the Twin Twisters are just a couple cards that can help going second, but they can be replaced by other cards that you think may help you."

It also has the capability of looking into an opponent's deck with the chance of removing a card from the other players' hand giving it a Millenium Eye ""Mind Scan"" effect. I will be modifying it later, but as a warning, this is a 1 first turn deck meaning that this version has to go first.  Toon Gemini Elf can exist before Toon World or Kingdom is played. Like all toons monsters, it has the ability to attack your opponents directly.  You also want to try and banish any key cards a player has with the trap cards, Trickstar Reincarnation and Chain Dissappearance. Reincarnation will disrupt plays by banishing any monster, spell, or traps they could play in their hand. Chain Dissappearance will only banish all copies of the monster that has 1000 atk or lower. The Forceful Checkpoint allows to you send a monster from the hand to the grave after negating their attack.  Crackdown, Heartfelt Appeal and Comic Hand allows you to take your opponent's monsters and use them as you see fit given you are able to hit the right targets.  Then there's the usual protection of Solemn Counter trap cards. However it's at the cost of your own LP.  I do have other cards in mind to add it on for the future. Just got to make it more wackier than usual!"

Easily executed Link-based deck that COULD ruin your opponent's day, although not as much as banish and burn de","2 Cyberse monsters (Tokens included) 》 Splash Mage + 1 (Splash Mage effect) 》 Transcode Talker + 1 (Transcode Talker effect) 》 Accesscode Talker (or any Topologic monster, depending on the situation)  The primary goal is to bring out Accesscode Talker with 5300 ATK and at least 2 ""Spell Speed 4"" destruction effect activations (from the Link monsters used in the combo).  Various negates, especially Mystic Mine, were included in the deck because Accesscode Talker is defenseless during the opponent's turn. Mystic Mine will not become a hindrance even if your opponent only has one monster on the field since the deck relies on the alternation of Special Summons and Link Summons, which essentially only requires one monster on the field at any given time to continue the combo.  If Accesscode Talker was removed from the field during the previous turn, another one could be brought out again easily if you could summon 2 monsters on the field. This is very easy to do since all of the Effect Monsters in the Main Deck revolve around Special Summons and Tokens; the opponent would have to burn at least two negates in order to break your combo in most cases, even more if you have a good hand.  Mathmech Addition and Mathmech Subtraction are also great options, especially in baiting your opponent's once per turn negates (e.g. Cyber Dragon Infinity). However, I did not include them in this iteration because there were other options that could synergize well with Lady Debug and Cyberse Gadget, or at least that's what I thought."

Turn 1 deck with strong turn 2 options. Extending into Snowdrop early, to enable early big bodies for your board. Mardel fishes for things you need on hand. Boss Stage. Primula. [Multiple Primulas can summon at once, seeing the effect can only trigger once]. Hiding things in the GY for later plays. Rose Girl for constantly recurring itself with Petal when you need recovery. Pot of Avarice to help recycle Snowdrop and Mardel for later use. Loptr is a Turn 1 insurance card. He makes sure you have something defensive to play. Brings out Mardel, who then lets you hand pick a card from the deck whether its a plant or Generaider card. Buffs any tokens that were brought out by Boss Stage.  Trying to tweak this into something that can better and consistently deal with/handle Altergeist.  EDOPro sucks... Don't use it. EDOPro sometimes registers Primula's effect to special summon herself as Snowdrops effect to tribute a plant by then locking out Snowdrop from using her own effect. So, use Dueling Book or hand test yourself.  Definitely, not the best deck. FOR NOW! With the play-testing online and IRL I have been having fun with this deck and I will continue to evolve this deck, hopefully, into something more competitive. I find the spell card Rikka Flurries is way more powerful than it's current consideration and should be a card to keep your eye on."

So I thought I will try tweaking the list a bit to fit Ultramafus while still making it consistent. This list was meant to downgrade Guru control from tier 2.5 to tier 3 in hopes of getting fun and not being called a meta fag by summoning Ultramafus turn 3 and aprove dominance by making Ultramafus 3.5-5k atk and OTK your opponent turn 3 or 5 ...  This deck is a go first deck and your God hand and go first tactic is basically Guru control and then turn 3 try swinging for big damage or control even moar.  These are the important cards you want to always see are Hidden City, Fiendess, Guru, Called/Ash/Imperm, and Final Battle/Trap Trick. These are the cards you don't want to see when going first is Nemesis Archer.  If you go first but see no Guru or Hidden City but have Fiendess, Ultramafus or Umastryx, and Final Battle or Trap Trick do the following play: Norma Summon Fiendess, Fiendess eff, Ultramafus or Umastryx, set Final Battle. If you have Called and Imperm set it, it is better than doing nothing.  You could also replace Necrovalley for Mystic Mine but to me it is riskier to play Mystic Mine because you have a limited options than to play against an opponent who plays Gravekeeper's.  &nbsp;"

This deck has a few combos that add up to a big one. I will put the 3 main combos here: 1-Cards needed = 1 HERO monster and 1 Vision HERO Faris in hand.  Combo: Discard the HERO to SS Faris, Faris eff will put Increase into the ST. then Increase will send Faris to GY to SS itself from the ST and Vion from the deck, then Vion will send a HERO from deck to GY, then banish Farris w Vion eff to add Polymerization. 2-Cards needed = 2 HERO monsters on field and Malicious on GY. Combo. Link summon into Xtra HERO Cross Crusader, Cross eff will revive the Malicious, then Cross will tribute the Malicious to search a HERO, then Malicious eff will SS banish itself from GY and SS a Malicious from deck. Then u can either link summon into Wonder Driver or Dread Deimator, or fusion summon. 3-Cards needed = 2 HERO monsters w different atributes + poly. This is a simple 2 fusion summon combo. u fuse into Sunrise then use its eff to add Miracle fusion to your hand, then play miracle fusion.  To get a big combo just do combos 1, 2, and 3 together.

Millennium-Eyes Restrict then allows you to lock down your opponent and take the game.  Some points of interest... <ul>  	<li>Advanced Ritual Art uses Thousand-Eyes Idol as its target, which then sets it up in the GY for the summoning of Thousand-Eyes Restrict.</li>  	<li>King of the Swamp's search effect also sets up your GY nicely, since it can be used there as substitute for Relinquished.</li>  	<li>Radian is the ""safest"" Kaiju in that it interacts well with Allure of Darkness. Jizukiru and Thunder King, however, will power up your Relinquished/Restricts above the 3000 ATK threshold.</li>  	<li>Lava Golem, meanwhile, eats two monsters at the cost of your normal summon. This isn't always a safe choice, because both Manju and the Predaplant engine rely on your normal summon.</li>  	<li>Consider running a second Darlingtonia Cobra, because Garnets suck.</li>  	<li>Illusionist Faceless Magician gives longevity to an Eyes Restrict monster summoned by Instant Fusion (or the effect of Instant Fusion, copied by Anaconda).</li>  	<li>Perhaps it goes without stating, but the GY effect of Relinquished Fusion should be reserved for Millennium-Eyes Restrict whenever possible. It's the only monster of this archetype which has no native monster steal effect; only through Relinquished Fusion and Millennium-Eyes Illusionist can you use it proactively.</li>  	<li>The side deck contains only suggestions—I wouldn't recommend that exact side deck, but I would recommend any of those cards as options.</li> </ul>"

The best combo is a 2 card hand loop (1 random, 1 of their choice) with an extra deck lock: <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=452708-19019245</a>  this deck has the ability to draw a bunch of cards improving consistency: <a>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=452708-19077232</a>  despite this, it is NOT a competitive deck and will likely flop against most rogue decks."

It's your boy, TheDeathMachine here, coming to you with my new Cyber Dragon deck profile! I call it ""K/DA - Kill Die Arise!"" And here's why. It's <em>DEFENITELY</em> not because K-Pop stans are threatening to drive by my house! Eheheh...  &nbsp;  About a week ago, I found a music video on League of Legends's official YouTube channel, in which the K-Pop group K/DA sang their song, POP/STARS. In fact, they also preformed it live in the opening ceremony of the LoL World Championship in 2018. To quote LongBeachGriffy, ""THIS! SH*T! IS! FIAAAAAAH!"" I loved the song so much, it actually inspired me to make this deck. The reason why I chose Cyber Dragons in particular was because of the neon/techno themes in the music video. I'll be posting the links to both down below.  POP/STARS Music Video: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOxkGD8qRB4</a>  POP/STARS Live Performance: <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9oDlvOV3qs&amp;t=54s</a>  &nbsp;  Kill Die Arise! functions just like a normal Cyber Dragon deck would; your goal is to go second and lay the smackdown on your opponent. To help ensure this, KDA! has 3 copies of Power Bond and Lightning Storm in the Main Deck, while also running Side Deck options like the oh-so hated Dragun of Red-Eyes. That being said, please enjoy OTKing your opponent to the sound of K-Pop!"

The deck still includes UCT (Ultimate Conductor Tyranno) and Overtex Qoatlus for negations and bord breaking. The deck also uses the True Kings to extend combos and special summon more monsters. The main difference here is that the deck includes hydrogeddon, oxygeddon and duoterrion to ultimately summon ""Water Dragon"" and ""Water Dragon Cluster"". In the side deck i included some cards so that the deck has some more options for disrupting the opponent and stopping some of their key combos."

I play that Deck myself in real life (and I love it) since it came out, so I have some Experience with it. The Main Strategy is always the same, but the Tech-options can vary a lot. I always try new Techs/Strategys, but I found this list very good so far. At my local Store I made second Place with it ( It´s a while ago, so I had some other  Cards in my Side Deck, but the Side Deck Choice is always different depending on the format, so...). With this Deck you want to go first, to set up everything you need. Goal is to summon Zerrziel (Link 3 Monster) equipped with Selene and Summon Limit, or There can be only one. Those Traps shut down so many Decks and it makes it much more easier for you.  There can be only one also restrict yourself, but to be Honest you just need one Monster (Serziel or Zerrziel) and having only one Dark Monster on the Field forces the opponent to use his Monsters when attempting to use Super Polymerization. Those Traps also increase the pressure on the opponent, because they have to deal with two spell/traps that threatening them. To make sure your Selene or the Traps don´t get destroyed or banned set the Evil Eye Countertrap. Only use that for the mentioned spell/trap removal. Protecting your Selene is very important. When you go into the second game you could side in another Evil Eye Countertrap or something similar. One major Plus point of this Deck is, that nearly no one knows this Deck and underestimates it. Most times those opponents loose the Game^^ I play this Deck quite a while now and I have to say that the worst Thing that can happen to this Deck is getting Kaiju-ed. In every other case the opponent first has to deal with the Selene and then with the Monster so he/she has to put some (Card-) material to it, which reduces his/her Cards. When you get Kaiju-ed you loose everything without the possibility to react to it. So in my Opinion it is absolutely mandatory to have Mask of Restrict in the side Deck especially for game two. Getting out Zerrziel (Link 3) first turn is very easy with Tour Guide. You special summon Catoblepas, the summon Gorgon (Link 2), the special summon Catoblepas from the Grave and then go into Zerrziel. You then also have one Evil Eye Card in your Graveyard that you can banish for Evil Eye Repose (if you have it in Hand) without disadvantage. With Ghost Sister you have to be careful, because when you didn´t get any life points through this, you loose half your life points, which is a bad Thing in a Deck relying on Lifepoint-paying. It is a very good Handtrap in this Deck because sometimes you really need that Life Point-recovery. When I use it, then as follows: 1. Only when it is worth it. What I mean with this is: Some Decks can clear your Board and easily kill you in that same Turn. So if you see that is such a Deck or a Deck that special summons a lot (especially Monsters with high ATK) you should use it. Because sometimes an Opponent stops further summons to prevent giving you such a high amount of Life Points. 2. Only when he activates a Card or effect that would special summon a Monster, because the you are safe that you get Life points with it (except he can special summon a Monster with 0 ATK and ends it there. This is very rare but I had that case once, so just keep it in Mind^^). The cards in the Side Deck are only one possibility.  My Main Deck except a hand full of cards mostly stays the same, but the Side Deck is always Changing. That said you can exchange everything to your own Playstyle. The only card that I would highly recommend you to play in the Side Deck is Mask of Restrict. When you get Kaiju-ed and the opponent doesn´t have a Brick or has a slow Deck you will probably loose the game.  So, now I wrote a lot and I will end this now. I could say something to every card choice and the chosen number of them and talk about some plays that you can do with different Hands, but that would be too much for here. I should recommend doing a Video about it^^  I´m always open to new Ideas, so if you have some Tips or interesting Ideas please leave a comment. I would love to here some other opinions.

Two Sacred Beasts with their total of 8000 attack points are impeccable in terms of offense and defence. <em>Fallen Paradise</em> offers protection and card draw. Gathering all these cards on board can be achieved even in the first turn depending on your starting hand. I aimed to make it consistent as possible. Even partially completing this combo is pretty strong. If all fails, you can resort <strong><em>Armityle the Chaos Phantom </em></strong>to deal a huge blow to your opponent. ***EDITS BY ME*** **Remove** 2x Twin Twisters, 1x Raviel, 1xHamon, 1x Foolish Burial, 1x Jar of Avarice. **ADD** 2X Allure of Darkness, 1x Called(designator) from the grave, 1x Unending Nightmare, 2x Crackdown (manhunt)."

","Unicore going to 3 got me looking at Nekroz. The Deskbot 003 combo seemed really good on paper, but it doesn't play under Nibiru, which is really common in this meta, and it also incorporates a huge number of bricks for a combo card you can only run 3 copies of, since there's no rota for 003. Unicore next to Kristya is also a little redundant, and I feel it's not a great use of its power. It's definitely a good combo, which I might be inclined towards, but I feel like to truly take advantage of the Nekroz deck you should play it sort of like Invoked Shaddoll last format, and turbo out Nekroz of Unicore.  In the main deck we get 9 ROTAs, all of which find us either a Ritual spell or monster. 3x Manju of the Ten Thousand hands uses up our normal summon for this, but the deck is not normal summon reliant, since you are a ritual deck. Extra-Foolish Burial is either a Rota by sending Herald of the Arc Light or targeted removal by sending Elder Entity N'tss. Both of these cards are useful Kaleidoscope targets, so the cost for this is a measly 400o LP. Preparation of Rites recycles a Ritual spell while adding a ritual monster that's level 7 or lower, but because of Clausolas and Brionac you can grab either a Nekroz spell or Monster. Having 12 ways to find Unicore and 11 ways to search a ritual spells, plus the actual copies of each in your deck makes turboing out Unicore very plausible.  We're only running 1 Shurit. He makes higher level Nekroz monsters more plausible and is still an important 1 of, but the deck has literally a dozen ways to search him thanks to all the ROTAs.  For Nekroz Ritual Monsters, 3 Unicore is obligatory. The secondary effect is very useful, and unlike some of his peers he can be full material for himself, so multiple copies are fine and you want to see this card. The whole point of the deck is turboing this onto the field and seeing if your opponent can play through him. It's notable that Eldlich outs him very easily, with 6 copies of Golden Lord, even with other Nekroz cards backing Unicore up. This played into my card choices.  I'm also running 3 Brionac. This is an essential combo piece with Preparation of Rites, also it finds Clausolas which finds rituals spells, and its 3 MORE copies of Unicore. The goal is as much consistency as possible, so 3 seemed ideal. It also really helps going second to break boards, which makes this deck good going second as well as first. Yay!  2 Nekroz of Clausolas helps make Preparation of Rites search either spells or monsters, contributing to that whole ""12 Rota"" feel. Effect negation on the board is occasionally good, like against Zombies, still kind of a deck, or uhh... Maybe Toons? Not a lot of maindeck archetypes right now besides Eldlich, which also activates effects out of the hand and GY anyways.  2 Nekroz of Trish are basically hand traps that are searchable by all of our 12 Rotas, which do the Sauravis thing. Having played Vanity stun, the power of that is immediately obvious. Also, while the deck can find it hard to summon sometimes thanks to Extravagence, it has a great effect going second to 3 for 2 your opponent. This card is the real reason you need Shurit.  2 Nekroz of Valkyrus round off the hand traps. This one is the easiest of all of the high-level Nekroz monsters to summon, and can gain you card advantage going first, especially in combination with Manju. Its real purpose is to protect Unicore from destruction by battle, very relevant against Eldlich, or against any deck with high attack monsters you can summon in the main deck.  2 Cycle, 2 Kaleidoscope, and 1 Mirror round off the Ritual spells. All of these are good, but with 11 searchers for them and 5 copies you should be good on seeing these in your hand.  I'm running 3 Pot of Extravagance, which can hurt with Kaliedoscope sometimes, but generally is worth if for sheer card advantage. Its also good Ash bait in a deck that needs searchers, and may be better than Called by the Grave for getting your plays going against Ash, which is still seeing some play as a 2 of.  That left room for 10 hand traps, and I wanted to take full advantage of it. To me, being able to run 10 interactive cards was the main perk of playing this version of the deck. I focused on cards that would help against Eldlich in the main deck, since the Eldlich matchup is seriously rough, but in the side deck I have options for, Adamancipator, as well as various ways to board against combo and control, including spicier versions of Eldlich and Altergeist, which are both actually pretty good right now (I know Geist is a rogue deck, but it was still topping with 1 Multifaker and now it has 3), plus going second cards.  The only things in the extra deck besides Kaleidoscope targets, including some which double for Extra-Foolish Burial, is Eria Gentle into Accesscode. This lets us imitage Shaddolls even further, by increasing the decks potential to OTK (when it doesn't see Extravagence).  ***EDIT***  Added original flavour ROTA over an interaction slot. Through Clausolas it is the 12th spell rota, and the 13th Shurit Rota. Basically a better flex slot when I decided to add Shurit #2.  ***EDIT***  Added I Shaddoll Dragon main and 3 Shaddoll Apkallone to the extra deck. This lets us make Brionac to break boards more easily, while also popping an additional spell/trap. It's worth losing 1 Cyclone for this mini engine, since Dragon is also useful for popping spells/traps with Nekroz Rituals, and 1 copy can be recycled to pop more cards with Apkallone."
