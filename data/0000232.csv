&nbsp;

IN CASE ALISTEIR EFF OR GAGAGA SISTER IS NEGATED BY OPPONENT HAND TRAP OR OTHER...ETC..

So in case gagaga sister or alisteir got negated and in your hand u have ranryu/Jigabyte, Summon predaplant verde and use eff to summon dark dragoon.

If you have Zexal / Reinforcement / Ascend sage in hand instead of ranryu/jigabyte, u can summon if u want dragonar + utopia leo ray and in your opponent turn summon number 38 also.

&nbsp;

The purpose of Kaiju monster, Frobidden droplet and Dark ruler no more is to get rid of some troublesome monsters usually with negate effects.

if u want to make the deck more budget, remove the forbidden droplet and replace it with dark ruler no more and Kaiju monster.

&nbsp;

Some important tips:

If u use onomatopaira to discard card,  never discard Gagaga sister, Bancho or utopic onomat....

In the side deck is Tackle crusader, this monster can be send in the grave by Beatrice during your opponent turn and set 1 monster to face down, it's like book of moon, maybe u will need it in some duels.

With pot of prospe.... u can banish from extra deck 3 cards, usually if i am sure i will have light monster in grave i am banishing artemis,  utopia lighting, number 41, or utopia lightning , number 41 and 1 mechaba, deppends what i have in hand. if u need to dig very deep for kaiju/droplet or dark ruler , banish 6: utopia lightning, number 41, predaplant verde, dark dragoon, artemis and 1 mechaba, deppends what u have in hand and what your opponent have on field,  zeus also is target for banishing in case of emergency

&nbsp;

Spell wall and Inari fire in the side deck is used if u play against someone full of hand traps or some other troublesome cards.

I hope i didn't forget to mention something, i am lazy to write more.

&nbsp;

Good luck.

Then, use Red Rising's effect to special summon the lvl 2 tuner you used. If it's red resonator you can gain 2100 lp and go into Scarlet Red Dragon and if it's crimson resonator you can bring out two resonators from your deck (like red resonator and synkron resonator) which you can use to go into other boss monsters like Hot Red Dragon, Tyrant Red Dragon, King Calamity or even Red Supernova. Allure, Resonator Call, Resonator Command, Witch of the Black Forest and Synkron Resonator all help get cards needed to start combos and extend combos. The Synchro boss monsters (lvl 9+) also protect themselves and other monsters with their negates or swarm the field with resonators or lower level Synchro monster so you can go into bigger Synchro monsters. This deck is a first turn deck but can also work on second turn if you opponent doesn't have facedowns."

 	<li>Activate Swirl Slime from the hand, and fusion summon Dragonbane King Beowulf using itself and your Lvl7 D/D/D</li>

 	<li>Normal Summon Nighthowl and use its effect to summon the Lvl7 D/D/D From your graveyard</li>
 	<li>Synchro Summon High Gust King Alexander</li>
</ol>
Now, you should have Dragonbane King Beowulf, a random D/D/D monster, and High Gust King Alexander with 6000 Atk on the field.

If your opponent has counter cards, then you can always wait for the card you need to be drawn again.

You can also perform a similar combo using D/D Berfomet, using its effect to change Nighthowl to Lvl6.

Also, it doesn't have to be Gust High King Alexander for this combo, it could be a different synchro.

Feel free to experiment with different cards to make the most effective combo."

How we get there is pretty typical for cyberdark decks: use Cannon and Claw to search creatures and spells, respectively, with the goal of filling up the graveyard and hand with at least 5 cyberdark monsters. Use chimera to search for Power Bond, and fuse your boss monster. We have two Power Bonds, in case we open with one, and we're running one Attachment Cybern and three Cyberdark Invasion to allow Cyberdarkness dragon to have more negates.

If our boss monsters are destroyed, we can recurse them with Cyber Eternal, which we can search with Cyber Dragon Core. Our main source of removal is attacking, but we can also use Jizukiru to tribute an opponents monster, then fuse him with our Cyber Dragon Core to make Chimeratech Fortress Dragon.

In the extra deck, Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf is there in case we can't make it to full combo.

One of the deck's big weak spots is its inability to draw. If we make our boss monsters and they are removed, we need cards in hand to make followup plays, so try to conserve your hand as best as possible."

You can still manage backrow decks with the likes of Denko but your G1 is severely hindered by them so if you wanted to play it in a backrow heavy environment, Denko should be considered in the main over something like Chalice or Droplet. List is definitely cuttable to a straight 40 if you wanted to go this route as you could replace one of the monster negates in the main with Harpie's Feather Duster instead for example. If you wish to play the list in the current format, just cut White Exalted of Dogmatika and Dogmatikabre and the deck will function almost the same but with slightly less power. Nadir Servant being able to send Herald Of The Arc Light to search either of the Dogamtika Rituals and then benefit the Nekroz monsters with the search from Herald Of The Arc Light is really nice as well as Dogmatikalamity being able to send Herald Of The Arc Light in order to summon White Exalted of Dogmatika in the same way that Nekroz Kaleidoscope is another feature that is nice to have whilst also boosting the attack of something such as Nekroz of Unicore in order to make it more difficult to attack over in the process.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the deck does lose really hard to Droll &amp; Lock Bird but thankfully with the decline in popularity of Drytron in the current meta, Droll &amp; Lock Bird is being switched out for some other handtraps outside of combo decks that can use it and then proceed to put big bodies on the board and attempt to OTK you. I would do a combos section but your main thing is that you play whichever engine you draw while trying to get yourself to the other half of deck in the process through the use of Nadir Servant, Dogmatikalamity and Nekroz Kaleidoscope. Any other questions please feel free to ask. I do by no means think that this deck will be Tier 1, but it will certainly be able to deal with them in a Rouge capacity."

You don't need 3 Baby in this deck if you play correctly most of the time it won't be missed, some of the combos you can do with just one Babycerasarus. Archosaur has never required more than one copy in the deck and in this version even less, you only need to resolve Archosaur once in the game and I prefer to have Oviraptor and Scrap Raptor as Normal Summons. And speaking of Scrap engine you only need two Scrap Raptor and Chimera in the main deck, as I show in combos you can do full combo using only one Scrap Raptor.
Regarding the Ogdoadic engine what I see most people asking is why I use Aron instead of other better Ogdoadic cards and I know why they think Aron is bad because they play Ogdoadic and in the pure version strategy there are bosses much better monsters but in this version Aron fills the needs I need like the 5th name of Ogdoadic.
The extra deck I wouldn't change anything, each card helps me a lot, of course I would like to have room for more versatility cards like Lambda or Castel but for now I don't miss it.
The Side deck are just examples of good cards for you to dig and play in GY with the Chaos Ruler effect, it's not a real side deck although I think it's very good to test Mind Control and Bigfoot! mainly for being lv8, having 3k atk that takes a Dragoon for example and having the possibility to take out floodgates like Imperial Order and Anti-Spell.
Finally, on the gameplay of why the deck is interesting: Turn 1 you usually spend with what Dino does best which is Tyranno + Dolkka and what Ogdoadic does best which is a Rank8 but what makes this deck oppressor are the follow ups, on the way back you have the Scrap engine threatening Borreload Savage, you can have Chaos Ruler in the GY that along with the Ogdoadic engine threatens Dingirsu, you also easily threaten to do Exciton Knight, there's Misc + Rex that threaten Tyranno / Pankratops + a Rank4 which is giant in the grind game. So you generate so much advantage in GY that it's no use your opponent breaking your field, he'll have to OTK because otherwise your turn is scary. This is not the new secret deck that destroys the meta but I believe it is the best way to still play Dino besides being fun and requiring considerable skill because it is not linear, each combo I present can be done differently depending on from gamestate, there are times when you can connect only the Ogdoadic engine and the Dino engine is like Follow Up waiting for a draw to debrick or the other way around.

Below are all the combos I learned from this deck:
The basic deck combo is from the standard Scrap Dino moves like Oviraptor + Baby = Misc + Baby = Archosaur + Baby = Oviraptor + Misc
I hope you can understand the plays I made because some of these replays are not in a didactic way because they are more test hands that I do randomly mainly in the Scrap part which has more details of the cards I destroyed for each effect that activates or times I add the Double Evolution Pill to my hand out of the blue because I forgot to add it when using Archosaur, which are things you forget when training in a manual simulator.
I like to use the expression Cyber Punk 2077 when I find a really good combo that nobody does with the deck and you'll see I have some of them on this list.

Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus Dinosaur Ogdoadic Combo ROUTE of Chaos Ruler excavate Nunu = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Giant Rex + Number 38 or Dingirsu.
Using Chaos Ruler to access the Scrap engine is possible but it depends on luck if you can add Nunu or Nauya to your hand which I don't recommend.
Play Around Lightning Storm. Don't play Around Super Poly if you make Number 38.

Deck Full Combo - the apex using Chaos Ruler (not playing around hand trap) doing Evolzar Dolkka only in the middle of the combo = Tyranno + Dolkka + I:P + Number 97 and Number 38 + Possible Gamma in Hand that you can add with Chaos Ruler.
I was still using the Number 97 engine in this replay but nowadays I see that the Rank 8 Toolbox I use today is much better. I thought the idea presented in this combo was cool so I'm including it too.

Full Combo Cyber ​​Punk 2077 with 1 Scrap Raptor (Don't Playing Around Hand Traps) = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + Chimera + Number 38 or 68 or Dingirsu
(It's Combo Cyber ​​Punk 2077 because your Ultimate Conductor Tyranno is not just Book of Eclipse but a pop without targeting additionally because you destroy Scrap Chimera and Scrap Wyvern's eff trigger to give summon from Scrap Raptor that we still have in the deck to pop a card without targeting, that way you don't need to use Tyranno's effect so early in the combo)

Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Borreload Savage ROUTE = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Borreload Savage + Rank 8 /in Hand: Possible monster added with Chaos Ruler eff /in GY: Misc + half of the Ogdoadic names
(In this combo I Missplayed not to destroy the King of the Feral Imps after the summon of the second Scrap Raptor so I had an extra body on the table and I could do I:P Masquerena. I ask you to redo this combo because most likely this one I:P should not be on the final board, the rest of the monsters remain the same but there may be some significant change in the Ogdoadic activation sequence lv8)

(The second test hand with the Chaos Ruler ROUTE shows why it's a risky play, you may just not be able to dig out any Ogdoadic names and have the entire combo hurt)

Snake Rain + Scrap Raptor = Masquerena I:P + Bagooska /in GY: Chaos Ruler + all the Ogdoadic names /in Hand: Search of Chaos Ruler
(The first time I had summoned from Aron because of the autopilot but you must summon from Nauya to access Bagooska)

Snake Rain + Oviraptor the 3 possible situations:
First: Archosaur add Double Evolution Pill and make Linkuriboh + I:P Masquerena /in Hand: Double Evolution Pill + Ogdoadic Spell/Trap (discard of Knightmare Unicorn) /in GY: Misc + 3 ogdoadic names
Second: add Misc and let him down and pass with I:P Masquerena + Aron + an Ogdoadic Monster in the Hand (discard of Knightmare Unicorn) + Misc. (I was undecided about activating the spell Water Lily or the Nauya effect and after that I saw that it makes a lot more sense to use Spell in this case)
Third: Use Archosaur to add an Ogdoadic name and pass with I:P + Bagooska /in GY: Misc and all the Ogdoadic names. This combo is also possible if the Snake Rain dropout is a Reptile so you can add the Pill straight to the hand which is much better.

replay?id=813757-34766606
what do you do if you draw one of the bricks(Keurse or Aleirtt)? Simple, do the combo normally and at the end do Unicorn and use the eff to shuffle himself back to the extra deck and that way you can discard the Brick to the GY. This was a move that Adamancipator with Block Dragon did a lot, but in their case it wasn't to take a Brick from the deck, but to open space on the field to give summons from Block Dragon.
(In this combo I should have sent Nunu to GY instead of Aron because that way the Ogdoadic engine would be complete with the top 4 names in circulation)"

No problem! Rude opponent pass turn with an unpleasant break my board? Let's break it down!,"What if...We had ways to trigger main deck thunder dragons, using explosive cards and a lot of resources? That's what I'm Talking About!

The idea is originally to trigger the TD's using Invoked/Evil hero, but the prices aren't that acessible even right now with a reprint.

Then shaddolls came! And it solved everything, along with the monarch S/T engine to thin your deck. Need a boss monster? Odd-eyes advance dragon can burn your opponent removing threats, as well revive shaddolls and thunder dragons.

This is strictly supposed to play second, if you go first, at best you can tribute your opponent's monster to set a shaddoll beast.

Have fun!"

Honestly a welcome consistency card for getting to network as well since Lava Golem and Numeron Wall are both Fiends. There aren't many monsters in the deck so the lines of what gets to what are pretty simple.

Reveal Wall ----&gt; Ash ----&gt; Lava Golem and vice versa

Reveal Gadarla ----&gt; Lava Golem ----&gt; Vanity's Ruler or Ash or Wall

I am main decking Vanity's Ruler and Solemn Judgment because there's enough blowout cards to deal with basically any deck, so you have the room to just play going 1st cards as well in case someone figures out your strategy and thinks they can make you start. You don't need to do this, you can just play even more going 2nd cards if you wish.

As for the extra deck, I'd say the only cards you care about are the numerons obviously, the Apollousa, the Saryuja, and the Megaclops. Cards like Goddess seem good and can catch your opponent off guard, but Borrelcode and Zeroboros could be anything else that you prefer.

In the side, the only card of note is probably Link Bound, I found this card to be good at clearing monsters off of your field so you can activate network while also recycling a monster and potentially fixing your hand. You probably only ever want to see this card going 1st so that's why it's in the side."

","One of the best and most competitive meta decks in 2021, made in my way of dueling! I'm still not very best in Yu-Gi-Oh, but I'm trying to improve. I love play ultra-meta decks like this, and I'm learning how to make the strong, easy to play deck! In my version of this deck, we have all the Drytron architype cards, but also some old-school, but very strong and competitive cards, like Monster Reborn an Quaking Mirror Force. In the side deck, we have one of my favorite hand traps, Effect Veiler, and one more all-time old-school trap, Spellbinding Circle.

As you may know, zombies got some new synchros recently. 1 of them is a zombie synchro tuner that does a free foolish burial??? that one is insane, the others are ""kinda mid tbh"". So I did some experimenting and I found that with vampires and zombie world you can summon all three of these synchros on your opponent's turn if you really wanted to. I however decided that those synchros just aren't worth the extra deck space or the effort to summon them. If you want to use them go ahead, but I personally will just take Baroness De Fleur and call it a week. As always I don't list any 3 card combos, I leave those to the player to figure those out.

<span><strong>Notes:</strong></span>

-This deck is cyberbullied so badly by hand traps that they will literally never be meta. 9 times out of 10 you just hope to either open with crossout designator/called by the grave or your opponent has no hand traps. I wouldn't recommend playing this against a deck that plays a lot of hand traps/counter traps since there is only so much you can do to stop them

-If your wondering how to summon all the other new synchros with this deck, it mostly involves using formula synchron 3 times on your opponent's turn. Jack-O-Bolan/Hela and the level 10 synchro both can do that pretty easily, I don't do it cuz its a lot of extra deck space and only rlly performed through with 1 combo.

-If you have a level 5 or higher in your hand and Vampire Sucker on the field, try not to forget you can tribute your opponent's monsters for a tribute summon (while you have zombie world). If you can get Vampire Ghost Ogre in Grave you can do it on your opponent's turn.

-Swapping to TCG rules is easy, just remove 1 called by the grave and add 1 Crossout Designator

<span><strong>Conclusion:</strong></span>

I originally made this deck to keep up with my friends playing super strong meta decks and super strong combo decks. What ended up happening however is I found myself preferring to play Vampires with Vampire Kingdom over zombie world. That said,  Zombie World is definitely better and my friend plays eldlich so don't take my advice on which to play. The side deck is kinda thrown together, not much thought in it. I'm open to any advice, if you have an idea you should post it so others know too. Leave a like if you enjoyed the deck, and thanks for reading."

Wanted to post my first IRL deck to save it for future reference. I plan on adding Slime and more Kaijus/<a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber once I get them shipped to me.
