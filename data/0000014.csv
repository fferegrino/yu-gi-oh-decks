The archetype's main goal is to rapidly summon its Xyz Monsters and then use their effects to disrupt the opponent's field. The archetype also focuses on the use of its 3 main monsters as an easy way to search out its resources from the Deck or recycle them from the Graveyard, enabling repetitive looping of Xyz Summons to further field advantage.""

Also, You can easily keep your hand full of Constellars monsters. I Guess you could also Benefits from all Constellars XYZ Effects, Which Are:

Constellar Omega (Rank 4): Your Constellar Monsters aren't affected by your opponent spell or trap card till the end of either players turn.

&nbsp;

Constellar Praesepe (Rank 4): One Constellar monster gains 1000 Attack points, During either player turn, Till the end of that turn.

&nbsp;

Constellar Pleiades (Rank 5): Return one card on the field to its controller hand, during either player turn.

&nbsp;

Constellar Ptolemy M7 (Rank 6): You can XYZ this Monsters by using any XYZ  Constellar Monster you control as the XYZ material. Only during your turn, You can return one monster card from either player field or graveyard to its Owner Hand.-----------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

You may be asking ""What the hell is umbral have to do in this deck?!"" Well, the answer is a simple Trap Card Called ""Corrupted Keys"" Which Allow you To target An XYZ monster you control and summon Three Umbral Tokens (ATK:??,DEF:00) its attack is the attack of your XYZ Monster. They can't attack your opponent directly.

&nbsp;

You can use them to clean your opponent field of Monsters then attack directly with you XYZ Monster. Or you can easily tribute them to summon a high level Monster (Like An Egyptian God monster for example).

&nbsp;

This deck also has A variety of spell cards especially for this archetype.

&nbsp;

So, I was very, very surprised (and Angry) to notice that no one seems to use this amazing Archetype. With a little tweak here and there I made this deck very powerful.

&nbsp;

If anyone have anything to say (Good or bad) about this deck, please write. It will only help me make it much better."

You keep the opponent from using their extra deck, and have fairly great searching and even a card where you can tribute summon using one of the opponent's cards. The field spell lets the level eights count as a level six in hand, so it only takes one tribute, making ""The Monarchs Stormforth"" much more powerful.

Because two of these three play makers are at one, however, we have to get creative in alternative plays and consistency that doesn't harm this very specific combo deck. The Summoner Monk 'engine' provides a consistency boost in discarding dead spells (including Metalfoes Fusion, a spell that let's you draw 1 by shuffling it from the grave into the deck) to summon Armageddon Knight, which can dump a Farfa for some light removal or an Inzektor piece, or maybe a hopper to facilitate hornet, then make a rank 4 play.

You can use Book of Moon to unequip a graydle monster without losing the enemy monster, in case you need the S/T place or the monster in the GY.

If your Lose 1 Turn is on the field, you must fous on monster stealing only.

If your Skill Drain is on the field, don't use your tuners unless you are really sure its worth it. Combo a Graydle Dragon Synchro Summon with Skill Drain/Lose 1 Turn and Book of Moon for surprise 2-3 card destruction.

Cardcar D is for emergency or bad first hand only. Don't use it if you can do anything.

Thats all. Really simple strategy. Keep your opponent down."
