Another easy way to get Fusion of Fire is through Salamangreat Fennec's effect. In a lengthy game, Salamangreat Gift can be vital to sustaining Salamangreat Violet Chimera.

Of course you could improve this deck for TCG or OCG only purpose, making it more annoying for your opponent.  Even though it is doubting at the first glance this <strong>60 cards deck</strong> has a good composition of hand traps, effect negators, hand adders, destroyers, and attackers. I am sure you will rarely get band hands. Even if you feel you got one, this deck give you chance to stall until you have the opportunity to counter your opponent. <h4>How to Play This Deck</h4> This deck is optimal in the <strong>second turn,</strong> because if you run out of hand traps, you will often get cards destroyer to wipe out all your opponent's cards. However this deck also has the capability to go first, because you could summon some effect negators from extra deck whilst having hand traps in your hand.  To play this deck basically just negate your opponent's monster to <strong>stop combo</strong>, but if you fail just wipe them all using cards destroyer. If you fail to stop the combo and have no cards destroyer, you still have chance to make a <strong>come back</strong>.  This deck contains monsters which can be summoned easily, have high attack, and can be used to summon powerful monsters from extra deck. So you just need to summon all monster that could be special summoned. Starting from the one with deck search effect, to provoke you opponent to negate its effect. Then you will easily control the field even if your opponent successfully do his/her combo."

You can buy the Hero and Superpoly targets online for little money. The only expensive card in this deck is Borrelsword Dragon but it's not necessary and I simply had it lying around.  &nbsp;  The Hero cards help with the consistency of the deck. You want to normal summon Vyon, then send Shadow Mist to the graveyard and add Honest Neos for a light monster or another Vyon for a dark monster to your hand. Then you can use the effect of Vyon to get a Polymerization.  Mask Change II is my lucky one-off to summon Masked HERO dark law. This card won me quite some matches already.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  For combos you need to take advantage of the different Shaddoll graveyard effects. Typically you want to end up with Winda on the field to disturb the other player.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  This deck is fun to play and considering the cheap price it's pretty strong. Additionally you can easily improve the deck by integrating some more expensive cards."

Unofficial antagonists of the Egyptian Gods, the spectral members of this sacred trio have just been given powerful supports by Konami, allowing the deck to rise to a level of power never reached before. Quite unplayable in the past, mainly due to unreasonable summoning conditions, the new cards allow you to invoke your favorite demons in a much simpler way, through special summons, in order to unleash a blast of fury and wrath upon your opponent!  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/a/a0/DimensionFusionDestruction-OW.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20150819035729"" width=""422"" height=""422"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Fo</u></strong></span><span><strong><u>reword:</u></strong></span>  I would not say this deck is Tier 1, but it can definitely compete against actual meta decks, should you start the duel with a decent hand. Hence, Tier 2 to 3++ seems to be the right category in my opinion.  I know a lot of people do not appreciate the Dragun package which seems âunbalancedâ according to many players. Nevertheless, I decided to incorporate it as it makes wonders in the deck. One might argue Dragun is always splashable in any deck, but I tend to disagree with this statement. Sometimes, it is obvious Dragun is only there to fill a gap, or to pretend the deck is competitive. In this case, I can assure you Dragun deserves its place, and synergizes well with the board as I will explain later.  Last but not least, in order not to distort the deck too much and to keep its essence, I decided not to integrate the <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a> related combos. You can already watch TeamSamuraiX1 (<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpDgM_QHH5A&amp;t</a>) &amp; Yacine (<a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzp40uOF0IY</a>) latest videos on the topic if you want to play a more hybrid variation &amp; combo-focused version of the deck. <strong>I propose here a âpurerâ variant â¦ Â if one may use such a term to define a deck.</strong>  Having said that, letâs start the analysis!  <span><strong><u>Strengths:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Powerful Search Engine:</strong> Amazingly consistent thanks to <a data-name=""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"">The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a>. Various combos that I will showcase later contain searchable pieces.</li>  	<li><strong>Solid Draw Engine:</strong> The Pot of Greed of the deck, <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>, combined with <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> and <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> allows you to dig in your deck fairly easily.</li>  	<li><strong>Powerful Big &amp; Scary Beaters:</strong> With 4000 ATK &amp; DEF, your demons are nearly invincible in battle. Two direct attacks are all you need to lower your opponentâs life points to 0.</li>  	<li><strong>Consistent âMini-Lockdownâ Capabilities</strong>: Thanks to <a data-name=""Sacred Beast Awakening"">Sacred Beast Awakening</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>, you can set up very sticky board in turn one, quite hard to break.</li>  	<li><strong>Multiple Negates &amp; Interruptions:</strong> Dragun Engine, <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> for infinite spell/trap negate once per turn, <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a> to steal your opponentâs key monsters, <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a> for omni negate &amp; usual hand traps to disrupt their combos.</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Weaknesses:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li><strong>Huge inter-dependency: </strong>all the cards of your core engine synergize well with each other, but none of them is actually very powerful on its own. Your three âservantsâ need to be tributed. Your Sacred Beasts need to be protected. Your traps and spells need your Sacred Beasts to be activated.</li>  	<li><strong>Extra Deck under-exploited:</strong> <a data-name=""Armityle the Chaos Phantom"">Armityle the Chaos Phantom</a>Â looks badass, but it is actually terrible. There is no Boss Monster related to the Sacred Beast that could have a meaningful impact on the game. Extra deck is mainly used for Dragun, Super Poly targets &amp; Knightmare package, that is, generic extra-deck cards.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Uria, Lord of Searing Flames"">Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</a>:</strong> Unfortunately for us, special summoning Uria often means 0 ATK/DEF if you do not have any continuous trap in grave. Even though it has the best effect among all demons, its stats are too bad for us to incorporate this card in the deck.</li>  	<li><strong><a data-name=""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms"">Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder"">Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</a> effects:</strong> these phantasms might be tough, there effects are mediocre, and you will not rely on them to develop your strategy. Ravielâs token can help you link summon, but it wonât come up very often.</li>  	<li><strong>Weaker when going 2nd:</strong> All your âBeastâ related cards are basically oriented towards turn 1 play. They cannot disrupt your opponent. They search, they protect themselves &amp; build a defense, but they do not counter actively your opponent.</li>  	<li><strong>Your Graveyard:</strong> Particularly sensitive to hand traps &amp; other effects that prevent you from using effects in grave (<a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a>, Seven Gates 2nd effect).</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/5f/bc/6b5fbca525bb7da5747a7067b2a02d94.png"" width=""470"" height=""470"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>S</u></strong><strong><u>trategy:</u></strong></span>  <span><strong><u>Going Second: </u></strong></span>  If you lose the dice roll, try to bait your opponent before activating Seven Gate or Beckoning. If you manage to activate properly one of these and to further develop your board with one Beast and <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>, you might have a chance to win. Against multiple negates though, it will be practically impossible to break the opponentâs board on game one <strong>if you do not draw <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>. With this fusion spell, you can usually make some sweet and disgusting come backs (<a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> anyone?).  <span><strong><u>Going First:</u></strong></span>  <strong>Powerful Combo:</strong> there is multiple combinations to achieve same end-result depending on your opening hand, but you basically need at least Beckoning OR Seven Gates in hand plus two cards among the following to make it happen: Seven Gates (if you have Beckoning already) / Beckoning (if you have Seven Gates already) / Dark Beast / Chaos Beast / Awakening  <strong>Concrete Example:</strong> <a data-name=""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"">The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed</a> / <a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a> / <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a> <ul>  	<li>Play Seven Gates, search for Beckoning</li>  	<li>Play Beckoning, search for Awakening</li>  	<li>Use Beckoning 2nd effect to tribute itself for Dark Beast</li>  	<li>Use Dark Beast effect to special summon Hamon (or Raviel)</li>  	<li>Banish Dark Beast from grave to search for the other Sacred Beast</li>  	<li>Use Seven Gates 2nd effect to send Chaos Beast to grave and ss it</li>  	<li>Use Chaos Beast effect to ss the Sacred Beast from hand (by tributing itself)</li>  	<li>Banish Chaos Beast from grave to search for Fallen Paradise</li>  	<li>Activate Paradise to draw two cards</li>  	<li>Set Awakening</li> </ul> <strong>Minimum End Board aka âMini Lockdownâ:</strong> Two Sacred Beasts + Fallen Paradise (= Sacred Beasts not targetable &amp; cannot be destroyed by card effects) + Activate Awakening on opponentâs turn (= Better than Skill Drain: negate all monster effects activated on YOUR opponentâs side of the field).  <strong>Very Important:</strong> if looking at your hand, you realize you wonât be able to gather two Sacred Beasts + Awakening, you should definitely go for plan B, involving the Dragun package (if you did not draw the red-eyes fusion of course). Indeed, having a 2nd Beast on the field does not bring you any specific advantage &amp; edge against your opponent (without the trap), compared to the strength of the Dragun alone. I wonât lie to you, you will see this combo way more often than the previous one, as it is quite hard to gather all the pieces in hand for the lockdown. Thatâs one of the reasons this deck is not Tier 1 by the way. However, the Plan B is also a power play, and will give your opponent a hard time to deal with it.  <strong>Plan B: </strong>Once again, there is multiple ways to establish a board involving Dragun. I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the sequencing (combo order) by practicing with test hands. Here is one powerful combo:  Beckoning + Seven Gates + Hamon in hand: <ul>  	<li>Play Seven Gates, search for Chaos Beast</li>  	<li>Play Beckoning, search for <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a></li>  	<li>Use Beckoning 2nd effect to normal summon Chaos Beast</li>  	<li>Use Chaos Beast effect to special summon Hamon from hand <strong>in ATK position</strong></li>  	<li>Use Seven Gates 2nd effect to send <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> to grave and revive back Chaos Beast</li>  	<li>Link Beckoning and Chaos Beast into <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a></li>  	<li>Use Anaconda effect to fusion summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></li>  	<li>Use Seven Gates 2nd effect to retrieve <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> from grave and activate it</li>  	<li>Use Chaos Beast Effect to search for <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a></li> </ul> <strong>Minimum End Board: </strong>Hamon + Cerulean Sky Fire (= First negate) + Dragun (= 2nd Negate + 2 monsters to destroy on your turn) + Fallen Paradise (= 2 cards + extra protection)  As you can see, <a data-name=""R&lt;a data-name=&quot;Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon&quot;&gt;ed-Eyes Dark Dragoon&lt;/a&gt;"">R</a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">ed-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> enables you to effectively use all resources available on board when you do not open with every piece of your optimal combo. It is not just a desperate addition to the deck in a vain attempt to foul you with some dubious competitive garbage!  <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/8/80/Series048.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20120909191014"" width=""524"" height=""393"" alt=""image"" />  <span><strong><u>Tips:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>Be very cautious when using <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>. Make sure you do not need to play<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Â </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> first, before banishing a part of the package by accident and make a fool of yourself ;)</li>  	<li>Always think about the right sequencing before starting the combo &amp; know the right timing to draw (try to skim your deck, so that you do not draw combo pieces you could have searched first!).</li>  	<li>Always play <a data-name=""Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder"">Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</a> in ATK mode in case you draw <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a>. This a requirement to activate its negation effect.</li>  	<li>Do not forget Ravielâs effect which summons a dark token each time your opponent NORMAL summons a monster. Can be useful sometimes â¦ but can also backfire as it is a dark attribute token (<a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: âHere I come!â).</li>  	<li>Keep in mind if you have two Hamon in defense position on your side of the field, your opponent cannot attack you.</li>  	<li>If you happen to have Dragun + Super poly on board, remember you need TWO cards in hand in order to activate both effects.</li>  	<li>Do not forget the second effect of Seven Gates, which can retrieve a continuous spell from the graveyard (either another Seven Gates, or more importantly, <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a>).</li>  	<li>Bear in mind that summoning a Sacred Beast through <a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a> effect will <strong>cancel your next battle phase</strong>, so remember to attack first if you can.</li>  	<li>Seven Gates can only search for a MONSTER that specifically list any of the Sacred Beasts while Beckoning can search for any CARD etc...</li>  	<li>If you do not need <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> (they are obviously bricks when drawn), try to recycle them with <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>.</li> </ul> <span><strong><u>Rational behind Ratios:</u></strong></span> <ul>  	<li>42 cards instead of 40. I usually prefer to reduce the number of cards in my deck to 39 + 1 <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> for consistencyâs sake, but this time, due to the Dragun package, Iâd rather make a 42 cards deck (41+1) and reduce the odds of drawing one of the two major bricks in the deck (<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>). Hence the (39+1) deck core + 2 bricks. It would be interesting to run a probably test in order to check what would be the optimal ratio that would minimize the chances to draw these bricks, while not decreasing that much the odds of drawing other key cards. Of course, such study would be based on a certain number of subjective hypotheses â¦</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> and 2x <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>: You do not want to play Pot into another Pot, so 2 is fine. Allure at 3 would be a little too much in my opinion, as most of the time, you want to send your Dark monsters to the grave, not banish them.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Dark Summoning Beast"">Dark Summoning Beast</a>: the worst of the three ""servants"". It is a level 5 and therefore requires a tribute. If I had no Pot of Desires, I would only play one.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder"">Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder</a> and 2x <a data-name=""Raviel, Lord of Phantasms"">Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</a>, because one is not enough and can be banished by Desires / Maybe 3x Hamon would be worth considering for late game. I happen to need it sometimes.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>: not 3 because the deck also runs one Red-Eyes Fusion â¦ and you need space. Plus, you can activate it through Verte Ananconda if you really need it.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Cerulean Sky Fire"">Cerulean Sky Fire</a> &amp; 1x Sacred Beast Awakening because they both are searchable, and you do not want to open multiple copies of these cards as they donât do much on their own (remember the dependency weakness I mentioned before).</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a>: big target for your opponent who will try to get rid of it. One extra copy to avoid running out of draw power. 3x is too much because it is easily searchable.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Dark Beckoning Beast"">Dark Beckoning Beast</a> / <a data-name=""Chaos Summoning Beast"">Chaos Summoning Beast</a> / <a data-name=""The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed"">The Seven Spirit Gates Unleashed</a>: best cards of the deck. You always want to open them first (Chaos Beast to a lesser extent though).</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Called By the Grave"">Called By the Grave</a> to go through your entire combos.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> is a tech choice: enables me to retrieve Cerulean Sky Fire or another Seven Gates if I already got one Seven Gates on the field. You could potentially replace it with a <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> if you prefer to send a monster directly to the grave.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>: standard hand trap / You can replace it by any hand trap depending on the meta. I chose the most generic one.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Crackdown"">Crackdown</a>: this is very debatable / tech choice again. it is a strong going 1st trap to set, your opponent will most likely not see it coming and it is pretty good to shut down combos. It requires extensive metagame knowledge when it comes to deciding which monster needs to be stolen. You could swap it for <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> / <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> / <a data-name=""Red Reboot"">Red Reboot</a> / <a data-name=""Dimensional Barrier"">Dimensional Barrier</a> etc â¦ Crackdown never fails me except in one particular scenario: it is sensitive to anti-target effects!</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>: omni negate â¦ what else do you want? Take my mon.. life points!</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>: works as an âextenderâ &amp; can save you sometimes by special summoning a Chaos Beast to start off a combo (still giving you access to your normal summon). Also to consider as a potential bait, because it is a threatening card for your opponent (currently limited in the banlist).</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>: not quite sure about this one. I have mixed feelings. Enable to fix very bad hands, but useless in late game. You could replace it with another Allure.</li> </ul> <img class="""" src=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/5/5a/Series150.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121029025225"" alt=""Yu-Gi-Oh!

Chain Kagemucha knight to prevent play-makers from being negated by hand traps. Add instant fusion to hand using Ophrys to further gain card advantage. Use Leviair to set up board and use them to rank up into Utopic Future Dragon. Can go for Beatrice or Cicada King depending on if you have a Burning Abyss in hand. End board with Predaplant Verte and fuse Dragun of Red Eyes. You can alternatively use instant fusion to summon Millenium Eyes Restrict while Cherubini is on board to protect it from destruction.

Use Cyber Revsystem, Cyber Emergency, and Galaxy Soldier to help get a lot of monsters on the field. From there, link summon Sieger (Where applicable), however prioritize summoning Cyber Dragon Nova and bringing out Infinity for effect negation. Other cards can help support and speed you up or slow down the opponent,  The Side Deck is optimized against Fusion or Swarm (the deck type, not the archetype) decks. Super Polymerization can easily take out boss monsters - specifically, Salamangreat ones - quickly. De-fusion can disrupt the strategy very well and Non-Fusion Area will stop Fusion altogether. The rest of the cards are against Swarm Link decks. Skill Drain can negate the continuous effect(s) of a boss monster and you can bring it down with a Power Bond combo. Phantazmay and Summon Limit will severely hinder their ability to swarm and summon high Link Ratings.

Trying my layout to be as disruptive to hand traps and backrow as possible. Still experimenting with the deck. There aren't a lot of great Rock cards outside of the Tuners and Koa'ki Meiru Guardian, but I wanted at least 12 Earth Rocks as fuel for the deck, so I'm running 3 Gate Blocker. It'll help disrupt hand traps that target, and also makes removal annoying, and also turns of field spells. While Mystic Mine is the common application, in this meta it becomes a target both Rokket decks have to clear off of the field (if they don't find extenders).  I like the Danger! package a lot, actually. When you get ""unlucky"" it can deck thin for free, and they always equal an extra monster on the board with their effects. Not being tuners is harsh, but their levels (3 and 7) are actually useful with the earth Tenyi Spirit. Even if Dragite isn't on, going full combo with a Dragite on the board is insane.  You might actually play the crystals once Block Dragon and Linkross are gone. Koa'ki Meiru Supplier is also going to make the cut when it comes to the TCG, it would easily replace the Danger Package in the current build (running Clara and Rushka).  I decided to drop the Danger Package, not being Earth monsters combined with the RNG made them unreliable. Instead, I'm running Madolche Petingcessoeur. The reason for the Token Collector main is so that your hand traps don't disrupt Petincessoeur going second. You could also run Gamma, but I hate running any brick that isn't a rock monster in this deck. As a result, I have to run Gallant Granite as a back-up starter. I'm back to Soldier of Chaos. The deck needs a good Link follow-up play to make with Block Dragon, and it doubles as a tool against Eldlich. It also theoretically helps break boards going second, though generally the deck does that well enough with Dragite and Accesscode.  So far, Sekka's light has been insane, way more powerful than One For One and Monster Reborn in the deck. You never see it with Foolish, and when you do see both you still have your choice of a Sekka's Light if you want to +1 by drawing 3 cards OR a guaranteed Block Dragon (usually the call). I think Sekka's Light is okay with 1 spell, but I'd feel increasingly nervous with every spell you add. This is why we need to go the Petincessoeur route instead of Unexpected Dai.  Trying this version now, with the Buster lock and Revival golem. Only 12 Rocks in this deck, but that's fine while Block Dragon is legal I think. The Prank Kids engine will help a lot once Meow Meow is legal. (Also I'll get to say Doodoo Doodle Doo a lot.)"

Consistent 3 mats Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon with Fog Blade/Red-Eyes Fang with Chain online just ","Your favorite character Joey Wheeler and Yuto cards combined making this deck strong. Easy 3 materials Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon with its effect online and Red-Eyes Slash Dragon equipped with Fang with Chain, also with a chance for Fog Blade because Phantom Knight can search it instead if you draw the Rank-Up-Magic. This deck is using Dragon Link engine (too many cards banned, I dont think dragon link is even playable in world banlist), <strong>Romulus + 1 random extender</strong> to be exact. Combo is super long,<a> click here for combo tutorial replay</a>.  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/dALRFKF.png"" alt=""image"" />  The Dragon Link engine is focusing on Black Metal Dragon for card advantage (because it's so hard without Elpy, Linkross, and Agarpain), so we play 3 Where Arf Thou/Magicians' Souls (Souls because our extender doesnt have to be dragon) and One for One. Souls are paired with Exodius because it doesnt need discard like Apprentice Illusion Magician. Codebreaker engine is there to accomodate the advantage loss from banned Agarpain, Elpy, and Linkross. We dont use Halq combo because no Linkross and Auroradon locks us from Codebreaker/Verte play. The side deck is mainly removal card because this deck cant break board inherently, Kaiju Slumber is nice as it wipes monster and gives us extender.  Pros: Themed, consistent cus using Dragon Link, big body, multiple negations with backrows, has recursion from Red-Eyes Spirit reviving REDMD.  Cons: 2 cards combo, Dragon Link isnt as strong in World/OCG banlist, only has monster negation/disruption, has deadly brick like Red-Eyes Fusion.

The objective of the deck is to get 4 harpies on the board. Doing this allows you to do the following combo Link 2 into Romulus Equip Divine Lance Equip and Summon Phalanx Link Phalanx and 1 Harpie for Union Carrier Link Romulus and other Harpie for Simorgh Equip Thunderbird to Simorgh with Carrier Summon Avian in End Phase off Simorgh  If you can only make 3 Harpies: Link 2 into Conductor Link into Simorgh Summon Avian in end phase  With The new synchro, it's best to use it when you know your opponent is going to have a mix deck of monsters and spells/traps, and is good for bouncing indestructibles(good for golden lord after summoned by own effect)  Also keep in mind that Simorgh protects winged beasts it points to from target effects"

I actually named this deck ""The Power"", after that magic keyboard from the Cartoon Network masterpiece Regular Show.
