Update 3/19/21: I have made a few changes, for one limited cards in the main deck are marked by one for one and unlimited cards are marked by TTT, neither of these cards are on the list itself, but are there as organizational tools

Update 3/21: cutting droll off, and adding a few more unbans
<h2>Banned:</h2>
<h3>Monsters:</h3>
<a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>, This just deletes all interaction when you play against dinos

<a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, I believe that if a card gets more cards banned because of it, then it's the real problem card and should go

<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, This limits the design of fusion spells and monsters going forward and I don't like that, I also want rainbow neos turbo to be fun again.

<a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a>, dragons are too good and this card is busted and needs to go
<h3>Spells:</h3>
<a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> - This card is one of the most degenerate cards in the game, it just deletes all fun and interaction from the game

<a data-name=""The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch"">The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch</a>, This limits the designs of DARK XYZ monster going forward and it just kinda shouldn't have been unbanned in the first place
<h3>Traps:</h3>
<a data-name=""Skill drain"">Skill drain</a> - This card is just kind of broken due to it basically making it required to have an out in the for of backrow to stop (if a floodgate can't be outed by Phoenix, it shouldn't be in the game)

<a data-name=""The Monarchs erupt"">The Monarchs erupt</a> - same reasons as Skill drain, but in some cases just better
<h2>Limited (or to one):</h2>
<h3>Monsters:</h3>
<a data-name=""Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos"">Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos</a> - this card isn't all that good, it's one of the worst dragon rulers and having it at one will probably just be a cool thing for volcanics

<a data-name=""Destrudo, the Lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo, the Lost Dragon's Frisson</a> - Honestly, this card got banned for no reason, yes it makes halq, but so does basically every single deck right now, I just want to make dawn dragster in BA again

<a data-name=""Astrograph Sorcerer"">Astrograph Sorcerer</a>, Pend isn't good and this card won't change it

<a data-name=""Performapal Skullcrobat Joker"">Performapal Skullcrobat Joker</a>, Pend is still not good

<a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror</a> - orcust is garbage, at this point nothing less than a mermaid unban would really matter

<a data-name=""Lunalight Tiger"">Lunalight Tiger</a>, most of the degenerate stuff this card has enabled has been hit in some way

<a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> - This card also was banned for no reason, putting it to one would do nothing

<a data-name=""Elder Entity Norden"">Elder Entity Norden</a> - instant fusion is limited, this card can come back

<a data-name=""Salamangreat Miragestallio"">Salamangreat Miragestallio</a>, Salad is garbage and this card won't change much

<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>, this is to check deep-draw decks

<a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing</a>, this is a good card, but I don't think it's good enough today to see any play.
<h3>Spells:</h3>
<a data-name=""Quick Launch"">Quick Launch</a>, E-tele is at one and this card is better than E-tele 90% of the time (it isn't even OPT)

<a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a> - Feather duster is just better than this card, having more backrow removal wouldn't hurt anyone

<a data-name=""Change of heart"">Change of heart</a> - this card would just be a decently strong turn 2 card, I don't think it would be all that bad

<a data-name=""Fossil dig"">Fossil dig</a> - Dinos don't need better ROTA

<a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a>, I like invokeds, but it is getting kinda stale

<a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a>, See the card above

<a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a>, This is a hit to dogma because that could get out of hand fast

<a data-name=""That Grass Looks Greener"">That Grass Looks Greener</a>, I just think this would be funny
<h3>Traps:</h3>
<a data-name=""Ultimate offering"">Ultimate offering</a> - it's probably too slow to really matter, and I think it would be funny

<a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> - another degenerate floodgate, it's not the worst so I'll only limit it

<a data-name=""Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine"">Eldlixir of Scarlet Sanguine</a>, eld is kinda boring these days, so a slap on the wrist would be good
<h2>Off The List:</h2>
<h3>Monsters:</h3>
<a data-name=""Master Peace, the true dracoslaying king"">Master Peace, the true dracoslaying king</a> - this card is just bad now, it wouldn't see much play and it's way too easy to out

<a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a> - This is just a cool going second card that was limited for no real reason

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"">Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon</a>, I think enough damage to dragons has been done for this to come off

<a data-name=""True King Lithosagym, the Disaster,"">True King Lithosagym, the Disaster,</a> Dinos got hit hard too, so I'll throw them a bone

<a data-name=""Infernity Archfiend"">Infernity Archfiend</a>, This card is not a problem

<a data-name=""Dinomight Knight, the true dracofighter"">Dinomight Knight, the true dracofighter</a> - Draco is bad, this would do nothing

<a data-name=""Double iris magician"">Double iris magician </a>- for as much as we meme about PEND BEST DECK LET'S GOOOOO, it's pretty bad in all honesty

<a data-name=""Yata Garasu"">Yata Garasu </a>- this card is just bad now, the yata lock is near impossible to pull off now

All the tuners banned because of Halq, Noodl is gone so these can come back

<a data-name=""Night Assailant,"">Night Assailant,</a> This card is too slow to matter nowadays

the jars, these are too slow to matter now

<a data-name=""Speedroid Terrortop,"">Speedroid Terrortop,</a> this is a bit suspect, but I do think this could come back, I can only really see this be used to either insulate combos from nibiru, or to make cherubini. If you can show me a combo that breaks this card, I will not have it on here.

<a data-name=""Tellarknight Ptolemaeus"">Tellarknight Ptolemaeus</a> - isn't good any more, turn one CDI isn't as broken as it used to be

<a data-name=""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier,"">Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier,</a> This card isn't a problem

<a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral,"">Daigusto Emeral,</a> this card has seem little to no play
<h3>Spells :</h3>
<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> - evenly is a three so why can't this be

<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a> - won't do much but make infernoids more funny

<a data-name=""Called by the grave"">Called by the grave</a> - This card's limit was a mistake, it can come back

<a data-name=""Dimensional fissure"">Dimensional fissure</a> - this is fine really, I don't think it will be a big deal

<a data-name=""Symbol of heritage"">Symbol of heritage</a> - it's a more situational living fossil

<a data-name=""A hero lives"">A hero lives</a>, Heroes aren't good

<a data-name=""Draco Face-Off,"">Draco Face-Off,</a> This would do nothing

<a data-name=""Sekka's light"">Sekka's light</a>, This card promotes an interesting play style I want to see again

<a data-name=""Mind control"">Mind control</a>, This card has no real reason to be limited, going second is still bad

<a data-name=""Trickstar Light Stage"">Trickstar Light Stage</a>, This was limited because of orcust, it can come back now

<a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus,"">Gold Sarcophagus,</a> This won't do much, thunder won't be too crazy

<a data-name=""Chain Strike"">Chain Strike</a>, Chain burn has been dead for a long time

<a data-name=""Slash Draw"">Slash Draw</a>, Skull Dread is at one so this doesn't do anything anymore

<a data-name=""Card destruction"">Card destruction</a>, it's a -1 that has no real use today
<h3>Traps:</h3>
<a data-name=""Macro Cosmos"">Macro Cosmos</a> - like DiFi this could come back no problem

<a data-name=""Red Reboot,"">Red Reboot,</a> this stops trap decks and does nothing else

<a data-name=""Wall of revealing light"">Wall of revealing light</a>, Battle traps are bad and last turn doesn't exist anymore

<a data-name=""Time Seal"">Time Seal</a> - this card is just awful, it won't see any play

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you think I'm wrong then send me a decklist proving it, also I didn't have the space for firewall, but we all know that's coming off.

<strong>Objetivo:</strong> Acabar con la vida del oponente usando a Chronomaly Atlandis y Agent Saturn OwO.

<strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;https://youtu.be/4Df67balYJc&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

<strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>

Para iniciar el combo necesitamos tener en mano a Drytron Alpha, Drytron Zeta y Cyber Angel Benten (o uno de los ""ladrillos"")

<strong>Searchers para buscar los requisitos</strong><strong>:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Where Arf Thou: </strong>Sirve para añadir un Drytron cuando ya hay uno en el campo. Ya que el uso de Alpha y Zeta es intercambiable, sirve para buscar a cualquiera de los dos.</li>
 	<li><strong>Jack in the Hand: </strong>Debe ser usado primero por ser algo impredecible. Usualmente escogeremos a Alpha, Zeta y Gamma. Si el oponente toma a Alpha o Zeta, escogemos al otro. Si toma a Gamma, no hay problema, ya que llevamos otra copia, y además escogemos al Drytron que necesitamos.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cyber Emergency: </strong>Literalmente trae a la mano cualquier Drytron.</li>
 	<li><strong>Foolish Burial:</strong> Cuando hablamos de Drytron, el cementerio y la mano son casi lo mismo.</li>
 	<li><strong>Drytron Nova:</strong> Trae a cualquier Drytron al campo, el cual puedes enviar al cemenerio al usarlo para invocar a Linkuriboh.</li>
 	<li><strong>Drytron Fafnir: </strong>Añade a Nova a la mano.</li>
 	<li><strong>Preparation of Rites: </strong>Sirve para traer a Benten a la mano.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ritual Sanctuary: </strong>Trae a Benten a coste de descartar una magia, que en este deck, hay de sobra.</li>
 	<li><strong>Terraforming: </strong>Es el más versátil, ya que puede traer a Fafnir (si necesitas un Drytron) o a Ritual Sanctuary (si necesitas a Benten).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Ladrillos:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>The Agent of Judgement - Saturn: </strong>Con él rematamos al oponente, además que al invocarse, activa el efecto de Benten.</li>
 	<li><strong>Soul of Purity and Light: </strong>Con ella tendremos los materiales necesarios para invocar a Chronomaly Atlandis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Zeradias, Herald of Heaven: </strong>Descartándolo, tendremos The Sanctuary in the Sky.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Sanctuary in the Sky:</strong> Es necesario para resolver el efecto de Agent Saturn.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>
 	<li>No tiene garnets, y el único ladrillo verdadero es Drytron Meteornis, por lo que todo es útil.</li>
 	<li>Puede baitear Impermanence y Veiler en Mu-Beta Fafnir si tienes un buscador extra para Gamma.</li>
 	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li>
 	<li>Versátil. Es fácil de añadir los requisitos al estar el Deck lleno de buscadores.</li>
 	<li>Si todo falla, con los cuerpos en campo se puede hacer invocaciones Link poderosas (como Masquerena-&gt;Kurnugias en turno del oponente), ya que el combo no usa todo el extra deck</li>
</ul>
<strong>Contras:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, puede que toque puro Drytron o puro Benten/ladrillo, en cuyo caso es gg.</li>
 	<li>El deck depende de que tú y el oponente tengan los mismos LP al inicio. Si el oponente consigue aumentar sus LP o quemar la tuya, el combo no funcionará.</li>
 	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>
 	<li>La prioridad para traer a los ladrillos es muy importante. Siempre es Saturn &gt; Soul of Purity &gt; Zeradias. Saturn no puede ser el último, ya que su invocación activa un Benten, si nos olvidamos de él, es gg. Soul of Purity es necesario para traer a Atlandis, el cual se activa antes que Saturn, y aunque es posible invocar a Saturn antes que a Atlandis, no es así si hemos baiteado un Veiler con Mu-Beta Fafnir. Zeradias sólo es necesario al final de todo, por lo que no es tan importante para realizar los combos.</li>

An Ojam-Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon deck that uses its side deck to pivot into an Ojam-A-to-Z deck,"<strong>Two Decks for the Price of One!</strong>

The main deck is all about using the Armed Dragon and Ojama engine to turbo out our boss monster, <a data-name=""Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon"">Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon</a>. The side deck switches up the gameplan by focusing on an entirely different boss monster, <a data-name=""A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon"">A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon</a>.

For those of you that already have a copy or have a little extra money sitting around, you may want to consider running <a data-name=""Armed Dragon LV10"">Armed Dragon LV10</a> instead of <a data-name=""Armed Dragon Thunder LV10"">Armed Dragon Thunder LV10</a>. Both are powerful so it's really just a matter of your meta and personal preference.

Spellbook: Use the cards to rack up spell counters and draw cards

Supreme king/  <span>Guardragon Elpy Combo: Use Supreme king Dragon Darkwurm to Get supreme king gate zero on the field, then use that to pendulum so you can get out selene</span>

Endymion: Use Servant Of Endymion to rack up spell counters to summon <span>Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic, so you can go into selene and complete your combos</span>

Mythical Beast: This Deck uses these cards to negate, quickly summon, and get some easy spell counters on the field. Make sure when you get Jackel on the field you activate a spell so you can negate any board

Tips: If you hand has a Endymion Pendulum Card (which is probably going to happen ) you always place that down first then activate you spell so you can get more spell counter

If you get Servant you activate that in the pendulum zone before you active any other cards

Remember if you don't end on either <span>Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic, Mythical Beast Master Cerberus, or a link-3 monster you misplayed</span>"

<b>BANLIST NOTICE (IMPORTANT)</b>

&nbsp;

<span>If something in this deck were to get hit on the March 2021 banlist (very unlikely), it will not be something major. The worst thing that can possibly happen would be a sanguine semi limit or a eldland semi limit or a tenki limit. NONE OF THESE DO ANYTHING TO THIS DECK. If something were to happen, I’ll make sure to update the list after the banlist with the minor changes. If tenki were to get hit (unlikely - did not even get hit in the zoo format) - just play more zoo bodies. If sanguine gets hit, just play an extra white or black elixdir (depends on play style) and if eldland were to get hit, just play how many ever copies of it as possible and fill up space in the main deck with handtraps. I will update the deck when the banlist drops so do not fret. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Why administrator is OP (In this deck)</b><span> - </span>

&nbsp;

<span>The deck is not running the entire amazement package. It is running the absolute minimum to keep this deck in the meta tier. This is better than the basic zoo eldlich build because this can put up more interruptions. For the amazement cards we are playing 3 Amazement Administrator and 3 of the amazement attraction horror house (the one with the book of moon effect) and that is all. Administrator is OP because of how much it can disrupt the opponent, break boards and generate advantage. Yes, that 1 card can do all of that. Administrator can special summon itself when a trap is activated. Then, it can equip the attraction trap from the deck onto an opponent's monster to flip it face down. Now since the monster is facedown, the equip card goes to the GY (equip cards go to the GY if the target it is equipped to leaves the field or is flipped face down) so the trap will be in the GY. Then you can banish the trap from the grave to destroy a card on the field! It is any card on the field, monster or back row, face up or face down!! On top of all of that you have a monster on the field to link off into (depending on your situation) one of the knightmares or even Black luster Soldier!! When you draw it with imperm or if your opponent plays any kind of trap that can activate itself turn 1, making it a VERY high impact handtrap. It can also use it’s removal effect during your turn and be liked for more devastation. When you go first, since the deck has so many traps, it just adds up to your negates and makes it easier to OTK next turn with the removal and since it can be linked. This card literally brings the whole package. </span>

&nbsp;

</ul>
</td>
<td><span>For the amazement cards we are playing 3 Amazement Administrator and 3 of the amazement attraction trap card and that is all. The trap negates an opponent’s monster’s effect or flips a monster the opponent controls face down based on which monster it is equipped to. The monster (administrator) can summon itself when a trap is activated (when either player activates a trap) as a quick effect (can be done on opponent’s turn) and it can also equip a monster on the field with an attraction trap (quick effect). This makes it a handtrap essentially and can also cause more damage next turn by banishing the attraction trap you equipped from the graveyard to use administrators’ removal effect (assuming the monster you equipped the card to left the field). The trap (if drawn without the monster) is not a brick because it is basically a book of moon and can simply be set like any other trap. You can also resolve administrator constantly going 1st and second for an high impact negate. If the opponent is playing some kind of trap based deck that administrator can come in clutch. </span></td>

<td><span>I am playing 3 Ramram (2000 defense and protects you against dangerous traps) and 2 Whiptail (can attach itself and has the removal effect that banishes) for the monsters. 5 is more than enough and there are plenty of ways to search these. For spells I am playing 3 Tenki (can search any zoo) and 1 barrage (can pop itself to special a zoo from the deck). In total that is 9 cards to search zoo monsters and that is ≈ ¼ of the deck. You should expect a zoo monster in hand in about 1 in 4 cards which is the ideal ratio. Tenki is really good with eldlich since it is a continuous spell. It can be sent to the GY to bring back golden boy with 3500 attack. </span></td>

<td><span>I am playing 2 Golden lord for the monsters (Obviously the only eldlich monster). For Spells I am playing 3 Eldland (only good eldlich spell).

This is just the standard eldlich ratio, no explanation needed there. </span></td>

<td><span>By this I mean traps that do not go with eldlich or amazement. For this I am playing 3 Imperm (is a handtrap as well), 3 solemn strike (high impact negation, is also a counter trap) and 2 Dinomischus (great removal and can bring itself back from the GY to use as link material). All of these are to set and interrupt the opponent. </span></td>

</ul>
</td>
<td><span>I am playing 3 ash (counter literally anything) and 3 imperm (is not only a real trap but a handtrap as well). Yes I know I included imperm in both categories. Imperm is a good option because if you activate it, it lets you bring out administrator turn 1 (opponent’s turn) and you can equip the attraction trap using administrator to an opponent’s monster later in the turn for a high impact disruption!!

<b>The extra deck</b><span> -</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The extra deck is just 2 of every zoodiac monster (except drident which is limited) and 2 zeus for the xyz (zoodiac) package. For the links you have Knightmare Phoenix (pops backrow), Knightmare Unicorn (shuffles), Black Luster Soldier (OTK) and Barricageborg Blocker (recycle). </span><b>Notice all the link monsters do not list effect monsters as materials so you can link the golden land traps into them as well. </b>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b><span> -</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The deck is very strong overall and is definitely a tier 1 contender in the current metagame. The amazement cards do not change how the deck is played, it is just an extra mechanic that the deck uses to make it more powerful. Amazement makes this deck better in a number of ways and that is why this deck is Amazing!</span>

It won’t top any tournaments or anything like that, but it is a fun","<span>Welcome to my updated Abhyss list!! The new spell just dropped and it is really good. It is basically a foolish burial for any reptile and can also serve as a monster reborn if you have 5 or more reptiles in the GY. Getting the reptiles in the graveyard is fairly easy using snake rain, aka the painful choice of the deck. The new spell can also be searched VERY easily and can be used to summon the big level 8 Abhyss monsters from the GY without having to tribute monsters!! I am playing a level 8 (and kind of level 4) focused deck since all the abhyss monsters are either level 4 or 8. This deck is more focused on level 8’s than 4’s. For level 8 support (8-axis) we are playing 3 danger! Bigfoot!, 3 danger! Thunderbird!, 3 trade-in (staple), 3 alpha, 3 sea turtle kaiju, 3 sticky string kaiju and all of the level 8 abhyss monsters. This is a going 2nd OTK based deck purely focused on breaking boards and killing the opponent. Going 2nd you can use the various removal cards you have to break boards, the kaiju slumbers, all 6 kaijus, alpha (synergises well with kaijus since it can bounce a kaiju the opponent has back to your hand and then you can summon the kaiju back to your opponent’s field by tributing something else and alpha can bring itself back to the field as a rank 8 xyz target), bigfoot and thunderbird (have removal effects when discarded). Then your goal is to get 2 level 8 monsters on to your field and go into Number 97: Dragublion. Then you can use its effect to summon numeron dragon from the extra deck and you can otk using it since it will have 9000 attack after you use it’s effect. It’s attack will be 13000 if you have a rank 4 on the field as well (very likely) and that can hit over any monster the opponent controls with 5000 or less attack (I highly doubt they will have anything with that much attack so it is pretty much a win). If they put their monsters in defense - SLAP A KAIJU ON THEM!! The deck is not dead going 1st either. The plan going 1st is to set up your deity of the abhyss, a dweller and a hope harbinger (best case scenario) or the board can even be as simple as a Bagooska pass. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>I think overall this deck is very solid and is a good rogue tier OTK deck at best. It won’t top any tournaments or anything like that, but it is a fun deck to mess around with and also allows you to take a break from the meta and have some fun!! To me personally it is amazing to have a break from the meta, I post mostly meta decks but building and testing this deck for a change was very enjoyable indeed. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>If you are interested, I do an in depth deck profile and combo tutorial in my youtube channel, I recommend watching it since it can help you understand what I actually said on here and you will get a basic understanding of how the deck is played. </span>

You should be going first and by the time it is your opponent's turn, you will have about 2 to 4 cards ripped out of your opponent's Extra Deck but usually 2. 2 of which would be your choice. A <strong>Deskbot</strong> engine and a<strong> Lefty</strong>/<strong>Righty Driver</strong> engine help turbo out <strong>Dogmatika Albaz Knight</strong> with <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong>.

2 <strong>Dogmatika Albaz Knight</strong> which rips 1 card of your choice from your opponent's ED every turn and is <strong>Punishment</strong> on legs since you can send <strong>N'tss</strong> from yours. 2 <strong>Ashiyan</strong> for recycling. 3<strong> Fleurdelis</strong> for Extra Deck negation. 3<strong> Ecclesia</strong> since she searches a lot of the deck. 1 <strong>Maximus</strong> which can take out 2 card from your opponent's ED and it can also help set up your<strong> Albaz Knight</strong> plays. <strong>Deskbot</strong> and<strong> Lefty</strong>/<strong>Righty Driver</strong> engines. 1 <strong>DMOC</strong> as the target for <strong>Chaos Scepter Blast</strong>. And 3 <strong>Ash</strong>.

3 <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> for searching. 3<strong> Dogmatikas</strong> which is your ritual spell (and basically<strong> Nadir Servant</strong>). 3 <strong>Chaos Scepter Blast</strong> which is nontargeting banishing of any card on the field face-down and it is always live since you will always have a lv8 spellcaster on field. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 1 <strong>Encounter</strong>. 3<strong> Punishment</strong>.

Half the Extra Deck is just things that do stuff in the grave and the other half is to turbo <strong>Albaz Knight</strong>. 2 <strong>Titaniklad</strong> which you can also play 3 of if you don't like <strong>Amblowhale</strong>. 3 <strong>N'tss</strong>. 1 <strong>PSY-Framelord Omega</strong>. 1 <strong>Wind Pegasus @Ignister</strong>. 2<strong> Herald of the Arc Light</strong>. 1 <strong>Abyss Dweller</strong>. 1 <strong>Amblowhale</strong> which is just a pop when a link monster is popped. 1 of the <strong>BLS</strong> link. 1 <strong>Auroradon</strong>. 1<strong> Halq</strong>. 1 of the new <strong>Lyna</strong> link monster.

Side Deck. 1 <strong>Nexus</strong> which is just sort-of removal? 3 <strong>Lancea</strong>. 3 <strong>Belle</strong>. 3 <strong>Dark Ruler</strong>. 1 <strong>Duster</strong>. 1 <strong>Encounter</strong>. 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>."

We'll start by opening 1 Booster Box (24 packs) of the first five packs released during the 5Ds era: from The Duelist Genesis to Ancient Prophecy. I was very fortunate to open a good pool of the Blackwing cards and some versitial Synchro monsters with Red Dragon Archfiend as my deck's current ace. I also pulled some of the Assault mode cards including Red Dragon Archfiend/Assualt Mode so having that in the side could come in handy. For spell and trap removal I'll have to rely on Power Tool Dragon (to search Double Tool or Silver Wing) and Release Restraint. Initialy my strategy was to use Fane the Steel Chain's effect to deal damage through piercing with Bora the Spear or Armed Wing; however, as a level 2 non-tuner, it doesn't fit the roll of synchro material with what I have available: Gishilnodon requires a level 3 non-tuner which means I'll most likely use Blizzard to bring back a Kalut from grave to summon it and without a level 1 Blackwing tuner, I wouldn't be able to use a level 3 and Fane to summon Armed Wing. However, Blizzard + Kalut and Fane can make level 7 synchros or Gale + Kalut and Fane could make Red Dragon Archfiend, but that requires a little more setup. For now, Fane will be in the side deck along with my Assault Mode support, 3 copies of Fake Feather, and 2 copies of Gozen Match. The Arcanite Magician wouldn't be usable but because I have some Assault Mode support I thought I'd include it in the extra deck."

With the other traps we can make Xyz, Synchro and link during the opponent's turn.

Antjaw is a good card, it brings good target from the deck, it can also bring another copy of it, it also has the advantage that its effect is not even once per turn</span>"

That being said, the Legendary Fisherman III is more like a ""bank shot"" and only comes out occasionally, its more often a Tatsunoko or Moray of Greed target when its around too early in the hand.

The build isn't 100% perfect. I'm pretty sure there are some better cards to employ than some of these. If anything, its meant to be a skeleton as you can add and remove cards as you please according to you and also give yourself ideas on how to make a Fisherman Water deck playable.

I am aware there is a better way to play Fisherman with cards such as the Combat Star cards, but meh, often has felt weird to me playing them like that and it not being a true Water deck like intended for the monster and being true to Mako Tsunami. But I also wouldn't mind hearing ideas for Legendary Fisherman and seeing what kind of deck you can build around it whether Water or not.

Main idea is simple enough regarding combos, one combo only requires you needing a Megalo and Deep Sea Diva in hand.

&gt;NS Diva
&gt;Activate Diva effect, SS Neptabyss
&gt;Activate Neptabyss effect, send Dragoon to  GY, add a 2nd Dragoon to hand
&gt;Activate Dragoon effect in GY, add a 2nd Neptabyss to hand
&gt;Activate Megalo, discard Nebtabyss and Dragoon, SS Megalo
&gt;Activate both the 2nd Neptabyss's and 2nd Dragoon's effect, Neptabyss will SS a Dragoon from GY while the Dragoon you discarded with Megalo will add another Megalo to hand or something else if already have a Level 7 in hand.
&gt;Link off Diva and Megalo for Needlefiber
&gt;Activate Needlefiber effect, SS another Diva
&gt;Synchro Summon Tatsunoko with 2nd Diva and Neptabyss
&gt;Synchro Summon Bihamut with Tatsunoko and Level 7 in hand (Probably Megalo if you added him to hand earlier)
&gt;Activate Bihamut effect, SS Token
&gt;Link off Needlefiber, the Token, and Dragoon for a Apollousa (3 negates)
Then opponent's turn, SS another Token with Bihamut."

Deck is constructed towards what is currently working well, with some added spice.

Side Deck is not a real side deck. Just a few card ideas to look towards.

Card count is 44 with room of adjustment and/or ready to play out of the box.

Alpha, the Master of Beasts is not a real choice. Looks prettier than Ash Blossom. [Fight me!]"

When the OCG support releases to the TCG I'll probably make an updated profile. For the strategy, it's just to make Exblowrer and using the Time Thiefs to make rank 4s.

Something not too hard to learn and no long combos to memorize? Well, I've got just what you need....

Paleo frog has been around in various forms for the past four or so years as a rogue strategy that always shows up in bigger tournaments. The deck revolves around traps and interrupting your opponent's lines of play. I feel this is the best way for a new player to learn the game as the more you play against different decks, the more you learn to counteract them. With combo decks you just focus on what you want to do.

This is a budget version of the deck so sadly you only get two copies of toadally awesome. Getting a third copy will be top priority as well as three copies of trap trick. Luckily, you can get those cards for perhaps 5 or 6 dollars more total. As it stands this will certainly hold you for a while at a locals level."

This time around with more control!,Basic strategy is to end on an extra deck lock out and force all your opponents cards on their turn to be banished instead. That just helps you by them losing out on as many plays as possible. With Trap Trick and Different Dimension Ground there are six 1 turn Macro Cosmos and  the one-ofs of both Macro Cosmos and Dimensional Fissure.

This time I plan on FTKing with numeronius numeronia by making it using a RUM and <a data-name=""Outer Entity Nyarla"">Outer Entity Nyarla and skipping to the end phase of my opponent's turn. I have no clue if this is actually how this works but i felt like I'd give it a try</a>
<h2>The meat and potatoes:</h2>
The main board state you are trying to achieve is:

number iC1000

Belial

burning bamboo sword and broken bamboo sword

anti-spell fragrance and thunder of ruler set

To achieve this lofty goal I will be using the same deep-draw engine as my <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/borgar-time-ftk-post-banlist-2021/"">Borgar Time FTK post Dec Banlist</a>

The main combo will be the same as that list's combo, but if you feel to lazy to read the combo guide linked above I will give you the short version:

Make Isolde and summon Armageddon Knight, Knight will dump plagues, you make halq, into power tool, into some D.D.R.s, basically just doing yep warrior combos until you have a board of 2x s'monk, a rescue ferret, an n'tss, and white rose, you then make the mathmech xyz for 4 and search de-synchro, then you make draco masters and use ferret's effect getting cube, magicat, and tuninware. you do some garbage until you draw your entire deck, and then make saryuja. Then for this combo do the following:

skull dread summon belial

summon valk and wyverburster

make nyarla and use it's effect to make it rank 11

make reprodocus

use reprodocus to make nyarla a light

use astral force to go into iC1000

use burning bamboo and equip broken to anything

activate terminal world

set anti-spell and thunder of ruler

pass turn

opponent's end phase you win by iC1000's effect ( I think)(you don't)

instead equip xyz unit to numeronia and Kill them next turn (the other effect can still just be used to mess with them)

You won't deck out if you discard deep-seated for hand size."

edit : i meant fun :^)","hi, it's the worst guy again :D

Today is a vendread deck, without the zombie strat cuz it's not about winning it's about loosing with style. we all know that.

So the strat is simple sending your zombie monster to the GY with the Uni-zombie and the Samurai skull. you can also get rid of cards in your opp hand with Hand destruction while you can send your dead zombie card to the GY. Mezuki cuz we need to summon back either our rituals (once they have already been ritual summoned) or some folder to link on your Vampire sucker or Cross-sheep. We only use the 3 revenant and 3 houndhorde sinc they give the effect to banish monster or Spell/traps which is really good atm. Pre-preparation of rites due to the deck being a ritual based deck, but we can only get Revendread origin and Revendread slayer to our hand, but it's good enought combo to make the deck run quite well. The deck have lots of weaness, can't really play throught 2 handtraps or even 1 with a bad hand, but most of the time it's full combo. with 2 ritual monster on the board+ a link 2, you can even add an I:P masquerena so you can go for an apolousa during your opponent turn.

And.. that's it. not a lot to say it's a TCG exclusive deck with good artwork, good lore and mechanics but lacks a good engine and the endboard is not that sufficient nowadays but it's good enought for casual player, pretty cheap, exept for hand traps but you can easily go for sets of forbidden lances chalice and robe so no worries :)"

I added a little salamangreat for utility, I'm not entirely sure if it'll work

De-synchro is really good at times

Use hyper librarian to get more rekindlings and make big plays

Accesscode to swing for game

Did I forget to mention that lavalval dragun is a really good de-synchro target?

The main flaw is that you can walk yourself into a corner sometimes.

Overall a fun deck, I hope you enjoy it!"

<strong>Pure </strong>Destiny Hero Deck coming soon!

extra deck was a tough one, wanted to add soo much cards xd, 15 was not enough lol, but kept it as it is because everything runs soo smoth and well together xD.

Not that deck is not strong enough already xD, But for even more competitive play Deck can be edited using side deck cards such as ice dragon prison, infinite impermanence, harpie's feather nibiru, kaiju etc. For even more consistency you can add or replace some cardswith E-Emergency call, which i didn't add cause deck is already consistent , and with Isoldel effect i can add any hero card to my hand making E-Emergency call less required."

I play 3 cragger because i play nat beast. while playing the deck, ive had the problem where i have a cragger on field and nothing to do with it, so i use it as a way to (kinda) infinite spell negates.

I just play the pranks for a draw and a level 2. dont play place since i'd rather find rock off of an excavation, but thats probably just me

Revival golem+rupture can be swapped w Gigantes and a called by

doki doki sus

i play apollousa because of the swarming of the deck.

Dragite=Underrated   good removal that gets removed by the opponent which is why i play 2.

This is a fun deck that utilizes all the HERO card types, so about 30-40% time, it kinda bricks. Otherwise, the deck follows the traditional HERO playstyle.

Play Guide

Search out <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a>(via Reinforcements/E-Emergency Call to search out Stratos, which can search any HERO monsters upon being summoned)

Summon Faris, also while dumping a HERO monster(preferably those with graveyard effects, like shadow mist, liquid soldier, etc.) then place a copy of Vision HERO Increase to the field as a continuous trap, release Faris, then summon Vision HERO Vyon, which then allows you to send a HERO monster to the graveyard(perferably shadow mist or Destiny HERO Malicious)(If you dumped shadow mist(provided that Shadow Mist wasn't used before), search Evil HERO Adusted Gold, then search out Dark Calling) then Banish a HERO from the grave to search polymerization, and link the two Vision HEROs for Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer to reveal Flame Wingman(If necessary, Neos Kluger) to search out Bustnatrix and Avian.

Fuse Bustnatrix and Avian for Elemental HERO Sunriser to search out a copy of Miracle fusion

If normal summon is still available, summon a HERO monster from hand to link summon Xtra HERO Wonder Driver, then summon a HERO to the bottom center arrow of Wonder Driver to retrieve an fusion/change spell card, and use Wonder Driver and an available HERO monster to go into Xtra HERO Dread Decimator(for this, preferably use Malicious, or an atm useless fusion monster). And then summon either Flame Wingman, or one of the omni HEROs(Escuridao or Absolute Zero).

Next turn

If Neos Fusion isn't available, go into the 2nd copy of Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer to search out Neos and Yubel to summon Neos Kluger, and attack for game with the HEROs."
