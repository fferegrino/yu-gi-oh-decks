Gift Exchange+Angel O7+Mask of Restrict+Closed Forest,"<p>(Credit to AceTrainerAJ for his support and decktesting. Much appreciated!)</p><p>Some time ago, I made a full zone block deck with&nbsp;<a href=""/deck/372574"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Kashtira Shangri-Ira.</strong></a> So, I decided to make a new version, where Supreme King Dragon is going to copycat Shangri-Ira and Rainbow Neos. Rather than using HFD and Raigeki, where you might not be able to destroy everything, Rainbow Neos can get rid of everything your opponent has by shuffling everything into their deck. Oh btw, everything is done within 300 sec, so you can do what I was going to explain in Ranked as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wUp_BXiAkg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Cthugua is present and Shamisen is in GY, Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Gale with it. Then, activate Gale twice to send Shangri-Ira + Rainbow Neos from Extra Deck to GY, at the cost of 6000 LP in total.</p><p>2) Place both Predaplants on Pendulum Zones and activate Bufolicula to Fusion Summon Supreme King Dragon by using both Predaplants monsters on Pendulum Zones as materials. Next, activate Supreme King Dragon and target Rainbow Neos in GY to copycat its abilities. There, you can set any spell but combo pieces and send it to GY. This allows you to shuffle all of your opponent's Spells and Traps into their Main Deck.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. As long as you don't banish Shamisen by accident, all is well.</p><p>4) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. Copycat Rainbow Neos for another time with Supreme King Dragon. There, you can send Panda to GY and you can be able to shuffle all of your opponent's monsters into Main/Extra Deck.</p><p>5) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. This time, gain abilities of Shangri-Ira with Supreme King Dragon. Then, Special Summon Shamisen with its ability.</p><p>6) Refill your deck with ""Pot of Avarice"", in addition to fetching some cards from BZ with ""Primal Seed"". Then, set Primal Seed + Gift Exchange and Synchro Summon Salamander by using Cthugua + Shamisen as materials.</p><p>7) Activate Salamander, which puts every card you have back into Main Deck. Then, play ""Gift Exchange"" to start blocking your opponent's zones. You should prioritize targeting your combo pieces to fetch them into your hand with ""Primal Seed"" loop. Here are those:</p><ul><li><strong>Angel O1:&nbsp;</strong>It will be used to reveal Angel O7. There, we can use the ability of O1 to Tribute Summon O7 at the end, by using O1 + Gale as tributes.</li><li><strong>Angel O7:&nbsp;</strong>If Tribute Summoned, Effect Monsters can't activate their effects, wherever they are.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies Field Spells.</li></ul><p>8) When all of your opponent's zones are locked with ""Gift Exchange"" and ""Shangri-Ira"" combinations, activate ""Closed Forest"". Set ""Mask of Restrict"" and Tribute Summon Angel O7. Everything was explained in full detail in #7. Then, set ""Primal Seed"" and end your turn. Also, ME-PSY-YA allows Spells and Traps to be sent to BZ instead of GY. You can consider it as another blocker, since there are little to none of Spells/Traps that can activate from BZ.</p><p>9) During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Mask of Restrict"". Since your opponent has nothing to do, they will pass the turn back to you. Then, attack your opponent directly to win the game:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Rainbow Neos"" can be found within ""Crystal Septenary"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Closed Forest"" can be found within ""Forest Friends"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Lavalval Salamander"" can be found within ""Combatants of Flame"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gift Exchange"" + ""Gale Dogra"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Between 60 card pile Rikka/Aroma/Sylvan I feel like this is the best 40 card version I can currently come up with (totally open to suggestions otherwise)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deck is focused on advantage and recursion. Your main focus of the deck is to get into Sylvan Dancepione as quick as you can to get the excavate highroll. Since most monsters in the deck offer advantage or a way to keep pushing the combo forward it kind of doesn't matter what you hit as long as you hit a single plant at the very least.&nbsp;</p><p>Hitting 3 plants off Dancepione is also completely okay and is most often the absolute best high roll, leading to the best ending board you can make from the sheer advantage you can get.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck also centers around heavily abusing non-HOPT effects, primarily being multiple revivals of Sylvan Hermitree and Aromaseraphy Jasmine/Aromage Jasmine.</p><p>The hand fixing this deck can do is absolutely off the charts in my opinion, you should be getting at the very minimum 2 Hermitree draws and 1 Aromaseraphy Jasmine draw for just doing your end board as you would normally taking all other cards out of the equation.</p><p>Sylvan Charity is absolutely the best card in the deck even in 2024 now but suffers from sequencing conflicts. Example: You want to Charity first to fix your hand but once you continue that sequence into making Dancepione; you learn you would have benefitted more from holding Charity and taking the gamble on making Dancepione first. But that is why I call this deck&nbsp;<strong>Highroll.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, you will see 90% of your cards with any given hand with how many 1/2 card starters there are- compiled with the raw advantage from multiple draws (3+) and searches (Humid Winds, Mardel, Sweet Marjoram, Aromalylith Rosemary).</p><p>The most common end board i've managed to land on with this deck with any given hand would look something like:</p><p><strong>Benghalancer </strong>(1 Bounce, LP loss is irrelevant), <strong>Aromalylith Magnolia</strong> (Board Protection fusion+ATK boost), <strong>Aromage Sweet Marjoram</strong> (OPT destroy a card on Life-gain), T<strong>eardrop the Rikka Queen</strong> (Quick effect tribute an opponents monster), and usually at least 2 of the 3<strong> Dried Winds , Humid Winds , Blessed Winds </strong>(Usually you will draw one or two throughout the combo, and search the outlier from Sweet Marjoram if you placed anything other than Humid Winds face up off Aroma Blend)</p><p>Thanks for reading, hope you give it a try. If you're interested in a 60 card build honestly throw in the Rikka core and Sunavalon/Therion stuff and mess around as you see fit but I found it didn't help this specific build as it really skews the RNG from Dancepione with that much variance (though summoning Petal or Mudan from Dancepione is pretty sick)</p>"

Then you use Nunus Gy effect to revive itself before then tribute it using Daybreak giving you 2 tokens and getting it off the board so you don't get reptile locked. Then you use the tokens and Nauya to either make the link 3 if you have fuel to use its search effect or a second copy of the link 2 and going into Sunavalon Dryatrentiay and searching bloom so that you can negate your opponents entire board on their turn and setting up a potential otk for your next turn.</p><p>This is the best build I have found after a few days of testing and I am sure with more testing that better builds will be found that possibly focus on supporting a specific deck to boost the power that Raika already has.</p>

Since Alich destroys itself automatically, you can play D.D.R. as many times as you like.</p><p>4) It's time to send Seed Cannons to GY and deal damage. Since Banisher delivers everything to BZ, we have to close Banisher with ""Book of Moon"". Now, 3 x Seed Cannon can be sent to GY to deal 3 x (500 x 5) = 7500 damage in total.</p><p>5) Since the damage isn't enough, we have to try again. Open Banisher with ""Book of Taiyou"" to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop another time. Here, play ""Soul Release"" to banish 1 x Book of Moon + 3 x Seed Cannon. Then, retrieve combo pieces needed with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #3 + #4 + #5 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Turn 1.5 cards -> 6+ negates and follow-up!,"<div>Historically, Superheavy Samurai has been an obscure rogue archetype possessing interesting unique gimmicks found almost nowhere else - gigantic defense position beatsticks attack while in defense position (applying DEF as ATK), the duelist is rewarded/punished for having no spells and traps in GY, and stealing your opponent's backrow to use as your own. However, with the release of Indomitable Pride, Superheavy Samurai has evolved from a simple beatdown deck into a potent combo machine!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Twelve 1.5 card starters, a link-1 monster reborn and a non-once per turn ""ROTA"" grant this strategy incredible ability to create monstrous 3 to multiple negate boards, while having tons of follow-up for next turn! The extreme consistency of this deck's starters also give Superheavy Samurai ridiculous amounts of space for staple cards - allowing for 15+ handtraps to be maindecked!

Arcana + Oracle + Museum,"<p>Welcome! In this deck, we will slowly but surely kill the opponent thanks to ""Dark Snake Syndrome"" without attacking, which is granted by ""Ghostrick Museum"". Let me explain!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YcUxhhpl8pQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, play ""Time-Tearing Morganite"". Then, while ""Light Barrier"" is active, either Special Summon Arcana with Saryuja or Tribute Summon Arcana thanks to Morganite. Choose the outcome as&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to always skip your opponent's turn at the cost of sending two of your monsters to GY, which is guaranteed of 2 x Cockroach Knight cards later on.</p><p>2) Fusion Summon Oracle by using Swirl + Ghost as materials by activating Swirl. Then, if you have played ""Into the Void"" while holding 2 x Cockroach Knight, activate ""Ghostrick Museum"" and 3 x Dark Snake Syndrome. Finally, end your turn but don't forget to send two of any monsters but Oracle + Arcana to GY.</p><p>3) During the first turn, if you haven't noticed, Cockroach Knights were placed on top of the Main Deck. When your turn begins, you will draw two cards instead of one thanks to Morganite and you are going to draw exactly those Cockroach Knights. Since you are able to Normal Summon or Set twice instead of once, you can place Cockroach Knights on the battlefield. When your turn ends, you can send them to GY with Arcana and skip your opponent's turn. With Cockroach Knights being placed on top of the Main Deck, this step can happen as many times as you want or until the opponent is dead.</p><p>4) During the Standby Phase of yours, Dark Snake Syndromes will deal some damage, which will be doubled during each Standby Phases of yours.

Mind you, you have to Link Summon Saryuja when you have 4 cards in Main Deck to draw them all and shuffle back all three ""Coffin Seller"" cards, which is a setup you need to prepare in advance for ""The Dark Magicians"" (TDM).</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. As long as you don't banish Grace/Parasite by accident, everything will be alright.</p><p>4) Fusion Summon TDM by using Parasite + Spellcaster as materials. Activate TDM three times to draw all three ""Coffin Seller"" Trap cards, which can be activated any time. To reset TDM, don't forget to destroy TDM with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and revive with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>5) If 3 x Coffin Seller are active, revive Grace and Alector + Flamvell with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, Synchro Summon Trident by using Alector + Flamvell as materials.</p><p>6) Start by sending your opponent's monsters from Main/Extra Deck to GY with Grace/Trident. Each time you do it, you deal 300 x 3 = 900 damage in total, thanks to ""Coffin Seller"" cards. Since Grace/Trident aren't hard once per turn, you can reset them with Offerings and revive them with Reborn.</p><p>7) Repeat what was explained in #6 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

D.D. Designator + Drop-Off,"<p>So, have you heard of infamous Yata-Lock? Ever wondered how to relive but don't know where to start from? Well, you are in luck, as ""Treasure Panda"" can make it happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6xxwuE6STg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Baronne is present, Special Summon Banisher with Saryuja. Then, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability. Your Primal Seed loop is ready.</p><p>2) Play D.D. Designator until you deplete your opponent's resources in-hand. Then, set ""Drop Off"" to discard whatever your opponent can draw later on. Had ""Time Seal"" not been banned in Master Duel, you would have used ""Temple &gt;&gt;&gt; Time"" combo to send signals of Yata-Lock but it is what it is.</p><p>3) Play Offerings on Baronne. Then, activate D.D.R. on Baronne. This step is needed to not deck-out besides clearing your opponent's stuff one by one, should you go second.</p><p>4) If you have played ""Into the Void"" and holding ""Yata-Garasu"" in-hand, set ""Primal Seed"" and end your turn. On your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Drop Off"". If needed, negate whatever your opponent can activate with Baronne in response to ""Drop Off"", just in case.</p><p>5) When it's your turn, use ""Primal Seed"" to fetch Yata + Offerings. Then, Normal Summon Yata and attack with it to skip your opponent's Draw Phase. If you also want to skip yours, just destroy Yata with Offerings.</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #6 besides attacking with other monsters to win the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Drop Off"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Once while this Fusion Summoned card is face-up on the field, you can pay LP in multiples of 2000 and choose to activate up to 3 effects based on every 2000 LP you paid. The first effect allows you to add a Spell/Trap from your GY to your hand. The second effect destroys exactly 3 cards your opponent controls. And the third effect has Coordius gain ATK equal to half the different between your LP and your opponent's LP for this turn only, but your other monsters cannot attack this turn. So, one way that you can Summon Coordius really easily is if you use&nbsp;<strong>Deep Sea Diva</strong> to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince</strong> from Deck. Then, you would Synchro the two of them into&nbsp;<strong>Goyo Defender</strong>. Goyo Defender Special Summons 2 more copies of itself from Extra Deck. Xyz 2 of them into a Rank 3 and then Link that Xyz Monster and the remaining Goyo Defender into a Link-2 Monster. Now, if you have&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong>, you can go ahead and banish a Synchro, Xyz, and Link from field/GY to Fusion Summon Coordius. That works, but we are trying to play Prediction Princess here. We need a way to find&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong>, and have a Synchro, Xyz, and Link to Fuse into Coordius. And that is easily done utilizing the power of&nbsp;<strong>Red Resonator</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong>. And, we are also making use of some of the new Goblin Rider monsters from PHNI to get ourselves into the right position to get our materials for Coordius. Same 2.5-card combo:&nbsp;<strong>Red Resonator</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong>, and a monster to send for Scorpio's effect. Normal Red Resonator who Special Summons Scorpio. Scorpio sends a monster from hand to GY to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra&nbsp;</strong>from Deck who searches for&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong>. Xyz Cobra and Scorpio into the new&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Big-Head Gabonga</strong> who adds a Golin monster from Deck to hand on Xyz Summon. Add&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Dug the Assaulter</strong>. Dug detaches a material from Gabonga to Special Summon itself from hand. Synchro Red Resonator and Dug into&nbsp;<strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong> who adds&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> from Deck to hand on Synchro Summon. Link Gabonga and Ib into&nbsp;<strong>Donner, Dagger Fur Hire</strong>. Activate Miracle Synchro Fusion and banish Ib, Gabonga, and Donner from field/GY to Fusion Summon Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon from Extra Deck. Pay 2000 LP with Coordius to add back Miracle Synchro Fusion from GY. Activate Monstrosity targeting Coordius to get&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> from Deck. Xyz Coordius and Deus-X into&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator&nbsp;</strong>in the EMZ who sends <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> from Extra Deck to GY. Herald triggers to add&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> from Deck to hand. Target Herald in GY with Aggregator and detach Deus-X to attach Herald from GY to itself. Link Aggregator into&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>. Herald hits the GY and triggers again to add&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> from Deck to hand. Activate Underworld Ritual to Ritual Summon Tarotrei by Tributing Bibliomuse. Bibliomuse Special Summons herself back from GY face-down. Tarotrei changes Bibliomuse to face-up Attack Position. Bibliomuse's Flip Effect triggers to add&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith&nbsp;</strong>and another Underworld Ritual from Deck to hand. Activate the Underworld Ritual you just searched to Ritual Summon Tarotreith face-down. Proceed to your End Phase and Tarotrei Special Summons Deus-X from GY face-down. During your opponent's Standby Phase, banish Underworld Ritual from GY as Chain Link 1 and activate Tarotrei's effect as Chain Link 2. Tarotrei changes Tarotreith to face-up Attack Position and Underworld Ritual Special Summons another Bibliomuse from Deck face-down. On a new Chain, Tarotreith's Flip Effect triggers to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden&nbsp;</strong>from Deck face-down. Heading into your opponent's Main Phase, you can activate Tarotreith's effect to flip Bibliomuse, Deus-X, and Pot of the Forbidden face-up. Pot looks at your opponent's hand and shuffles a card from it back into the Deck, Deus-X negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field, and Bibliomuse searches for another Tarotrei and Underworld Ritual for next turn. That's a pretty good board you have. Now, let's look at what we can do on our next turn. We have the second Underworld Ritual in GY that we can use to get another Bibliomuse from Deck. We have the Tarotrei and Underworld Ritual in hand that we searched on our opponent's turn. And we have Miracle Synchro Fusion which is live and able to Fusion Summon another Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon from Extra Deck. Let's talk about that. We can banish Gravity Controller, Mereologic Aggregator, and Herald of the Arc Light from field/GY with Miracle Synchro Fusion to make another Coordius which is really good. So what can the second Coordius do? Well, if your opponent has 3 or more cards on their field, you can choose to pop 3 of them with Coordius and we can also add back the World Legacy Monstrosity in our GY which can target Coordius again to get 2 Level 9's from our Deck to go into&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> who Tributes itself to get&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> from our Extra Deck and suck up 2 to 3 cards from our opponnent's field depending on if we also Xyz using Coordius. We are never using that 3rd effect because the restriction on your other monsters not attacking is pretty bad if Coordius himself is not game. This is extremely good. I never would've thought that Coordius would be summonable in Prediction Princess and I never figured that it would be this good at setting up your board and setting up an incredible amount of follow-up for your following turn. If anything, I think that this replaces Ib Ham Prediction Princess. It functionally is Ib Ham Prediction Princess, but it has focus on making Coordius which just enables so much more than what Ib Ham Prediction Princess can do. This is functionally one of the best Prediction Princess builds that I have come across and experimented on and it is now my favorite build of Prediction Princess.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck Monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down during your End Phase. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's effect in the End Phase. Her Flip Effect Special Summons a Flip Monster from your Deck face-downn and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back face-down after being Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s card effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawle</strong>r which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute. 1 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden </strong>which has a Flip Effect that lets you choose between Drawing 2 cards, returning all Spell/Traps on the field to the hand, destroying all monsters your opponent controls, or looking at your opponent's hand and shuffling a card from it back into the Deck. 1 <strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light </strong>which is a Level 9 target for Monstrosity in Deck and you can also easily get it onto the field with Lonefire Blossom and on Summon it either searches a Generaider card or a Plant monster. 3&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong> which sends a monster from your hand to the GY on Normal or Special Summon to Special Summon a Predaplant monster from your Deck other than itself. 1&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</strong> which adds a Fusion or Polymerization Spell Card from Deck to hand if it is Special Summoned by the effect of a Predaplant Monster once per Duel. 2&nbsp;<strong>Lonefire Blossom</strong> which Tributes a Plant monster to Special Summon a Plant monster from Deck. 1&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Dug the Assaulter</strong> which is a Level 3 monster we can Special Summon from hand by detaching an Xyz material from a monster on field. We aren't playing any Goblin Rider Spell/Traps, so it is not like we can make use of its other effect. But we just need it for the Summonable Level 3 body. It is not a hard brick since it can Summon itself from your hand, but you'd just prefer not to draw it. 3&nbsp;<strong>Red Resonator&nbsp;</strong>which Special Summons a Level 4 or lower monster from hand on Normal Summon and targets a face-up monster on field on Special Summon to gain Life Points equal to that monster's ATK. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Resonator Call</strong> which adds a Resonator monster from Deck to hand. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which either Special Summons&nbsp; Level 9 monster from your hand or targets a Level 9 monster you control to Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from your Deck with different Types and Attributes than that monster but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession</strong> which Special Summons a monster from GY to Linkpoint. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong> which Fusion Summons a Fusion Monster that lits a Synchro Monster as material by banishing monsters from field and/or GY. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or fac-edown and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from Deck face-down. Finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Trishula, the Dragon of Icy Imprisonment</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham&nbsp;</strong>which Special Summons a Flip Monster from hand or Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 1 <strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong> which adds a World Legacy card from Deck to hand on Synchro Summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light&nbsp;</strong>which adds a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck to hand if sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Merelogic Aggregator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Big-Head Gabonga</strong> which is a Rank 3 Xyz that searches a Goblin monster from Deck on Xyz Summon. That's all that we are using it for, but it can attach a face-up monster on field to itself if a material(s) is detached from a monster(s) on field which can be used as removal perhaps. 1&nbsp;<strong>Donner, Dagger Fur Hire&nbsp;</strong>which is a Link-2 that needs 2 monsters with different Types and can target a Fur Hire you control and a mosnter your opponent controls to destroy them.

Being able to synchro into nearly every level due to how the Earthbound and Runick engine interacts (basicaly everything from 3-12 is possible)<br />2. The Deck has a great grindgame and rewards good deckbuilding and plays due to how Synchrofusion and the Runick extra Deck Monsters work<br />3. The Deck offers a great grindgame<br />4. The Earthbound and Runick Cores are quite small, leaving us with 9 Flex Spots for Handtraps, extenders, Powerspells etc.<br />5. Due to Groundskeeper, Hugin and Slumber our Fireking Matchup is quite good<br />6. Great Fusion/Synchro acces&nbsp;<br /><br />What are the dissadvantages of this Deck?<br />1. In the current Format a lot of the Handtraps like Droll etc. can kill our Deck very easily. Depending on our Hand, even Nibiru can become a huge Problem<br />2. Our Monsters are light/dark which enables opponents Bystials<br />3. If our Groundkeeper gets negated or we are Drolled when activating sweeper, our Endboard quickly turns into Runick+Handtraps<br />4. The extra Deck can get quiet expensive with cards like Chaosangel, Sleipnir etc.<br />The most basic combo this Deck has is: Stone Sweeper/Groundskeeper+1 Runick Spell<br /><br /><br />Given the power that this first turn offers, I believe that the Deck has a lot of potential and if you have read up until here you are probably at least interested in how this Deck works. For this reason you see a Combo Guide for the most basic combo of this Deck down below<br /><br />Discard Sweeper to add Groundskeeper-&gt; Summon Groundskeeper and use his effect to summon Linewalker out of the Deck-&gt; Linewalkers effect triggers to add Harmonic Synchrofusion to your hand-&gt; Use your Runick Spell to Summon Hugin-&gt; activate Harmonic Synchrofusion sending Linewalker and Hugin to summon Dragostapelia and Denglong-&gt; Denglong effect to add 1 Nine Pillars of the Yang Zing to hand<br />-If you have another runick spell or drew into it via Fountain you can also summon Sleipnir and go for a synchro 10 play for either Chengying, Chaosangel or Baronne de Fleur by using Sleipnir+Groundskeeper<br />Endboard: Denglong+Nine Pillars, Dragostapelia, Synchro 10 and 2 cards in Hand<br /><br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this deckbreakdown and if you did I would be happy to hear your suggestions, especially for the extra Deck slots :)</p>"

An entire army of monsters, or a single girl in a mech suit?<br /><br />My money is on Raye (and her friends Roze, Little Knight, TY-Phon and Zeus), since she is more powerful than ever with not one, BUT TWO COPIES OF ENGAGE, ONE OF THE MOST BUSTED CARD IN YUGIOH!</p><p>New cards in the Striker arsenal include Triple Tactics Thrust, which is essentially another copy of Engage or any other blind second boardbreaker you have. This incredible spell card is almost always live, since opponents generally play on your turn with their own deck's monster effects (for example, Fire Kings).Thrust is kind of more affordable now with the recent reprint as well!</p><p>The Extra deck notably has TY-Phon, since you can turn a stolen monster (of course in addition to your MANY ways of taking a monster, you can now steal with triple Mind Control) into a beefy beatstick floodgate! Your enemy's XYZ monster and the ever common TY-Phon can be stolen and turn into Zeus in main phase 2 as well! Little Knight and Azalea offer additional removal on the field.</p><p>A cool interaction with Linkage is that it can turn your Little Knight, TY-Phon or Zeus into a Sky Striker Ace and you can go back to your Striker gameplan!</p><p>The philosophy with Blind Second Sky Strikers is to wipe out most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's unparalleled grind game.</p><p>This deck has cards specifically picked out for the January 2024 meta, like Triple Tactics Talents/Thrust (super good since duelists often monster effects during your turn or handtraps you) and 9 monster stealing cards (particularly good at cracking Fire King boards).<br /><br />The current meta allows for Evenly Matched and Raigeki to obliterate most duelist's boards this format since they spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to 1-2 cards - allowing your Sky Striker gameplan to go off unhindered and out-resource your opponent.<br /><br />When your opponent forces you to go 1st thinking all you do is spam ""Raigeki"" and ""Evenly Matched,"" metagame them by siding in all your handtraps in the sidedeck, as well as your searchable normal trap floodgates like Dimensional Barrier and Different Dimensional Ground!<br /><br />If your weakened opponent hasn't surrendered yet due to the sheer resource advantage and offensive pressure this deck generates, you can clear the board with a plethora of cards including Linkage, allowing Raye to OTK all by herself!<br /><br />If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!</p><p>GLHF Duelists!</p><p><strong><em><a>Want to see the deck in action?

In the future I might run a third normal welcome labrynth because that is the ideal card you want to have in your hand with Ariane. Might also change lava golem to 3 Balls and remove the bystial cards for 3 crows if fire king is too annoying. I changed out full force virus in the extra for labrynth set-up because I have never run into a scenario where I want to run that card.

This is the only issue you need to be concerned of.)</p><p>Have you ever wondered how to mill your opponent with Maxx ""C"" on the very first turn itself? Although not a guaranteed FTK, if your opponent is happy-go-lucky, consider yourself really lucky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Cu2y6gboSk"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Check these options before/during the game and change them as shown, which matters later on:</p><ul><li>Self-Chain &gt;&gt;&gt; On</li><li>Card Position &gt;&gt;&gt; Manual</li><li>Activation Order Settings &gt;&gt;&gt; On</li></ul><p>2) At one point, play these cards or combos at any time but End Phase...</p><ul><li>Activate ""Gift Exchange"" and choose Maxx ""C"" as the target. I hope your opponent activates it, which is all that matters.</li><li>Activate ""Temple &gt;&gt;&gt; Rebirth"" combo and choose <strong>Types&nbsp;</strong>of monsters in GYs as <strong>Zombie</strong>, which synergizes well with Hela. Then, destroy Temple + Rebirth with ""Twin Twisters"" by discarding Samsara. If you can't discard Samsara with ""Twin Twisters"", you can also do that with Dugares.</li><li>Activate ""Double Summon"", which will be used for Wanghu. When Ravenous is present, Special Summon Hela with Saryuja and Normal Summon Wanghu. Then, pass Wanghu to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"" but if your oppponent's side is full, feel free to play ""Raigeki"" and clear their side.</li></ul><p>3) There is nothing else to do right now.

To your opponent's knowledge, Wanghu can destroy Samsara but Maxx ""C"" can also draw a card, if this interaction happens. Pray your opponent takes the bait and if they do, proceed with next step. Otherwise, repeat Special Summoning Samsara until your opponent activates Maxx ""C"".</li><li>After the activation of Maxx ""C"", chain into Ravenous and discard Wattfox + Any and target anything but Hela/Wanghu. Then, make a follow-up with Hela by tributing Hela and targeting Wattfox in GY to Special Summon it. Even though Wattfox isn't Zombie by default, ""Rebirth Judgment"" changed the outcome in that regard, so that Hela can be able to pick Wattfox.</li><li>With Chain Link 4 ended, everything has been done in order. So, Wanghu will destroy Samsara and Wattfox. Samsara isn't important but Wanghu destroying Wattfox is a huge deal. Your opponent can't be able to activate anything to stop this Mill combo now.</li><li>Since your opponent can't activate anything, that includes Wanghu destroying Samsara. Kindly return Wanghu to where it belongs by pressing the button of ""Shien's Spy"".</li><li>Finally, you can Special Summon Samsara and Wanghu can destroy it. Meanwhile, your opponent draws one by one. Repeat this process until your opponent is completely deck-out to seal your victory.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Rebirth Judgment"" can be collected by purchasing ""Cybernetic Successor"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Raigeki"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom"" can be found within ""Worthy Adversaries"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be found within ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Twin Twisters"" can be found within ""Sisters of the Light"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Morphing Jar #2,"<p>(<strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>There is a chance you can hit ""Morphing Jar #2"" instead of ""Jackpot 7"". If it happens, you lose.)</p><p>Greetings! In this deck, we are trying to hit the jackpot with ""Morphing Jar #2"". Although not guaranteed to win, it's worth giving a shot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When you have 4 cards in your Main Deck, Link Summon Saryuja and activate it. There, you draw all remaining cards and shuffle back three, which has to be ""Jackpot 7"".</p><p>2) Destroy everything with ""Dark Hole"" because you don't want to shuffle any Main Deck monsters with ""Morphing Jar #2"". When you have ""Morphing Jar #2"" in your hand and if you have played ""Into the Void"" beforehand, set All-Out Attacks + 2 x Reverse Reuse + Offerings to the Doomed and end your turn. Also, set the button at the lower right corner of the screen to ""ON"" and don't miss anything happening.</p><p>3) During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate first ""Reverse Reuse"" and target ""Morphing Jar #2"" to Special Summon it to opposing side as face-down. Then, follow-up with ""All-Out Attacks"" to make ""Morphing Jar #2"" face-up. If you are lucky, ""Morphing Jar #2"" mills all three ""Jackpot 7"" cards. Since it has been considered as effect done by your opponent, even if you originally own ""Morphing Jar #2"", you win the duel anyways...</p><ul><li>However, as mentioned previously, it all comes down to whether you are lucky or not. If you couldn't hit all three ""Jackpot 7"" cards, you can give another and final attempt. When ""Morphing Jar #2"" is at your side as face-up, chain into ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and destroy ""Morphing Jar #2"". Reason is that milling effect coming from ""Morphing Jar #2"" has to be done by your opponent, not you.

Voltelluric is a Level 9 EARTH Thunder Flip Monster that has a Flip Effect that allos you to target a set monster your opponent controls and take control of it until your next End Phase. And, it shares the Subeterror Behemoth monster effect of being able to Special Summon itself from hand in Defense Position when a face-up monster you control is flipped face-down and you control no face-up monsters after that. And its last effect is a soft once per turn effect that allows you to change it to face-down Defense Position. I haven't played Subterror before, neither Guru Control nor the Subterror Behemoth version. I am not too sure about how to play Subterror alone as a Deck, but I am pretty sure that Voltelluric is definitely one of the Behemoths that you at the very most play just the 1-of in the Behemoth version. I don't really see it as being that good of a card, nor are we actually going to be using its Flip Effect in this Subterror Prediction Princess Deck. From what I can see, the Subterror monsters mainly just work for their own archetype. They are not like the Shaddolls or the Krawlers who have Flip Effects that are more general in what they do. The Subterror Flip Effects more-so help their own gameplan, but some actually have some pretty generically good effects that we can make use of. </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Subterror Behemoth Umastryx</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> has a Flip Effect that allows you to target a monster your opponent controls and banish it. </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Subterror Behemoth Ultramafus</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> has a Flip Effect that allows you to change all other face-up monsters on the field to face-down Defense Position.

Ritual Summon by Tributing Bibliomuse for full Prediction Princess combo and use Tarotrei to Special Summon back Voltelluric from GY during the End Phase who will be flipped face-up by Tarotreith next turn to turn on Fiendess for a negate. With what we are working with, this version of Subterror Prediction Princess definitely isn't too bad. To a degree, we are making use of Voltelluric and having access to an omni negate with Fiendess is also really nice. This isn't the greatest Prediction Princess list that I have worked with, but it definitely is pretty unique in what it can do (I haven't explained Guru yet). The main issue here is that we can't search for Monstrosity and we cannot always access Bibliomuse as that requires we have Monstrosity. Definitely not bad, but definitely not the best. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotrei</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotreith</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, and 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during your End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down.

Her Flip Effect Special Summons a Flip Monster from your Deck face-down and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from the GY face-down if she is Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Deus-X Krawler</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Kaku is a Level 9 target for Monstrosity to Summon from Deck if we target Voltelluric and it is an easily Summonable Level 9 in general. Mardel is another Level 9 in the Deck to Summon off of Monstrosity if we are targeting Voltelluric and we can also get it off of Lonefire Blossom also. On Summon it adds a Generaider card or a Plant monster from Deck to hand. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Subterror Guru</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. This card is actually not bad. If I wasn't focusing on utilizing Voltelluric, I&rsquo;d be just playing Guru, Fiendess, Subterror Final Battles, and Hidden City as the only Subterror cards in the Deck because they alone are just that good. If I were to describe an actually good version of Subterror Prediction Princess, it&rsquo;d just be Guru Control with Prediction Princess and without any floodgates (other than Deus-X maybe). Guru&rsquo;s Flip Effect adds a Subterror card from Deck to hand other than itself. And while it is face-up on the field, it can target another face-up monster on the field and change both itself and that monster to face-down Defense Position. This effect is a Quick Effect if you control another Subterror card. If anything, we are just playing the 1 copy of Guru as a possible Flip Monster to Special Summon from Deck, or hand if we searched for it off of the activation of Hidden City instead of Fiendess. If we could fit more monsters on our side of the field I&rsquo;d definitely play 2 copies to have a better chance of getting to this card or for having more incentive to actually Summon it. You could Special Summon Guru from Deck off of Tarotreith instead of Deus-X which gives you the ability to use both of its effects for interruption. On Flip, you add Fiendess for an omni-negate and since you control another Subterror in Voltelluric, you can Quick Effect book an opponent&rsquo;s monster as well. But I feel like Deus-X is just better in what it can do, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean Guru is particularly bad or anything. If anything, it is really good and very interesting, but an omni and a book don&rsquo;t compare to negating all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field. 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Subterror Fiendess</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. When your opponent activates a card or effect you can Quick Effect send it from hand or field to GY to target a Subterror monster you control and negate the activation, changing the targeted Subterror to face-down Defense. And you can target a face-up monster you control to change it to face-down Defense Position to Special Summon a Subterror monster from hand or GY in face-up or face-down Defense Position. I guess that this is another way to get Voltelluric onto the field, but at the same time, it proves to have the same issues with if we were to try to get Voltelluric onto the field, if not even more issues. You can&rsquo;t get Bibliomuse from Deck if you target Voltelluric with Monstrosity, you have to actually draw Fiendess and Voltelluric or find a way to get Voltelluric from Deck into the GY, and you actually have to hard-draw Monstrosity. I would much rather be using Fiendess for the omni-negate than using it for its other effect. Perhaps it can come up in situations revolving around you Special Summoning Guru and getting an additional copy of Fiendess for your following turn, but I don&rsquo;t see it being used too often in this Deck. 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, and 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Lonefire Blossom</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

And the fact that Scorpio and Cobra accomplish that while also giving you 2 additional bodies on field is just so incredible that it has resulted in me including them in a lot of versions of Prediction Princess. Scorpio sends a monster from hand to GY on Normal or Special Summon to Special Summon a Predaplant monster from Deck except for itself. Cobra searches for a Fusion or Polymerization Spell Card upon being Special Summoned by the effect of a Predaplant monster once per Duel. And Lonefire Blossom tributes a Plant monster as a soft once per turn to Special Summon a Plant monster from Deck. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal;

Overmind Archfiend is the Level 9 monster that we are looking at today.

As a soft once per turn, it can banish a Psychic monster from your GY. And when it leaves the field, it Summons as many of the monsters that were banished by its effect.

In fact, if you have an Overmind Archfiend on field and a properly summoned Overmind Archfiend in GY, you can have the one on field banish the one in GY which will then Summon it back after it leaves the field and since it is a soft once per turn on its effect, you can keep looping the 2 Overmind Archfiends over and over. In a world where I would be able to consistently Synchro Summon 2 Overmind Archfiends turn 1, I would definitely be doing this.

Normal Summon Diva, Special Summon Gurnards from Deck, Synchro in to Ib, and Ib searches for Monstrosity. Activate the True Draco Continuous Spell and use its immediate Normal Summon to Tribute the Continuous Spell to Tribute Summon Dreiath. Link Dreiath and Ib into some Link Monster, trigger Dreiath to Special Summon Metaltron XII from Deck, and activate Monstrosity targeting Metaltron XII for full Prediction Princess combo. Can you just hard Summon Metaltron XII? Yes, you really can. All it requires is a True Draco Continuous Spell and 3-material worth of Tribute for Metaltron XII and Monstrosity. So, that usually translates to Diva, 2 True Draco Continuous Spells, and Metaltron XII, but you really do have to play around with your hand to see where you are able to go. The combo I described is just a suggestion. Unlike some of my other Prediction Princess Decks, you can&rsquo;t really just draw combo.

Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. 2 </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Deus-X Krawler</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 2 <strong>Metaltron XII, the True Dracombatant</strong>. You could play the 1 copy, but Dreiath only Summons from Deck and hard drawing it isn't too bad either. 3 <strong>Dreiath III, the True Dracocavalry General</strong>. It can also be Tribute Summoned using Continuous Spell/Traps you control. It prevents your opponent frmo targeting face-up True Draco and True King monsters on the field with card effects and they also cannot be destroyed by their card effects either. And if it is Tribute Summoned and leaves the field, you an Special Summon a True King or True Draco monster from Deck in Defense. 1 <strong>Guitar Gurnards Duonigis</strong>. On Special Summon, it banishes cards from the top of your opponent's Deck equal to the number of WATER monsters you control. Can't really see this doing much unless you banish a card your opponent wants to keep in Deck and it is not like we are playing <strong>Deep Sea Prima Donna</strong> either to really make use of the banishes. Just don't activate this against Kashtira. Also, you can target a Level 4 or lower WATER monster you control and increase its Level by its orignal Level which really helps out with getting you to a variety of Synchro plays. 3 <strong>Deep Sea Diva</strong> which Special Summons a Level 3 or lower Sea Serpent monster from Deck on Normal Summon. </span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Spell/Traps: 1 <strong>Terraforming</strong>. 1 <strong>Dragonic Diagram</strong> which can pop another card you control or in your hand to search for a True Draco or True King card from Deck. 3 <strong>True Draco Heritage</strong> which allows you to draw cards equal to the number of True King and True Draco card types that were sent from field to GY this turn. It doesn't do much if you activated or are going to activate Pot of Prosperity, but the most important part of this card is the immediate Normal Summon of a True King or True Draco monster which is considered as an additional Normal Summon. And if it is sent from the Spell/Trap Zone to Gy you can target and destroy a Spell/Trap on field. 3 <strong>Disciples of the True Dracophoenix</strong>. It can target 3 True Draco and/or True King cards in GY and shuffle them into the Deck to draw a card. It has the same immediate Normal Summon effect as Heritage.

The first time my opponent hard opened&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Curse</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle</strong>, <strong>Icejade Kosmochlor</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Maxx ""C""</strong> like a literal divine cringe incarnate and the second time I was matched against the Deck, they literally bricked and imploded in on themselves. I don't particularly hate Icejade, but I just hate their playstyle. Their artwork is so cool and it all just devolves into stun. Icejade has 1 Level 9 monster and that is&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Creation Kingfisher</strong>. Kingfisher is a Level 9 WATER Aqua monster. It can target a WATER monster you control and equip itself from hand or field to it and if it is equipped to an Icejade monster, that monster can attack while in Defense Position, applying its DEF for damage calculation like a Superheavy Samurai does. Also while it is equipped, you can target a monster your opponent controls with ATK less then or equal to the equipped monster's DEF in order to Special Summon this card and return the targeted monster to hand. When I am doing these Level 9 experimentations with Prediction Princess, I really like it when the Level 9 monster that I am trying to work with has its own effect to Special Summon itself. Sometimes that effect isn't usable due to you not being able to set up the right conditions in order to fulfill the requirements necessary to Special Summon that card by its own effect. But luckily, we are actually able to fulfill the requirements for Kingfisher to Special Summon itself. We are going to be using our old friend&nbsp;<strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong> in order to be going through a combo that sends&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy - ""World Armor""</strong> from our Deck to the GY, make some Tokens on both fields, Link into&nbsp;<strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong>, set&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession&nbsp;</strong>from Deck, bring back World Armor, and search for&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> while setting up the requirements for Kingfisher to be Summoned in 2 different ways with Monstrosity access. We just need&nbsp;<strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong> and <strong>Icejade Creation&nbsp;</strong><strong>Kingfisher</strong> in hand or a way to add it from Deck or Special Summon it from Deck. You'd be adding it from Deck via&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Cradle</strong> and you will be able to Special Summon it from Deck with&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Manifestation</strong>. Normal Girsu and use its effect to send World Armor from Deck to GY. Activate Girsu's other effect since it is the only monster you control to Special Summon a&nbsp;World Legacy Token to both players' fields. Link Girsu and your Token into Lib the World Key Blademaster which we are able to do since World Armor is our World Legacy card in GY. Ib then sets&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession</strong> from Deck and we are able to activate it since World Armor is in GY. Succession Special Summons back World Armor to Lib's Linkpoint. World Armor searches Monstrosity from Deck on Summon. Now, let's say that you drew Kingfisher or Cradle to search Kingfisher. Link Lib and World Armor into&nbsp;<strong>Ib the World Chalice Priestess</strong>. DO NOT activate Lib's GY effect. Now, equip Kingfisher from hand to Ib. Now activate Kingfisher's effect&nbsp; while equipped to Special Summon itself and bounce your opponent's Token. Ib is a Link Monster with no DEF, so it is still possible to bounce a 0 DEF Token with Kingfisher. Activate Monstrosity targeting Kingfisher for Bibliomuse and Deus-X from Deck and you have full Prediction Princess combo. Now, if you have Manifestation, after you make Ib, activate Manifestaation. Manifestation Special Summons Kingfisher from Deck and you can now target it with Monstrosity and you know the rest.&nbsp;I will say that Icejade Prediction Princess is among one of the better Prediction Princess Decks that I have made. If I had anything to really dislike about this Deck, it would be having to use Girsu. It isn't as accessible as Red Resonator and the Predaplants, but we have to play Girsu to set up Kingfisher/Manifestation while also searching for Monstrosity. To circumvent the potential of not drawing Girsu, I am choosing to play <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual</strong>, but that is taking up our Deckslots to play nonengine cards. I mean, since&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Mermaid</strong> is banned, this is the Deck that makes the best out of the whole Girsu into Lib line. And considering that we are playing <strong>Icejade Ran Aegirine</strong>, we can have some interesting plays.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">.For the Main Deck monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Traotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during your End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei&rsquo;s End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect Special Summons a Flip Monster from your Deck face-down and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from the GY face-down if she is Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler </strong>which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 2&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Creation Kingfisher</strong>. You could play 3, but unless you also draw Ran Aegirine, you can't really make use of the extra Kingfisher in hand if you draw multiple. 3&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Ran Aegirine&nbsp;</strong>which can discard another Icejade or WATER monster to Summon itself and an Icejade Token (Aqua/WATER/Level 3/ATK 0/DEF 0) and while that Token is in the Monster Zone, you can't Summon from the Extra Deck except WATER monsters. Ran Aegirine is a Level 7 Tuner and with the Token being Level 3, you can access the Level 10 WATER Synchro pool which just consists of <strong>Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Gymir Aegirine</strong>, and the new&nbsp;<strong>Lancea, Dragonic Ancestor of the Ice Spirit Mountain</strong>. Chengying is hard to out and it banishes a card from your opponent's field and GY when a card(s) is banished. Gymir Aegirine makes your face-up monsters unable to be destroyed or banished by your opponent's card effects and if you activated that in response to your opponent's card or effect, and your opponent has a card(s) with that name in their field or GY, you can banish those cards. And it can bring itself back from GY if a card(s) is banished by your opponent's card effect. Lancea can twice per turn, once per Chain, Special Summon an Ice Barrier monster from hand, Deck, Extra Deck, or GY if your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) and it can also float into an Ice Barrier Synchro, treating it as a Synchro Summon. Chengying is the best monster to Summon using Ran Aegirine since it is just a large, hard-to-out dude, who can also banish cards from field and GY. As for Gymir Aegirine and Lancea, they both have their downsides in this Deck. Gymir Aegirine isn't too useful in this Deck when we already have Bibliomuse protecting our Ritual Monsters which is enough for the most part. It's not like it gives your field targeting protection. Its protection is sort of limited in a sense as it can't protect you against Dark Ruler or Evenly which are the cards you are the most worried about facing in Prediction Princess. I feel like I we were to play a monster that gives protection or at least protects you from those threats, you could play something that covers those bases better or just play&nbsp;<strong>Whirlwind Weasel&nbsp;</strong>and shotgun its Flip Effect. I'm not saying you can't play it, but it doesn't help protect you against the things you are most worried about in this Deck. As for Lancea, it would be really good if we actually had field space for it. Like it can litereally Summon 2 floodgate Ice Barrier monsters with its effect and float into 3 banishes in <strong>Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier</strong>. We just do not have space on our field for what it can get us. 1&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Tremora</strong> which can send itself from hand to Gy to Special Summon a WATER monster from hand and if a face-up WATER monster(s) you control is destroyed by batlte or card effect while it is in GY, you can banish it to Special Summon and Icejade from hand or GY except for Tremora. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy - ""World Armor""</strong> which searches a World Legacy card from Deck on Normal or Special Summon. And 3&nbsp;<strong>Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight</strong> which sends an Orcust or World Legacy card from Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon and if you control no other monsters, you can Special Summon a World Legacy Token to both players' field.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Manifestation</strong> which if you control a WATER monster and your opponent has a monster on their field or in their GY, you can take an Icejade monster from Deck and either send it to GY or Special Summon it. And if a face-up Icejade monster you contorl leaves the field by your opponent's card effect except through being destroyed while Manifestation is in GY, you can banish this card to target a card your opponent controls and banish it. 3&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Cradle</strong> which adds an Icejade monster from Deck to hand with a different name from the cards you control and in your GY. This card is not one per turn, so you can just keep searching Icejades you don't already have on field or in GY like Ran Aegirine for an additional piece of your endboard. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 2 <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which either Special Summons a Level 9 monster from hand or targets a Level 9 monster you control to Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from Deck with a different Type and Attribute than it but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession</strong> which Special Summons a monster from GY to Linkpoint. 3 <strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 2 <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> which specifically Ritual Summons Prediction Princess Tarotrei and you can banish it from GY except during the turn it was sent there in order to search for a Prediction Princess monster. 3 <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>. And finally, 1&nbsp;<strong>Called By the Grave</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> who can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign&nbsp; - Chengying</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Icejade Gymir Aegirine</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> which searches a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck if sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Ib the World Chalice Priestess</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Lib the World Key Blademaster</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Side Deck: 3&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Evenly Matched</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Coltwing+Queen+Aerosol+Exchange,"<p>So, about a month ago, I've done a burning OTK with Fog Counters featuring <strong><a href=""/deck/updrafting-clouds-409916"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Updraft.</a>&nbsp;</strong>Yet, did you know you can also mill your opponent? Well, let's find out!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/SalIeK2FIYM"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Discard Coltwing + Banisher with Ravenous and don't forget to hold Smoke Ball when it's time to combo. Meanwhile, play ""Gift Exchange"" and target on ""Diamond-Dust Cyclone"".</p><p>2) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Black Luster Soldier (BLS) with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Also, clear everything but BLS with ""Offerings to the Doomed"".</p><p>3) Revive Coltwing with ""Monster Reborn"" and replace it with a token by playing ""Vertical Landing"". By reviving Coltwing another time with ""Monster Reborn"", it should generate two more tokens.</p><p>4) The current level of Coltwing is based on the sum of level of tokens and original level of Coltwing. This is addition, which is actually done only by tokens, not setting its level to fixed amount. Therefore, by playing ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" on Coltwing, its level will increase with respect to level of tokens. Reason is that you will also increase the level of tokens. Here is the process:</p><ul><li>At first, the level of Coltwing will be level 13 &gt;&gt;&gt; Coltwing (4) + Token (3) + Token (3) + Token (3)</li><li>Galaxy Queen's Light &gt;&gt;&gt; Target Coltwing (level 13) &gt;&gt;&gt; Tokens will be level 13</li><li>New calculation = Token (13) + Token (13) + Token (13) + Coltwing (4) = Coltwing (43)</li></ul><p>5) Repeat the step explained in #4, by targeting only on Coltwing and nothing else.</p><p>6) When you think it's enough or you couldn't play ""Galaxy Queen's Light"" due to limits, make enough space with Offerings and BLS to revive Ancient + Level 1 Non-Tuner + Level 1 Tuner with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, Synchro Summon Trishula with those three and start depleting your opponent's resources (Hand+Field+Graveyard) by banishing them. Repeat with ""De-Synchro"" until there is nothing left, especially in-hand.</p><p>7) After reviving a Level 1 Tuner with ""Monster Reborn"", Synchro Summon Baronne by using Trishula + Level 1 Tuner as materials. Next, revive Banisher with ""Monster Reborn"" and destroy ME-PSY-YA with Baronne. With Banisher around, everything will be sent to BZ, which is vital because you don't want your opponent to activate anything from GY.</p><p>8) Play ""Cloudian Aerosol"" by discarding Smoke Ball in-hand and targeting on BLS to let him carry tons of counters. Then, set Primal Seed + Drop Off and end your turn. Don't forget to change the button at the lower right corner of the screen into ""ON"" and you won't miss anything.</p><p>9) After giving your opponent ""Diamond-Dust Cyclone"" with ""Gift Exchange"" and activating ""Drop Off"" during your opponent's Draw Phase, your opponent will only have Cyclone. If your opponent activates the drawn card in response to ""Drop Off"", feel free to negate it with Baronne. Otherwise, you have two options to win...</p><ul><li>Your opponent can activate Cyclone and end the misery by drawing lots of cards. BLS had lots of counters. For each 4 counters, your opponent draws a card, which is enough to deck-out, even with 60 cards deck.</li><li>Your opponent is stubborn to not activate.

Next, Synchro Summon Rockks by using Cthugua + Shamisen as materials and destroy Rockks with Ravenous to place Rockks on Pendulum Zone. Then, feel free to Synchro Summon Barrone with Ravenous + Level 1 Tuner as materials, if you wish.</p><p>3) Link Summon Saryuja but make sure you free up Main Monster Zones (MMZ) Saryuja points to your side. Place Guitariss on other Pendulum Zone and Pendulum Summon monsters, three of which have to be Hela + 2 x Trickstars placed on where Saryuja points to. Place Hela to the left and Trickstars to the center and right. Then, fill the rest via Pendulum Summon with any monsters but Samsara/Wattfox/Wanghu.</p><p>4) Link Summon Catbat by using 2 x Trickstars as materials and place Catbat to the center of Saryuja. Then, Special Summon Wanghu with Saryuja. If opposing side is full, clear with ""Raigeki"". Otherwise, pass Wanghu to your opponent with ""Shien's Spy"".</p><p>5) Play ""Temple &gt;&gt;&gt; Rebirth"" combo and choose <strong>Types&nbsp;</strong>of monsters in GYs as&nbsp;<strong>Zombie</strong>, which synergizes well with Hela. Then, destroy all of your Spell/Trap cards with ""Gryphon's Feather Duster"", which is a must for Samsara to be always active during End Phase of yours...</p><ul><li>Alternatively, you can also use ""Twin Twisters"", seen in ""Side Deck"". First, you can activate Pendulum Zone ability of Guitariss to return Guitariss + Rockks to your hand. Then, play ""Twin Twisters"" to destroy Temple + Rebirth. There, you don't control any Spell/Trap cards. This setup only matters if you don't want to reveal Samsara by discarding with ""Into the Void"" at End Phase, which also includes revealing Wattfox.</li></ul><p>6) There is nothing else to do right now. So, if you have Wattfox + Samsara in-hand, jump into End Phase but not before changing the button at the lower right corner of the screen to ""ON"" to not miss anything...</p><ol><li>Change ""Card Position"" from ""Manual"" to ""Auto"" because there will be lots of Special Summoning and you don't want to waste any time with manual labor.</li><li>Start by discarding your whole hand with ""Into the Void"". Then, use ""Gift Exchange"" to give your opponent Maxx ""C"".</li><li>Activate Samsara to Special Summon it. There are two different outcomes, which will be in your favor:<ul><li>If your opponent doesn't activate Maxx ""C"", they will be burned to the death by Catbat. Reason is that Wanghu will destroy Samsara, which is where Catbat points to. Then, Catbat deals damage because a monster (Samsara) this card points to has been destroyed.</li><li>Knowing that your opponent is scared of death, they can activate Maxx ""C"" and you may move onto next step.</li></ul></li><li>After the activation of Maxx ""C"", chain into Hela by tributing Hela and targeting Wattfox in GY to Special Summon it. Even though Wattfox isn't Zombie by default, ""Rebirth Judgment"" changed the outcome in that regard, so that Hela can be able to pick Wattfox.</li><li>With Chain Link 3 ended, everything has been done in order. So, Wanghu will destroy Samsara and Wattfox. Samsara isn't important but Wanghu destroying Wattfox is a huge deal. Your opponent can't be able to activate anything to stop this Mill + Burn combo now.</li><li>Since your opponent can't activate anything, that includes Wanghu destroying Samsara. Kindly return Wanghu to where it belongs by pressing the button of ""Shien's Spy"".</li><li>Finally, you can Special Summon Samsara and Wanghu can destroy it. Meanwhile, your opponent draws one by one and takes damage, all thanks to Maxx ""C"" and Catbat. Repeat this process until your opponent is demolished...<ul><li>If you wish, for convenience, you can change the button at the lower right corner of the screen to ""OFF"" and Activation Order Settings to ""Off"". Therefore, you will be always asked whether you want to Special Summon Samsara or not, without Baronne asking what to do.</li></ul></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Rebirth Judgment"" can be collected by purchasing ""Cybernetic Successor"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Raigeki"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Hela, Generaider Boss of Doom"" can be found within ""Worthy Adversaries"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Temple of the Kings"" can be found within ""Guardian of Kings"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Meanwhile, activate ""Infinite Cards"" to not discard anything, which will matter later on.</p><p>3) Skip your Draw Phase with Dugares/Offerings. Next, set ""Primal Seed"" + ""Gift Exchange"". Then, destroy ""Light Barrier"" with Baronne and end your turn. Don't forget to skip your opponent's turn with Arcana.</p><p>4) With ""Primal Seed"" loop, fetch ""Monster Reborn"" + ""Offerings to the Doomed"" + ""Necroface"". Revive Ancient + Martial with ""Monster Reborn"" and bring forth Ruddy with these two to send everything from GY to BZ. Then, Normal Summon Necroface to shuffle everything from BZ into Main/Extra Deck.&nbsp; You can destroy Necroface with Offerings to not draw a card, up to you.</p><p>5) Play ""Gift Exchange"" and target ""Primal Seed"" to keep the engine running. Then, target anything but Quick-Play spell cards with ""Gift Exchange"", until your opponent has nothing in Main Deck.</p><p>6) When the time has come, destroy ME-PSY-YA with Baronne and end your turn. First, use Arcana to skip your opponent's turn by sending Ruddy + Baronne to GY. Then, hold your opponent's cards with ""Gift Exchange"".</p><p>7) Finally, it's your turn. Activate CED to deal lethal damage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force XXI - The World"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Primal Seed + Yado + Angineer,"<p>Greetings! In this deck, we will FTK our opponent with ""Slash Draw"". Unlike other builds you might have seen around, this is really consistent to setup. All it takes is placing cards from your hand to bottom of your deck with Yado + Angineer duo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFMx6-Imb7M"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Baronne is around, Link Summon Saryuja. Then, place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop.</p><p>2) Thanks to monsters being revived by ""Monster Reborn"", XYZ Summon Angineer by using 2 x Level 3 monsters (Martial/Integrator/Shamisen) as materials. Then, Special Summon Yado with Saryuja in Attack Position. This is important, don't summon Yado in Defense Position.</p><p>3) Fill your opponent's side by reviving your monsters with ""Monster Reborn"" and passing monsters to them with ""Shien's Spy"". Meanwhile, empty your Main Deck completely by drawing everything and fill your side with ""Monster Reborn"" as well.</p><p>4) Activate Angineer and target on Yado to change it from Attack to Defense Position. Here, you can activate Yado and count down how many cards your opponent controls. If you have filled the opposing side and you went first, there should be 5. So, place any 5 cards but ""Slash Draw"" from your hand at the bottom of your Main Deck, one by one. Yado's ability is similar to Saryuja's. Then, place 6th and final one, which has to be ""Slash Draw""...</p><ul><li>Rather than Angineer, there are other cards which let you change Yado into Defense Position. You can check them in ""Side Deck"".</li></ul><p>5) Destroy ME-PSY-YA with Baronne because game checks whether cards were sent into GY or not, if you play ""Slash Draw"". So, with that out of the way, activate ""Slash Draw"" for the massive FTK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Slash Draw"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 60 SR and 120 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 510 SR and 240 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Then, send Number 13 to GY, either as Link Material for Saryuja or with Ravenous/Wok.</p><p>2) Send Wanghu + Enchanter + Snow to GY, which is possible with Ancient/Ravenous/Dugares. You have to send at least two of them and third one can be Special Summoned with Saryuja.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Also, feel free to clear everything but Chaos Emperor with ""Mystik Wok"".</p><p>4) Revive Number 13 with ""Monster Reborn"" and overlay into Number 43 with ""Rank-Up-Magic Launch"". Place Number 43 on Extra Monster Zone (EMZ) for convenience.</p><p>5) Revive ""Cold Enchanter"" and you can start accumulating Ice Counters with its ability to boost its ATK. However, I have a better idea: Revive Wanghu &gt;&gt;&gt; Snow in explained order. There, Wanghu destroys Snow and Snow triggers its ability to place Ice Counter on every face-up monster present.</p><p>6) Revive Snow as many times as you can, while placing Ice Counters everywhere and boosting the ATK of ""Cold Enchanter"". When the ATK of Enchanter is higher than your opponent's LP, activate ""Mystik Wok"" and target on Enchanter. By choosing its ATK, you will gain lots of LP. There, Number 43 will convert said amount as damage to kill your opponent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""King Tiger Wanghu"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 570 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems.

If you are looking at this deck, it means you are a fellow Treasure Panda player. Perhaps, you are also looking for how to guide ""Treasure Panda"" decks? Whatever your reason is, I'm willing to help you, with in-depth analysis of key cards and whatnot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">BASICS</span></strong></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">- Treasure Panda decks rely on banishing Spell/Trap cards from your GY to Special Summon Normal Monster, ranging from Level 1 to 3. It's mostly used in conjuction with Level 1 monsters, so that you can do the following:</span></p><ol><li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Play ""Upstart Goblin"" or ""Into the Void"".</span></li><li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Special Summon Level 1 monster.</span></li><li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Target on that fella with ""Wonder Wand"" or any target spells to draw more cards.</span></li><li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">When you are out of Level 1 monsters, play ""Pot of Avarice"" and/or ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" to refill your Main Deck.</span></li><li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Repeat everything from the beginning.</span></li></ol><p>- This is essential part of playing ""Treasure Panda"" decks. No matter what your plan is, you will repeat these steps above. However, there is still much to learn...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">MAIN TOOLS</span></strong></p><p>- Let's have a look at what we have. Then, we can check out <a href=""/deck/substitute-arsenal-of-panda-424236"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>alternative cards,</strong></a>&nbsp;whether it's due to crafting costs (SR/UR) or preferences...</p><ul><li style=""text-align: left;""><strong>T.G. Hyper Librarian:&nbsp;</strong>Most valuable player, ditto. Besides Treasure Panda, everything is centered around Librarian. Reason is that each time you Synchro Summon, you draw a card, and Treasure Panda decks utilize Synchro Summoning mechanics a lot. You can check this Synchro Summon hierarchy to see what I mean...<br /><ol><li style=""text-align: left;""><p>If you open up with Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Panda, this is how you can play with...</p><ul><li>Assuming that you have always spells to draw, this is how: Monk + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Level 1 Tuner &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Shamisen &gt;&gt;&gt; Shamisen + Non-Tuner = Cthugua &gt;&gt;&gt; Bring Shamisen back onto the battlefield and shuffle Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Shamisen + Non-Tuner = Cthugua &gt;&gt;&gt; Cthugua + Cthugua = Number 60 &gt;&gt;&gt; Draw four cards with Number 40! &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Tuner = Ravenous &gt;&gt;&gt; Saryuja</li></ul></li><li><p>If you start only with Panda, this is how you can play with:</p><ul><li>Tuner + Non-Tuner = Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Martial &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial brings Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Martial + Integrator = Stardust &gt;&gt;&gt; Stardust (Tuner due to Martial) + Non-Tuner = Ancient &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient pulls Monk/Panda &gt;&gt;&gt; Monk/Panda + Tuner = Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Ancient + Tuner = Accel &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel pulls Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula + Non-Tuner = Shamisen &gt;&gt;&gt; Shamisen + Non-Tuner = Cthugua &gt;&gt;&gt; Bring Shamisen back onto the battlefield and shuffle Formula &gt;&gt;&gt; Shamisen + Non-Tuner = Cthugua &gt;&gt;&gt; Cthugua + Cthugua = Number 60 &gt;&gt;&gt; Draw four cards with Number 40! &gt;&gt;&gt; Accel + Tuner = Ravenous &gt;&gt;&gt; Saryuja</li></ul></li></ol></li><li><strong>Summoner Monk:</strong> If you don't open with Panda, you can play Monk to pull Panda from your Main Deck by discarding a spell.</li><li><strong>Upstart Goblin / Into the Void / Allure of Darkness:&nbsp;</strong>Your openers when Panda is present, so that you can start pulling out Level 1 dudes.</li><li><strong>Wonder Wand / Spellbook of Knowledge / White Elephant's Gift / Moray of Avarice: </strong>When you have pulled out Level 1 dude with Panda, you can use your target spells to draw 2 cards.</li><li><strong>Pot of Acquisitiveness:&nbsp;</strong>Since ""Allure of Darkness"" and ""Moray of Avarice"" draw cards while banishing, if you hit Level 1 dudes, you can recover them with this Pot card.</li><li><strong>Pot of Avarice:&nbsp;</strong>Whenever you are out of resources when it comes to Level 1 monsters, don't forget to play this Pot.</li><li><strong>Magical Mallet / Reload:&nbsp;</strong>If you brick, use these cards to find a way out.</li><li><strong>Formula / Integrator / Stardust / Ravenous: </strong>Your draw abilities as Synchros.</li><li><strong>Martial / Shamisen / Ancient / Accel:&nbsp;</strong>Your extenders as Synchros. It means they Special Summon extra bodies or themselves with their abilities. Feel free to check Synchro Summon hierarchy explained in Librarian part to see what I mean.</li><li><strong>Number 60:&nbsp;</strong>Your draw ability as XYZ. Thanks to 2 x Cthuguas present, you can overlay into Number 60 and draw up to 4 cards! Pretty cool, isn't it? Depending on your plan, feel free to use its Special Summon ability.</li><li><strong>Saryuja:</strong> Your draw ability as Link. Better used when you have 4 cards in Main Deck since Saryuja lets you draw 4 cards, if you use 4 materials for Saryuja. Even though you have to shuffle back three cards in the end, that concludes your drawing session. Depending on your plan, feel free to use its Special Summon ability.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">SIDE TOOLS</span></strong></p><p>- Here are your <a href=""/deck/substitute-arsenal-of-panda-424236"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>optional cards,</strong></a> where you can substitute them:</p><ul><li><strong>Cup of Ace: </strong>""Pot of Greed"" with a gamble. Either you or your opponent draws 2 cards. It's similar to ""Allure of Darkness"" but you can let your opponent draw cards with ""Cup of Ace"". With Allure, you either draw or lose everything, without giving your opponent anything.</li><li><strong>One Day of Peace / Dark World Dealings / Hand Destruction / Fortune Fairy Chee: </strong>These cards allow both sides to draw.</li><li><strong>Fragrance Storm:&nbsp;</strong>A conditional ""Wonder Wand"", literally. You target a Level 1 Plant to destroy it and draw a card. However, if you want to draw 2, your first draw has to be a Plant. If you replace Level 1 Spellcasters (Exodias/Idol) with Level 1 Plant monsters, replace 3 x Wonder Wand + 1 x Spellbook of Knowledge with 3 x Fragrance Storm.</li><li><strong>Moray of Greed:&nbsp;</strong>If you add this card, you need to replace Level 1 Spellcasters with Level 1 Water monsters. I think 8 x Level 1 Water monsters with 2 x Moray of Greed in mind is fair but proceed with caution.</li><li><strong>Where Arf Thou?:&nbsp;</strong>This helps you tutor Level 1 monsters, which can harmonize well with ""Moray of Greed"", if you choose that path. I guess 1-2 copies shall suffice but consider with caution.</li><li><strong>Spellbook of Secrets:&nbsp;</strong>You can tutor ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" with this card. 1 x Secrets is enough.</li><li><strong>Spellbook of the Master:&nbsp;</strong>If you haven't banished ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" with Panda but want to use Knowledge another time to draw 2 more cards, Master can help you out. 1 x Master is enough.</li><li><strong>Advance Draw: </strong>Since Accel and Ravenous sit idle after they were used, you can Tribute them to draw 2 cards. As you can see, 1 x Advance Draw is enough.</li><li><strong>Celestial Observatory / Sacred Sword of Seven Stars / Trade-In / Kuji-Kiri Curse / Tokusano Shinkyojin: </strong>Similar to ""Advance Draw"", if your setup allows to, you can add these cards to to target Level 6-7-8-9-10 cards and draw accordingly. Just be mindful of hard/soft once per turn rulings.</li><li><strong>Gold Moon Coin:&nbsp;</strong>To draw 2 cards, you have to give your opponent 2 cards of yours.</li><li><strong>Monster Recovery + Link Bound: </strong>If you feel like crafting whole Extra Deck can break the bank, just craft Saryuja and add these two spells. Since the draw effect of Saryuja isn't hard once per turn, you can return Saryuja with these cards to Extra Deck and try again. Feel free to replace one copy of ""Reload"" with ""Monster Recovery"" and only add 1 x Link Bound, see how it goes.</li><li><strong>Anchamoufrite:&nbsp;</strong>If you have removed every card in Extra Deck but Saryuja, consider adding 1 x Anchamoufrite. When Saryuja is present, you can use its Pendulum ability to draw a card, since your Extra Deck has 0 cards anyways.</li><li><strong>Performapal Guitartle + Performapal Lizardraw:&nbsp;</strong>Alternative Pendulum duo, which draws cards like Anchamoufrite. First, activate Guitartle. Then, activate Lizardraw. Here, Guitartle draws a card and then, you can destroy Lizardraw to draw another card.</li><li><strong>Link Spider:</strong> If your Extra Deck has only Saryuja, this spider can alleviate your overload by pulling out 1 x Normal Monster from your hand, which enables you to play target spells such as ""Wonder Wand"". 1 x Link Spider is enough because it's hard-once per turn.</li><li><strong>Cards of Consonance: </strong>""Flamvell Guard"" is a Dragon Tuner with 100 ATK, which fits the criteria for ""Cards of Consonance"". If you don't want to craft ""Moray of Avarice"" since it's UR, consider replacing ""Water Spirit"" cards with ""Flamvell Guard"" and add 1-2 x Consonance.</li><li><strong>Soul Absorption + Ancient Leaf:&nbsp;</strong>This duo work well in harmony. Reason is that, as you banish spells with Panda, you will gain 500 LP for each. When you have 9000+ LP, you pay 2000 LP to draw 2 cards. If your setup relies on banishing stuff for gaining LP, this duo is amazing to have but only if you lack some cards.</li><li><strong>Tilted Try / Chicken Game:&nbsp;</strong>Field Spells which help you draw cards. If the setup you made doesn't require you to burn your opponent to death, 3 x Chicken Game is alright to have. As for ""Tilted Try"", it acts like this: Let's say you have drawn card(s) with ""Upstart Goblin"" and/or ""Wonder Wand"" but you didn't like the results. Here, you can activate ""Tilted Try"" to shuffle one of drawn cards to bottom of your deck and then you draw a card. After it, ""Tilted Try"" will be detonated, which means a free resource for Panda and thinning your deck.</li><li><strong>Daigusto Emeral:&nbsp;</strong>A mini Pot of Avarice, alternative to Dugares.</li><li><strong>Mannadium Trisukta:</strong> Alternative to Accel, since Accel is UR to craft. What Accel did was to Special Summon Level 2 Tuner and Trisukta does no different. However, you have to replace it with ""Stardust Charge Warrior"".</li><li><strong>Coral Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Alternative to ""Stardust Charge Warrior"", Coral does what Stardust do: Draw a card.</li><li><strong>Toon Table of Contents + Toon Bookmark: </strong>Tutor cards which fetch Toon cards from your deck to your hand. To thin your deck, here is an example of Toon package but feel free to refer <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Card_Tips:Toon_Bookmark"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>this page</strong></a> to make a setup of your own: 3 x Toon Table of Contents &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 x Toon Bookmark &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 x Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 x Trade-In.</li><li><strong>Card of Fate:&nbsp;</strong>Draw a random card from your Main Deck. May RNG be with you and 1 x Card of Fate is enough.</li><li><strong>Synchro Creed: </strong>You can add 1 x Synchro Creed to draw card(s), assuming you control Synchro monster(s). If you control 1 x Synchro, you draw 1 card. If you control 3+ Synchros, you can draw 2 cards.</li><li><strong>Performage Hat Tricker:</strong> If you consider Summoner Monk as expensive to craft (SR) but still want to bring forth Librarian easily, might I suggest Hat Tricker? You can Special Summon it as many times as you want, as long as there are 2+ monsters on the field. Also, since it's Spellcaster, you can target it with ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"".</li><li><strong>Pot of Greed / Graceful Charity / Terraforming: </strong>These are banned cards, which help you draw cards. Yet, I just wanted to mention them.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 18pt;"">CONCLUSION</span></strong></p><p>So, that's all for this guide. Let me know what you think or how we can improve this guide. Any feedback/suggestion is greatly appreciated. I tried my best to cover everything but let me know if I have missed anything, be it for substitutes or whatever. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Outrace your opponents all the way to Masters 1!,"<div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">""Gold Pride"" seems to be tailor made specifically to play with PUNK. Not only are the cards aesthetically similar, both archetypes reward the duelist for paying/losing lifepoints - allowing them to draw cards, special summon combo pieces, and power up their boss monsters (10300ATK Psychic End Punisher anyone?)! The inherent synergy is immense since PUNK naturally combos into Gold Pride and the lifepoint payments by PUNK allow all Gold Pride monsters to special summon themselves for free!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The deck's end board from only one Ze Amin + 1 discard is composed of 3 pops (Start Your Engines, Star Leon and PUNK Nashiwari Surprise), non-targeting/destroying monster removal (Pin Baller) and 3 cards draw (PUNK Jam Session and Better Luck Next Time!). Not only that, but follow-up for the grind game is also generated by the constant summons of Captain Carrie, searching your starter ""Start Your Engines"" during your turn and your opponent's turn! If allowed to combo off, this deck ends with a full board, and a 6 card hand full of hand traps/follow-up. This deck also is infamous for easily bringing out Psychic End Punisher, a ""towers"" monster that most decks are unprepared to deal with.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><p style=""text-align: center; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

It is 50 cards since one Ze Amin + discard is full combo, and there are 15 copies of Ze Amin (3 Ze Amin, 3 Ogre, 3 Foxy Tune, 3 Emergency Teleport and 3 Small World) giving the duelist a fair chance of drawing into it with their starting hand. 50 cards also make it less likely that you will hard draw your garnets (Sharakusai, Deer Note, Wa Gon and Jam Session) that are essential for the combo. Trust me, 50 cards is still surprisingly consistent and totally not bricky!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The two archetypes in this deck are of course Gold Pride (12 cards) and PUNK (15 cards). PUNK cards are your starters for the main combo while Gold Pride are extenders that your board generally ends on. Including Small World and Emergency Teleport, this deck has 14 ways to Ze Amin which is full combo.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Many handtraps are included, meaning that going second, you still have a decent chance of stopping your opponent since your starting hand probably contains 1-2 handtraps. Going first, you have a great chance of drawing into them, since the PUNK + Gold Pride combo draws you three cards. Handtraps are also Small World bridges to search Ze Amin (to start your combo). In games 2-3, these handtraps are exchanged for the going-second cards in your side deck. </span><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;"">PUNK Gold Pride can somewhat play through some interruption because it has a ridiculous amount of extenders (every Gold Pride monster summons itself for free!), but the strategy can be significantly easier to play if the board state is equalized, that's why many handtraps are used in this deck.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">In the Extra Deck, there is sadly no reliable way this deck can make level 10 Synchros anymore with the limit of Psy-Frame Gamma, so Baronne and Stardust Assault Synchron are replaced by a Zeus package of Fortune Tune + Downerd Magician. Knightmare Phoenix, Knightmare Unicorn and Accesscode are included in case your opponent activates Dimension Barrier against you, locking out Synchros. You can still OTK easily with links instead, since this strategy swarms the board very easily with plenty of material.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The strategy of PUNK Gold Pride is to destroy/remove your opponent's cards while building as much resource advantage as it can with multiple draws and searches. True to the ""racing vs. your opponent"" theme of the deck, PUNK Gold Pride's win condition is building up as much momentum as possible (card advantage and board presence). The more momentum you have, the more unstoppable are!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The combo for this strategy is the standard PUNK combo -&gt; Gold Pride combo.

Alternatively, Leon can quick synchro with Dragon Drive on board to bounce 4 cards with Amazing Dragon. Roller Baller can quick fusion to equip monsters your opponent controls. Your set Start your Engines! pops a monster. Your set PUNK trap also either negates/destroys. You also likely have many handtraps in hand. You have 4 guaranteed interruptions, probably 1-3+ handtraps, and follow-up for next turn! That's about 5-7 interruptions for your opponent to contend with, and you have more than enough resources to OTK your opponent next turn.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you're interrupted mid-combo, your plan B is to summon Psychic End Punisher to stall for next turn's counterattack, since most decks cannot out it easily.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Going second, hopefully your handtraps simplify the gamestate enough to the point your in-engine combo and extenders are enough to allow you to play the game through your opponent's interruption.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The PUNK Gold Pride pilot has a plethora of options to clear the board and OTK going second based on the gamestate:&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;A 4 material Zeus is easily summoned with 2 level 3s -&gt; Fortune Tune -&gt; Battle Phase attack -&gt; Zeus. Gold Pride Star Leon and Pin Baller clear the boards of monsters while Captain Carrie's effect in the GY turn them into 4000+ ATK beatsticks. PUNK Gold Pride also easily turbos out Psychic End Punisher, a nigh unstoppable ""towers"" monster capable of a 1 shot kill that many decks are unprepared to face. Amazing Dragon synchro summoned with Rising Carp and Ze Amin clears 2-4 cards from the board while enabling it to attack twice with 3600ATK (7200DMG). Finally, Accesscode is available to OTK as well since this deck swarms the field very easily with lots of link material. Accesscode is a good alternative in case you get D-barrier locked from Synchros.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></div><ul style=""list-style-type: disc;""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you get hit by Maxx ""C,"" Droll &amp; Lockbird or Dimension Shifter, your plan B synchro summon Psychic End Punisher. Chances are that your opponent cannot out this monster and you'll be alive next turn to continue counterattack without committing too much of your resources.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">PUNK Gold Pride has an in-engine way to hardcounter the current strongest meta deck! Vs. Kashtira, make summoning Nytro Head a priority. The token it generates on your opponent's board during their Standby Phase makes plays very awkward for Kashtira, if not outright shutting down their entire strategy.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Keep close track of your dangerously low lifepoints and keep your monsters in defense position unless you know you can attack for game! If you're not careful, Masquerade the Blazing Dragon's 600 lifepoint tax, Sky Striker Ace Hayate's direct attack, or Swordsoul Longyuan's 1200 damage burn can quickly end your duel.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This deck's endboard folds to common board wipes like Evenly Matched and Raigeki, since it has no easy way to negate spells and traps (the limit of Psyframe Gamma makes this deck's S/T negate Baronne, difficult to make). If you feel like your opponent will attempt to boardwipe you, end your board with Psychic End Punisher so you can at least have board presence that can shrug off these high impact cards. If you're allowed full combo, you also likely have 3-6 cards in hand with many of them handtraps, so if you get boardwiped it's not the end of the duel for you.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you're feeling truly brave, a 60 card version of the deck is possible by including the card Dark Spirit's Mastery into the deck. Not only does it search Ogre Dance (which in turn searching Ze Amin), but it also searches Lava Golem, a potent board breaker! With Dark Spirit's Mastery, you have a consistent PUNK deck despite having the maximum 60 cards, since it has 17 copies of Ze Amin.&nbsp;</span></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Not only does Small World search Ze Amin to start your combo, it also searches incredible board breakers such as Kurikara and Lava Golem (Feel free to include these guys in your deck). From my experience nobody really negates Small World since they'd rather negate a choke point in a combo, so Small World is a great card to open with so you can start clearing your opponent's board.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p style=""text-align: center; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Just like the racers in the movie lived on the edge of life and death during dangerous racing, it is the same with YOU, the duelist who gets rewarded the lower your lifepoints are! If you play this deck, you MUST watch the movie <em>Redline </em>to learn where these cards came from - it'll make you appreciate the deck even more!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The fact that it synergizes so well with another favourite strategy of mine - PUNKS, makes my heart so happy since I really appreciate the Cyberpunk aesthetic both archetypes portray. The handtrap heavy, momentum based gameplay is the style of Yugioh I personally find fun, and PUNK Gold Pride is a perfect deck for that. I feel like an absolute badass ending on a board with a ton of disruptions (no negates so my opponent can actually play) and having a full hand with handtraps/follow-up for next turn!</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>&nbsp;</em></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>TURN UP YOUR SPEED TO THE MAXIMUM AND OUTRACE YOUR OPPONENTS!</em></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">GLHF Duelists! <br /></span></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Sure, it can be searched off of&nbsp;<strong>Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage</strong> and have its Summoning requirement easily fulfilled in a HERO Deck, but at the same time, its effect to pop a monster on field and inflict damage really isn't all that useful considering the other things you are able to do in HERO. And then we get to the monster that we are looking at today:&nbsp;<strong>Winged Kuriboh LV9</strong>. It is a Level 9 LIGHT Fairy Monster that can be Special Summoned from hand using its activated effect which can only be activated as Chain Link 3 or higher. While it is on field, Spell Cards that have been activated are banished instead of being sent to GY and its ATK/DEF become equal to the number of Spells in your opponent's GY x500. Like I never read the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX manga (I've only read the Arc-V manga which is hella wierd), but I don't know if this is the exact effect that it had in the manga, and I surely cannot even imagine what situation would call for a monster like this whose effect goes against its literal ATK/DEF gaining ability. If its ATK/DEF is determined by the number of Spells in your opponent's GY, why does it banish them instead of sending them to the GY? When we put LV9 into the context of Prediction Princess, we have another issue: It is a Fairy monster which means that you cannot target it with&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> from the Deck because it, too, is a Fairy. Kuriboh as an archetype has some pretty fun and unique cards to support themselves, but we can't really make use of them as we are trying to specifically make use of Winged Kuriboh LV9 here, and the only cards that have anything to do with Winged Kuriboh are&nbsp;<strong>Sabatiel - The Philosopher's Stone</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Berserker Crush</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Transcendent Wings</strong>. Berserker Crush and Transcendentn Wings are immediately out since they do things we do not need to focus on, and while Flute of Summoning Kuriboh is really nice as a theoretical way to extend, we need Level 9's in this Deck, not access to a Level 1. That leaves us with Sabatiel which is actually pretty nice in this Deck. If you have a Winged Kuriboh monster on field or in GY,&nbsp; you can pay half your LP to add a Polymerization or Fusion Spell from Deck to hand similar to&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</strong>, and you've seen how I have been using Cobra to get us to&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> to access&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> who can get us Bibliomuse from the Deck. That is pretty much the only upside to this Deck. I would've tossed Winged Kuriboh LV9 alongside&nbsp;<strong>Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath</strong> if it wasn't for Sabatiel and the theoretical chance that you could search for Instant Fusion with the help of Winged Kuriboh. I'm not telling you to play this Deck. It really is pretty lackluster considering that the only upside is being able to search for Instant Fusion sometimes. The combo that worked for me is&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Winged Kuriboh LV9</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. Normal Summon Diviner and use its effect to send&nbsp;<strong>Trias Hierarchia</strong> from Deck to GY. Activate Trias Hierarchia to Tribute Diviner and Summon itself from GY. Diviner triggers upon being Tributed as Chain Link 1. Chain Link 2 World Legacy Monstrosity targeting Hierarchia. Chain Link 3 Winged Kuriboh LV9 from hand. Winged Kuriboh Special Summons itself from hand. Monstrosity Special Summons&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> from Deck. Diviner Special Summons&nbsp;<strong>Winged Kuriboh</strong> from Deck. There are a couple of things you can do here. If you want to protect yourself from handtraps potentially at this point, you can Xyz Hierarchia and Winged Kuriboh LV9 into&nbsp;<strong>Sacred Tree Beast Hyperyton</strong> who will act as a monster negate, and you can keep it on field going into your opponent's turn for a monster negate on their turn as well. Or, you can Xyz that Hierarchia and Winged Kuriboh LV9 into&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> for an interruption on your opponent's turn. But let's say you make Hyperyton here. Now Xyz Deus-X and Kaku into&nbsp;<strong>Merelogic Aggregator</strong>, sending&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> from Extra Deck to GY, search, reattach to Aggregator, then we Link Aggregator and Winged Kuriboh into&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, and Herald triggers again for another search. Prediction Princess shenanigans, you know the deal. Can't really do much if you don't have a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell already in your opening hand or if you drew Bibliomuse, but do what you can. We are playing&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> to make up for it. And if you activate a Spell, you can attach it from GY to Hyperyton to give it the chance to negate a Spell. Deck is aight. Not great. Don't play this. There are plenty of other better Prediction Princess versions you can look at.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3<strong> Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during your End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei&rsquo;s End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect Special Summons a Flip Monster from your Deck face-down and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from the GY face-down if she is Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 1 <strong>Trias Hierarchia</strong> which is a Level 9 that can Tribute a Fairy to Special Summon itself from hand or GY. 2 <strong>Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Sky Stag</strong> which is a Level 9 we can easily Summon from hand and it can also be Special Summoned from Deck with Monstrosity. 3&nbsp;<strong>Winged Kuriboh LV9</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Winged Kuriboh</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> which can send a Fairy monster from Deck or Extra Deck to GY on Normal or Special Summon and increase its Level by the Level of the sent monster. And if it is Tributed, you can Special Summon a Level 2 or lower Fairy monster from hand or Deck except for itself.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Spell/Traps: 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which can Ritual Summon a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or face-down and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. 2&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Ritual&nbsp;</strong>which specifically Ritual Summons Prediction Princess Tarotrei and you can banish it from GY except the turn it was sent there to search for a Prediction Princess monster from Deck. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Sabatiel - The Philosopher's Stone</strong>. If you have a Winged Kuriboh monster on field or in GY, you can pay half your LP to add a Polymerization or Fusion Spell from Deck to hand and if it is in GY, you can banish 3 copies of it from GY and target a monster on the field to have it gain ATK equal to the ATK of the monster on field with the highest ATK until the end fo the turn. You are not really going to be using that second effect, but it will be really funny if you manage to pull it off in some fashion. 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which either Special Summons 1&nbsp;Level 9 monster from your hand or targets a Level 9 monster you control to Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from your Deck with a different Type and Attribute than that monster but with different names. And finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Small World</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong> which can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 1&nbsp;<strong>Chaos Angel&nbsp;</strong>which you can make since Winged Kuriboh is a Level 1 LIGHT monster.

Activate the effect of Garura in the GY to add draw 1 card.&nbsp;</p><p>Now unlike a lot of decks Ritual Dogmatika Combo relies on what cards you have in your opening hand. Although you have many cards that can ""search"" and add 1 or sometimes even 2 cards from deck to hand like Ecclesia, Nadir, Dogmatikamatrix and Pre-Preparation of Rites. All which at 3 copies in this deck for a total 12 searchers. The power level of your board going first or second Depends on the scenario, skill and understanding of the player.</p><p>Here's where go from here&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp; After activitng the effect of Garura, Normal Summon Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous add Dogmatikamatrix. Activate Dogmatikamatrix and add 1 Dogmatika Ritual Monster or Dogmatika Ritual Spell to your hand, and if your opponent controls a monster you can 1 addtional Dogmatika card in this case we'll add White Knight of Dogmatika.&nbsp;</p><p>- Now we will assume we've opened well, and that the other card 2 card we have in our hand are Dogmatikalamity and Dogmatika Maximus. Banish Garura to summon Dogmatika Maximus and activiate Maximus's effect. Both player will then send 2 cards from the Extra Deck to the GY. Send Herald of Arc Light and El Shaddoll Apkallone, Activate the effect of both Herald of Arc Light and El Shaddoll Apkallone to add Ohime the Manifested Mikanko and Shaddoll Schism, then discard 1 other card.</p><p>- Activate Dogmatikalamity to Ritual Summon White Knight of Dogmatika sending from deck to the GY Titaniklad the Ash Dragon. Using the other effect of Dogmatikalamity on field you can send 1 card from your or your opponents Extra Deck. In this case we'll send from our Extra a deck another copy of Herald of Arc Light since the GY effect is not once per turn, we'll activate the effect to add White Relic of Dogmatika. Now we'll activate the effect of Ohime the Manifested Mikanko and add The Great Mikanko Ceremony to hand then send White Relic of Dogmatika to the GY.</p><p>- Next activate The Great Mikanko Ceremony to Special Summon Ohime the Manifested Mikanko. Activate the GY effect of The Great Mikanko Ceremony to send Mikanko Reflection Rondo to the GY. Set Shaddoll Schism and go to the End Phase, in the end phase activate the effect of Titaniklad the Ash Dragon which adds 1 Dogmatika from deck to hand the turn it is sent to the GY.&nbsp; Add Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted and pass turn.</p><p>Here's another line</p><p>- The 2 cards of this sect you want this time is Dogmatikamatrix, Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous and a Dogmatikalamity. Activate Dogmatikamatrix and add 1 White Relic of Dogmatika if you have Dogmatikamacabre or Dogmatika Alba Zoa if you have Dogmatikalamity. Normal Summon Ecclesia and search which ever Ritual Monster you didn't add to hand. In this case we'll Ritual Summon Relic using Dogmatikamacabre sending Ecclesia to the GY.&nbsp; Activate the on field effect of Dogmatikamatrix to send Herald of Arc Light to the GY and add which ever ritual spell you didn't have, in this case we'll add Dogmatikalamity from deck to hand and Then activate it to Ritual Summon Dogmatika Alba Zoa sending Despian Luluwalilith.&nbsp;</p><p>- Activate the effect of Alba Zoa and since they have no monsters that can be return to the Extra Deck the first effect cannot be applied and since the effect has to resolve your opponent will be forced to choose the 2nd effect of Alba Zoa making them Send 7 card from their hand and/or Extra Deck to the GY. And While Relic is on the field your level 8 or higher Dogmatika monster cannot be destoryed by battle make Alba Zoa pretty hard to out.</p><p>Notes and Tips*</p><p>- In the second line if you summon Dogmatika Alba Zoa First you can activate the on summon effect of White Relic of Dogmatika and target Alba Zoa and have White Relic of Dogmatika's atk become 4000!</p><p>- Dogmatika Alba Zoa other field effect makes so that ""Dogmatika"" monsters you control are unaffected by the activated effects of your opponent's Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters and it has 4000 atk!...But other than that it has no other protection from card effects like Raigkei so keep that in mind&nbsp;</p><p>- If your you can't get to main line combo try to make you opponent burn through as much interuption as possible and make a ""low impact"" Play like sending Despian Luluwalilith from Extra Deck something like Dogmatikalamity and during the end activate her to Special Summon Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous and add to hand Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted using Ecclesia on summon effect.</p>"

Still working on the ratios, but so far this has worked the best for me. This is by no means a super competitive build and there are some big choke points in the full combo, but there are some back up options if you're stopped. I'm also not a competitive player, just a casual on ladder. Also the deck is expensive and is not budget friendly.</p><p>Card Explanations:</p><p>Prisma/A Hero Lives (AHL)/E-Call: Heart and soul of the deck. This is your combo starter. You always want to see Prisma or a way into it. AHL is ideal, but normal summoning it works fine, it's just riskier.&nbsp;</p><p>Souls Package (Souls/IOC/Prep): I use three of each for this because you always want to see some way into souls for full combo w/ Prisma. If you don't you can still end on Sprind, Schism, Granguignol, and a token, but you don't get the double bounce with Sprind/Sargas or the omni from Regulus. Illusion of Chaos shuffle back into the deck comes up quite often for cards you don't want to draw (O-Lion, Regulus, Schism). This package also works pretty well as hand trap bait. If you're going second, you can make Anima with Souls and potentially steal a card if you are trying to break a board, but feel free to cut Anima if you'd like to try something else.&nbsp;</p><p>Scareclaw/Starfrost Package: Your combo engine. Gets you into Cross-Sheep, Proxy F Magician, and Astraloud. You can also always fall back into a Baronne and grab Twinsaw in certain situations. (See combo below)</p><p>Cartesia/Granguignol/Luluwalilith: Cartesia is your second Prisma target. Make Granguignol w/ 2nd Prisma + Souls to send Apkellone and add Schism. You can cheat Luluwalilith out with Granguignol on your opponents turn to get an extra monster negate. Also if you have Cartesia + any way into Souls but no Prisma, you can still get into Granguignol for a Winda play. *Note: You will have to detach Granguignol from Sargas if you XYZ'd before you can summon Lulu.*</p><p>Shaddoll Package/Selene: Here to make Winda on your opponents turn. You will normally use this to make your Sprind/Sargas bounces live on Winda summon, so be careful not to use this right away if you can avoid it. Winda summon can also make your Lulu negate live on summon if there is a target for it. Winda also works well as a material for Selene on follow up who can summon back any Spellcaster (Granguignol/Souls/Cartesia) and then link into Accesscode. If you get to Accesscode you should probably be OTK'ing as you'll have 5300 ATK and 4 Links in grave to use for its effect.</p><p>Sprind/Sargas/Regulus/O-Lion: Sargas adds you Regulus while Sprind sends O-lion to GY. This gives you an omninegate on top of Sprind detaching a material from Sargas to bounce, which in turn activates Sargas to bounce/destroy another card.&nbsp;</p><p>ROTA: Extra search for Prisma or Reicheart.</p><p>Hand Traps: Ash is usually a must in MasterDuel as we all know, but I have left out Maxx C (if Konami is reading this, BAN MAXX C) since the deck is 45 cards already, feel free to add this if you'd like. I have yet to mess with a 60 card version of this deck because the deck relies highly on a consistent 2-card combo, but may try it for extra non-engine. Veiler is a must in my opinion as it can be used as a normal summon to make Granguignol if you don't see Souls and have AHL to still make full combo. Imperm is here to dodge Triple Tac/Thrust. I've contemplated adding Droll here as well due to Mannadium/Superheavy. Called by the Grave is must for the occasional Ash/Maxx C negate. You could also add Crossout, but I felt it was not at full potential without Maxx C or Droll.&nbsp;</p><p>This deck wants to go 1st. Some effects, such as Astraloud's can be used when going 2nd, but I have skipped those in the below combo.</p><p>Full Combo: Special summon Souls&gt; Normal summon Prisma &gt; send Visas to GY&gt; make Lightheart&gt; add/activate Planet&gt; add/summon Reicheart &gt; add Arrival &gt; make Cross Sheep &gt; activate Arrival &gt; summon Visas &gt; activate Lightheart GY effect &gt; summon Light heart &gt; make Proxy F &gt; Special Astraloud by banishing Visas/Reicheart &gt; Cross Sheep effect to summon back Prisma. *Note: It is important to make Cross Sheep BEFORE using Arrival as most of the time if you have summoned Souls, Cross Sheep will be your 5th summon. Holding Arrival allows you to play through Nibiru, however it won't be full combo.*</p><p>Second half of combo: use 2nd Prisma effect &gt; send Cartesia to GY &gt; activate Proxy F effect to fuse &gt; make Granguignol (with Souls &amp; Prisma) &gt; send Apkellone to GY &gt; add Schism &gt; overlay Granguignol and Astraloud for Sargas &gt; make Sprind w/ Sheep &amp; Proxy F &gt; send O-Lion to GY w/ Sprind effect &gt; add Regulus by Sargas effect &gt; special summon Regulus using O-lion in the GY. *Note: The O-lion token is not necessary for any part of the combo so feel free to skip its summon, but keeping it in defense w/ Planet on the field can give you an extra pop on follow up. Also feel free to use Souls effect before fusing it off to send Planet to the GY for a draw. This can sometimes net you an added Hand Trap, but you lose out on the follow up pop.*</p><p>Your endboard should look like this: Sprind (Bounce), Sargas (Bounce/Destroy), Schism (&gt;Winda (SS floodgate)), Regulus (Omni), &amp; a token. You should also have Granguignol's effect to summon Lulu (monster negate) once you've detached from Sargas for his effect. Also, ALWAYS PLAY YOUR MONSTERS IN DEFENSE ON TURN 1 EXCEPT WINDA. Winda is the exception because you don't want your opponent to just run her over with their normal summon. This will protect you from board wipes and will make your Planet live at the start of your next turn.&nbsp;</p><p>On followup: If your board is relatively unscathed at the end of your opponents turn, you can simply link into Selene w/ Sprind+Winda, bring back a Spellcaster w/ Selene's effect, and link into Accesscode for game. *Note: you should usually make Selene w/ Winda or Winda's effect will stop you from making Accesscode! Also Winda can only attack other monsters, so she is no good anyway if you're attacking for game unless there is a monster on your opponents field.&nbsp;</p><p>Other Techs: This combo can end on a plethora of other things as well, so experiment as you like. I've used Draglubion + Heart Earth (w/ Barian Shark attached) to rank up into Ultimate Falcon, Desavewurm (GY) + Avramax + Hope Harbinger, Sprind + Hope Harbinger, and a more Branded heavy package in different builds of the deck and I'm sure there are other ways it could combo forever, but there are only so many ED spaces. I also cut a small Dogmatika package to reduce bricking, but Ecclesia could theoretically be added off of Lulu if your opponent outs it or summoned off of Granguignol instead of Lulu, which in turn would add you Fleur de Lis. This felt a bit unnecessary to me, but it's there if you want it.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall the deck is relatively fragile yet fun and doesn't necessarily FTK, but gets pretty close. Hope you enjoy!</p>"

For convenience, change ""Card Position"" to ""Auto"" and ""Activation Order Settings"" to ""Off"" before the match to save lots of time without doing any major manual labor.)</p><p>Greetings! Are you looking for a way to kill your opponent slow and steady? Well, you come into right place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVTRP0yzjDE"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Fill your side and clear it with ""Thunder Crash"" while dealing some damage. Then, place Pendulum Monsters on Pendulum Zones.</p><p>2) Pendulum Summon Flamvell/Spirit + Clear + Clear + Magicat + Vacuumen. ""Vacuumen"" has to be in Attack Position, rest can be in any position. Then, equip ""Deep-Seated"" on Vacuumen and use Vacuumen to send Deep-Seated to GY and deal some damage. However, Deep-Seated will be returned to top of your deck, which can be considered as a loop.</p><p>3) Synchro Summon Paladin by using 5 monsters as materials. When you do that, 2 x Clear will draw 2 cards in total and Magicat is going to ask if you want to return a spell from your GY on top of your deck, akin to Deep-Seated. You can activate Magicat or not, up to you.</p><p>4) Return all materials used for Paladin to the field with ""De-Synchro"". Don't forget to place Vacuumen in Attack Position like before. Since you have drawn Deep-Seated, you can use Vacuumen again. Thank goodness Vacuumen's ability isn't hard-once per turn.</p><p>5) Repeat step #3 for another time. There, you have to activate ""Magicat"" and place ""De-Synchro"" on top of your deck like ""Deep-Seated"". So, it's for certain you will draw De-Synchro + Deep-Seated every single time.</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #4 + #5 until the opponent is dead. This will take a long while and I hope you can make it on time. However, chances are highly likely your opponent quits even before all of that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

All of my friends are in it.,"<p><em>""I'm here to see M.F. Purrely.""&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>""M.F. Purrely?""</em></p><hr /><p>A basic pure Purrely deck (post Jan. 2024 list update) that relies heavily on your knowing more on how to play Pok&eacute;mon TCG than you do Yu-Gi-Oh. The archetype, for those unfamiliar, consists of Level 1 Fairy Monsters with Rank 2 and 7 Xyz Monsters with effects that rely on attaching materials to help grow and develop with their user. Most Purrely decks require a large portion of the deck to be dedicated to its cards, but some other archetypes (i.e., Ghostrick and Spright) can utilize Purrely cards. This, however, is a specifically Purrely-focused deck.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h2>The Basic Strategy (Look at my funny cat cards)&nbsp;</h2><p>Your two biggest main deck cards are the Level 1 Fairies, <strong>Purrely</strong> and <strong>Purrelyly</strong>, also known as the <em>Purly Brothe rs</em>:&nbsp;</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/271079404568969217/1196982474937479228/purly_brothers.png"" alt=""THE PURLY BROTH ERS"" width=""255"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>Their main goal is to get its Rank 7 Xyz Boss Monster, <strong>Expurrely Noir</strong>, the most Towers of any Towers that has ever Tower-ed. With Expurrely Noir (1100 Atk, 2800 Def), you have immunity to your opponent's activated effects when you have five or more materials, the ability to spin your opponents monsters at the cost of two materials (which is a Quick Effect with a Level 1 Purrely monster attached as a material). Often, Purrelyly will be your start, as it comes with the most benefits despite having both of its effects be once-per-turn. Purrelyly can search for any non-Quick Play Purrely Cards, and 9 times out of 10 you will end up searching either for <strong>My Friend Purrely</strong> or <strong>Stray Purrely Street</strong>. Even though you will use one of these monsters to bring out Expurrely Noir, you will have several ways to bring out other Purrely monsters, since Purrely's effect allows you to excavate the top cards of your deck to add one Purrely Spell/Trap card.&nbsp;</p><p>Another cornerstone piece of the Purrely engine are the Quick-Play Purrely Memories, each of them having the optional effect to special summon a Purrely from your deck monster at the cost of discarding one card. There are four memories with unique main effects as well as an effect when attached to a Purrely Xyz Monster:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Purrely Happy Memory</strong> prevents a card from being destroyed by card effect the first time it is until the end phase after its activation. When attached to a Purrely Xyz Monster, it can allow them to attack +1 Monsters on the field per memory attached (Meaning you can make up to 4 attacks against Monsters with one Purrely Xyz).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Purrely Delicious Memory</strong> prevents a card from being destroyed by battle until the end phase after its activation. When attached to a Purrely Xyz Monster, it will allow that monster to gain 300+ attack and defense points per card attached as a material, including itself. An Expurrely Noir with 5 materials will gain 1500 attack and defense if it has Delicious Memory as a material, giving it a defense of 4300. This card is limited in TCG format, so sadly your dream of 900+ attack/defense per material remains as only a dream.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Purrely Pretty Memory</strong> gives both you and your opponent 1000 LP. However, if this card is attached to a Purrely Xyz, they get the ability to send one card you control to the GY to target one card your opponent controls and attach as material. This is once per turn but does stack with the materials attached to it meaning you can attach up to three cards per turn if you have all three Pretty Memories attached.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Purrely Sleepy Memory</strong> makes it so that the first time you would take LP damage after this card was activated turn to 0. When attached to a Purrely Xyz Monster, it gains the effect of allowing you to draw one card on your opponent stand-by phase. Much like Pretty Memory, this effect stacks with the number of memories attached. As of January 2024, this card is semi-limited.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>My Friend Purrely</strong>, which will be abbreviated as <strong>M.F. Purrely</strong> for short, helps get you either Purrely Sleepy Memory or Purrely Delicious Memory. By paying the low, low cost of 500 LP, you can search 3 Purrely cards and add one at random. You will want to aim for either of these two Quick-Play spells (If you activate M.F. Purrely with neither in hand, search for two Sleepy Memories and a Delicious Memory). In addition, another card you want to coincide with M.F. Purrely is <strong>Stray Purrely Street</strong>, which has three main effects; Attaching a Memory Quick-Play Spell from Deck/GY, preventing Purrely monsters from being targeted by opponent card effects the turn they are summoned, and to create insurance when a Purrely Xyz Monster is removed from field by an opponent's card (This includes destruction by battle or effect, tribute, banish, or bounce/spin). M.F. Purrely also has an insurance policy when it is on the field and your Purrely Xyz is removed from the field. Both work in tandem and will not miss timing, since they are an ""if"" effect:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Stray Purrely Street (CL1): Special Summons a Purrely monster from Deck or GY.&nbsp;</li><li>M.F. Purrely (CL2): Add up to three (3) Purrely Quick-Play Spells with different names from your GY to hand.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>To reach your end goal of that sweet, sweet Towers, Expurrely Noir requires any Rank 2 Monster with 5+ Materials attached to it. This works with any Rank 2, but Purrely Xyz Monsters will give you the easiest time, since you can stack memories/materials on them like pancakes. Each has an effect that allows you to attach a Memory as a material when it activates up to three times per turn, then activate a unique effect upon attaching as a material (NOTE: This is a when effect, cards like Ash Blossom can cause a mistime). The Rank 2 Purrely monsters all require two Level 2 monsters as materials but can be ""cheated"" out with the effects of the <em>Purly Brothe rs</em>. Each of the Purrely monsters will special summon a Rank 2 Purrely Xyz Monster using a Memory Quick-Play Spell mentioned by that respected monster, with each <em>Purly Broth er </em>having its own way of summoning. Purrely requires you to reveal a memory in hand after activation (Soft once-per-turn), while Purrelyly requires you to target a memory in the GY (Hard once-per-turn). Your Rank 2 Purrely Xyz Monsters corresponds to a respected memory and include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Epurrely Happiness (Happy Memory)</strong> (2000 Atk, 100 Def), which can bounce a Spell/Trap on the field when a memory is attached. If it attacks, it can add a Purrely card from deck to hand and, if it has Purrely Happy Memory, you can halve the attack of a monster on the field.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Epurrely Beauty (Pretty Memory)</strong>&nbsp;(1600 Atk, 1100 Def), which can change the position of a monster on the field when a memory is attached. It can negate the effects of a monster on the field. This effect is nice, but it becomes a Quick Effect with Purrely Pretty Memory attached as a material.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Epurrely Plump (Delicious Memory)</strong>&nbsp;(200 Atk, 2100 Def), which can banish a monster from the field when a memory is attached. In addition, you can attach up to two Spells/Traps in either GY as materials once per turn, with this being a Quick Effect when Purrely Delicious Memory attached as a material.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Epurrely Noir (Sleepy Memory)</strong>&nbsp;(1000 Atk, 2000 Def), which can set a Purrely Trap on the field when a memory is attached. Also, you can bounce a card back to hand at the cost of discarding a card, with the amount of bounces being boosted to two if Purrely Sleepy Memory is attached as a material.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Since each Rank 2 will already have two materials, getting another three materials is easy with the number of Memories that fill up your deck. Summoning more Purrely monsters as well as using the effects of M.F. Purrely and Stray Purrely Street can help fill up your Purrely with loving care quickly if you know what you are doing. However, the two best routes (With an alternate third one for a possible OTK) for getting Expurrely Noir out are as follows.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3>1. Epurrely Noir (The ""I Draw 4 On Stand-by Phase"" Approach)&nbsp;</h3><p>The easiest way, and most beneficial way, that you can get to Expurrely Noir, resulting in your <strong>Purrelyeap!?</strong> trap (which will target and rank up/down your Purrely Xyz Monster) to bring out Expurrely Noir on your opponent's Standby Phase. For this, you need a few things:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Purrely/Purrelyly on the field.&nbsp;</li><li>My Friend Purrely, searching to add Sleepy Memory.&nbsp;</li><li>Stray Purrely Street, to ensure you can get 4 materials on your Xyz before the next Standby Phase&nbsp;</li><li>One (or more) additional memories to use Epurrely Noir and set one Purrelyeap!?. Bonus if you add Purrely Sharely!? to your decklist, which will target a Rank 2 Purrely Xyz you control and Special Summon a Purrely monster before ranking it into Rank 2 Purrely Xyz and attaching a material from deck based on the materials attached to your targeted monster.&nbsp;</li></ul><ol><li>Bring out Purrelyly or Purrely (Preferably Special Summon Purrelyly, especially if you have Stray Purrely Street on the field, otherwise Normal Summon Purrely), add either your Field Spell (if not already on the field) or M.F. Purrely. Use this to get the correct memory, or an additional Sleepy/Other memory, preferably Pretty or Delicious. The best way to get more memories, if you have already used the effect of M.F. Purrely, is to special summon more Purrelys, which can excavate to add those memories to hand.&nbsp;</li><li>Special Summon Epurrely Noir.&nbsp;</li><li>Attach as many materials to Epurrely Noir as you can, but you will want to aim to set one Purrelyeap!? with its effect and, if you have it in your deck, Purrely Sharely!?. At the bare minimum, you will want Epurrely Noir with four materials before your turn actually ends.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have enough, or cannot do any more than four memories, end your turn. If you have five materials, go into Expurrely Noir. During End Phase, Stray Purrely Street can be used to target your Purrely Xyz Monster to attach either:&nbsp;<ol><li>Purrely Sleepy Memory #2, if not attached already.&nbsp;</li><li>Purrely Delicious Memory, to bulk up your E(x)purrely Noir&nbsp;</li><li>Purrely Pretty Memory, if you have both, as well as Sharely!? set.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>On your opponent's Standby Phase, use the effect of Sleepy attached to your Xyz. If you have both Sleepy Memories, draw one in one chain. However, if you want Expurrely Noir, on the second draw, activate Sleepy Memory as CL1, then Purrelyeap!? as CL2 (If you have Sharely!? set, activate it as CL3 to bring out Purrelyly and instantly rank up into Epurrely Beauty with Pretty Memory). After doing so, you can activate Expurrely Noir's effects with both Sleepy Memories to draw twice again (Now you see why Purrely Sleepy Memory is semi-limited).&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The big downside to this approach is that Expurrely Noir will be returned to the deck at the end of the turn after it was summoned with Purrelyeap!?. This card is very risky if you cannot find a way to beat down your opponent or get another Expurrely Noir on the field, which is why it is highly recommended to get AA-ZEUS in your Extra Deck, as Expurrely Noir can just rank up into AA-ZEUS with a lot of materials attached.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Epurrely Plump (The Instant Expurrely Towers Approach)&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Epurrely Plump is harder to get out, as Delicious Memory is limited in the TCG format (OCG gets lucky, it's only semi-limited there). You will want to aim to get Plump out, since Plump will eat any Spell/Trap in your GY alongside any Memories attached as a material. For this you will want:&nbsp;</li><li>Purrely/Purrelyly on the field.&nbsp;</li><li>My Friend Purrely, searching to add Delicious Memory or other memories.&nbsp;</li><li>Up to two Spell/Traps in either GY.&nbsp;</li></ul><ol><li>Bring out Purrelyly or Purrely (Preferably Special Summon Purrelyly, especially if you have Stray Purrely Street on the field, otherwise Normal Summon Purrely), add either your Field Spell (if not already on the field) or M.F. Purrely. Use this to get the correct memory, or another memory if you have Delicious already in hand, preferably Pretty or Sleepy.&nbsp;</li><li>Special Summon Epurrely Plump.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have not done so already, use your memories to bring out more Purrely monsters and pitch some spells/traps that you might not use. If Plump is on the field. In addition, if you have two Spells/Traps in your GY, you can attach them as material with Plump's Quick Effect.&nbsp;</li><li>If all has succeeded, your Plump should be stuffed with materials, meaning you can go straight into Expurrely Noir. You do not need to end here, since I would highly recommend getting yourself a second dog, Epurrely Beauty.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The more materials you can get on Plump, the better. Expurrely Noir, alongside being a tower, can spin a card to the bottom of the deck, which is heavily useful when it still has 5+ Materials.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Epurrely Happiness Beatdown (AKA: The Alternate Win-Con)&nbsp;</h3><p>Epurrely Happiness' effects are very much grounds of ""Purrely Beatdown"" if you're going second. When taking Purrely to tournaments, there have been cases which this proved to be viable (One of my favorite moments was when my Expurrely got tributed for Kurikara only to be beaten down moments later). This set up is the easiest, but hardest to rely on:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Purrely/Purrelyly&nbsp;</li><li>Purrely Happy Memory and Purrely Delicious Memory (You can add Delicious with Epurrely Happiness' effect, but you need its effect to prevent a monster your opponent controls from being destroyed by battle)&nbsp;</li><li>If you have neither, you will need M.F. Purrely and (possibly) Stray Purrely Street.&nbsp;</li></ul><ol><li>Bring out Purrelyly or Purrely (Preferably Special Summon Purrelyly, especially if you have Stray Purrely Street on the field, otherwise Normal Summon Purrely). If you do not have Happy Memory already, you will need to get one as soon as possible alongside Delicious Memory.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have everything set, bring out Epurrely Happiness. If you have it in hand already, use Purrely Delicious Memory to both attach on Epurrely Happiness as a material and choose the weakest attack position monster on your opponent's side of the field to be immune from destruction by battle.&nbsp;</li><li>If Epurrely Happiness can beat down a monster, do so. Its effect will allow you to not only half the attack of an opposing monster but also add a Purrely card from deck. For this, add another Happy Memory. Epurrely Happiness, with three Purrely Happy Memories, can attack up to four times on a single monster, halving its attack on each strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Often times, you won't even need to go into Expurrely Noir, as you will most likely bring the LP of your opponent down to zero at this moment, depending on how strong you get Epurrely Happiness to be. However, in the event that your opponent is hanging on by a thread, you can go into Expurrely Noir immediately after you enter Main Phase 2. If you understood that Epurrely Happiness can add any card, you can also add an additional essential card for Purrely, such as Stray Purrely Street so that Expurrely Noir can get another material on End Phase.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h2>Additional Cards (More toys for your kitties to play with)&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>When considering how Purrely spams several Level 1 monsters frequently, <strong>Sylvan Princessprite</strong> is a Rank 1 that can be easily brought out with Purrely. If you spam memories to bring out Purrelys to excavate, you can go into Sylvan and use its effect to excavate the top card of your deck if it is a Spell or Trap Card. You will rarely whiff on this if your deck primarily focuses on Spell cards.<strong> Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</strong> also serves as an alternative Rank 1 approach, which can be used to attack directly and go into <strong>AA-ZEUS</strong>, which can be useful against King Calamity-locking decks like Centurion.&nbsp;</li><li>Two Link Monsters that work well with the Level 1-centric Purrely deck are <strong>Relinquished Anima</strong> and <strong>Linkurboh</strong>. Anima is a going second tool for players who forget about column plays. Since Purrely spams Level 1 monsters frequently, you often end up with 2-3 Purrely monsters on the board. Since Anima requires a Level 1 monster, you can easily put this in a Link zone conveniently adjacent to a monster your opponent controls and relies on. This pairs well if you have a Purrely Xyz that has Pretty Memory, as you can send one (either the newly attached Monster or Anima) to get rid of another monster your opponent controls. Linkuriboh is not necessary for this deck but has its uses when you feel like your end board needs the effect to set a monster's attack to 0.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sky Striker Ace - Azalea</strong> and <strong>Protector of the Agents - Moon</strong> are there to prevent flood gates, with PotA - Moon useful for floodgates like Skill Drain or the (now limited) Gozen/TCBOO/Rivalry (As a Light-Fairy Link, you can use its effect to tribute itself to the GY for cost and destroy one other card your opponent controls. Azalea is quite easy to summon, since Purrely is an archetype of both Light and Dark main deck monsters you can easily summon.&nbsp;</li><li>There are several opportunities in this deck to use your Rank 1 and 2 Xyz Monsters, and even your Rank 7 Towers, to go into <strong>Downerd Magician</strong> and <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS</strong>. It is not always important to do so, but it's a bargaining chip you can use so that your opponent has a target to go after instead of Expurrely Noir.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Droll and Lock Bird</strong> can be really useful as a Level 1 monster. Oh, it's also a hand trap, I guess. If you somehow need to rank up into a monster that needs a Level 1, Droll and Lock Bird can be summoned. If you really want to, you can prevent your opponent from adding cards to the deck after they add something. Run some Droll and Lock Birds in the main deck to help with having some Level 1/Hand Trap consistencies.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Time Thief Hack</strong> is an odd choice, but it is a useful replacement for Purrely Delicious Memory #2 and #3. It is not necessary to run, but it has its uses: Being able to allow your Xyz Monsters to both gain 300+ Attack/Defense per material and, if holding a material that was from the opponent's deck, attack directly.&nbsp;</li><li>Purrely works well with some floodgates, including <strong>Grave of the Super Ancient Organism</strong> and <strong>Rivalry of Warlords</strong>. <strong>Summon Limit</strong> has its periodic uses on Game 2/3 when going first, especially after you have set up your necessary board, but be sure you are careful when using this card. You can unintentionally mess your work up when Summon Limit prevents you from going into Expurrely Noir. Of course, you can get rid of it with Pretty Memory.</li></ul><hr /><p>This is obviously not the ideal Purrely deck, but it has seen a lot of results in the past against other decks. I have had a lot of fun finding ways to modify and craft this deck. This is based on other Purrely decks I have seen being used on both YGOPro as well as some other decks I have faced. Other cards you can consider for side deck include <strong>Nibiru the Primal Being</strong>/<strong>Kaiju</strong> (<strong>Gameciel</strong> or others) or <strong>Herald of the Abyss</strong>. Some other (sometimes pricier) options include <strong>I:P Masquerena</strong> with <strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>, <strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong>, and <strong>Super Starslayer TY-PHON</strong>.&nbsp;</p>"

Light Stage + Dark Room + Exchange,"<p>Greetings! In this deck, you will have fun while giving your opponent nightmares. Let me explain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsCvOK_T-_M"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, play ""Chain Summoning"" to gain two more Normal Summons. Fortunately, you can decide how to do...</p><ul><li>Librarian / Panda / Ravenous / Ancient / Mist / Shamisen / BLS / Saryuja / Any Spell &gt;&gt;&gt; Reload/Acquisitiveness &gt;&gt;&gt; CS</li><li>Any Spell &gt;&gt;&gt; Ravenous &gt;&gt;&gt; CS</li><li>Integrator &gt;&gt;&gt; Trisukta &gt;&gt;&gt; CS</li><li>Librarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Formula/Martial/Integrator/Trisukta/Ravenous/Mist &gt;&gt;&gt; CS</li></ul><p>2) If your opponent doesn't have any cards in their hands, which is possible if you go second, Synchro Summon Mist by using Ancient + Non-Tuner + Tuner as materials. Then, return at least one Main Deck Monster or Spell/Trap to their hand and unlock ""Exchange"" loop, of which I'm going to explain later. Otherwise, Synchro Summon Ravenous with either same materials like before or Ancient + Formula.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Black Luster Soldier (BLS) with his ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Meanwhile, send one copy of ""Primal Seed"" to Banish Zone (BZ).</p><p>4) With Saryuja + Chain Summoning, bring forth 3 x Lycoris. If you must, spare one Main Monster Zone (MMZ) for 3rd Lycoris by banishing a monster you have in MMZ with BLS.</p><p>5) While holding 1 x Primal Seed + 2 x Exchange, and perhaps not holding any Quick-Play spells for safety, activate Light Stage + 3 x Dark Room. Then, play Exchange...</p><ul><li>If your opponent is actually smart, they might try stealing either ""Primal Seed"" or ""Exchange"" to stop the combo. As if it will happen...<ul><li>If they take ""Primal Seed"", you can take ""Primal Seed"" back with 2nd copy of ""Exchange"" you have. Then, you can fetch both Exchange cards in BZ with ""Primal Seed"" by targeting 1st copy of ""Primal Seed"" and 1st copy of ""Exchange"". You have to repeat this step again, which is what I meant with ""Exchange"" loop.</li><li>If they take ""Exchange"", similar to above, you can fetch ""Exchange"" with ""Primal Seed"" loop. There, you can take stolen copy of ""Exchange"" back and even if they steal ""Primal Seed"", you can take stolen copy of ""Primal Seed"" back. This is actually same loop like above but with different order of events.</li></ul></li></ul><p>6) With ""Exchange"" being played, you have given your opponent a card, which triggers Lycoris + Light Stage + Dark Room to deal enormous damage...</p><ul><li>While 3 x Dark Room cards are resolving, you would actually go up to Chain Link as 18. Once for each from 3 x Lycoris + Three times in total from Light Stage thanks to 3 x Lycoris, that's why. 1 x Dark Room deals damage 6 times, which is Chain Link as 6. Thus, 3 x Dark Room would end up with Chain Link as 18.</li><li>However, Master Duel has a Chain Link limit. If you try to go beyond Chain Link 16, first 16 of them will happen in one big Chain Link. Then, the rest will go on as new series of Chain Link.</li></ul><p>7) Repeat these steps explained in #5 + #6 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Mannadium Trisukta"" can be found within ""Indomitable Pride"" Timed Pack to save 30 SR! Don't miss out before it's too late!</p><p>- ""Trickstar Lycoris"" + ""Trickstar Light Stage"" can be found within ""Essence of Flora and Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Exchange"" + ""Mist Wurm"" + ""Dark Room of Nightmare"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 240 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 870 SR and 180 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

And surprisingly... in Theme Chronicle this is an entirely playable strategy! Not the best thing you could be playing, but one that can grind it out with the best and get you the wins for those sweet, sweet gems.</p><p>This decklist is an altered version of one I actually encountered in the event, so I cannot take credit for making this. I will, however, explain the deck to the best of my ability to hopefully make it easier to learn. It's not an especially difficult deck, but information can help you understand how to build your own version and thus be able to improve upon it should you choose to do so.</p><p>The deck is comprised of about two engines made up of three archetypes, the Atlantean+Deep Sea providing Synchro plays and material, while the Icejade cards provide further material and a control tool in Icejade Erosion. It's relatively consistent to get into something across the deck, as both engines net you at least one disruption if you don't get interrupted and decent follow-up for next turn.</p><h2 id=""mcetoc_1hkcoljvh4"">Icejade</h2><ul><li>2x Icejade Aegirine searches any Icejade Spell/Trap on summon, and then revives a WATER if your opponent targets her in any way. The exact target for her search depends on the game state, though I usually favor Erosion if I opened Aegirine with no other relevant cards in hand.</li><li>2x Icejade Tremora allows us effectively free Special Summons of WATER monsters from our hand, just generically useful. If an Icejade is destroyed (including by your own cards) while Tremora's in the GY, she can also banish herself to summon an Icejade from hand or GY.</li><li>2x Icejade Ran Aegirine is an excellent last support card for Icejade, as is still extremely good here. Discarding a WATER (which triggers the Atlanteans, more on that later) allows you to summon her plus an Icejade token. This token locks you into WATER while its on the field, but the material allows you to make a WATER Level 10 Synchro (though they're banned in this event, so no Aegirine Gymir or Chengying for us here) or a WATER Link-2 (Abyssalacia or Coral Anemone, probably).&nbsp;</li><li>1x Icejade Creation Kingfisher is a method of removal and a bit of extra extension if we need it. Entirely removable if you so desire, but being able to bounce an opponent's card back to hand is useful enough that I keep it around.</li><li>2x Icejade Cradle searches any Icejade monster. Not a once per turn, either.</li><li>1x Icejade Manifestation allows you either Foolish Burial or Emergency Teleport an Icejade if you control a WATER and your opponent has a monster on field or in grave.</li><li>1x Icejade Erosion is a once per turn repeatable negate of any card on the field for the cost of destroying an Icejade monster you control. And if your opponent gets clever and tries to banish your WATER monsters from field (or shuffles them into hand/deck), Erosion lets you summon an Icejade straight from your deck.</li></ul><h2>Atlantean+Deep Sea</h2><ul><li>2x Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince is a potent card, though not quite a one card starter. He can send an Atlantean from deck to grave as cost (which triggers the effects of Infantry and Dragoon) to search an Atlantean of choice. Usually you send Dragoons to search Heavy Infantry, but occasionally sending Infantry to destroy something can be useful depending on board state.&nbsp;</li><li>1x Atlantean Heavy Infantry grants you a second normal summon for Sea Serpent monsters, and if sent to the GY to activate a WATER monster effect (IE, sent as cost) it destroys a face-up card your opponent controls.</li><li>3x Deep Sea Diva is a classic Tuner, and still a potent one. By Normal Summoning her (not Special Summon), you can summon any level 3 or lower Sea Serpent straight from your deck.&nbsp;</li><li>2x Deep Sea Minstrel is one of our targets for Diva, and more importantly a tool to get rid of handtraps so you can play uncontested. You can discard Minstrel and another WATER (as cost, so Atlanteans are triggered by this, so Dragoons+Minstrel is a very fun opening hand) to look at your opponent's hand and banish one card from it until the end phase.</li><li>1x Guitar Gurnards Duonigis is the other target for Diva. It can double the level of one Level 4 or lower WATER for the turn, allowing access higher level Synchros off just Diva. It also banishes cards from your opponent's deck equal to the number of WATER monsters you control when it was Special Summoned, which is important for Deep Sea Repiteur since it needs your opponent to have banished cards.</li><li>3x Atlantean Dragoons. Send this as cost (for another monster) to search a Sea Serpent, and that's basically it. The on-field effect is not relevant ever, since the Sea Serpents we run have very low attack in the first place.</li><li>2x Deep Sea Aria to search Diva (or another Sea Serpent, but usually Diva), if you can get another WATER into the grave (which is not especially difficult).</li></ul><h2>Non-Engine</h2><ul><li>3x Ash Blossom, 3x Maxx 'C', 2x Called By the Grave, 1x Crossout Designator, 2x Infinite Impermanence. Handtraps and anti-handtraps, these are generically useful and all legal in this event. I'd be running these in any deck I'd run for this deck.</li><li>1x One for One to summon Neptabyss for the cost of a discard. Note that it cannot activate the effects of the Atlanteans, since One for One is not a WATER monster.</li><li>3x Synchro Overtake. By revealing Deep Sea Repiteur, you can either add Diva to your hand or Special Summon her. Diva's effect only activates when she is Normal Summoned, so you may just want to add her to your hand and normal her.</li><li>1x Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord. If you have exactly 5 WATER monsters in your grave, you can SS it from your hand, and then forcibly discard two random cards from your opponent's hand. The only weakness is that if it is removed from the field, you skip the Battle Phase of your next turn. This can be prove annoying, but the card itself is potent enough to be worth the downside.</li></ul><h2>Extra Deck (only one copy of each card, I generally haven't found too much need for extra copies of anything)</h2><ul><li>Tatsunoko allows one to Synchro Summon using cards in your hand as material, allowing you to turn an otherwise off-line Icejade Tremora into a Level 8 Synchro (or any other combination to make a Synchro with a Level 3 Tuner, use your imagination). You can make this with Deep Sea Diva+Neptabyss.</li><li>Herald of the Arc Light is an omni-negate+minor floodgate, made using Diva+Infantry if you so desire. The GY effect does not have any use in this deck, as we don't play any Rituals.</li><li>Deep Sea Repiteur is required for Synchro Overtake to function, and is fairly functional regardless. While her on-field effect is mostly irrelevant even in this lower powered format, her effect when sent to the GY is just a straight Monster Reborn for Level 5+ WATER monsters, though you're locked into WATER for the rest of the turn afterward.</li><li>Coral Dragon, a classic bit of removal for Synchro decks and one easily made with Diva+Dragoons. Discard (which does count for the Atlantean cards' effect when discarded) to destroy a card on field. And if it gets sent to the GY, you even get a draw.</li><li>Deep Sea Prima Donna is a surprisingly strong card, one that is basically limited by the rest of WATER decks not being strong enough to really leverage its power. Put a banished card back into your opponent's hand to summon any Level 4 or below WATER monster from your deck (or add it your hand). Make this using Diva+Guitar (by using Guitar's effect on Diva). When she's sent to the GY, she'll even shuffle any banished card back to the deck (including whatever you banished with Minstrel's effect, if you so desire).&nbsp;</li><li>White Aura Whale is one of our two main bosses (at least, ones you'll realistically summon), and is our offensive tool for getting inton a game winning state. On summon it's basically Lightning Storm's anti-monster effect, and it can attack twice on monsters while inflicting piercing battle damage. If it ends up destroyed, you can banish another WATER from your GY to revive it as a Tuner, which is not a once per turn.</li><li>Adamanicpator Risen - Dragite is our other boss monster, and our defensive tool going first. If you have a WATER in grave, you can negate a Spell/Trap every turn. The other effect is useless in this deck, since we run no other Rocks. Both this card and White Aura Whale can be made by Diva+Guitar (using Guitar effect on itself to make it a 6), or with Prima Donna+Neptabyss.</li><li>I:P Masquerena is a generic Link-2 you can go into if you have to for whatever reason. I haven't had it as part of an end-board yet, nor do I find opportunities where I wouldn't rather make something else, but it works and we do not have a lot of good alternatives.</li><li>Mistar Boy is just WATER support to help boost our damage. It's generally a struggle to OTK, so we'll take as much help as we can get. Also grabs a WATER and adds to hand when destroyed by your opponent, which is helpful.</li><li>Mermail Abysslacia is a back-up plan, and a generically solid Link-2 for the deck. Her effect to search a Mermail is not applicable to this deck, as we do not have main-deck Mermails (none fit especially well, though Abyssdine, Abyssteua, and/or Abysspike might be generically good enough to consider), but her effect when the opponent destroys her is a solid advantage generator by allowing you to both Foolish Burial a WATER (for cost) then revive a WATER of your choice. Since you rarely get OTK'd in this format (in my experience), you can use this to sit on if you can get two monsters onto the field (that are Fish/Sea Serpent/Aqua) and maybe be able to follow up next turn.</li><li>Knightmare Phoenix is generic Spell/Trap removal that's easily made.</li><li>Marincess Coral Anemone revives a WATER that's below 1500 ATK. Easy to make, and helps push damage in general.</li><li>Knightmare Unicorn is easily made removal for anything that has an effect when destroyed (or can't be destroyed), since it shuffles the target back into deck.</li><li>Knightmare Gryphon I have never made and probably won't ever make. It's a lot of investment for a psuedo-Skill Drain, and we're generally better off with other tools most of the time.</li><li>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax is in a similar boat. I just slotted him in because there's little else to put in. Avramax made with I:P probably isn't outable by most decks, though, so you can definitely get some benefit if you need to.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Let me know if a more in depth guide is wanted, I really think this deck has potential to be a solid option.</p><p>There are many lines but your full max power combo is, Ostinato send Sonata and Soprano (even if both Sopranos are in hand Ostinato allows you to use cards from hand), fusion summon Bacha, Effect of Bacha to summon Refrain (zone placement matters in this deck as our link Bloom requires her bottom left and bottom right zones be empty to work so place Bacha and Refrain right underneath the Extra Monster Zones and then other Special Summons away from whatever zones you will use for Bloom, anyway), Effect of Refrain to add Couplet, Effect of Couplet when added to hand to special summon Soprano in the far left or far right zone, Effect of Soprano to add Sonata to hand, Couplet in pendelum zone, Effect of Couplet to add Concerto, special summon Sonata, Link Refrain and Sonata into Bloom (place her where she has 2 available zones to summon to),&nbsp; Effect of Bloom discarding any card that is not the Concerto we added, special summon Aria and Elegy, Activate Concerto using Bacha Couplet and Bloom as materials to fusion summon Etoile, Chain Link 1 Bacha to special summon Sonata CL2 and CL3 Refrain and Couplet, Effect of Soprano to fusion summon Schuberta, Effect of Concerto to draw a card.</p><p>Okay so what do we have? We can not be targeted, can not be destroyed by battle, can not be destroyed by card effects, we can spin 3 cards from either grave as a quick effect, we have spin back up to 4 cards to our opponents hand as a quick effect and we have 5 other cards in our hand.</p><p>To a lot of decks, this is a complete blowout as they have no way of clearing our board.&nbsp; To some other decks, they need to summon Zeus to send our cards to grave which we can spin back their XYZs before they can even do it.&nbsp; TY-PHON also allows them to remove one card from our field non targetting which we can also just spin back before they can activate the effect.&nbsp; Dragite can also do it if it reveals a bunch of rocks but yet again we can spin it back before it even activates.&nbsp; The board is essentially a wall that tells your opponent we are going to turn 3 whether you like it or not (unless they Super Poly which then yikes we got a game on our hands)</p><p>Anyway that's it! I hope you enjoyed and try out the deck.&nbsp; Again let me know if you want more combo lines or just discussions on different match ups or an in depth look at ratios and cards included.&nbsp; Thanks for checking out my list!</p><p>-JinxMyLux</p>"

Abyss + Wall + Thunder + Broken + Kristya,"<p>Greetings! This deck is quite an unorthodox one, as we will try to win with ""Last Turn"". Before you all say, yes, I know ""Last Turn"" is banned in MD and so are in TCG/OCG. However, its rulings are really complex and got me intrigued. So, I decided to make it simpler for you and just take the deck as if ""Last Turn"" wasn't banned, where you could play like usual under MD banlist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, play Burning &gt;&gt;&gt; Broken combo. If you play Bamboo Swords in explained order, you can skip your opponent's Main Phase 1. The reason as to why I did is that the opponent's turn can be skipped by jumping right into End Phase, if you activate ""Thunder of Ruler"" in Standby Phase. You see, by omitting Battle Phase right after Main Phase 1, game automatically jumps into End Phase...</p><ul><li>If you still don't believe me, you can look at&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Card_Rulings:Thunder_of_Ruler"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">these</a> <a href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Battle_Step"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pages.</a></strong></li></ul><p>2) XYZ Summon ""Abyss Dweller"" by using 2 x Cthugua as materials. Activate this card when it's your opponent's turn, so that your opponent can't activate anything in GY when ""Last Turn"" has sent your opponent's belongings to GY.</p><p>3) Special Summon Kristya with Saryuja. Then, set all Traps and end your turn. When your opponent's turn begins, do these in order:</p><ol><li>Activate Abyss + Wall in Draw Phase. Wall is needed to adjust your LP, so that you can activate ""Last Turn"", if you set your LP lower than or equal to 1000.</li><li>Remember what I told you in #1? You can activate ""Thunder of Ruler"" in Standby Phase.</li><li>When the game has just hit into End Phase, activate ""Last Turn"" and select Kristya...<ul><li>Everything from both sides except the card you have chosen will be sent to GY, which was covered in #1 in case opponent tries to pull off a dirty trick.</li><li>Then, your opponent tries to Special Summon a monster from their deck in face-up Attack Position and two monsters are going to clash. Battle damage is disregarded, so neither player is going to be hurt. Whichever stands out at End Phase is going to win, otherwise it will be a draw.

Pra quem n&atilde;o entendeu vou tentar explicar melhor, &eacute; natural que os decks principalmente n&atilde;o meta (e nesse caso necessitado de 2 ou mais cartas para de fato combar) venham com um tijolinho na m&atilde;o, pois bem, se voc&ecirc; fizer a proeza de puxar o Kashtira Fenrir (o que n&atilde;o &eacute; t&atilde;o dif&iacute;cil tendo em vista que al&eacute;m dos 3 Kashtira Fenrir voc&ecirc; tamb&eacute;m vai ter 3 Pot of Prosperity, cada um podendo escavar at&eacute; 6 cartas, ent&atilde;o &eacute; bem prov&aacute;vel que voc&ecirc; consiga) voc&ecirc; consegue usar o efeito dele puxando o Kashtira Riseheart, e usando os dois voc&ecirc; faz a Number 76: Harmonizer Gradielle que &eacute; uma literal tower contra decks de fogo (cof cof meta de Fire King), e &oacute;bvio que como todo plano esse tamb&eacute;m &eacute; suscet&iacute;vel a erros, se voc&ecirc; quer certeza jogue de meta calabreso.</p><p>Enfim, partindo para outros pontos cruciais desse deck, pq n&atilde;o 2 Beyond the Pendulum? Se voc&ecirc; combou amegan, n&atilde;o tem mais o que buscar no deck kkkk usa a Exceed the Pendulum e puxe o que voc&ecirc; precisa do extra deck. ""Ai, mas e se eu combei e tomei intera&ccedil;&atilde;o e perdi a Beyond the Pendulum antes de usar?!"" A&iacute; voc&ecirc; chora, porque mesmo com outra dela no extra deck voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o vai ter muito mais o que fazer meu rei, voc&ecirc; j&aacute; vai estar mais pra N&aacute;rnia do que qualquer outra coisa.</p><p>Continuando, nunca, em hip&oacute;tese alguma tire a Performapal Celestial Magician do deck, chegar na GranSolfachord Coolia &eacute; a coisa mais f&aacute;cil do mundo e ela previne que os efeitos dos seus pendulum sejam negados, mesmo que a Harmonizing Magician diga o contr&aacute;rio. (Por isso tamb&eacute;m tem o Supreme King Z-ARC nesse deck, remo&ccedil;&atilde;o de tudo do campo do oponente e um bicho de 4000 de atk kkkkk).</p><p>Solfachord Harmonia, outra coisa que eu recomendo n&atilde;o mexer na quantidade, o que esse campo salva a sua vida quando voc&ecirc; s&oacute; tem a DoSolfachord Cutia e mais algu&eacute;m no campo &eacute; uma brincadeira. Lembre-se sempre que se voc&ecirc; voltar a DoSolfachord Cutia do extra deck para a m&atilde;o, voc&ecirc; n&atilde;o vai precisar procurar ela com a Beyond the Pendulum e vai buscar a Harmonizing Magician no lugar dela, melhorando a efici&ecirc;ncia do seu turno.</p><p>Vou me abster de explicar combos aqui para n&atilde;o fazer essa descri&ccedil;&atilde;o se tornar (mais ainda) uma b&iacute;blia, mas mantenha em mente que (por mais que eu seja apaixonado nesse deck) as Solfachords n&atilde;o s&atilde;o o arqu&eacute;tipo mais forte do jogo, mas conseguem sim lutar de igual contra muita coisa, ent&atilde;o eu recomendo muito treinar, principalmente combos curtos e lembrar sempre que a GranSolfachord Coolia &eacute; um omni negate que normalmente puxa uma ""Ghost Ogre"" com mais de 2000 de atk e ineg&aacute;vel para o campo kkkk.</p><p>Outro ponto importante, como o meta de Fire King j&aacute; &eacute; realidade, pode ser interessante trocar a trap das Solfachords, tirar a Solfachord Musica e colocar a Solfachord Formal , para proteger as suas scales e manter o efeito da GranSolfachord Coolia ativo, ele &eacute; o pilar que sustenta esse deck, sem esse efeito voc&ecirc; at&eacute; consegue ""jogar"", mas com ele ativo voc&ecirc; passa de um deck tentando fazer algo para um deck FAZENDO algo.</p><p>Eu particularmente gosto de rodar o deck com 2 Trap Trick, porque mesmo que a Soul of the Supreme King venha na m&atilde;o, ou j&aacute; esteja morta, voc&ecirc; consegue puxar a Infinite Impermanence direto do deck, aten&ccedil;&atilde;o para o fato de que o efeito dela de limita&ccedil;&atilde;o de traps entra em efeito ap&oacute;s a sua resolu&ccedil;&atilde;o.</p><p>O side deck, bem, isso vai depender do seu meta local ou do meta do meio em que voc&ecirc; joga, essa parte n&atilde;o tem muita regra, ent&atilde;o por favor se aventure testando techs diferentes.</p><p>One for One tamb&eacute;m &eacute; question&aacute;vel o uso, mas ter 4 DoSolfachord Cutia normalmente &eacute; mais uma vantagem do que uma desvantagem, ent&atilde;o &eacute; outro ponto que vale o teste e veja o que se encaixa melhor dentro do teu gosto pessoal.</p><p>""Ah, mas o deck &eacute; muito fr&aacute;gil contra handtrap!"" Sim, n&atilde;o tem muito o que dizer sobre isso al&eacute;m de sim kkkk nenhuma vers&atilde;o dele &eacute; particularmente resiliente contra handtrap, ""Ah, mas n&atilde;o sei quem fez um deck que passa por cima de 5 handtrap, faz 7 nega&ccedil;&otilde;es e mais 10 intera&ccedil;&otilde;es."" Parab&eacute;ns, eu tamb&eacute;m consigo fazer isso se eu puxasse sempre uma m&atilde;o perfeita kkkkk n&atilde;o se enganem com essas promessas de deck perfeito, quando o deck faz tanta coisa assim ele &eacute; meta, n&atilde;o um arqu&eacute;tipo quase esquecido kkkkkk.</p><p>Uma &uacute;ltima coisa, com a presen&ccedil;a do Kashtira Fenrir no deck, se acostume a fazer normal summon da SolSolfachord Gracia , isso vai salvar muito combo seu kkkkk.</p><p>Enfim, as Solfachords se tornaram uma verdadeira paix&atilde;o para mim, elas s&atilde;o muito boas e verdadeiramente muito capazes de resultados bons, bastando apenas paci&ecirc;ncia e muito treino pra entender como a estrat&eacute;gia funciona e como contornar alguns obst&aacute;culos. No mais, &eacute; um deck muito divertido de se jogar e muito tranquilo de pegar o jeito, tamb&eacute;m recomendo fortemente jogar e adaptar tudo ao gosto pessoal de voc&ecirc;s, deck que n&atilde;o &eacute; meta &eacute; al&eacute;m de tudo um reflexo do seu jeito de jogar e pensar, ent&atilde;o por favor, aventure-se um pouco mais meu nobre e minha nobre.</p><p>&Eacute; isso, paz! ^0^</p>"

Soul Drain + Tyrant's Tantrum,"<p>Hey there! Some time ago, I made a&nbsp;<strong><a href=""/deck/349025"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virus Deck,</a>&nbsp;</strong>where I relived the moments of ""Doom Virus Dragon"" and ""Crush Card Virus"". These cards are what Seto Kaiba used in ""Waking the Dragons"" arc in Duel Monsters anime of Yu-Gi-Oh. So, I decided to get serious and unleash their full potential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTf175KW98g"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. Then, Special Summon Fusion Parasite while having another Spellcaster monster present...</p><ul><li>If Parasite is in GY due to Ravenous/Dugares, use ""Monster Reborn"".</li><li>If Parasite is in your hand, use Saryuja.</li></ul><p>2) Fusion Summon The Dark Magicians (TDM) by using Parasite + Spellcaster as materials. Then, either empty your deck and shuffle ""Soul Drain"" + ""Tyrant's Tantrum"" with ""The Humble Sentry"" or arrange your Main Deck in a way that you would draw them for certain with Saryuja, which is possible when you activate Saryuja if you have 4 cards in Main Deck and you can place 3 cards on the bottom of your Main Deck in any order.</p><p>3) Activate TDM to draw these Traps mentioned in #2 and activate them. Since the ability of TDM isn't hard-once per turn, you can reset TDM by destroying with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and reviving with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>4) Since you know how to reset TDM, do the same for ""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"" + ""Crush Card Virus"" + ""Deck Devastation Virus"" by shuffling them with ""The Humble Sentry"" and drawing them afterwards with TDM to activate them. Target TDM for EEV + DDV and Exodia/Idol/Parasite for CCV. All three viruses will be active for three turns to detonate whatever your opponent has.</p><p>5) In case you miss what is going on, let me brief...</p><ul><li><strong>Eradicator Epidemic Virus:&nbsp;</strong>Destroys Spell and Trap cards of your opponent.</li><li><strong>Deck Devastation Virus + Crush Card Virus:&nbsp;</strong>Destroys Monster cards of your opponent. DDV covers &lt;=1500 ATK while CCV covers &gt;=1500 ATK, that's why.</li><li><strong>Soul Drain:&nbsp;</strong>Monsters that are in GY/BZ can't be activated, which is why you had to play DDV + CCV.</li><li><strong>Tyrant's Tantrum:&nbsp;</strong>Your opponent can't activate Spells from anywhere unless they send 1 Spell from Main Deck to GY. However, with ME-PSY-YA, any Spell and Trap cards are going to be delivered to BZ instead of GY. Therefore, your opponent can't use Spells. Shame there is no Trap counterpart of Tantrum, oh well.</li></ul><p>6) Revive beefy monsters with ""Monster Reborn"" and end your turn. Don't forget to set ""Primal Seed"", in case you want to continue the loop for some reason.</p><p>7) With the effects of EEV + DDV + CCV active, your opponent can't play anything because whatever they draw for 3 turns will be destroyed thanks to virus cards. Nor they can activate Monster effects from GY/BZ and Spells from anywhere. Trap is their only option to save but it's very unlikely to find the out. So, they will have nothing but to pass the turn back to you.</p><p>8) Attack the opponent with all you have and victory shall be yours!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have played the tutorial. What a good start to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Deck Devastation Virus"" + ""Eradicator Epidemic Virus"" can be found within ""Rulers of Darkness"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Tyrant's Tantrum"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 660 SR and 180 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

But because they are able to do this so easily, they have restrictions like locking you into Synchros or locking you into DARK Dragon Synchros. Because of that, it is not that easy to make a Red Dragon Archfiend Prediction Princess Deck. Red Dragon Archfiend has 1 Level 9 monster in </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which is a Level 9 DARK Dragon Synchro Monster that requires a Tuner monster and a non-Tuner DARK Dragon Synchro Monster as material. As a Quick Effect, you can target a face-up card your opponent controls and negate its effects until the end of the turn. And if it inflicts battle damage to your opponent, you can target a Tuner in your GY and Special Summon it in Defense Position. Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss is a really good form of interruption and negation as it is a proactive effect rather than a reactive effect which allows you to negate cards on field even if your opponent attempts to Chain Block their activations. Because of this, I really wanted to find a way to get to Abyss, target it with </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">World Legacy Monstrosity </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">to get </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> and another Level 9 out from the Deck, use Abyss and a Level 9 to do the Aggregator line, and then Special Summon back Abyss from GY to use as interruption/protection on the opponent's turn with its effect. There are a couple of ways that we can achieve this: </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">World Legacy Succession</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Nine-Lives Cat</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, or </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Cloudcastle</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. But I just find trying to make Nine-Lives Cat or Cloudcastle in addition to the other things we must do as too much to ask for. We already have a enormous combo line that we have to go through to get to Abyss itself, and we can't really maneuver our way to Cat or Cloudcastle that easily. Succession works best after those two other options, but at the same time, I decided that would be only the case if we manage to draw Succession. Doing it everytime is also a bit much to ask (or that's at least what I figure), so we will bring back Abyss with Succession if we do have the Succession only. Next issue I had to address was the Synchro Material requirements.

That did work, but it required you to draw Diabellstar access in addition to your Red Resonator Predaplant engine because Diabellstar and Jet would get you Abyss while Red Resonator and the Predaplants would get you to Monstrosity through Ib.

You have a couple of bricks in the Deck that you really do not want to draw, and while it is a 2.5-card combo to achieve all of this, you don't really end on anything that has to do with RDA. Do you need to play Tzolkin? I would recommend it because it is difficult to find a way to make both Ib and a DARK Dragon Synchro for Abyss without it.

If anything, it tried to recreate&nbsp;<strong>Brilliant Fusion</strong> while also turning the Deck into a going second OTK strategy. I'm not against it, but the cards that Gem-Knight got really did not help the Deck at all, even if they intended to make the Deck shift towards going second. The Deck would have a rough time trying to break boards with anything in-archetype or in-engine.&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Quartz</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Scatter Fusion</strong> put the Deck into a situation where it would be highly dependent on going second or going through&nbsp;<strong>Black Garden&nbsp;</strong>shenanigans to potentially (hypothetically) FTK. Their new Fusion Monster in&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Lady Rose Diamond</strong> really only is able to do anything on your opponent's turn, and even making it going first for your opponent's turn really doesn't do much, if anything at all, with the effects that it is able to provide. The only card I see having the most potential would be&nbsp;<strong>Brilliant Rose</strong> as it can Summon itself from hand (as opposed to&nbsp;<strong>Crystal Rose</strong> Summoning itself from GY) and can send a Gem-Knight or Melodius from Extra Deck to GY to copy some aspect of the sent mosnter (as opposed to Crystal Rose sending from Deck). Gem-Knight has 1 Level 9 monster in&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Master Diamond</strong> who is a Level 9 EARTH Rock Fusion Monster that requires 3 Gem-Knight monsters as Fusion Material. It gains 100 ATK for each Gem- monster in your GY and as a soft once per turn, it can banish a Level 7 or lower Gem-Knight Fusion Monster from your GY and until the End Phase, Master Diamond's name becomes that monster's name and this effect is replaced with that monster's effects. Addressing the elephant in the room, Master Diamond is an EARTH monster, so we cannot get&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> out from the Deck if we target Master Diamond with&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. And besides, if we did a Monstrosity line for a Rank 9, we won't be able to make use of Master Diamond's effect. Let's try something different today.&nbsp;<strong>Galaxy Queen's Light</strong> is a card that I am very familiar with since my friends used to use it all the time in their Decks when we played together. Can't remember if it was for Trains, Blue-Eyes, or Red-Eyes, but I have had experience seeing this card in action. It targets a Level 7 or higher monster you control to have the Levels of all other face-up monsters you currently control become the current Level of that monster. This card looks crazy in Fortune Lady, but we are going to be using this card to get ourselves 2 Level 9's on the field to go into&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. So, how are we gonna search it? PHHY gave us&nbsp;<strong>Galaxy Photon Dragon</strong> which is a generic Rank 4 that can detach a material to either add or send to GY, a Photon or Galaxy card from Deck. We are very capable of making a Rank 4 in this Deck. To do this, we need a hand of&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Armadillo</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Brilliant Rose</strong>, and a way to get a Gem-Knight Normal Monster onto the field. When it comes to Brilliant Rose, you don't need to open it per say since there are plenty of ways to help us get to where we need to go, but we are going to be using this 3-card combo as an example. Let's say that our way of accessing a Normal Gem-Knight is&nbsp;<strong>Unexpected Dai</strong>. Activate Dai to get&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Tourmaline</strong> from Deck onto the field (I like Tourmaline the best, but it can be any Level 4 Normal Monster Gem-Knight). Normal Gem-Armadillo and activate its effect to search for any Gem-Knight monster you want. Doesn't really matter what you get with this opening hand consisting of Unexpected Dai. Activate Brilliant Rose sending the Gem-Knight you searched to GY to Special Rose from hand. Activate Rose's other effect to send&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Seraphinite</strong> from Extra Deck to GY. Link Tourmaline and Brilliant Rose into&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz</strong>. Phantom Quartz adds another Tourmaline from Deck to hand. You just need to search for a Level 4 Gem-Knight here and Tourmaline is the only one we have in the Deck. Pay 1000 LP with Phantom Quartz to Fusion Summon&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond</strong> by shuffling Tourmaline, the Gem-Knight you discarded, and Brilliant Rose (because it is always treated as a Gem-Knight) into the Deck. Lady Brilliant Diamond uses her effect to send Phantom Quartz to GY to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Gem-Knight Master Diamond</strong> from Extra Deck ignoring its Summoning Conditions. Activate Master Diamond's effect to banish and copy Seraphinite's effect from GY. Now, you have an extra Normal Summon of any monster. Normal Summon that Tourmaline you searched. Now you have 2 Level 4's on field in Gem-Armadillo and Gem-Knight Tourmaline. Xyz them into Galaxy Photon Dragon and detach 1 to search for Galaxy Queen's Light. Activate GQL targeting Master Diamond which turns Lady Brilliant Diamond into your second Level 9 monster. Now, you have Rank 9 access and can make&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>. Aggregator and Herald will be able to add 2 Ritual Monster/Spell cards from Deck to hand. But that doesn't mean that you have enough for your Prediction Princess plays unless you hard drew Bibliomuse. Well, to help out in that aspect, we are playing the second copy of Tarotreith along with 3&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>, so as long as you see at least 1 Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell in your opener, you basically have full Prediction Princess combo right then and there. And even if you don't have Bibliomuse, Underworld Ritual and grab it from Deck and put it onto the field and make its search effect available on your opponent's turn. I don't hate this Deck. Not every single one of my Prediction Princess Decks that focus on a Level 9 EARTH monster have access to a Rank 4 which is a letdown, but it does allow for you to play a pretty cool card in Galaxy Queen's Light in Gem-Knight Prediction Princess specifically. Do I think that this Deck is good? Not really. It is not like Gem-Knight is actually doing anything for you other than forcing you to take alternate routes to get to where you need to go. It is certainly playable and more so than some of my other Prediction Princess variants, but I'd prefer a different brew to this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-1401a245-7fff-ce69-bfaf-ed3e0f0d6dbd""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Traotrei</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotreith</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, and 3 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">.

Branded Fusion is a 1 card Archfiend's Manifestation and thanks to the added power of the other Branded cards, your Summoned Skull will have plenty of backup.

I barely know 'er!,"<p>This variant of Summoned Skull attempts to summon as many different types of Summoned Skull as possible. The synchro and ritual variants will be two of the easier and more useful ones. The synchro is fairly easy to summon using Quick Launch as it is a 1 card Archfiend's Call. My suggestion is to make all your extra deck plays in the first half of your combo, and bring out as much as you can, then, if you either get disrupted or run out of gas, start using the Dogmatika cards to bring out Archfiend's Awakening. Not only will this net you extra bodies, but also disrupt the opponent's extra deck as well, potentially milling crucial combo pieces. White Relic is a decent piece of disruption in this regard, as is Maximus, all the while the different Summoned Skull variants are walling up to float at a moment's notice.</p><p>Branded in High Spirits discards for effect, which is nice to trigger Archfiend Heiress, and the Ecclesias paired with Fallen of Albaz and Rindbrumm enable Chaos Archfiend, an alternate win condition that can attack everything for 4500 ATK each, and if it leaves the field it gets to float into Chaos Angel!</p><p>Other disruptions include Archfiend's Ghastly Glitch for a pop + banish by milling Farfa.</p>"

Then, set Disturbance + Miracle and end your turn but not before changing the button at the lower right corner of the screen to ""ON"". You don't want to miss anything happening, do you?</p><p>2) During your opponent's Standby Phase, activate Miracle to let your opponent draw a card. Then, activate Disturbance and chain into Droll. What will happen is Droll denies for either side to add any card to their hand. Therefore, by shuffling your opponent's hand into deck with Disturbance, they won't be able to draw/add any card afterwards, all thanks to Droll.</p><p>3) If you go first, your opponent has nothing to do but pass the turn back to you. When it's your turn, destroy ""Chicken Game"" if present and Normal Summon Yata-Garasu. Attack the opponent with everything you got. If the opponent is still alive, Yata denies your opponent from drawing any card.</p><p>4) Your opponent is stuck, again. Just keep attacking your opponent until they die.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Daigusto Emeral"" can be found within ""Ties to Mother Nature"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

We are meant to lose life points when our ""monsters"" accept others' relationship with God and are meant to gain life points when the truths of how God gives life is given to us.

This build has nearly gotten into Top 8 at regionals and YCS tournaments, and is still very underrated and unexpected to play against with the current meta.</p><p>This deck has primarily a three card combo lock consisting of Electric Jellyfish, either Ocean Dragon Lord - Kairyu-Shin or Fish Sonar, and Ties of the Brethren to lock your opponent into a single normal summoned monster as well as severely locking their special summoning. This combo also gives you a once-per-turn battle negate and monster destruction alongside the initial lock, allowing for easy damage for game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can also utilize the XYZ Armor engine to create large monsters and various interruptions for your opponent, the Bahamut/Toad combo for negates, and even the Stealth Kragen to help attribute lock your opponent as well. The addition of AA-Zeus and TY-PHON allow for some much needed extra firepower and defensive strategies.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>Admittedly, I have tried to utilize Link Monsters such as Apollousa, I:P and S:P, Accescode, and others, but with the water attribute lock, it made things unnecessarily difficult to keep that same level of control. I would like to try to add additional negates/interruptions for your opponent's counters, so any constructive criticism/feedback is appreciated.</p>"

Next, plant flowers to opposing side with ""Black Garden"". Then, play ""Burning &gt;&gt;&gt; Broken"" combo to skip your opponent's Main Phase 1 with Bamboo Swords.</p><p>2) When you have Panda present besides four other monsters, Link Summon Saryuja with these four. Then, Summon these monsters in this order...</p><ol><li>Special Summon Bistro with Saryuja.</li><li>Tribute Summon Hela by using Saryuja + Panda as materials.</li><li>Normal Summon Wanghu.</li></ol><p>3) Pass Wanghu to opposing side by replacing a flower with ""Mystic Box"" and activate ""Zombie World"". Then, when you have Wattfox in-hand and if you have played ""Into the Void"" beforehand, set all Traps and end your turn but don't forget to change the button at the lower right corner of the screen to ""ON"".</p><p>4) During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate these cards in order...</p><ol><li>Hela &gt;&gt;&gt; Tribute Hela &gt;&gt;&gt; Target Wattfox</li><li>Greed + Yang Zing Unleashed</li></ol><p>5) So, here is what will happen: Hela Special Summons Wattfox by tributing herself. Even though Wattfox wasn't Zombie monster by default, ""Zombie World"" changed the outcome in that regard, which was done in #3. Next, Wanghu destroys Wattfox and your opponent will be heavily restricted. Only thing they can do is Normal Summon and Set stuff. As for Unleashed, you will lock your opponent into Battle Phase after their Main Phase 1 has been skipped, which was done in #1.</p><p>6) You are in Battle Phase and your opponent can only attack Bistro Butcher with whatever they have. By dealing some Battle Damage, you can let your opponent draw lots of cards.

With Wattfox being active, your opponent can't make a big board or use hand-traps. Had it not been the case, during Bistro + Disturbance shenanigans, your opponent would have found a way out and wreck your setup.

Get ""There Can Be Only One"" on the field to limit your opponent's monster types. Utilize cards like ""Solemn Judgment,"" ""Solemn Strike,"" and ""Metaion, the Timelord"" to negate and disrupt your opponent's plays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. **Kaijus and Lava Golem:** If your opponent manages to establish a threatening board, use Kaijus or Lava Golem to tribute their monsters, breaking their setup. This provides an additional layer of disruption and control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. **Draw Power:** Use cards like ""Pot of Duality"" and ""Card of Demise"" to maintain hand advantage and ensure you have the necessary resources to control the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. **Super Polymerization:** Utilize ""Super Polymerization"" to disrupt your opponent's plays by Fusion Summoning powerful monsters using their monsters as materials. This can be a game-changer, especially against decks that heavily rely on specific monster types.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. **Defense Mechanisms:** Include cards like ""Swift Scarecrow,"" ""Waboku,"" and ""Threatening Roar"" to protect yourself from direct attacks and buy time to establish your lockdown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. **Extra Deck Options:** While your lockdown strategy discourages Extra Deck usage, have a few versatile Fusion monsters like ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" or ""Mudragon of the Swamp"" that can be summoned with ""Super Polymerization"" based on the monsters your opponent controls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>**Win Condition:**</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- **Outlast and Chip Away:** The primary win condition is to outlast your opponent by continually disrupting their plays, controlling the field, and preventing them from establishing a threatening board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- **Deck Out:** With cards like ""Pot of Duality,"" ""Card of Demise,"" and minimal special summoning, you may aim to deck your opponent out if the game progresses for an extended period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- **Life Point Advantage:** Over time, as you control the game and your opponent's options, you can secure a life point advantage.

When an opponent's monster declares a direct attack, you can discard Beaufort to negate the attack and negate that monster's effects. While it is on the field, you can Quick Effect target a face-up monster your opponent controls to return both it and Beaufort to the hand. For a counterpart to <strong>Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended</strong>, Beaufort IX is really bad in comparison. If we pretend that Voiceless Voice hadn't released yet, Sauravis is still really good in comparison to Beaufort IX because it can discard itself from hand to negate an activated card or effect that targets a monster you control. This is so much better than Beaufort negating a direct attack and negating the attacking monster's effects. Now, if we factor in Voiceless Voice making Sauravis trivial to Summon, Sauravis is now lightyears above Beaufort IX because it is literally <strong>Solemn Warning </strong>on legs. This is a big difference compared to Beaufort IX bouncing itself and a face-up monster your opponent controls. Also, it is not like Ritual Summoning Beaufort IX is easy either. <strong>Breath of Acclimation</strong> is just the generic Ritual Spell for WIND Ritual Monsters, and it is not like Beaufort is tied in (or will be tied into) an archetype like Sauravis now is. The only way I can conceivably see it being easily Summoned (aside from Drytrons) is <strong>Stars Align Above the Shrine</strong>, the Shinobird Field Spell which Ritual Summons a WIND Ritual Monster from Deck. But you can only use Shinobird Tokens and/or Spirit Monsters you control as Ritual fodder. That means that we need to be playing Spirit Monsters now, which leads us into our next Level 9 monster. <strong>Amaterasu</strong> is a Level 9 LIGHT Fairy Spirit Monster. It cannot be Normal or Special Summoned (BIG RED FLAG) which means that it can only be Tribute Set. During either player's turn when your opponent activates a card or effect that targets Amaterasu while it is face-down, you can change it to face-up Defense Position (on activation, not on resolution) in order to draw 1 card. And if it is flipped face-up, it has a mandatory effect that activates that banishes all other cards on the field. And it returns itself to the hand during the End Phase of the turn it was flipped face-up. Before I get into the card, let's get some rulings correct here. If Amaterasu is targeted by your opponent while face-down, she flips herself face-up in response to the targeting which means she flips herself on activation and draws on resolution. Secondly, because she flips herself face-up on activation of her previous effect, it triggers the mandatory effect to banish the whole field as Chain Link 3 (Chain Link 1 was the targeting and Chain Link 2 is the flip face-up). Dear lord, Amaterasu is a bad card. Like don't get me wrong. <strong>Sakitama</strong> and <strong>Konohanasakuya</strong> make Amaterasu a lot easier (to a degree) to Summon. But the biggest offender is that she needs to be Tribute Set and her effect to banish the whole field is mandatory. If we put this into perspective of a Prediction Princess Deck, we can't target her with Monstrosity because she starts off face-down (not like she could actually get Bibliomuse from Deck when targeted by Monstrosity anyways). Also, she's gonna banish our whole field. So why are we even playing her? Well, it is just a consideration. Going back to Stars Align Above the Shrine, getting 9+ Levels of Spirit Monsters onto the field is a lot to ask for just to Ritual Summon Beaufort IX. Because of that, we are playing a lower Level target to Ritual Summon from Deck: <strong>Shinobaron Shade Peacock</strong> who is just a Level 4. It an Tribute its Ritual Summoned self from field to search for a Spirit Monster and a Ritual Spell from Deck. He's sort of like the Spirit Monster version of <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. So, if we are gonna search for a Spirit Monster, we should at least have a funny target to search which resulted me in deciding on Amaterasu. You could Main Deck <strong>Tsumuha-Kutsunagi the Lord of Swords</strong> over Amaterasu, but we are siding it (for the lols) and it is overall a much easier to Summon card overall and pretty neat. Again, this is a miserable Deck. The only combo that really worked for me is a 4-card combo to get to both Beaufort IX and full Prediction Princess combo: <strong>Stars Align Above the Shrine</strong>, <strong>Aratama</strong>, <strong>Konohanasakuya</strong>, and <strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>. Normal Aratama and use it to search for <strong>Sakitama</strong>. Sakitama effect in hand to immediately Normal Summon itself. Next, you can Special Summon Konohanasakuya from hand since you control a Spirit Monster. Activate Shrine and use its effect to Ritual Summon Beaufort IX from Deck using your whole field. Target it with Monstrosity for <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> and <strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> from Deck. There you go, full Prediction Princess combo. This Deck is awful and it barely works, but it crosses off Beaufort IX and Amaterasu off of my list of Level 9's in the game. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">For the Main Deck monsters: 3 </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotrei</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, 1 </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Tarotreith</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">, and 3 </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and during your End Phase, she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei&rsquo;s End Phase effect. Her Flip Effect Special Summons a Flip Monster from your Deck face-down and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back from the GY face-down if she is Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s effects. 2 </span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;"">Deus-X Krawler</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;""> which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute than it. 1 <strong>Raging Storm Dragon - Beaufort IX</strong>. 2 <strong>Shinobaron Shade Peacock</strong>. 1 <strong>Amaterasu</strong>. 3 <strong>Aratama</strong> which is a Level 4 Spirit Monster that adds a Spirit Monster from Deck to hand on Normal Summon. 2 <strong>Sakitama</strong> which is another Level 4 Spirit Monster which can reveal itself in hand to immediately Normal Summon a Spirit Monster from hand, and if it is Tributed, you can target a Spirit Monster in your GY and add it to your hand. 3 <strong>Konohanasakuya</strong> which, unlike Spirit Monsters normally, cannot be Normal Summoned/Set and must be Special Summoned from hand by controlling a Spirit Monster as an inherent Summon. It still returns itself to the hand during the End Phase and also during the End Phase, you can banish it from your GY to target a Spirit Monster you control to prevent neither player from activating that face-up monster's effects on the field for the rest of the turn. This is supposed to stop the self-bounce during the End Phase effect of Spirit Monsters. You don't really use this effect in this Deck because none of your Spirit Monsters are really sticking around on field, but it is nice to know and it can even keep Amaterasu on field after it has been flipped face-up if you want. </span></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;

If you are, let's take a look!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEtmW6TgGwc"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) Plant no more than three flowers to opposing side with ""Black Garden"". If you got excess, destroy them with Offerings/Baronne. Also, don't forget to destroy Garden with Ancient/Ravenous/Baronne.</p><p>2) Special Summon Banisher with Saryuja and Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. With everything being sent to BZ, Ritual Summon Gustkraken by using another Gustkraken as material with Aquamirror. By doing so, you can shuffle whatever your opponent has in their hand to their Main Deck. You can fetch Gustkraken + Aquamirror with ""Primal Seed"" loop and repeat this step until your opponent has no resources in-hand.</p><p>3) Revive two of these monsters with ""Monster Reborn"", which are Integrator/Martial/Shamisen. Next, XYZ Summon Number 30 by using them as materials and destroy Number 30 with Offerings. Then, return Number 30 + 2 x Level 3 from BZ to GY with Different Dimension, which lets you revive two more Number 30 monsters.</p><p>4) When all three Number 30 monsters are in GY, revive them and pass to opposing side by replacing a flower with ""Mystic Box"". Then, set ""Primal Seed"" + ""Drop Off"" and end your turn.</p><p>5) When it's your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Drop Off"" to discard whatever they drew to BZ. If you must, negate whatever your opponent can activate in response to ""Drop Off"" with Baronne. When it's your opponent's Standby Phase, 3 x Number 30 will explode 3 x 2000 = 6000 damage in total to your opponent's face because they have no XYZ materials to detach and prevent the explosion from happening. What's more interesting is...</p><ul><li>Your opponent can't Special Summon anything, which blocks your opponent's way out with Extra Deck shenanigans to get rid of Number 30 cards.</li><li>Your opponent can't attack with Number 30 cards because they have no XYZ materials.</li></ul><p>6) Your opponent has nothing to do but to pass the turn to you. Just repeat ""Drop Off"" shenanigans explained in #4 + #5 while your opponent is crushed by three big golems. Victory shall be yours!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Drop Off"" + ""Primal Seed"" + ""Number 30"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 150 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Black Garden"" can be found within ""Exquisite Jet-Black Rose"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Evigishki Gustkraken"" can be found within ""Rites of the Mirrorworld"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 270 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Ash is a 1 card combo by itself, while WANTED/Diabellstar + Equip-Spell (except Rondo) also works. I first tried playing 2 Populus in case I draw it, but Populus + Ohime/Prep or One For One still works. I rarely drew Populus and most of the time I had Ohime or Prep to discard Jet Synchron.&nbsp;</p><p>Extra Deck and Side Deck are nowhere near optimal and probably the Main Deck could be improved upon as well (non-engine may not be ideal). Bonfire is an option in the Main Deck as well by cutting 1 WANTED + 1/2 more cards or even maybe by cutting the Diabellstar package. For the Extra Deck, at least 2 Herald and 1 Braver is mandatory. 3rd Herald, ASSD, Zeus, Selene, Accesscode, Almiraj, Rank 1s, Rank3s, Downerd can all be at least considered in my opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to give your advice/recommendations.</p>"
