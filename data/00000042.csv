Gift Exchange+Angel O7+Mask of Restrict+Closed Forest,"<p>(Credit to AceTrainerAJ for his support and decktesting. Much appreciated!)</p><p>Some time ago, I made a full zone block deck with&nbsp;<a href=""/deck/372574"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Kashtira Shangri-Ira.</strong></a> So, I decided to make a new version, where Supreme King Dragon is going to copycat Shangri-Ira and Rainbow Neos. Rather than using HFD and Raigeki, where you might not be able to destroy everything, Rainbow Neos can get rid of everything your opponent has by shuffling everything into their deck. Oh btw, everything is done within 300 sec, so you can do what I was going to explain in Ranked as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wUp_BXiAkg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Cthugua is present and Shamisen is in GY, Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Gale with it. Then, activate Gale twice to send Shangri-Ira + Rainbow Neos from Extra Deck to GY, at the cost of 6000 LP in total.</p><p>2) Place both Predaplants on Pendulum Zones and activate Bufolicula to Fusion Summon Supreme King Dragon by using both Predaplants monsters on Pendulum Zones as materials. Next, activate Supreme King Dragon and target Rainbow Neos in GY to copycat its abilities. There, you can set any spell but combo pieces and send it to GY. This allows you to shuffle all of your opponent's Spells and Traps into their Main Deck.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. As long as you don't banish Shamisen by accident, all is well.</p><p>4) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. Copycat Rainbow Neos for another time with Supreme King Dragon. There, you can send Panda to GY and you can be able to shuffle all of your opponent's monsters into Main/Extra Deck.</p><p>5) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. This time, gain abilities of Shangri-Ira with Supreme King Dragon. Then, Special Summon Shamisen with its ability.</p><p>6) Refill your deck with ""Pot of Avarice"", in addition to fetching some cards from BZ with ""Primal Seed"". Then, set Primal Seed + Gift Exchange and Synchro Summon Salamander by using Cthugua + Shamisen as materials.</p><p>7) Activate Salamander, which puts every card you have back into Main Deck. Then, play ""Gift Exchange"" to start blocking your opponent's zones. You should prioritize targeting your combo pieces to fetch them into your hand with ""Primal Seed"" loop. Here are those:</p><ul><li><strong>Angel O1:&nbsp;</strong>It will be used to reveal Angel O7. There, we can use the ability of O1 to Tribute Summon O7 at the end, by using O1 + Gale as tributes.</li><li><strong>Angel O7:&nbsp;</strong>If Tribute Summoned, Effect Monsters can't activate their effects, wherever they are.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies Field Spells.</li></ul><p>8) When all of your opponent's zones are locked with ""Gift Exchange"" and ""Shangri-Ira"" combinations, activate ""Closed Forest"". Set ""Mask of Restrict"" and Tribute Summon Angel O7. Everything was explained in full detail in #7. Then, set ""Primal Seed"" and end your turn. Also, ME-PSY-YA allows Spells and Traps to be sent to BZ instead of GY. You can consider it as another blocker, since there are little to none of Spells/Traps that can activate from BZ.</p><p>9) During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Mask of Restrict"". Since your opponent has nothing to do, they will pass the turn back to you. Then, attack your opponent directly to win the game:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Rainbow Neos"" can be found within ""Crystal Septenary"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Closed Forest"" can be found within ""Forest Friends"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Lavalval Salamander"" can be found within ""Combatants of Flame"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gift Exchange"" + ""Gale Dogra"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Between 60 card pile Rikka/Aroma/Sylvan I feel like this is the best 40 card version I can currently come up with (totally open to suggestions otherwise)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deck is focused on advantage and recursion. Your main focus of the deck is to get into Sylvan Dancepione as quick as you can to get the excavate highroll. Since most monsters in the deck offer advantage or a way to keep pushing the combo forward it kind of doesn't matter what you hit as long as you hit a single plant at the very least.&nbsp;</p><p>Hitting 3 plants off Dancepione is also completely okay and is most often the absolute best high roll, leading to the best ending board you can make from the sheer advantage you can get.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck also centers around heavily abusing non-HOPT effects, primarily being multiple revivals of Sylvan Hermitree and Aromaseraphy Jasmine/Aromage Jasmine.</p><p>The hand fixing this deck can do is absolutely off the charts in my opinion, you should be getting at the very minimum 2 Hermitree draws and 1 Aromaseraphy Jasmine draw for just doing your end board as you would normally taking all other cards out of the equation.</p><p>Sylvan Charity is absolutely the best card in the deck even in 2024 now but suffers from sequencing conflicts. Example: You want to Charity first to fix your hand but once you continue that sequence into making Dancepione; you learn you would have benefitted more from holding Charity and taking the gamble on making Dancepione first. But that is why I call this deck&nbsp;<strong>Highroll.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, you will see 90% of your cards with any given hand with how many 1/2 card starters there are- compiled with the raw advantage from multiple draws (3+) and searches (Humid Winds, Mardel, Sweet Marjoram, Aromalylith Rosemary).</p><p>The most common end board i've managed to land on with this deck with any given hand would look something like:</p><p><strong>Benghalancer </strong>(1 Bounce, LP loss is irrelevant), <strong>Aromalylith Magnolia</strong> (Board Protection fusion+ATK boost), <strong>Aromage Sweet Marjoram</strong> (OPT destroy a card on Life-gain), T<strong>eardrop the Rikka Queen</strong> (Quick effect tribute an opponents monster), and usually at least 2 of the 3<strong> Dried Winds , Humid Winds , Blessed Winds </strong>(Usually you will draw one or two throughout the combo, and search the outlier from Sweet Marjoram if you placed anything other than Humid Winds face up off Aroma Blend)</p><p>Thanks for reading, hope you give it a try. If you're interested in a 60 card build honestly throw in the Rikka core and Sunavalon/Therion stuff and mess around as you see fit but I found it didn't help this specific build as it really skews the RNG from Dancepione with that much variance (though summoning Petal or Mudan from Dancepione is pretty sick)</p>"

Then you use Nunus Gy effect to revive itself before then tribute it using Daybreak giving you 2 tokens and getting it off the board so you don't get reptile locked. Then you use the tokens and Nauya to either make the link 3 if you have fuel to use its search effect or a second copy of the link 2 and going into Sunavalon Dryatrentiay and searching bloom so that you can negate your opponents entire board on their turn and setting up a potential otk for your next turn.</p><p>This is the best build I have found after a few days of testing and I am sure with more testing that better builds will be found that possibly focus on supporting a specific deck to boost the power that Raika already has.</p>

Since Alich destroys itself automatically, you can play D.D.R. as many times as you like.</p><p>4) It's time to send Seed Cannons to GY and deal damage. Since Banisher delivers everything to BZ, we have to close Banisher with ""Book of Moon"". Now, 3 x Seed Cannon can be sent to GY to deal 3 x (500 x 5) = 7500 damage in total.</p><p>5) Since the damage isn't enough, we have to try again. Open Banisher with ""Book of Taiyou"" to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop another time. Here, play ""Soul Release"" to banish 1 x Book of Moon + 3 x Seed Cannon. Then, retrieve combo pieces needed with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #3 + #4 + #5 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Turn 1.5 cards -> 6+ negates and follow-up!,"<div>Historically, Superheavy Samurai has been an obscure rogue archetype possessing interesting unique gimmicks found almost nowhere else - gigantic defense position beatsticks attack while in defense position (applying DEF as ATK), the duelist is rewarded/punished for having no spells and traps in GY, and stealing your opponent's backrow to use as your own. However, with the release of Indomitable Pride, Superheavy Samurai has evolved from a simple beatdown deck into a potent combo machine!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Twelve 1.5 card starters, a link-1 monster reborn and a non-once per turn ""ROTA"" grant this strategy incredible ability to create monstrous 3 to multiple negate boards, while having tons of follow-up for next turn! The extreme consistency of this deck's starters also give Superheavy Samurai ridiculous amounts of space for staple cards - allowing for 15+ handtraps to be maindecked!

Arcana + Oracle + Museum,"<p>Welcome! In this deck, we will slowly but surely kill the opponent thanks to ""Dark Snake Syndrome"" without attacking, which is granted by ""Ghostrick Museum"". Let me explain!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YcUxhhpl8pQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, play ""Time-Tearing Morganite"". Then, while ""Light Barrier"" is active, either Special Summon Arcana with Saryuja or Tribute Summon Arcana thanks to Morganite. Choose the outcome as&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to always skip your opponent's turn at the cost of sending two of your monsters to GY, which is guaranteed of 2 x Cockroach Knight cards later on.</p><p>2) Fusion Summon Oracle by using Swirl + Ghost as materials by activating Swirl. Then, if you have played ""Into the Void"" while holding 2 x Cockroach Knight, activate ""Ghostrick Museum"" and 3 x Dark Snake Syndrome. Finally, end your turn but don't forget to send two of any monsters but Oracle + Arcana to GY.</p><p>3) During the first turn, if you haven't noticed, Cockroach Knights were placed on top of the Main Deck. When your turn begins, you will draw two cards instead of one thanks to Morganite and you are going to draw exactly those Cockroach Knights. Since you are able to Normal Summon or Set twice instead of once, you can place Cockroach Knights on the battlefield. When your turn ends, you can send them to GY with Arcana and skip your opponent's turn. With Cockroach Knights being placed on top of the Main Deck, this step can happen as many times as you want or until the opponent is dead.</p><p>4) During the Standby Phase of yours, Dark Snake Syndromes will deal some damage, which will be doubled during each Standby Phases of yours.

Mind you, you have to Link Summon Saryuja when you have 4 cards in Main Deck to draw them all and shuffle back all three ""Coffin Seller"" cards, which is a setup you need to prepare in advance for ""The Dark Magicians"" (TDM).</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. As long as you don't banish Grace/Parasite by accident, everything will be alright.</p><p>4) Fusion Summon TDM by using Parasite + Spellcaster as materials. Activate TDM three times to draw all three ""Coffin Seller"" Trap cards, which can be activated any time. To reset TDM, don't forget to destroy TDM with ""Offerings to the Doomed"" and revive with ""Monster Reborn"".</p><p>5) If 3 x Coffin Seller are active, revive Grace and Alector + Flamvell with ""Monster Reborn"". Then, Synchro Summon Trident by using Alector + Flamvell as materials.</p><p>6) Start by sending your opponent's monsters from Main/Extra Deck to GY with Grace/Trident. Each time you do it, you deal 300 x 3 = 900 damage in total, thanks to ""Coffin Seller"" cards. Since Grace/Trident aren't hard once per turn, you can reset them with Offerings and revive them with Reborn.</p><p>7) Repeat what was explained in #6 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""The Dark Magicians"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Monster Reborn"" is given for free, if you have completed the tutorial to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Fusion Parasite"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

D.D. Designator + Drop-Off,"<p>So, have you heard of infamous Yata-Lock? Ever wondered how to relive but don't know where to start from? Well, you are in luck, as ""Treasure Panda"" can make it happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6xxwuE6STg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Baronne is present, Special Summon Banisher with Saryuja. Then, Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability. Your Primal Seed loop is ready.</p><p>2) Play D.D. Designator until you deplete your opponent's resources in-hand. Then, set ""Drop Off"" to discard whatever your opponent can draw later on. Had ""Time Seal"" not been banned in Master Duel, you would have used ""Temple &gt;&gt;&gt; Time"" combo to send signals of Yata-Lock but it is what it is.</p><p>3) Play Offerings on Baronne. Then, activate D.D.R. on Baronne. This step is needed to not deck-out besides clearing your opponent's stuff one by one, should you go second.</p><p>4) If you have played ""Into the Void"" and holding ""Yata-Garasu"" in-hand, set ""Primal Seed"" and end your turn. On your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Drop Off"". If needed, negate whatever your opponent can activate with Baronne in response to ""Drop Off"", just in case.</p><p>5) When it's your turn, use ""Primal Seed"" to fetch Yata + Offerings. Then, Normal Summon Yata and attack with it to skip your opponent's Draw Phase. If you also want to skip yours, just destroy Yata with Offerings.</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #6 besides attacking with other monsters to win the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Baronne de Fleur"" can be found within ""The Noble Knights of Crimson Flowers"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Ravenous"" + ""Pot of Acquisitiveness"" + ""Drop Off"" + ""Primal Seed"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 90 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Once while this Fusion Summoned card is face-up on the field, you can pay LP in multiples of 2000 and choose to activate up to 3 effects based on every 2000 LP you paid. The first effect allows you to add a Spell/Trap from your GY to your hand. The second effect destroys exactly 3 cards your opponent controls. And the third effect has Coordius gain ATK equal to half the different between your LP and your opponent's LP for this turn only, but your other monsters cannot attack this turn. So, one way that you can Summon Coordius really easily is if you use&nbsp;<strong>Deep Sea Diva</strong> to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince</strong> from Deck. Then, you would Synchro the two of them into&nbsp;<strong>Goyo Defender</strong>. Goyo Defender Special Summons 2 more copies of itself from Extra Deck. Xyz 2 of them into a Rank 3 and then Link that Xyz Monster and the remaining Goyo Defender into a Link-2 Monster. Now, if you have&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong>, you can go ahead and banish a Synchro, Xyz, and Link from field/GY to Fusion Summon Coordius. That works, but we are trying to play Prediction Princess here. We need a way to find&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong>, and have a Synchro, Xyz, and Link to Fuse into Coordius. And that is easily done utilizing the power of&nbsp;<strong>Red Resonator</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong>. And, we are also making use of some of the new Goblin Rider monsters from PHNI to get ourselves into the right position to get our materials for Coordius. Same 2.5-card combo:&nbsp;<strong>Red Resonator</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong>, and a monster to send for Scorpio's effect. Normal Red Resonator who Special Summons Scorpio. Scorpio sends a monster from hand to GY to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra&nbsp;</strong>from Deck who searches for&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong>. Xyz Cobra and Scorpio into the new&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Big-Head Gabonga</strong> who adds a Golin monster from Deck to hand on Xyz Summon. Add&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Dug the Assaulter</strong>. Dug detaches a material from Gabonga to Special Summon itself from hand. Synchro Red Resonator and Dug into&nbsp;<strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong> who adds&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> from Deck to hand on Synchro Summon. Link Gabonga and Ib into&nbsp;<strong>Donner, Dagger Fur Hire</strong>. Activate Miracle Synchro Fusion and banish Ib, Gabonga, and Donner from field/GY to Fusion Summon Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon from Extra Deck. Pay 2000 LP with Coordius to add back Miracle Synchro Fusion from GY. Activate Monstrosity targeting Coordius to get&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Deus-X Krawler</strong> from Deck. Xyz Coordius and Deus-X into&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator&nbsp;</strong>in the EMZ who sends <strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong> from Extra Deck to GY. Herald triggers to add&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> from Deck to hand. Target Herald in GY with Aggregator and detach Deus-X to attach Herald from GY to itself. Link Aggregator into&nbsp;<strong>Gravity Controller</strong>. Herald hits the GY and triggers again to add&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> from Deck to hand. Activate Underworld Ritual to Ritual Summon Tarotrei by Tributing Bibliomuse. Bibliomuse Special Summons herself back from GY face-down. Tarotrei changes Bibliomuse to face-up Attack Position. Bibliomuse's Flip Effect triggers to add&nbsp;<strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith&nbsp;</strong>and another Underworld Ritual from Deck to hand. Activate the Underworld Ritual you just searched to Ritual Summon Tarotreith face-down. Proceed to your End Phase and Tarotrei Special Summons Deus-X from GY face-down. During your opponent's Standby Phase, banish Underworld Ritual from GY as Chain Link 1 and activate Tarotrei's effect as Chain Link 2. Tarotrei changes Tarotreith to face-up Attack Position and Underworld Ritual Special Summons another Bibliomuse from Deck face-down. On a new Chain, Tarotreith's Flip Effect triggers to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Pot of the Forbidden&nbsp;</strong>from Deck face-down. Heading into your opponent's Main Phase, you can activate Tarotreith's effect to flip Bibliomuse, Deus-X, and Pot of the Forbidden face-up. Pot looks at your opponent's hand and shuffles a card from it back into the Deck, Deus-X negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field, and Bibliomuse searches for another Tarotrei and Underworld Ritual for next turn. That's a pretty good board you have. Now, let's look at what we can do on our next turn. We have the second Underworld Ritual in GY that we can use to get another Bibliomuse from Deck. We have the Tarotrei and Underworld Ritual in hand that we searched on our opponent's turn. And we have Miracle Synchro Fusion which is live and able to Fusion Summon another Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon from Extra Deck. Let's talk about that. We can banish Gravity Controller, Mereologic Aggregator, and Herald of the Arc Light from field/GY with Miracle Synchro Fusion to make another Coordius which is really good. So what can the second Coordius do? Well, if your opponent has 3 or more cards on their field, you can choose to pop 3 of them with Coordius and we can also add back the World Legacy Monstrosity in our GY which can target Coordius again to get 2 Level 9's from our Deck to go into&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> who Tributes itself to get&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong> from our Extra Deck and suck up 2 to 3 cards from our opponnent's field depending on if we also Xyz using Coordius. We are never using that 3rd effect because the restriction on your other monsters not attacking is pretty bad if Coordius himself is not game. This is extremely good. I never would've thought that Coordius would be summonable in Prediction Princess and I never figured that it would be this good at setting up your board and setting up an incredible amount of follow-up for your following turn. If anything, I think that this replaces Ib Ham Prediction Princess. It functionally is Ib Ham Prediction Princess, but it has focus on making Coordius which just enables so much more than what Ib Ham Prediction Princess can do. This is functionally one of the best Prediction Princess builds that I have come across and experimented on and it is now my favorite build of Prediction Princess.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For the Main Deck Monsters: 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong>, 1 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>, and 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. Tarotrei can Quick Effect flip a monster on field face-up or face-down and she can Special Summon a Flip Monster from hand or GY face-down during your End Phase. Tarotreith must either be Ritual Summoned or Special Summoned via Tarotrei's effect in the End Phase. Her Flip Effect Special Summons a Flip Monster from your Deck face-downn and she can also Quick Effect flip any number of your monsters face-up or face-down. Bibliomuse can Special Summon herself back face-down after being Tributed and sent there. Her Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess monster other than herself and a Ritual Spell from Deck to hand and while she is face-up on the field, your Ritual Monsters gain targeting and destruction protection from your opponent&rsquo;s card effects. 2 <strong>Deus-X Krawle</strong>r which negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's side of the field after it has been flipped face-up and if it is destroyed on field, you can search for a Level 9 monster with a different Type and Attribute. 1 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden </strong>which has a Flip Effect that lets you choose between Drawing 2 cards, returning all Spell/Traps on the field to the hand, destroying all monsters your opponent controls, or looking at your opponent's hand and shuffling a card from it back into the Deck. 1 <strong>Mardel, Generaider Boss of Light </strong>which is a Level 9 target for Monstrosity in Deck and you can also easily get it onto the field with Lonefire Blossom and on Summon it either searches a Generaider card or a Plant monster. 3&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</strong> which sends a monster from your hand to the GY on Normal or Special Summon to Special Summon a Predaplant monster from your Deck other than itself. 1&nbsp;<strong>Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</strong> which adds a Fusion or Polymerization Spell Card from Deck to hand if it is Special Summoned by the effect of a Predaplant Monster once per Duel. 2&nbsp;<strong>Lonefire Blossom</strong> which Tributes a Plant monster to Special Summon a Plant monster from Deck. 1&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Dug the Assaulter</strong> which is a Level 3 monster we can Special Summon from hand by detaching an Xyz material from a monster on field. We aren't playing any Goblin Rider Spell/Traps, so it is not like we can make use of its other effect. But we just need it for the Summonable Level 3 body. It is not a hard brick since it can Summon itself from your hand, but you'd just prefer not to draw it. 3&nbsp;<strong>Red Resonator&nbsp;</strong>which Special Summons a Level 4 or lower monster from hand on Normal Summon and targets a face-up monster on field on Special Summon to gain Life Points equal to that monster's ATK. 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Resonator Call</strong> which adds a Resonator monster from Deck to hand. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Monstrosity</strong> which either Special Summons&nbsp; Level 9 monster from your hand or targets a Level 9 monster you control to Special Summon 2 Level 9 monsters from your Deck with different Types and Attributes than that monster but with different names. 1&nbsp;<strong>World Legacy Succession</strong> which Special Summons a monster from GY to Linkpoint. 1&nbsp;<strong>Instant Fusion</strong> for&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Miracle Synchro Fusion</strong> which Fusion Summons a Fusion Monster that lits a Synchro Monster as material by banishing monsters from field and/or GY. 3&nbsp;<strong>Underworld Ritual of Prediction</strong> which Ritual Summons a Prediction Princess Ritual Monster from hand or GY face-up or fac-edown and you can banish it from GY during the Standby Phase to Special Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess monster from Deck face-down. Finally, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Trishula, the Dragon of Icy Imprisonment</strong>. 2&nbsp;<strong>Coordius the Triphasic Dealmon</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Master of Ham&nbsp;</strong>which Special Summons a Flip Monster from hand or Deck face-down on Fusion Summon. 1 <strong>Ib the World Chalice Justiciar</strong> which adds a World Legacy card from Deck to hand on Synchro Summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Herald of the Arc Light&nbsp;</strong>which adds a Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell from Deck to hand if sent to GY. 1&nbsp;<strong>Merelogic Aggregator</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Laevateinn, Generaider Boss of Shadows</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Goblin Rider Big-Head Gabonga</strong> which is a Rank 3 Xyz that searches a Goblin monster from Deck on Xyz Summon. That's all that we are using it for, but it can attach a face-up monster on field to itself if a material(s) is detached from a monster(s) on field which can be used as removal perhaps. 1&nbsp;<strong>Donner, Dagger Fur Hire&nbsp;</strong>which is a Link-2 that needs 2 monsters with different Types and can target a Fur Hire you control and a mosnter your opponent controls to destroy them.
