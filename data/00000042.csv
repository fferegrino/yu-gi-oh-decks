Gift Exchange+Angel O7+Mask of Restrict+Closed Forest,"<p>(Credit to AceTrainerAJ for his support and decktesting. Much appreciated!)</p><p>Some time ago, I made a full zone block deck with&nbsp;<a href=""/deck/372574"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Kashtira Shangri-Ira.</strong></a> So, I decided to make a new version, where Supreme King Dragon is going to copycat Shangri-Ira and Rainbow Neos. Rather than using HFD and Raigeki, where you might not be able to destroy everything, Rainbow Neos can get rid of everything your opponent has by shuffling everything into their deck. Oh btw, everything is done within 300 sec, so you can do what I was going to explain in Ranked as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wUp_BXiAkg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Cthugua is present and Shamisen is in GY, Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Gale with it. Then, activate Gale twice to send Shangri-Ira + Rainbow Neos from Extra Deck to GY, at the cost of 6000 LP in total.</p><p>2) Place both Predaplants on Pendulum Zones and activate Bufolicula to Fusion Summon Supreme King Dragon by using both Predaplants monsters on Pendulum Zones as materials. Next, activate Supreme King Dragon and target Rainbow Neos in GY to copycat its abilities. There, you can set any spell but combo pieces and send it to GY. This allows you to shuffle all of your opponent's Spells and Traps into their Main Deck.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. As long as you don't banish Shamisen by accident, all is well.</p><p>4) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. Copycat Rainbow Neos for another time with Supreme King Dragon. There, you can send Panda to GY and you can be able to shuffle all of your opponent's monsters into Main/Extra Deck.</p><p>5) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. This time, gain abilities of Shangri-Ira with Supreme King Dragon. Then, Special Summon Shamisen with its ability.</p><p>6) Refill your deck with ""Pot of Avarice"", in addition to fetching some cards from BZ with ""Primal Seed"". Then, set Primal Seed + Gift Exchange and Synchro Summon Salamander by using Cthugua + Shamisen as materials.</p><p>7) Activate Salamander, which puts every card you have back into Main Deck. Then, play ""Gift Exchange"" to start blocking your opponent's zones. You should prioritize targeting your combo pieces to fetch them into your hand with ""Primal Seed"" loop. Here are those:</p><ul><li><strong>Angel O1:&nbsp;</strong>It will be used to reveal Angel O7. There, we can use the ability of O1 to Tribute Summon O7 at the end, by using O1 + Gale as tributes.</li><li><strong>Angel O7:&nbsp;</strong>If Tribute Summoned, Effect Monsters can't activate their effects, wherever they are.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies Field Spells.</li></ul><p>8) When all of your opponent's zones are locked with ""Gift Exchange"" and ""Shangri-Ira"" combinations, activate ""Closed Forest"". Set ""Mask of Restrict"" and Tribute Summon Angel O7. Everything was explained in full detail in #7. Then, set ""Primal Seed"" and end your turn. Also, ME-PSY-YA allows Spells and Traps to be sent to BZ instead of GY. You can consider it as another blocker, since there are little to none of Spells/Traps that can activate from BZ.</p><p>9) During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Mask of Restrict"". Since your opponent has nothing to do, they will pass the turn back to you. Then, attack your opponent directly to win the game:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Rainbow Neos"" can be found within ""Crystal Septenary"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Closed Forest"" can be found within ""Forest Friends"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Lavalval Salamander"" can be found within ""Combatants of Flame"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gift Exchange"" + ""Gale Dogra"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"
