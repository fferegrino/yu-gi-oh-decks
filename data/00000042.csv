Gift Exchange+Angel O7+Mask of Restrict+Closed Forest,"<p>(Credit to AceTrainerAJ for his support and decktesting. Much appreciated!)</p><p>Some time ago, I made a full zone block deck with&nbsp;<a href=""/deck/372574"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Kashtira Shangri-Ira.</strong></a> So, I decided to make a new version, where Supreme King Dragon is going to copycat Shangri-Ira and Rainbow Neos. Rather than using HFD and Raigeki, where you might not be able to destroy everything, Rainbow Neos can get rid of everything your opponent has by shuffling everything into their deck. Oh btw, everything is done within 300 sec, so you can do what I was going to explain in Ranked as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wUp_BXiAkg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) When Cthugua is present and Shamisen is in GY, Link Summon Saryuja and Special Summon Gale with it. Then, activate Gale twice to send Shangri-Ira + Rainbow Neos from Extra Deck to GY, at the cost of 6000 LP in total.</p><p>2) Place both Predaplants on Pendulum Zones and activate Bufolicula to Fusion Summon Supreme King Dragon by using both Predaplants monsters on Pendulum Zones as materials. Next, activate Supreme King Dragon and target Rainbow Neos in GY to copycat its abilities. There, you can set any spell but combo pieces and send it to GY. This allows you to shuffle all of your opponent's Spells and Traps into their Main Deck.</p><p>3) Place ME-PSY-YA on Pendulum Zone and Special Summon Chaos Emperor Dragon with its ability to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop. As long as you don't banish Shamisen by accident, all is well.</p><p>4) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. Copycat Rainbow Neos for another time with Supreme King Dragon. There, you can send Panda to GY and you can be able to shuffle all of your opponent's monsters into Main/Extra Deck.</p><p>5) Reset Supreme King Dragon with Book spells. This time, gain abilities of Shangri-Ira with Supreme King Dragon. Then, Special Summon Shamisen with its ability.</p><p>6) Refill your deck with ""Pot of Avarice"", in addition to fetching some cards from BZ with ""Primal Seed"". Then, set Primal Seed + Gift Exchange and Synchro Summon Salamander by using Cthugua + Shamisen as materials.</p><p>7) Activate Salamander, which puts every card you have back into Main Deck. Then, play ""Gift Exchange"" to start blocking your opponent's zones. You should prioritize targeting your combo pieces to fetch them into your hand with ""Primal Seed"" loop. Here are those:</p><ul><li><strong>Angel O1:&nbsp;</strong>It will be used to reveal Angel O7. There, we can use the ability of O1 to Tribute Summon O7 at the end, by using O1 + Gale as tributes.</li><li><strong>Angel O7:&nbsp;</strong>If Tribute Summoned, Effect Monsters can't activate their effects, wherever they are.</li><li><strong>Mask of Restrict:&nbsp;</strong>Denies tributing for either sides, which blocks Kaiju-related cards.</li><li><strong>Closed Forest:&nbsp;</strong>Denies Field Spells.</li></ul><p>8) When all of your opponent's zones are locked with ""Gift Exchange"" and ""Shangri-Ira"" combinations, activate ""Closed Forest"". Set ""Mask of Restrict"" and Tribute Summon Angel O7. Everything was explained in full detail in #7. Then, set ""Primal Seed"" and end your turn. Also, ME-PSY-YA allows Spells and Traps to be sent to BZ instead of GY. You can consider it as another blocker, since there are little to none of Spells/Traps that can activate from BZ.</p><p>9) During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate ""Mask of Restrict"". Since your opponent has nothing to do, they will pass the turn back to you. Then, attack your opponent directly to win the game:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom"" can be found within ""Indomitable Knights"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Rainbow Neos"" can be found within ""Crystal Septenary"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Closed Forest"" can be found within ""Forest Friends"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Lavalval Salamander"" can be found within ""Combatants of Flame"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be found within ""Treasures of the Cosmic Ocean"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Primal Seed"" + ""Pot of Acquistiveness"" + ""Ravenous"" + ""Gift Exchange"" + ""Gale Dogra"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"" to save 120 SR and 60 UR!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 630 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Between 60 card pile Rikka/Aroma/Sylvan I feel like this is the best 40 card version I can currently come up with (totally open to suggestions otherwise)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deck is focused on advantage and recursion. Your main focus of the deck is to get into Sylvan Dancepione as quick as you can to get the excavate highroll. Since most monsters in the deck offer advantage or a way to keep pushing the combo forward it kind of doesn't matter what you hit as long as you hit a single plant at the very least.&nbsp;</p><p>Hitting 3 plants off Dancepione is also completely okay and is most often the absolute best high roll, leading to the best ending board you can make from the sheer advantage you can get.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck also centers around heavily abusing non-HOPT effects, primarily being multiple revivals of Sylvan Hermitree and Aromaseraphy Jasmine/Aromage Jasmine.</p><p>The hand fixing this deck can do is absolutely off the charts in my opinion, you should be getting at the very minimum 2 Hermitree draws and 1 Aromaseraphy Jasmine draw for just doing your end board as you would normally taking all other cards out of the equation.</p><p>Sylvan Charity is absolutely the best card in the deck even in 2024 now but suffers from sequencing conflicts. Example: You want to Charity first to fix your hand but once you continue that sequence into making Dancepione; you learn you would have benefitted more from holding Charity and taking the gamble on making Dancepione first. But that is why I call this deck&nbsp;<strong>Highroll.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, you will see 90% of your cards with any given hand with how many 1/2 card starters there are- compiled with the raw advantage from multiple draws (3+) and searches (Humid Winds, Mardel, Sweet Marjoram, Aromalylith Rosemary).</p><p>The most common end board i've managed to land on with this deck with any given hand would look something like:</p><p><strong>Benghalancer </strong>(1 Bounce, LP loss is irrelevant), <strong>Aromalylith Magnolia</strong> (Board Protection fusion+ATK boost), <strong>Aromage Sweet Marjoram</strong> (OPT destroy a card on Life-gain), T<strong>eardrop the Rikka Queen</strong> (Quick effect tribute an opponents monster), and usually at least 2 of the 3<strong> Dried Winds , Humid Winds , Blessed Winds </strong>(Usually you will draw one or two throughout the combo, and search the outlier from Sweet Marjoram if you placed anything other than Humid Winds face up off Aroma Blend)</p><p>Thanks for reading, hope you give it a try. If you're interested in a 60 card build honestly throw in the Rikka core and Sunavalon/Therion stuff and mess around as you see fit but I found it didn't help this specific build as it really skews the RNG from Dancepione with that much variance (though summoning Petal or Mudan from Dancepione is pretty sick)</p>"

Then you use Nunus Gy effect to revive itself before then tribute it using Daybreak giving you 2 tokens and getting it off the board so you don't get reptile locked. Then you use the tokens and Nauya to either make the link 3 if you have fuel to use its search effect or a second copy of the link 2 and going into Sunavalon Dryatrentiay and searching bloom so that you can negate your opponents entire board on their turn and setting up a potential otk for your next turn.</p><p>This is the best build I have found after a few days of testing and I am sure with more testing that better builds will be found that possibly focus on supporting a specific deck to boost the power that Raika already has.</p>

Since Alich destroys itself automatically, you can play D.D.R. as many times as you like.</p><p>4) It's time to send Seed Cannons to GY and deal damage. Since Banisher delivers everything to BZ, we have to close Banisher with ""Book of Moon"". Now, 3 x Seed Cannon can be sent to GY to deal 3 x (500 x 5) = 7500 damage in total.</p><p>5) Since the damage isn't enough, we have to try again. Open Banisher with ""Book of Taiyou"" to unlock ""Primal Seed"" loop another time. Here, play ""Soul Release"" to banish 1 x Book of Moon + 3 x Seed Cannon. Then, retrieve combo pieces needed with ""Primal Seed"".</p><p>6) Repeat what was explained in #3 + #4 + #5 until your opponent is dead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spiral Spear Strike"" deck. 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Turn 1.5 cards -> 6+ negates and follow-up!,"<div>Historically, Superheavy Samurai has been an obscure rogue archetype possessing interesting unique gimmicks found almost nowhere else - gigantic defense position beatsticks attack while in defense position (applying DEF as ATK), the duelist is rewarded/punished for having no spells and traps in GY, and stealing your opponent's backrow to use as your own. However, with the release of Indomitable Pride, Superheavy Samurai has evolved from a simple beatdown deck into a potent combo machine!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Twelve 1.5 card starters, a link-1 monster reborn and a non-once per turn ""ROTA"" grant this strategy incredible ability to create monstrous 3 to multiple negate boards, while having tons of follow-up for next turn! The extreme consistency of this deck's starters also give Superheavy Samurai ridiculous amounts of space for staple cards - allowing for 15+ handtraps to be maindecked!

Arcana + Oracle + Museum,"<p>Welcome! In this deck, we will slowly but surely kill the opponent thanks to ""Dark Snake Syndrome"" without attacking, which is granted by ""Ghostrick Museum"". Let me explain!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YcUxhhpl8pQ"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gameplan</strong></p><p>1) At one point, play ""Time-Tearing Morganite"". Then, while ""Light Barrier"" is active, either Special Summon Arcana with Saryuja or Tribute Summon Arcana thanks to Morganite. Choose the outcome as&nbsp;<strong>heads</strong> to always skip your opponent's turn at the cost of sending two of your monsters to GY, which is guaranteed of 2 x Cockroach Knight cards later on.</p><p>2) Fusion Summon Oracle by using Swirl + Ghost as materials by activating Swirl. Then, if you have played ""Into the Void"" while holding 2 x Cockroach Knight, activate ""Ghostrick Museum"" and 3 x Dark Snake Syndrome. Finally, end your turn but don't forget to send two of any monsters but Oracle + Arcana to GY.</p><p>3) During the first turn, if you haven't noticed, Cockroach Knights were placed on top of the Main Deck. When your turn begins, you will draw two cards instead of one thanks to Morganite and you are going to draw exactly those Cockroach Knights. Since you are able to Normal Summon or Set twice instead of once, you can place Cockroach Knights on the battlefield. When your turn ends, you can send them to GY with Arcana and skip your opponent's turn. With Cockroach Knights being placed on top of the Main Deck, this step can happen as many times as you want or until the opponent is dead.</p><p>4) During the Standby Phase of yours, Dark Snake Syndromes will deal some damage, which will be doubled during each Standby Phases of yours. Although Syndromes deal damage to both sides, thanks to Oracle, what you took will be converted into LP. Thus, you will be immortal while your opponent is going to embrace the death. Also, why bother attacking while ""Ghostrick Museum"" blocks you doing that and giving your opponent slow and painful death with 3 x Dark Snake Syndromes...</p><ul><li>If interested, there are other cards which prevent you from attacking your opponent, seen in ""Side Deck"". Feel free to have a look.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you wonder how to save up some SR and UR points, I can show you:</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contract Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Into The Void"" + ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 180 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" can be found within ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack to save 60 SR!</p><p>- ""Arcana Force XXI - The World"" + ""Light Barrier"" can be found within ""Hand of Fate"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR and 30 UR!</p><p>- ""D/D Swirl Slime"" can be found within ""Cross-Dimensional Contracts"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""T.G.

Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"
