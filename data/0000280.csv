This version of the <em>Exodia</em> <em>deck</em> focuses on drawing tons of cards, stunning the opponents destroying &amp; negating everything they play until we get the 5 pieces in hand. <h4>Strategy:</h4> The deck must be exactly 40 cards in order not to lower the probability to draw the 5 pieces. The only monsters we play have the ability to retrieve the 5 pieces of <em>Exodia</em>, their effect is triggered in the graveyard so they aren't affected by Skill Drain.  We want to buy ourselves some time with cards such as <a data-name=""One Day of Peace"">One Day of Peace</a>, <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> and <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> (which triggers our monsters when hits them). <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> should create problems for the opponents that will almost certainly rely on their monsters' effects.  For our protection we have <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a> and <a data-name=""Solemn Judgment"">Solemn Judgment</a>, but also <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> works well in disrupting the opponents' plans during their turn.  <a data-name=""Reckless Greed"">Reckless Greed</a> must not be used until you can activate 2 or 3 simultaneously (to skip only 2 draw phases, but drawing 4 or 6 cards) or, alternatively, in desperate situations.  <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> could be sided-out if the opponent doesn't make a big usage of monster effects in our turn. <h4>Possible variations:</h4> Probably more cards to defend from attacks as <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a> could be needed (some testing is required to clarify). In case, could remove 1/2x <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> and/or 1x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>.  A 3rd <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent</a> could fit well in the deck if needed.  The 3x <a data-name=""Reckless Greed"">Reckless Greed</a> could be too greedy and may be substituted with 2/3x <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> in order to have some further protection, especially from cards not triggering <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a>. The remaining 1/2x slots could be taken by 1x <a data-name=""Obliterate!!!"">Obliterate!!!</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu"">Legacy of Yata-Garasu</a> (or <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a>) or 1x <a data-name=""Wall of Revealing Light"">Wall of Revealing Light</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> or 1/2x <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>.  Alternatively, instead of using 3x <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> we can afford one more monster, 3x <a data-name=""Cyber Valley"">Cyber Valley</a>, and substitute 2x <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> with 2x good defending cards as <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a>.  One more version could be using cards as <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> and <a data-name=""Rivalry of Warlords"">Rivalry of Warlords</a> to block the opponent (maybe substituting <a data-name=""Skill Drain"">Skill Drain</a> and some <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>). <h4>Side Deck:</h4> - <a data-name=""Messenger of Peace"">Messenger of Peace</a> is the most valid spell we kept outside the deck, so it might be added if necessary to defend more - <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a> / <a data-name=""The Transmigration Prophecy"">The Transmigration Prophecy</a> is a desperate partial remedy in case the opponent manages to make us discard some pieces - <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>, <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>, <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> in case needed depending on the opponent - <a data-name=""Floodgate Trap Hole"">Floodgate Trap Hole</a> and <a data-name=""Quaking Mirror Force"">Quaking Mirror Force</a> in case you want to choose the strategy to flood the opponent field with monsters and stop some combos - <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Bribe"">Dark Bribe</a> in case the opponent makes use of specific critical cards to be stopped <h4>Extra Deck:</h4> The only used monster is <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> thanks to <a data-name=""Starlight Road"">Starlight Road</a>, but we need it to have 15 cards anyways for the <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>. In case of suggestions and better ideas of monsters that can be actually used in specific situations, please leave a comment and let me know. <h4>A few <strong>extra useful cards</strong>:</h4> <em>Monsters</em>: <a data-name=""Battle Fader"">- </a><a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a> (not awesome since only prevents direct attacks, but still ends the battle phase from the hand) - <a data-name=""Swift Scarecrow"">Swift Scarecrow</a> - <a data-name=""Crystal Seer"">Crystal Seer</a> (nice to cycle through the deck fast, but it's a problem with Skill Drain) - <a data-name=""Cyber Valley"">Cyber Valley</a> (very strong, but it's a problem with Skill Drain)  <em>Spells</em>: - <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a> - <a data-name=""Draw of Fate"">Draw of Fate</a> - <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> - <a data-name=""Field Barrier"">Field Barrier</a> - <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a> - <a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a> (one of the best alternatives to <a data-name=""Reload"">Reload</a>, <a data-name=""Card Trader"">Card Trader</a>, and <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> since you can choose which cards to recycle, but still it's a -1 in hand)  <em>Traps</em>: - <a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu"">Legacy of Yata-Garasu</a> - <a data-name=""Good Goblin Housekeeping"">Good Goblin Housekeeping</a><a data-name=""Legacy of Yata-Garasu""> </a>- <a data-name=""Jar of Greed"">Jar of Greed</a> - <a data-name=""Waboku"">Waboku</a> (good to gain 1 turn, prevents all possible attacks risks) - <a data-name=""Dimensional Prison"">Dimensional Prison</a> (only stops 1 attack) - <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a> - <a data-name=""Wall of Revealing Light"">Wall of Revealing Light</a> - <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick - </a><a data-name=""Time Seal"">Time Seal</a>  <em>Please leave some comments to let me know what you think and take a look at my other decks!</em>"

With the downfall of the dragons, however, most are led to believe that this archetype stands no chance in today's dueling world. <strong>WELL NO MORE!</strong> This deck can compete with the rest of them, though it doesn't need most of the other support cards - unless you're playing pure. But this deck is combo-based and is keen on Special Summoning as well as searching. You can even play around Nibiru, as you can summon Crystal Wing on the fifth summon (Normal Summon <span>The White Stone of Legend</span>, Special Summon <span>Destrudo</span>, Synchro into <span>Black Rose Moonlight</span>, Use world legacy Guardragon to bring back <span>The White Stone of Legend</span>, then make the <span>Crystal Wing</span>). You can even get spicier with your combos if you get the chance, and even end the game with a classic <span>Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.</span>"

And look at that it makes Orcust much more playable. What I want to show you is just the prototype since I don't know the correct ratios yet and I am also considering to go through other engines as well, just as dagda and souls.  The good thing right now is that halq is still legal, so we can use jet as a 1 card halq. But what do we do with halq? It's simple we get bombard and use it and halq to go into gala, then we can shuffle the Jet back and get an Orcust sp/tr. Now if we have an Orcust in hand we can extend further since we have bombard in gy. We also can play brave since we don't need our normal summon anymore, so say goodbye to bricky scrap golem combos.  Btw we can also use Small World, everything we need is a level 3 monster, then we use Terrortop as a bridge and get access to either Jet or Girsu aka the best cards in the deck.  I see alot of potential here and think that Orcust might be a rogue deck if not even a T2 deck. It just needs abit more testing."

So you should read this decklist.","Abyss Actors are my favorite deck, and they have been getting some good placements recently... well they've been getting any placements, and thats about all I can wish for. The main strategy of abyss actors is going second, as their best cards like comic relief only really work going second.  If you are going second the basic plan is ""RISE OF THE ABYSS KING TURBO"", the combos you can do are more complicated than this, but its good to keep that idea in mind, because it really is the best card in the deck.  Now, onto the questions you may have: ""Why the Mystic Mine in the main, while the going first cards to support it are in the side."" There are two reasons, 90% of the time you will be going second the first game, so you don't need your going first cards. The second reason is that it allows you to play around hand traps going second. Say your opponent has a wide board with cards left in the hand. You play mine and it either chews through a spell negate, or it stops them from playing any effects. Then you can do all your combos staying under their cards, and when you are ready to attack, you play RISE OF THE ABYSS KING to destroy your own mine and their monsters. And from that point you'll probably win. If they end their turn on one or two monsters then you can instead side it out for the dark ruler. I would do droplets but those are expensive.  ""What do I do going first"" Side in everything, summon bagooska, summon sloth, set demise and solemn. Then hope they can't beat that. Else, go to game three.  ""Why are you running evil heel, he's not that good and another level 4 would probably be better to help with going into bagooska."" True, however Evil Heel is my boyfriend and I love him, so I am going to run him.  ""Why the change of heart"" It just got unbanned and its a funny going second card, arguably just using comic relief is better, but it will at least chew through a negate, so whatever.  ""Why should I play this deck"" It's a great deck, and it literally costs like $40ish dollars to build, also the max rarity cards are cheap, so you can look at shiny cardboard for cheap. Also Evil heel is really hot and you should play a deck with him in it. There are literally zero problems with this deck.  ""Why not just play metalfoes for a cheap pend deck"" It doesn't have evil heel in it.  &nbsp;  So as you can see there are exactly zero problems with this deck, so you should totally play it."

The Ghost Ogres are probably better as Ash, as it's another zombie to trigger Balerdroch, but unless Ash prices drop drastically, I will not be owning any.

To do this your main goal is to get into <em>Junk Speeder</em> so you can get multiple synchrons on the field so you can go into your bigger monsters such as <em>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</em>, <em>Chaos Ruler</em>, <em>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</em> (which you go to off of <em>J</em><em>et Synchron</em> and <em>Chaos Ruler</em>), and <em>Baronne De Fleur.</em>  ALTERNATIVE CHOICES IN THE DECK:  <em>Baronne De Fleur</em> can be swapped for <em>F.A. Dawn Dragster</em>  If the format requires it, you can switch <em>Stardust Charge Warrior</em> for either <em>Brionic, Dragon Of The Ice Barrier</em> or <em>Infernity Doom Archfiend</em>. This should only be done if the format requires it as the extra draws are very important in the deck.  EXPLAINING THE DECK:  The Ascator engine is a free <em>Chaos Ruler</em> which helps to make a target for <em>Junk Synchron</em>.  <em>Junk Converter</em> is used primarily to get either <em>Junk Synchron</em> or <em>Stardust Synchron</em>.  WE DO NOT PLAY TUNING. WE DO NOT NEED IT. Instead, We Use <em>Synchro Overtake</em>. With <em>Synchro Overtake </em>you target the <em>Junk Warrior</em> in your Extra Deck to either add to hand OR SPECIAL SUMMON <em>Junk Synchron</em>. Please note that if you special summon <em>Junk Synchron</em>, it will not get its effect to special a level 2 from grave.  The <em>Stardust Synchron</em> engine is a free level 8 and more. It is a pretty self-explanatory engine but has high value.  The 3 <em>Emergency Teleportation</em> is huge in this deck. It allows for extended plays and more negates. In this deck, I run <em>Psychic Ace</em>, <em>Psychic Tracker</em>, and <em>Ghost Ogre</em> as targets for <em>Emergency</em> Teleportation. I find that I usually lack non-tuners, but if you feel you need more you can swap the <em>Psychic Tracker </em>for <em>Psychic Wheeleder</em>.  <em>Accel Synchron</em> takes a page out of chrystron's book and allows you to synchro summon during your opponent's turn. This is a great way to disrupt them. Because of this immense utility, you should try and keep <em>Accel Synchron</em> and one other level 5 monster on the field so you can synchro summon into <em>Satellite Warrior</em> during your opponent's turn. <em>Satellite Warrior</em> lets you essentially clear your opponent's board, gaining attack for each card it destroys."

This deck was a little challenging to create because a lot of her new support relies on Exhange Of The Spirit and the new cards that support it.  In order for this to work correctly I felt I had to combine Key Cards that she used against Kaiba in Battle City during season 2 of Yugioh Duel Monsters.

Now, you have two route depending on your hand and matchup, against light based opponent, you don't want to banish adhara since you want to use baxia eff to destroy monk of the tenyi and SS adhara. route 1: banish Adhara to add Ashuna from banish, chixiao would search for Mo Ye or Longyuan, Mo Ye will reveal ashuna to synchro lv 8 (baxia or drago berserker of tenyi) or longyuan would discard ashuna to become chengying. route 2: Chixiao search for Taia (no wyrm or swordsoul) or Mo Ye (have another wyrm / swordsoul card), synchro lv 8 baxia then destroy monk of the tenyi to SS adhara from GY, synchro 9 chaofeng lock light  4 card: the combo is pretty similar with 2 card Mo Ye, but you start with Longyuan first to synchro baronne to avoid nibiru, then you will synchro Baronne, then lv 8 chixiao, alternatively you can do this with taia for three hand combo.  Archnemeses Protos: generally not first turn card, except you know you will fight against PK or dark attribute based deck, also a good counter for DPE since it could not be destroyed, would destroy DPE and lock DPE from special summoning. However you either hard draw or have wyrm synchro still on the field to actually search this card with swordsoul emergence. You might tempted to destroy your own chixiao if you know you will fight against light attribute based deck."

Take note of the side deck when playing this deck. Since you'll be playing different decks, you can customize the deck to what is mostly being played in the current meta. Play test to find what ratios suits you best. You can push the deck to 45, but I suggest manipulating the ratios in the deck to make more room for more cards.  https://youtu.be/OGUKQ3Kx2Do"

Once you have made GD send Zephyros to the GY with his effect. Bounce the Ravine to summon Zephyros and make Romulus, with Romulus search Glow. Glow allows you to get Mystletainn and summon an equipped Dragunity to the field. The monster that you will be equipping with Mystletainn is GD. Since he's not a HOPT you will use him again and summon Baby Roc. Now with Mystletainn and GD XYZ into Atum and summon RedMD from the deck (it's crucial to detach GD from Atum so you can summon him again with newly summoned RedMD). Your field should now contain Atum (preferably in EMZ), RedMD, Baby Roc, and Gae Dearg. If you have a Dragon/Winged Beast in hand, use GD once more to search Stormwinds. Link into Spheres with RedMD and Atum and Synchro into Savage with the leftover monsters. Lastly normal summon Stormwinds.  On your opponent's turn if your Stormwinds is outed before the Battle Phase, immediately use Spheres to bounce something and summon Drago from deck to get another floodgate live on the field.  <strong>Strengths, weaknesses and other comments:</strong>  The biggest strength of this deck is that it can find pretty much every single card in its deck and the main combo is very consistent so you can often end on Spheres Savage Stormwinds. The biggest weakness is of course Nibiru which is controllable with the Adventure engine. Adventure does so much for the deck, not only does it get you into an Omni-negation but Fateful Adventure lets you discard cards that you want in the GY. Because you run Ravine, Remus, Rite of Aramesir, Gold Sarc, and more, Gamma is often live on your first turn.  &nbsp;"

Makes all dinos on the field immune during the Main Phase that you use this (A lot of people don't notice). If the effect from the hand resolves, dinos on field can't get Ash'd, Nibiru'd, or any other typical prevention effect. Normal combo is to send to grave, banish and summon <a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a> and combo from there.  <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> - One of the main cards, can make a decent combo alone. Searches any dino from deck. Normal summon then search <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a> and go from there.
