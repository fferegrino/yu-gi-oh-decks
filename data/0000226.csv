Besides the Virtual World core, every aspect of the deck can be changed to the pilot!

Typically, the Synchro monsters are used while going first, while the XYZ monsters are your offensive options (barring Number 75, which is your Nibiru block). If you get the right set up on Game 1, you can go for the Caliga/Crystal wing board to hold down your opponent's board. I wouldn't recommend going for it in Game 2 or 3, however, as it's pretty susceptible to backrow (especially Dark Ruler No More).

<span><strong>GOING FIRST</strong></span>
The best board I've built is Wolfrayet (play this first so you can generate attack gain to turn it's quick effect live), ShenShen and Chuche with Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer on board as well. This board provides constant disruption, with Shen sending everything from field to GY (laughs at Live Twins), Wolfrayet intimidating your opponent from spinning their entire monster row back into the deck (either limiting the monster effects they want to play, or the monsters they put on field in the first place), and both Chuche and DPE being constant threats of quick destruction.

The only issue with DPE &amp; Shen is that, if DPE leaves the field w/o Shen, DPE will be banished, and can't be revived by it's own effect. So it's the effect you want to activate last, if you can. And when you do, Shen will be your target. You can recur Shen on your next turn, so it's not the biggest deal. But you do lose your interruption of cards from field to banish instead of GY. But with that slight drawback comes the ability to make HUGE PLAYS on your Turn 3.

If you're not OTK'd after going first, you will likely have all that you need to break your opponent's field. Denier &amp; Malicious in GY lets you summon Denier for free. Doing so can revive NyanNyan as a tuner, which will get banished when it leaves the field. You can then use the Malicious in GY to summon one from hand. With no other set up, you are able to summon a Rank 3 XYZ, a Rank 6 XYZ, a Level 6 Synchro, a Level 9 Synchro, or a Level 12 Synchro! And when you Synchro with Nyan and it's banished, you can return the Malicious back to your deck, then used the Malicious in GY to summon the one from GY again! And don't forget, if you set yourself up, you'll have a Qinglong, Chuche and/or Xuanwu to make the plays you want. If you play well, you should have a board every turn.

<span><strong>GOING SECOND</strong></span>
XYZ monsters will typically be your best play. Depending on your board, the Level/Rank 6 Virtual World ED monsters can come through for you, with Jiujiu being indestructible and able to send one card on field to the GY, or Fanfan banishing one face-up card and one card in either GY, as well as floating on destruction. Utopia Beyond is amazing for nerfing any high stated monster (I used it so I can out Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax). And AA-Zeus is AA-Zeus; self explanatory.

The deck is flexible, so assess the board that your opponent created; more often than not, you'll have a way to break it.

<span><strong>SIDING</strong></span>
The main targets I sided out were
<ul>
 	<li>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring x2</li>
 	<li>Foolish Burial Goods x1</li>
 	<li>Emergency Teleport x1</li>
 	<li>Fusion Destiny x1</li>
</ul>
That gives you five cards to work with. However, siding is flexible in every match, so swap to what you think is best (there were some times were I even sided out one Impermanence)

The main focus of the siding is the Crossout Designators, and I feel VWs can play through almost anything as long as interruptions are blocked. After game 1, I always side in Crossouts and one Nibiru &amp; DRNM, as those cards can blow open your field. And of course, every sideboard needs backrow hate. The Effect Veiler was here in case I came across heavy combo decks I wanted to block ASAP (Floowandereeze, for example).

<span><strong>WHAT I'D CHANGE</strong></span>
After going 4-2 at locals (losing to Dragon Link and Floowandereeze), I would change the following...
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Taking out the Ultimaya package</strong>. While the board CAN work, it's also incredibly telegraphed, and can be blocked hard. And with the board being so committal of an option, too much needs to go right and I only made this board once in all of my matches that day.</li>
 	<li><strong>Add a quick Zombie World package.</strong> Floowandereeze is a PAIN for this deck. But I learned after my match with Floowan that I could have easily added Beatrice/Necroworld Banshee/Zombie World package and be able to essentially block the entire deck. I would take out Effect Veilers and one Twin Twisters from my deck deck for the main deck cards.</li>
 	<li><strong>Add Cloudcastle (other two ED spots flexible)</strong>. I found myself with situations where I wanted to revive Shen w/o banishing targets, and making Cloudcastle would have corrected that immediately. And I want to try Crystron Quariongandrax and Jinzo - Layered or Photon Strike Bounzer, as they are both solid options as well.</li>
</ul>
<strong>FINAL WORDS</strong>
Virtual World has quickly grown to become my favorite deck. It's strategy allows it to dodge many staple hand traps, and can build into unique boards that you won't see many other decks utilize (Level/Rank 3/6/9 monster pool!). Plus, if played properly, the entire deck recovers itself! The release of Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer only pushes this deck further. I usually don't add packages to my decks, but DPE/Mali/Denier work too well for me to every NOT use it again.

Virtual World is like Mario or Ryu in video games: This deck can have anything you need to win. And it's ceiling is as high as the pilot's skill can take it."

DISCLAIMER : This deck currently is not at full power, as it still gets the new Fusion in the coming months. So while this game can win games currently if handled right, it will take more skill than it will after the structure deck releases, at that point this deck will have a much stronger pressure with more streamlined plays. So keep that in mind and also dont worry if you mess up while testing, even though I have been playing maids since release, in all forms, this version makes me missplay or do suboptimal plays too. But the better you get with it , the more rewarding it feels. Also lets not kid ourself Albus and Ecclesia would look cute in maid uniforms.

But first of all a replay to show what this deck can do CURRENTLY , as mentioned it will get better plays soon. So here is a meta game vs birds : In comments

So lets get into the card by card :

3x Albion the shrouded. Its mainly there for 2 purposes, send to grave as big dragon for your maid fusions and making branded in red live. If you dont need it, its still a upstart goblin that sometimes baits an ash cause people cant read.

3x Dragonmaid Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.

3x Dragonmaid Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere

1x Dragonmaid Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.

1x   Dragonmaid Ernus : Can summon a maid in your opponents turn before they set up the negats , else just for its name and level

1x Dragonmaid Lorpar : Name and Level again. But its also a decent card to force a negate with its discard effect and it screws Zeus.

2x  Noctovision : Make striker = free summon,. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype. Also it chain blocks your Fallen of Albaz super poly effect : D

2x  Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With Sky Striker and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion. Also it lets you dig for cards and other cards which may save your day when the opponent starts playing solitair. Also it annoys sky striker and we love to do that

1x Tempest Dragonruler of Storms : Its a extender that searches when banished. What else do you want? More Dragonruler?Konami says no

2x  Fallen of Albaz : You summon him of Sphere most of the time and just poly away their boss Monster for a titanclad, its a easy dragoon out, as if they negate sphere bounce you just summon him and fusion dragoon away. Its probably my favorite non maid in this deck.

1x Ecclesia : Basically you can search her when you go second or have a super poly on legs that you can chain block if you brick hard / get negated in your turn

3x High spirits of the Branded : I think this card explains itself, its just bonkers broken and should never have been printed. It allows infinite combos and gives you any extender you need + a free add in the Ep. AND it can recycle itself.

1x Branded in Red : Its a searchable fusion that recycles Material and can be used during your opponents turn to dodge the flash Drnm and stuff. Not much to explain I hope

3x  TTT : Yep TTT, Yep draw 2 , Yep steal your monster

3x  Droplet : Negate all and just combo from gy. simple

2x  Dragons Mirror : Banish stuff from gy to make Sheou and if you have tempest also get a free search

1x Called by the grave : Why. Does. this. still. exist.

3x tidiyng : extender who also can be used as interrupt or to dodge cards out mine, trigger House and so much more

&nbsp;

Extra Deck :

I really feel like there is not much to say here, make sheou + sphere and than just use whatever you need when you need it.

<a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> is a really good card for the deck, but it works without it aswell. If you have him go for it and play him.

This deck is mainly for going second, the striker cards can break boards really easy. You can even play more going second cards in the Main Deck like <a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops.

Sauravis allows you to turn any monster in your hand into any other monster in your deck. This allows you to exchange combo pieces as required, exchange duplicates, or in a pinch, allows you to exchange a Dragoon material for any other monster.

Red-Eyes Black Dragon and Eva are the only real outliers, but for REBD, you can reveal Idaten to add any Drytron monster you need, and for Eva, you can banish Draconids.

In addition, Sauravis can be used to negate Infinite Impermanence, which is the bane of any hand with Triple Tactics Talent.

This can also be used to:
<ul>
 	<li>Add ANY monster card to your hand (except Red-Eyes Black Dragon) using Sauravis as the second target.</li>
 	<li>Swap a Machine (aka. Drytron) for another. For example: Delta into Alpha.</li>
 	<li>Swap a Fairy for another. For example: Orange Light into Diviner. This is handy for adding Orange Light if you already have full Drytron combo.</li>

Too expensive in IRL so I built this for online play.,"Just a fun casual-competitive Dark Magician deck that runs my favourite boss monsters. I grabbed inspiration from a TeamSamuraiX1 video as well as from a few other Dark Magician decklists here on YGOpro. <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> is there as a placeholder/substitute for <a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a>. If you need to swap out cards, I recommend one less Navigation, <a data-name=""Magician of Dark Illusion"">Magician of Dark Illusion</a>, and maybe<a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician""> Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>.

General strategy is to find a way to set <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> (<a data-name=""Magician's Salvation"">Magician's Salvation</a> is one way of doing that) and throw Dark Magician cards (including DM the Dragon Knight) into your GY. Dogmatika splash cards are excellent for that too. Dragoon is there for classic disgusting play and passes."

Who said Swordsoul is boring.,"<strong>For those who wanted a more creative Tenyi Swordsoul list look no further! </strong>

<span>Switch these cards to change from Combo to control:</span>
<span>Combo uses: <em>1 Shthana, 1 Mare Mare, 3 Dark Ruler no More, 2 Emergency Teleport, 1 Forbidden chalice;</em></span>
<span>Control uses: <em>2 Solemn Judgement, 3 Gravity Collaps, 3 Guiding Ariadne;</em></span>

It can do multiple combo's but and it all starts what u have in you hand. There are multiple paths to get into Mare Mare Combo. It all depends if you go second as you need to destroy a card with Yazi.

<em>Prep for yazi:</em>
Option 1:<em> To get into yazi you have 2 tenyi'x at least 1 tuner -&gt; Halq -&gt; Ghost ogre -&gt; banish ashuna for Shthana and make Yazi.</em>
Option 2: <em>Emergency teleport + Ashuna or Shthana -&gt; Yazi.</em>
Option 3: <em>Swordsoul emergence -&gt; Taia banish Emergence -&gt; Yazi</em>

The above options are easier with consitency cards like Vessel and even normal summoning Ghost Ogre is fine. Halqi fibrax helps with getting ghost ogre as the level 3 tuner. Use Yazi to go into mare mare. This is where its gets fun! As Mare Mare allows you to get 3 tokens and tokens are great!

<strong>It depends what you want</strong>

Destroy monsters:
<em>If you have Halq on board you can use Mare Mare and Halq to go into Draco masters of the Tenyi to destroy effect monsters up to 4 of you have Monk in grave.</em>

Need swordsoul:
<em>Use Ashuna to special Shthana + lvl 4 Mare Mare to make Chixiou search for swordsoul longuan.  Link 2 tokens into Shaman Use longuan and  (adhara can add a wyrm back to you hand to use as cost)  synchro into Chengying. Discard 1 card to special mare mare draco beserker. This is well over 11900 damage.</em>

Get Halqi and synchro with 1 card:
<em>Swordsoul emergence -&gt; Taia.  Summon Taia banish Emergence to special token and reduce level.</em>
<em>Synchro token and Taia to make Yazi.  Sending Mo Ye Use its effect to destroy -&gt; special Mare Mare from deck, use effect to special 3 tokens. Use Mare Mare + token for Halq use effect to Special Ghost Ogre from deck. Use Ghost ogre + 2nd Token to make cupid Pitch increase its lvl to 7. Sycnhro cupid pitch and 3rd Token to make Chixiou or baxia.</em>

<strong>Control variant:</strong>
Yazi isn't a core aspect. Halqi is the king of this combo. If you go first Turn 1 is making halq with the Tenyi's and using Guiding Adriane to search a counter trap with Baxia destruction effect. Baxia can be made with Taia or Mo ye. Gravity Collaps is the main target to stun your opponent. Also Halq summons Ghost Ogre from deck for another distruption.

On your opponent turn: Use Halq to synchro Desert locust to make then discard and sending the said desert locust with Gravity Collaps to stun your opponent for a turn.

<p>All Vylon <a title=""Equip Spell Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Equip_Spell_Card"">Equip Spell Cards</a> can only be equipped to a Vylon Monster and have a secondary effect that allows the player to search for another Vylon <a title=""Spell Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spell_Card"">Spell Card</a> when they are sent from the field to the graveyard while face up. This is perhaps their greatest asset, as it allows Vylon decks to keep their card advantage from their Spells as long as there are other Vylon Spells in the deck.</p>
<p>In <i><a title=""Duel Terminal - Judgment of Omega!!"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Duel_Terminal_-_Judgment_of_Omega!!"">Duel Terminal - Judgment of Omega!!</a></i>, four Vylon Tuner monsters (levels 1 through 4) were introduced that have the ability to be <a title=""Treated as Equip Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Treated_as_Equip_Card"">Treated as Equip Cards</a> when sent from the Monster Card Zone to the Graveyard (even when used for a <a title=""Synchro Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon"">Synchro Summon</a>) at the cost of 500 <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Life Points"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Life_Points"">Life Points</a>, each providing different effects when they are equipped. In <i><a title=""Duel Terminal - Xyz Startup!!"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Duel_Terminal_-_Xyz_Startup!!"">Duel Terminal - Xyz Startup!!</a></i>, the Vylons obtained two <a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Union Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Union_Monster"">Union Monsters</a> that can be equipped to another Vylon to grant effects when the equipped monster destroys another monster in battle, as well as one of the first <a title=""Duel Terminal"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Duel_Terminal"">Duel Terminal</a>-exclusive <a title=""Xyz Monster"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Xyz_Monster"">Xyz Monsters</a>, ""<a title=""Vylon Disigma"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vylon_Disigma"">Vylon Disigma</a>"".</p>
The Vylon strategy revolves around the use of <a title=""Equip Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Equip_Card"">Equip Cards</a>, their effects often only working when they have at least one equipped. Their Equip Spell Cards can search out other Vylon Spells from the deck when they are sent to the Graveyard from the field, and most of their Tuner and Union monsters (except ""<a title=""Vylon Cube"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vylon_Cube"">Vylon Cube</a>"") can become Equip Cards. Their Equip Spells activate even when the monsters they are equipped to are destroyed or used as <a title=""Synchro Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Synchro_Material"">Synchro Material</a>, letting their users gather the right tools for the situation at hand at any time, though they should always be aware of the number of Spell and Trap Card Zones they have left to work with. One should try to keep at least 1 Spell or Trap Card Zone open so that they can respond should the duel's situation suddenly change."

&nbsp;

<span>MEHD stands for Musket Eldlich HERO Despia, as those are the four engines used in this deck (yes, that is a lot). Because of just how many engines there are, there’s actually no real way for your opponent to know what to expect; it plays on their expectations in later matches when you pull out Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord instead of sitting on your Magical Musket interruptions and a Phoenix Enforcer. Plus it’s just fun to play because of the variety!</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The idea for this came out of trying to optimize another of my favorite archetypes, Magical Musket (the Musket part in MEHD), which had a problem with keeping its low-ATK monsters on the field for the turn. I went through an Eldlich variation a while back, which worked relatively well but had problems with consistency. Then I was reading the Despia article that came out this week, and I realized that changing your opponent’s monsters’ attack to zero was a sure way of making it through the Battle Phase with your weak Magical Musket monsters. Thus, an idea was born: why not combine all three, plus add a 5-card fusion engine that’s all the rage now? </span>

&nbsp;
<h1><b>The Main Deck</b></h1>
<h2><span>Tech cards:</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<span>In order to maintain consistency, I tried to limit the amount of engine-based cards to 36 so I could keep 3 Pot of Prosperity and an Upstart Goblin. I exceeded my expectations, keeping it to 30 cards, allowing 6 additional tech choices, of which I chose Summon Limit and Lord of the Heavenly Prison to slow down the opponent and add another body and consistency. Lord of the Heavenly Prison can give you protection and a free Spell/Trap, or it can just provide a body by setting and then activating a normal spell (this is useful when you really need a Liebe).</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span>Magical Musket Engine:</span></h2>
<span>The Magical Musket engine I streamlined as much as humanly possible to still get good results: 2 each of Starfire and Casper and 1 of each of the 4 best Magical Musket Spell/Traps. Magical Musket works very well with Eldlich the Golden Lord, as the Spell/Traps are useless without their monster counterparts, so they’re free of cost for use with the Golden One. Also, because of the massive amount of spells in this deck, you will almost always have enough to activate both Starfire’s effect to summon Caspar and Casper’s effect to add a Musket Spell/Trap, giving you an interruption or Spell/Trap negate. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>It’s actually interesting because I thought the Musket Engine would wind up being useless due to the power of the other engines. However, they actually prove incredibly useful! All of the Magical Musket monsters can activate their effects if your opponent plays a Spell/Trap in their column. So if they’re dumb enough to activate a Prosperity vertical of your Caspar, you get to search another Trap for interuption! Magical Musketeer MAX can be an automatic Verte, Phoenix or even Unicorn depending on how many Spell/Traps your opponent has, or it can just be a good way to net interruptions, as it too is a Magical Musket monster. The Magical Musket Spell/Traps are also immune to Spell/Trap removal, as they can be activated from hand. The only reason you would need to set them is for Lord of the Heavenly Prison’s effect. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>So, even though I only included them for my own pleasure, they actually have some phenomenal utility I wouldn’t otherwise have.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span>Eldlich Engine:</span></h2>
<span>The E in MEHD and the beef of the deck at a 12 card engine, this too is a bit more streamline compared to typical iterations of the Eldlich archetype, cutting Eldlixir of Black Awakening entirely and playing only two each of Haquero and Conquistador. Eldland and Sanguine are still at three for maximum utility, however, and the Golden Lord himself is at two. I also added one Eldlich the Mad Golden Lord in the extra deck because you can summon it and it is a pain to out. There are a few ways to play Eldlich that I think may be different from the norm with this deck, so let me go over those:</span>

&nbsp;

<span>First off, you NEVER want to keep Eldland into the Battle Phase, because it locks you out of attacking with anything other than Zombie monsters. Also, use Sanguine exclusively on your opponent’s turn: it locks you into Zombie monsters, which you don’t have a lot of (or really any of). Also, if you need to get rid of floodgates (ie Summon Limit or Eldland) or you have a useless Spell/Trap (ie spare Branded Openings or Destiny Fusions), simply set them and use Eldlich’s effect in the grave to remove it and get a free, hard-to-out body on the field. Thus, it can be imperative to get Eldlich in the grave. There are a few ways to do this: Link Summoning, Fusion Summoning and Eldland’s second effect. All of these are possible and can get your Golden Lord to the grave for that free body or necessary removal (which you would only need to do if you need to get out Accesscode or Liebe to beat over a stupid powerful monster). I think that’s it for the differences, and everyone reading this should know how to play Eldlich. If not, there’s a comments section for questions.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span>HERO Engine:</span></h2>
<span>This is your typical Destroy Phoenix Enforcer engine. The only notable interactions with the other engines in this one are that Enforcer won’t have its attack changed to zero by Quaeritis’ effect due to being a Level 8 Fusion monster. You can also set all of your Spell/Traps to make use of Celestial’s effect. Your leftover Fusion Destinys can be used as fodder for the Golden Lord’s effects. Magical Musketeer Starfire can be a free Verte if you need an Enforcer that bad.</span>
<h2><span>Despia Engine:</span></h2>
<span>The reason I initially put this in was because of Quaeritis’ unique effect which helped with keeping my poorly equipped Magical Musketeers on the board for the next turn. But it then turned out it had a whole lot of utility, as Theater of the Branded can fusion the Mad Golden Lord and once used can be removed for cost. Note that every monster in the deck is LIGHT or DARK to maximize the utility of the fusions, though Proskenion is almost never summoned (and is a prime Prosperity target). I am incredibly proud of how this engine has performed, and I wouldn’t get rid of it. It’s also another normal-summonless fusion engine for any Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika players who want something different to have. Note that Opening does require a discard (but it’s not for cost, so if it’s Ashed you don’t have to!)</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span>Extra Deck:</span></h2>
<span>Most of the Extra Deck is self explanatory, however I have a few notes:</span>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>You almost never use the Xyz monsters, and most of them are useless unless going second.</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>That being said, the three machine Xyz monsters are one of your only two ways to beat over huge bodies and are also your best OTK strategy going second (you can make Gustav using Golden Lord and Lord of the Heavenly Prison)</span></li>
 	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Prosperity targets tend to be the Xyz and Fusions you won’t use plus the extra Musketeer MAX and/or Imduk.</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h2><span>Side Deck:</span></h2>
<span>The side deck is a bit thrown together, however it includes a lot of going second options because this deck is absolute trash going second. I suggest messing with it. Summon Limit and LotHP are typically the ones you’ll side out.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span>Final Notes:</span></h2>
<span>There aren’t any handtraps in this one because you won’t need them: you’re going first. And anyways, they didn’t fit. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>As always, if you have any questions, ask in the comments. </span>

&nbsp;

<span>Thanks for reading this long article; I have another deck that I’m proud of if you want to look at it. It’s Code Talker, and it has a VERY different playstyle, so maybe you’ll be into it if you don’t like this one.

Yes you can take out 1 Coinorma, 1 Arrowsylph and 1 Hedgehog for 3 Ash Blossom. But since I play local and  non competitive I don't have these cards.

Your main objective with this deck would be to bring out Tarotrei using Pot Of The Forbidden as a tribute so you can SS it with Tarotrei's effect during the end phase. Then just use the Shaddolls to inflict damage to your opponent.

I built this deck after the Construct ban a long time ago that's why you see no light monsters here(4 should be enough because there's super poly as well)."

Two decks I have always loved are HEROES and Kozmo, and until recently they really couldn't be played together in a cohesive strategy. However, that all changed with the release of Destiny HERO- Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. with DPE's effect destroying your ships triggering their effects to get you more advantage while getting a pop on your opponent's side of the field is always nice. What this also does is allow for cool turn ones on the play, and the draw as well. I know the deck is over 40 cards and I'm working on cutting it down any feedback and criticism are greatly appreciated."

The way this deck works is to turbo out Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon, Dystopia the Despondent, and/or Number F0: Utopic Future if going first and Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale or Zeus if going second. The reason why it's so consistent is because 38 of the cards are co-dependent, so ~99% of your starting hands won't brick because each card gets each other out. The other 2, Ash Blossom and Solemn Strike (other negates in the side deck if wanted), are the two ( or more/less) negates required so that way you don't die. Now for some questions I know some people will be wondering.

-Why not run 3 copies of Cobalt Sparrow and (insert the name of the gray main deck Lyrilusc card whose name I forgot, her effect is to search a Lyrilusc spell/trap to the hand)?

Both cards' effects are a hard once per turn, so you wouldn't gain anything from summoning multiples. Also, neither of them can summon themselves, so it would make more sense to run just 1 copy of each to lower the brick rate as much as possible while still running them for their sweet, sweet effects.

-Why are there so few negates in the main deck?

Every monster in this deck is either level 1 or a hand trap, so there are a minimum amount of negates to lower the brick rate. That's also why the rest of the negates are in the side deck, so you can add/subtract to the negate count. It should honestly stay at 2, they're good emergency use cards and the actual negates come in the form of Utopic Future Dragon.

-Can't you just Kaiju or Lava Golem the Future Dragon?

Yes you can, but more likely than not, you can get out 2 dragons. And seeing how you give your opponent a 3000 attack beatstick by using Lava Golem and Kaijus being completely dependent on the heart of the cards, I think you're fine.

-Why is there a random link monster in an Xyz-based deck?

Utopic Future Dragon's effect is to negate a monster effect activation and kidnap the monster if it was on the field. Due to how widespread monster effects are in the competitive metagame, this puts a shutdown to that. But if your opponent were to just not read the dragon's effect, you'd need a link monster that can handle 3 effect monsters because you'll have 3 remaining monster zones after the dual dragon turboing. So you have a monster that can kidnap monsters at will. If you'd like, you can swap it out for Borrelsword.

I think that's all the questions, and I have nothing else to add, so I guess I'll see you around!"

Full combo endboard.

DPE, baroness, savage or crystal wing, scythe and abyss dweller.
<p>This board would beat the majority meta decks slightly fragile at the start of play so if your opponent does not draw any hand traps or you draw into adamancipator cards or prank-kids Rockies and exceed. There is about a 70 percent chance you will still manage a full combo or a 90% chance you will have an end board of DPE, Savage and scythe. which is still a pretty decent board</p>
Going first can play through up to 3 hand traps and nib.
