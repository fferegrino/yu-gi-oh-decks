The side deck are just some other extra deck options that I have run before (abyss dweller) or xyz's that seem to be popular with this archetype. Marincess Wonder Heart is a great card, and I have seen a lack of it on the decklists shared here, so I figured I would share my list for anyone wanting a marincess deck that runs her as well as the usual package. i take two pots of avarice in case of any board wipes the opponent may have, so that you can rebuild your marincess', should they be met with an unfortunate end. The Underworld Goddess is the card I am swapping out for Stealth Kragen for the link mode duels.</p>"

Dinosaurs are a super fun aggro deck for casual speed dueling that can beat down the opponents very quickly. With the Ultimate Predators starter deck still readily available (as of October 2022) you can build really cheap Dino and Insect decks.</p><p>First up, we run (2) Dark Driceratops. With 2400 attack (2700 with Dinosaur Kingdom), this is a formidable boss monster that can dish out piercing damage to defense position monsters. Most importantly though is that it can beat over Jinzo.</p><p>Next, we run (3) Hyper Hammerhead and (3) Gilasaurus. Hammerhead gives us a very handy bounce if an opponent attacks it, while Gilasaurus will give us a free special summon to use as tribute for Driceratops. Gilasaurus is the card you really want to open with so your opponent can't benefit from it, so that's why we need to run the max amount.</p><p>We top off the monsters with (3) Gale Lizard, another card that can bounce monsters back to the opponents hand and can be used as fuel for Ultra Evolution Pill for another free special summon.</p><p>For the spells, we'll run (2) Night Beam and (1) Ultra Evolution Pill. Night Beam will help clear the backrow so we can go in for huge damage and Pill will give us a free special summon off of Gale Lizard.</p><p>For traps, we have (3) Kunai, and (3) Floodgate Trap Hole. Kunai and Trap Hole are arguably our most important cards as we want to make sure our opponent's monsters are in defense position as much as possible.</p><p>For our skill card we'll run Dinosaur Kingdom for the extra attack.

I've been through a few iterations of this build. There's a few 1-of tech cards that I like, specifically Quillbolt Hedgehog, that works amazing with this deck. You can essentially swap out the 1-ofs (except Plaguespreader) to run the side deck cards. You can also cut them out completely to move to deck to 41/42 cards. The Spright engine has insane synergy with Adamancipators, allowing you to go either Sprind/Elf/Gigantic or go for your Dragite/Crystal Wing board early.&nbsp;<br /><br />Notable cards to consider:</p><p>1. IP: Masquerena (initially part of the Halq build, but without Halq it's not that viable. Necessary if you go Borreload)</p><p>2.a Borreload Savage Dragon (I run Crystal Wing instead but this is a good extra deck option if you run Masquerena)</p><p>2.b Draco Berserker of the Tenyi (EEV target. Possible option over Crystal Wing/something else. Definitely worth slot consideration)</p><p>3. Gigantic Spright (2 can be run if you decide to drop Chengying/other)</p><p>4. Coral Dragon/Herald of the Arc Light (2 strong synchros that are easily achievable. Coral is a +1 and is essential later when the Icejade synchro releases in the set next year)</p><p>5. Spright Starter/Jet/Smasher (all possible cards to add depending on your meta where you live. I find the current ratios of Spright cards to be perfect so far though).</p><p>6. Cat Shark (Rank 2 that can be used to stall. Pretty good with getting EEV plays off, if you side in EEV. No space currently but it's an interesting extra deck choice)</p><p>7. Eradicator Epidemic Virus (If you decide to run Borreload/Draco Berserker and/or another Gigantic Spright and/or Cat Shark, it's definitely viable. Meta based but currently too many cards need to be dedicated to running it, so it's just a possible option if you want to try)</p><p>Damn. Guess I did have much to say, haha.</p>"

The main thing here is to just beat your opponents down until you can stick Summoned Skull on board and start swinging.</p><p>The sidedeck is built to smokescreen side into Soul Control, which is probably the best deck in the format (tied with Stall Mill). Dragon Capture Jar and Stop Defense are present to deal with other meta decks.

Rikka completely wrecks this deck unless you manage to TCBOO turn 1, even then they have outs. Spright and mathmech are also bad matchups as they make it very difficult to put lethal on board and have insane recovery. Flunder loses if you can stick final sigma or TCBOO, and we run a decent number of main-deck outs to barrier statue. Anti-spell isn't great but I have it there for if I suspect the opponent will make me go first, it also kills trap decks if you draw it with denko.

If we have another bird in hand and don't have either the field spell or Simorgh Onslaught, I recommend grabbing one of those two. It also has the aforementioned self-revival effect.</p><p dir=""ltr"">3x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=52843699"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/52843699.jpg"" data-card=""52843699"" data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Perfection"">Simorgh, Bird of Perfection</span></a> - This is the man right here. This chad is what makes it all possible. When a Winged Beast is Normal Summoned <strong>or</strong> Special Summoned, Perfection lets us immediately Normal Summon a Simorgh monster from our hard, including itself. When Perfection is summoned, we can send a Simorgh monster to the grave <em>as a cost</em> (so it can't be negated) to get a Simorgh spell from the Deck. The cost is important, as we can send a self-reviving bird to the GY to immediately bring it out. We can also send Darkness if it's not already in the GY.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x&nbsp;<a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=50820852"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/50820852.jpg"" data-card=""50820852"" data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Beginning"">Simorgh, Bird of Beginning</span></a>&nbsp;- This bird allows us to Normal Summon an additional Simorgh monster when it's Normal Summoned. A little lackluster, but it does have a valuable self-revival effect which will allow us to link climb or Tribute Summon. Note that its first effect will miss timing if summoned via Perfection.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=23619206"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/23619206.jpg"" data-card=""23619206"" data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Calamity"">Simorgh, Bird of Calamity</span></a> - This bird lets us send one Simorgh card from the Deck to the GY. Use it to send Simorgh of Darkness or another small bird that can revive itself. Calamity itself can also self-revive.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=95192919"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/95192919.jpg"" data-card=""95192919"" data-name=""Simorgh, Lord of the Storm"">Simorgh, Lord of the Storm</span></a> - The first of our big beatsticks, Lord of the Storm cannot be targeted by Spells or Traps. It can also bounce any of our opponent's cards when a Spell or Trap is activated, at the cost of a Simorgh monster. Remember the small birds that can revive themselves? Use those.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x&nbsp;<a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=22586618"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/22586618.jpg"" data-card=""22586618"" data-name=""Simorgh of Darkness"">Simorgh of Darkness</span></a>&nbsp;- Fantastic beatstick that can bring itself out for free from the GY when we Tribute Summon any monster. Plenty of ways to get it there as mentioned before. It also has a very valuable Spell/Trap negate, at the cost of a Simorgh monster.</p><p dir=""ltr"">1x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59707204"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59707204.jpg"" data-card=""59707204"" data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Protection"">Simorgh, Bird of Protection</span></a> - Since the small Simorghs only revive themselves if the S/T zone is empty, Protection is a great bird that can bounce a S/T card when Normal Summoned.

This is a better going-second bird than Lord of the Storm, but you can adjust the ratios of them as you see fit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">1x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=4991081"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/4991081.jpg"" data-card=""4991081"" data-name=""Harpie's Pet Dragon - Fearsome Fire Blast"">Harpie's Pet Dragon - Fearsome Fire Blast</span></a> - The Harpies' newest support also helps out Simorgh as well! A pretty good extender that can Special Summon itself if a Simorgh is on the field. Upon being sent to the GY, it can send a small Simorgh to the GY too. Do note that it's a Dragon, not a Winged Beast.</p><p dir=""ltr"">1x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=29587993"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/29587993.jpg"" data-card=""29587993"" data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</span></a> - Apex Avian being a Wind Winged Beast is a blessing for this deck. We can bring it out via Sovereignty or Tribute Summoning, and it's a non-one-per-turn omni-negate at the cost of returning any Mist Valley card to the hand, including itself.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=55063751"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/55063751.jpg"" data-card=""55063751"" data-name=""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"">Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju</span></a> - Stormwinds Statue is banned so we can play Gameciel instead of Gadarla.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=14558127"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/14558127.jpg"" data-card=""14558127"" data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></a> - You can add a third forehead girl if you want.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Spells</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">3x <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=92223430"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/92223430.jpg"" data-card=""92223430"" data-name=""Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh"">Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh</span></a> - An amazing field spell that has two extremely important functions. The first allows us to reveal a Level 5 or higher Wind Winged Beast monster, and for the rest of the turn, the Tribute cost of all Winged Beasts is decreased by 1. The second effect allows us to immediately Normal Summon a Winged Beast monster, which will allow us to extend our combos further.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=28617139"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/28617139.jpg"" data-card=""28617139"" data-name=""Simorgh Onslaught"">Simorgh Onslaught</span></a> - Great searcher card that lets us discard 1 Winged Beast to add both 1 Wind-attribute and 1 Dark-attribute Simorgh to our hand. As with Perfection, I recommend discarding either Darkness or a small bird. Also, we only run 2 copies because of its tendency to brick occasionally.</p><p dir=""ltr"">1x <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=64002884"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/64002884.jpg"" data-card=""64002884"" data-name=""Simorgh Repulsion"">Simorgh Repulsion</span></a> - At this point, I should note that the mini Simorghs can only bring themselves back from the GY only if our opponent controls nothing in their backrow. A non-issue if we go first, but if we go second, Simorgh Repulsion lets us bounce all cards in their backrow at the cost of discarding a Winged Beast. It also has a lesser-used secondary effect like Onslaught, which allows us to decrease the level of a Winged Beast monster in our hand by 1. It's only really applicable to Dark Simorgh and Apex Avian though, and most likely we're going to be Special Summoning them anyway.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=49238328"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/49238328.jpg"" data-card=""49238328"" data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</span></a> - Our Extra Deck is fodder for the Pot, with the exception of Bird of Sovereignty (obviously) and Harpie Conductor. Everything else isn't really needed.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=24224830"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/24224830.jpg"" data-card=""24224830"" data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</span></a> - We need as many of our searchers to go off as possible.</p><p dir=""ltr"">1x <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=18144507"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/18144507.jpg"" data-card=""18144507"" data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</span></a> - All-around excellent card to wipe our opponent's backrow, while also allowing our mini Simorghs to activate their GY effects.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Traps</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">3x <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=87639778"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/87639778.jpg"" data-card=""87639778"" data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</span></a> - Probably the most broken card in the entire game, Harpie's Feather Storm turns off all of our opponent's activated monster effects for the <em>entire turn</em> if we control a Wind Winged Beast. It's ridiculously powerful in Harpie decks and fantastic in Simorghs. This can win us the game if we manage to draw into it. Feather Storm also has a secondary effect to search Harpie's Feather Duster from the Deck or GY upon its destruction, which is, again, really helpful for our birdies.</p><p dir=""ltr"">2x <a class=""type-trap-card"" href=""/card/?search=80101899"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/80101899.jpg"" data-card=""80101899"" data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</span></a> - Our sole Feather Storm searcher since we aren't running Hysteric Sign. We only run 2 of these because Feather Storm is literally the only other Trap card we play. Also, note that after we activate one Trap Trick, the other one becomes a brick, so you can run 1 copy instead if you wish.</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Extra Deck&nbsp;</strong>(I'll only go over the important monsters)</p><p dir=""ltr""><a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=72330894"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/72330894.jpg"" data-card=""72330894"" data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</span></a> - The grandmaster himself. During every End Phase, we can summon any Winged Beast we want as long as the levels are less than or equal to the number of unused S&amp;T zones. This means we can go into a floodgate (Barrier Statue), an omni-negate (Apex Avian), or even just a big beatstick. Sovereignty (and any Winged Beast he points to) also cannot be targeted with card effects. He also has a Simorgh-exclusive effect that grants him battle protection by destroying 1 other Simorgh card instead, including the field spell. Sovereignty is currently banned in the TCG and limited to 1 in Master Duel, so we try to keep him alive for as long as possible. It's not the end of the world if we don't though.</p><p dir=""ltr""><a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=85696777"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/85696777.jpg"" data-card=""85696777"" data-name=""Harpie Conductor"">Harpie Conductor</span></a> - When the mini Simorghs come back from the GY, we are locked into Winged Beasts only for the rest of the turn. If that happens, we can fall back onto Harpie Conductor. Any Link-2 will do, really, but Harpie Conductor has the benefit of being the same Type and Attribute as the Simorghs.</p><p dir=""ltr""><a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=26847978"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26847978.jpg"" data-card=""26847978"" data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom</span></a> - Drew into a bunch of small Simorghs and can't get enough of them onto the field?

When summoned by Masquerena, Sovereignty cannot be destroyed by card effects or battle (if another Simorgh is on the field).</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Notes</strong></p><ul><li dir=""ltr""><strong>Basic Link Climb</strong>&nbsp;- Normal Summon 2 small Simorghs (Normal Summon and use Beginning's effect, Perfection's effect, or Elborz's effect; if you have Perfection and another small bird, summon the other small bird first).

Finally, Link into Sovereignty.</li><li dir=""ltr""><strong>Elborz</strong>&nbsp;- Both Simorgh of Darkness and Dark Simorgh are not Wind monsters.

This decklist is my current attempt to get the highest floor/ceiling ratio of an end board.This includes really variable lines and enders depending on interruption from opponent, deck they are playing, current meta counters, etc. Currently this is the version with cards that I have (Baronne in side as an exception).</p><p>Quick note: the side deck are things I'm thinking of swapping into the main/extra</p><p>The goal of this deck is to end on a variety of interaction while giving you a variety of plan b stopping points. For example, muddy/dragoon/hotred combo of cards are incredibly effecient as this deck already excels at making 6's, many times ends with a tzolkin on board to fuse away if you got stopped mid combo, or as an extension point for hotred if you're extra worried about dark ruler.</p><p>Main Deck Notes: I'm still tinkering with VW main deck ratios, but for the most part I find this works out very well. Only thing to consider is toutou(I like it in there as it's an extra normal summon, utility in graveyard, and 6 star wyrm for sinister if you're running that). I tried to make this as consistent as possible, so cutting down another lili and the toutou in favor of free 3 special summons(taketomborg/terrortop or psychic wheeler/tracker) is definitley an option.</p><p>Foolish burial, fbg, and e tele are huge boons as they are all starters on there own, and e-tele is especially huge as you can also just hold it and end on a ghost ogre for extra interaction. Pot of desires is similarly here for the extra consistency. It also plays really well with Chengying as you can use it to cheat a game through just bigger guys.</p><p>Adventure package is here because it gives you a negate before you start going off, is easily accesible through beatrice, every card is great fodder for dumping off VW effects, AND makes the deck able to go into 10's at the drop of a hat. There's so much little incidental synergy that it's hard not to play it. I've put Aramesir and Water at 2 each because I found that getting too many adventure cards was actually an issue, and given all the draw and deck thinning this deck can do it's still accesible at many times.</p><p>The areas where I'm really tinkering are in the hand traps and ""luxury"" slots. Current format is odd and I haven't played enough to see what feels good ratio wise, but this has felt alright. The funny stuff here is that imperm plays well incidentally with tzolkin on top of being just so good and we keep a single veiler because we can dump it off raiser if we really need a 6 star tuner. Ash is ash, what can I say. Lastly, our boy destrudo. Destrudo is the piece of this deck that is just so good. It gives you a dragon effect for dragoon if you get cut off, a tuner to get you into riser at anytime, and the most accesible activator for the 10 star synchros.</p><p>Regarding the extra deck, space is TIGHT. There's definitley a lot you can remove or flex out of depending on what you want, for example i like having a lot of options. We've got lots of interaction(totem bird, Crystal Wing, Dragoon, hot red) that you can end on depending what you want, okay draw/extension(charge warrior, coral dragon, croc), and nice miscellanous big bodies(chengying, mathmech, kinda dragoon).</p><p>Goal here turn one is to usually end on Crystal Wing, chu che, and at least one more piece of interaction. The good thing is if they don't have interaction(or only one piece), you can go WAY further. This is extra nice cause hand traps feel way less prevalent right now. And if they do have interaction, you have so many points where you can tag out and end on something like shenshen with totem bird mathmech, or get beatrice chengying and have nshaddoll ariel as a funny point of removal, or even just shove beatrice dump scythe/pairen summon back scythe to make people hate you.</p><p>The side deck are all little things I've been considering. With destrudo and riser getting into sinister longyuan isn't that hard, but it does require specific lines that are easily stoppable and require investments that could go into arguably better end boards. The zombie package doesn't need to be explained, it's just real funny that shooting riser also lets you drop the banshee then you can beatrice for baelerdroch. If you have Baronne, you can straight up cut dragoon, pairen, and totem bird from the extra deck and have tons of extra space to play with. Dark ruler is just so so good as a board breaker that i've considered cutting some handtraps for multiple copies, but we'll see.</p><p>Too many words for something no one will read, but have at yee.</p>"

This deck has never gotten lower than the top 4 in around half a dozen local tourneys I've went to in the past 6 months since I got into the game in early 2022. From halting prank-kids to super polying all the Albaz, Dragoons, and Despias to shutting down Eldlich and Tearlelements, this deck has held up quite well in the past few formats in one way by just locking graveyards and stealing monsters. Even against decks that don't use the graveyard very often, the 500 point boost from Necrovalley is just enough to punch through a lot of opponents' creatures. Necrovalley is a busted card that denies opponents resources and, following suit, the deck revolves around constantly denying opponents resources.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a static deck list I have archived in September because I wanted to give this deck a facelift. A key issue with this deck is that it is a weenie deck that does not do well against a massive board presence. Going second against a board of, say, Tearelements, Dinos, or Speedroids and multiple omni negates is very difficult. The deck also completely dies to Skill Drain. I&nbsp;do not plan to update this list only because it already works well as it is and I need to test out new deck builds. Ideas include, but are not limited to, Lord of Heavenly Prison, to protect backrow and cheat out a 3k monsters, set rotation in the main board, angel statues as generic level 4 monsters and summon negate.&nbsp;</p><p>Individual Card break down: <br />3 super polys in this deck are essential only because the deck needs monsters. Worst case scenario is that you super poly your own creatures into big boss monsters. With the release of Garura, super poly has much more utility (although at its October price of $25, it might be a tough sell. I'm very happy to have gotten it for $8 a little after release). 3 solemn strikes and 2 judgments. It's more common for anti-meta decks to use 2 strikes and 3 judgements, but because the deck is mostly focused on denying creatures so you can beat down your opponents, you want to remove creatures more than negates spells and traps. Plus, strike is better going second than judgement. 3 Imperms: I believe in the current format it is essential to run hand traps, but you can easily cut these for a solemn or a crackdown if you're on a budget. Gravekeeper's Watcher: Hand trap that negates and destroys activated abilities that discard; kills Danger engine, brave engine's Fateful adventure, morphing jar, etc. Otherwise, it's just a polymerization or rank 4 target. It's not awful but very conditional. An inherent issue of Gravekeepers is that being such an old archetype, they're lacking monster cards that actually do things.&nbsp;</p><p>Gravekeeper Archetype notes:&nbsp;</p><p>Gravekeeper's Heretic: Very good in master duel only. Catches people off guard, but in TCG, it's just too weak.&nbsp;<br />Necrovalley Temple: Sideboard mostly: Use it to boost gravekeepers even more.<br />Hidden Temple of Necrovalley; very good but they don't do enough. Hidden Temple of Necrovalley is not particularly good because of the destruction restriction. If your card is bounced or banished or just beaten over, the card is useless. Again, a problem with gravekeepers is that they lack efficient monsters; fossil dyna does the same job often better,&nbsp;</p><p>Budget builds:&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't want to shell out the money for super polymerizations and its fusion targets like Garura or Predaplants, add generic rank 4s and link 2s like Knightmares. Instant fusion it's that bad either. Try spellcaster routes, polymerization routes like Predaplants or Edge Imp Fluffals, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Get Angel Statue&nbsp;generic Rank 4 targets.&nbsp;</p><p>You also don't need Zeus, but if you're really into the game, I really recommend investing in one because you can shove it into any deck with XYZ monsters and 1 extra deck space (it's a dumb card).&nbsp;Don't deny the power of Zoodiacs&nbsp;because it can get 4 material Zeus. which can push one negate spell speed 2 negates or have two consecutive boardwipes one on your opponent's standby.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Gravekeepers was My first deck ever and I have fond memories of using the deck back in 2003 in elementary school. While I hope this archetype can get more support (the april OCG support is necrovalley support for everything EXCEPT a competent gravekeeper deck), I'm happy to keep toying around with what's available.&nbsp;</span></p>"

However, it is at times too slow and extremely luck based, which is the big reason I don't play this deck often in tournaments. This deck has a better chance of winning games 2 and 3, assuming you actually make it to the end of games 2 and 3. I first brought this to an LGS tournament at the POTE release and has done reasonably well with upgrades and reprints that have made eldlich staples affordable.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I built this deck because I knew the effectiveness of control decks in trading card games such as Magic the Gathering and the infamous Blue/White control deck. However, much like those control decks, the decks drag out the length of the game which can get lethal in YuGiOh should you hit time. The average game lasts around 15-25 minutes, even against advanced players or people who knew the Eldlich combo. The games really padded for time when I had to explain anti-meta cards such as Inspector Boarder to players as well. At my first tournament with this deck, I would have won 2-1, 2-0, 2-0, but I kept getting cut for time. I even lost one game after paying 700 life to activate Cursed Eldland only to get ash blossomed until I got cut for time. Stun decks can be slow and are the ire of many players, so be warned abouot piloting this sort of deck.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If you're on a budget, lvl 10 monsters you can use instead are Gizmek, Timelords, Night Express Knight, etc. Add more Skill Drains and Elder Entity N&rsquo;tss if you can; I would add them to the list but they were stolen from me at a tournament :/</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Cards To consider: Ice Dragon's Prison, gozen match, anti-spell fragrance (stops Pendulum decks and nerfs lightning storm). The deck isn't going to end up any stronger anyhow, but they're choice picks.&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br /><br />Because I'm relatively emotionally attached to him but also for more deckbuilding purposes, I believe Eldlich is still a deck worth investing in because the core is so splashable. Zombie world eldlich, Albaz Eldich, Cyberse eldlich, the combinations are galore. Also gets through mystic imne! It&rsquo;s only a dozen or so cards at the core that do not use the normal summon, field spell, or an extensive extra deck if at all.

Spell/Trap board breakers obliterate most duelists this format since they spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to one card. Many boards are made to counter/negate monsters, but hardly anything (maybe except that code talker&nbsp; and salamangreat counter traps) negates spell/trap effects!

Handtrap/interrupt and control your opponent so they don't reach that point! If they manage to get a ""Towers"" out, link climb into Underworld Goddess, Avramax or Accesscode.</li><li>When playing Sky Strikers, game is not necessarily decided on whose lifepoints reach 0 first, its a game of RESOURCES. The main win condition of Sky Strikers is to out resource your opponent, then go for game. Cut off all their avenues of resource generation, and outgrind your opponent's deck!</li><li>Always blind second. This deck cannot really go first, and it's first turn boards are fragile, which would open the way up for your opponent to OTK you on the crack-back next turn.</li><li>Equalize the board state with board breakers, then start your grind game from a position in which you're economically ahead. Once you get going, it's only a matter of time until you out-resource your opponent!</li><li>There are ALOT of link monsters in the GY and field in the Link Regulation Event. Steal your opponent's monsters from GY and field with Shark Cannon, Widow Anchor, Dharc and Lyna for quick and easy link climbing to your link boss monster of choice.</li></ul></div><p><br class=""ContentPasted0"" />And remember duelists...

This makes heavy use of counter trap cards and can use Dinomorphia Reversion to get even more mileage out of them. Pot of Prosperity and Pot of Duality ratios are up to personal preference. I personally like running three Pot of Prosperity and two Pot of Duality, but you can choose to run two of the former and three of the latter instead. Borrelsword Dragon and Dharc can also be replaced with Raider's Knight and Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon.</p><p>EDIT 10/23/2022: I replaced Super Polymerization with Skill Drain. In addition to being a potent floodgate, it can serve as an alternative win condition for the deck by turning Dinomorphia Kentregina into a 4000 ATK beater that can run over just about anything. It's best used as a panic button if you can't turbo out Dinomorphia Rexterm for whatever reason. I also adjusted the Side Deck and included a Raider's Knight and a Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon in place of Mudragon and Dragostapelia.</p>"

This is the more competitive alternative to that deck, using P.U.N.K. as the only main deck engine, and filling the rest of the deck with hand-traps and going-second tools. Why use the Ghostrick extra-deck options? Well, if our Ze Amin or Sharakusai gets negated, we can typically still end on UDF, so long as we have an extender (Foxy Tune / Emergency Teleport / sometimes Deer Note) in hand. I'll briefly go over the goals of the deck and some of the deck's optimal combo lines below, for more info on this deck, consider checking out my other Ghostrick P.U.N.K. build on my page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We rely on the P.U.N.K. engine, so we are playing a full package. We're only on one Field Spell, as it is searchable in our main combo, and can be a dead draw without ways of getting cards into the GY (it can help us to recover our combo, but only with P.U.N.K. cards in the GY). We play one-a-piece of both trap cards as they are great to draw, and having an additional search off of Madame Spider in case we draw one of them gives us another draw off of the Field Spell. We play 2 of most of the hand-traps, one Nibiru, and three Dark Ruler No More, all of which are Crossout Designator targets. These can really mess up our plays, so we obviously want to include as many ways to dodge these cards as possible, but they are also extremely helpful if we have to go second. As long as we can end on Psychic End Punisher, we've created a board that most decks cannot out. We play a small Ghostrick Field Spell package with Mansion, Renovations, and Necrovalley as the Renovations target.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our ideal hand is Ze Amin, Foxy Tune / Emergency Teleport, any other P.U.N.K. monster, Mansion / Renovation / Shot, and Crossout Designator. We normal the Ze Amin, searchign Foxy / another P.U.N.K. we don't have, then special Sharakusai from deck with Foxy / Emergency Teleport (discarding a spare P.U.N.K. from hand if using Foxy). Use Sharakusai to fusion summon Rising Carp with Ze Amin and a P.U.N.K. from hand, then summon Wa Gon and Deer note from deck using the Carp. Search and activate the Field Spell off of Wa Gon, then make JAM Dragon Drive, searching Madame Spider / Ze Amin for next turn and summon back Wa Gon off of Deer note. Remember to draw a card off of the Field Spell. Banish a P.U.N.K. from GY to summon Madame Spider (Field Spell), then use her effect to search a trap from deck (typically Dangerous Gabu), drawing your second card from the Field Spell. Make Psychic End Punisher, then overlay the two remaining Lv 3's for Alucard, overlaying for Angel of Mischief, then detatching Alucard to search Shot / another Ghostrick card. Summon back Alucard with Shot, overlay for another Angel, then detatch again for the remaining Ghostrick card, adding back Shot with Alucard. Activate the Ghostrick Field Spell, set Renovations, then overlay the Angels for Utopic Draco, then Utopic Draco Future. On the opponent's turn, use Renovations to activate Necrovalley from the deck. This is the strongest end board the deck can make, but if we get stopped early we can sometimes still make UDF / Psychic End Punisher, depending on our resources in hand. If you have Ze Amin / Emergency Teleport in hand and another extender, a good way to fish for interruption is to summon Ze Amin and activate her effect. This is a common choke point, and the opponent will likely try to interrupt here if they have any hand traps, but with your extender you can either summon another Lv 3 and go into the Ghostrick / UDF line, or work to get out a Lv 8 and a Lv 3 for Psychic End Punisher, or Amazing Dragon on the opponent's turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this deck list has been helpful and has given you some inspiration to try a P.U.N.K. build of your own! They were hit pretty hard with the recent bans to Chaotic Dragon and Halqifibrax, but can still put up powerful boards and play through interruption; we just need to be a bit more creative now. What are your questions, comments, or suggestions? I'd love to hear them down below in the comments! Thanks for your time, and have a great day!</p>"

With Speed Duels, we get the retrained Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth and a skill card that makes it actually playable. If you're at all familiar with Great Moth's summon cost, it's appalling. Like, legitimately unplayable. Speed Duels are the perfect format for retraining all these old ace monsters. I'm excited to tackle Gate Guardian soon as well.</span></p><p><span>For monsters, we'll run (2) Perfect Moths, (3) Beetron's, (3) Man-Eater Bugs, (2) Cocoon of Evolution, (2) Petit Moth, and (1) Kumootoko. Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth is our boss monster that we'll want to get out to bash our opponent. With its huge attack, the moth can deal out some serious damage. Beetron is there to be a regular 4-star beater as well as a way to recruit fallen insects from the GY to use as fodder for our skill card.&nbsp;Man-Eater Bug is standard old-school monster removal and always good to have. Cocoon of Evolution can be used as an equip for Petit Moth to give it a 2000 Def boost, or you can just set it to stall. Petit Moth and Kumootoko are present to be used with our skill card.</span></p><p><span>For spells we'll run (1) Insect Neglect and (2) Forest. Forest is there to boost our Beetron (boost to 1800 ATK) or Cocoon (boost to 2200 DEF). Insect Neglect is a very handy continuous spell that lets us banish an insect monster from our graveyard to negate any attack, providing some very good protection.</span></p><p><span>Finally, we have the traps. We're running (2) Adhesion Trap Hole and (2) Corrosive Scales. Adhesion Trap Hole is more handy protection to cut any opponents attack stat in half. Corrosive Scales is a good card in this deck that lets us focus enemy attacks to one of our monsters and put ""scale counters"" onto the opponent&rsquo;s monsters for each summon. Each ""scale counter"" reduces the ATK stat of a monster by 100. More importantly, it can make the enemy focus their attacks onto Great Moth which is great due to its massive ATK stat.</span></p><p><span>This deck can be built solely with the Ultimate Predators speed duel deck. If you already have that, you'll probably only spend $3-$4 to fill out the rest of the deck!</span></p>"

The Runick package is great for a lot of stall related strategies that aren't named Eldlich, lol. I'm personally really curious now to see what a Runick Witchcrafter deck might look like (or if that'd even work).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Your main goals of this deck are to...<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />1) Recycle and draw cards... A lot.<br /><br />2) Put (preferably) 2 Dragoons on board. This is why it runs Magicalized Fusion, you're going to banish the Red-Eyes in the GY.<br /><br />3) Make a funny monster like Avramax or Big Eye<br /><br />4) Swing really hard with Dark Magician.<br /><br />5) Make The Dark Magicians. This is the Heatsoul of the deck, and you can protect it with Runick Slumber. It helps draw through your deck.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Ebon High Magician can also work as an additional copy of Runick Fountain, though it has its limitations. My reason for wanting to experiment with DMs was because in the event you can't kill your opponent, you can stall long enough to mill or burn them out. Aside from that, i wanted to see how bricky this deck would be, and surprisingly, you can comfortably resolve Red-Eyes Fusion a lot of the time since your Runick cards give you a lot of room to breathe during your opponent's turn.</p>"

This deck while dependent on the GY main focus is to bring about Albaz fusions with Tearalaments. The deck may brick but there's always a silver lining to move around that.<br /><br />Albion the Incandescent is the boss monster for this deck as getting him on the field can mean 2 things, one is a fusion stealing. If you have 1 Albaz in the GY, bring him back up with 1 opponent monster, discard 1 and fuse with anything available on field. The second is resurrection as long as the conditions are met to resummon him which in most case its unavoidable, you can get him back on the field to steal ANOTHER fusion if albaz is still in your GY and u have 1 card in hand.<br /><br />Light of the branded is for you to counter mirror match against tearlaments deck, as it gives u 1 albaz as long as you have 1 in the GY and fuse again<br /><br />Blazing branded king is a utility trap to help you put a stop of various effects during your opponents turn<br /><br />Despian Luluwalith, well if you're going to Mirrojade, might as well go all the way...<br /><br />Guiding Quem, the Virtuous... Give me a moment, I just read her effects so I will slot her in somehow...<br /><br />PS: Sorry for the late update, I was heartbroken when Chaetcaros / kitkalos was banned in OCG, so it was quite a difficult time to fix all the decks that requires her.

In the second turn you can destroy your opponent&rsquo;s field with Berserkion and attack for game.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Low-Level-Magnets are used for setup, Link- and XYZ-material. The Adamancipators are starters and extenders to get more monsters on field and enable Synchro-plays.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Epsilon </strong>and <strong>Delta </strong>do nothing first turn without other extenders, so I choose to play a minimum of them. We want to special them with the <strong>Electromagnets </strong>or the <strong>Adamancipators</strong>.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Doki Doki</strong> can be a great starter/extender, but is vulnerable to nearly every handtrap. In this build it can be a nice bonus, but is not necessary for the main combos.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I cut the Normal-Magnet-Warriors, Valkyrion and Imperion, because they mostly brick in hand. So we have more consistency and space for non-combo-cards.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The archetype&lsquo;s spells help us float the board with more Magnet Warriors from the deck or grave. Both need a Lvl 4 or lower earth-rock (Magnet-Warrior-)monster and also give us some protection. The reborn-cards and Reasoning are options to get the required rock-monster on the field without using the normal summon.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Transmodify </strong>works as a toolbox for further combos or additional disruption by transforming any Lvl-3-Magnet-Warrior to an Epsilon (that reborns the tributed monster), an <strong>Analyzer </strong>(wich is a tuner and does Adamancipator-things), the <strong>Barrier Statue</strong> (that locks both players into Earths) or one more lvl-4-Monster f&uuml;r XYZ-Plays.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The other spells and (hand-)traps are for removal, protection and disruption and can be changed depending on matchup, preferences or budget. <span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Extra Deck:</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In general you can play whatever you want. Even if we can spam out lots of monsters, we never get locked into one specific type or attribute (only with our own Barrier Statue).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I recommend playing the <strong>Gorgonic Guardian, Grampulse, Gallant Granite, Missus Radiant, Knightmare Phoenix </strong>&amp; <strong>Unicorn, Naturia Beast </strong>and <strong>Adamancipator Risen &ndash; Raptide</strong>.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Side Deck shows some options for cards that work pretty well with the strategy. Gozen Match and Rivalry don&rsquo;t restrict the deck too much, although a generic Link2-Rock Monster is still missing in the game.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Torrential Tribute also synergizes with the &bdquo;Tribute&ldquo;-effect of the Electromagnets in the opponent&rsquo;s turn, so we can clear the board and still have monsters on our side of the field.</p>"

At a considerably low price tag and a relatively linear strategy, Numerons are easy to pick up and formidable to fight against. The deck consists of relatively cheap staples, so there's a chance that if you have a spare side deck lying around like I did with my Plunder Patroll and Dino deck, there's a high chance you will have the deck here as well once you get the core. <br /><br />Numerons gates win by doing one thing; find the field spell Numeron network and send to the GY or activate Numeron Calling by controlling no creatures (2 callings are good to be safe). Special Summon 4 Numeron Gates that cannot destroyed by Battle but will be banished at end phase. After activations, The Numeron Gates will have a combined attack of 15000, which should be able to win the game if only by a hair. In the archetype, 3 Numeron Walls are essential to find the field spell or act as a Battle Hand trap and can be searched with Piri Reis Map. Should you go first or are threatened with an overwhelming board presence, you can also Special Summon C1 Chaos Gate Sunya on Top of Number 1 to burn for up to 5k damage or banish all creatures. During Main Phase 2, use the Numeron Gates to summon Sunya or a Link 4 Boss monsters such as Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops and Underworld Goddess. The strategy is compounded with Lava Golem and Kaijus, which can get rid of your opponent's annoying creatures/monster negates and defense position monsters. This deck barely uses the normal summon so take advantage of that. <br /><br />The deck builds can be quite varied as Numerons need to OTK. This intrigues me on a mathematical level with its ratios. They need their field spell to function and they need to OTK. Unlike OTK decks like Dinos or Gren Maju which can play the grind game or open a board of negates, Numerons need to exert their resources as fast as possible. Thus, you need to consistently search. Field Spell Searchers are absolutely essential, thus necessitating 3 Planet Pathfinders and Terraforming and 1 Piri Reis map to play it safe. Because the deck also needs to OTK, I have 4 backrow removal options in the mainboard through Dinowrestler Pankrytops, Harpie's Feather Duster and Twin Twisters. Small world is insane in this deck; almost all monsters are search targets. For example Psy-Frame -&gt; Planet Pathfinder -&gt; Pankrytops; Honest -&gt; Psy-Frame -&gt; Numeron Wall. Ash Blossom -&gt; Lava Golem -&gt; Numeron Wall. Ghost Sister -&gt; Gamaciel -&gt; Lava Golem. The hand traps are all essential ; Ash is a 3 of in most decks, Ghost Sister comes in handy more often than it does not to tank damage while you search. Plus, you can side in more relevant yokai sisters such as belle or mourner.<br /><br />Side Deck: focus on going first cards. Solemns are very helpful. Denko Sekka x2 is mostly used to stall backrow heavy stun decks such as Eldlich until you find a wincon. Torrential Tributes stop your opponents from giving you tokens and wipes your opponent's board. Ghost sister is superb against combo wombo deck and to tank damage. Dimensional barriers are standard sideboard cards.<br /><br />For more expensive/proxy builds: Get 3 forbiddden droplets if you have the money to burn and lightning storms if you really need to win. Some people use limit remover as a budget option but I have never used it in this build. For sideboard 3 Evenly Matched and 3 Artifact Sanctums are great because the sideboard is still trying to figure out what it wants to be. Better Link 4 boss monsters that are not quite budget friendly in 2022 are Mekk Knight Crusadia Avramax and Apolloussa. <br /><br />As far as cards to fear, Floodgates such as Skill Drain, Summon Limit, There can be Only one, and Dimensional Barrier are a problem which is why 3+ Backrow removal exists in the main deck. Nibiru ruins the deck, hence why you use Ghost Sisters. Contact C and token generators can disrupt your strategy at times. Also, you almost always lose on resolution of a Set Rotation / Secret Village of the Spellcasters. (Pankrytops will be the only thing to stop Secret Village). <br /><br />There are certainly pet cards you can put in numerons but I avoid them outright because I like to play this deck competitively. Limit Remover and Leeching the Light are fine in budget builds with the light kaijus. Fairy Tail Lunas are nice with Kaijus but don't do enough. Mad respect if you can get Numeron Chaos ritual and ic1000 numeronius out, but they're too bricky for a competitive build. <br /><br />I hope this guide helped you learn about or build numerons. The gate names are based on Sanskrit, to the best of my knowledge. They're often a shut your brain off deck, but this variant needs to strategize. I rarely see C1 come into play in other decks, for instance, but it does plenty of legwork in this deck. Numeron gates are not as bad in the TCG as they are in Master Duel only because a formidable deck is able to side in better cards, OTK decks are more common in tournaments anyways, and you'll be playing more than one round. Every tournament I've gone to has someone playing Numerons, more often than not with pet cards. However, I am confident this is one of the more consistent builds. <br /><br /></p>"

Plunder Patroll Dragoon toolbox Primer (11/22)<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Meet the Fiends that make up the Plunder Patroll! These little green trolls hop on ships to right what's wrong! Hand traps, dark monsters, light monsters? They're all threatening and need to fight off the Plunder Patroll ships! Won't you join me with this rogue deck primer?</p><p><br />This primer will focus on many types of Plunder Patroll Deckbuilds. This is based on my competitive PlunderI Patroll deckbuild and its has been a 6 month work in progress. It's a formidable rogue deck whose price tag has been easy to swallow over 25ish weeks and during a time when many staples were reprinted. They've done decently well in tournaments in no small part due to the Attributes of the current Meta archetypes. Plunder Patrolls have a series of very bizarre but easy to learn lines of play once you know what your opponent is playing.</p><p>T'he Plunder Patrolls are series of cartoon styled Middle-Age trolls who crew a mix of Nordic/Anglo Saxon Ships based on your opponent's attributes. All have main deck monster cards have mechanics when sent from the Hand or Monster Zone to the Graveyard, and all the extra deck monsters have effects that can be negated with Ash Blossom. I'm not kidding around when I say the deck has very weird lines of play. Don't let that stop you from playing the deck because the combos aren't hard to learn and the little Pirate trolls and their ships are so gosh darn cute. <br /><br />CORE: The core of a Plunder Patroll deck is as follows: <br />16-22 cards and a tight extra deck space. You don't want to run more than 40 because they really need their field spell for a boost.<br /><br />Whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm x3 (tuner + searcher) <br />Redbeard, the Plunder Patroll Matey x2 + (resilient captain)<br />Blackeyes, the Plunder Patroll Seaguide x2+ (returns lost captains to hand)<br />Bluebeard, the Plunder Patroll Shipwright x3 (extender)<br />Goldenhair, the Newest Plunder Patroll x2 (immortal)<br />Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd x3 (searcher + atk boost )<br />Plunder Patroll Booty x1+ (monster reborn + attribute changer) <br />2 of each extra deck captain/ship. 1 Jord. Even if you can&rsquo;t cheat them out, you'll regret not having the ship than having it.<br /><br />Read the cards on your own, the whole mechanic is a novel and half. Where they get interesting is the support you can throw into the deck. I've been toying with ratios and builds since my original Budget Plunder Patroll Rocks build in April and know quite well many of the interactions. I've also tried many different variants of Plunder Patrolls deck and will run down some of the pros and cons of each build. <br /><br />Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon: <br />5 cards<br />Dragoon is an S tier card with F Tier monster but allows you to discard as cost. On activation of Red-eyes Fusion, you cannot normal or special summon but you can still set. These both work for plunders because many cards do not care if they are sent from the field to the graveyard. Thus, you can get away with setting monsters such as Whitebeard, Goldenhair, or Morphing Jar, which don't mind getting flipped up and sent to the Graveyard or discarded. As such, you will hopefully leave yourself open to finding Red-Eyes Fusion. The motivation of this deckbuild is to add as much Ash Bait as possible to get fire monsters in the gy. <br />The field spell can recycle all any garnet in your hand anyways if you need to close victory. <br /><br />Danger! Plunder Patrolls: <br />2-8 cards<br />As many Plunders don't mind being discarded, Dangers are very helpful to special summon and add cards. Stick with lvls 4 and 8, namely Danger Mothman! (lvl4), Danger Bigfoot (lvl8), Danger Thunderbird) for better deck consistency.<br />Note that you should always have as many cards in hand when you discard because when you activate a Danger! card, you don't actually want to discard the monster. <br /><br />Kaiju Plunder Patrolls: <br />4+ cards<br />If your opponents are not playing your archetypes, give them the archetype! Kaijus are just generically splashable anyways, but avoid going over 3k attack because sometimes they just can't get big enough. <br /><br />Adamancipated Plunder Patrolls Rocks!:: <br />About a dozen cards<br />Budget build. It works because you want to special summon Adamancipator Dragite Risen with plenty of water monsters to negate spells and traps and just enough rocks to use Risen&rsquo;s ability to bounce cards back to hand. Not as powerful in higher levels because they can get stunned because there are too many activated abilities and cannot overpower opponents if going first. <br /><br /><br />Brave Engine Plunder Patrolls: 8 cards<br />A very splashable going second build that focuses on getting Fateful adventure which actually has synergy with the deck because you get a discard outlet and a way to prevent your equipped creatures from being destroyed by battle. Going second, find Rite of Aresmir with Water enchantress of the Temple to get a bounce and an omni-negate.<br />It's very frustrating how easy the Brave engine is to use, so much so that they populated so many tournament meta decks in early 2022. I'm personally very bitter that they have not been nerfed in the TCG as they have in the OCG and Master Duel as a wag of the finger against splashing this deck everywhere. The September 2022 OCG Banlist even went so far as to nerf the brave engine entirely by banning wandering gryphon rider and limiting rites and enchantress, making the brave engine only useful in decks that equip such as plunders.</p><p>However, I can understand why the TCG didn't bother hitting the brave engine because they have been powercrept by Tears and Splights.. My personal opinion is that the Brave Engine works well in the grind game, but Plunder Patrolls are better if they go faster and avoid the Brave engine altogther. The engine can be slimmed to 4 cards: Gryphon, Enchantress, Rites, Adventure, but it&rsquo;s not fast enough. Plus, they burn a large hole in your wallet for just a mediocre deckbuild. Nonetheless, Brave plunder Patrolls entered the meta for a very good reason in early 2o22, so feel free to use them if you wish&nbsp; or have the core.<br /><br />Plunders are a formidable rogue deck, but they're deathly scared of cards that banish instead of send to GY such as D Shifter, D fissure and Macro Cosmos. Imperial Iron Wall slows the deck a lot, so watch out. Also, all the extra deck monsters abilities can be negated with Ash, so try to use as much ash bait as possible!<br /><br /></p><p>Runicks (8 to 12)</p><p>Tactical masters brought up a whole new tactic of stun cards and infamous mystic mine and messenger of peace decks. Runicks are not bad for plunders to stop the OTK decks and cheat out level 4 monsters from the extra deck and extend. Runick engine has to take up a significant chunk of the deck but is a formidable build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Immortal Phoenix Gearfrede (2)</p><p>Use his ability to equip plundera and cheat a big monster out. Just an extra boss monster the deck can summon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this inspires you to build or fine tune plunders; they're very resource intensive but catch many players by surprise.</p>"

Currently on the fence between 2 or 3 Lady Labrynth but put 3 for now. 2 Back Jack and 2 Heavenly prison is also ideal - again would consider a 3rd Back Jack but for now this works well. Lady Labrynth, Heavenly Prison, and any amount of set backrow puts up a good lock where nearly your whole field and Lady are indestructable and Lady is untargetable. Your opponent will burn through a lot of resources to out this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spells:&nbsp;</strong>Self explanatory. Some people play 2 field spells but it is too crucial imo so I like 3. Would consider playing 3 Prosperity in addition to or in place of the extrav, but probably in addition to. Duality might be a decent substitute for Prosperity but the special summon lock could be problematic mid game.</p><p><strong>Traps: </strong>A lot to unpack here:</p><ul><li><strong>Welcome Labrythn:</strong> Heart and soul of the deck. Usually you either summon Lovely Lady while the field spell is up to get a non-targeting pop 1 and a hand rip. Alternatively, another common line is Welcome into Arianne to search Lady and immediately summon Lady from hand.

Runick (formerly Mysterune) are an archetype based around quick-play spells that utilize many effects, with an added effect of banishing cards from your opponents deck. Today however, I want to try a more obscure (and probably a plan ""C"") to the Runick arsenal. With the release of ""Spellbook of Judgment"" from the banlist very recently, the card has seen immediate play and has done well for only having one copy being allowed. What is clear however is that these two together can Tank pretty well, despite the upmost milling you have to deal with for yourself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Spellbook engine (if I can say it with the best credibility I can) is almost back to it's former prime as quickly as it fell back in the last decade. With ""Spellbook of Knowledge"", ""Spellbook of Fate"", and ""Spellbook of the Master"" still at 3 copies; the triad of being able to search out ""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"", have you used ""Spellbook of Fate"" to banish your already used up Spellbooks, and then tribute ""Spellbook Magician of Prophecy"" for a Draw-2 is still on the table. What's new is the Spellbook engine is the addition of ""Spright Elf"", which can Special Summon a LV-2/RNK-2 monster every turn; and it does help both ""Spellbook of Fate/Knowledge"" in the turns it can be used. ""Spellbook of Judgment"" is a card that's been recently released from the Banhammer: allowing you at the end phase to search for any Spellbook cards from your deck and special summoning a Spellcaster Monster, with the level being up to the number of spells being played the turn its effect was used. One option I did ought to use for the effect of ""Spellbook of Judgment"" was ""Jowgen the Spiritualist""; and while I did have other considerations in mind, it was a common staple in most Spellbook builds that I still don't understand why until I come to realize I'm playing the Runick Engine and not Mystic Mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now we have the Runick engine which I have plenty of opinions about; but that'll be saved for December. Like I said earlier, Runick is an archetype that utilizes quick-play spells that fill niche mechanics (like monster protection and archetypal searching), while banishing your opponents cards from their deck. The part that also happens to be in these cards is the mechanic of special summoning archetype based monsters from the deck. Which in this case the go to monsters for these effects are (in my opinion): ""Hugin the Runick Wings"" (for being a archetype based ""Terraforming"" and for having card protection on reaction; alongside with being used for ""Spright Elf"" if summoned with ""Instant Fusion""), and ""Freki the Runick Fangs"" (for being a tank that adds any Runick quick-play spell from your GY to hand via destruction). ""Runick Fountain"" is slowly gaining the reputation of being one of the notorious Field Spells to exist (you can guess why if you ever played against it); and the pairing with ""Runick Allure"" (can be searched out via ""Munin the Runick Wings"") also provides wonders that make ""Mystic Mine"" look archaic in comparison.</p>"

The deck has no 'Stratos' so it really is utility-card luck of the draw. One bonus is that your monsters can get out somewhat quickly through Magical Exemplar and cam get quite large through Spell-Counters and Solidarity.&nbsp; It also has really easy access to the Synchro toolbox in Frequency Magician and Night's End Sorcerer, who in themselves offer extra bungus power and worse D.D. Crow effect respectively. Explosive Magician and Tempest Magician also allow for backrow removal and quicker games respectively.</p><p>Other interesting options include Dark Valkyria, which is a Breaker for monsters who doubles as a Gemini-Spark enabler, although it does conflict with Solidarity, being a Fairy.

Enough about them, let&rsquo;s get into the deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Main deck Monsters:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Witchcrafter Schmietta: every low level Witchcrafter has the effect which she can tribute herself, then discard a spell card to summon any Witchcrafter from the deck. What makes Witchcrafter Schmietta unique is the ability to send any Witchcrafter card, in special Witchcrafter Patronus for crazy combos later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Witchcrafter Genni: Genni was the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that this deck was lacking.The effect that she banished herself with another Witchcrafter spell card to use this effect again&hellip; it&rsquo;s crazy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Witchcrafter Pittore: Pittore is very risky but with so many Witchcrafter spell cards in theis deck, I think this is enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Witchcrafter Potterie: She does absolutely nothing &lsquo;cause Witchcrafter spell cards can recover from the GY by themself, but &hellip; man&hellip; she is adorable lol.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Witchcrafter Golem Aruru: a beefie Hand trap, the ability to bounce any opponent&rsquo;s monster or recover a Witchcrafter spell card and with 2800 ATK it&rsquo;s even more juicy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Witchcrafter Haine: Can pop a face up card</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Witchcrafter Edel: Edel was more useful in the past, but today with Witchcrafter Unveiling is no longer escential, nevertheless is a good beater.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Witchcrafter Mademe Verre: The favorite snob loli, this little brat it&rsquo;s an Inferno (i&rsquo;m cursing in my native language). She can negate a face up monster by discarding a spell card, boost a spellcaster by 1000 ATK for which different spell card in your hand, combos with Spell Chronicle and Witchcrafter Patronus&hellip; Now I know why she looks so snobbish in the artwork.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spell cards</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Witchcrafter Holiday: Every spell card of this archetype returns for the player hand if weren&rsquo;t used in this turn, and of course has an additional unique effect.This card is basically a monster reborn for the archetype.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Witchcrafter Unveiling: Special summons any Witchcrafter from your hand, the department that was lacking in this deck.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3x Witchcrafter Creation: Search any Witchcrafter monster from your deck</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Witchcrafter Scroll: Can make you draw a card if your Witchcrafter monster destroys another monster by attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Witchcrafter Collaboration: Makes your monster punch a second time, with Witchcrafter Mademe Verre effect&hellip; this is kind of interesting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Witchcrafter Bystreet: Protects your monster for one destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Witchcrafter Draping: a Mystical Space Typhoon on steroids, bouncing any spell/trap card up the number Witchcrafter you control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Spellbook of Judgment: It&rsquo;s banned for a reason, this card is outrageous, can make you go +4 with the right setup and bring any Spellcaster monster (on in our case, any Witchcrafter monster) up to the number of Spellbooks added to your hand. I hope this card never comes back to the game&hellip; that's because it&rsquo;s so awesome!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Spellbook of Secrets: search any spellbook card.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Spellbook of Power: boost the attack of your monster and can search any spellbook card if this monster destroys another monster for battle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Spellbook of Knowledge: a draw card for spellcaster type monster, can even put some GY setup for future plays and a materia folder for Spellbook of Judgment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1x Spellbook of Wisdom: Protection for you spellcaster and a materia folder for Spellbook of Judgment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Spell Chronicle: This is an honorable Witchcrafter card. The effect that banishes any 5 spell card from your deck, and later can be brought to your hand by the effect of Witchcrafter Patronus and potentially making a 3+ card advantage &hellip; is insane. Combos with Witchcrafter Mademe Verre, Witchcrafter Haine, Witchcrafter Edea, just an incredible teck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trap cards</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2x Witchcrafter Patronus: the effect that matters is the GY one. Banishing itself to add to you handy any Witchcrafter card with different names from your banishment pile&hellip; is insane if you consider you are running Spell Chronicle in this deck.</p><p>3x Evenly matched: awsome tech t&ocirc; go second.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Extra Deck</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The extra deck is more kind of a tool to deal with the unknown, so I&rsquo;ll not discuss it. Your main play is on the main deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A very fun waifu deck , with so many options and so insane plays.. I know that are not a very strong deck &hellip; but come on Potterie is so cute. I hope you enjoy it.</p>"
