The Extra Deck is comprised mostly of fusion monsters, taking advantage of all different ways to fuse these monsters of Chaos. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The boss-monster, </span><em><strong><span class=""s3"">Guardian Chimera</span></strong></em><span class=""s1"">, can be fused with three monsters that have different attributes so it becomes very versatile for any problem you may face. When summoned with a Spell or effect, Chimera has a special ability that lets you destroy your opponents’ cards while simultaneously allowing you to draw a card(s). Be careful, however, because Necro Fusion cannot be used to Fusion Summon this great beast; the only valid way is for monsters to be released from the hand or the field. Plus, while Polymerization is in the GY, Chimera cannot be targeted with card effects by your opponent. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The other fusions also feature easy ways to be summoned with the Small Engines available in this deck. </span><em><strong><span class=""s3"">Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon</span></strong></em><span class=""s1""> can be summoned by either fusing BEWD with another dragon, or can be Special Summoned by tributing a BEWD equipped with a Fusion monster. While it is more difficult to fusion summon, its special ability makes it unaffected by Trap Cards or effects and once it battles, during the end of the Damage Step, the player can target 1 Trap in their graveyard and Set it to the field. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><em><strong><span class=""s3"">Centaur Mina</span></strong></em><span class=""s1""> (1 LIGHT Warrior + 1 Beast) can quickly negate an opponent’s Trap Card during the player’s turn and Set it right back down. Mina can be really easily fusion summoned, especially using her Noble Knight’s effects, and can also Special Summon Level 2 or lower monsters during the Main Phase allowing for Synchro Summoning and more. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s3"">Dinomorphia Stealthbergia</span></strong><span class=""s1""> (which requires 2 different Dinomorphia monsters) utilities the Dinomorphia LP effects to the player’s advantage, allowing for the player to activate Trap Cards or Dinomorphia effects without paying LP. As long as your LP is 2000 or less, you are free to activate all the Trap Cards that halve LP. Plus, if your opponent activates a monster effect, Stealthbergia can inflict damage equal to that monster’s Original Attack. When this fusion dino-machine is destroyed, it brings back one of your Dinomorphia monsters from the GY. This deck provides many ways to Fusion Summon but lacks the endurance for longer encounters so players must be wise about using Dinomorphia cards and effects because of the LP-draining constraints.</span></p>"

It's a really basic strategy. All the cards in the deck are based around getting these cards in the hand. Once you have all of these cards on the field, every time your opponent summons a monster it's attack is halved and you get a token with 3800 attack that can't be destroyed by battle. Scapegoat is also helpful if you can't get black garden. If you find it turning into a stall game you can always use final countdown."

Conveniently, the Rose Dragons are ALSO level 3. So, this deck does most of what Kitchen Synch ( or Rose Brave Tenyi Swordsoul) does, but can also make use of Utopic Draco Future.  &nbsp;  I will briefly explain some of the combo lines that are possible: <ol>  	<li>2 level 3 extenders: very simple but also quite low ceiling, get the 2 level 3 bodies on field, make Ghostrick Alucard, overlay again for Angel of mischief, detach Alucard to search for shot, use shot to revive Alucard, rank up the Alucard into another mischief, make Draco Future.</li>  	<li>Brave Engine plus Red Rose Dragon: Full combo, do brave stuff to get gryphon and the token online, summon either the Rose dragon, make Baronne with Red Rose and Gryphon, use Red Rose to summon Roxrose, search for Basal Rose Shoot, make Halq with rox and the brave token, special Deskbot 001, make Auroradon with Halq and 001, get tokens and 001 back, make Cupid Pitch with token and 001, increase Pitch level, make Borreload with cupid and token. Now you have a choice with what to search off Cupid Pitch, either search Psychic Tracker and use that plus the basal rose shoot to go through combo line 1, or search hop eared squadron so you can make satellite warrior on your opponent's turn.</li>  	<li>Interrrupted line/ brick: pray they dont have nib, and try to make halq at all costs, then continue like in line 2</li> </ol> This list is still very work in progress, i am currently considering Ghostrick Shot at 1, but it's a hard garnet, and obviously the handtrap lineup can change to suit your preferences. I hope you give this deck a spin, and let me know if you have any questions :D"

The main play is usually 2nd turn otk.  A lot of plays are just about drawing cards and summoning Rainbow Neos to clear the board and Vortex and Naturia Beast to negate. Thats about it, everything else is just so you can run over any card. You can also go into Apollousa to negate monster effects since this deck is not running the staple hand traps. Utopia, Accesscode Talker,.. Feral Imps is there to extend the play either for drawing or Pendulum summon, you can put Jigabyte instead of Nefarious it can expand your board a little for that otk. Raigeki is there for I don't know what u can put what ever you want keep in mind that Rainbow Neos is the last monster to enter the field since you cannot summon after using Neos Fusion. If u feel like pendulum Rising is bad bcs there are not enough targets in the deck just put another duelist alliance. Thats all. This is my first deck list that I ever made myself and I got to plat with it in Master Duel in a week. Maybe that's not good enough but i returned to this game now after 6 years so i had a lot of catching up to do! Have fun!"

As per usual, cards on the side will be those that are nice to have but are not necessarily mandatory, if you have them.  Before anything else, I wanna preface this first with a bit of story and a disclaimer that this isn't exactly a budget list due to for some strange reason, all Duelist Alliance archetypes are expensive as shit to build in MD, especially Shaddolls. I actually once loved Rituals, I like building Ritual good stuff decks like Impcantation Relinquished or Impcantation Nekroz, even though most of them looks incredibly similar to each other... until the day Drytrons came. At that time, I was already focused on building more Fusion strategies but it pissed me off how they abused the hell out of both Herald of Ultimateness and Herald of Perfection, and it's just as bad as the days of the formats where those two are being turbo'd or arguably even worse. But that scar eventually got slowly remedied by Konami's decision on suddenly making Dogmatika a Ritual focused archetype (which to an extent makes sense considering all the Extra Deck hate), and I've received an epiphany. Impcantation Dogmatika. (Here's the list for those that are interested, although it's a bit outdated: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/impcantation-dogmatika/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/impcantation-dogmatika/</a>)  <strong>The list:</strong>  <strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Zaborg the Mega Monarch"">Zaborg the Mega Monarch</a></strong> - <span>Upon successfully Tribute summoning with a Dogmatika monster, destroy itself (or another Level 8 or higher LIGHT monster on the field that can be destroyed) to send 8+ cards from your opponent's Extra Deck and all three copies of your <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>, up to two copies of your <a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>, <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, and <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> to the GY for a triple Ritual monster/spell search, a pop or two with N'tss, a <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a> and Dogmatika monster search or Special Summon during the End Phase.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Nekroz Kaleidoscope"">Nekroz Kaleidoscope</a>, <a data-name=""Nekroz Mirror"">Nekroz Mirror</a>, and <a data-name=""Nekroz Cycle"">Nekroz Cycle</a></strong> - <span>Some people only really play 2 Kaleidoscope and 1 of each Mirror and Cycle since they're searchable and they also play Pot of Prosperity, but I'd much rather open with those cards than searching for them, plus more copies means more grind.</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""Nekroz of Areadbhair"">Nekroz of Areadbhair</a></strong> - <span>For some reason, he's legal in MD. You're almost never gonna be using his discard effect. He's here because he's a monster negate that banishes, and Tributes for cost, which could lead to some neat interactions with Cyber Angels and Hieratics (the latter which I may or may not test any time soon, probably).</span>  <strong>• x1 <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis"">El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</a></strong> - <span>A funny card against Drytron match ups alongside <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>.</span>  <strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Soul Exchange"">Soul Exchange</a></strong> - <span>Stormforth for Ritual decks, though it sucks that it targets.</span>  Anything else in the Extra Deck are just either Kaleidoscope or <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> fodders. If you're worried about running out of resources, that's why both <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> and <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> is mandatory. As soon as we get access to the newer Dogmatika support, <a data-name=""White Relic of Dogmatika"">White Relic of Dogmatika</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatikamacabre"">Dogmatikamacabre</a> in particular, this deck and Impcantation decks in general will get even stronger. So yeah, that's pretty much it for the list."

Deck aims to OTK turn 2 or 4 at worst, aim to go second always because you need the extra card and can't afford to give your opponent the chance to break your board. Should be good enough to reach plat V assuming you don't get too unlucky with matchups breaking your win streak. Dies a gruesome death against Heralds and Utopias, most other things can give you a rough game if you don't get a good opening hand with handtraps or misplay them. Not the perfect Madolche deck by any means and quite expensive as far as Master Duel decks go.  Combo is usually:  Magileine normal -&gt; search for Petingcess -&gt; Special Petingcess -&gt; Special Anjelly -&gt; Tribute Anjelly to special Hootcake -&gt; Special Messengelato -&gt; add Chateau/Salon or Ticket depending to game state. -&gt; XYZ summon Tiaramisu and Link summon Fresh Sistart -&gt; Use Tiaramisu's effect to send back the cards used to link summon Fresh Sistart to shuffle back to the deck the opponent's most dangerous cards. Once you get the three spells up on the field you can recycle and search a lot and the deck snowballs from there. Sometimes you don't even need to link summon Fresh Sistart as you might get enough Madolches on the field to OTK."

Generaiders are a suite of boss battle-themed monsters that have quick effects that tribute other Generaider cards to activate them, apart from Mardel. These monsters (except for Loptr) are all Level 9 and can be summoned onto the field with ease with the most important card in the deck, Generaider Boss Stage.  We'll go over Generaider Boss Stage as its own card first. This card allows you to special summon any Generaider from your deck if your opponent draws a card, even in their draw phase, which means its Ash Blossom this effect or suffer. And when a Generaider is special summoned on our opponent's turn, Boss Stage fills our board up with Generaider Tokens, which are basically fodder for your powerful Generaider effects.  Now we'll go over the Generaiders, the monsters of the hour. We are running most of them, because Frodi and Dovelgus are about as good as a dumpster fire. We're running 3 Loptr, 3 Mardel, 1 Naglfar, 1 Nidhogg, 1 Hela, 1 Utgarda, and 2 Harr. Loptr is the only Level 4 Generaider, so he's one of the most important cards to get our metaphorical train rolling. He can tribute a Generaider (including himself) to special summon a Level 9 Generaider from our deck, which is most usually going to be Mardel. Mardel is the first of our Generaiders, and the only one that has an effect when its summoned instead of a quick effect. Mardel allows you to add a Generaider card (not just monster) from your deck to your hand, so this is a consistent way to get our Boss Stage out on field by our opponent's turn. The next is Naglfar, which prevents the destruction of a card(s) by tributing a Generaider monster to be able to keep the card(s) alive. A funny thing can happen with this is if the Generaider Tokens live until the end phase, you can tribute Naglfar to keep the tokens on your board until your next turn, which can come up like once every 50 games. Next is Nidhogg, who tributes a Generaider to negate the special summon of a monster and destroy it, which is by far extremely useful compared to Naglfar. Its a piece of negation without too steep of a cost. Hela can tribute a Generaider to special summon a unique Generaider from your GY, so we can use her to gain access to a Generaider we need in the GY. Utgarda can tribute 2 Generaiders to banish any card on the field. While it is a steeper cost, its non-destruction banish can prove useful against many other decks. And we have Harr, which by far is the most useful main deck Generaider, tributes 2 Generaiders to negate the activation of a card and destroy it. Omni negates are fun :) Harr also has another effect where if your opponent adds a card from their deck to their hand when its not draw phase, you can force your opponent to send a monster from their hand or field to the GY. He can get really oppressive with our funny pet snake when we explain the Extra Deck.  Next our Generaider Spell/Traps. While there's not too many, they are powerful enough to unbrick a hand, bait an Ash Blossom, or straight up gain advantage. 3 Boss Quest, 1 Boss Fight, and 1 Boss Room. Boss Quest reveals a Generaider monster to be able to add 2 Generaider Spell/Traps from your deck to your hand, and you put the Generaider you revealed on the bottom of the deck. You usually don't want to draw or open Generaiders except for Loptr, so you can put the monster back in your deck to special summon it on your opponent's turn. Boss Fight is literally Metaverse for the archetype and your opponent draws a card after, so you can use Harr's effect, Droll and Lock Bird your opponent, etc. Boss Room allows you to discard a card when your opponent responds to a Generaider's active effect to literally change the effect of that card to ""both players draw one card"" which is nuts. You get to draw a card, Harr can do Harr things, Droll and Lock bird can screw up everything. Good shit.  Now onto our generic cards. The good 'ol staples. We got 1 Droll and Lock Bird, 3 Maxx ""C"", 1 Ash Blossom, 3 Lonefire Blossom, Raigeki, Harpie's Feather Duster, 1 Lightning Storm, Terraforming, Called by the Grave, 3 World Legacy Monstrosity, 1 Solemn Judgement, and 2 Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi. Yeah yeah, I know Lonefire Blossom, Monstrosity, and Fists aren't generic, but they're REALLY good in this deck. Lonefire Blossom can tribute itself to summon a Plant monster from your deck... Mardel is a Plant monster. Its basically Loptr, but for exclusively Mardel. World Legacy Monstrosity can special summon a Level 9 monster from your hand, or you can select a Level 9 monster you control to special summon 2 more from your deck with different attributes and types. Hmm... its almost like most of the Generaiders are Level 9. That's handy! Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi is a Counter Trap that's active only while you control a non-effect monster. The Generaider Tokens are non-effect monsters. Its basically Harr but without the tribute, spell speed 4, and not once per turn. I shouldn't have to explain what the rest of the cards do...  Now the Extra Deck! These cards are a rather good reason to play this deck. We got the 'ol reliable duo of Utopic Future and Utopic Draco Future, True King of All Calamities, 2 Number 92's, Infinitrack Earth Slicer, Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity, 3 Nine-Lives Cat, Sacred Tree Beast, The Spider Duo of Pain Gainer and Seven Sins, and Zeus. UF and UDF takes 2 level 9 Xyz monsters that don't have ""Number"" in their name and makes a big 'ol boy that'll negate monster effects and permanently take control of them. Cool! I shouldn't have to explain Calamities. Best Rank 9 Xyz in the game that'll make anyone on the opposite side of the board from him sad. Number 92: Heart-Earth dragon wipes your opponent's board of whatever monsters they summoned during the End Phase. Its amazing in the situations it can come up in, nearly unmatched in what it can do. Earth Slicer takes opponent's monsters destroyed by battle with it and can use them as material for its effect, which is to pop cards on the field equal to the materials used. Its other effect doesn't matter in this deck. Jormungandr is the pet snake I mentioned earlier. It can use 1 material for both players to draw cards, then both players must give one card in their possession from their field or hand to Jormungandr as material. This combined with Harr is nuts. You basically get to rip 2 cards from your opponent for free basically. Very cool! It can get oppressive if your opponent has exhausted all their resources and has almost nothing to work with. Nine-Lives Cat can reborn a Level 9 monster from any GY and it gives it protection. Its very handy, just like Number 92! Sacred Tree Beast is a weird version of Invoked Mechaba. You activate a card or effect during your turn and it can attach a card of the same type to it as material. And when your opponent activates a card, you give up a material of the same card type to negate it. Unfortunately, both of these effects are once per turn and can only be used on their respective turns. The Spiders; Number 84 and Number 77 are not that useful, but more useful than most. Number 84 gain DEF equal to the amount of Xyz ranks on your field x200, and can detach a material to destroy all opponent's monsters with DEF less than its own. Oh, and I guess it deals 600 damage for each Spell/Trap card they activate. Number 77 can detach 2 material to banish all special summoned monsters your opponent controls and you get to take one of those monsters as material for Number 77. It can also detach a material to prevent its destruction. Honestly, if I had 2 more Jorms, I'd use them over these spiders. This answers the age-old debate that nobody asked: ""Which is cooler? Snakes or spiders?"" And finally, Zeus. I shouldn't have to explain it, but I will: attack with an Xyz monster, get a non-destruction board wipe with a 3000 ATK/DEF body.  And that's it for Generaiders! It may be behind VW when it comes to making Calamities, but its such a cool archetype with a unique style of play and it'll be Number 1 in my heart. Its got a ton of plays and starters, but when it bricks... yeesh... Its pretty nuts in the Xyz Festival Event, and can take over the game over a decent bit of the decks, like Numeron who wants to go 2nd and Timelords who do the same, except worse and without an OTK. Also I'd probably run 3 Droll and Lock Bird for Drytrons. Hope y'all learned something about how to play Funny Level 9 Monster Deck :)"

However when it gets going, it can be a real force.  The main idea of the deck is to generally just use the S-Force to build up a level of control and then use the engines available to round out the game.  If you start with Rappa, it's best to just do the usual Gravitino, Platina board with chase set and hopefully and imperm or an ash in hand. Usually, this is enough to disrupt your opponent turn 1.  If you end up with two s force on board with no chase set, you're best off linking into Verte. You then have the option of going into a chaos monster (Daedalus with a field spell up is ideal as it gives you a level of protection) and then making DPE.  Small World is brilliant in this deck too, as it's extremely easy to get whatever S-Force monster you need, due to the LIGHT/DARK attributes and the variety of types.  As for the Chaos monsters themselves, it would probably be more ideal to use the Dragon chaos monsters. I only run BLS and CED because I have them in CR lmao.  I don't run TCBOO as Rappa and DPE clash far too much for my liking. With all the backrow hate in the format, it tends to get wiped pretty quickly too. However, it is an option should you think it is needed.  Let me know what you think of my absolutely jank profile lol"

 &nbsp;  <em><strong>COMBOS</strong></em>  <strong><span><em>Bloqueo de invocaciones</em></span></strong> Cartas necesarias : Zombie world + Rivalry Of Warlords  El propósito de este combo es controlar las invocaciones enemigas, por ejemplo: <ul>  	<li>Tienes Zombie World activado</li>  	<li>El oponente invoca Aleister the Invoker (Spellcaster) pero es cambiado a zombie por el efecto de Zombie World</li>  	<li>El oponente usa Invocation para invocar por fusión a Invoked Mechaba(Spellcaster)</li>  	<li>Encadenas Rivalry of Warlords, entonces el oponente no puede invocar a Invoked Mechaba porque ahora sólo puede invocar monstruos zombies, el bloqueo está completo!</li> </ul> <ol>  	<li>Usa Zombie world en tu turno, si no tienes una en mano búscala con Necroworld Banshee, Terraforming or Metaverse (Estás últimas 2 cartas no están en la lista pero puedes incluirlas)</li>  	<li>Coloca Rivalry Of Warlords  y usala en el turno del oponente cuando invoque cualquier monsttruo</li> </ol> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span><b><i>Limitar la cantidad de invocaciones</i></b></span> Cartas necesarias : Summon limit  Este es el combo más sencillo, en tu turno invoca la mayor cantidad de monstruos posibles y si puedes dejar a los boss monsters es mejor, por ejemplo: <ul>  	<li>Doomking balerdroch, Eldlich The Golden Lord y Vampire Sucker fueron invocados</li>  	<li>En tu Main Phase 2 coloca Summon Limit</li>  	<li>Activa Summon Limit, ahora tu oponente sólo podrá invocar dos monstruos en su turno</li> </ul> Si usaste Summon Limit para controlar las invocaciones del oponente pero nopudiste invocar uno o más monstruos puedes enviar al cementerio Summon Limit con el efecto de  Eldlich the Golden Lord así no te afectará a ti el límite de invocaciones, si no tienes a eldlich en cementerio se paciente  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong><span><em>Remueve monstruos oponentes + Convierte en cero el ataque de un monstruo oponente</em></span></strong> Cartas necesarias : Doomking Balerdroch + Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi  Cada vez que un monstruo zombie active un efecto puedes encadenar el efecto de Doomking para negar ese efecto o para remover un monstruo del campo o cementerio  El efecto de Doomking puede ser activado incluso si el monstruo activado es un zombie del oponente <ol>  	<li>Invoca a Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi (Puedes hacer link summon usando 3 monstruos pero uno de ellos forzosamente debe ser un link 2 por ejemplo Vampire sucker o Avendread Savior)</li>  	<li>Si Doomking Balerdroch está en cementerio: invocalo usando el efecto de mezuki (En tu turno) o espera la Standby Phase para invocarlo por su propio efecto</li>  	<li>Cuando Doomking es invocado encadena el efecto de  Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi para cambiar el ataque de un monstruo oponente a 0 y enseguida encadena el efecto de  Doomking para remover una carta del campo o cementerio oponente</li> </ol> &nbsp;

I just figured that I might want to test it out since I just discovered that Icejades aren't really bad so without further intros I present to you, Invoked Dogmatika Shaddoll Icejades.  That's a mouthful, but I wanna preface this first with the thoughts that #1. This will not be my final iteration of the deck, I most definitely will be testing more of this in the future since I can see a lot of potential from it but I cannot promise that this will be a top tier deck or at least not immediately, #2. This does run 5-6 Field Spells on it, but they are not necessarily bricks, and #3. My side deck was initially designed with <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> in mind, until I remembered that <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a> was a card (or at least going to be a card, which I will discuss in a bit) and this is a deck that plays two different Field Spells that can both be starters.  <strong>Addressing the weirdos in the deck list first:</strong>  • x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Kosmochlor"">Icejade Kosmochlor</a> - <span>This card is the reason why I decided to play Icejades. She's a 3000 DEF body on board that's a delayed Skill Drain, and we all know what that card does, provided that their archetypal Field Spell <a data-name=""Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle"">Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle</a> is on the field.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Creation Kingfisher"">Icejade Creation Kingfisher</a> - <span>I really wanna play more of this card because it's so good with Kosmochlor, but <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a> and <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a> is just too good for the consistency of this deck. I might cut <a data-name=""Icejade Tinola"">Icejade Tinola</a> for an extra copy for insurance but sacrificing utility.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Bridge of Salvation"">Bridge of Salvation</a> and x1 <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a> - <span>This is where the funny comes, with Bridge of Salvation in particular, because it searches <a data-name=""Magical Meltdown"">Magical Meltdown</a>, which I am actually considering on cutting down to only 2 copies because of it, and <a data-name=""Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast"">Rainbow Dragon, the Zenith Crystal Beast</a> acting as a bridge and a LIGHT target or discard fodder for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a>.</span>  • x1 <a data-name=""Icejade Erosion"">Icejade Erosion</a> - <span>This card is one of your interruptions on the Icejade portion of the deck. Sure, it does target, but it's still a negate for a face-up CARD, not just monsters or spell/trap, and it's searchable.</span>  <strong>Some initial testing thoughts:</strong>  <span>1. <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> and the Dogmatika package conflicts against each other, unsurprisingly, but it does leave you vulnerable to being hand trapped, that's why I decided to cut the <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, and its main deck package for either more defensive cards like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or some ratio of hand traps and <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator </a>or more Icejade cards for utility. I'm still on the fence with playing <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a> and <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</a>, but it's always an option but then again, this is still a pretty early phase for me testing this deck.</span>  <span>2. I'm surprised that <a data-name=""Icejade Cradle"">Icejade Cradle</a> is not a once per turn, which actually makes the deck pretty fast at digging through the deck for combo pieces, alongside <a data-name=""Foolish Burial Goods"">Foolish Burial Goods</a>. I definitely am not playing less than three of both cards and Metalfoes Fusion since it's not really a hard brick because it can be used as a discard fodder for <a data-name=""Invoked Mechaba"">Invoked Mechaba</a> against spells.</span>  <span>3. It technically is a smokescreen strategy, because you can go through your initial Icejade stuff without worrying about getting xeno locked in any way, shape, or form and without spending your Normal Summon.</span>  <span>4. The deck can easily swarm, but the extra deck is exceptionally tight. The only reason I play Invoked Cocytus over an extra copy of Invoked Mechaba is that it actually can be a combo piece to maximize the use of your <a data-name=""Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle"">Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle</a>, and is also a 2900 DEF wall that can't be targeted or destroyed by your opponent's card effects which can be further boosted by <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>.</span>  <span>5. As per usual for an Invoked variant, this deck can play extremely well under <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a>, which is always a bonus.</span>  <strong>Closing thoughts:</strong> I am still undecided on whether to make a new list for the succeeding updates or just straight up do the updates on this list and make the changes here directly, we'll see, but I'll definitely be testing more of this deck since I just love Fusion summoning in general. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

I've updated it after testing it out a few times.,"Control the field by having Eldlich and Doomking Balerdroch join forces. You can also take control of the opponents monsters and expand your zombie army.  Some neat techs:  Use Lava Golem to get rid of problem monsters, even if Zombie World up, this doesn't count as a Tribute Summon, you can use this as a back up plan if Rivalry of the Warlords isn't up. Eldlich's 2nd effect will allow you to easily beat over it, with either itself or Balerdroch. Also if you have Zombie Necronize in hand, take control of Lava Golem, get your opponent to 1000 or less life points &amp; let the burn damage finish them off next turn.  Use Vampire Sucker to get extra draws, either summon a non link monster from your opponent's graveyard, or summon a monster from your graveyard. You can also get free draws everytime Balerdroch revives itself which will also allow you to activate it's effect and banish one of your opponent's monsters.  If you manage to send a strong monster to your opponent's grave, use Red-eyes Zombie Necro Dragon's effect or Vampire Fraulein to steal them. If you manage to summon Shark Fortress, and you have the lifepoints to spare, used it's effect on Fraulein to let it attack twice and steal 2 monsters.  As long as you're not interrupted, Yuki-Onna the Absolute Zero Mayakashi can be easily summoned by using Uni-Zombie or Ash Blossom &amp; another monster to summon Crystron Halqifibrax, use it's effect to summon Glow-up Bloom, then use both to summon Shiranui Skillsaga Supremecy. Afterwords use Glow-up Bloom's effect to summon a high leveled Zombie with Zombie World on the field. Then use both to summon Yuki-Onna. Don't attempt to do this on turn 1 just to be safe, a single Ash will ruin the combo.  Use Psy-framelord Omega to recycle banished cards including Mezuki, Necroworld Banshee, the Eldlixer &amp; Golden Land S/T,  Zombie Necronize. You can also use it to recover Eldlich &amp; Balerdroch incase your opponent banishes them."

Stay tuned for updates if any. Thank you :),"Desk is pretty simple to use.  Main objective is to get 2 monsters on the field (such as Rod and Souls) or the sky striker 1 card combo to make Predaplant Verte Anaconda then pay 2000 LP summon Dragoon, win the game. *Eagle Booster is to make them unable to negate Verte.*  The True Name is easy to use if you combo it with Circle or Servant then free Obelisk for a turn. Link him off after battle phase.  If you have Illusion of Chaos and rites in your hand then search Sauravis for a hand negate.  If all else fails just Skill Drain Torrential and recurring beat with DM. EZ.  Game 2: Side in whatever you need to to hard counter them"

I've been playing Skull Servants since 2014 on and off, and started bringing it to locals over the past year, so I'm very familiar with the core engine. This deck is made to be pure Skulls, and I'm sure a variant on this deck that runs Zombie World, Balerdoch, and Necroworld Banshee is probably more consistent, this is a more off-meta version. With that being said, let's break it down the cards, and look at some combos:  <strong><span>Skull Servant Core:</span></strong>  3x <strong>Wightbaking:</strong> This is the most important card in our deck, it must be at 3, and we want to be opening it in our hand at all times. Its only down-side is that the effect is once-per-turn, so we want to try and play around some negates before we commit to sending this to graveyard. Depending on our opening hand, typically we can summon Baking and link it off to send it to grave, and complete our full combo by adding Wightprince and Wightmare, then discarding Wightmare. Keep in mind that this card specifies that you add 2 cards to hand then discard 1 - you do not have to discard one of the cards added (though most time we do), we can discard any 1 from hand. We can also discard this from hand with Uni-Zombie, and if this gets negated, we'll be able to discard it on our opponents turn when he attempts to destroy Uni-Zombie. The protection effect this card also offers to all our level 3 or lower zombies is a huge bonus, as it can keep our King + Lady boards safe. In an ideal world, we can discard 1 from the deck and keep another in our hand to protect our King on board. This is the easy MVP of the deck.  2x <strong>Wightprince: </strong>The second most important card to this combo. Sending this to grave is our priority on turn 1, as it sends two Garnets from our deck and lets us special summon King. This is a good opener in hand as well: we can play the game when we open Baking, Prince, or Uni-Zombie. By opening either Prince or Baking in hand in addition to Uni-Zombie, it allows to send both, which gives us our best opening line. I run this, the vanilla Skull Servant and Lady each at 2 because they're too cloggy at 3 and sending all 3 I think is just win-more. You could put this at 3 and leave the garnets at 2 but the 3rd becomes a brick pretty quickly, so I think that's suboptimal. Wightprince's second effect is two banish itself + two skull servants to special summon King from the deck. If you've sent two princes on the same turn, I reccomend banishing two Lady in Wights for this effect, as we can special summon them with Wightprince, but we can't special summon the vanilla unfortunately. Being able to special summon the Lady's is nice for our extended combos.  <b>3x Wightmare: </b>The third most important card to the combo. The ability to summon a banished King or Lady is integral to our combos. The King is simply a beater without his Lady next to him, and the only way we’re putting Lady on the board face up is with Wightmare’s effect. I think this should be run at 3 because we can resolve 3 fairly easily, but because we add it to hand with baking, I can see an argument for putting it to two.  <span>2</span>x <strong>King of the Skull Servants</strong>: Our boss monster. We run him at 2 because we don't want to draw it, we always want to special it off of Prince's effect. We can't special summon him with Prince's effect if he is in the hand, as Prince's effect only summons from deck, so its typically not a very good draw. Getting King + Lady on the field protects him from destruction from battle, and the effects of spells and traps, so he is surprisingly difficult to out, which is the fun of playing this deck. If you full combo turn 1, King can hit 7,000 attack turn 1 pretty easily.  2x <strong>Lady in Wight</strong> is another important combo piece. Lady protects all our level 3 or lower zombies from the effects of spells and traps, and we can special summon her from the banished zone with the effect of Wightprince, making her a valuable piece to any board we set up. We don't want to draw into this though, so we keep it at 2.  2x <strong>Skull Servant</strong>: The boy himself. Absolutely never want to draw him, so we keep it at 2 to resolve Wightprince's effect twice. That's all we need him for.  <strong>Other Zombie Support:</strong>  3x <strong>Jack-o-Bolan: </strong>I love this card, I've been playing around with the ratios for a while now. Opening this card with a prince or baking lets us dump them without committing our summon, and this deck really needs that: in my experience playing, getting negated after our normal summon really holds us back. His effect to special a zombie to our field on our opponents main phase is a useful way to tag into Lady when necessary if we don't have her on our end board. His 7 levels make him an option for level 10 synchros as well: I haven't added one to this build yet, but I recommend looking into what level 10 synchros you could add to this deck (I'm thinking Baronne de Fleur). Additionally, this card is also a good target for Avendread Saviour, which we'll touch on later. I think 2x is the minimum for this, 3 could be a bit bricky so you can adjust as you see fit.  3x <strong>Uni-Zombie</strong> is a must at 3 as well. It's the third card in here we're happy to open. I prefer to have baking or prince because one Veiler and our turn is over, but that is the pit-fall of this deck as a whole. Getting to send from the deck is exactly what this deck wants, and he sets it up easily, and we can full combo from there. I previously ran an additional 3 copies of <strong>Shiranui Solitaire</strong> as a way to special summon Uni-Zombie, but I don't like being left with a completely empty board when Solitaire is negated, so I cut them. As noted above, if Uni-Zombie does get negated, our turn is basically done but if we have a Baking in hand, it gives us at least something on our opponents turn.  1x <strong>Mezuki: </strong>Mezuki is a great extender - if we don't need to dump a combo piece from deck with Uni-Zombie, we can dump this instead to bring a card back for extending our combos. It's very nice to be able to dump, but we only need 1 copy in my opinion, we aren't recycling cards that often, plus Wightmare allows to do the same from the Banish pile.  <strong><span>Extras:</span></strong>  1x <strong>Destrudo: </strong>Fresh off the banlist, this card is cracked, very much worth running. We can get in grave easily, and search it off Halq too. Worth trying out.  1x <strong>Pankertops: </strong>We're happy going second, and this is a nice piece going 2nd as well. Our end-board is typically just 2 monsters so there's plenty opportunity to summon this vs meta decks.  <strong><span>Hand-Traps</span></strong>  3x <strong>Ash Blossom: </strong>needs no introduction, pretty much mandatory. All the ghost girls have nice utility as level 3 zombies in here as well, so its good to keep in mind.  3x <strong>Nibiru: </strong>this deck gets killed by combo players that can set up huge boards with negates and such, so I think we have to run 3 Nibiru in main to shut that down.  3x <strong>Impermanence: </strong>like Ash, needs no introduction. A nice piece of interruption, we don't want to let our opponents get set up.  Like always with hand traps, it depends what you're playing into. If you'd rather run Belle, Ghost Ogre, DD Crow, Droll, Veiler, etc that's your call. I previously ran Veiler in this build as a searchable level 1 tuner with Halqifibrax with the ability to synchro with Jack-o-Bolan but it didn't come up super often.  <strong><span>Spells and Traps</span></strong>  1x <strong>Foolish Burial: </strong>Best card in our deck, wish we could have more than 1. Starts our combos.  1x <strong>One for One: </strong>Another great starter piece for us, also limited to 1. Also starts our combos.  1x <strong>Monster Reborn: </strong>great extender if we send 1 Wightprince, we can reborn it and link it back to the grave and get the effect again as its not once per turn. Allows us to re-start combos with our grave if we top-deck it too. Would love more than 1 of this too.  1x <strong>Called by the Grave: </strong>Also limited to 1, great interruption, always feels like a game-winner to pull this  3x <strong>Where arf thou: </strong>Very nice extender. After sending Prince and special summoning King, we can activate this and normal summon to avoid the cost if we want. We're mostly fine with paying the cost if necessary though. Alternatively, if we can make our regular board already, use this to add Wightbaking at the end of turn to protect your King and Lady on your opponents turn – its well worth the 2000 life points.  1x <strong>Burial From a Different Dimension: </strong>We banish 3 to Special King. This returns 3 to the grave. Self explanatory I think. I've run this at 2 and 3, but its bricky at 3. You could run this at 2, but I'm happy with 1. Don’t forget to special summon Lady with Wightmare before activating this if you haven’t got her on board.  <b><span>Extra Deck:</span></b>  1x <b>Linkuriboh </b>and <b>Salamangreat Almiraj </b>serve the same purpose as link fodder to send a baking or prince off our board to open a combo. Use Linkuriboh in your King + Lady lines for one added line of protection. Use Almiraj if you’re planning to make Accesscode so you’ll have the fire attribute for his effect and you’re not making Phoenix, as Unicorn will give you the Dark attribute already.  1x <b>Avendread Saviour </b>gives us another way to discard from the deck, so we can make this reasonably often. Having 3 level 7 zombies in the deck gives us a little more utility to this effect too for clearing boards.  1x <b>Vampire Sucker</b>: we can make this along a combo chain to draw a card as we’re summoning. The second effect of summoning from our opponents grave to their field is an underrated tool to bust up potential combos our opponents is setting up later than turn 1.  1x <b>Knightmare Phoenix and Unicorn – </b>need no introduction I think, they can go in any extra deck, and are basically mandatory for going into Accesscode.  1x <b>Masquerena </b>– Interruption for our opponents turn to go into Unicorn.  1x <b>Halqifibrax </b>– Great extender that we make with Uni-zombie fairly often, opens us up to Link 4s easily.  1x <b>Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess </b>– the best interruption we can make. Great end board card for our turn 1s, but we should look to make 4 negates where we can.  <strong><span>How to play Skull Servants:</span></strong>  This deck is very simple to play, we don't vary off of our main line too often. Our end board can typically be Apollusa and Omega if we want, or finish on King/Lady and other pieces.  <strong>The basic line:</strong>  Our basic combo is as follows: Send Wightbaking to grave (the two ways we commonly accomplish this is 1) normal Baking and Link-1, or 2) effect of Uni-Zombie, but foolish burial and one for one can get us there too). We then add Wightprince and Wightmare to hand, and discard Prince. -&gt; Prince effect to send a skull servant and Lady in Wight -&gt; Prince 2nd effect to Special Summon <strong>King of the Skull Servants</strong>. -&gt; Send Wightmare from hand to Special Summon Lady in Wight. Now we have King at 2k and protected by Lady.  <strong>extended line:</strong>  our extended line is any line that pitches both Wightprinces. We can do this pretty easily by opening Prince or Baking in hand, and anything that lets us send it from the hand: One for One, Uni-Zombie, Jack-o-Bolan all give us this. Where Are Thou also lets us add one if we didn't open one in hand. In this line, we usually want to <em>send Wightprince first, and Baking second</em><strong><i> </i></strong>to scout Ash, as we prefer Baking to resolve. We also want to send both Princes before Special Summoning King if we can. If we do so, it allows to banish both Lady's from grave and special them both if we opened with a Wightmare (in addition to adding one with Baking effect). Always keep in mind that Wightbaking is a once-per-turn effect, but Wightprince is not – if Baking is negated by Ash, we can’t send a second copy that same turn.  <strong>full combo (god-hand opening):</strong>  In terms of full combo, the biggest board we can finish on turn 1 is a King at 4k, an Apollusa with 4 negates and Psy Framelord Omega. A line that lets us do this requires Prince/Baking in hand with Jack-o-Bolan, Uni-Zombie as our normal summon, another way to send a prince, and Reborn or Foolish. We can make this board by pitching Baking to Special Jack-o-Bolan, complete our basic combo with Baking effect, and send our 2nd Prince. Special Lady with Wightmare, and you have a board of Jack, King, and Lady with no summon committed yet. We can normal Uni-Zombie and use effect to pitch Mezuki, Reborn Mezuki, synchro into Omega with Uni-Zombie and Mezuki. Use Mezuki to bring back a Lady and link-4 the remaining monsters to make Apollusa. Finally, you can activate your 2nd prince in grave and pitch both Ladys to finish with a King on board as well. In my experience, this is the biggest board we can make going first with the cards in this deck list. Depending on what you’re playing into, this kind of hand gives you endless options for what to do with your turn.  <b>King and Lady on board vs Extra deck monsters?</b>  One scenario you’ll face pretty often with this deck is you’ll have King + Lady on board as special summons, and likely one other piece (a linkuriboh or a Uni-Zombie that started your combo). With Uni-Zombie and Lady you’ll have the option to go into a Synchro 8 if you used both Uni effects, or link 2 into Halqifibrax and go into Apollusa from there. I’ve gone back and forth on what I think is better, but at the moment I think I prefer setting up King/ Lady and pass than making Omega or Apo with 3 negates. A big plus to finishing on King/Lady is if we can keep a Wightbaking in hand with this board – it gives full protection to an attempt to pop King or Lady from the board, and lets us resolve baking’s effect again on our opponents turn. In this scenario, they’ll have to commit further resources to removing King, and if we aren’t OTK’d, we’ll be able to make another King/Lady board on our next turn.  <strong><span>Shorter/Alternative</span></strong><span> <strong>lines:</strong></span>  In my opinion, these going-first boards are fine, and we're happy to make them into combo decks, but we need a good opening hand. My feeling is that we're better off going second if we're not playing into an opponent setting up negates. A lot of our lines on turn 2 lead us into making Abyss Dweller (and into Zeus from there if we want).  If we’re going 2nd and we have a weak hand but we can muster 2 summons, we can make Avendread Savior and attack into our opponent to dump a prince or baking. Avendread is a good utility summon for this reason, and he’s also good because we can dump Jack-O-Bolan to decrease an opponents attack by 1400. This line doesn’t feel great but if we dump Baking from Avendread, we can set up our King + Lady in Main Phase 2 at least.  With <b>Destrudo,</b> I haven’t gotten a physical copy to test out combos with this, but it definitely adds a lot of options to our turns.  <b><span>Upgrades and Changes to this deck</span></b>  <b><span>Main Deck:</span></b>  <b>Shiranui Solitaire: </b>I previously ran this at 3. It’s 3 more chances to draw into Uni-Zombie and begin your combo, but I took it out simply because if this effect is negated after tributing itself for cost, you are left with an empty board. If you wanted to run this, I’d suggest running a heavier hand trap/trap ratio in the deck, and particularly adding Gamma and Driver into main as an option on your opponents turn to prevent an OTK. I could see this at 1 copy in the deck as a small consistency boost, but I don’t like to rely on it.  <b>Wightprincess: </b>The one monster from the archtype we’re not running: the effect of spending our normal summon to pitch Wightprince was nice at the time it was released, but its way too slow of a card to run now, and is functionally a weaker version of Baking. Being level 3 and 1600 attack, we can’t make a link-1 with this either. You could run this at 1, as the hand-trap effect to reduce the attack of all monsters is good in niche scenarios, but I don’t think that’s enough to warrant putting it into the main. Another reason to run this is that its another “Skull Servant” name that can be searched off Baking, so you get some utility from that. I don’t see room for it, but you can give consideration to adding 1.  <b>Mathematician: </b>This was a core card in the deck once upon a time, but we don’t run it now. You could certainly run 1 copy as a potential opener, but its completely dead to a hand trap at the cost of your normal summon, and the draw effect is unlikely to resolve too.  <b>Allure of Darkness: </b>I just recently cut this, but you could find room for 1 or 2 copies for the draw power. My issue is that after we do our opening combo, there aren’t a lot of good DARK targets left to discard in the deck. We run 15 DARKs, but a Uni-Zombie opening combo will use up 7 of them at least, so we’ll discarding our hand pretty often.  <b>Crush Card, Deck Devastator, Eradicator Epidemic Virus: </b>All the virus cards are live with this deck thanks to King. They’re an interesting tech option for certain matchups: the added “look at your opponents hand” is a huge plus and you can discard a lot of cards off this. However, running them in main is a crap shoot, and if you’re playing a deck that wants to be discarding cards like we do, you’re in big trouble.  <b><span>Extra Deck:</span></b>  1x <b>Baronne De Fleur </b>is a very pricey card, but would undoubtedly be incredibly strong in this deck, as he is in many others. This deck would love a level 10 Synchro and Baronne is the best of the bunch. The reason we love a level 10 is because we have Jack-o-Bolan at level 7, and we have six tuners (3 Ash and 3 Uni-Zombie) that are level 3 to make Baronne easily. If you have the cash, put this in, and take Scarlight out.  1x <b>Relinquished Anima</b> is a good alternative at link 1, its your preference in that category.  1x <b>Coral Dragon</b> is a level 6 synchro I used to run in this deck, its very good, I only cut it for space. Lady in Wight + either tuner in the deck make this easily, and its ability to discard 1 is always something we like in the deck to start combos. If there’s card in this extra deck you don’t like, this is something you can sub in with ease.  1x <b>Trishula </b>has been cut from this deck for space too, but it’s a nice option going second. If you alter this build to be more oriented to going second, consider adding it back in. At level 9 + 3 materials required, it’s a little steep, but its easily made with Uni-Zombie (after resolving both his effects), Lady + King as materials.  1x <b>Clear Wing Synchro Dragon </b>is a great generic level 7 synchro, we make it easily with Uni-Zombie + Lady, and the effect is very good. When I ran it, I almost never made it though, so I cut it for that reason.  <b>Rank 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 XYZs: </b>Uni-Zombie’s ability to boost its own level plus Lady’s level means the door is open to any Rank 3 or 4s: if you summon two level 1 monsters, Uni-Zombie could boost them both to level 2 for rank 2s as well, though this is a much less likely occurrence. There’s a huge selection of XYZ monsters to select from, so its worth your time having a look, particularly Rank 4s. I settled on Dweller and Nightingale as my 2 XYZs for getting to Zeus, but other XYZ monsters I’ve rotated in and out include:  1x <b>Break Sword</b>: A 2k beater that can pop a card from your opponents field if necessary, it’s a nice card for transitioning into Zeus with added utility from its effect. This could easily fit right in this deck.  1x <b>Leviair the Sea Dragon: </b>used to feature in this deck. Really good, but when I want to make an XYZ, I lean to a preference to Dweller, but Leviair is a great fit too.  1x <b>Castel the Skyblaster: </b>I love Castel so much, I put him back in every so often, he’s the 16th extra deck monster of this deck for me. 2k attack makes him a great Zeus buffer, and his effect to book-of-moon something so you can essentially attack for free makes him a great option.  1x <b>Downerd Magician: </b>No explanation needed really, one extra material for Zeus. I don’t see room for this but if you want to play more towards Zeus turbo, slide it in.  1x <b>Sylvan Princessprite: </b>A good option for a rank 1 – detaching a material is a good way to put 1 card in the graveyard, and the effect of excavating one benefits us a lot of the time, whether we add a spell or send a monster to the grave. I have run this, but I prefer Nightingale for making Zeus.  <b><span>Strengths and Weaknesses:</span></b>  <b>Strength – Big Number go brrr: </b>Even against meta decks, you’ll be surprised with how often 5,000 attack and cannot be destroyed by battle becomes a difficult obstacle, especially with Lady on the field, and a Baking in hand. Additionally, our King can push 10k off of full combo, so an OTK is in our reach as well, so we can upset meta decks if they brick an opening hand  <b>Strength – low summon count: </b>Unless we want to make the full Apollusa combo, our standard King + Lady summon combo will cost us 4 summons, so we dodge Nibiru quite comfortably.  <b>Weakness – consistency: </b>the Lady in Wight’s and Skull Servant’s are basically 4 garnets in this deck, and the Wightmares are only extenders, not openers, so we brick quite a lot. Running up to 15 hand traps may be a better alternative approach to this deck to help survive, because there aren’t more engine cards to include, except maybe a 3rd copy of Wightprince, which itself becomes a brick if we combo successfully.  <b>Weakness – Negates: </b>We can’t play through negates, that’s all there is to say. If we get Ashed or Impermed or Veilered on our opening move, we’re toast pretty often. If our opponent sets up Apollusa or anything that negates effects on their turn, we’re not getting off the ground.  <b>Weakness – Negates of our own: </b>Baronne would help with this, but we equally don’t set up enough negates of our own. I added Apollusa to help this, but it takes a big combo to make 4 negates with her. Consider adding more interruption to this deck to overcome this. Combo decks can really play through us with relative ease in my experience.  <b><span>Conclusion</span></b>  Skull Servants are a super fun deck, and I absolutely love them. They’re not tier 1 by any means, but I have fun with them at locals for the most part. I feel like a smarter player than me could find ways to make this more consistent: in particular, we’re really craving more ways to special summon or send from the deck, so our opening turn doesn’t get shut out by negates so easily. That said, if you can make a board, you’ll win plenty of games.  So that’s it! If you have any thoughts or suggestions for the deck, I’d love to hear, as I’m always looking for improvements to make. For starters I’ll need to experiment with Zombie World in here, but I’d love to hear more builds for a pure Skull Servant deck.  If you read this all the way to the end, thank you so much for reading!"

Deck is based on: cards which greatly devastate the opponent's deck, discard (even all cards in opponent hand) and disturbing the opponent at every turn HF ;)  Mysterune archetyp IMO will quickly join to Meta decks  (combined, of course, with other archetypes). As long as he doesn't get hurt too much through the next banlists. I've already tested him well and it definitely has a lot of potential. That's why I decided to do a short Mysterune decks series.  So far I have created one more foolproof Mysterune deck, <strong>which I will present on Friday, February 25</strong>. There is more negates in the next deck and more use of monsters from the Extra deck. If people like it I'll make more decks with this archetyp.  I saw that initially this archetype was very popular in Edo (right after the premiere), but perhaps the unsuccessful attempts to create something unfailing discouraged people. I will be happy if I can show you new ways to make meaningful use of the Mysterune archetype.  &nbsp;  Ok, now let's move on to the description of the deck (because not everything is as obvious as it seems). <ol>  	<li>The first words on each Mysterune card  ""Activate 1 of these effects; skip your next Battle Phase after this card resolves."" It's obvious we won't be attacking too much in this deck ( in next we will attack more and even we will possess OTK) . Therefore, it is very important to start Battle Phase, then is considered to be skip, this is very important if we want to attack later.</li>  	<li>""Spring of the Mysterune"" it is the most important card in this archetype, And I assure you that we will not run out of this card in my decks ( without Planet Pathfinder, Demise of the Land and without other unnecessary things). But that's not the most important thing here. It is most important to use this card with moderation. Not try to draw three cards over and over again, by throwing cards that will surely be useful in the next round (for example ""Mysterune of the Freezing Curse""). Usually, the optimal number of cards to be draw is two. Let's not be too greedy and remember that: in the next round we will also draw cards. <strong>One more important thing here</strong>. if we have in hand ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" we should make sure that we draws cards faster, before your opponent start adds hiss cards, so as not to be stopped by your own effect.</li>  	<li>""Nibiru, the Primal Being"" this card will not be useful against some decks, but I decided to use it because the biggest threat to Mysterune are combo decks. At worst, we can use Nibiru with effect ""Muninn, Wings of the Mysterune"".</li>  	<li>""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" What can I say, this card has stopped many decks and sometimes completely paralyzed the opponent.  Especially useful when  opponent starts the game.  But in this case it has a  second special meaning. Because we can use him in a combo with one or two other cards to banish all cards in opponent hand. <strong>And in most cases it means almost instant win.</strong></li>  	<li>""Mysterune of Dispel"" remember that this card can only be used immediately after ""add"" effect resolves.</li>  	<li>This deck will require skillful juggling of the Field cards, and sometimes also use ""Mysterune of Destruction"". The deck takes a bit of practice but then gives a lot.</li> </ol> <strong>Tips and tricks:</strong>  Use ""Mysterune of the Golden Droplets"" in a combo with ""Mysterune of Dispel"" and, if possible with ""Deceit of the Mysterune"" (but not at any cost) to maximize damage to your opponent's deck.  To draw more cards with an effect ""Spring of the Mysterune"" use Mysterune Quick-Play Spell, special summon ""Muninn, Wings of the Mysterune"" and discard 1 Mysterune Quick-Play Spell in chain link 1, chain link 2 use ""Spring of the Mysterune"", then you will draw one additional card (attention, use common sense - same as above in the second point).  And probably the most anticipated - <strong>discard  all cards in opponent hand combo. </strong>  For this we can use basically 2 cards ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" and ""Trickstar Reincarnation"". With this setting, we wait for the opponent to add a card from the deck by himself  (we are waiting for the effect resolves) and then we use ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" in chain link 1 and ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" in chain link 2 - that's all ;)  <strong>Ok, but if  opponent will not add anything ?</strong> No problem here, we can use 3 card combo. For this we can use ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird""  and 2 copie ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" or ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" and 1 ""Mysterune of the Golden Droplets"" and 1 ""Trickstar Reincarnation"".  We are using ""Mysterune of the Golden Droplets"" or first copie ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" (we are waiting for the effect resolves) and then we use ""Trickstar Reincarnation"" in chain link 1 and ""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"" in chain link 2 - simple.  <strong>One important thing, combo will not work during Draw Phase, and you must remember about this HF.</strong>  &nbsp;  My other decks 2022:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/drytron-perfection-2022/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/drytron-perfection-2022/</a>  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/abc-dragon-buster-deck-2022/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/abc-dragon-buster-deck-2022/</a>  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-control-deck-2022/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/invoked-dogmatika-control-deck-2022/</a>  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/cyber-dragon-2022-2/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/cyber-dragon-2022-2/</a>"

This deck basically works by summoning 2 level 8 Geminis with catalyst field to go into rank 8 plays (Mostly some mix of Draglubion, Hope Harbringer, and Numeron Dragon) and supporting those rank 8s with trap cards.  If you have to go second then you have a full side deck full of board breakers that can just replace all of your traps.  This deck is bad btw.  Edit 1: I replaces Called by The Grave with an extra copy of Lost Wind because it turns that this deck actually dodges most hand traps except probably Ghost Belle and PSY-framegear Gamma (which dodges Called by anyway) and Lost Wind seems to be a slightly more valuable set in my opinion.  Also if you want to play this in Master Duel, most of the gem cost is in the Extra Deck and there are a lot of useless cards in there.  The necessary Extra Deck cards are at least 1 Draglubion, 1 Hope Harbringer, 1 Numeron Dragon, and at least 2 more Dragon Number Monsters that aren't Draglubion (as long as both aren't Hope or Numeron)."

There are 3 main basic combos:  - pa/ma and solar: normal summon pa/ma, activate its effects to normal summon solar, activate solars effects to send rai-oh to the gy, link pa/ma and solar into summoner and pass. During your opponent turn, activate summoner effect to special summon rai-oh from gy.  - pa/ma and bro: normal summon pa/ma, activate its effect to normal summon Bro, activate Bro effect to search rai-oh, link pa/ma and bro into summoner and pass. During your opponent turn, activate summoner effect by discarding rai-oh from your hand and special summon it from gy (this Works because you Will have thunder monsters previously in your gy by the time you discard rai-oh).  - Photo sanctuary and rai-oh: activate photon sanctuary to special summon 2 tokens, link the tokens into summoner, normal summon rai-oh. You Will already have rai-oh onvthe field, but If you use its Second effect, you can revive him with summoner by discard a card, during your opponent turn.  &nbsp;  This deck is a midrange deck that can both go first and second, his going First can be strange against a deck that are ficcused on breaking boards and its going second can be akward against decks that have multiples negates like 4+ negates. Overral its a balanced deck. Also the ratio of the quantitiesbof monsters, spells and traps being like that was made on purpose, só If the opponent Lock onde type of card, ill have other 2 to Work with. And each type of card have a main function: monsters are the main engine, spells are utility (extenders, draw and recycle), and traps are defenses (going First and going second defenses). The extradeck se have summoner, super Poly targets and some toolbox options that do have any major conflict with the other cards in the deck."
