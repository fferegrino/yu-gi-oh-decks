Youll see a couple of choices I made in the deck but it has his reasons like the dark rule no more you can use that going second if you lose the dice roll that's no problem you can top deck or have dark ruler no more in your hand so you're always capable of breaking a board if needed if they don't have any blowout cards like judgment or whatever but if you go first and you have a dark no more in your hand that's not a big of a deal because you can 1 draw and put back dark ruler no more with ferijjit effect or you keep it in hand just in case if you're playing against a FTK deck. You have something that can help you break the board if you survive  the turn  I'm playing the trap build because trap cards are amazing I love trap cards that's why I'm playing the trap cards I'm playing three trap cards I'm not counting the impermanence as a trap card more like a hand trap because impermanence is very good right now in the format but you can use it in your hand so it's like a pseudo effect veiler but a better effect further  I'm playing needle ceiling just to counter combo decks and ftk that they can produce a lot of summons a lot of monsters on the field there is there is a condition to needle ceeling but there is a condition to torrential as well. Yes you don't need to summon something and then avoid being TT’d but not a lot of people are expecting needle ceiling and a lot of people want to break boards and want to summon as much monsters as  they can and needle ceiling regards your own field so if you have two monsters they only need two monsters on their field you can also use that benifically against dino because NC doesn’t send face down monsters and your monsters have grave effects that wont lose timing. so there's an upside and downside to using that I love the card I've been testing against Dinos and drytron and it's it's very impactful against Dino because the misc protection effect doesn't protect in the battle phase so in the battle phase: needle ceiling and then break boards.  I'm also playing ice dragon prison because I dragon prison is a very good car to use banishing a monster way it's pretty good banishing tool is even better going into your second match you'll probably get lancia so your eyes are in prison will be unaffected against dry trans or something like that it's also not that great so UN contemplating if I want to replace the Azure in prison with hand traps such as droll and lock bird.  3x revolt just a great card in general he can plus, it can add cards to your hand and it can interrupt your opponent so I'm playing it at three if you open up revolt it doesn't matter at all you don't need to go into bearbloom you can go into ferijjit draw one card put there put the revolt back in if you draw two that's also fine you can stack your graveyard leave it at that go into farji make your hand better and then put the revolt that allows you also to play around nebiru more because you don't need the extra summon of bearbrumm and it won’t lock you into tri brigade when you use her effect to search revolt so revolt at three is the way to go in my opinion  To top off the trap cards i have solemn strikes uhm strike doesn't need any explanation it's very good trap card counter trap card yeah that's about it.  &nbsp;  The extra deck is kind of standard everything you will see in every other deck it's like a staple extra deck maybe you can switch around the doom eagle for a second rugal for the access code play synergizing with the revolt or simply a third shuraig but it won't come up so yeah the doom eagle is just a good interruption in your opponent's turn or just a FTK card."

Most likely 3x Swap Frog 1x Ronintoadin instead of the Mermails, or reduction of Unexpected Dai. One copy of Transmodify can be replaced with Downbeat if you want Transmodify to brick less, but Downbeat only works well on Retort Fusion/Roaring Ocean Snake into The Great Emperor Penguin unless you also run the frogs. I originally considered Genex Undine and Crystron Rosenix, but you cannot use Skull Dread or Link Spider or Genex Controller in the all WATER variant that Ice Barrier / Ice Knight / Silent Sea Nettle forces.  Foolish Burial Goods sends Ice Barrier which lets you send then retrieve The Great Emperor Penguin. Aqua Spirit, Ice Knight, Unexpected Dai, Mermail Abyssteus, Instant Fusion and Retort Fusion can provide a tribute for TGEP without using your normal summon.  TGEP goes into Glacial Beast Polar Penguin and Nopenguin, which make Penguin Brave (Polar Penguin will also banish a card on summon at this point due to Nopenguin). Penguin Brave sets Penguin Soldier or Nightmare Penguin from your deck which triggers Nopenguin to revive itself. With one additional monster you can use it and Nopenguin to make Marincess Coral Anemone, which revives a discarded Barrier Statue, or a material for Stealth Kragen, or Glacial Beast Polar Penguin to act as a tuner for another Synchro.  Penguin Brave can flip Penguin Soldier up on the opponent's turn, which will also trigger Nopenguin to revive again, so it's free to use Nopenguin as materials for something and not keep it around on your turn.  A decent common end board is Penguin Brave, Stealth Kragen, Penguin Soldier (set) and usually Marincess Coral Anemone or Mistar Boy, potentially with Barrier Statue of the Torrent, and Nopenguin auto-revíves when you trigger Brave. At minimum you have Penguin Brave Penguin Soldier and Stealth Kragen so that's at least 2 monsters banished and 1 destroyed -- with Barrier Statue and either Stealth Kragen or Penguin Brave on field you can sort of bottleneck a non-WATER opponent with only one summon that will get destroyed or banished."

Not only is <strong>Cipher Biplane</strong> a soft OPT, it can summon itself and it can search a <strong>Cipher</strong> monster on destruction. This deck aims to blind second and pick apart your opponent's board by using their monsters for your plays.</span>  <span>3 <strong>Ash</strong> and 3 <strong>Belle</strong> since this deck's engine is really small so you can fit a lot of handtraps to for going second. 3 <strong>Cipher Biplane</strong> which is just insane especially being a soft OPT on the level modulation. 3 <strong>Cipher Twin Raptor</strong> which is pretty much your only normal summon for the deck if you don't meet its special summon requirements. It also summons any <strong>Cipher</strong> from deck which gets you to<strong> Biplane</strong>. 3 <strong>Cipher Wing</strong> which is a free special summon. 3 <strong>Cipher Entranger</strong>. It may not seem the best, but it is the best discard fodder for <strong>Raptor</strong> and it searches a Spell/Trap. 1 <strong>Cipher Mirror Knight</strong> which is just discard fodder and it sets your hand for next turn.</span>  <span>Spells/Traps: <strong>One for One</strong>. 3 <strong>Prosperity</strong> which you can actually cut down to maybe 1 or 2 in order to play something that just gives the deck a higher ceiling like <strong>Avarice</strong> to recycle. 3 <strong>Double Exposure</strong> for Rank 8 plays. 3 <strong>Droplet</strong>. 3 <strong>Odd-Eyes Fusion</strong> which sets up your blowout<strong> X Dragon</strong> play. 1 <strong>RUM Cipher Ascension</strong> since <strong>Neo Cipher</strong> is just a house. 3 <strong>Imperm</strong>. 3 <strong>Cipher Spectrum</strong> which gives you somewhat of a greater reason to play <strong>Avarice</strong> since you are just burning through your copies of og <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong> each turn. 1 <strong>Cipher Bit</strong> which prevents destruction of 1 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes</strong>/<strong>Cipher</strong> Xyz.</span>  <span>Extra Deck. 1 <strong>Borreload Furious</strong> and 1<strong> Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</strong> as your <strong>Odd-Eyes Fusion</strong> targets. 1 <strong>Zeus</strong>. 3 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</strong> which extends your plays using your opponent's stolen monsters. 1 <strong>Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong> which can detach ""UP TO 3"" to steal the same amount of monsters who can also be ranked-up into<strong> X Dragon</strong>. 2 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon</strong> which you can rank-up into if you happen to steal an xyz monster and it pops 1. 1 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</strong> which pops 1 and floats. 3 og <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong>. Finally, 1 <strong>Odd-Eyes Rebellion</strong> and 1 <strong>Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon</strong>. I got this idea from an <span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/AxEgtKjj8oQ"">OCG duel</a> <span>where you would send <strong>Raging</strong> and <strong>Rebellion</strong> off of<strong> Odd-Eyes Fusion</strong> and then you would use 1 or 2 of your <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragons</strong> that have survived until your next turn or that is summoned from <strong>Cipher Spectrum</strong> to return <strong>Raging</strong> and <strong>Rebellion</strong> to the ED and summon them using your <strong>X Dragons</strong>. Now you have 2 board wipes. You also have up to 5 attacks between the two of them but the board wipe is the more important pay-off of this.</span></span></span>  <span>Side Deck. There are a lot of Traps so you can go first. This deck does not have any turn 1 plays and you can't make a<strong> Hope Harbinger</strong> either since <strong>Cipher Twin Raptor</strong> xenolocks you. We also have <strong>Nibiru</strong> and<strong> Twin Twisters</strong> for those match-ups. 3<strong> Cosmos Channelling</strong> which is a neat tech card. If you run out of <strong>X Dragons</strong> to rank-up your stolen monsters into, this card sends the stolen monster to grave to summon 1 machine from hand or grave. <strong>Twin Raptor</strong> and <strong>Biplane</strong> are machines so you can further extend your plays if you wanted to.</span>"

It motivates me to play them more. For fun... I already have a meta deck (BBWs) and casual (Rikka) deck.  This War Rock setup is still clunky, but I'm seeing improved and smoother gameplay. Different than the few deck profiles I found around the intraweb and uuutube.  I'm weighing my cards into playing defensive Turn 1. So, that is why you are seeing mostly 1 of on most cards. Working on improving Barrier Statue Turn 1. Currently it is not that consistent. I know its cheesy but I find it being a very necessary evil to force your opponent to address; they will have to ADDRESS it.  Extravagance: Extra Deck is not super necessary. Most good targets will conflict with War Rock Mountain. Dante, hilarious can be played with War Rock and can be protected by War Rock Mountain. #cough Marauding Captain.  Marauding Captain can bring out Barrier(emphasis on Main Phase 2) or Fortia on its own Normal Summon. With Gactos, Special Summoning itself.  Book of Lunar Eclipse. Meteoragon can attack both face-down targets while negating effects during the battle phase WHEN it attacks then for the rest of the turn.  Solemn Strike,SS3, for the Monsters.

If you're lucky, you can also get the drytron counter trap into that, but that plus everything else isn't going to happen all of the time. There are a few ways of going about your main strategy, but the key point is benten adds Vanity's Ruler, so you need to make sure you can add draconids to the hand if you don't have it. Mu Beta is great for getting you the right pieces you need, if you didn't draw them.  Chaos MAX and Quadrantids are great for turn two or following up. The extra deck is mostly and emergency options list. Dark Ruler no more is the worst thing to happen to this deck, although Nibiru isn't fun either, so watch out for those.  As for some other things, diviner of the herald is not present in this deck, because she costs an absolutely insane amount right now. This is a deck I am actually using, and $75 dollars a card is too rich for my blood. Manju does essentially the same thing, he's just not as flexible. Swap him out if you want. ZEUS is missing for a similar reason, but he would be cool to have if I was a little mmmmm richer."

In the French ""The Last Mercenary"", he plays a former intelligence agent, who must return home to France when his son is accused of drug and arms trafficking. <a>https://wrathofmanfilmy.wildapricot.org/</a>  - It is an incredibly exciting project that allows me to try a new genre. I hope to take the action comedy torch in my own way. David Charhon has written a script that connects a beautiful and emotional story with lots of action and humor, comments the now 60-year-old van Damme. <a>https://thejourneyanime.wildapricot.org/</a>  Since 2002, Insomniac Games has taken us on both humorous, action-packed and colorful space adventures with the pocket watch Ratchet and the robot Clank in countless games. <a>https://krudsnovodoba.wildapricot.org/</a>  For a while, the series actually felt a bit worn out and there was a risk that ""Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart"" would also feel repetitive (which is the sixteenth part of the series). However, you do not have to worry about that, as it is an almost bloated gaming experience that was offered. <a>https://lucafilmovi.wildapricot.org/</a>  The adventure begins with our duo paying tribute to their many heroic deeds during a festival, where, however, everything goes completely wrong very quickly. A so-called Dimensionator that Clank had intended to give his friend as a present, so that he could look for his missing race in another dimension, is instead stolen by the villain Dr Nefarious. <a>http://community.gtarcade.com/thread/1358357-1-1.html</a>  He accidentally opens portals to a variety of dimensions, which take all three of them to an alternative universe where his even more powerful counterpart reigns.  The two heroes separate and Clank meets the lombax Rivet, who leads a resistance group against the evil emperor. Together, they must work together to stop Nefarious and prevent the evil robots from collapsing the entire multiverse. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://twitter.com/BnhaMovie3"">https://twitter.com/BnhaMovie3</a>  The story in is not revolutionary either for the game medium or for the series, but it is the dialogues and interactions between the different characters that shine the strongest here. During the journey, topics such as friendship, trust and insecurity are addressed, while there is almost always an accurate dose of humor embedded. The new character Rivet is also a far more interesting and complex character than the gullible hero Ratchet, with an exciting background story and a charming personality. The emotions reach out even more due to the brilliant voice acting (a bonus is that it is also possible to play with Swedish voices) and the characters' live minions."

Still messing with the ratios of each reborn, probably should run A.Idle at 3.

It's a funny format that plays like old school yugioh, but without some of the more unfair banned cards. The format also includes cards up to the set ""Shadow of Infinity"" giving it a bigger card pool. This deck is for people who want to say: ""screw all of that, I'm still going to sack you out with a bullshit OTK"".  Some important things to note is that this format uses some of the older texts of cards such as Exchange of the Spirit with the original text being: You can only activate this card by paying 1000 Life Points while there are 15 or more cards in your Graveyard. Both players swap the card(s) in their Graveyard with the card(s) in their Deck. Then, shuffle the card(s) in each new Deck and put it on the Deck Zone. Or DMOC who's original text reads: When this card is Normal Summoned or Special Summoned successfully, you can add 1 Spell Card from your Graveyard to your hand. A monster that is destroyed by this monster as a result of battle is removed from play instead of going to the Graveyard. When this card is destroyed or removed from the field, it is removed from play.  &nbsp;"

Ah the Phantom Knights, my favorite archetype of all time, and I'm glad you came here to check it out. This is one of the fastest combo decks at the rogue status. From spamming out XYZ monsters, to spitting out 7 negate boards, this deck is the complete package. And I'm happy you want to play them as well. Now, lets get into the main strategy, the Phantom Knights focus on banishing themselves for searches, sending more Phantom Knights to the graveyard, and they even work well with the never-dying Burning Abyss archetype. Hence the popular name PK Fire (Phantom Knights + Fire, and is also a reference to Ness' famous move). So, lets go over the main Phantom Knights. First up is The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots. This is one of the important ones, this card is essential for combos and helps get your spells and traps to set up your negates. Next is The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales. Arguably the best out of all the Phantom Knights, this one can special summon itself when another Phantom Knights is banished, which you'll find happens a lot. Next is The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak. Also one of the important ones, this is how you'll search your Silent Boots for combos. Next is The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves. This one Isn't used nearly as much as the others, but still comes up, It allows you to send cards like Phantom Knights' Wing to revive other Phantom Knights for extending combos. Last, and probably least, is The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves. We're only playing one for a reason, this card just doesn't come up that much. And that's not saying it never comes up, its just a lot rarer to pull of than the others. Trust me.  &nbsp;  The Extra Deck  &nbsp;  The extra deck is obviously very important to this strategy. And that's why were going over it! So let's go over the XYZ monsters. First off is The Phantom Knights of Break Sword. This Monster is really important, and what's also important, is that It's not a hard once per turn. So you can pull off multiple on the same turn, and you'll find out by playing the deck, is pretty good. Next up is Leviair The Sea Dragon, where do I begin, this card is just good. That's all that really needs to be said, aside from the fact you can bring back your banished Phantom Knights, and what's also cool, is that Leviair is conveniently rank 3. Next up is one of our tech cards, that of which is Zeus. Arguably one of the most powerful XYZ monsters currently in the game. You can stack this over an XYZ monster to bypass other monsters with destruction protection, such as annoying cards like Dragoon. Next is Raiders' Knight, this card allows you to OTK the opponent fairly easily, which is why were playing it. Next is Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon. This is what you're using Raiders' Knight to summon. This card is a beast, being able to gain ATK equal to every other monster on the field is good, and the fact it also negates the effects of every other monster on the field. Granted it negates yours as well, but that doesn't matter since you're just going to OTK with it anyways. Up next is Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon, and Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon. You use Break Sword to make Rebellion XYZ Dragon, more on that later. But for now we'll cover why were using this card. For one, Dark Requiem's negate effect Isn't once per turn. But the only reason were using Rebellion XYZ Dragon is just to go into Requiem, You'll almost never use Rebellion XYZ Dragon by itself. And that covers all the XYZ monsters, now we'll move onto the link monsters. First up we have one of the strongest links in the game, that being The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche (My favorite monster of all time). Oh boy, this card is really something. I could probably write a whole article dedicated to this card alone, but we'll cover this card later. Sheesh. Next up is Apollousa, Bow of The Goddess. This card is a big help with setting and establishing boards. Very very helpful. Next is Cherubini, Ebon Angel of The Burning Abyss. If you're not running this card, what's wrong with you...? It lets you pull of your main combos, and is great support when it comes to making Rusty. Lastly is Knightmare Phoenix and Knightmare Unicorn. These are just generic removal tools, nothing much to say about them. And that should cover the entire extra deck. Lets move on to the fun part, combos.  &nbsp;  Combos And Final Thoughts  &nbsp;  Now, here's where the fun begins. Here I'll go over the main combos.  Key: SS = Special Summon. NS = Normal Summon. Search = Add The Card From The Deck To Your Hand. GY = Graveyard. XS = XYZ Summon. LS = Link Summon.  NS Tour Guide &gt; SS Graff &gt; LS Cherubini &gt; Graff effect to SS Cir from deck &gt; Cherubini effect to send Cloak to the GY &gt; LS Rusty using Cir and Cherubini &gt; Cir effect to revive the Cherubini from the GY &gt; Rusty effect to send Scales to the GY and set a Fog Blade &gt; Banish Cloak to search Boots, SS Scales from the GY &gt; SS Boots &gt; XYZ Summon Leviair using Boots and Scales &gt; Detach Boots to SS Cloak from the banished zone &gt; Link into Apollousa using Leviair, Cherubini, and Cloak &gt; Banish Boots from the GY to search a Fog Blade and set it. So this basic combo ends on 5 negates. Obviously you shouldn't rely on this combo every game, but this is just to give you an idea of how this deck plays.  Now for a more advanced combo:  NS Scales &gt; SS Kagemucha Knight from your hand &gt; Use Scales effect to discard and send Cloak to the GY &gt; Link Scales And Kagemucha into Cherubini &gt; Use Cherubini to send Graff to the GY &gt; Use Graff effect to SS Cir from the deck &gt; Link Cir and Cherubini into Rusty &gt; Use Cir effect to revive Cherubini &gt; Use Rusty effect to send Ragged Gloves to the GY and set a Rank Up Magic &gt; Banish Gloves to send Wings to the GY, and SS Scales from the GY &gt; Banish Wings to SS Cloak from the GY &gt; XS Break Sword in Rusty's arrow, and use Rusty's effect to Destroy Break Sword &gt; Use Break Swords effect to special summon Scales and Cloak from the GY &gt; XS Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon &gt; On the opponent's turn use Rank Up Magic to XS Dark Requiem XYZ Dragon. And there's the end of the combo. There's a lot more combos you can pull off with this deck. Many I didn't list, because I like to leave some of the job to you guys. The deck I made and Submitted should serve as a template for this deck. Don't feel obligated to keep it this way, make changes to match how you'd like to play it. And that's all for this guide.

Cynet Codec is one of, if not the most important spell in the deck, allowing you to search a new monster off of link summoning a Code Talker. In order to take advantage of this link-climbing capability this spell represents, there's one Code Talker of each attribute to maximize the potential Codec has. While this deck list may not be perfect, It's a general representation of how the deck likes to operate. Now that the intro is over with, lets get into the basic  strategies one can pull off using this deck. First off, lets go over what you're searching off of Codec: Micro Coder, Mathmech Subtraction and Addition, Scrypton, Code Radiator, Parallel EXceed, and last but certainly not least, Code Generator. Now let's go over each application each monster has. Micro Coder can be searched off of summoning Accesscode Talker, when Micro Coder is used as material in the hand, this will allow you to add a Cynet s/t, adding some consistency to the Codec strategy. If It's used on the field as material, you're given the choice of two level four extenders still remaining in your deck. Primary choices for this search includes: Mathmech Addition and Subtraction, and Code Radiator. Next up to go over is Mathmech Addition and Subtraction. Both of these monsters will be searched off of summoning Power Code Talker, however they do not need to be searched to be usable, as these monsters can be special summoned for free at your disposal. Next monster to be gone over is Scrypton. Scrypton is one of the two water-attribute monsters that you'll be searching off of summoning Shootingcode Talker. Scrypton primarily doesn't want to be in your opening hand, however if it manages to land there, It's still able to be used, as there's two water-attribute monsters you can search with Codec. That of which being Code Radiator. While Code Radiator is generally weaker than the other hand material monsters, It's attack-reducing effect isn't why were playing it. The primary focus of this card is to be used as link material in the hand, much like Micro Coder and Code Generator. Next up is Parallel EXceed, which is one of the most powerful extenders in the cyberse toolbox. The fact this monster is searchable and is that powerful is just...powerful to say the least. Anyways you will be searching this monster off of summoning Excode Talker, one of the lesser-played Talkers, but is used for the fact you can search such powerful monsters from it. Now moving on to to last of our list of monsters, we have Code Generator. Code Generator has a  diverse amount of options you can use its effect for. Not including the hand material effect. But we'll get to the plays it enables in our next section of this guide.  &nbsp;  Starter Cards And Combo Extensions:  &nbsp;  Your starter cards are how you're going to get your combos going. If those somehow get put to a halt, you have extenders hopefully in your hand so your turn doesn't end on a pitiful board. Your main starters are as followed: Clock Wyvern, Lady Debug, Dotscaper (If you open it). And with this small array of monsters, lets go over what you can pull off with these. Starting off with the one and only Clock Wyvern. Clock Wyvern is one of the few monsters that's immune to being hit by an Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring. So when you summon it, you're going to want to make Splash Mage. And then use Splash Mages effect to revive the fallen Clock Wyvern. From there, you have an array of Code Talkers you can make (Assuming you have Codec out). The most common play to make here is going into Transcode Talker and reviving the Splash Mage you used as material (And searching a Code Generator if you happen to have Cynet Codec out on your field). And then finally making an Accesscode Talker using the Splash Mage and Transcode Talker you currently posses on your field. This gives you 2 link monsters for dealing with the opponents board, or just for the sake of having a beatstick (To my surprise it comes up a lot...but that Isn't your main focus with this card). Now onto our next starter, Lady Debug. This card has been used in multiple other strategies, one of the biggest being Salamangreat. But while this card may have high representation in cyberse-typed deck, lets go over how good this card is in a deck such as the one were going over. When you normal summon this card, it grants you the ability to add a level 4 or lower cyberse-type monster to your hand. This effect can be used to your advantage in multiple situations. This card also ties in with Balancer Lord, another one of our other uh...Support monsters...? I don't know how to describe it, but it works well with quite a few monsters included in this deck. The biggest being Lady Debug, because you can simply summon Balancer Lord, then normal summon Lady Debug, get your search, and now you have an extra piece of link material. Granted it Isn't much, but It's something. Cards you'd want to search off Lady Debug are usually monsters you can immediately special summon from your hand. Such as backup secretary or the two Mathmechs. You can also add a monster such as Dotscaper, for when you have a card like Code Talker Inverted, which would allow you to summon the monster you added and continue your combo. Now we'll go over how you can extender your combos. One way being the pitch you get off of Code Generator. The main card you'd send with this effect would be Dotscaper, which you could immediately special summon from the graveyard. Yes, yes I know, yell at me all you want for playing Upstart Goblin in 2021. But I swear, it works well with this deck! If you open with Cynet Codec and you use the effect of Micro Coder, you have two options here, you can either search Optimization for an extra normal summon. Or you can add Cynet Mining to search a needed extender for your combo. Hoping you have a card you can discard, if your lucky something like Dotscaper, but thats pretty unlikely, but something ive been able to pull of with Cynet Mining is discarding a cyberse monster, then searching a starter, then special summoning the monster you discarded and using its effect, assuming you can.  &nbsp;  Closing Thoughts.  &nbsp;  Now that we've gone over the essential info, It's time you've experimented with this deck yourself. There's many combinations you can use, many of which I didn't cover in this guide, because that's your job. Yes, you the person reading this. I hope you enjoyed this article as much as I had writing it, and I'll see you in the next one!"

Get Light pulsar on the field and nuke it with phantom of Chaos coping sky scourges effect. You can use plaguespreader to manipulate the card you will draw after you nuke the field (BLS anyone). Light pulsar is also great for manipulating the grave by being able to summons himself from it by discarding a light and dark from your hand. The extra deck monsters that you use are M7 and Chaos Ruler. It's rare for me to use any of the others. When all else fails nuke the field and hope for the best.

Dragon's Bind and Field Barrier are unsearchable 3-ofs, so you need to use 3 Pot of Prosperity to help you find them.  The side deck is filled with cards that be used by other build options for this deck.  One weakness of the deck is that it has no follow-up play even in the (somewhat unlikely) event it goes off. Since Black Garden can be reliably searched by a level 5 synchro, at the cost of only a tiny amount of consistency, 1x Terraforming, 2x Black Garden, and 1x Cynet mining can be removed for 1x Malefic Truth Dragon, 1x Foolish Burial and 1x Dragon Shrine to put it in the GY, and 1 more copy of Allure of Darkness in case it ends up in your hand.  Malefic Truth Dragon provides some recovery if they manage to get rid of Malefic Rainbow Dragon.  Another weakness is how bad the deck is going second.  By again removing 1x Terraforming, 2x Black Garden, 1x Cynet Mining, and 1x Upstart Goblin, and adding 1x Neos, 3x Neos Fusion, and an additional Rainbow Dragon, (or keep upstart) you can have Rainbow Neos' powerful board wipes for going second.  Alternatively, you could remove those same 5 cards for hand traps such as Ash Blossom and InfImp.  The last card in the side deck is Imperial Custom, which protects continuous traps.  If you play this card, it is possible to add it as 5th card to enhance the lockdown."
