You will send albion the branded dragon so that you will be able to set your branded in red at the end phase and have it live on your opponents turn. When you use branded fusion going first you're always going to want to send despian tragedy to search the ad libitum of despia because using him as material from your hand when making the chimera allows you to Immediately special summon the mirrorjade back to your side of the field with its banish effect live again.  The frighfur package helps you get materials in your hand for guardian chimera as well as possibly being bait for an ash blossom.  The light hex sealed fusion allows access to dragoon and can also be used as a third copy of Fallen of albaz in a pinch.  The hand traps that hurt the deck the most are played as crossout designator targets at 2x.  The side deck mostly consists of blowout cards for going second with the inclusion of a small zombie world package. You can send Necroworld banshee off of branded fusion to access your zombie world and you can then use super polymerization to make dragonecro nethersoul dragon using your opponents monsters as material.

And the name for this deck is pretty obvious, especially if you watched Dateline back in the early 2000s. Chris Hansen was the GOAT!  &nbsp;  Anyway, this deck is good going first or second, put personally, I prefer going first to set up as many disruptions as I can.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Summon the Omni-Negate, Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode. Figure out the best strategy to play the deck. Hardcore vibes, let's","<p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""5"">Welcome to the first set of my structure deck series. The series was inspired by my evaluation of certain archetypes I had played for quite some time in order to at least understand the basic mechanism in a specific period of time.This is, of course, not an official structure deck, I'm just unable to think of a better name.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""6"">Let's just head right into the deck. The first set, ""Structure Deck: Assault <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""77"" data-endindex=""85"" data-paragraphid=""6"">Emergency</span>"" is an Assault Mode-based deck. Some people probably say that Assault Mode is inherently bad, and I myself admit that it lacks what it takes to be a top deck, at least for now (although Konami seems to have abandoned this archetype, not giving any helpful support since 2019). The best buff they ever gave so far was probably making Emergency Teleport turn to Unlimited (3) status.</p>  <h3 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""7"">GENERAL STRATEGY</h3> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""8"">So, you see, there's actually no particular innate strategy available in the archetype itself, except by continuously relying on the combo of Psi-Reflector to Special Summon our Boss Monsters. The best we could do (without brainstorming with deckbuilding and further advancement and also wasting even more time) is to create our own strategy and spend most of the time relying on decisions and field analysis. It's pretty important for Assault Mode users, as the only factor I could find to make Assault Mode stand a chance is an experienced and wise duelist.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""9"">If you do not like to read card effects (at least for the cards you are not familiar with), you better start playing other archetypes instead of this one. It's going to be rough for you otherwise. Decision-making is very crucial. In this deck, you can say that the Extra Deck is our main arsenal, and the Main Deck is a tool to access it. I've been watching countless videos and brainstorming for quite a while (credit to DarkArmedDuelist's video), and I think I have found a decent arrangement for the deck. So let's just head to the explanation section about why I chose each of 'em.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""10"">Oh wait, one more thing. This is also important, yet a minor warning. First, this deck description section of mine might take a decent amount of time to read and even somewhat will possibly make you disappointed in the end (both because of the deck or my explanation, which may be proved to be a waste of time). Second, for dueling tips while using this deck of mine, please stop being a subjective duelist who wants to win climaxly if you do, because it's not going to work with this deck. You better finish your opponent as fast as possible and quietly, while you still have a chance. My gameplay so far has taught me that Assault Mode doesn't really stand a chance against most of the meta or top tier rogue decks in general, because of the fact that you can normally only summon 1 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""780"" data-endindex=""791"" data-paragraphid=""10"">Boss Monster</span> per turn via Psi-Reflector. But hey, my friend said that this deck of mine would make it to a mid-tier rogue deck. It's quite fun to play, too. Anyway, to the explanation section!</p>  <h3 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""11"">DECK MEMBERS</h3> <h5 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""12"">MAIN DECK</h5> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""13"">A. Monsters</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""14""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""30"" data-paragraphid=""14"">1) Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""15"">First off, our Boss Monster. If you've been playing the game for quite a while or intend on using the AM deck, I'm pretty sure you have at least heard of this card. <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""165"" data-endindex=""169"" data-paragraphid=""15"">Right</span>, SDAM is one of the better Assault Mode monsters. I mean, look. It's an Omni-Negate<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""254"" data-endindex=""258"" data-paragraphid=""15"">, you</span> can also get a free SD when this card is destroyed. <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""312"" data-endindex=""315"" data-paragraphid=""15"">SDAM</span> is probably the best AM monster (at least in pure Assault-Engine-based decks) due to its powerful effect and ease of summoning. You just need to bring up Stardust Dragon, which is already one of the easiest AM materials to summon and Assault Mode Activate it. This powered-up version of SD is indeed powerful, but not without any weaknesses. One, the main weakness will be the fact that the AM <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""711"" data-endindex=""716"" data-paragraphid=""15"">Engine</span> is fragile and can easily be destroyed by a single disruptive force. Two, this card is very vulnerable during its effect activation. Although you can use this card to negate, your opponent can also continue the chain and destroy this card easily. Three, cards like Called By The Grave are simply the natural enemy of SD and its AM counterpart. They not only prevented this card from returning after activating its effect, you also simply lost that free SD I mentioned. Five<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""1191"" data-endindex=""1196"" data-paragraphid=""15"">, this</span> card is <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""1206"" data-endindex=""1212"" data-paragraphid=""15"">USELESS</span> if you draw it from your deck. It's as if you literally skip 1 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""1277"" data-endindex=""1286"" data-paragraphid=""15"">Draw Phase</span> if you draw this card. The only way to fix this is to simply discard it for effect activation or use it via Assault Mode Zero.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""16"">Lastly, SDAM is very easy to bait. You need to use the effect very wisely. The card is a gun with only 1 bullet. Choose the cards to negate wisely.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""17"">2) Psi-Reflector</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Here comes our star. You definitely can't run an AM deck without this little <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""74"" data-endindex=""78"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Tuner</span> fellow. This card carries the whole Assault <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""122"" data-endindex=""127"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Engine</span> and the AM Engine itself revolves around this card. When this card is summoned, you can add 1 AM Activate or any monster that lists it in their card texts. Then, you can reveal AM Activate from your hand to trigger this card's ultimate effect. You can Special Summon 1 monster that has ""AM Activate"" in its card text<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""448"" data-endindex=""448"" data-paragraphid=""18"">,</span> and increase its level up to 4. With this effect, you can definitely access most of the level 6 to 9 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""547"" data-endindex=""562"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Synchro Monsters</span>. This card is also easily searchable via other deck members. Too bad, this card can only activate its effect once per turn, leading the deck to only be able to summon 1 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""735"" data-endindex=""746"" data-paragraphid=""18"">Boss Monster</span> consistently per turn if it was not negated (this is also very negatable). Make sure you use your resources efficiently to create a straight path (remove all possible threats on the field) for this card to shine.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""19""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""18"" data-paragraphid=""19"">3) Assault Sentinel</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""20"">The 2nd best assault monster after the Psi-Reflector. This card can be used to search for Psi-Reflectors and even prepare a target for its effect (since this card will go straight to the GY). Another effect of this card can change a monster's <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""243"" data-endindex=""251"" data-paragraphid=""20"">attribute</span> via an Extra Deck monster's attribute. This effect is a great addition to Psi-Reflector, allowing you to access even more Synchro Monsters with more <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""402"" data-endindex=""412"" data-paragraphid=""20"">restricting</span> material lists. The backlash<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""442"" data-endindex=""442"" data-paragraphid=""20"">,</span> is that you can't <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""462"" data-endindex=""475"" data-paragraphid=""20"">Special Summon</span> any monster this turn except Synchro Monsters (a few other cards also have a similar restriction). Not really a problem for this deck.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""21""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""15"" data-paragraphid=""21"">4) Assault Beast</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""22"">A searcher for AM Activate. You only need one in your deck. Since you can easily search for this card via Psi-Reflector, and even Assault Sentinel gives more beneficial effects than this card. Still pretty useful, though, in certain situations.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""23""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""40"" data-paragraphid=""23"">5) Ascator, Dawnwalker &amp; Fire Ant Ascator</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""24"">For time-sake, I will make things shorter. Maybe you should read the card effects to understand what I will say. Both cards are a pair. <span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""159"" data-endindex=""206"" data-paragraphid=""24"">Have a similar restriction as Assault Sentinel. </span>These pairs are the alternatives to the Psi-Reflector. With only the Psi Reflector, you can only summon 2 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""307"" data-endindex=""319"" data-paragraphid=""24"">Boss Monsters</span> at the very best. With this pair, you get the 3rd. I recommend either discarding useless SDAM or AM <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""417"" data-endindex=""420"" data-paragraphid=""24"">Zero</span>, or any less useful card for your situation.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""25""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""74"" data-paragraphid=""25"">6) PSY-Framegear Gamma (w/PSY-Frame Driver) &amp; Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""26"">Our main <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""9"" data-endindex=""16"" data-paragraphid=""26"">handtrap</span> force on the deck. The PSY-Frame Driver is recycleable, so you only need 1. Just make sure you won't make it banished unless you're forced to, since it's no longer recycleable in that situation. And yeah<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""215"" data-endindex=""216"" data-paragraphid=""26"">..</span> some classic Ash Blossom. I believe I don't need any further exposition. The PSY-Frame pair can even be an alternative to summoning another <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""355"" data-endindex=""366"" data-paragraphid=""26"">Boss Monster</span>, if you manage to activate it in your own turn, or chain it with the Synchron Formula available in your <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""468"" data-endindex=""476"" data-paragraphid=""26"">Side Deck</span> (<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""479"" data-endindex=""479"" data-paragraphid=""26"">A</span> pretty rare case).</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""27""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""59"" data-paragraphid=""27"">7) Nibiru, The Primal Being &amp; Gameciel, The Sea Turtle Kaiju</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""28"">Uh huh. Other classic cards<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""27"" data-endindex=""28"" data-paragraphid=""28"">. </span>These two cards are useful for getting rid of some monsters your opponent controls by tributing them. Use them wisely, and make sure you have something in your sleeve to destroy them later, since you definitely don't want your cards to be used against you. Pay special attention to Nibiru, since its stats are determined by the monsters it <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""356"" data-endindex=""363"" data-paragraphid=""28"">tributed</span>.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""29"">B.

Next, our spells. Start with AM Zero. It's a card you don't want to run more than 1 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""121"" data-endindex=""125"" data-paragraphid=""31"">copy </span>in your deck. You only need one in this deck, really. You can use this card to get rid of those annoying SDAMs in your hand, so that they can finally get some use. You can also get this card in your GY banished, so you can set AM Activate and immediately activate it this turn. This card is a perfect target for Ascator pairs or any cards that require discarding. The starthand combo is to discard this card by the Ascator effect and then Synchro Summon SD, and use this effect to immediately summon our SDAM on your very first turn.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""32""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""20"" data-paragraphid=""32"">2) Emergency Teleport</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""33"">A very useful <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""14"" data-endindex=""21"" data-paragraphid=""33"">searcher</span> card<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""27"" data-endindex=""28"" data-paragraphid=""33"">. </span>Use this card to search for either Psi-Reflector or Psy-Framegear (most of the time, the first one), and Bam. You get yourself into the engine's core that easily. The effect is simple, but believe me. You need to run 3 copies of this card<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""259"" data-endindex=""259"" data-paragraphid=""33"">,</span> to ensure the highest consistency of the Psi-Reflector combo.

The combo that I can think of is using this card after the effect of Psy-Framegear is resolved, to Special Summon Formula Synchron<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""265"" data-endindex=""265"" data-paragraphid=""46"">,</span> and give some elements of surprise. I believe you guys have better creativity than mine. Feel free to replace this card with any better card you know.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""47""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""42"" data-paragraphid=""47"">3) Solemn Judgement &amp; Infinite Impermanence</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""48""><span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""7"" data-paragraphid=""48"">Handtrap</span> disruptive force and Omni-Negate. Although <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""52"" data-endindex=""67"" data-paragraphid=""48"">Solemn Judgement</span> comes with a painful cost, it's still worth it as long as you use it wisely. Pay attention to the placement of Infinite Impermanence. You can also use it for the 2nd bullet after SDAM activation, if it's the only monster you control.</p>  <h5 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""49"">EXTRA DECK</h5> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""50""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""17"" data-paragraphid=""50"">1) Stardust Dragon</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""51"">Vanilla Stardust Dragon. You need this to summon SDAM. <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""55"" data-endindex=""57"" data-paragraphid=""51"">Can</span> be Synchro Summoned by using either Psi-Reflector, Ascator, or Psy-Framegear. I only put 1 in the Extra Deck, and the other one is available in the Side Deck, in case you want to go for a consistent 2nd SDAM. Why? <span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""273"" data-endindex=""399"" data-paragraphid=""51"">Because you can Special Summon this one SD from your GY using Monster Reborn or Back To The Front and get a 2nd SDAM that way. </span>But eh, most of the time, you simply do not use or discard that 2nd SDAM. But, feel free to re-organize the <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""508"" data-endindex=""518"" data-paragraphid=""51"">Extra Deck,</span> and probably tell me some better alternatives<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""565"" data-endindex=""567"" data-paragraphid=""51"">.. </span>Make yourself comfortable.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""52""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""20"" data-paragraphid=""52"">2) Satellite Warrrior</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""53"">A level 10 <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""11"" data-endindex=""25"" data-paragraphid=""53"">Synchro Monster</span>. This card is pretty decent, potentially clears the board, and is a beatstick. You only need the extra <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""129"" data-endindex=""133"" data-paragraphid=""53"">Tuner</span> and synchro monster at a suitable level.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""54""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""29"" data-paragraphid=""54"">3) Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""55"">Another decent card, although a bit harder to summon.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""56""><span class=""blue-underline"" data-startindex=""0"" data-endindex=""28"" data-paragraphid=""56"">4) Level 6-9 Synchro Monsters</span></p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""57"">You can replace any of these monsters with any better card you can think of. Just keep in mind that you should avoid <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""117"" data-endindex=""125"" data-paragraphid=""57"">choosing </span>Synchro Monster with overly restrictive material requirements. However, Assault Sentinel really has you extending your range of choices. The Extra Deck is your powerful arsenal, so choose the right monster for the right condition. I will give a short description of each of my Extra Deck monsters, just in case you want to know why I picked them.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""58"">Vermillion D. M.: <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""18"" data-endindex=""18"" data-paragraphid=""58"">A</span> decent card destroyer.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""59"">Ravenous Crocodragon: Draw power, as well as a strong beatstick. is a decent card destroyer.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""60"">Beelze: I use it to play <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""26"" data-endindex=""34"" data-paragraphid=""60"">defensive</span>. It is this deck's strongest defense wall (although I think there's a better alternative, I hope you don't mind telling me a card or two). I also usually play this card with Red Dragon AM in the <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""224"" data-endindex=""232"" data-paragraphid=""60"">Side Deck</span>, since Beelze isn't affected by its double-edged effect.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""61"">Kitedrake: A good board clearer<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""31"" data-endindex=""32"" data-paragraphid=""61"">. </span>You will need Assault Sentinel to summon this card. Even after clearing the board, you still get this beatstick as a great bonus.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""62"">Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon: Didn't really use it<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""34"" data-endindex=""36"" data-paragraphid=""62"">.. </span>Although this card somewhat will make it easier for you to Synchro Summon higher level Synchros.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""63"">Scarlight Red Dragon: I think this version of Red Dragon is better since most of the cards are <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""93"" data-endindex=""108"" data-paragraphid=""63"">Special Summoned</span> in the current meta. Also serves as a material for its AM counterpart.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""64"">Draco Berserker: Its banish effect is really good, and it annoys my opponent a lot most <span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""88"" data-endindex=""90"" data-paragraphid=""64"">of </span>time.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""65"">Framelord Omega: A recycleable Lightforce Sword.

I hope.</p>  <h5 class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""70"">SIDE DECK</h5> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""71"">The side deck is filled with my alternative strategy<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""50"" data-endindex=""50"" data-paragraphid=""71"">,</span> and any cards I want to be there. Again, you can search for a better replacement. Tell me your opinions in the comment section.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""72"">In the end, Assault Mode is indeed not a really good archetype. I don't recommend it for you to use it at all in competitive play. However, this deck is not without the slightest benefit. As for me, I think this is a really challenging deck to use. This deck requires more understanding and knowledge of the game than most decks. It really gives that vibe of a hardcore gamer's deck. It's still pretty fun to use, though.</p> <p class=""root-block-node"" data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""73"">I do hope that you guys that have more knowledge than me can help me improve this deck further. Feel free to give all of your honest opinions in the chat. That's all from me. Thanks for reading till the end. This article sure took some time to create<span class=""red-underline"" data-startindex=""249"" data-endindex=""251"" data-paragraphid=""73"">.. </span>And I really appreciate any attention. Thank you!</p>"

Magistus, DPE","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with another Shaddolls list but this time, one that is modified to fit the upcoming Fusion Festival in Master Duel and are also updated to utilize the new splashable (NOT GENERIC) boss monster, <strong><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong>.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>Well first of all, it's an easy choice. It makes sense, it has a strong match up against combo decks in general because of its boss monsters, and it can be played either aggressively with going second cards or defensively with trap cards. It's a versatile deck that can very much function well without relying on hand traps for coverage, and can abuse one of the most powerful board breaking tools in Yu-Gi-Oh that is almost exclusively used by Fusion strategies, <strong><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong>. Anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The Dolls</strong> - <span>Their ratios might be a bit stranger than usual but I can somehow explain why. I had to cut space with <a data-name=""Reeshaddoll Wendi"">Wendi</a> and <a data-name=""Shaddoll Squamata"">Squamata</a> to make room for 2 copies of <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>. This puts the deck in a position where it has just enough main starter materials as to not easily run out of them and still be able to go through the regular Shaddoll combo lines and still be able to fulfill the Rule of 5 (which is basically just having access to 5 Normal Summon starters in the deck), so what I've decided to play only 2 copies of both starter Shaddolls that of which I've already mentioned and only one of each utility Shaddoll monsters. And their main uses are:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Shaddoll Beast</a></strong> - <span>For draw power.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon</a></strong> - <span>For Spell/Trap removal</span>.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Nehshaddoll Genius"">Nehshaddoll Genius</a></strong> - <span>For shutting down an opponent's monster for the duration of the turn. It having a different Attribute is also occasionally relevant.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Shaddoll Hound</a></strong> - <span>For recovery</span>.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Shaddoll Hedgehog</a></strong> - <span>For searching</span>.</span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Qadshaddoll Keios"">Qadshaddoll Keios</a></strong> - <span>Only really relevant because of its different Attribute, being a LIGHT monster, as well as being a ""Shaddoll"" monster itself. Its Flip effect do come up from though very rarely, but it's better to have than not.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Shaddoll Falco</a></strong> - <span>For your grind game loops with Ariel and Hound.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• Magistus, the engine of choice</strong> - <span>The reasoning behind this is actually simpler, and that's also why I personally think this is one of if not the best version of Shaddolls that you can play in Master Duel's Fusion Festival, contending Invoked, and I'll be discussing more of it in-depth individually.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre</strong></a> - <span>The superior Normal Summon for a generic Fusion engine, if you just want to play Pure Shaddolls. She practically does the same thing as <a data-name=""Aleister the Invoker"">Aleister the Invoker</a>, except she's already a LIGHT monster, triggers off of being Special Summoned as well, and despite both of them being able to search for a Fusion Spell, their applications can be different depending on the situation. Aleister offers offensive pressure by being a ATK/DEF modifying hand trap, she offers recovery. Aleister offers more aggression to the table with additional Fusion Monsters in the form of the Invoked, she offers versatility for Link Climbing and Xyz/Synchro plays due to the nature of her archetype if you want to employ more of them. It really just comes down to your preference AND focus.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Magistus Vritra&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Magistus Vritra</strong></a> - <span>Commonly used to Link Climb into either a <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> for either Dragoon or DPE, or a Selene play for <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, but this time, having access to a LIGHT monster all the time in a format where you can't Link Climb is more than welcome and enough.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Magistus Invocation&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Magistus Invocation</strong></a> - <span>The archetypal Fusion Spell, similar to <a data-name=""Invocation"">Invocation</a> due to them being both semi-generic Fusion spells but different in application, but at least it allows you to use materials from your hand when you Fusion Summon with it, which is the most frustrating part about the Invocation.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the deck, cry about it. No seriously, this Fusion Spell is one of the three most revolutionary Fusion Spells in the game, alongside Super Polymerization and Invocation (I'm choosing this one because it's archetypal and <a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a> is not, it's not that serious really.)</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Battle Phase shenanigans. It also allows you to play around targeting interruption/removal due to it being a Quick-Play Spell. It also allows you to do the first half of your usual Shaddolls combo while playing around <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>. Good enough as a searchable one of but more copies is welcome if felt needed.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a></strong> - <span>I'm playing 2 because I think it's the standard. You could probably get away with 1, but additional copies for safeguard is always good for anything if you can play with it well enough, especially in slower variants of the deck.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shaddoll Core"">Shaddoll Core</a></strong> - <span>One of the most underrated card in the whole Shaddoll card pool. This card is one of the keys as to why this deck can GRIND. Its recovery effect when sent to the GY by a card effect is NOT ONCE PER TURN, meaning if you can somehow loop it, you can keep recurring resources back to your hand.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a></strong> - <span>This card is awfully disrespected by a lot of people due to it having the reputation of being ""only a Winda enabler"", but no. People seem to forget its more powerful effect of non-targeting, non-destruction removal that happens on resolution, provided that your opponent has a monster that shares an Attribute with the Shaddoll Fusion Monster you Fusion Summoned with this card. You do not have to summon only Winda with this. If your opponent has a problematic monster, feel free to summon a Shaddoll Fusion Monster with a matching Attribute instead. One copy is standard but I've seen some people play 2 and that's actually pretty reasonable. Do it if you have access to more, but one is enough.</span></span>  <span><strong>Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The Fusion Dolls</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a></strong> - <span>Notorious for two things: 1. Enabling resource loop ever since it got introduced into the game, which results in a fantastic grind game. 2. Its non-targeting destruction effect that happens at the start of the Damage Step. There's a reason why it got Limited and even Banned for quite a long time. 2 is enough for some, but if you can play 3, there's no reason not to.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a></strong> - <span>The bane of every tryhard combo decks. One of the most famous floodgate monster in the game, with a very powerful effect of limiting both players to only 1 Special Summons for each per turn. It also has a destruction protection against card effects, that most people seem to forget when attempting to get rid of her. 2 is enough but you could always dare to play 3.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a></strong> - <span>The newest addition to the Shaddoll Fusion Monster line up, the key to both your grind game and also the source of your targeting interruption. Being indestructible by battle, she's also not a bad defensive monster. Also, people seem to forget that her negation effect is PERMANENT. Always do keep that in mind. Much like Winda, 2 of her is enough.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a></strong> - <span>Our only archetypal reactive negation effect in the deck, she used to be the go-to defensive Shaddoll monster, until Apkallone at least, due to her massive 3000 DEF body. We could play her since we have Extra Deck space, and also a good reason to play Mathematician.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis</strong></a> - <span>The hard counter to Nekroz back in the day, and nowadays, Drytrons. She doesn't have anything proactive, instead she acts also much like Winda, except she's preventing both players from Special Summoning monsters from the hand or GY with Spell/Trap effects, that includes Ritual Summoning. She's also not bad at 2700 ATK. Just a one of, also the reason why we could play 2 Ariels.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>The others are pretty much all generic Super Polymerization targets that you feel like using. I prefer the usual line up of <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> for DARK heavy decks or mirror matches, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> is actually arguably best one for this format in particular, and <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a> for the weird Attribute presence. <a data-name=""Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit"">Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit</a> is also technically a Super Polymerization target, and is a walking Fiendish Chain in itself. <a data-name=""Invoked Augoeides"">Invoked Augoeides</a>, in case we run into Invoked match ups, and the man of the hour himself, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">DPE</a>.</span>  <strong><span>Final Thoughts:</span></strong>  <span>Well, it's Shaddolls, and I absolutely fucking love them if it wasn't obvious enough. I can't wait to participate in the Normal Summon Aleister Festival, so much so that I might actually try and clear the rewards up to the title. I've already featured this deck and its variants in my former lists, multiple times, so I don't think I have much else to say about it as of now. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Obviously decks with strong boss monsters that are not in the extra deck are strong in this type of format.  Ultimate Conductor Tyranno with Double Evolution pill is perfect. Sending Overtex with branded fusion will allow you a quick double evolution pill. Or you can always send dark magician and then go into a Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon.

Also the foolish burial goods is in the deck to dump the defense of changban trap card but you could replace the burials with small worlds.  Crossout designator and called by are important pieces of the deck considering it goes second but its great at baiting hand traps and negates.  Lastly you can put whatever you want in the extra deck for the xyz monsters but the link monster is the most important one you absolutely should run everything else is bonus.

The game plan for this deck is to get out the Buster Blader fusion and Buster Dragon out as fast as possible, in order to lock down the field, OR to use the Rokkets like normal and make whatever cards you want, like Borreload Savage, Chaos Ruler, Abyss, etc. </span>  <span><span>This also works for the TCG, just replace Maxx C for something else (like Veiler, Ogre, Droll, etc). If you're running this outside of Master Duel, I'd recommend swapping out Apollousa for Borrelend Dragon. You can also swap out Borrelsword for Borreload or whatever other Link-4 you want, I just like Borrelsword for OTK purposes because Buster Blader lockdown + Borrelsword is basically a garunteed OTK.</span></span>"

I just don't enjoy decks that does not make me want to think. It's one of those decks that I can play on a bad day and still win because it just plays itself, much like the other three. Play it if you want, I could not care any less. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can (I mean in this case, I'd rather not but I still do enjoy interacting with you guys so, yeah. Questions about anything that isn't related to this list is also very much welcome.).</span>"

It is built around the card Banisher of the Light which allows you to cultivate a game state where your graveyard empty and your exile zone is full. This will unlock a number of powerful cards which otherwise don't see play including Chaos Greed and Chaos End. When things are going well, this deck will have the best card draw in the format. We are also running Bazoo and Chaosrider to keep the bin clear and maintain board presence until you are ready to swing in for game with Gren Maju.

I am playing them with the Symphonic Warrior engine, Genex Undine and a focus on revivability.  The Symphonic Warriors grant you an additional normal summon and a free level 5 machine type monster which you can use with Sulfefnir to go into Infinity. The ""Garnet"" itself ain't that much of a brick if you draw it, since tribute summoning him gets you the additional normal summon aswell. Try to get him into the grave instead of the extra deck afterwards if you can because you can revive him with the smaller Symphonic Warrior and get the effect again.  I also play Genex Undine since the mill from the deck is a cost and cannot be negated. Genex Controller can become a hard brick sometimes.  I am only playing 1 Halqi even though he is unlimited in TCG because I basically have 5 revives for him from which I can search 3. Because of Halqi I also play T.G. Wonder Magician who's an MST on summon and can also synchro summon on opponent's turn.  I have played Sulfefnir at 3 for the longest time and have just been experimenting with 2 for a few weeks. So far I do not think I have lost any consistency but instead have less dead cards in grave/hand.  Playing 6 handtraps can be bricky at times but you kind of have to play at least a few in the current state of the game.  The Ice-Bound God is a better Lost Wind in this deck.  Unchained Abomination just works perfectly.  Dragite or Dawn Dragster should always be on your field. Even better if you have an Infinity on their side.  &nbsp;  If you want to start playing this deck I cannot recommend enough to only us the non-tuners field effect if you really have to since it locks you into only Synchro machine type monsters.  &nbsp;  All in all I can really recommend this deck to anyone playing on locals-level. It is fairly consistent, has a great recovery and it's not a helmet deck, so you gotta use your brain."

This deck is intended for the 2005 DS game, Nightmare Troubadour. It's mostly for me to plan out what cards I want before I get them, so be advised that this is largely untested. The hope is that RML has enough spell fodder to get plusses. Thunder dragon is there to thin out the deck, although it might be prudent to replace him with Foolish Burial to get the Exodia pieces out of the way (you can get them back to the hand using Dark Factory and Monster Reincarnation). On the other hand, he's a great target for Card Destruction, so maybe not? Toon Alligator is there so that you can use all three Contents instead of awkwardly having one left over but he might end up being a brick in the hand. The rest should be pretty self-explanatory."

This is the most efficient Malefic deck Ive played, able to generally end up with up to three negates and a buff 4000/4000 or two out on your field turn one. But it still needs some fine tuning.  &nbsp;  Tip:  Gizmek Naganaki can tribute itself to summon Paradox gear from the deck, Paradox gear can then tribute itself to summon paralell gear and add Malefic stardust dragon to your hand, then, use both those Malefics for Baronne De Fleur for a negate, or Dragocytos for another buff attacker. Or add Raradigm dragon/Malefic cyber end dragon to go into Geomathmech final sigma."

On the play, the deck aims to set up a board with varied forms of interaction and sticky monsters to use to beat your opponent down on the crack back. On the draw, it can pivot with different forms of removal to push through boards and either swing over your opponents' monsters or easily access Zeus to wipe the board and combo in MP2. D/D/D is a high ceiling combo deck that can pivot between an aggressive playstyle and a control gameplan depending on what the situation calls for.  Overall a really fun deck that, with enough practice, any player can master and do well with. Any questions, comments or concerns you can msg me on discord @ drop_the_mike04#3517 :)."

Win Conditions: <ul>  	<li>Tsukumo Slash - Lower your lifepoints in a controlled fashion with Shining Angel / Wattdragonfly and then bring out an insane Tsukumo Slash boosted Wattaildragon. Action Magic - Full Turn or Kaijus will help finish the job.</li>  	<li>Inferno Tempest - Banish all monsters from the decks + 20 additional cards thanks to Necroface and Nyannyan. Thunder Dragonhawk is included here to chain block this and potentially shuffle Necroface(s) that you drew.</li>  	<li>Mystic Mine - Wattchimera can seal the game vs an opponent that can't link away enough monsters.</li> </ul> The extra deck is really only used to link into monsters with &lt;300 attack. Baba Barber is especially useful to link away a Kaiju + Necroface.  The side deck is something I'm still experimenting with. The goal here is to go first and get Wattdragonfly, Universal Adapter, and Thunder Dragon's Hundred Thunders out. Survive. Then OTK with 3-4 Wattgiraffe/Wattcobras with boosted attack values."

Made before the Cyberdark","Made before the Cyberdark Structure Deck was released in Master Duel.  Some explanaitions for some card choices: <ul>  	<li>Gizmek Yata: Can be specialed over Core, gives you an additional normal summon and is a material for Nova. Searchable via Repair Plant.</li>  	<li>Power Bond: Makes OTKs easier and quicker. Stronger with the Cyberdark support.</li>  	<li>Maxx ""C"": Strongest card in the game, I hate it, why is it legal in Master Duel.</li>  	<li>Denko Sekka: I played against too many Floodgate/Eldlich Decks. Completely shuts them down and allows you to dou your combo undisturbed by backrow cards.</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave: Saves you from handtraps and Eldlich.</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplet: Insane boardbreaker/OTK-enabler, activates Herz</li>  	<li>Imperm: Great handtrap and useful even if going first.</li>  	<li>Cyber Eternity Dragon: Occasionaly useful. A great wall.</li>  	<li>Invoked Mechaba: A target for Nova.</li>  	<li>Artifact Durendal: A good Rank 5 XYZ. Mostly used if you go first.</li>  	<li>Constellar Pleiades: A great Rank 5 XYZ. Useful going first or second.</li>  	<li>AA-ZEUS: Insane Card, can be recycled with Repair Plant</li> </ul> Some general tactics:  <strong>Going first:</strong>  On a good day you make Infinity and pass. On a great day you have at least one hand trap in reserve. On an even greater day you can also make Pleiades/Durendal.  <strong>Going second:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Nova is good for extending by reviving one Cyber Dragon and can occasionally also go for game. It also deters Nibiru.</li>  	<li>Infinity protects your plays from enemy interruption and can clean the board a bit.</li>  	<li>Rampage Dragon is your main OTK enabler. It can attack up to 3 times via it's effect, it removes enemy backrow and it can be buffed by Sieger.</li>  	<li>Fortress/Megafleet are used to clean up the opponents board.</li>  	<li>Sieger is used to power up Rampage Dragon. You can also increase your Nova, run over a defense position monster with Sieger and then hit the opponent for 4200.</li> </ul> Here is a link to the first Decklist: https://ygoprodeck.com/cyber-dragons-19/"

Either inflict 8000 damage with Watts or break the board enough to get a Mystic Mine out. This deck can easily OTK without removing Mystic Mine from the field, and Mystic Mine can allow you to use the high-risk Left Arm Offering.  3 card OTKs: <ul>  	<li>Interrupted Kaiju Slumber + Honest/Leeching The Light/Instant Fusion + Wattsquirrel/Wattwoodpecker/Wattrain</li> </ul> 4 card OTKs: <ul>  	<li>Kaiju + Wattsquirrel/Wattwoodpecker + Leeching The Light + Wattkey/Wattrain</li> </ul> The deck is also fairly consistent thanks to Small World and Mystic Mine-protected Left Arm Offering.  The side deck is to switch strategies into a going first deck. The goal is to get out Zap Mustung, Mystic Mine, and Ojama Trio. Lock your opponent out of attacking, monster effects, and special summoning. Wattchimera is the win condition here."

An average board will end on a level 7 or 8 synchro with beyond, i:p, and halq.  Satellite Warrior can be made with a level 5 dragster(after a negate activation) and a wonder magician made with halq or with a level 8 synchro and formula synchron made with halq."

Use Snake Rain or Ogdoadic monsters to send each other to GY.  Keurse must be sent to the GY at all costs as it's main combo starter. Send it from Deck with Nauya or Rain or from hand with Ramifications, Rain or Zohah.  Here is how it goes with just Nunu and any other Reptile in your hand (Ipiria, Vennominon, Medusa...) and opponent doesn't open handtrap.  Use Nunu to send Zohah, and retrieve it by discarding anything (better if it's Reptile).  Summon King of the Feral Imps with Nunu and Zohah.  Search for Nauya  if you didn't have it in your hand to send Keurse to the GY if its not there already or for Nunu to fill GY with other Reptiles so you have 5 with different names.  Keurse sends King of Feral Imp to GY and revives Nauya which searches Lily.  Lily sends Reptilianne Coatl and revives it.  Synchro Summon Geomathmech Magma then Synchro Summon Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin in Extra Monster Zone.  Use effect to Summon tokens on both sides.  Link Summon Reprodocus using Synchro and 1 Token that's either in center or far left or far right monster zone.  Reprodocus must point to token on your side from either Extra Monster Zone you summon it to.  Use effect and declare change type to Reptile.  Use 2 tokens to summon Reptilianne Echidna under Reprodocus.  Use last 2 tokens to summon I:P Masquerena next to Echidna.  Use Reprodocus and Masquerena to Summon Avramax to the extra monster zone.  Search 5 with Echidna, Scylla, Nyamini, Coatl, Lamia and Black Mamba.  Use Coatl to SS itself and Lamia, Scylla and Nyamini.  Link away Echidna and Nyamini into Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll.  Revive Nyamini.  Synchro Summon Hydra with Coatl and Nyamini and draw 5 cards.  Synchro Summon Melusine with Hydra and Lamia.  Special Summon Black Mamba.  Link Summon Alien Shocktrooper with Mamba and Scylla.  Set traps you got from draws, or activate Ogdoadic Continious Spell if you got it.  If you got Arasia and have Vennominon in your GY, SS Arasia and equip Vennominon.  With Trap Trick, Heavy Storm Duster or opponent's S/T Removal you can easily summon Vennominaga the following turn, protected by Avramax and Alien Links that can stun, combine it with Melusine and Recoil and your opponent will watch as their monsters change sides or as their ATK turns to 0.  Even if opponent uses handtrap and stops your combo you can still make Melusine and defend yourself with traps for a turn so you have enough Reptiles in GY for Vennominon to sweep."

I even proved Youtubers  (I kinda needed to say that let's head into card explanation)  <hr />  MONSTER CARDS  1x Albion, the shrouded dragon: you can send any branded from deck or hand to GY to use these cards affect most of the time we send branded retribution to add branded spell/trap from GY to our hand, but you can also send branded opening to protect your fusion monsters, one of the important effects of this card is if you send branded card from your hand you can SP this card from hand or GY and it will treat as fallen of Albaz which is really becoming handi the times you summon Albion and dragoon you can sp this card and go into Alba-Lenatus and in end phase add or set branded spell/traps which in this kinda case I set branded separation.  1x: Ad Libitun of Despia: if you use this card for the fusion summon you can sp 1Despai or 1 fusion monster which is banished or in GY which is broken.  The reason for not using Dramature of Despia is that the card only gives you free negate which is not useful 60% time so logic says it needs to get removed but if you are a new Albaz player you need to play Dramature instead of Ad libitum ( this is for starters only )  3x Aluber the jester of Despia: the only thing gonna say about this card is you can't use both effects at the same turn so be careful full you can also sp this card by the effect of branded opening to add any branded spell/trap from deck to your hand.  2x Fallen of Albaz: people usually say 2 copies are extenders yes it's actually is but not for starters if you are a starter play 3 copies of Albaz, if this card is ns or sp you can use only this card and cards your opponent controls for fusion summoning, if you dealing with dragon boards you only need to set this card and summon Alba-Lenatus :)  2x the Springans Kitt: this card at 2 copies is all enough ( you can't do anything with 1 copy ), one of the important effects of this card is you can even branded spell/trap which is banished or in GY which makes this card more OP but you have to replace one card from hand to your deck ( fair enough cost ), well after you used branded retribution and kinda wast all fallen of Albaz monsters in extra you gonna add branded retribution by kitt's effect to bring those resources back.  1X incredible Ecclesia: this card can be free to waste your opponent negates also you can add this card from GY to hand if a fusion monster is sent to GY. basically, one copy is needed ( we don't want to make Albaz angry XD)  1x goddess with the third eye: why not another famous card reason is our field spell if fairy leaves the field you get to sp level 8 or higher fusions from GY, you might say but this card is getting banished at the End, yes but you sp with branded separation.  1x Tri-brigade Mercouier: the only thing that I'm going to say is if you banish this card with Albion you can add one card list fallen of Albaz.  2x Despian Tragedy: if this card is sent to GY or banish you can add one Despia monster to your hand, I prefer to send this card to GY, cuz this card sets you branded spell/trap from GY, also sometimes when you have enough back up you don't need to use this card effect when you sent to GY, cuz in that case if you discard the branded card you can set it that turn ( you can only use one of the effects of this card ).  Break time.....  <hr />  2x Ash  1x droll 2x Ghost belle ( this deck can use a max 8 hand traps) .it's up to you, playing more hand traps doesn't make a player better.  <hr />  SPELL CARDS  3x branded fusion: the only card you might want to see in hand it also locks you into fusions.  3x Branded Opening: discard 1 card and sp one Despia monster or add it to your hand, it also locks you into fusions.  1x Despia, the theater of Branded: fusion summon by using monsters on the field or hand you can't fusion summon lower than level 8.  1x Branded in Red + 1x Branded in white: these 2 together work amazing 2 branded in red doesn't make you play better ( being quick play spell isn't good at 100% times ), sometimes branded in white is more needed than the Red one.  1x Branded lost: this card is broken, if you fusion summon you can add one card that lists fallen of Albaz, also fusion monsters can not be targeted it ( basically the reason why Titaniklad is not in the extra deck )  1x Foolish Burial: you can send Tragedy to GY, and you know the rest, the reason why we playing 2 Tragedy is cuz sometimes you draw the only one you have but the tragedy at 2 is all enough.  2x Dark ruler no more + 1x droplet: you asking why 2 rulers and 1 droplet well you will understand if you face with Floowanereeze.  2x Super poly: why not 3 due we got our 3rd super poly and it is Branded Exile.  1x Called by grave + 1x Crossout  <hr />  TRAP CARDS  1x Branded Separation: this card is the most OP card in the deck, you can tribute one fusion monster or 1 fallen of Albaz fusion monster and sp 2 cards from both players banished zone or GY to your field ( imagine you tribute Mirror jade after you used and sp Albaz and another Mirror jade and you can Sp free card from opponent GY &lt; Majestic dragon anyone, totally awesome anyone &gt; yup this card is OP ).  1x Branded Exile: sp 1 Despian monster or 1 fusion monster and fusion summon by using both fields, fusion Materials will get banished ( time to banish Destiny HERO plasma or Dark Law XD ).  1x Branded Retribution: banish this card from GY, add one branded card from GY to hand, and also it's back when you wasted your resources ( explained in Albion the shrouded dragon and the Springans Kitt ).  Break time.....  <hr />  EXTRA DECK  1x Chimera: draw and pop what is better than this ( be targetable part since we don't have real poly is sad YOLO ).  1x Red-eyes Dark Dragoon: we all know this card so  2xMirror jade: you can only control 1 mirror jade on the field.  1x Starving Venom fusion: people forget this card's second effect and still wonder why you can target one level 5 or higher copy the effect which is really hard to deal with you copy Baronne if they negate their board goes bye-bye.  1x Predaplant Dragostapelia: free negate since we playing &lt;there can be only one&gt;.  1x Lubellion the searing dragon: send any dark monster with Albaz, like Tragedy or Albion the shrouded dragon, and sp this and sp one level 8 or lower fusion monster.  1x Alba-Lenatus the abyss dragon: this card is broken explained all in Albion the shrouded dragon.  1x Despian Quaeritis: reduce all monster attacks to zero except level 8 or higher fusions, if this card leaves the field cuz of opponent cards you can sp Fallen of Albaz or 1 Despian monster from your deck.  1x Sprind the iron dash dragon: we usually use it to send it to GY, who knows might be an sp target then we add Springans Kitt with it during the end phase.  2x Masquerade the blazing dragon: due to burn damage, so go brrrrrrrr  2x Albion, the branded dragon: send goddess with the third eye and Albaz to sp dragoon, and you know the rest so  1x Predaplant Verte Anaconda: of course to summon mirror jade at least becomes handi  <hr />  Finally last part  SIDE DECK  2x Token collector: we are all tired of the brave token ( when become brave again, and why ??)  1x Harpie feather duster + 1x Twin twister + 1x Red reboot: Eldilich cry much you can :)  1x Necro banshee + 1x Zombie world: the best lockdown against many decks, including our bird friends  1x Mudragon: just target for super poly  2x droll and lock bird: well another way to stop Floowanereeze under Dimensional Shifter.  2x Triple Tactics Talent: you side when you go first  1x Nibiru: a cross out the target and also a good hand trap due  2x there can be only one: actually, since this deck might be only best to play this trap you can play 3 copies including one copy in the deck instead of the forbidden droplet.  IT'S OVER.  <hr />  Big thanks if you read it till here, again this was my best deck, but deep down its duelist itself makes the deck better, this deck is one of AGGRO decks which means you can't learn this deck by watching Combos cuz it makes you be weaker, actually this was a problem when tri-brigades came out some people didn't know how this deck can be meta or same works with Prank-Kids so practice Branded deck on your own way and get better. big thanks again everyone see you in the next decklist, which might be a Mixed Libromancer deck.

You branded fusion sending a metaphys and albaz, you summon albion the branded dragon, you fuse the metaphys and the fallen of albaz from the graveyard and summon either brigand or sprind boom you have a banished metaphys.  Any other ideas are welcome!  (mirrorjade is a wyrm so you can use it for high spirits and discard a metaphys!)"

Get your cook (Number 59: Crooked Cook) out and wait for the Final Countdown clock to tick down. While you wait for the Final Countdown, you can use the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus for clearing opponent threats. You only draw about 10 times after activating Final Countdown, so I don't expect to lose to deck out, but if you are scared of that, then just add a Marron. The Summoner Monk is probably the weirdest card in this deck, since you can't make Crooked Cook with him and the Right-Hand Shark, but then it is a good thing Buzzsaw Shark is a Level 4. Just summon Monk, summon Buzzsaw Shark from deck, make Almiraj with the Monk, tribute that monster of for it's effect, (which does nothing this time) then summon Right-Hand Shark and lastly the Cook. Another thing to note about this deck is, it doesn't care about Maxx ""C"", or to be more precise does a Maxx ""C"" not affect this deck's gameplan at all. The opponent can get 4 free draws, and we won't care. Ash Blossom and Effect Veiler are the big hand trap counters to this deck, so hit them with Called By The Grave and Crossout Designator. As for the Extra Deck. Well, just fill it up with the cards you think will counter you. You only need 1-3 Crooked Cooks, and 1-2 Salamangreat Almirajs. The rest of the space can be used to whatever.  As for the weaknesses for this deck. There are a lot, but bricking is happily not one of them. (the deck has 13 cards that lead to cook, so that gives you a 10% chance of bricking) Kaijus are the biggest counter to this deck. A single Kaiju will make you forfeit, since you have no counter to it. Piercing and direct attacks are another big one, but the Ghost Reapers and Kaijus should help somewhat with those.  As for the matchups, we have Toons, Prank Kids and Blue-Eyes Max builds as the worst. The only thing stopping a Blue-Eyes Chaos Max Dragon in this deck is a Kaiju, but you will still take 7600 HP damage from a single attack, so you will probably be long dead before being able to use the Kaiju. On the other hand, does some decks not have a single out for this deck. I am talking about Drytron, Adamancipators, Virtual World esc. on the pretext that you are going first."

And to that I say: ""There are other Light Warrior themed decks?""  I have always tried to make some sort of deck that used Poker Knights with something else that is nice. And that is where Heroics come into play.  Your main goal with this deck is to swarm the field to go into Extra Deck plays via Poker Knights or Heroics.  The Pokers are the Base of this deck, seeing as most of their support is here, which act as the metaphorical sterring wheel to the burning car that is this deck. Heroics are the Extenders, because the rest of their Archetype are don't wanna work or are bad (usually both), which can enable more Extra Deck shenanigans for you. Puppet Pawn is here for one reason only and that is Fusion Fodder but I'll explain later. BLS is here because Queen's Knight exists and by god does the new BLS work wonders here (Well... about as many wonders as BLS can make).  Isolde, which is basically in every Warrior deck now, should ALWAYS search BLS (or fucken whatever if you already have the blue brick menace in your grubby little hands) on link summon and use the equip spell to get Knuckle Knife out there. Jarngreipr is there for protection against basically most threats. Arcana Extra Joker is there to help negate things and enable a potential comeback on death (unless you get cucked by negates yourself). Tenyi is there in case the heart of the cards is a dick. Starliege for when you cuck yourself via Joker's Straight. Constellar for the rare occasion that you land on Jack's Knight and Knukle Knife. Arcana Knight Joker exists in there if you need to beat over something and Gilti-Gearfried because you are using two different Attributes and he is a good card.  So the Strategy: Face Card Fusion should 9 times out of 10 be used to get Gilti-Gearfried out with any Poker Knight (preferably from your hand) and Puppet Pawn (preferably form your deck). Then you can banisch the Pawn form your GY to get any EARTH Warrior (so basically the heroics) from your deck into your hand. Morning Star searches Envoy, Envoy searches Knuckle Knife and with him you can either go for Link or Jarngreipr and use his effect and extend play ad nauseum. BLS can be used on your second turn to get a Ritual Spell and summon him in order to STORM THE GATES. Note: Depending on the Situation you can use Advand Ritual Art instead of Super Soldier Ritual if you fancy it.  You also don't have to worry too much about getting cucked since a good handful of Poker support recycles itself with the base trio.  In conclusion: Deck is good. Play. Pls."

Paired up with the Legendary Fisherman support card Sea Stealth Attack, you can protect your spell/traps by remove your own token when you opponent activates an effect. Since the field spell activates on a new chain, both conditions for its activation 1. your opponent activates an effect and 2. you not controling a token *when it is able to activate.* That is why I also run Spiritual Water Art - Aoi as well as getting hand information and disruption. But being able to search archetypal cards is nothing to *what* the cards are you're searching. Both Phantasm Spiral Battle and Phantasm Spiral Power are the best search targets in a more controlling type of build. From-hand targeted destructions with Battleare still nice, and effect negation/attack lowering of power is arguably better. I like to think of it as a searchable Effect Veiler that can be used at any point of the turn, on either player's turn, includimg the damage step because of the stat point modulation. The equip spells are good ways to turbo out the 2900/2900 big chungus from almost everywhere as well as providing nice piercing, burn damage, or more discard against your opponent. This build is very enemic and made to be a budget Master Duel list. Includes to beef it up are a playset of Fossil Dig to search Megalosmasher X, the card Heat Wave to lock both of you (but mainly your opponent) from summoning effect monsters, and Card of Demise to dig further for your key cards of the field spell and either Sea Stealth Attack or a normal summon."

After activating it, you cannot use ANY Spells or Traps for the rest of the DUEL other than Sekka's Light. While it's in the GY, you can also banish it to recycle a monster from your hand back into the deck and draw a card.  For the decklist, we have our Fur Hire package of 2x Rafale, 2x Wiz, 2x Dyna, 2x Sagitta, 2x Seal, 3x Beat, 2x Helmer, 2x Filo, and 3x Folgo. For the rest of the Main Deck, we have 2x Nibiru, 3x Ash Blossom, 3x Ghost Belle, 3x Ghost Ogre, 3x Maxx C, 3x Droll, and 3x Veiler for Handtraps, and 3x Sekka for Spells, and for the rest of the Extra Deck, we have 1x Chengying, 1x Baronne, 1x Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, 1x Borreload Savage, 1x Chaos Ruler, 1x Draco Berserker, 1x Formula Synchron, 1x Underworld Goddess, 1x Accesscode, 1x Knightmare Unicorn, 1x Halqifibrax, and 1x Masquerena."

The decklist has a standard Invoked package of 3x Aleister, 3x Meltdown(and 1x Terraforming for it), 2x Invocation, 3x Mechaba, 1x Augoeides, 1x Purgatrio, and 1x Raidjin. It also has a typical Branded package of 1x Dramaturge, 1x Ad Libitum, 3x Aluber, 2x Albaz, 2x Branded Lost, 3x Branded Fusion, 2x Branded in Red, 2x Branded Opening, 1x Mirrorjade, 2x Lubellion, 1x Alba-Lenatus, 1x Quaeritis, 1x Albion, and 1x Masquerade. For the rest of the Main Deck, we have 2x Nibiru, 3x Ash Blossom, 2x Ghost Belle, and 2x Veiler for Handtraps, 1x Called by, 3x Allure, and for the rest of the Extra Deck we have 1x Underworld Goddess, and 1x Verte.  As someone who has always been a fan of the Invoked archetype, seeing it getting a new way to be playable in the modern metagame makes me want to play it again."
