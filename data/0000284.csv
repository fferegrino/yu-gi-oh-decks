From there, you can use the attack position Telefon's effect to summon the Telefon in the grave. This will let you link off the Telefon whose effect you just used before you can use the new Telefon's effect to resummon the linked-off Telefon.

I'm In Danger! Anti-Meta. OTK.,"Hello everyone, and welcome back to the latest installment of Gren Maju Danger Kaiju!  While I did not post a deck to for the previous format, Pot Of Desires being at 1 kinda hindered the deck, Fairy Tale Snow and a 3rd Eater Of Millions didn't quite have the same impact as 2 Desires. With it now being brought back to 2 gives the deck a reasonable chance to compete again.  The only real significant change to the main deck, as everything else is still the same as before, is the return of Super Poly. Not only is it decent VS Branded Despia, but it offers the deck a way to break through ABC Therion, as it typically ends on Masqerena and Buster making it vulnerable to Dragostapelia and also can make holes in anything using Adventurer and Baronne. Lone Twisters because I really couldn't think of anything else to put except maybe use Snow. For more in depth explanations of the rest of the deck, feel free to look through my previous builds for inspiration and insight.  The Extra deck is as before except the  addition of 4 Super Poly targets. Dragostapelia is literally immense, as non Adventurer ABC Therion is forced to lose all it's on field monster interruptions (Super Poly IP and Buster + quick eff Dragostapelia against  Regulus) and also puts work in against Branded Despia. Starving Venom works in tandem with Drago for double Dark, Mudragon typically for Gryphon and Baronne plays and Earth Golem Ignister for anything Cyberse related and also throws Shuirag/Apolussa under the bus while playing against Tri-Brigade.  Ra Sphere and D-Shifter. The two MVP 's of the side deck, that will continue to be relevant until at least Splight and Tearlaments have been power crept well into the future. These 2 cards cause literal carnage. Ra Sphere says bye bye to ABC Therion, and anything that plays Adventurer or simply spams mass monster interruptions. Also is a pretty funny psychological weapon against Floowandereze (Floow players take note!) If Floow players have Statue, Empen + Dreaming Town, simply declare you want to go into the battle phase while holding Ra Sphere. You pretty much force the Dreaming Town and the Floow player to summon Apex to combat the implied threat of Evenly Matched. Because the game state has changed, you can now choose not to go into Battle Phase and simply Ra Sphere over the 3 monsters.  D-Shifter is the opposite of Ra Sphere.  Rather than allowing your opponents to commit resources, you can just stop them wanting to commit resources. 2 Twisters , 1 Super poly and Reboot for further board breaking and OTK potential. D barrier swaps places with DD Ground, because while DD ground is solid, the meta is pretty Branded and Swordsoul heavy, and DD ground doesn't entirely stop either from playing (Branded have Lubelion to shuffle fusion material back into the deck,  and certain monsters of theirs benefit from the banish and normal Swordsoul plays that don't involve Tenyi are pretty much unaffected as you run no handtraps other than Shifter). TCBOO rounds off the deck floodgating monotype decks.  &nbsp;"

The only way I could find to make use of Seiyaryu was to use the Hieratic monsters. Thankfully, the Hieratics actually do synergize with the Starry Knights because of Starry Knight Astel. Starry Knight Astel can tribute a Hieratic to summon Radiant Seiyaryu from the hand and also a normal dragon from the deck. Seiyaryu can be summoned from the deck to make a level 7 XYZ and Labradorite Dragon can be summoned and synchro'd with Astel for Master Flare Hyperion. The ideal turn 2 combo is:  Hand: Radiant Seiyaryu (searchable), Starry Knight Astel (searchable), Dragon of Su (or Tefnuit), Dragon of Eset (searchable), Holy Knight Sky (4x w/terraforming), Monster Reborn/Silver's Cry (4x). Normal summon Eset, tribute for Su, pop a S/T, special summon Laboradorite, overlay for Atum, detach Laboradorite, special summon REDMD, REDMD effect to special summon Eset, activate Holy Knight Sky, use effect to normal summon Starry Knight Astel, use Starry Knight Astel's effect to tribute Eset, special summon Radiant Seiyaryu from hand, pop a card, and special summon Seiyaryu from deck, overlay them into Voloferniges, link Atum and REDMD into Hieratic Seal, reborn Laboradorite, and finally Synchro Astel and Laboradorite into Masterflare Hyperion. This board packs 4 interruptions, Voloferniges' quick effect can destroy 1 face-up card, Masterflare Hyperion can banish 1 card on the field, and Hieratic Seal can tribute itself to bounce a card and then special summon Radiant Seiyaryu which can pop a card for a 4th interruption. I feel like one time I managed to pull this off with a Return of the Dragon Lords but I forgot how I did it lol.  Side deck is just some alternate options I considered."

Why you might be asking, well I simply wanted to see how many floodgates and fun legal cards you could squeeze into a deck while still having a win condition, the win condition being leaving your locals unscathed. These are legal cards so we should be allowed to play them right? Smile.  The goal is to turbo out Utopia Double, and setup skill drain and every floodgate under the sun. Utopia Double's double effect is not an effect that can be negated by skill drain, and there for your opponent now has to deal with a 5000 ATK monster with no out, unless they draw it lol! Which is why you setup anti spell fragrance, mystic mine, d barrier and artifact sanctum by simply drawing them because drawing the 3 of cards is easy!  Waking the Dragon package is to punish them for ""drawing the out"" by forcing them to draw yet another out! Fun for the whole family! What? This isn't a monkey flip deck it takes skill!

You must run 3 copies of all true draco spell and trap cards to make them consistent. The true draco monster cards can be flexed to meet your needs or the meta, but 8 tends to be enough. You can run metaverse in order to search drogonic heritage but I find it too slow for the meta. Demise and Pot of Duality are a must at 3 to ensure consistency. Pot of desire can be changed to any other card that boosts consistency, but I prefer to use pot of desires.  This is a hard going first deck. The strategy is simple, draw until you get get a floodgate and a negate, if you don't you get put in a very bad spot. Going second and not starting with a floodgate or a negate involve the same strategy. You use your true draco monsters to search for the spell to bait backrow and traps in order to bait negates or in order to disrupt the opponent.  What makes the deck powerful is the lack of a need to special summon and the powerful destruction effects of the true draco spell and trap cards in order to bait backrow or monster effects. That being said the counter to this deck is losing the coinflip, or the opponent having strong removal that does not destroy the backrow, such as their can only be one.  &nbsp;"

Triple Tactics Talen was a last minute inclusion that won me at least three games, definitely a good card to have.  Only 3 Ash Blossom for hand traps (besides Mercourier) was good. Using Ash to stop Fateful Adventure or Branded Fusion is great. Side deck has more matchup-specific handtraps but there's not much room for siding. Usually it makes sense to replace Ash with a more specific hand trap like token collector. Some other cards to consider when siding are the third Albaz, Albion, Mercourier, and triple tactics.  Mystic Mine and Anti-Spell Fragrance are the biggest issues for the deck. Going forward I want to at least main deck one backrow removal card for Mine and consider blind siding in backrow removal to hedge my odds against losing to a random D. Barrier or ASF."

Though their Main Deck monsters are primarily lackluster in power and effects, the true power of this archetype lies in the Extra Deck. The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la, respectively, can special summon the other if you control no other monsters, making them excellent starters, and the deck has a lot of ways to search them out in their archetypal Spells and Traps.  On your 1st turn, your goal is to summon E*T Ki-sikil first, special summon a Lil-la from your GY, then make E*T Lil-la, special summon E*T Ki-sikil from your GY to draw a card, you can then make either Trouble Sunny or Unchained Abomination depending on your preference or whether you go 1st or 2nd, or if you have Evil*Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, the Main Deck Boss Monster, in your hand or GY, you could make that as well.  The Main Deck Ki-sikil and Lil-la are Cyberse Type, meaning that they can be searched with Cynet Mining, their alternate cards, Frost and Treat are Aqua and Zombie, respectively, and their Extra Deck monsters and E*T Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la are Fiend Type, and most of them lock you into Fiend monsters from the Extra Deck. So thankfully, Unchained Abomination, the Boss Monster of the Unchained archetype, happens to work very well with the Live/Evil*Twins as it is also a Fiend.  For the decklist, we have a Twins package of 1x E*T Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la, 3x L*T Ki-sikil, 2x L*T Ki-sikil Frost, 3x L*T Lil-la, 1x L*T Lil-la Treat, 3x L*T Sunny's Snitch, 3x Secret Password, 3x L*T Home, 1x E*T Challenge, 2x E*T Trouble Sunny, 3x E*T Ki-sikil, and 3x E*T Lil-la, for the rest of the Main Deck, we have a Handtrap lineup of 2x Nibiru, 3x Ash Blossom, 2x D.D. Crow, 2x Veiler, and 3x Infinite Impermanence, 3x Parallel eXceed, 3x Cynet Mining, 1x Avarice, and 1x Called By, for the rest of the Extra Deck, we have 1x Unchained Abomination, 1x Underworld Goddess, 1x Accescode, 1x Knightmare Unicorn, 1x Knightmare Phoenix, 1x Halqifibrax, and 1x Masquerena"

Main Strategy: It is a deck that is similarly strong when played first or second, but has different weaknesses for either. When going first, you are at the risk of being Kaiju'd (or other similar effects) on your opponent's first turn, excluding your boss monster from the field, and being at the mercy of your opponent, but if playing second, your opponent can have many negate monsters and/or traps to break your combo, which would leave you in a very vulnerable state. In your starting turn, what you want to do, is generally to try to special summon both Cobalt Sparrow and Celestine Wagtail, although the latter isn't neessary if you drew Bird Sanctuary. You can do this using the effects of Bird Call, Turquoise Wabbler, Saphire Swallow, One for One, Summon Storm, Swallow's Nest, and from the GY with Beryl Canary and Turquoise Wabler. Then search for either monsters to extend your combo, or Bird Sanctuary to finish it."

For full combos, watch: https://youtu.be","Post may 2022 Banlist. This is an update to my Inferno Salamangreat Deck.  For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on Youtube for more info.  This Salamangreat deck incorporates Decode Talker Heatsoul. Just one tip: in case you you get Nibirued while you hold Salamangreat Circle in hand and you control a Salamangreat monster that was linked using a monster with its same name as material, you can negate the Nibiru by using Salamangreat Circle if it's the only monster you control, or at least protect that monster from being being tributed if you have multiple monsters.  https://youtu.be/AGEHsINz7m8"

If not stoped, Super Poly and Dragostapellia and Triphyovertum are a problem for opponent, maybe with a follow up of predaplast but only maybe if you are lucky. Your strategy is to get out Stapellia as fast as possible if you are going first, or if going second just do not ask anything, summon Chimerafflesia and banish their monsters. Don't ask, just do it."

Fuse into your many strong fusion monster whether that be through Super Poly, Branded Fusion, the newly released Branded Banishment, etc. This deck the more I play it is more about the grind game if anything and you look at the side and say ""why are you not playing the Patchwork engine in the main deck"" and my answer to that is because I find it to brick WAY TOO OFTEN now, that may all change because we have access to Branded Fusion but my point still stands  BUT I did put it in here because it is a nice game two change where my opponent may think ""oh ok so she is not playing the Patchwork Engine huh?"" then you start game two and just give them a big ol surprise when they see the engine being played. I also run the Zombie World package for Flunder matches, potentially Salamangreat if that deck sees more play because of 3 Circle and Miragestallio being a thing or just decks that rely on a specific monster type to function. You also see Eldich there and may be thinking to yourself ""why is he there?"" well the answer is very simple- we have Zombie World out; everything is a zombie now so Eldich is just a free ooga booga beatstick who can go up to 3500. The reason I run two Necroworld Banshee is for insurance in case the first one gets negated. Now, the biggest eye raiser is of course the Sales Ban inclusion and the reason for that is because it FORCES an interaction to happen to your opponent in case they want to activate a card I call with it- example: Activate Sales Ban. Call Ash Blossom. Either they use the ash or they aint using it for the turn. I do think that Crossout is also a VERY valid and option for the deck so take this as you will. I hope you enjoyed this summary of mine and I hope you like the decklist. One final note- if I had to make a choice for the deck I would either switch the Snow or Alba-Lenatus for a Necrodragon because that is the best Super Poly target under Zombie World (plz Konami reprint the card already along with Snow)."

Going 1st, dimensional barrier can come in clutch for those game 1 situations where you recognize the opponent's deck right away.  Siding in sanctum/scythe and DDG, you're near guaranteed to pull something to lock your opponent down before they can even play.  If you don't pull any of that, following the standard combo set of the new predaplant cards will often times get you into a board tough to beat over regardless, especially if you end on dragoon or DPE alongside dragostapelia or mirrorjade.  Going 2nd, siding in cards like raigeki and kaiju in place of D-Barrier and 3 others is ideal for breaking your opponent's board.  Typically I go with removing 1 sundew, one allure, and 1 branded opening since I'm notorious for opening an aluber or branded fusion regardless.  You can also opt to side out the allure of darkness's instead.  The DPE and Dragoon package's in the deck aren't bricks either.  Being able to use them as dark fusion targets in hand just further adds to the potential of the cards and then using cards like albion and lubellion to use them in grave gets you into dragoon or DPE that much easier."

I tried other versión with Therion King Regulus and his field, in a more control based with better turns 1, but I like more this OTK version, I think I'll be switching over this two versions of the deck analizing my local's meta.  Only tried in YgoPro because with work and girlfriend, I don't have much time to spend in tournaments and stuff, but I have faith in this version, looking for someone who wants to try this deck.  I'm looking for the optimal way to use Cyber Dragons and try to win things with them. So, enjoy this full packed of anxiety for winning fast deck."
