Majestic Mechs, along with their boss monsters Pyrotech Mech - Shiryu and Malevolent Mech - Goku En, all send themselves to the Graveyard during the End Phase of the turn they are summoned. This deck attempts to circumvent this by playing cards such as Axe of Fools and Tethys, Goddess of Light to negate the Majestic Mech effects, keeping them on the field. It also runs D.D. Sprite as a way to cheat out some of the tribute dependent Majestic Mech monsters while also serving as a level 1 Tuner that can go into powerful synchro cards like Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier, Stardust Dragon, Black Rose Dragon, Colossal Fighter, and more.

This means optional ""when"" trigger effects cannot activate if they would trigger upon being sent. Not really a ruling that comes up in modern Yu-Gi-Oh but it does mean that everything I said the deck can do can in fact not be done. So yeah, Neo-Spacians, not that great. Who would've thought (technically it's Cross Porter who's subpar, still carry much love for my space buds!)</span>  <span>Anywhoskidaddle, you're not here to talk about Neo-Spacians. You're here for <span>Dark World x Drill Warrior</span>.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Dark World</span>  <span>Most Dark World monsters function similarly. If they're <strong>discarded</strong> to the <strong>GY</strong> by a <strong>card effect</strong> (keywords matter) they trigger their effect and if they were discarded by an opponent's card effect instead they will - when resolving said effect - perform something on top of it. Most of the time you'll be the one discarding your cards tho.</span>  <span>Exception to the rule is <span><a data-name=""Brron, Mad King of Dark World"">Brron, Mad King of Dark World</a></span>. Brron discards a card when inflicting battle damage. It's a way to trigger your other cards effects. He's nothing too special but nothing to scoff at with 1800 ATK.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World"">Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Sillva, Warlord of Dark World"">Sillva, Warlord of Dark World</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World"">Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World</a></span> all Special Summon themselves when discarded.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Broww, Huntsman of Dark World"">Broww, Huntsman of Dark World</a></span> draws a card.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Gren, Tactician of Dark World"">Gren, Tactician of Dark World</a> </span>destroys spell/traps</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Kahkki, Guerilla of Dark World"">Kahkki, Guerilla of Dark World</a></span> destroys monsters.</span>  <span>Their Spells and Traps facilitate that strategy. <span>Dark World Dealings</span> draws both you and your opponent a card and then makes you both discard. <span>Dark World Lightning</span> destroys a set card (that's both backrow and monsters) and then makes you discard one.</span>  <span>So they have removal, swarming capabilities but sadly need very specific hands to do all that and as you might've realised, discarding cards doesn't really win you the grind game.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Drill Warrior</span>  <span>Here's where it gets interesting.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Volcanic Shell"">Volcanic Shell</a></span> keeps cards in hand for discards and most importantly allows for Drill Warrior plays.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Quickdraw Synchron""><span>Quickdraw Synchron</span></a> allows for a few, very strong Synchro plays. Keep in mind that Quickdraw doesn't trigger your Dark World monsters. With Shell you can summon Drill Warrior.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Drill Warrior"">Drill Warrior</a> </span>has two effects. With the latter it discards a card (when resolving the effect, triggering your Dark World cards) and banish itself. During your next SP it returns to your field and adds you a monster from your GY to your hand. This gives you incredible recursion.</span>  <span>You can 1) keep adding back Sillva and Goldd to summon them again every turn, b) add back Gren or Kahkki to destroy a spell/trap or monster every. single. turn. or c) add back Quickdraw Synchron to summon another Drill Warrior since each copy can use their effects once per turn, allowing you to double down on a) and b).</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Generic Cards</span>  <span>I won't go over every single Edison staple but <span><a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a></span> can search any part of the Drill Warrior engine, <span><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a></span> allows for more Synchro plays and your playing a DARK deck with good control over your GY so <span><a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a></span>'s in here, too.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Honorary Mentions</span>  <span><a data-name=""Dark Deal"">Dark Deal</a></span> <span>is a Dark World card (although not by name) that forces your opponent to make you discard. This is considered to be discarded by your opponent's card effect and triggers the additional effect of your Dark World monsters. But the discard is random so it's a little too hit or miss for me.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Gateway to the Dark World"">Gateway to the Dark World</a></span> is also seeing play in some decks. But summoning a 2300 ATK body tops on your opponents turn that requires a little setup is just not worth the investment imo.</span>  <span>Once Shell is in rotation it's stay in rotation and with Dealings and Allure you have quite the drawing power. However if you want even more consistency for Quickdraw you can play <span><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></span> to search it.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Rulings</span>  <span>Dark World Lightning has to destroy a set card. If the card is flipped face-up (a monster by card effect or the targetted backrow is chained for example) Lightning will not destroy the card and therefore not discard.</span>  <span>When Drill Warrior mandatorily Special Summons itself it then adds a monster afterwards, meaning your opponent cannot use Torrential Tribute here.

Going first, the aim is to resolve Branded Fusion; having a gamma in hand is always really great because branded fusion is an ash magnet. Normal Summon Aluber to get a copy of Branded Fusion, activate Branded Fusion, Send Shaddoll Beast and Albaz to summon Lubellion, use Lubellion's effect to summon Mirrorjade, and get a free draw off Beast. Use Mirrorjade's effect to send Apkallone to the GY and banish the Aluber. Activate Apkallone's effect in the GY to get a copy to Schism to your hand. Set Schism and pass. On the opponent's draw phase, flip Schism, and banish Apkallone and Beast to summon Winda. Now your opponent is Winda locked and you still have 3 cards in hand, which could be hand traps or follow up plays. If the opponent manages to negate Winda's effect and still summon a full board and gets rid of Mirrorjade, on the end phase, all your opponent's monsters will be destroyed, leaving you a clear field to OTK, which is what cyber dragons do best.  Going second, assuming you have a Cyber Dragon core, that is a possible OTK. Normal summon Core to get Realm to your hand. Activate Realm to get a copy of Chimera and then normal summon Chimera using Realm's effect. Use Chimera's effect to pitch a spell/trap to get a copy of Power Bond. Link Core and Chimera into Sieger. Activate Power Bond, using Sieger on the field and banishing Core in the grave, which is made possible due to Chimera's effect, to summon Rampage with 4200 atk and the ability to pop two back row as well as attack thrice.  There is a small Dogmatika package in the deck as well which is really useful in certain situations. You can use Nadir Servant at the end of a turn to send Albion to search Branded Fusion for your next turn, or N'tss to pop a card, or even Omega to recycle cards from the GY. You can even use Mirrorjade's effect to send Titaniklad to search Ecclesia late game to secure an advantage. Ecclesia, which searches Fleur, is quite useful to keep in your hand and then slap down to negate an extra deck monster with the effect of Fleur. I don't use Punishment simply because I need to go into the extra deck every single turn.  &nbsp;"

But the January 2022 banlist, killed the deck by removing Simorgh (press F) and 2 copies of Recital Starling (also F, since the reverse OTK with double Starling + Nightingale was the deck's best win condition.) Losing her reduces so much the deck's consistency that I don't think it can be played going first anymore. So this is the version I came up with to go second. And a side deck for when you believe the opponent will make you go first. Alpha + Warbler is a nice synergy to start baiting negations, and he is also a way to put Recital Staring back in the extra deck (just keep in mind that targeting her to go back to the extra deck doesn't add up to the total of monsters from your opponent's field you can bounce back.). Wynn is really nice to give one more search to the deck if needed. Since Wynn + cobalt or wagtail is a nice way to extend by searching Warbler or Beryl canary. Elfobia is kinda cool when going first, with Emergency Teleport back at three we can summon her, lock the opponent with any bird in hand, and link her in the Harpie Conductor. Harpie's feather storm is still legal, so there's no reason not to use it here."

So, I wanna","I quite enjoy playing pure Melffy. This is the list I feel comfortable playing right before they get new support from Power of the Elements, which will help them a lot giving more disruptions. So, I wanna save this list I have nowadays to compare it with what I can come up with in the future. First of all, I consider it a control deck. Trying to generate advantage every turn, and disrupting the opponent on key points. And since I take it as a control deck, I believe Torrential Tribute is a really powerful card that fits really well into Melffy's strategy for three reasons: 1- Before the deck snowballs advantage, we end up having the field with just a few (or none) monsters, since they all come back to the hand, so wiping the field is not bad. 2- Even with we committed a lot to the field, 95% of our end boards consist of Beast-type monsters, which can get once-per-turn protection from destruction from Mellfy Hide-and-seek. 3- Psy-frame Gear Gamma is amazing in this deck, so if you activated it, you could wipe the field to make Driver go to the GY, and still have it available later.  The deck has 9 starters: 3x Obedience Schooled, 3x Rescue Cat and 3x Nimble Beaver. Kalantosa is the main form of disruption, by destroying cards."

Arianna searches Welcome to summon Lovely. If you already have some of those pieces, the field spell's good for recursion and turning Welcome into disruption. Or Ariane for followup Rank 4 plays or further draw.  Lord of the Heavenly Prison provides protection, a large body and followup: setting Extravagance or some situationally useful trap.  Outside of that, lots of purple cards. Ice Dragon's Prison and Storming Mirror Force are your only non-targeting options. Underworld Goddess in the extra deck is another possibility if you can amass enough monsters. Torrential + Strike or Storming + Strike to break established boards. Bottomless and Compulsory for simple, flexible single target removal. Imperm doesn't remove or proc your Labrynth but it's very good utility. And lastly, Punishment for an easy 2 for 1 (or even 3 with Lovely up)."

No Skill Drain, but Mind and Soul Drain to combat any shenanigans.  Rotate the copies out that aren't needed depending on you opponents deck  Extra deck is just fluff apart from Zeroboros and The Last Warrior"

I tested 25 random start hands with the ygoprodeck Deck Builder (Edit -&gt; shuffle OR Tools -&gt; Simulate Start-Hand) and got 20 times the goal reached, thanks to the draw cards (use Edit -&gt; shuffle to confirm drawing cards) so in my calc the deck has an efficient rate of <strong>80%</strong> if going first. here some turn 1 start hands (one Hand each row): <img src=""https://imageshack.com/i/pmhWem4Sp"" alt=""some Turn One Start Hands"" width=""574"" height=""636"" />  for the plays after turn one, i put in <a data-name=""Needle Worm"">Needle Worm</a> and <a data-name=""Morphing Jar"">Morphing Jar</a>, so second Goal is to mill the opponents Deck, but u can also play something else here  &nbsp;  * keep it simple, stupid!  &nbsp;"

Pilots are the ones that &ldquo;tag out&rdquo; - banish themselves - to special summon a higher level Kozmo monster from hand. These are mostly distinctive by the fact they are all psychics, and typically low level (ignoring Dark Lady.) Ships are much more self explanatory - Special summon them, then if they get destroyed you can special summon a pilot. Ships range from level 5 to 10.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are different ways to play Kozmo. Pure kozmo tends to focus on control/stun, while hybrids can combo off. For the ratio list, I will mark the typical ratios of Kozmo cards, though it&rsquo;s entirely down to the build you&rsquo;re trying to, pun intended, pilot.</p><p>𝙎𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙤𝙩𝙨</p><p>Tincan - The wincan. Can't beat the normal tincan set 2 pass. Gets you the pilots, and can tag out whenever.&nbsp;</p><p>Strawman - Excellent at looping destroyed ships, especially in Fire King variants.&nbsp;</p><p>Soartroopers - Brings back pilots in the grave, which is great if you're running a variant with a heavy extra deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Farmgirl - Our girl who can otk and get us a destroyer in the battle phase. Can be hard to deal battle damage with a 1k monster.</p><p>Goodwitch - Book of moon effect which can lock your opponent out of certain plays.&nbsp;</p><p>Wickedwitch - A fun stall card to get you through a turn with a decent attack stat.&nbsp;</p><p>Darklady - Monster negate quick effect, and can still tag out.</p><p>𝙎𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨</p><p>Sliprider - Pop effect for spells doesn't seem much, but popping town or Fire King Island can be a godsend for combos.</p><p>DOG Fighter - If you're playing a slower game it may be good for token generation, but in combos it can be difficult to pull off the token effect. Might be better to cut and run other ships.</p><p>Forerunner - No target, LP gain, beefy attack. Excellent to float into from destroyer.</p><p>Dark Destroyer - Our big boss. Free pop, with the same protection as forerunner.&nbsp;</p><p>Dark Eclipser - Trap negate, and is often one of the ships picked off tincan to add to the hand. It can't float, but still useful for the adding card.</p><p>𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙨</p><p>Kozmotown - One of the best field spells in the game. Hand fixing, adding back banished pilots and ships, and getting a free ship on destruction.</p><p>𝙎𝙪𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩, 𝙑𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙨</p><p>Emergency teleport: absolute staple in any build. Free pilot at no cost, since you can tincan before E-Tele resolves.</p><p>Storm Dragon&rsquo;s return: gives you back a ship or pilot!</p><p>Swords Of Revealing Light: gives you time to xyz summon or to get your field together.</p><p>𝙆𝙤𝙯𝙢𝙤 𝙆𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙤𝙝</p><p>Use astral Kuriboh to summon from your extra deck, All monsters levels in your extra deck match the monsters in your main deck needed to special summon use each one wisely.</p><p>Number 61 - Cannot be sent to the grave yard when attacked</p><p>There is also 2 main heavy xyz summon variants for this deck i like to use</p><p><strong>Level 7</strong></p><p>If you have a 2 level 7 monsters or astral kuriboh you can summon Number 42 and use his effect depending on the game you can win with this by summoning as many 2k monsters on the field as you can. You then can tribute those cards and link summon Word Gears and Turn number 42 into Zues.</p><p><strong>Level 8</strong></p><p>If you have 2 level 8 monsters or a astral kuriboh you can summon Number 97 and choose to go on the offensive or defensive.</p><p><strong>The offensive</strong></p><p>Summon Number 97 and take 2 dragon xyz summons one of them is special summoned and the other is used as a material. Summon Number 62 and use his effect to laydown life points on the field.</p><p><strong>The Defensive</strong></p><p>Summon Number 97 and take 2 dragon xyz summons one of them is special summoned and the other is used as a material.

The idea of this format is to keep it casual and run those ""bad"" Knights of Atlantis, Chazz (Ojama/Armed Dragon/VWXYZ), God Cards and many other casual decks. Basically approach this format as if you're playing on the playground and not at a local game shop for a tournament.  This format was also designed to be used with the Duel Disk toys licensed by Konami. YOU DO NOT NEED A DUEL DISK TO PLAY THIS FORMAT.  Due to this format being made with the Duel Disks in mind there are rules in line limiting certain cards that can't be used with a Duel Disk.  1-Other than the following rules, all other official TCG rules apply.  2-Due to this being made for a Duel Disk XYZ, PENDULUMS, and LINK MONSTERS ARE BANNED!  3- All cards are limited to 1 copy per deck EXCEPT for cards on this list, you can play 3 of anything on this list: https://tinyurl.com/AnimeFormatExceptions  4) Other than Xyz, Pendulum and Links no other cards are banned, but to balance Gameplay there is a Tier List You can only have 3 Cards on the A Tier List 5 Cards on the B Tier List 10 Cards on the C Tier List In your deck. https://tinyurl.com/FormatTierList  5)You can Normal Summon in face up defense like the Anime.  6) You can have up to 20 cards in the Extra Deck.

But they're such gas not sure why you would. Plays surprisingly well under a board but obv prefers to go first; a truly lucky hand can net you 3-4 negates and a starter can get you at least 2. I like drones because you can consistently make baronne and hotred if you see it; little extra but allows you to make amazing dragon or punisher over the HRDAKC if you need that kind of thing instead. Honestly, plays through hand traps decently.  Has great matchups in general; not a lot can play through the boards it spits out. Side deck is for going second almost exclusively.  Kagari also a little extra clutch being a machine typing for Regulus; had that come up a couple times and felt guuuud."

There is nothing more to improve. This deck has no straight combo. You also wanna get into your Crimson Resonator and use Level 4 Monsters to make red rising and bring back Crimson to activate it's effect to special summon up to 2 Resonators from your deck (or hand). If you have the ascator engine plus Crimson Resonator, you can special summon Crimson Resonator and then activate Ascator the Dawnwalker, discard one (Jet Synchron, Destrudo, Dangers, Red Familiar, Stygian Streetpatrol etc) and special summon itself plus Fire Ant Ascator from your deck (or hand) make Chaos Ruler and activate it's effect and then you can use Crimson Resonators second effect.  You can use Synkronresonators second effect multiple times per turn to bounce back resonators and discard them with the dangers to extend furthermore. You can also use Creation Resonator and Synkron Resonator to synchro summon, so you can add back Creation Resonator to special summon it again.  The goal of this deck is to get into Crimson Resonator as fast as possible, summon Chaos Ruler and use Red Rising Dragon multiple times. Also using Synkronresonator multiple times. Then you make boards like one or two Red Supernova Dragon and/or one or more Hot Red Abyss with Void Ogre Dragon.  It really depends on your opening hand, what you drawn into, what you will mill with Chaos Ruler and which resonator you special summon."

Lady of Lament gives you access to them while Labrynth gives you extra benefits when using your Traps, so they work nicely together.</span>  <span>1 <strong>Labrynth of the Silver Castle</strong>. This card prevents your opponent from responding to your Normal Trap activations with monster effects, it can re-set a Normal Trap from GY, and it can destroy a card your opponent controls or in their hand when a monster leaves the field by your Normal Trap's Effect. We only play 1 because it should realistically only be Summoned off of <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> or off of <strong>Labrynth Labyrinth</strong> if you do draw it. It cannot Summon itself, so it is a brick most of the time. 3 <strong>Labrynth Servant Arianna</strong> as this card searches a Labrynth card on Summon and it allows you to Draw 1 and then either Summon a Fiend from hand or Set 1 Spell/Trap from hand when a monster leaves the field by your Normal Trap. This is another good target for <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> as you would usually rather be using your Normal Summon for your Lady of Laments. 1 <strong>Labrynth Chandra</strong>. This card can set a Labrynth Spell/Trap directly from hand or Deck and it adds itself back when a monster leaves the field by your Normal Trap. It is also a Level 3 Fiend which pairs up nicely with your Lady of Laments. 2 <strong>Tour Guide from the Underworld</strong>. This card is basically a 1 card <strong>UDF</strong> if you don't have access to your Lady of Lament lines or Labrynth lines. 3 <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong>. This card sets Normal Traps from your Deck. 1 <strong>Loris, Lady of Lament</strong>. The only effect you are using is her effect to set a Normal Trap from GY if a monster is tributed or if your Normal Trap is sent to GY by an effect. You really only want to Summon <strong>Loris</strong> by<strong> Ties of the Brethren</strong>, so we are only playing 1. 3 <strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong>. This card can banish a Trap from hand or GY to Summon itself from hand and it can basically search another Lady of Lament when it is tributed. Finally, 1 <strong>Sangan</strong> for tribute fodder. <strong>Malice, Lady of Lament</strong>'s effect is too costly for a small benefit, so we aren't playing her.</span>  <span>3 <strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong>. This card sets up your entire Lady of Lament line. Any Level 3 DARK Fiend gives access to <strong>Lilith</strong> and another Lady of Lament or even<strong> Sangan</strong> for tribute fodder for <strong>Lilith</strong>. This gives <strong>Lilith</strong> basically 2 searches for a Trap to set as she is a Quick Effect, so you can do it once on your turn and again on your opponent's turn. 2 <strong>Labrynth Labyrinth</strong> as it allows you to Special a Fiend from hand or GY if you activate a non-Labrynth Normal Trap. Also, it gives <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> an additional pop with its effect. 1 <strong>Ghostrick Mansion</strong> as a secondary search off of <strong>Ghostrick Alucard</strong> as you are mainly searching <strong>Ghostrick Shot</strong> for an easy <strong>UDF</strong>. 3 <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, 2 <strong>Different Dimension Ground</strong>, 2 <strong>Dimensional Barrier</strong>, 2 <strong>Compulsory Evacuation Device</strong>, 3<strong> Torrential Tribute</strong>, and 3 <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong>. <strong>Welcome Labrynth</strong> can Special a Labrynth monster from Deck and it can reset itself when a monster leaves the field by a Normal Trap effect.</span>  <span>Extra Deck is 3 <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>, 1 <strong>Fossil Warrior Skull Knight</strong>, and 1<strong> Wind Pegasus @ignister</strong> as <strong>Punishment</strong> targets and <strong>Artemate Slay</strong> targets. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus - Sky Thunder</strong>. 2 <strong>Ghostrick Angel of Mischief</strong> and 2 <strong>Ghostrick Alucard</strong> for <strong>UDF</strong> set-ups. 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</strong> and 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future</strong>. 1 <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, 1<strong> Knightmare Phoenix</strong>, and 1 <strong>Dharc the Dark Charmer, Umbral</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck isn't that special. 3 <strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong>, 3 <strong>Raigeki</strong>, and 3 <strong>Artemate Slay</strong>. If you are going second, you want as much removal as possible as this isn't the usual set 5 pass Deck. 2 <strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong>, 2 <strong>Archfiend Glitch</strong>, and 2 <strong>Sundered from Overroot</strong>. <strong>Sundered from Overroot</strong> is interesting as it is non-destruction removal which can also stop your opponent's plays</span>"
