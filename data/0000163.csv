This is a going second deck primarily. It has tools to help going first but it's best going second.

Your main win condition here is obviously Gren Maju Da Eiza for the OTK. Easiest possible way is using Eater of Millions to banish your extra deck giving Gren Maju 6000 ATK on its own.

Gizmek helps with this while providing an annoying board presence even on your opponent's turn. It also is your target for the effects of Armageddon Knight and Dark Grepher unless you have Dimensional Fissure or Macro Cosmos active in which case their target becomes Necroface or in a pinch Snipe Hunter.

Speaking of, Snipe Hunter is there to hopefully draw out your opponent's counter plays. However if he doesn't (and in some cases won't because your opponent is waiting for a more powerful effect to negate) you can do some pretty effective damage to their board while also using the Dangers to mess with them. Keep in mind Dangers still work if banished when discarded.

Speaking of the Dangers, this deck includes a Level 8 XYZ package as a potential backup. This just helps with consistency but also can help with taking out pieces of your opponent's board especially if you have a Gren Maju and/or Eater in your hand that you'd rather not have negated.

This deck is definitely rogue and definitely anti-meta. It will brick occasionally and it will get beat by efficient combos and if you really don't care about that you will love it. Personally I just adore this deck because opponents will rarely if ever be prepared for it unless they're running a broken combo like Avian in which case you'd be in trouble no matter what."

what i mean by that is that tell me what to fix in chat, the people in chat will help make the deck. but if you tell me what card to add, or cut. give me a reason so that i dont cut/add something for no reason.

&nbsp;

I am still fairly new to the game and play online so i dont do any of those budget decks since the stuff online is free for me.

&nbsp;

So if ive made a stupid mistake let me know, for example i have no idea what master rule 5 is.

&nbsp;

And yeah lets make this deck good so people on this website can see a good deck. instead of those decks that are illegal or are just plain garbage."

Despite the ominous introduction, I haven't changed much in my strategy from before. The only thing that improved from last week was the offensive part (every tribute got its well-deserved retirement and non-tribute powerhouses like Jirai Gumo, Seven-Colored Fish und Ryu-Kishin Powered entered the fray) in conjunction with a few nice control tools in Paralyzing Potion and the Clowns.

The biggest impact had the staples: I won't pretend that dual Dark Hole + dual Mirror Force didn't carry the heck out of me. I unfortunately didn't get Imperial Order, Magician of Faith or Solemn Judgment; the first pretty much is universally owned by everyone except me!

But yeah, I managed. I successfully defended the crown against my friends.

The concept of the deck is the same as the last: Sit on 2k defenders, summon your tribute guy and dominate. Sanga of the Thunder und Suijin replaced my old tribute payoffs and definitely pulled their weight.

The other big portion of the deck was, again, Yami. This time, the boost was much more significant than before: Mystical Elf, her cuter sister and Aqua Madoor could survive any encounter with Jirai Gumo under Yami. Ryu-Kishin Powered could at least trade with the strongest beater without any drawbacks, Seven-Colored Fish. Crass Clown could also stand its own against former non-tribute stars Uraby and Skull Red bird, but that barely ever came up.

The other monsters were mostly just filler that made sense given the feel of the deck: Giant Soldier of Stone and Prevent Rat are just solid normals since 2k defenders are the heart and soul of this deck.  Pulling thre Prevent Rat also allowed me to kick Spirit of the Harp in the site who had negative synergy with Yami.

Hane-Hane still punishes opposing tribute payoffs and equip-heavy setups.

The clowns were decent with protection (Paralyzing Potion or Swords) but were kind of meh in this stage of the game. Dream Clown nicely punished walling up, though, and occasionally forced stronger 2k defenders like Giant Soldier of Stone and Aqua Madoor into attack!

Masked Sorcerer is sort of a win more card and intended as such. I lack any form of search or draw power since I didn't pull any of the big searchers or Pot of Greed, so I looked for a way to get through my deck faster. It made good situations better and snowballed somewhat easier with Stim-Pack, but nothing more.

Stop Defense, Fissure, Dark Hole and Tribute to the Doomed are all meant to keep opposing field building in check and disrupt potential counter-walling up. Block Attack served a similar purpose as the ""reverse walls"" of Dark Elf and Jirai Gumo have poor Def.

The secret stars were the equips, however. Paralyzing Potion nicely vegetablized any threatening monster on the opposing end and slowed the game down enough for me to either build up advantage or remove the card with the clowns. Stim-Pack was amazing: It provided huge momentum swings and turned any of my decent attacking monsters into virtual powerhouses. The drawback only hurt me once. Usually, your monsters won't sit around so long to make the attack loss actually noticeable. And if you do, you're usually in a stalemate situation already. Thankfully, most of my friends missed this amazing card!

Mirror Force is just Mirror Force and really enabled the clowns. You could nicely dismantle set cards with a position change and be protected by the holy barrier against offensive threats.

The Extra is just filler cards, ranked according to looks.

The side is, for the most part, filler stuff. Sword &amp; Shield seemed cool as a finisher on paper but I ultimately never used it. Plain walling up was usually more beneficial than a big offensive push.

Tremendous Fire was doing too little for field presence to ever warrant a main slot.

Time Wizard was supposed to serve as a third, riskier Dark Hole. Sided it in once but never used the effect.

Two-Pronged is still a decent tribute spot removal but thanks to my generally better tools available now, I never really bothered with it.

Remove Trap was pretty much dead since there are no permanent traps to speak of where it would work. Imperial Order as the only notable one for my deck negates it &gt;.&lt;

Mask of Darkness was supposed to recycle Mirror Forces. Never put it in once, though. I valued my other control tools too much to justify a wonky two-card combo in an already somewhat inconsistent deck."

Sorry for my long 6 month hiatus. College, the pandemic, and things in my personal life forced me to take a break from the game for a long while. This list is an updated version of my Bujin Tri-Brigade list from October 2020. In 6 months, a whole LOT has changed!


</strong>The first thing that inspired me to recreate this list is the fact that Bujin will be receiving some new support in the next set. I was taken aback by Konami's decision to breathe life back into a dead strategy, but I'm not complaining. Here's a brief summary of the new cards!

<span>Bujin Torfiune:

</span>Fun fact: This is the only Bujin Main Deck monster that is based on another Monster card rather than a character from GX.

Anyway, you can Tribute this guy toSpecial Summon 2 Bujin monsters with different Types from your deck and when you Xyz Summon a Bujin Xyz Monster while Torifune is in the GY, you can equip him to the Xyz Monster which makes it banish anything it destroys by battle. This makes Susanowo finally worth going into and promotes a more aggressive strategy with the archetype rather than a control strategy.

<span>Bujin Mahitotsu

</span>YUGI BOY! (sorry) This guy can be Special Summoned by discarding another Bujin monster (great for getting Bujingi monsters out of your hand.) You then have two effects you can chose from; you can either send a Bujin monster from your hand to add another from your deck or banish a Bujin monster to send a Bujin monster from your deck. This is vulnerable to Ash but you can still get rid of Bujin monsters you don't want in your hand and in this deck you can set up Tri-Brigade Revolt by banishing Bujin monsters.

<span>Bujintersection

</span>Sadly, this is not an archetype exclusive Kaiser Colloseum. Instead, it protects your Bujins from being destroyed by card effects (except in the Battle Phase.) You can also send a Bujin from your field to the yard to negate the effect of a face-up card, and you can destroy Bujintersection during the End Phase to Special Summon any Bujin monster you want from your Graveyard.


The rest of the deck is a fairly standard affair, just do Tribrigade plays and make Bujin Xyz Monsters.

<ul>
 	<li>Combo Starters:
1 - Any Blackwing: They can Special Summon themselves, summon Wise Strix and start combo.
PS: Hand full of spells/ Only 1 Summonable card = Brick.</li>
 	<li>Basic Combos:
<span>1 - Any 2 Blackwings monsters: Special both of them -&gt; Link Summon Wise Strix -&gt; Use effect to summon Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite from your deck -&gt; Link Summon The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche -&gt; Use effect to mill The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots from your deck, set The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine(If you have no traps in your GY) or Phantom Knights' Fog Blade(If you have traps in GY) -&gt; Use the effect of Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite in your GY; return The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche -&gt; Activate The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine(since you have no traps in your gy) -&gt; Xyz Summon using Zephyros and the Trap(The Xyz can be your choice, I normally summon dweller).</span>
<span>2 - 3  monsters or more that can be Summoned(Including 2 Harmattan the Dust or 1 Lv4 Blackwing): NS first Blackwing -&gt; Special Summon other 2 cards(If you have 2 Harmattan the Dust, NS first copy, then add the level to the second, so you have a Lv4 Monster) -&gt; Link Summon Wise Strix, leaving at least 1 Lv4 card in the field -&gt; Activate Wise Strix effect, Special Summon Zephros the Elite -&gt; Xyz Summon into Raidraptor - Force Strix -&gt; Activate Force Strix effect, detach Zephros the Elite, add Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius or Raider's Wing -&gt; Activate Wise Strix effect, set Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force from your Deck -&gt;</span> <span>If you added Raider's Wing: Use it's effect; detach from Force Strix, Special Summon it -&gt; Link Summon into Bardiche, using Xyz and Link -&gt; Activate Bardiche's effect, mill Silent Boots; Set Shade Brigantine from your Deck -&gt; Activate Shade Brigantine -&gt; Xyz Summon using Raider's Wind and Shade Brigantine(Your choice) -&gt; Activate Soul Shave Force -&gt; Rank-Up Force Strix into Cyber Dragon Infinity <span><span><span>-&gt;</span> </span><span>If you added Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius: Link Summon Bardiche using Xyz and Link -&gt; Activate Soul Shave Force -&gt; Rank-Up Force Strix into Cyber Dragon Infinity -&gt; Activate Bardiche's effect, mill Silent Boots; set Shade Brigantine -&gt; Activate Strange Lanius from your hand -&gt; Xyz Summon using Strange Lanius and Shade Brigantine(Your choice, but only DARK monsters can be summoned now).</span></span>
</span></li>
 	<li>Cons:
1 - Any handtrap: At the start of the combo, if your opponent negates Wise Strix, you're dead... There is nothing you can do, unless you have other monsters, to link into Bardiche.
2 - Not a comeback: Same case as number 1, this is a total non-meta combo... Any negate can break this easily.
3 - Tag Duels: You can play it if you're 1st, otherwise there is nothing you can do... If you're 3rd/4th there is probably negates, which you can't handle and if your partner doesn't have a counter for it... You're both dead.</li>
 	<li>Pros:
1 - Versatibility: You can probably combo more than I've shown and I didn't say anything about Simoon the Poison Wind as a combo starter. I've only shown the basic so you can continue it.
2 - Bricks: There is a lot of monsters on it, many of them can Special itself from the hand. It's very hard to brick with this deck. And you can even Pot of Disparity the Synchros, if needed.</li>
 	<li>Side:
I haven't put anything on side, because I'm bad at the Side Deck. This deck probably can't use Handtraps, because it would probably be a brick, unless you start using Deskbots/Mecha Phantom, but that is too much for a deck.</li>
</ul>
Good luck at using this deck and thanks for clicking on this page."

<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">This is the Case of Naturia Antjaw</span>

<span>Naturia Antjaw a card that has no restriction, not even limitation since it does not even have an effect once per turn.
<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">Naturia Antjaw Effect: (<span>Each time the opponent makes a special summon, special summon any naturia level 3 or lower from the deck.) (up to the same Antjaw)</span>
</span></span>
<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">It has good targets like:</span>
<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">Naturia Sunflower (Negate activation of monster effects).

Naturia Rosewhip (Limits opponent to only use one s/t per turn).</span>
<span>Naturia Stinkbug (Protect all your naturia monsters from the Battle phase).</span>

<span>Naturia Marron (It's the draw engine of the deck)</span>
<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">All this plus powerful ""generic"" cards allows us to have a ""fairly consistent"" deck since a simple foolish burial gods allows us to play.</span>
<span>This deck have quite a few starters like: </span>

<span>Foolish burial Gods (send Naturia sacred tree from the deck to the gy to search antjaw from the deck to the hand. (Basically one card combo)</span>

<span>Magician's Souls:(<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">It allows the deck to reach Antjaw without even using the normal summon.)
You send Palladium Oracle Mana as a cost to summon Magician's Souls .
You can send up to 2 Naturia sacred tree from your hand to the gy with magician's souls which becomes a +2 (send 2 to draw 2 and search 2).
</span><span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">It also allows us to protect Antjaw by battle since with him we can make linkuriboh, so the opponent cannot make normal summon pass battle phase and destroy antjaw to play during the MP2.</span></span>

Level 6 monsters and the new retort fusion: Basically Beatrice Lady of the eternal is to search Antjaw and Marron quickly.

&nbsp;
<span class=""Y2IQFc"" lang=""en"">This deck has the same broken extenders as Antjaw like:</span>
<span>Worm bait: 2 free tokens for link and synchro plays.

Hop Ear Squadron: Make Herald of the arc light during the opponent turn.</span>

(besides pendulum, but i don't think that really counts for much)","I tried my best to get as many summoning possibilities with this deck. With this deck, your main goal is to get dragoon out, or to find ways to use other monsters you have to attack over your opponent. I find using this deck really enjoyable, and I hope you will too.

with the correct hand you can have a fusion, synchro, xyz, and link on the field on your first turn, with paladin in the graveyard. ( Red-eyes, Black stone of legend, Unknown synchron, Pre-prep, Noctovision [if going first for the extra draw], and monster reborn.)

If you have any ideas on how to change this deck for the better, go ahead and tell me!

Have a good one!"

Most of the <strong>Stigmatika</strong> cards in LIOV do not work that well with the <strong>Stigmatika</strong>/<strong>Despia</strong> support in DAMA especially since the <strong>Despia</strong> are Fairies and not dragons and they are also not Light Attribute. <strong>Hecatrice</strong> and <strong>Vahalla</strong> ar my interpretation of how to get to a Light monster easier, but the baby chaos dragons along with <strong>Chaos Space</strong> might work better if you want to utilize<strong> Stigmatika of White</strong>.

3 <strong>Ash</strong>, 3 <strong>Albus</strong>, 3 <strong>Hecatrice</strong> are your non-<strong>Despia</strong> mons. <strong>Dramaturgia</strong> of<strong> Despia</strong> is a very lackluster negate, but it summons itself if its banished from FIELD or HAND by something like<strong> Albion</strong> which makes it only a one-of. <strong>Albert</strong> is your most important Normal/Special Summon aside from <strong>Albus</strong> as he searches a <strong>Stigmatika</strong> Spell/Trap which will often be <strong>Theatre</strong> as it has a fusion effect that isn't limited to using a dragon monster as one of the materials. <strong>Despian of Tragedy</strong> is probably your best form of consistency as it searches a<strong> Despia</strong> upon being banished or sent for a fusion or other effect. Its second effect gets you back <strong>Curtain Rise</strong> but ""only 1 effect per turn, and only once that turn."" <strong>Despian of Comedy</strong> is aight but you should probably side it if you believe in there being targeting effects when the game is more about negates.

3 <strong>Valhalla</strong>. 3 <strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> for<strong> Albus</strong>. 3 <strong>Despia</strong>, <strong>Stigmatika Theatre</strong> whose fusion eff doesnt 't restrict you to using a dragon as material. 3 <strong>Stigmatika Curtain Rise</strong> which is bonkers as it either searches, summons from deck, and it protects against board wipes. 1 <strong>Stigmatika of White</strong> since <strong>Despia</strong> are Faries. 3 <strong>Prosperity</strong>. 3 <strong>Retort Fusion</strong> which is ironic due to<strong> Instant Fusion</strong>. 3 <strong>Super Poly</strong>. 1 <strong>Dogmatika Encounter</strong> which gives you access to <strong>Albus</strong> I guess.

ED: 1 <strong>The First Darklord</strong> which is a<strong> Punishment</strong> target and it gets you a Fairy every turn. 1 <strong>Dracrown of Mysterion</strong> which is just funny I guess since I have like a seizure trying to understand its effect with my ape brain. 1 <strong>Despian Proscenium</strong> which is like <strong>Goyo Emperor</strong> (?) and <strong>Evil HERO Inferno Wing</strong> (?). 2 <strong>Despain Quaeritis</strong> which is the easiest fusion to summon, otk potential, it floats into <strong>Albus</strong>. 2 <strong>Albion</strong> which is one of my favourite cards since it has so much versatility. 2 <strong>Titaniklad</strong> which is here for the atk gain and EP <strong>Albus</strong> search. 1 <strong>Brigand</strong> which is an <strong>Albus</strong>/<strong>Albion</strong> target. <strong>Starving Venom</strong> for <strong>Super Poly</strong>. 2 <strong>Musician King</strong> as a Light off of <strong>Retort Fusion</strong>. 2 <strong>N'tss</strong> to send off of <strong>Punishment</strong>.

Side Deck is nothing special. <strong>Phantazmay</strong> is bonkers if you know you are going against a link deck since its a Dark, its a Dragon, and it gets you cards which is much needed in this deck. The rest are just traps you would use going first."

So this is a deck focused on using the typing of the gimmick puppet monsters to add extenders in the Orcust strategy. Most, if not all, gimmick puppet monsters are bricks. Therefore to increase the effectiveness of the deck we are playing the only two good gimmick puppet monsters (dreary and bisque) as they are able to special from graveyard and hand respectively. Utilizing the  scrap combo, orcust's foolish burial ability's, the rank 8 toolbox of gimmick, and a hint of cheese (machine dup can be used on knightmare). You too can push out ding, an orcust link, Avermax, and a gimmick puppet xyz in your first turn or not."

Here is a semi playable budget control version! Similar to the budget trap shaddol build. The idea is to control the board and use dogmatika punishment to send the worse extra monsters and then use those to miracle fusion. One idea is to send the masked fire hero and any other masked hero to make contrast off of a miracle fusion. Two miracle fusions and two sunrisers for that point as well. Try it out online and it is a very cheap build if you love heros but do not have the money for the expensive builds.

I call it semi-budget because you do need the 1 Archosaur at least. Pretty consistent going 2nd deck and also has the ability to pop off going first. I managed to win even with getting Lancea'd several times and getting Misc negated a few times. Would be more consistent with Pot of Prosperity or Extravagance. Some notes about the choices I made:
<ol>
 	<li>The kaiju is nice to have. Even though he has high attack, it's great for outing Dragoon and other problem cards, and is also of course searchable with Oviraptor</li>
 	<li>I put some backrow removal in the main deck simply because people play traps at my local</li>
 	<li>Drawing into Archosaur isn't the end of the world as long as you have another Dino and/or Fossil Dig. Fossil Dig lets you search Baby, then you normal Archosaur, pop Baby, use Baby to summon Oviraptor, and go from there</li>
 	<li>Played 3 Baby and 2 Petit to boost consistency since I don't have the Pots. I always sided out 1 Petit after the first game</li>
 	<li>Pankratops is amazing and helps you out Winda, among other monsters</li>
 	<li>If you draw Dark Ruler going second, you basically win</li>

I'm aware Evolzar Dolkka and Animadorned Archosaur are extremely useful in this deck, but I haven't either. Plus,","With the banning of True King of All Calamities, the boss of this deck has shifted to Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, though it isn't the only way to win. For pesky cards difficult to get rid of, such as Red Eyes Dark Dragoon, Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju, can easily take it's place and get flipped face down with UCT's ability. Gizmek Kaku is useful against opponents' big Link monsters, such as an opposing Borrelsword Dragon, so long as it remains in the Extra Deck Zone. With all the banishing done for UCT and Miscellaneousaurus, summoning Overtex Qoatlu and bolstering Tyranno Infinity's attack should be a cakewalk. Plus, with the pairing of Overtex Qoaltus and Lost World, you can easily pop off Babycerasaurus's and Petiterandon's effects from the deck. True King Lithosagym is great for preventing any possiblilty of annoying Extra Deck monsters, such as Dragoon. True King Agnimazud effortlessly gets around the effects that prevent card destruction, as it banishes.

In regards to the extra deck, Evolzar Laggia is great for stopping the activation of card effects or summoning of monsters. Additionally, after his effect pops off, summoning an Ultimate Conductor Tyranno should be simple as pie (or is it pi? I honestly haven't a clue). Dark Rebellion and Dark Requiem both do essentially the same thing, though Requiem's effect is much more potent and cheaper to activate. Knightmare Phoenix is useful as spell destruction and sending dinosaur monsters to the grave for an UCT. Borrelsword Dragon is useful to pair up with UCT since it can change a monster to defense position on either players' turns. Martial Metal Marcher, Goyo Guardian, Infernity Doom Archfiend, and Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu are mainly there to help get out Crystal Wing and Clear Wing, though they are useful in other ways. Jiujiu will almost always be protected by its own effect in this deck as monsters are frequently hitting the grave. Its additional effect also serves to bolster Tyranno Infinity and/or summon Overtex Qoaltus. It's easy to clear your hand with this deck, allowing Infernity Doom Archfiend's effects to have full potency. Finally, Goyo Guardian serves to prevent some cards from hitting the opponent's graveyard if they rely on it while bolstering your own defenses."

This deck can make archlord Kristya fairly easily as a broken floodgate to lock out your opponent. At first I was playing <a data-name=""herald of perfection"">herald of perfection</a>, but I realized that you need exact levels for that card, so I switched to <a data-name=""Herald of Ultimatness"">Herald of Ultimatness</a> instead, seeing as this deck can bring it out just as easily. I think the new fairy support that just got revealed would be a decent extender for the deck, but I don't know if it's in the deck builder yet. I upped the count of the field spell to two, because three still seems like too much, but two seems to be fine. I also added levianeer to the list as a strong extender that can also serve to rip a card from my opponent's hand."

Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon - allows for 1 omni-negate and is simply a boss monster

Buster Dragon - turns all monsters on the field into dragons

Buster Blader - states that dragon monsters in your opponents possession are switched to defence position and cannot activate their effects

Dragon Buster Destruction Sword - locks opponent out of the extra deck

Other than back row, this pretty much locks your opponent out from playing Yugioh.

Alternatively you could end with Borreload Savage + Buster Blader + Buster Dragon

Go easly for OTK combo and overkill your opponent or Summon Big Boys Numeronius Monsters C1000 / iC1000 with 100000 att,"Hello guys,

Here is the new version of Numeron deck that I built. I've worked a lot on this deck and I succeed to defeat a lot of meta decks with this deck. I hope you will enjoy it.

With this deck, you have 92% to draw Numeron Network on your first turn if you start second and 86% if you play first.

There is two possibilities with this deck :

<span><strong><u>I/ Going for OTK combo</u></strong></span>

I've played a lot Numeron decks and I know that most of the time we quickly win by OTK our opponent during our first turns by summon all Numeron monsters and attacking with them (first one : 1000 attack -&gt; 2000 attack -&gt; 4000 attack -&gt; 8000 attack !)... In order to do that, I added these cards on this deck :
<ul>
 	<li>Against monsters :
<ul>
 	<li><a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> : just wow with Numeron decks, because it doesn't target, it can negate multiple monsters effects and your opponent cannot respond to its effect. This card can also negate ""surprise"" monster effects during the battle phase, which is very welcome.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> : amazing card, especially for Numeron decks</li>
 	<li>And the final one... <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>... Which is just the most AMAZING card for Numeron decks. You can tribute two monsters on the opponent side to summon this card on your opponent side. This card is just perfect against most of ""full board ultimate 7 negates...."". Also I added Dark Spirit's Mastery in order to search this card. Because after a lot of games, I realized how good is this card with Numeron decks and most of the time, I win by the help of this card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Against ""Full trap board trololo go fu*** yourself"", I added:
<ul>
 	<li>You can use <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, which can also be used against monsters</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Red reboot"">Red reboot</a> : this card is done for OTK decks. So it's just a mandatory to have this card on Numeron decks.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a></li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Hey, Trunade"">Hey, Trunade</a> : I discovered this card recently... And wow, it's a greater ""Red reboot"" which is not limited. Hey hey !! Perfect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span><strong><u>II/ Summoning the Big Numeronius Boys</u></strong></span>

The alternative is to try to summon Numeronius cards : <a data-name=""Number C1000: Numeronius"">Number C1000: Numeronius</a> or <a data-name=""Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia"">Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia</a>. This combo is not recommanded if you want to play safe and just win... But against bad players, you can have a lot of fun playing this combo.

You have Unchained monsters to do that.

The combo in order to do that :
<ol>
 	<li>You need in your hand : 1 or 2 <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a> (92% to draw 1 Numeron Network on your first turn) and one Unchained monster.
<ol>
 	<li>If you just have 1 <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a>, you will need to have another one on your next turn in order to do this combo... Which is not very recommanded because you just count on the luck.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Summon the four Numeron monsters</li>
 	<li>Summon <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a>. Which will banish all monsters on the field</li>
 	<li>Protect yourself by using <a data-name=""One Day of Peace"">One Day of Peace</a> or an Unchained monster in defense mode or <a data-name=""Numeron Wall"">Numeron Wall</a></li>
 	<li>End your turn</li>
 	<li>If you survived and you still have <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a> on your field, summon <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a> which was banished</li>
 	<li>Then use an Unchained monster from your hand to destroy your <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a></li>
 	<li>Use :
<ol>
 	<li>The effect of <a data-name=""Numeron Network"">Numeron Network</a> to use the effect of <a data-name=""Numeron Chaos Ritual"">Numeron Chaos Ritual</a> from your deck</li>
 	<li>Or use directly the effect of <a data-name=""Numeron Chaos Ritual"">Numeron Chaos Ritual</a> from your hand, if this card is in your hand.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
 	<li>If you play first: go direcly to <a data-name=""Infinitrack Fortress MegaClops"">Infinitrack Fortress MegaClops</a> to protect yourself. After that, you can use Forbidden Droplet on Megaclops to destroy it and in order to have the possibility to summon your Numeron monsters. You can also replace MegaClops by <a data-name=""Mekk-knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-knight Crusadia Avramax</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Apollousa, bow of the goddess"">Apollousa, bow of the goddess</a></li>
 	<li>If you play against ""trololo you can't attack me because I'm a Exodia Player with a lot of cards to prevent attacks"", go to Burn effect with <a data-name=""Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya"">Number C1 Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya</a>.</li>

(4 years of exp),"The idea is to banish everything. two cards in the deck does that, Macro Cosmos and Dimensional Fissure. I know there is only 2 cards that banishes everything but trust me you will see them more often than you see your mama. If you keep banishing everything than you will make your opponent suffer and you will make your field. Btw fun-fact: Macro Cosmos is ash proof so don't be scared to activate it. One mistake I see players does is summoning Zeroboros early in the game. DON'T. It's a late game card ya dinguss. Imagine having a 10k atk beat-stick and a 3k wheenie.

So obviously this deck is a Anti-Meta and Non-Meta deck. Metaphys Deadalus if used right will deal with every single meta deck and you will see you won your opponent surrendered message on the screen a lot. Becouse they start crying when they see all of their monsters get banishd and they can't even activate anything to respond that banish. L. (Deadalus + Field Spell Combo)

If you live tru the 3rd round your chances of winning is quite high. IF YOU DONT MESS UP."

So when comparing the previous builds of the deck from my old account: Kyo Saisto and making adjustments to the deck to suit its playstyle, I am currently running a Zombie world engine with Doomking Balderoch and having it combo with Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi can make the two become a threat on the field with 3 negates and a way of banishing a card from either the field or GY. I am also making use of the Shiranui support line with cards such as Shiranui Squire and Shiranui SpectralSword Shade to then go into Shiranui Squiresaga and then further extend with the spell card Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi Manuscript to further synchro summon into Shiranui Sunsaga which then can help wiping the board whilst at the same time recycling your extra deck. As per usual when playing Mayakashi, it is important to climb from level 3 to level 11 with the use of Hajun when summoned can speacial summon out another Mayakashi monster such as Dakki to start the synchro climb and cards like Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi can act as a foolish burial of the deck as it allows you to dump a zombie monster to the GY such as Necroworld Banshee, Glow-up Bloom and Mezuki are key cards that can help setup for more GY plays. For handtraps I've managed to add cards like Ash Blossom &amp; Ghost Ogre to help put a stop to my opponents plays.

&nbsp;

For the side deck, I have Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion reserved, Ghost Reaper for a generic level 3 Tuner, Another copy of Burial from a different Dimension for being able to recycle cards such as Mezuki back into the graveyard, one copy of book of life as well as a copy of Fateful Hour to act as monster reborns and lastly Magic cylinder and I know not many people these days don't really play this card in their deck but its pretty useful for a rather more defensive play.

&nbsp;

Feel free to leave some of your feedbacks about the deck down below and I would love to hear your guys advice on how I can improve the deck as one day I would love to play in my first locals/event."

I have managed to beat some meta decks with this because they did not see Gravity Bind coming LOL. I dont think it's the best trap to run though, but we are very happy with this deck!

<span>Going first, the deck can be fragile to hand-traps not unless you have a good amount of extenders to continue the combo. One of the most underrated extenders is Block Golem as its effect to tribute itself and special summon any 2 rock monsters level 4 or lower, it has definitely given me so much success since playing it. Just be mindful at what kind of attributes are in the GY as long as they're all earth. Block Golem can use its effect multiple times being that its effect is a soft once per turn.   </span>

<span><span>also the only hand-trap is Nibiru  because it synergizes naturally, since the deck is more about lucky excavations its combos can take many routes to end on strong boards like the above^ example.</span> </span>"

I dont like to run 3 Red-eyes Insight because it makes the games a bit too same-y, it's an incredible card though!

What cool stuff does this deck do?
1) Can put a Red-Eyes Black Dragon sword on a Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon  t1! That's a massive creature that resurrects normal monsters, cant be killed by effects, and pings you enemy for 500 whenever they do anything!
2) Red-Eyes Fusion out a Meteor Black Comet Dragon or Slash Dragon
3)Suicide Alternative Dragons to bring back to life Red-Eyes Black Dragon's with 4800 Attack!
4) Mirror Force

When I built this a lot of the cards where dirt cheap, I paid 25 cents each for my alternative dragons, and like a buck for the Return of the Dragon lords...It's a shame that this deck has gotten spendy.

I dont like the Red-eyes resurrection traps, I think they are very bad for red-eyes. Monster reborn and Return of Dragonlords lets you resurrect things the turn you need it, and extends your plays greatly. And Return of the Dragonlord's GY effect is insane, especially in a deck that likes to go HUGE with Red-Eyes black dragon sword. The Red-eyes resurrections are more bricks then help

We spent a long time getting this deck to a strong but casual power level we think makes yugioh awesome. As a rule of thumb, we don't like to run Hand Traps like Impermanence/Ash and counter monsters(Like Dragoon, Harbinger, toadally awesome, ect ect) as it allows one to create truly unbeatable boards t1 or set up 1hitKills, and that's just unfun IMO.

Why no Dragoon? I tried running a proxy Dragoon against Stephnie once, and I summoned it, killed both of her Blue eyes White dragons, dealt 6k to her with her own destroyed monsters, and just attacked for game because he couldn't even be hit by her traps. It's a very unfun card that only should be used vrs the meta IMO.

If you have friends that play casual, I cant recommend this deck enough, it's fun and INCREDIBLY consistent!"

I've always played Gladiator Beasts and this is my take on them, obviously with a lot of looking around for ideas. Any suggestions are welcomed. I call this deck Gladiator Beast Rejection not because of Gladiator Rejection, but because my focus is to get the big monsters to negate effects, spells, and traps.

 	<li>If <a data-name=""Unexpected Dai"">Unexpected Dai</a>, then special summon <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast Andal</a> first</li>

</li>
 	<li>Summon <a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a> and active her effect hoping not to get <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></li>

 	<li>Use one to get <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> and summon the third <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast </a>Andal from your hand</li>
 	<li>Go to <a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a> with <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> and <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Andal"">Gladiator Beast </a>Andal, get <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast's Comeback"">Gladiator Beast's Comeback</a> if you don't have it in your hand, otherwise <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Noxious"">Gladiator Beast Noxious</a> or <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a> or <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a> (to make her level 5+)</li>
 	<li>Activate the effect of <a data-name=""Test Panther"">Test Panther</a> and get <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a> instead of Gladiator Beast Andal, special summon <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Noxious"">Gladiator Beast Noxious</a>/<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Vespasius"">Gladiator Beast Vespasius</a>/<a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attorix"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>

It  has a really cool goth aesthethic and i'm very m e n t a l l y i l l rn (more so than normal) so im fucking vibin with this archetype. Anyway here's a deck guide because I like these. This will prob be really obselete soon when more cards get revealed but whatever it's fucking cool. Tips appreciated because idk what i'm d- GOD DAMMIT EPSTIEN, I FUCKING TOLD YOU TH ERULES. YOU STAY IN THE GOD DAMN BASEMENT WHEN GUESTS ARE OVER

3x Tragedy- Tragedy is a great card, as it's basically a ROTA for the archetype once it's sent to the grave. This is an archetype designed with ditching cards to the grave in mind, as you can easily pitch it for a fusion, Super Poly cost, etc, meaning it's ROTA effect will go off easily and get your plays starting. ONce in the grave, it can be banished to recur a archetypal S/T back to the board, which is really nice for recovering lost cards on turn 2 to continue plays or manipulating the board state. You can only use one of these effects and once per turn, but it's still powerful. (all of the level 4 or lower Despian's have this hard once per turn, one effect per turn restriction so im only goingt o mention it here for the sake of simplictiy)
3x Comedy- Looking like me after a serious dip in my  mental health, Comedy is a pretty solid card for the deck for protection. It discards itself when a archetypal card you control is targeted for an effect, avoiding various meta cards like Drident. If Comedy is in the grave, it can tribute a fusion to summon itself. It can get fusions in the grave for effects and get bodies on the board, which is nice, but this effect is a bit situational.
3x Albert- God, why did they fucking name it Albert? That sounds so stupid. Anyway, Albert is a solid card, as on summon, it fetches an archetypal S/T. This is really nice, as the archetype uses a lot of S/T and can use the S/T to field swarm and fuse. And, if a face up fusion leaves the field because of the opponent, Albert can special summon himself and Imperm an opponent's monster. Albert's all around really solid as a searcher and control card, aside from the shitty name.
2x Name I can't spell- With a name I can't spell, this monster is really cool but not a staple 3 of, due to it's high level. I play it at 2 since it's a high level, to avoid bricking. Since the deck can search and special a lot, it can still get this monster out easily with it at 2. Anyway, onto the effect: If a monster from the extra is summoned, it can Imperm a monstrer on the board. This effect is amazing for interrupting combos midway through. Additionally, this has a special summoning condition, as if it's sent to the grave or banished for a fusion, you can bring it back. Generally, solid main deck boss monster that can be a bit bricky. The only main flaws is that it's a bit bricky due to a high level and it has a hard once per turn on the Imperm effect.
3x Fallen of Albaz- My baby boy. I included a Albaz engine, because A) lore B) naming shit with some of the cards C) it can easily fuse into some of the Despia monsters with it's effect. It's effect is basically just a super poly on summon, so as long as you have the field set up, you can use it to go into the Despia fusions and clear the opponent's board. Additonally, he can be used for Stigmata of white.
3x Stigmata of White- Stigmata of White is a fusion spell for Albaz, allowing you to use materials from hand, field, and grave, which is amazing and helps a ton with getting multiple fusion bodies on the board. Additionally, if it was discareded for my baby boy, it can be reset to the board, which is amazing.
3x Theatre- Oh god, no. Not the fucking ABYSS ACTOR FLASHBACKS, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
Jeffery Epstien here. I'll be taking over while Amy is having a breakdown. Now what the hell is a yu gi oh card?
The field spell is the main archetypal fusion card, oddly enough. It allows you to fuse any level 8 or higher fusion, not an archetypal one, making this technically generic. This is great and means this archetype has engine potential. Anyway, it uses materials from hand and field, which is pretty standard. Additionally, if a non-fusion Fairy leaves the board because of the opponent, you can special summon a Fusion from your grave, making it hard for the opponent to clear your board. All around amazing card.
3x Curtain Rise- Curtain Rise is a E-tele for the archetype, allowing you to discard one to special summon a Despia from deck. while yes, this does also add a Despia to hand, you're never going to be searching, just summoning, to be honest. Anyway, the discard cost is surprisingly good in this deck, as it triggers Tragedy, a strong card you want in the grave.  Additionally, if a fusion would be destroyed by a card effect, you can banish Curtain Rise from the grave instead. This is also an amazing effect, making it incredibly hard to kill your boss monsters, as a lot of current strong monsters like Big Tiddy Cow rely on popping.
3x Super Poly- Amy decided to include the Super Poly package in this deck, to take full advantage of the generic summoning conditions of the Albaz fusions and the Despian fusions. This helps a lot with wiping boards going second and controlling the board going first. Additionally, it's discard cost triggers Tragedy, and this alongside cards like Albaz and other fusion cards helps to get tons of bodies on board incredibly fast.
2x Poly- Poly is just here in order to generically fuse into the fusions, in cases where your hand may be more bricky or less useful. Poly can also be searched off of Fusion Recycling Plant, which is quite nice.
2x Fusion Recycling Plant- Plant is a pretty nice searcher, as it adds either Poly if you have a clogged up hand, or maybe Super (I am unsure of the rulings of that). Additionally, during the end phase, Recycling Plant can bounce back a used up fusion material from grave to hand, setting up turn 2 plays. Neither of these effects are hard once per turns either.
1x Terraforming- Terraforming has two targets, as if you already have Theatre, you can search Plant, and visa versa. Generally, terra is a versatile and useful card for the deck. It's also Ash bait.
1x One for One- One for One is a solid card for getting bodies on board, as Comedy and Tragedy are both level 1's. Due to this, you can use One for One to help swarm the field for plays. Additionally, One for One discards, meaning it can trigger Tragedy.
3x Judgement- Judgement is a solid card for the deck, as if you control a level 8 or higher fusion (which you should since the archetype centers around them), you can pop the opponent's board of monsters weaker than them. Use this when they're weak, or use this in tandem with Qua, and you have a Raigeki on the opponent's turn for no cost. Fucking solid. It also has the same recursion effect as White.
The solemns- I'll just group them together for simplicity. Since this is control focused, I tossed in 3 Strike and 2 Judgement to halt the opponent's plays. LP doesn't  matter very much and these are solid cards. If you can find the space, I reccomend playing Trap Trick to search them out.
3x Proscsenium- The main boss monster, Proscenium is a big boy with 3200 attack. It also has generic fusion materials, only requiring a Despia and a light and a dark. This makes it a great Super Poly target, as Lights and Darks are the two most common attributes in the game. It's main effect is that, during the MP, it can either banish or steal a extra deck monster from the opponent's graveyard. This is absolutely amazing, as it can interrupt plays, and if you manage to out a powerful boss monster, you can steal it for yourself. Additionally, whenever Prosc destroys a monster by battle, it inflicts damage to the opponent equal to whichever stat of the destroyed montser is higher. This guy is an absolute fucking monster, in both art and effect, and I love him. I like how they didn't resort to just giving it a negate to make it good.
3x Qua- First off, Qua also has great materials, as they're generic. Qua only requires a Despia and a light or Dark, the most common attributes in the game, making it an amazing super poly target. Anyway, Qua allows you to change the attack of all face up monsters, except for level 8 or higher fusions (AKA itself), to 0. This allows you to wipe boards using Judgement, and help you beat over problem monsters. Additionally, since this is a quick effect, it can be a surprisingly good interruption against problem decks like Drytron, which use the attack of the Drytrons for a ritual summon. Additionally, if it leaves the field because of the opponent, it allows you to special summon a Despia or Fallen of Albaz from deck, which is also amazing, and sets up turn 2 plays if your opponent manages to break your board.
2x Brigrand- Brigrand is a great Albaz target, as your opponent will most likely have many higher leveled bodies on board, depending on the match up. You can easily summon Brigrand to wipe their board using Fallen of Albaz. Additionally, only Brigrand can be targeted for effects and it can't be destroyed by battle, making it a strong wall to protect your other monsters.
1x Albion- Albion is also generic, only requiring Albaz and a Light monster. Light is the second most popular attribute in the game, so. Anyway, on summon, albion lets you fusion summon a level 8 or lower fusion, by banishing fusion materials from your graveyard, hand, or field. This effect is amazing, and lets you get multiple bodies on board easily just off of on 1 Albaz.
1x Golden Lord- Super Poly go brrrr. Same goes for the rest of the fusions from here on out
Playing the deck is pretty easy. Going first, you normal Albert, search, fuse into huge fuckin monsters, and set a ton of backrow. Then you just beat the shit out of the opponent and move on with your day. I feel this deck has a ton of potential and is generally pretty powerful as a control deck. Have fun."

Although I have most of its cards, <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> is VERY expensive, hence why I don't run it.

Before I explain the strategy, let me tell the history of this deck:
<div>

This is my most stable and powerful deck, however, it's a little old, as the last time I really hunkered down to improve it, there were no Nibiru, Zeus or Dragoons around. Thank COVID for that. And, according do MBT, I can upload my decks in here in order to seek advice, so that's what I'm doing.

Now, I'm an old-school player that skipped ""those wacky black and white cards"", and, just as I was getting used to Pendulums (Igknights best deck, let's GOOOOO), Links dropped and made me completely lost. And since I was buying a lot of cards, and VRAINS is a really cool anime, I tried making a Playmaker deck. The first time I managed to make a Decode Talker on a single turn was soooo exciting...... until it got Kaiju'd.

Then I found about <a data-name=""Cyberse Magician"">Cyberse Magician</a> lock, how Cyberse Clock and Quantum Dragons are able to do that lock similarly, how Transcode and Excode Talkers open up zones for them (back when this was a thing, in MR4) and finally, I got to a point where my deck can consistently setup Transcode and Excode protected by Masquerena on turn 1....... Until I got Nibiru'd. So now my deck is trash again, and I really wanna know how to make it playable again.

</div>
Okay, now for the ACTUAL strategy:

My focus is making a board where most of my monsters are protected, and Excode Talker works wonders for that. The winning formula of this deck consists in having a Transcode Talker on the Extra Monster Zone, pointing to a Excode Talker, that protects it from destruction (and can be revived due to Transcode's effect), plus one of the three locking monsters, either <a data-name=""Cyberse Magician"">Cyberse Magician</a>, <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> on the field, being pointed by the Excode Talker. Any extras are welcome.

If everything works and I end up with a Transcode, Excode and one of the three lockers on the field, the locker protects all monsters from attacks or effects, and Excode protects the locker from effects.

However, one thing I cannot do is NEGATE, and that is why Nibiru works against me. Since Nibiru does not destroy, neither Excode, Masquerena or the Locker are able to prevent it from working. I THINK (not too sure, though) that Kaiju's, Sphere Mode, Lava Golem and the sort does not work due to the locker disallowing targetting, but since Nibiru neither targets nor destroy....

An example of a Combo:

<span class=""tsujoShoukan"">Normal Summon</span> Clock Wyvern, then <span class=""tokushoShoukan"">Activate</span> its effect to halve its ATK and <span class=""tokushoShoukan"">Special Summon</span> a token.

<span class=""tokushoShoukan"">Activate</span> One-Time Passcode to <span class=""tokushoShoukan"">Special Summon</span> ANOTHER token.

I usually assume Code Talkers are better to begin with, but:</td>

<span class=""linkShoukan"">Link Summon</span> <a data-name=""Excode Talker"">Excode Talker</a> using Masquerena and the remaining Token. That protects Excode from destruction effects, and grants another destruction protection to Transcode, since it points to it.

<span class=""yugoShoukan"">Fusion Summon</span> <a data-name=""Cyberse Clock Dragon"">Cyberse Clock Dragon</a>, using Clock Wyvern and Clock Spartoi, in the middle zone, or the outermost zone closest to your used Extra. We COULD use Linkuriboh, but we'll need him for some battle protection...

If everyone survives (which is VERY unlikely), next turn, using only one summon, we can bring both Transcode and Excode Talkers in a way that also protects our Clock Dragon.

However, this uses 11 summons as well.</td>

</table>
As you can see, all scenarios lead to Nibiru. We COULD not Special Summon a few monsters on the beginning of the turn, but that would end at most with a unprotected Transcode Talker.

So, I need advices. What should I run on this deck?"
