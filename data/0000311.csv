Yeah as cool as Rose Dragons are in the Anime they are quite difficult to pilot, so let me explain more in Detail.</p><p>If you decide to play Rose Dragon it's like playing 2 Decks at once, so be prepared and practice:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Rose Dragons</strong></p><p>The Dream Combo is opening Red and White Rose Dragon. Summon Black Rose Dragon ---&gt; Search Frozen Rose ---&gt; Mill Revival Rose ----&gt; Special Roxrose Dragon ---&gt; Search whatever fits the Situation ---&gt; Summon Ruddy Rose Dragon.</p><p>But beware that that's not that strong going first. Going first a Crossrose Dragon +Black Garden or a plant on your field is way better to interrupt plays with a sudden Black Rose Dragon summon during his turn. Again beware to not do it mid chain since BRD (Black Rose Dragon) will miss his timing then.&nbsp;</p><p>Roxrose Dragon, Blue Rose Dragon &amp; Blooming of the Darkest Rose all help to prevent the loss of a Black Rose Dragon when he destroys all Cards. White Rose Dragon, Garden Rose Maiden and Black Garden are able to revive lost Rose Dragons.</p><p>Combining Black Rose Moonlight Dragon with Black Garden allows a Monster Bounce which can't be negated since you can Chainblock the effect with Black Garden itself.</p><p>As for Ruddy Rose Dragon, beware using his banishing effect early since you too will loose a lot of Graveyard effects and possible plants for banishing for other effects. Think of it as a big blowout midgame to finish the game easily then.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a lot more to think about here but that are things you will experience for yourself if you play with this Deck more often.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Plants</strong></p><p>The 2nd essencial focus in this Deck are the plants. Ruddy Rose Witch enables a search for the Witch of the Black Rose and puts a Rose Fairy on top of the Deck which results in another easy way to access Black Rose Dragon and especially Roxrose Dragon but only with no other cards on your side of the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Lonefire Blossom helps to fill the Graveyard with plants for Mark of the Rose, a powerful Snatch Steal like Spell and she can easily summon Tytannial or Gigaplant.</p><p>Tytannial has to be the best going first move possible since she +Black Garden equals almost infinite targeting negates for anywhere on the field. It's very easy to destroy whole Combo setups with her and win the game from there, a real powerhouse to play.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rose Tentacles are another powerplayer with Black Garden together. If you equip her with Thorn of Malice it's very easy to OTK the opponent with very little setup.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly Queen of Thorns makes up for a nice floodgate which is another good going first setup. There's a lot more to think about and many Combos which I can't go into detail here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p><p>This Deck can easily destroy all cards on the field every turn and prevent Combo decks from playing the game with Tytannial. Black Garden cripples many Decks and creates many special gamestates from which you can easily overrun your opponent.</p><p>But sometimes the synergy between the own cards doesn't work out the way you want and bigger towers can be difficult to clear. It's a difficult deck to play optimal.&nbsp;</p><p>If you like Rose Dragons be sure to give this Deck a try. I find it easy to go into Platin League in Master Duel with it. Beyond that it's getting difficult to progress against certain matchups.</p><p>Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆☆</p>"

The deck master allows acess to LIGHT, DARK, and WATER attribute monsters that are good to have. Originally I was going to make this a Gaia and Ursartic deck (don't laugh) as I noticed some Gaia's have effects when tributed but they don't work with the Ursartic's for some reason. I also soon realized that Ursartic's arent very good even if they could activate the Gaia's mediocre tribute effects.</p><p>So I decided to use Branded and the generic fusion support which turned out to be better than my original idea. In this format Verte is legal so he can summon any 1 out of the 3 best boss monsters in the deck which is pretty insane. I am unsure of how this deck will play out, maybe after playtesting it will be edited heavily as it currently has no disruptive backrow to speak of. In anycase this deck will probably be pretty fun which is why I made this in the first place.</p><p>If the domain format interests you here is a link to the discord.</p><p><a>https://discord.gg/jGkRCJkt3d</a></p>"

Standard Windwitch engine to Synchro out Crystal Wing (who can't be destroyed by the opponent's card effects thanks to Snow Bell), OR Diamond Bell, who can destroy cards super easily with Trickstar's needle damage. As a general rule I would SS Crystal Wing if you're going first, and Diamond Bell if you're going second (otherwise Diamond Bell won't have much to destroy). The Droll/Reincarnation combo isn't as meta anymore, and thus can come as a nasty surprise for your opponent if you can pull it off. Obviously we also need interaction to protect our pieces, so I've completed the deck with what I found interesting (and also budget).</p><p>*The Two copies of Metaverse enables the deck to have an incredibly consistent Trickstar Engine despite Terraforming being Limited. Trap Trick, Metaverse, and Terraforming all represent Light Stage (which in turn represents Candina, etc.).</p>"

Absolute penis lists like this.</p><p>The main idea is to be able to set up an I:P Masquerena, Accel Synchron for Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying, and El Shaddoll Winda both during your turn and your opponent's turn through Shaddoll Schism.</p><p>Anyway, I'm still trying to get used to this new deck sharing thing that came with ygoprodeck's update. Hopefully these OCG pre-release cards are visible when I tried uploading this list. Also, Firewall pass is not just a meme anymore, apparently not with the new Link-5 that this deck also plays because why not so, yeah. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</p>"

I have a new Amazoness deck for 2023 TCG format featuring all of the new awesome Amazoness support we got. I've adjusted this since last year, tweaking some ratios and side deck as well. Overall this is a really fun deck, however many decks will absolutely stomp it still. This archetype could use one more really powerful extra deck card and I think it could be truly awesome. Anyways, have fun!</p>"

Qardan is used to either get your ritual summon off or to set and activate kashtira preparations to be able to extend even more on turn 1. The addition of the Dinomorphia package is hilarious and shuts down so many other decks. I know 60 seems like a lot but thats why I maximized the Kashtiras and mimimized the other packages.

However the tools at this deck disposible needs you to have a very good understand other archtype well, this in a anti-meta deck afterall.</p><p>This deck does not like flunder, which is why there is backrow hate build in, and generic hand traps like imperm and ash. Against tears and graveyard reliant deck, is where this deck excels. Like tear with havnis, you play on your opponent turn, banishing resources left, right and centre.</p><p>The design of this version is to hopefully not combo to the point of being nib and have nothing to clap back with, however the OTK lines are all there, once you have simplify the board state.&nbsp;</p><p>Digging for Martha and Pax, these two cards are your playmaker and the bloodline of the deck, however this is not entirely true because of how it is designed, (i basically got tired of being nib and have nothing to come back with). vadis and arment is full combo on your opponents turn, carpiderm works overtime, when you know what you opponent is playing. vadis into any exosister, arment into gabine or mikalis, gives you a banish or negate, call out their play starter with carpiderm, and watch them make a imperfect board.</p><p>flunder is robina, @gnister is the field card, tears is kit, branded is lubellion/ branded fusion.</p><p>The deck does not rely on the die roll, they will expect you to make a full board but keeping the board simple and cut of there lines from OTKs gives you plenty of follow up. the side deck alters the profile to a more familiar combo deck found in everyone else's profile.</p><p>the deck still natural run shifter even in this control form.</p><p>The biggest twist in this deck profile is the addition of lord of the heavenly prison, to active protect backrow, instead of judgement it can also grab any spell or trap for follow out play when summoned. The addition of megaclop in the extra deck is because there were a lot of situation where i had enough xyz to make and, I had a really hard time outing scareclaw tri-heart. the monster is a tank, and against tear they need exactly the field card to out it, but the ability to take your opponent card for a xyz in the grave, gives a bit of grind game, it is the only graveyard interaction and the effect triggers martha to xyz. win-win</p><p>i have really enjoyed this deck this month, managing to come second in my local, the new banlist start soon, and never being a fan of floorgates, i hope this take is insightful, and i may come back to it, if it gets new support, or if tears runs too rampert with the unlimited reprints coming out.</p>"

Each of the maindeck monsters has a unique effect to it specifically and additionally all Weather monsters can banish themselves until the next standby phase to activate the effects of the archetype's Spell and Traps. Seeing many of these monsters <em>place </em>spell and traps and banish themselves as cost for effects the deck can run almost every floodgate under the sun. The deck is only mildly inconvenienced by powerful floodgates Anti-Spell Fragrance, Skill Drain &amp; Macro Cosmos, and Rivelry of the Warlord &amp; Dimentional Fissure play into the deck's strenghts.</p><p>With the release of DIFO the deck got its almost custom card Field Spell which lets you:</p><p>1. Place 1 Weather S/T when used</p><p>2. Perform an additional normal summon of a Weather monster</p><p>3. Use The Weather spell and traps as link materials</p><p>The field spell has enabled the deck to make its Link-3 monster The Weather Painter Rainbow on turn 1 which turns every Weather monster it points at into an omni-negate. EVERY. SINGLE. TURN.&nbsp;</p><p>With the december banlist The Weather got a decent boost in power. More floodgates then ever are now availible to the deck which increases its potential in the current meta significantly. Macro Cosmos and Dimentional Fissure to 3 is massive for the deck because it doesn't care for banishing, and while Macro Cosmos is less desirable seeing we do sometimes want our spells/traps to go to the GY it is not a hard requirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Weather Painters</strong></p><p>3x Snow - This is your main starter. Snow can place a Weather spell/trap which helps you search for Snowy Canvas.</p><p>3x Cloud - Spell/Trap recursion while on the field, works amazingly with the Field Spell</p><p>2x Thundery - Can place any Weather Spell/Trap on the field at the cost of a continous Spell/Trap. This helps you out your own floodgates if you want to get rid of them for whatever reason</p><p>1x Sun - Can summon itself from the GY at the cost of a continous S/T</p><p>1x Rain - if special summoned (which its unbanish effect counts as) you can place 1 Weather S/T from your hand. This helps you bypass your own Anti-Spell Fragrance</p><p>1x Aurora - Protects your Weather S/T. Easily brought out using Rainbowed Canvas</p><p><strong>Weather S/T</strong></p><p>3x Snowy Canvas - Banish a Weather Monster to search any Weather Card. Used to search for the Field Spell</p><p>3x The Weather Forecast - See above for the effects. This card is just broken</p><p>1x Rainy Canvas - We just need additional Canvas numbers and this is the least bad spell availible. Returns a spell/trap to the hand, can be used to out difficult cards like TCOBO</p><p>2x Thundery Canvas - Can bounch an oppenent's monster during the damage step. Great card against any Extra Deck monster</p><p>1x Rainbowed Canvas -&nbsp; &nbsp;Can Special Summon 1 Weather Monster. Helps bring out Aurora and turn after turn this adds bodies onto the field/</p><p><strong>Other cards</strong></p><p>1x Pankertops - We often find ourselves with an empty board which can make bringing out Pank easy</p><p>3x Piri Reis Map - Snow is a 0 atk and your main starter. Of course we run Piri</p><p>3x Imperm - Best handtrap in the game</p><p><strong>Floodgates</strong></p><p>3x Macro Cosmos &amp; Dimentional Dissue - Banishing monsters is fun especially when your opponent is running a graveyard deck</p><p>2x Anti-Spell - We place spells so we dont care about Anti-Spell</p><p>2x Skill Drain - Banish for cost means we can play under Skill Drain. We do lose things like the on field effect of Cloud but it is a worthwhile trade-off</p><p>2x Summon Limit - Moonbow can banish 2 of your opponent's monsters on a quick effect which will be summoned next turn. This can effectivly lock your opponent from summoning</p><p><strong>Extra Deck</strong></p><p>2x Rainbow - See above for the effects. this card is just broken that we can bring it out first turn</p><p>2x Moonbow - Can lock your opponent from summoning in combination with Summon Limit. Also if it gets destroys it just summons a Rainbow</p><p>2x Break Sword - Our main monsters are level 3s so we run rank 3</p><p>1x Leviar - We banish so Leviar definitly has its usage returning to the hand especially seeing we can normal summon twice</p><p>1x Zeus - We run XYZ monsters so we run Zeus it is that simple</p><p>The rest are just the usual list of suspects of Link Monsters, we dont often go into them but all of them can be useful.

Below I've explained the choices in tech cards/side deck cards and the choices that differ from most other dark world decks i've seen</p><p>-Reign-Beaux at 1 - it does nothing on the field, but is a useful extender so I would either have 1 or 2 copies, three isn't necessary<br />-Grapha at 2 - Due to searchability through Snoww and Reign-Beaux in addition to the decks fantastic draw power, 2 copies is all that is necessary<br />-Sillva at 1 - Searchable as above, plus, in combination with Ceruli and Akashic Magician, there is a recurrable anti-Fenrir loop where Ceruli being on your opponents side of the field will prevent Fenrir summons<br />-Gates at 2 - it's the most searchable card in the deck - it is also very rare that duels last long enough for 3 copies to be needed. The third copy never came up in testing<br />-Allure of Darkness over Dark World Dealings - DWD lets your opponent discard. Against Tears this is a big no-go. Side in DWD only after you know what your opponent is playing<br /><br />-Mothman in side deck - Mothman is in the side deck because of the same reason DWD is in the side deck, only side in if you know your opponent is not playing Tearlaments<br />-Bigfoot and Nessie at 3 - As for Bigfoot, this is because the deck will contain more level 8s will synergise with Grapha for more drawpower from trade-in as well as provide more material for Hope-Harbinger, which will also combo with Ceruli for Fenrir-hate. Additionally, Bigfoot is good removal for D Fissure and Macro Cosmos now that they are unlimited as these anti-tear cards will be common in the current meta but are also very strong against DW. Nessie is at 3 over Thunderbird or Chupacabra (common picks in other DW decks) because it provides an additional search to get to Bigfoot, which is good for reasons already described.&nbsp;<br /><br />-Mask Change and dark law package - Mask Change II synergises well with the play style - additionally, banish from hand is broken against almost anything that isn't Floo<br /><br />-Zalamander Catalyzer in side - free special summon of itself or a DW monster and becomes a 1 card resource loop<br /><br />Other good tech choices: Gozen Match, Infip, Zephyros, Skill Drain, Dark World Punishment, Thunderbird, Chupacabra, Beginning of The End, Dark Ruler no More<br /><br />Feel free to give feedback!&nbsp;</p>"

It still sits as the premiere deck to play despite banning of ""Curious, The Lightsworn Dominion"" and soon to be hits of the Ishizu and Bystial engine (Bystial isn't entirely their doing, but we know that Tearlaments will be scapegoated for the Bystial hits in order to not give Kashtira anymore needed fuel coming their Spring 2023). Now what is anything but new is that not only Branded, but Invoked wreaks the neverending body count that Tearlaments have been putting up with since their release. I will explain more below; but keep in mind out of two I added to the Tearlaments arsenal, I do like Branded for the consistency (despite how easy still is to get Mechaba and possibly Purgatrio on the field if I ever wanted to play it). For now all remains the same with the same song and dance we've been dealing with since the beginning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Invoked engine in the variant I made is the standard ""go for Mechaba and flank opposing staples"" kind of scenario. Granted I regretted to add Purgatrio because of ""Spright Elf"", but then I came to realize how playing ""Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly tired Tapir"" is more important than worrying about ""Ash blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"" this format. However the result for this is about a forty percent success rate of summoning Mechaba (or even Augoeides), for the reason being that Aleister (and partially Invocation) is sacrificed for the milling effects of the Ishizu and Tearlament cards. When on the field though (Mechaba) is pretty damn useful to have alongside your other comrades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Branded engine has been on the rise as of late due to consistency and how it play wells with Tearlaments in general (at least in my opinion, but I'm not as smart compared to the enlightened intellectuals Yu-Gi-Oh has to offer nowadays). The most crucial benefactor of the Branded/Tearlaments synergy I've noticed is that you can go into Lubellion or Masquerade by simply using ""Branded Fusion"" to mill any Tearlaments monster with ""Fallen of Albaz"", which would do the normal Tearlaments effects as it would. With this also, you could go into ""Predaplant Dragostapelia"" with this scenario, but only to be careful as chain linking precisely is important. Bystial monsters can also be used in the Branded scheme as a last resort for Lubellion's effect to put ""Bystial Druiswurm"" and/or ""Bystial Saronir"" back in the deck for later use, but you shouldn't have to unless otherwise.&nbsp;</p>"

Trash 2 of the pieces of Exodia with Magical Stone (for a Golden Bamboo Sword) and get them back with Mass Production. Your 2nd Magical Stone (again ideally bringing back a Golden Bamboo Sword) can trash unusable cards and/or a Cursed Bamboo. Use Foolish Burial for a Cursed Bamboo Sword.

I made some deck changes to play less garnets. Allure of darkness is really powerful in this deck. You have to use three copies by banishing exodia pieces or summoner monk. Then you can use pot of acquisitiveness to shuffle your banished monsters back into the deck and draw one. Magicians souls can pop the cursed bamboo swords to draw one or two cards then you can use the effect of cursed bamboo sword to search golden or original bamboo sword. You can generate a massive amount of spellcounters by the bamboo engine and also the toon engine. Spell power grasp is also really good to generate even more spell counters. Here the card by card:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5x Pieces of Exodia: this is your primary and only win condition</p><p>3x Royal Magical Library: you always wanna see this card. Wouldn't cut</p><p>1x Summoner Monk: gets you access into library. Can discard cursed bamboo sword to generate advantage and also can be banished by allure of darkness</p><p>1x Anchamoufrite: no extra deck, this card acts like upstart</p><p>1x Magicians Souls: can destroy up to two cards and draw the same amount. Really good card, can destroy cursed bamboo sword and toon-world. You wanna destroy two copies of cursed bamboo sword</p><p>1x Illusion of Chaos: gets you access into souls and also makes souls life</p><p>3x Cursed Bamboo Sword: gets you access to golden bamboo sword and original bamboo sword. This card can bounce back one other cursed or original bamboo sword to hand to generate spellcounters but this is once per turn.</p><p>3x Golden Bamboo Sword: basically pot of greed</p><p>1x Original Bamboo Sword: makes golden bamboo sword life as well as cursed bamboo sword. You can send this card to your graveyard to equip one cursed bamboo sword from deck, but this doesn't generate a spellcounter. Nevertheless you have to do this so you don't draw into cursed bamboo sword</p><p>1x Foolish Burial Goods: to get cursed bamboo sword in the graveyard and search. This card is once per turn, so only one copy of it</p><p>3x Toon Table of Contents: this card can search itself and generates 4 spellcounters</p><p>1x Toon-World: Just fodder, one copy is fine</p><p>3x Magical Mallet: to shuffle back cards you don't need at the moment or to shuffle back exodia pieces</p><p>3x Allure of Darkness: basically pot of greed if you banish exodia pieces or summoner monk</p><p>1x Pot of Acquisitivness: allows you to shuffle 3 banished exodia pieces in the deck and draw one</p><p>1x Double Summon: sometimes you need a second library</p><p>1x Piri-Reis Map: you have to activate it at the start of main phase 1, gets you into library. In my former build I played 3 copies. This wasn't good enough because you don't wanna draw into the map. It's like if you have it, you activate it. But If you can't it's useless. I think 5 chances to get librarys is enough</p><p>1x Wonder Wand: this card is alwyas for magicians souls. Sometimes you have like 4 exodia pieces and only wonder wand and library on the field, then you can risk it</p><p>1x Top Share: this card can get you access into everything</p><p>2x Spell Power Grasp: searches itself and generates 2 spellcounters</p><p>1x Into the Void</p><p>1x Upstart Goblin</p><p>1x One Day of Peace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have recommendations or criticism please let me know.

The inspiration for this deck comes from another post on ygoprodeck by user qbrsb3; I just made some changes to make the deck more consitent and more affordable for a Master Duel player.</p><p>The deck functions through Code Talker's incredible ability to extra deck spam. Cynet Codec is pivotal. It is the binding agent that without, the deck falls apart. If you don't start off with Codec, you can search for it by linking off Micro Coder. If you don't have Micro in hand, you can search it out using either Lady Debug or Cynet Mining. If you start of with Mining, and only Mining, I recommend searching out Lady Debug to search Micro just to thin out deck.</p><p>From there, link away; your goal is to gather up key ingredients while putting as many link monsters in the graveyard as possible. The cards needed are Cynet Fusion and Clock Wyvern, and to get them is simple, but can be a detriment if you don't have extenders. Clock Spartoi adds fusion, and Excode Talker can add Wyvern using Cynet Codec's effect. You will then fusion summon CD, activate its ability to mill those few extra cards, and immediately link it off to the graveyard. The final goal is to have a board that ends on any two cyberse monsters (including tokens) to link summon Clock Lizard.</p><p>Clock Lizard will send CD from your GY back to the extra deck and then fusion it back to field using material from the GY.</p><p>After milling your deck, Starliege can activate its ability to add Levianeer from GY to hand, Levianeer can special summon itself <strong>using only light monsters&nbsp;</strong>to summon Catapult Turtle, and finally Turtle can tribute a monster to inflict damage to your opponent equal to half the attack of the monster tributed. Tribute your 20k+ attack Clock Dragon for game.</p><hr /><p>Important things to consider before summoning Clock Dragon for the second time:</p><p>Pay attention to the link ratings you are using. CD mills an amount equal to the link rating used for its summon, so if you use more than the amount needed to mill the deck, the ability will not activate and you will fail the FTK. Likewise, if you don't use enough link ratings you might not mill your whole deck, and the final components to the FTK <em>may</em> not be available for use... and you'll fail the FTK.</p><p><strong>Do not use Transcode Talker's ability</strong><strong>!</strong> You will lock into Cyberse and you will fail the FTK.</p><p>Again, only use light monsters to summon Levianeer so you can use his ability to summon Turtle.</p><p>Codec is very powerful, consider your options when picking a cyberse to add for the maximum extension, and remember every monster's ability is a hard once per turn.</p><p>Finally, this is an FTK and RNG is not your friend. Not only do you need to win the coin flip and not brick on your opening, but this deck can not handle Ash Blossom. Nine times out of ten, if your opponent Ashes anything you will fail the FTK (Droll and Lockbird isn't great either). With that said, this deck can play through a majority of hand traps most of the time. It's even possible to play through Nibiru and, on rarer occassions, Maxx C if they don't draw Ash.</p>"

Your win con is relying on tenyi special summons to enable your red rose dragon to search for more black rose engine cards or letting your tenyi and sword soul cards carry you to synchro summons. Extra deck has a wide variety of tools. For instance Ruddy rose can empty your opponents graveyard and Chaos Ruler can fill it back up with tenyi cards. Pankratops is a multi use card with your level 3 and level 1 tuners. Protos and swordsoul engine can be searched with waterfall. You can easily adjust values too add more hand traps, but you should play all three engines (red rose, sword soul, and tenyi) to not brick as all three engines have synergy. You can summon mo ye for instance and then use basal to put out a red rose dragon your red rose can turn into a rose dragon and then summon a white rose dragon to the field to make a level 8 with the token tuner card left over for instance. It could be longyuan and red rose into denglong and another level 8 as well. I think there are alot of other synchro combos I haven't yet thought of, but just getting out the swordsoul synchro is already so strong. The advantage this deck has over swordsoul imo is that it lets you get to two level 10 tuners on turn 1 way more easily than traditional swordsoul. While you can still play swordsoul like normal that rose dragon cards at a bit of confusion since your opponent might not have expected a baron to come after a qixing and end up not playing a negate in their expecting a moye or taiya and not the red rose into baron that can't be negated without wasting two hand traps letting you get another rose dragon card to the field for even more synchro summons.&nbsp;</p>"

This time, I'm using the metalfoes non-effect fusion monsters, who need for material a Metalfoes monster and any other monsters that have below a certain attack. Once those are on the field, you can use the Tenyi cards (which were milled by your Tearlaments) to build up board presence or break your opponent's field. This is just a random idea, so I likely won't actually get the cards for this one... Besides, I feel like this will be less consistent than the average Tearlaments deck (It doesn't help that I'm not willing to spend $200 on three reinohearts and three primeval planets).</p><p>Feedback is welcome if you have any, and I hope that this deck is either interesting, or gives you a good laugh.</p>"

All the anti-GY techs and new cards absolutely destroy any Sky Striker strategy since GY manipulation is the best way to counter Tearlaments. Bystial, Ishizu, all hard counter our favorite mech pilot Raye since they easily manipulate the GY, rendering her powerless and defenseless. <br /><br />The Mystic Mine ban from the recent banlist proved to be the final nail in the coffin for competitive Sky Striker, losing their strong tool to slow down the meta which moves incredibly fast - way too fast for even Sky Striker cards to catch up. <br /><br />HOWEVER, adversity forces dedicated Sky Striker players to let go of their crutches holding them back from truly skilled gameplay (I personally think Mystic Mine was a crutch :3) and it allows for some creativity to shine forth! <br /><br />After a lot of brainstorming, Runick Sky Striker is the best idea I can come up with! Combining Sky Striker's control + resource generation with Runick's make for a extremely potent grindy deck! Since Sky Striker and Runick excel in a long grind game of resources, a combination of both of their strategies push each other to competitive viability! (<span>I'm not coping I swear lmao</span>) <br /><br />Borrowing some ideas from earlier Runick Sky Striker lists established online, I made and tested my own list that best fits the current meta.</p><p>This deck is a variant of my earlier Runick strategy, ""A Beginner's Guide to Naturia Runick,"" feel free to check it out for the full guide! <br /><br /></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Want to see the deck in action?

If played properly and correctly, you should be able to control your opponent to death, and even deck them out. <br /><br />Sky Striker's usual win condition of OTKing with Accesscode Talker or Linkage is usually unavailable with Runick, since the strategy skips your battle-phase, so your games generally tend to be a long-winded game of control and resources - one where Runick and Striker excels in. <br /><br />The general set-up is establish Runick Fountain coupled with Multirole and Engage in rotation. With Runick Fountain, Multirole and Engage cycling every turn, you should be drawing 5 cards (3 with fountain and 2 with engage), recycling GY Sky Striker spells, and slowly but surely decking out your opponent until they surrender!<br /><br />Start by summoning Hugin with any Runick quick-play spell. Get your +1-3 draw with Runick Fountain, then somehow summon the appropriate Sky Striker Ace in your Extra Monster Zone. If you have Linkage, you can use your Runick monster to summon a Sky Striker Ace (usually Kagari or Shizuku). <br /><br />Set-up Multirole as well, since it effectively recycles your Sky Striker GY spells everyturn.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Although not ideal, you can also go for a purely milling strategy using Runick Allure. That card absolutely slaughters opponent's decks since Runick Sky Striker uses many quick play spells per turn. During testing, I found Allure to be a ""win-more"" card, and it didn't really contribute much to the gamestate/win condition of resources. The opponent would surrender knowing they will run out of resources much earlier than they would actually deck out due to Runick Allure. That's why I put Runick Allure and Munin in the side-deck.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">GENERAL TIPS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If your opponent attempts to negate/remove Hugin with a targeting effect (ex. Imperm or Veiler), you can use Linkage to dodge the negate and summon a Sky Striker Ace.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Before recycling your Runick spells in your GY with Runick Fountain's draw effect, try to use your Sky Striker cards first since the GY is packed with spells - turning on your additional Sky Striker effects.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Sky Striker Eagle Booster works wonders for this deck - it allows you to dodge OTKs, renders your monster nigh invincible in the Extra Monster Zone for a turn, allows you to dodge negation - etc. Remember, it can be also used to protect your Runick monsters!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Remember that Runick Fountain can draw cards during your turn AND your opponent's turn! You can theoretically draw 6 cards before it's your turn again (given you have proper GY and hand set-up)! Remember to keep the GY and hand in mind when you use Runick spells.</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Ishizu shufflers effectively shut down Runick Fountain's draw effect since it targets Runick spells in GY to shuffle back into your deck. Try to clear your opponent's GY shufflers with cards like Sky Striker Shark Cannon before attempting to activate Fountain's effect! </li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Runick spells skip only 1 Battle Phase - the Battle Phase is still an option for finishing off your opponent's life points. If your opponent has no more resources and you can attack for game, you can still enter the battle phase after you've skipped one earlier to finish off your opponent!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Decks that counter Tearlaments are usually also bad match-ups for this deck - like Floowandereeze and Dracoslayers (the variant that turbos out Necrovalley). Be sure to side appropriately for those match-ups. Luckily, this deck naturally outs anti-GY floodgates like Macro Cosmos, Necrovalley and Dimension Fissure with Runick and Sky Striker spells.<br /><br /></li></ul><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">CONCLUDING COMMENTARY<br /></strong><span class=""ContentPasted0""><br />I WILL USE SKY STRIKER EVERY FORMAT!!! Even when Raye isn't competitively viable anymore, I WILL FIND A WAY TO PLAY SKY STRIKER!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />I know I'm coping hard (Lets face it, this deck is still a fragile ""glass cannon""), but this deck is fairly terrifying when it gets going, using two quick play toolboxes to counter every threat my opponent comes up with. Need to negate a monster on the field? -&gt; Widow Anchor and Freezing Curses! Need to destroy a card on the field? -&gt; Afterburners and Flashing Fire! Need to protect your own card? -&gt; Eagle Booster and Slumber!</span><strong class=""ContentPasted0""> <br /></strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">I also find it thematically cool that instead of Sky Striker fighting for you, you're actually fighting ALONGSIDE Raye, since Runick implies you're the warrior on the field battling your opponent. So cool! Time to live out your favourite Elder Scrolls/DOOMSLAYER fantasy!<br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to ask them below! Remember, Raye is Bae!

Reason is that it synergizes around the cards it plays and interact with. I will show you examples of why these choices are best.&nbsp;</p><p>Your goal is to search both Rod for SoDM and Souls for DM (or DMG) to bring out The Dark Magicians. But this will show you other ways to draw and search other cards that can useful.</p><p>Rod can search: Circle, Bond, SoDM, Servant, Inheritance, DBM, and Eternal.&nbsp;</p><p>Illusion can search: Rod, Timaeus, DM, DMG, Apprentice, and Souls.&nbsp;</p><p>Servant can search: Rod, Illusion, DM, DMG, Apprentice, Souls, Circle, Bond, SoDM, Servant, Inheritance, DBM, Eternal, and even itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Restage can summon: Souls (for a extender to bring out Crowley and a draw), Rod, and Spellbook Magician.</p><p>Crowley can search: Magician, Secrets, Knowledge, and Power (so you wont waste your normal summon, also you can add any Spellbook cards to your hand, super underrated underused card btw, def your key card also).&nbsp;</p><p>Preparation can search Illusion and can be used for a draw (by Souls) and can be used for a banish (by Inheritance). Good synergy to have it at 3!</p><p>Magicalized can summon: Dragoon or Quintet (to backup Dragon Knight or Master of Chaos) to destroy monsters.</p><p>SoDM can OTK by attack or disrupt by summoning destruction: TDMs, Quintet, and Chimera (also who can draw cards).</p><p>Inheritance can banish Preparation, Restage, and etc Spell Cards you already used to search any DM Spell/Trap, including Servant and Eternal.&nbsp;</p><p>You can still pull off the Bond combo to destroy the opponents field and you can setup the Dragon Knight lock combo also.&nbsp;</p><p>This deck has a lot of combos and synergy. Very consistent opening hands as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Tech choices: Piercing the Darkness = Spellbook of Power, Bond &amp; DBM = Navigation &amp; Combination, 2 Inheritance &amp; 2 Prep = 1 Inheritance &amp; 3 Prep and 2 Apprentice = 1 DMG.&nbsp;</p><p>Another tech choice can be Branded Fusion (at 2), Albaz (at 1), Lubellion (at 1), Albion (at 1). The synergy would be to dump any DMs, DMGs, Palladiums for draw power while setting up the Dragon Knight lock. Also you can dump Souls in case if you have Restage in your hand to bring it back for a draw extender also.&nbsp;</p><p>Best deck easily!</p><p>Enjoy the deck!

Anyway compared to B. Despia the deck is still quite good at recurring and searching but also has a bit more of a negate-y final board. Standard end board is something like Dragostapelia, Mirrorjade, Predaplanning and Super Poly set, but can be better or worse depending on opening and negates. Super Poly and Ambulomelides work well as breakers, and DPE is a backup plan and searchable with Darlingtonia Cobra. It's a little rough if you draw cobra but you can shuffle it back with lubellion (the fusion, not the bystial). IDK how it matches up into tear but if I test that I might update this, maybe. Have fun :)</p>"

Yuya's exhilarating strategy keeps audiences on the edge of their seats as he deftly parries his opponent's attacks before turning the Duel on its head with Odd-Eyes Saber Dragon! The devious Declan takes the opposite approach, attacking as early and often as possible and destroying everything in his path with his D/D/D Dragon Overlord Pendragon! You can't Duel alone, so these new Starter Decks are designed to help friends, siblings, or classmates learn to Duel together. Each version of the 41-card Deck features several of that character&rsquo;s favorite cards and is tuned to teach new Duelists how to Duel right out of the box.</span></p>"

If you're familiar with the new Earth Fairy monsters that are becoming meta, than you will quickly understand how this deck works. It's pretty powerful, it's a fun way to run Obelisk. This is not a great deck though, it is at best on par with the Face Card Knights deck that's used with Slifer/Ra. It's very easy to brick with this deck and become stuck, but it still works pretty well in my opinion.</p><p>I recently updated it to include some Slimes. Guardian Slime, Metal Reflect Slime and Egyptian God Slime. It makes the deck slightly more defensively consistent.</p><p>Alright, actual final edit I think. I added a few Lightsworn Monsters and side decked some Synchro Monsters as this deck can pretty easily summon lvl 8 Synchro monsters.</p>"

The main pros of Yubel is that she is cool to play and it will make your opponent concede. The main combo is to get Yubel summoned, activated chain destruction on yourself, destroy yubels in your hand or field to summon 2 Yubel Terror Incarnates while still having the original Yubel on the field. End phase, priority says you can make 1 Terror Incarnate kill the other and base Yubel, making it so you have the Ultimate Nightmare on your field with another Terror Incarnate on the board. Prevent your opponent from killing your Yubel forms with 'Mound of the Bound Creator' and make them angry by playing 'Savage Colliseum'. Only one field spell allowed so go for whatever makes your combos good. Deck centered around forcing your opponent to hit your Yubels, and cycling through them with Traps that bring Yubels back to the field to start the combos over again.&nbsp;</p><p>Trap Trick is to search for Chain Destruction or any trap that is useful to your current hand.</p><p>If Yubel is in your hand, try and summon it with 'Stygian Patrol', or tribute summon it with 'Fires of Doomsday'.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have Mystic Tomato, you let it die and let it summon Yubel, with Sangan, search a Yubel or Mystic Tomato.</p><p>If you don't have any Yubels, either search it with the search monsters, or summon it from the graveyard with alot of traps and effects in this deck.</p><p>Side deck cards are excellent to play to immediately get Yubel on the field, as 'Neos Kluger' has Yubel listed as a material, so you play the spell and get base Yubel on the field. I don't have it in my irl deck because I can't find it anywhere!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have fun with Yubel because it's an incredibly fun deck to play! Show some Yubel some love</p>"

It's one of the easiest control decks to pick up since all you'll be doing is normal summoning a bunch of birds and locking your opponent from special summoning anything using Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds. The main deck at the lowest rarity and using alternatives is worth around $40-50. This is in comparison to Tearlament where you basically have to pull a Left Arm Offering to even get it.</p><p>When building a Floowandereeze deck, you have options to make the deck vary from other builds, like in DistantCoder's build where he plays the Dogmatika engine. If you have leftover money, you can replace Jack in the Hand with Advent. You generally don't have to care much about building your extra deck since most of the time you're not special summoning at all and it's really only used by Pot of Prosperity or in this case, Pot of Extravagance.</p><p>The side deck in this build could literally be anything. If you don't have any of the cards in the extra deck that every other deck is playing (i.e. Kitkallos, Toadally Awesome, etc.) you can replace Ghost Reaper with Infinite Impermanence or Dark Ruler No More.</p><p>That's pretty much about it really, have fun. :)</p>"

And boy, are they fun in speed duels. Let's break it down.</span></p><p><span>First, let&rsquo;s start with the monsters. We'll be running (3) Swords Woman, (2) Amazoness Trainee, (2) Amazoness Spy, (1) Amazoness Sage, and (1) Chain Master. Swords Woman is far and away our best monster, and quite possibly the best card in the deck. Paired with Heirloom, this card can use it's effect to lay some fat damage on the opponent. Trainee is a great way to keep your opponent&rsquo;s monsters out of their graveyard, and if successful can increase its attack with each kill. Spy is there for a free special summon, Sage is extra back row hate, and Chain Master is a great 1-up to snatch one of your opponent&rsquo;s monsters. With a steep cost of 1500 Life Points to use, we don't need to run more than one.</span></p><p><span>For spells, we are running (1) Village, (2) Amazoness Heirloom, (2) Hammer Shot, and (2) Night Beam. Village is a staple to run in the deck as it not only boosts our attack, but also gives us a free special summon when an Amazon is destroyed. Heirloom is our key pair card for Swords Woman as it not only protects us from an attack, but also allows an Amazon to beat over a bigger monster and destroy it for free. Hammer Shot is a must include as many meta decks run Jinzo and that's usually the highest attacking monster on the field. Finally, Night Beam is great backrow removal that your opponent&rsquo;s cannot chain the targeted card to, which is very helpful.</span></p><p><span>Lastly, we are running just a small handful of traps: (2) Amazoness Archers, and (2) Kunai with Chain. Archers is a classic way to get your opponent&rsquo;s 4-star beaters to attack into you and lose some life points, and Kunai is an essential card for protection and (more) attack boost. It&rsquo;s more important feature, however, is being able to switch an enemy's monster to defense position.</span></p><p><span>The side deck is a mixed bag of cards that will be helpful in many situations.
