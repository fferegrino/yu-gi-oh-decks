Very. Bad. My spicy techs consisted of Lappis Dragon and a singular Effect Veiler. Also my backrow removal was Mystical Space Typhoon. But let's be real, who could blame me? After all, they had just received some new shiny print. Obviously this was not an ideal deck and heavily restricted by my finances and the cards I had available. Although building a proper deck from the start instead of buying 20 more cards after realising this deck was bad would've probably saved me a nickel back.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">Someday I'll take the old deck and burn it to the ground, but until I can afford to literally burn my money, I'll just use this afternoon to build a better deck.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">The starter gotta be somebody and in this case it is Marincess Blue Tang. She's a rockstar. She's the lovechild of Salamangreat Foxy and Gazelle. Wherever she goes Marincess Sea Horse won't be far away. Tang sends Horse and that's enough to climb all the way into your link-4. Altough is it yet lacking it's protection.</span>  &nbsp;  <span lang=""EN-US"">""What protection?""</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">you might ask. If everyone cared and in case nobody knows what the Marincess archetype actually does let me give you a quick explanation of what the deck intends to do. It intends to build a tower, like a really tall one, just shy of God having to intervene. Your field spell makes any link monster in your EMZ that used Marincess Crystal Heart as material unaffected by your opponents card effects. Oh and your Marincess link monster in the EMZ will receive an ATK boost of up to 2000. </span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">So, you have an unaffected 5200 ATK beatstick on the board, you're feelin' way too damn good about yourself, as if you're flying like a satellite a million miles an hour. But then it hit's you. This isn't too bad but you've ended on a board that has no interaction. All your opponent has to do is remove one measly field spell. They've figured you out! You think there's no savin' me now and with shakin' hand your're going through your remaining cards until you stumble upon one very interesting trap card in your hand. Marincess Wave.</span>  &nbsp;  <span lang=""EN-US"">Marincess Wave.</span>  <span lang=""EN-US"">The heart and soul of your deck (well besides the other good cards). If you control a link-3 or higher Marincess monster it serves as a handtrap that is both Infinite Impermanence and Miscellaneosaurus combined. Pair that with handtraps, TT (searched off of Fury to protect your monsters) and Dinomiscus and you're having yourself a genuinely decent board. How do we get to Wave? We go diggin like Animals. Marincess Heatsoul Great Bubble Reef draws you a card every Standby Phase and Tang excavated 3 cards and if they're still buried too deep in your deck Phantazmey can help you get 'em up.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>""Where there's water a flood will soon follow."" - Me.</span>  Looking at a photograph of Marincesses one might think they'd be fishes. After all that's what they're named after (besides Great Bubble Reef. What is she, like, their home?) but in actuality they are all cyberse. Meaning you can access Accesscode under Rivalry. Rivalry, while disabling your frog engine, still allows you to use any of your link monsters and while Gozen Match might permit the usage of your Code Talkers, you still have Toadally Awesome and the Marincess Towers going for you. Fact ist, if you can play through your floodgates better than your opponent it will usually work out in the end.  &nbsp;  <span>""So many two-of's. Do you wanna see them, like, sometimes but not all the time?""</span>  Oh how you remind me of my younger self, always eager to ask questions. I'm trying not to love you but you're really make writing these so much easier for me. You'll be drawing a lot of cards during your opponent's turn, making cards that activate in hand very powerful. That's why Trap Trick is only on one copy, as it only has 2 targets, one of which can activate in hand. I rather see more handtraps (including traps in hand) than drawing into a trap trick during my opponents turn. Drawing extender's is fine too, since they're helping you play through interaction during your turn. I found Silent Angler - Marincess Mandarin to be better at 2-1 than at 1-2 since one is millable and the other has an easier summoning condition anyways. But you only wanna see it sometimes yknow. Dinomiscus technically is at 3 with trap trick, I just want the 3rd Dinomiscus to be more flexible and turn into Wave on command. TT is not a Trap Trick target since it's most wanted from Fury of Kairyu-Shin. There again I found 2-1 to be the optimal ratios as the extra Furies don't do much in hand and there aren't to many cards that discard.  &nbsp;  <span>Diversity</span>  Didn't know where to put this but on a more serious note, Marincesses are actually very adaptable. If you already have access to wave you can end on Marincess Marbled Rock to recycle your cards during your turns. Also the recursion from Marincess Coral Anemone and Marbled Rock means that one singular Marincess starter can be added back twice allowing for two discards for full Swap engine at no additional costs for discard.  &nbsp;  <span>Anypoop</span> that's it for the decklist. <span lang=""EN-US"">Never again but I made like 21 Nickelback references in here.</span>"

El tiempo gira hacia la destruc","Deck creado por: Darklab  <strong>Objetivo:</strong> Usar el efecto de Catapult Turtle para infligir un daño mortal usando al Cyberse Clock Dragon. UwU  <strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; https://youtu.be/8jFE7Mf90wI &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  <strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>  Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Halqifibrax. Para eso hay varias cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo.  <strong>Starters para invocar a Halqifibrax</strong><strong>:</strong> <ul>  	<li><strong>Carboneddon: </strong>Sólo hace falta linkearlo en Almiraj y activar su efecto en cementerio para traer a Galaxy Serpent.</li>  	<li><strong>Souleating Oviraptor: </strong>Envía al cementerio a Carboneddon.</li>  	<li><strong>Fossil Dig: </strong>Nos trae a cualquiera de los otros dos starters.</li>  	<li><strong>Plaguespreader Zombie: </strong>En este caso necesitarías un ""descarte"" más pero igual funciona, linkeándolo en Almiraj y reviviéndolo del cementerio con su efecto.</li> </ul> Hay muchos más que podrían usarse, como Draconnet, pero este conjunto me parece que es el que usa menos bricks y/o garnets. Hay que considerar también que sólo pueden llevarse 40 cartas debido a que queremos enviar toda la baraja al cementerio usando al Cyberse Clock Dragon.  <strong>Pros:</strong> <ul>  	<li>Deck bastante consistente.</li>  	<li>El deck sólo tiene 1 garnet (Shelrokket Dragon) que se puede devolver con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Crossout Designator.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>  	<li>La cantidad de links hace que sea siempre posible enviar toda la baraja al cementerio, por lo que no habrá factor suerte hacia el final.</li>  	<li>Es posible usar algunas Handtraps contra el adversario si las robas y vas segundo.</li> </ul> <strong>Contras:</strong> <ul>  	<li>El deck depende del burn, por lo que le afectan los incrementos de LP del oponente, si logra hacer los suficientes.</li>  	<li>El deck por su naturaleza no puede ser muy grande, por lo que es difícil añadirle más consistencia y/o protección.</li>  	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>  	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li> </ul>"

To start off, this is a very difficult deck to pilot because if the main combo doesn't go off, then there are back ups, but it's very hand dependent and depends where you are in the combo.  This deck has 12 two-card starters that all require your normal summon. These are Gozuki, Solitaire, Uni-Zombie, and Plaguespreader.  All of these require you to have either Vendread Slayer or Vendread Evolution in your hand  *There are a lot of ways to get Slayer through pre-prep and preparation of rites.  NOTE: I just thought of this now, you could use Vendread Nights to find Slayer easier, but I haven't tested it yet because I forgot that card existed and I'm too far into typing this to stop now. If you do want to include Nights, I recommend taking out the Drytron Cards since they're more of a ""if you draw it then it's nice"" kind of situation.  <hr />  <span>COMBO</span>  Gozuki: Normal Gozuki send Plaguespreader&gt; Plaguespreader Summon&gt; Halq Combo  Uni-Zombie: Normal Uni-Zombie&gt; Send Striges&gt;Striges Effect to Special Summon itself&gt; Halq Combo  Solitaire: Normal Solitaire&gt; Tribute Solitaire for Uni-Zombie&gt; Uni-Zombie effect send Striges or Mezuki&gt; Summon back whichever monster&gt; Halq Combo  *If Solitaire gets negated, you have the option of linking into Almiraj and extending  Plaguespreader: Normal Plaguespreader&gt; Link into Almiraj&gt; Special Summon back Plaguespreader&gt; Halq Combo  Halq Combo: Link into Halq&gt; Summon Deskbot 001&gt; Link into Auroradon&gt; Special Summon tokens&gt; trigger 001 special summon&gt;  Destroy 1 Token and Auroradon to Special Summon Warbluran&gt; Synchro 001 and token into a Herald of the Arch Light&gt; Use Warbluran effect to Tribute Token to raise its level by 1&gt;Synchro into Coral Dragon&gt;Herald effect add Vendread Evolution or Vendread Slayer&gt; Activate Evolution by sending 1 Slayer from deck&gt;  Special Summon Slayer&gt; Synchro into Ultimaya Tzolkin&gt;CL 1 Slayer eff, then CL 2 Coral Dragon effect to chain block&gt; Draw a card off of Coral Dragon&gt;  Search Revendread Origin and send Vendread Anima, Houndhorde, or Striges NOTE: if you have another Vendread card in hand you don't need at this point, then send houndhorde so you can summon him back and get his Spell/Trap Banishing eff.&gt; SET Revendread Origin&gt; Trigger Tzolkin to summon out Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon&gt; Activate Origin and banish slayer from grave&gt; Special Summon other Slayer.  This is the End of the Combo and if you have Ecclesia or Nadir Servant, then use those effects at the end and do the Dogmatika Combo Stuff&gt;  The Following Turn: Basically try to set up lethal using what you have left on board.  When Slayer eventually hits the grave&gt; Search Evolution and Send Battlelord&gt; Use Evolution to send another Battlelord from deck&gt; Special Battlelord&gt; use his Shockmaster esque effect to stop activations and effects depending on what you need.  <span>SIDE DECK EXPLANATION:</span> So you're probably wondering why I have Chtugua, Gallant Granite, and Abyss Dweller in the Side deck. Basically this is your 2'nd game contingency plan against combo and break your board decks. What you do is that when you get to the Auroradon Stage, you have Warbluran, 2 tokens, and a 001  Synchro Summon Herald using 001 and a token&gt;Synchro Summon Cthugua using Warbluran and a token&gt;Xyz into Gallant Granite or Abyss Dweller.  You get a free draw from Cthugua and when you detach Material, you detach Herald so that you get a search for Slayer or a Ritual Spell.  Gallant Granite gets Nibiru or Abyss Dweller locks the grave from your opponent.  NOTE: Replace Tzolkin, Crystal Wing, and Coral Dragon, since you won't be using them. I include both gallant granite and Abyss dweller when I Side deck mainly just for the off chance I draw Nibiru.  Vendreads can easily setup again through link climbing and using Battlelord to stop activations and effects of a type in order to assure you otk.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This is the part where It depends on what you have because Vendreads are very good at link climbing, so you can link away Slayer with Tzolkin or other cards to make a Verte Anaconda and using the Slayer effect to grab a ritual spell and send Striges or Houndhorde. From here, you can Special Summon back the Striges or Houndhorde&gt; Ritual Summon Slayer again&gt; Link into I:P Masquerena&gt; Verte Anaconda eff Sending Red-Eyes Fusion&gt; Send Dark Magician and Black Dragon&gt; Summon Dragoon&gt; Use I:P Masquerena with Anaconda to make a destruction protected Avramax on your opponents turn if you don't get lethal.  Link climbing in this deck is the back-up I was talking about at the start. If your opponent doesn't let you get to Halq, then at the very least try to get a Dragoon on board.  <span>IMPORTANT NOTES</span>: To get to Dragoon Easily all you need to do is Normal a Striges or Houndhorde, then use their effects to be summoned back.  Foolish is an extender by pitching any recursive Zombie and it can Send Revendread Slayer if you need it.  Revendread Origin is NOT Once per turn, so you should abuse this card if you get the opportunity.  Vendread Anima LOCKS you into Zombies if you use its Grave effect for the rest of the turn.  The Drytron package is an assurance for your Ritual Summons since they can't be negated with the Field Spell. The Field spell can grab Meteor Shower or Asterism. Asterism is used for going second and Meteor Shower is for going first(Most of the time).  If you don't get the combo and you can't link climb, then use the Dogmatika Engine to get Maximus, so that you can send a Herald and a Titaniklad to set up ritual and Dogmatika plays. If you're going second, then you should be sending N'tiss so you can start breaking your opponents board.  Drawing Battlelord for your opening hand can be amazing because you have the possibility of protecting your link climbing from hand traps with his effect.  Vendread Revenants comes up very rarely as a useful monster, but if does come up where you have option of using Revenants Ritual Summon material effect to banish Special Summoned monsters at quick effect speed. If this monster had a better way of recurring itself from the graveyard, this would be such a good card. The easiest way to set this up is to banish Revenants from the grave, then using anima to special summon it back. This rarely happens though.  Side decking for this deck is easy for me because I take out the 5 Drytron Cards + Terraforming in order to fit 6 side deck cards. Those are the easy choices for side decking, but you can also side deck out 1 houndhorde, striges, and anima if you want more of a chance to draw a hand trap or equalizer.  <span>FINAL WORDS</span>  Well first of all thank you for reading this far and being interested in this abomination I call a viable deck. I have always loved vendreads and I simply cannot let the archetype die.  I'm by no means a competitor, but I do know a lot about the game and I really enjoy making ""terrible decks"" just a little more viable.  I can't wait to run this deck when locals come back and also when Dogmatika Cards stop being so goddamn expensive.  On that note, for the love of god if you can't afford Forbidden Droplet, please don't hesitate to switch it out for an ash blossom or whatever you prefer.  I honestly can't believe it's that expensive.  Anyways, again thank you for reading."

Summon Chaos Ancient Gear Giant to obliterate your opponent.  The main idea of this deck is to get to your Fusion Ancient Gears as soon as possible, while keeping the board under control via a machina engine and big XYZ's Monsters. I included only on AG Fusion, as it is my deck irl, so if you want play 2 or maybe 3 to get easier fusions.  -The machina engine is very basic if you draw the machina spell you can get a free machina fortress protected by a citadel and thin your deck by 2 cards.  -Derricrane and the Bullet Train help with the XYZ Rank 10 Summons, its especially easy if you combine them with Flying Pegasus.  -Galaxy Cyclone is used to pop your own Geartown to get what you need for your Fusions.  -You can also use AG Ballista if your opponent has a field up Monster.

If you feel like you aren't seeing <strong>''red-eyes fusion''</strong> enough even though you play 3 copies.. welllll you can play <strong>Trickstar  nightshade</strong> into <strong>Trickstar Blossom</strong> for a one card <strong>Verte Anaconda</strong> combo , <strong>Dotscaper</strong> into L<strong>inkuribo</strong> or <strong>Relinquished</strong> <strong>Anima </strong>can do the same thing for <em>maximum efficiency.</em> You can also include the red-eyes card that searches the fusion spell but it goes against the whole dark magician theme.  But really low key, dark magicians are actually not bad ever since soul servant and magicians' soul got printed. They have a decent fusion also that draws an extra card every turn.  Also bond between teacher and student into dark burning magic is crazy fun even thou it is kinda slow."

I tossed in a Numeron Engine to give it a small boost.  The main appeal comes from summoning the big XYZ's Monster with the help of cards like Bullet Liner and Derricrane. Flying Pegasus is also an easy way to copy the high ranks of other monsters to net you a nice Superdreadnought combo. I put in some Twintwisters for backrow and to get the Machina Citadel from your hand if its stuck and you have no Fortress on hand. Because I wanted to include the Infinitrack Megaclops, I threw in a Numeron Engine to get it out for free if you have no board (Activate Numeron Wall, Summon Field Spell, Summon the 3 Gate XYZ's and then Megaclops).  The stickiness of Machina Citadell and Fortress gives you good survivability and your beefy XYZ finisher should get the job done. Due to having 3 different Rank 10 XYZ options, the deck is flexible enough to assess any threat.  If you have improvements or ideas, I would be happy to read upon them in the comments."

Put alternative on the board and link into halqi ...and pray your opponents dont have interruptions  Incase of interruptions we still have Triple tactics talents and called by the grave, but if all goes good halq summons another egg - egg into an Elpy special Levianeer by banishing 3 lights but leave 1 stone of legends to special summon to make pisty. Special summon your single copy of Starliege Seyfert - then go into Saryuja and hopefully fix your hand to advance plays into your preferable plays. Nebula is a sweet tech card that can unbrick your hand into an immediate number 97: Draglubion  2)the white stone of legends is searchable so you can play only 2 of it + There is a good amount of level 8s in the deck, so i choose to play 3 trade-in +  2 cards of consonance(for stones of ancients ideally) - TTT can help you avoid nibiru + upstart slims your deck  3)Chaos emperor is also a level 8 that can recover from the banished and can summon itself from the extra deck by banishing a light and a dark  4)Ash and called by the grave is a must. Dragon shrine and return of the dragon lords are outdated cards so i advice to not play them  Optional cards:  -Deep-eyes is probably holding this deck back ...but you play many dragons and the burn is quite hilarious if it goes through  -Skill drain, most of your monsters are THICC in stats  - Lancea and nibiru are sided because it can be dead against certain decks  -Goliath is also a level 8 dragon that locks your opponent from the extra deck  Going second cards:  Dark ruler no more  Harpies duster  .............................................................................  Conclusion:  My first guide go easy on me, i prefer dark magician over blue-eyes cause its requires less IQ and dragoon just carries you to the win  But this deck is quite solid in my opinion most of it is based on the deck list i saw teamsamuraiX1 did on youtube, but i modified to how i play it.

Combine it with Macro Cosmos and your opponents GY plays get foiled, while you just SS your Monsters via Escape from the Dark Dimension.  -Gizmek Orochi provides a durable Dark Machine and Rank 8 for XYZ Summons.  -Metal Reflect Slime helps with easier Rank 10 XYZ's and Cyber Stein can throw out an unexpected hurdle for the opponent.

During the opponent's turn, Shadow Lich generates a token off a Quick Effect, which you can then use Masquerena's Quick Effect to go into a Link 4, which in this Extra Deck is either Knightmare Gryphon or Linkmail Archfiend, depending on the rest of your board state. With Linkmail, any of your other Extra Deck Monsters are protected from monster effects. Gryphon would potentially lock your opponent out of activating effects unless they can Link with Gryphon.  The rest of the deck is pretty straightforward in terms of its combos. D/D/D strongly excels at negating spell/trap effects, and the rest of the extra deck is designed to assist in monster negates."

Limit extra deck summons with traps. High LP  gained from banishing gives you extra time. 8 star dragravion XYZ options. Post Union Carrier ban, so no Dragon/Wizard Buster Destruction Swords for Mystic Mine. NecroFace recycles deck to prevent deck out. Try to Golden Sarcophagus it ASAP. Use Glife to get Golden Castle to summon Hexe Trude and banish 8 for Gizmek for Number Dragons or XYZ of choice. Other pieces of the Fairytale set can be included to protect the castle. Super poly is necessary for Mudragon. It protects your monster/s that are going for the finish. Offense is the main strategy, and defense is good. Has control capabilities . Recovery from disruption is a little difficult, but not impossible with the raw draw power of this deck. This deck has many variations and can beat many of the newer decks if played well. Side deck is for a few extra strategies for a paradigm change, but feel free to find some cards to include to dismantle a major enemy. Does surprisingly well given that this deck is a mash up of stuff that centers on banishing and it does have synergy despite not being an Archetype deck."

The primary deck engine depends on Nekroz, while the secondary Drytron engine offers great synergy and support. In addition, this deck can also consistently make <span><strong>Vanity's Ruler</strong> lockdown</span> plays and Nekroz of Areadbhair serves as an extra support negation to interrupt plays (such as Eldlich, Shaddolls, Burning Abyss...etc).</span>  <span><span>Diviner of the Heralds</span> is an outstanding one card combo - both to start the engine, and for mid-to-late game grinding. The Drytron engine offers amazing recycling and grinding game, and most importantly, allos extra ritual summons while <span><strong>Meteonis Drytron</strong></span> is a generic ritual spell that can also revive ritual monsters from the grave (like <span><strong>Nekroz Cycle</strong></span>). Diviner of the Heralds's versatile play consists on dumping <span><strong>Herald of the Arc Light</strong></span> (for universal ritual card search), while also allowing plays dumping <span><strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong></span> to destroy one essential card on the enemy side of the field (such as floodgates or lockdowns) without needing to special summon or accessing the extra deck. Personally, both effects of Diviner of the Heralds makes it the perfect substitution for Manju, while offering many outplay potential for both first and second turn plays. </span>  <span><span>Nekroz of Areadbhair</span> is the new big monster for the Nekroz archetype - easily accessible, helps unbrick Nekroz hands, can be search through <span><strong>Herald of Arc Light</strong></span> (Any Ritual Monster/Spell), <span><strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong></span> (Any Ritual Monster/Spell), <strong><span>Nekroz of Brionac</span> </strong>(Nekroz Monster), <strong><span>Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz</span> </strong>(Warrior Nekroz Ritual) and <strong><span>Drytron Alpha Thuban</span> </strong>(Ritual Monster). The strongest part about Nekroz of Areadbhair are optional plays to tribute from ""hand or field"" which can trigger tribute effect monsters such as Shurit and Diviner, while also ""banishing the negated monster"" (does not limit to monster effect activated in hand/field/grave). Meanwhile, the deck has passive counter towards extra deck monsters such as <span><strong>Nekroz of Unicore</strong></span> (Extra Deck monster Skill Drain) and <span><strong>Nekroz of Clausolas</strong></span> (Spell Speed 2 negation and ATK reduction to 0). The main card to establish a lead gameplay is summoning and resolving <span><strong>Nekroz of Trishula</strong></span> (Banish 1 Hand / 1 Field / 1 Grave) as it offers minimum a net +2 advantage that can inherently banish essential card on enemy side of the field without targeting.</span>  <span>My <span>all time favorite Nekroz play</span> (going second to break </span><span>board) is starting the turn and entering battle phase directly with nothing on board to shock enemy with <span><strong>Evenly Matched</strong></span> (banish all enemy field and leaving one card on the field), and then following up with a Nekroz of Trishula play to wipe the last card on the enemy board completely while banishing one extra card in the enemy hand. Resolving both effects in the same turn would leave your enemy devastated and force them to scoop immediately. Unfortunately, most decks will have some kind of front row or backrow with spell/trap negation, so the chances of making this power play is extremely difficult. However, this play is significantly easy to make against decks like Eldlich, Burning abyss, Shaddoll...etc.</span>  <span>Overall, I strongly believe Nekroz still remains a strong and competitive deck for 2021. There are many alternative Nekroz builds viable for the meta such as: <span>Deskbot build</span> (vulnerable to handtrap as it relies on a one card combo),  <span>Impcantation build</span>  (slow but consistent) and <span>Dogmatik build</span> (low risk low reward, but consistent).</span>  &nbsp;  If you have any suggestions to improve the deck, please comment down below."

This deck uses Abyss Actors as a chain of Pendulum Summons for Monsters such as <em>Evil Heel </em>through support like <em>Apprentice Piper </em>and <em>Trendy Understudy</em> and with the help of Link Monsters like <em>Hyper Director </em>and <em>Proxy Dragon</em>. The deck also includes good scales in the form of <em>Leading Lady </em>and <em>Twinkle Star</em> to summon lower-level <em>Abyss Actors</em> using the same Link support, and additional scale support in a pinch like <em>Curtain Raiser</em>. Naturally too, the <em>Abyss Script</em> Spells and <em>Abyss Actor</em> Traps are meant to keep the momentum on Monster plays going. Alongside direct support, <em>Ghost Ogre</em>, <em>Solemn Strike</em> and <em>Impermanence </em>are used to slow down opponent counters and negates to the Summons required for this deck.  With the Special Summons provided by the above mentioned, the end-goal is to summon <em>Number 27: Dreadnought Dreadnoid</em>, and through that summon the heavy-hitter and backrow manager, <em>Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destoryer</em>.  This deck is going to undergo a handful of changes"

Its all of the cards of the archetype ran in 2's and 3's, as well as a few extras. The basic gameplay loop is pretty simple. You want as wide as pendulum scale as you can set up, and then you take advantage of the archetypes resilience against effects and traps to push forward and win quickly with high 2000+ power monsters. &lt;!--more--&gt;  <strong>Main Deck Monsters:</strong>  Each of these cards has a purpose besides their ATK and DEF.  <span><strong>Coeuria:</strong> Helps keep monster effects under control. Be aware when using her Quick Effect that she can kill monsters that activate effects, but not negate them. </span>  <span><strong>Beautea: </strong>Has a Quick Effect that makes things get banished instead of hitting the graveyard. This ranges from great to useless, as you can use it to take out annoying that don't stay in the graveyard. <strong>Her second ability</strong> lets her kill a monster at the beginning of the damage step if its ATK is higher than or equal to the lowest pendulum scale x300. (So usually between 300 - 900.) So use her vs 3000+ monsters, and let someone else kill the small stuff. </span>  <span><strong>Angelea:</strong> Use this card to smooth out your board and fish for certain effects. By tributing a ""michord"" monster, you can search out another one with a pendulum scale 2 higher or lower than what you tributed. So for example, this lets you take an 1100 ATK Elitea who has bounced a spell or trap, and turn her into a Cutea for adding a monster to hand and buffing your field, or into a Gracea with 2100 ATK that can add a spell/trap to hand.  <strong>Her second ability</strong> is also good, as it prevents trap/spell activation during the battle phase until <strong>after </strong>the damage step as long as you have an odd pendulum scale. </span>  <span><strong>Gracea</strong>: Adds a ""michord"" spell or trap to the hand, so we don't need terraforming or metaverse in most matches. Target Harmonia if its not out. Target Musica if you need the special summon/destruction, target Elegance/Scale to fix your pendulum scales. <strong>Her second ability</strong> is also good, as it prevents trap/spell activation during the battle phase until <strong>after </strong>the damage step as long as you have an even pendulum scale. </span>  <span><strong>Fancea:</strong> Moves a ""michord"" monster from the deck to the Extra Deck. This is better than it sounds, because of so many abilities that key off manipulating monsters there. <strong>Her second ability </strong>is useful but easily played around. It allows her to be destroyed instead of another ""michord"" during battle. </span>  <span><strong>Elitea: </strong>Bounces a spell/trap when she's summoned. She also prevents battle damage while you have an even scale, so don't be afraid to drop her face up ATK for her effect. </span>  <span><strong>Dreamea: </strong>Can be special summoned if you have a pendulum ""michord"" out.  If a ""michord"" dies from a card effect, she can take its place. </span>  <span><strong>Cutea: </strong>Fishes a ""michord"" monster to your hand when summoned, so she helps regulate pendulum scales. <strong>Her second ability</strong> is also good, giving a buff = to pendulum scale to your ""michord"" monsters. </span>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <hr />  &nbsp;  <strong>Spells and Traps: </strong>  A lot of gameplay is centered around the field spell, as well as the deck searches and pendulum fixes.  <strong>Doremichord Elegance:</strong> Its used to either set up your pendulum scales or draw cards. Don't be afraid to use it to draw cards late game. If you have Doremichord Harmony in play, you can rebuild them easily by using Harmony to add one high or low girl back to the hand, and then reactivate your scales assuming you have at least 1 other usable 'michord' in hand, or Pendulum shift and a suitable target.  <strong>Doremichord Scale:</strong> This card struggles to be useful, but I've kept it because this is a fun deck and I wanted the whole archetype. They are the first things I sideboard out in most cases. It DOES help fix your pendulums if they get screwy, but the 5+ and 7+ are rarely going to happen.  <strong>Doremichord Harmonia:</strong> This is the most important spell, as it does so much for your board. <strong>First,</strong> it gives you your level 1 'michord"" monster back to summon from hand for a free deck add. (Or any other 'michord' you would rather normal summon.) <strong>Second, </strong>it allows you to fix your scales by raising one pendulum to rank 9. This is important for your card effects that proc off of even, odd, or pendulum scales of each. <strong>Third, </strong>as long as you have 3 or more ""michords"" all odd or even, you can destroy a card the other guy has.  These effects can be used in any order, so its entirely possible to to add an odd scaled card to hand, activate it to the pendulum zone, make the other scale a 9, then use the ability to destroy a card. Even better, they are independent activations which means you can eat a negate and still have some of the effects left.  <strong>Pendulum XYZ:</strong> This deck is really good for this card, because each cards scale + level = 9. This means that you'll usually have at least a level 6-9 monster in a given zone. This makes it super easy to summon a big XYZ baddie out of the deck. I picked ones I liked for anti spell/effects/ATK power, but I'm sure there's more competitive options. This card is nice to use if you have an otherwise bricky Doremichord Elegance in hand. Just use this, then activate Elegance and rebuild.  <strong>Doremichord Musica:</strong> It either helps special summon monsters or destroys an opponents card.  <strong>Doremichord Formal:</strong> Protects your pendulum monsters AND your pendulum zones. Make sure you have a face-up monsters in the extra deck to use this. It doesn't actually negate anything, but on the bright side it does respond to spells/traps AND monster effects.  <strong>Pendulum Switch:</strong> Moves cards between being monsters or spells. This is useful when you need them to be one or the other, or when pushing for final damage by turning your low scales (your highest ATK) into monsters again.  <strong>Sanctuary of Parshath:</strong> Odd one off pick, but it gets some of your fairies over the 3k barrier while also protecting traps and allowing to you recycle fairies from the grave after they were used for XYZ stuff or put there by the other player.  <strong>Raigeki/Harpy/Solemn Judgement:</strong> These are all strong one off cards.  Some people don't like these, so by all means you can switch them out.  <hr />  &nbsp;  <strong>Extra Deck: </strong>  These cards are mostly all utility. Change to suit your own tastes.  <strong>Elemental Charmers: </strong>This deck uses all 4 elemental attributes, so putting one of each adds options to both increase pendulum summons and maybe take something good from the graveyard.  <strong>Linkuriboh: </strong>Summon Cutea, search a card, then if her attack buff isn't needed, turn her into a Linkuriboh to soak damage and put Cutea back in your face-up extra pile.  <strong>Celestial Knightlord Parshath:</strong> Use him to fish out Sanctuary of Parsath or a fairy monster from the deck. Also, he's got a GY function to banish a fairy to summon a fairy.  <strong>Heavymetalfoes Electrumite:</strong> Summoning him puts a stock of 3 pendulum monsters face-up in your extra deck. He can also destroy cards to add other cards back to your hand, as well as granting you cards when your pendulum zones are cleared. Without support, he's going to get ran over at only 1800 atk power, so make sure you get the most out of his abilities.  <strong>Zefra Metaltron:</strong> Also helps get pendulum monsters back out of the GY in addition to helping control the opponents board and reset nerfed cards.  <strong>Number 89:</strong> Good ATK and able to banish a card from your opponents extra deck.  <strong>Number 24:</strong> Decent control card and okay ATK.  <strong>Spriggun Ship Exblower:</strong> Good defense and able to clear a mix of monsters/backrow.  <strong>Number 11:</strong> Good ATK. Yoinks a monster permanently.  <strong>Number 76:</strong> Good ATK. At formation its going to be battle-immune to two elements, and you can add elements to this number. Also, she has a keyboard sword for lolz.  <strong>Dark Anthelion Dragon:</strong> Strong ATK. Also has some recursion abilities after it dies, and is a useful pendulum that halves enemy ATK.  <strong>Number 38:</strong> Strong ATK, and can negate spell effects.  <hr />  <strong>Sideboard: </strong>  Cards to help against certain types of situations.  <strong>Beutea, Dreamea and Elitea:</strong>  1 more of each of these in case you are playing card effect or recursion heavy enemies. Swap out a Coeuria or a Fancea to make room.  <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>: I put this in the side to add in if someone is playing a deck that hinges on combo searches.  <strong>Pendulum Halt:</strong> If I find myself constantly losing battles or with a ton of dead 'michords', I side this in and remove Scale.  <strong>Typhoon:</strong> I put this card in against Spell Mining Cave or Floodgate decks.  <strong>Mask of Restrict</strong>: Helps stop Monarchs and Kaiju, as well as a number of other effects.  <strong>Pendulum Reborn</strong>: If someone is milling my fairies to the graveyard, this helps get them back.  &nbsp;  <hr />  Final Thoughts:  This deck is probably a B tier deck all said and done. It has some neat tricks, but against someone who is trying to negate your summons, its all wasted. Its fun to play and can usually recover from a board wipe mid game with enough assets in hand. Its hard to get scale-bricked, unless you only draw low scales, but there's a few fixer cards in place to help with that. And even if you do say, draw nothing but Level 8, Scale 1 cards, you can just Pendulum XYZ them into something useful to help get yourself back on top.  Decks that banish will give this trouble, like any bad pendulum matchup. Decks that rely on traps and backrow should be a favorable game. It has a few strange things I've done, and things that can be improved I'm sure, but that's probably because I'm a filthy casual and don't know everything there is to know about the Yugi meta."

Here's a redo, i guess. Shame people are buying out Prankids cards; i'd love to build them IRL. How's the wife? Note that I talk about all the Prankkids without mentioning their conditions for their summoning effs. so count in the condition that they have to be sent to the grave for a fusion or link summon of a Prank kid monster first if you read this. you probably wont. wait, who are you? oh god, i thought i already paid my rent this month.  3x Rocksies- Rocksies is one of the usual combo pieces for Prankids, as all the children are. Rocksies is a nice card for garnering advantange, as it allows you to plus 1 i'm pretty sure, with drawing you one and specialling a Prankkid from deck at the cost of banishing a card. Why is he made of rocks? What's happened to him? 3x Lampsies- Lampsies is underwhelming- it goes hand neutral, as the most it does is burn the opponent for an unimportant amount of damage and get some bodies on board. He looks like he's in intense pain from that fire. Someone please put him out. 3x Dropsies- the aftermath of a failed waterboarding, Dropsies LP gaining is worthless and does nothing for the deck. Like the rest, it SS's from deck for field presence. 3x Fansies- Fansies is really nice for setting up the grave for extended plays, and also, as can be assumed, gets more bodies on board from deck. God, i'm going to deck out at this rate. Also, Fansies looks like his body is falling apart and he's panicking. Somebody help him. 3x Aleister- Aleister is a favorite card of mine- he has really cool lore, both in and outside of the yu gi oh universe. Anyway, Aleister is the deck's main normal summon if you open him, as he gets you to Invocation to most likely go into Mechaba. Just play Mechaba. 3x Ash- Chain Ash Chain Gamma Chain Gamma Chain TTT Chain Solemn Strike Chain Solemn Judgement Call a judge 3x Ghost Belle- cries in lunalight 3x Pranks- Pranks really helps with getting bodies on board for plays, as Pranks loads up your grave and gives you a token for that advantage as well, which is very appreciated. It's second effect is an archetypal Jar of Avarice for prank kids,  allowing you to recycle resources during the end phase and get advantage for turn 2. 3x Place- Place is a pretty average field spell, as on activation, it's a ROTA for the deck, which is, you know. Really fucking good. It also gives you a pretty unimportant attack boost when you fusion summon a Prankids fusion, which isn't important and not very useful. It has a ""yin"" effect, where if you link summon a Prankids, all monsters your opponent controls loses 500- in a going first deck. 2x Pandemonium- Pandemonium is the archetypal fusion spell, and, at first glance, is pretty great. The main problem is that it locks you into Prankids for the rest of the turn after you activate it, which is a pain in the ass. Due to that, I run it it at 2- some people run it at 1, and utter fucking imbeciles play it at 3. It's a quick play, so you can set it for interruption, which is nice. 2x Invocation- Normal summon Aleister Declare Aleister Tops YCS 1x Terraforming- Terraforming is a nice tool for consistency, as if you've already opened Place, you can use it to search Recycing PLant (which i'll get into in a bit), and vica versa, etc. It's a nice tool for consistency and does it's job well for getting your ROTAs to hand. 1x Instant Fusion- Instant Fusion is a great play starter, as it gets out a lower leveled Prank Kids fusion for free, getting bodies on board to start plays. You can also use it to summon Raidjin when goign second, to help with breaking boards and forcing out negates. 2x Fusion Recycling Plant- I said we'd get to it. Plant's generally a nice card for getting Poly to your hand, as Poly is th eother fusion spell to avoid using Pandomnium, due to Pandomenium's restrictions. Recycling Plant also helps with, well, reyccling fusion material monsters to extend your plays and set up plays for turn 2. 2x poly- oh god 3x Desires- banish Invocation, Instant, Terra, and all the prankids smile 2x Battle Butler- Battle Butler is a quick play Raigeki that, at first sight, leaves you with only a Mechaba  (on the ideal board). Using Meow Meow Mu (which i'll get into later), Butler doesn't even tribute itself, meaning you can have multiple large bodies on board and quick play Raigeki the opponent for barely any cost. It also just, gets bodies back on board hwen it dies, although it probably won't be dying. 1x Rocket Ride- Instant fusion go brrrrrr Rocket Ride is mainly used for extending plays, as you can sack it off to summon two prankids from your grave, turning 1 monster into two. That's, y'know, really good. 1x Weather Washer- I play this purely to fuck over that one guy at my locals who mains Mirror Force in every god damn deck he plays Fuck you Dillan 1x Augo- Prob won't be summonig this lol. It's just nice for clearing boards and doing funny shit. 1x Mechaba- The invoked monster you will be summoning, Mechaba is a nice negation monster. it loads up your grave for later, and negate's the opponent's combo pieces, as long as you know what you're doing. 1x Raidjin- Book of Moon on legs is pretty nice. 1x Caliga- Floodgate go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 1x Rooster- Similar to Butler, Rooster is a quick play Harpie's Duster, by tributing itself. Using Meow Mu, you can avoid the tributing itself, allowing you to fucking wreck backrow decks for little to no cost. On death, it recycles non-link monsters from grave back to the hand for other plays. 1x Bark- Bark allows you to recur resources at the same time as giving your Prankids protection during the opponent's turn, all of which is really nice on a quick effect. He also gives a small and unimportant damage boost. 1x Doodle Doo- Doodle Doo allows you to search Prank Kids S/T, giving you access to Place and such, extending your plays greatly. Additionally, it allows you to tribute itself to bounce Prankids back to your hand, although this eff isnt a quick effect. 2x Meow Meow Mu- Meow Meow is an integral card to the deck, due to it's GY effect. Whenever a Prank Kids would tribute itself for an effect, you could banish Meow Meow instead, allowing you to keep your board in tact and still blow up the opponent's. Meow Meow is an amazing link-1 for the deck you want to bump to the grave as soon as possible. 1x Artemis- Artemis is just a link-1 for Aleister, as you link off Aleister into Artemis for an instant Mechaba after normal summoning Aleister.

Does not incorporate the Metalfoes Fusion monsters.,"This build of Unchained is more on the Control side, but it still has the potential to switch into a break your board otk deck if needed to. The inclusion of Metalfoes Vanisher really helps out this deck because it can out monsters that destruction effects can't, as well as having the option to banish a monster from the grave.  So this strategy, as you can see, has all the Unchained good stuff you can expect from the archetype, but now with a small metalfoes package of Silverd, Vanisher, and Counter. With the inclusion of painful decision, this deck gives you a consistent way to pop your unchained cards with the benefit of tutoring out Metalfoes Counter of which can lead to a disruption using Vanisher.  Using Silverd can act as an extender to this deck because if an Unchained monster on board would have their effect negated with impermanence or ash blossom, then you can pop the monster and still be able to play the game.  Also it's important to note that I'm not running any of the Metalfoes Fusion cards mainly because that means you need to have a metalfoes monster on board if you were to run Super-Poly. I'm not leaning too hard into Metalfoes, so there was no reason to put in the whole Super-Poly and Metalfoes Fusion cards package that people expect from Metalfoes.  Lastly, I have 7 handtraps in this deck, not including driver, and using this many handtraps definitely muddies the consistency of the deck, so you can feel free to change up the ratio of handtraps by adding in another Sarama or maybe even the Wailing of the Unchained if you wish to run that card.  This is my first time uploading a deck and this build is probably going to change over time, but I think it's a decent build right now. Thanks for reading."

I thought Supreme Arc V was cool and wanted to try and make a way to make him casually,"Try to get as many of the dragon magicians in the graveyard as possible, use star pendulumgraph and Timestar Magician to help search each magician out  When you have black fang, purple poison, white wing, and either double iris or an odd eyes card in your hand, field, or graveyard use chronographs ability to fusion summon Supreme King Z-Arc to wipe their field and hit them with direct attacks  Supreme Rage would also be helpful when you summon Z-Arc in order to special summon Supreme king odd eyes, Supreme clear wing, and Supreme king dark rebellion to make sure to finish them that round.  Tips-  Purple poisons destruction effect can be used to pop monsters if their field  Xiangke and Xiangsheng can get out Odd eyes rebellion dragon to destroy all face up monsters your opponent controls for 1000 lp each and then attack 3 times with 3000 atk  White wing magician with any level 4 will also easily get you out Supreme King Clear Wing, a powerful synchro monster.  Odd eyes fusion can be used on an empty field for odd eyes vortex dragon to send a monster they control to the hand and negate spell/trap effects  Utopia the lightning is always a powerful option to take down opponent boss monsters as well  Also using fusion cards on magicians will help send them to the grave directly  Pendulum call is a great way to discard a magician and add 2 more to your hand  Timestar Magician can search out Chronograph Sorcerer as well as send magicians straight from deck to graveyard"

That's the closest to meta I'm ever going to get, so I'm going to move on.  More or less this deck is a gimmick-y <em>Odd-Eyes/Performapal/Magician</em> deck, with certain focuses.  <em>Odd-Eyes Dissolver</em> is a key card in summoning heavy-hitters alongside <em>Dragoon</em>, like <em>Rune-Eyes</em> and <em>Vortex Dragon</em>. It also works well to help preserve a board in a pinch. XYZ-wise, the number of Level 7 Monsters in the deck help bring out <em>Absolute Dragon</em>, which is a good Extra Deck beater to help recycle <em>Odd-Eyes</em> Monsters that get popped. The other two XYZ, <em>Ebon Illusionist </em>and <em>Number 67, </em>are more or less for more gimmick-y plays, either using Dark Magician as something more that a material for Dragoon and just rolling dice for grins.  Spells and Traps don't need much explanation because most, if not all, of them center around supporting or summoning <em>Odd-Eyes </em>Monsters or just serving to support the Pendulum-heavy nature of the deck."

With Lightning Overdrive coming in the near horizon with big Rose Dragon support, I was wondering if there was any way to bring a new type of Dragon Link to the TCG. That is when I created an update version of the Rokket engine that, from playtesting, seems more consistent.  Here is how the easiest combo is played:  White Rose Dragon normal summon, trigger it's effect to special summon a rose dragon from your hand, I like to go with Red Rose Dragon. Link off into Halq, and trigger its effect to special Roxrose Dragon. You should have a spell card that either triggers a special summon from the graveyard, or, use chaos space to summon Wyverburster or Collarserpent. Link Roxrose off into Elpy and Wyver/Collar into Pisty. Trigger Wyver/Collar's effect to get the other one in your hand. Trigger Elpy's effect to special Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Link Elpy, Pisty, and Halq off into Borrelsword. Banish Wyver/Collar to special summon the other to the field. Banish Chaos Space to Draw a card. Trigger Red-Eyes' effect to special summon Red Rose Dragon from the graveyard. Synchro off one of the chaos dragon babies and Red Rose into Black Rose Dragon. Do not trigger BRD's effect. Trigger Red Rose's effect to special Roxrose Dragon and activate it's effect to search a Basal Rose Shoot from your deck. Synchro summon Blood Rose Dragon using Black Rose Dragon and Roxrose Dragon. On that summon, quick-play Basal Rose Shoot to instantly get the Black Rose Dragon back.  Your ending board will be: Borrelsword Dragon, Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon, Blood Rose Dragon, and Black Rose Dragon.  It will all pretty much end up being that ending board, you may just have different routes like Chamber Dragonmaid/White Rose Cloister.  I would be happy to go into more depth if anyone has any questions.  Thanks!  -Al."

From there, Fusion Monsters summoned through these cards could be used to extend into stronger fusions, such as <em>Oblivion King Caesar </em>and <em>Super Doom King Purple.</em> Otherwise, <em>Divine Zero King Rage</em> and <em>Sinister Yorishiro</em> work well to bring out higher-level Monsters in the deck, such as <em>Savant Galilei </em>and <em>Proud Ogre</em> to transition into Link or XYZ plays to strengthen the board in a pinch.  The remaining Spells/Traps work towards advancing the board, however suffer from the obvious drawback of a 1000 Life Point cost each Standby Phase. <em>Solemn Judgment</em> works well as preventing negation of the various <em>Contract</em> cards and the various scattered support included."
