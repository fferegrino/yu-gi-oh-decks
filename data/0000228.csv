Use this if you really like summoning a lot of HERO monsters and fast!,"The entire purpose of this deck is to swarm the field with as many HERO cards as you can. With this deck you should constantly work to take down your opponent in a move or two. If you wait much longer it can get a little bit dicey with the lack of negates, I put in this deck. The Mirror Force I have in the deck is incredibly flexible as well. I'm just old fashioned and like the classic Mirror Force card but those two card slots are very easily replaced with whatever you want in the deck. As far as the monsters go, I'm still not entirely sold on Destiny HERO Dogma but he's a nice option to combo with Destiny HERO Dystopia when using Fusion Destiny. You could also easily go with less Destiny HERO Drawhand's as well. I just like the extra cards and typically your opponent shouldn't be around long enough for them getting extra cards to matter too much.

As far as general strategy with this deck I recommend rushing out Masked HERO Dark Law when you go first and a second fusion HERO. If you go second go immediately for the OTK. Bring out Malicious Bane who can clear out all faceup monsters on your opponent's side of the field with less attack them him. Then bring out Elemental HERO Sunrise to boost all your monsters ATK and get you a free Miracle Fusion from your deck. Then you can use that Miracle Fusion to bring out one of your other Elemental HERO fusion monsters.

You can also go into the OP strategy with the Vision HERO's. All you need is Vision HERO Faris in your hand and any other monster. You can tribute the other monster from your hand to Special Summon Vision HERO Faris. With his effect you bring Vision HERO Increase to your spell/trap card zone from your deck. Then activate the effect of Vision HERO Increase to tribute a faceup monster (Likely and usually Vision HERO Faris) to special summon Vision HERO Vyon. Then use Elemental HERO Vyon's effect to send a HERO monster to the graveyard. (I prefer to use this effect on an Elemental HERO Shadow Mist unless I gave him up from my hand to summon Vison HERO Faris in the first place. If that's the case Destiny HERO Drawhand, Vision HERO Increase or Destiny HERO Dynatag work good as well.) Once Elemental HERO Shadow Mist is sent to the graveyard you can use his effect to add any HERO monster you want to your hand. I use this effect to add Evil HERO Adusted Gold. Then from the field I use Vision HERO Vyon's other effect to remove from play a HERO monster from my graveyard to add a Polymerization to my hand. I usually will remove from play Elemental HERO Shadow Mist. Next, I activate the effect of Evil HERO Adusted Gold to add Dark Calling to my hand from the deck. You can then use Dark Calling to fuse Vision HERO Faris with Evil HERO Adusted Gold to summon Evil Hero Malicious Bane. From there you can use the polymerization to summon another fusion monster or use some of the other cards from your hand to support some other fusion summons and you are typically in a pretty good spot to get a first turn OTK.

In a pinch you can also always use the classic board wipe combo by Fusion summing Elemental HERO Absolute Zero and using Mask Change on him to summon Masked HERO Acid. Together they wipe your opponent's entire field.

There are many other combo's that can be done with this deck as well but aren't as consistent. Fusion Destiny to bring out Destiny HERO Dystopia is always a nice play. You can also mess around a bit with the XTRA HERO's I added in this deck if link summoning is your thing. If you're not a big fan of link summoning, you could always replace them with some more Masked HERO or Omni HERO options. Also, Super Polymerization can be a nice way to remove an opponent's boss monster from the field granted only if they are Light, Dark or Water. This is where adding more of the Omni Hero's can be pretty beneficial.

Moreso than anything, just have fun using this deck to summon tons of cool HERO cards.!"

Keep gy as full of machina as possible ready to summon ruinforce! Build your board with the following combos:
<ul>
 	<li>Gearframe-unclaspare (super useful for xyz summons);</li>
 	<li>air raide-citadel (dicard the second to sp summon the first thx to its effect, activate te effect of the first sp summon what u need and sp summon citadel for its effect);</li>
 	<li>irradiator-megaform (one of the most important combos! sp summon the first discarding the second thx to his effect, use the first's effect to summon the second from gy, tribute the second thx to its effects to sp summon what u need. Careful this cambos has unlimited possibilities use ur immagination to win the game with it!!! You can summon citadel, unclasper to activate his effect sand to gy ruinforce and sp summon it from gy banishing irradiator and megaforce or anything else and more. tip: only if u can try not to use megaform for ruinforce's sp summon couse it could be useful to keep it in the gy because of its secondary effect if u have a fortress on your field.);</li>
 	<li>flying pegasus allows you to ez summon xyz;</li>
 	<li>possesstorage can be used for xyz as pegasus but it has the addictional effect of making cards go back to owner's hands (you can create cool combos with it and unclaspare: sp summon from gy then u make unclaspare come back to ur hand to make come back an opponent's spell/trap to his hand and then special summon again unclaspare for its effect and keep going with ruiforce.);</li>

So instead add Melffys and drown in resources!

Main strategy here is to use the bears for what they should be used for: handtraps and synchro summoning. High level bears + a Melffy is a free Baronne (aka Synchro Dragoon) on board. If you're in a pinch, Rescue Cat can turbo out the materials you need to summon Halqifibrax and synchro on your opponents turn. Obedience can get you a Joyous Melffy on board for disruption plays in case you draw bad. Anything is better than nothing, which is what the bears alone leave you with. Ideally you open Radiation and just go nuts on summoning bears to keep adding cards to your hands.

Also the level 10 Swordsoul Synchro works amazingly well with the deck. With Big Dipper on the board, you can banish bears from the graveyard to summon from hand. This means you can use the big bears for their hand trap functions, and banishing to summon them lets you banish from your opponents field and graveyard with your Swordsoul!"

Normal summoning and banishing are the bread and butter of this deck, so use it well. All the low levels birds are banished when they leave the field and return to your hand on a successful summon of another Winged-Beast monster.

&nbsp;

Ideal opening hand here is Nadir + Robina. Activate Nadir, send your choice of ED monster (varies on need) and add Ecclesia. Normal summon Robina, search and summon Eaglen. Search Empen off of Eaglen and normal summon. Add Map or Unknown Winds (if you opened map) and normal summon Ecclesia off of Empen. Search Punishment, set and pass. Map gives you a summon of their normal summon, giving you the chance to summon birds and turbo out whatever monster you need. Notable monsters here are Raiza to remove your opponents board and Apex Avian for a free negate."

Many lists were either running a large HERO package complete with Stratos, Malicious, and D-Draw or a heavier zombie package that made use of Pyramid Turtle and Mystic Tomato as extra floaters. This list includes the remnants of Tele-DAD combined with all the zombie goodness. In my opinion, D-Draw is just to gimmicky to run even with Stratos. Nearly every monster in this deck is a dark, so Allure of Darkness is great for draw power. Double Foolish Burial (can you believe this card was ever not limited) lets us dump anything to the graveyard, but Mezuki is usually the choice since it can not be sent off of Arma Knight or Dark Grepher. Speaking of Arma Knight and Dark Grepher, they let us get Malicious out of the deck early to prevent a dead draw later. Reinforcement of the Army is included for obvious reasons. Some dark good stuff rounds out the monsters. Notably, I am not including Pyramid Turtle or Mystic Tomato. My reason for doing so is that there are so many ways in the format to get rid of face down monsters without destroying them by battle. 2009-2010 is the absolute heyday for zombie decks, so grab a friend to play retro formats and enjoy the list!"

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.

""Despia"" (デスピア Desupia) is an archetype of DARK Fairy and LIGHT Fiend monsters introduced in Dawn of Majesty. ""Despia""/""Despian"" is a combination of the words ""despair"", ""death"", and ""thespian"". The names of ""Despia"" cards stems from theatrical elements and drama. The theatrical theme of the ""Despia"" archetype is fitting, as these monsters kept up the facade of a holy Church for a long time, as if they were playing a theatrical fiction, before revealing their true colors.

Albaz Dragon is a series of Level 8 DARK or LIGHT Fusion Monsters that specifically list ""Fallen of Albaz"" as a Fusion Material. They share a similar naming scheme, and the majority of them have 2500 ATK and 2000 DEF. Despite their names and appearances, not all members are Dragon-Type. The series is indirectly supported by the ""Branded"" archetype.

this deck plays its brick like Swordsouls Allies that is only good as a branded fusion target so you can use its grave effect.

Kitt and Branded Fusion are the MVP of the deck and a must of 3x.

Albion helps you out of brick hands but i believe in a 3x it's tuo heavy.

Gold Sarc is good because you can banish Mercourier, which will add Kitt, who Will add Branded fusion.

I was thinking about siding the 2 D. Barrier for one Fusion Gate and a fusion substitute to help in case of a albaz + brick in hand.

I'd like to hear your opinion on this one in a comment and feed back are always welcomed."

Grind out your opponent while you maintain car","“Ancient Earth Machine” harnesses the full might of the Military Industrial Complex to turbo out monstrous mechas like Dingirsu, Rail Cannon Liebe, Divine Arsenal Zeus, Machina Ruinforce, and best of all - Ancient Gear Chaos Giant!

Functioning as a grindy aggro-beatdown deck, Ancient Earth Machine’s gameplan is to wear down your opponent’s resources while you maintain card advantage – <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/nxAD2vk"">preparing an ideal gamestate where you can certainly OTK</a>. Ancient Earth Machine is designed as a “turn 3 deck.” Creating an ideal board turn 1, defending/interrupting opponent turn 2, then OTKing turn 3.

Going first, this deck seeks to blow up your opponent’s entire board with <a data-name=""Machina Citadel"">Machina Citadel</a>’s field-wipe and create an nigh-unbreakable wall with an unaffected 4000 DEF Rail Cannon Super Dora. Hand advantage and resources are maintained with Urgent Schedule, Revolving Switchyard and by resolving Ancient Gear Box/Super Express Bullet Train multiple times.

On the play, his deck can easily generate enough lethal firepower to obliterate your opponent’s life points several times over by summoning several machine boss monsters on the field often playing through handtraps/interruption due to it's sheer resource advantage. Nothing much can withstand the assault of the likes of Ancient Gear Chaos Giant, Machina Ruinforce, and Rail Cannon Liebe! If your opponent manages to survive, Dingirsu or Liebe can make a 4 material Zeus, enough for two fieldwipes!

&nbsp;
<p><span><strong>ARCHETYPES AND RATIOS</strong></span></p>
<strong> </strong>

I describe this deck as a “Military Industrial Complex” because its 4 archetypes are designed for maximum firepower and peak productivity. Also, this deck is fairly complex to pilot!

<strong>The Military</strong>

Ancient Gear forms the main offensive force of this army, with all it’s units eventually coalescing into the general, Chaos Giant, obliterating everything in it’s path. It is very compact compared to other standard Ancient Gear decks, but it consistently accomplishes it’s job of turboing out Ancient Gear Chaos Giant. <em>It is composed of 1 Wyvern, 2 Frame, 2 Box, 1 Fusion, and 1 GearTown. In the Extra Deck there are 2 Ballista, 1 Ultimate Golem, 1 Megaton Golem and 1 Chaos Giant.</em>

Machina are the legions of soldiers that compose this army, eroding the enemy in defensive attrition-based warfare. Enabling battle operations with Redeployment, Gearframe, and Unclaspare – Citadel and Fortress thin out enemy forces before finishing them off with Ruinforce<em>. It is composed of 1 Ruinforce, 1 Citadel, 1 Fortress, 2 Unclaspare, 3 Gearframe, 3 Redeployment, and 3 Overdrive. </em>

<strong>The Industry</strong>

Trains supply the war machine with ammunitions and resources from behind the lines through it’s extensive network via Revolving Switchyard. Super Express Bullet Train’s salvage operations recycle dead metal into brand new war machines while Urgent Schedule rushes units to the frontline. Superdreadnought-class Rail Cannons “Liebe” and “Dora” provide cover through their fearsome artillery barrage. <em>It is composed of 2 Super Express Bullet Train, 1 Infinitrack Tunneller, 3 Revolving Switchyard, 1 Terraforming, and 3 Urgent Schedule. In the Extra deck there is Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora and Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe.</em>

<strong>The Complex</strong>

Sky Striker is a special ops unit piloted by a single girl. She supports the army by extending supply lines and through pinpoint threat removal. Engage! add Hornet Drones, which can lead to Zeke (targeted banish of monster), Knightmare Phoenix (backrow destruction) and Kaina (Earth Machine Extender). <em>It is composed of 1 Engage! and Hornet Drones. In the Extra Deck there is Sky Striker Ace - Kagari, Sky Striker Ace - Kaina, Sky Striker Ace - Zeke, and Knightmare Phoenix.</em>

AA-Zeus is the most skilled pilot in the army, piloting one of the most potent mechas ever created. Capable of decimating entire regions, vast armies have been annihilated by Zeus’ overwhelming firepower and speed. AA-Zeus can be deployed by any XYZ, but it prefers to be summoned by it’s predecessors Liebe and Dingirsu so it has the maximum amount of XYZ materials (usually 4) to repeatedly wipe the field clean. In the maindeck it<em> is composed of 1 Infinitrack Anchor Drill. In the Extra Deck it is composed of 1 Dingirsu the Orcust of the Evening Star, 1 Number 84: Pain Gainer, and 1 Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS – Sky Thunder.</em>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p>
<strong> </strong>

Ancient Earth Machine’s combos are non-linear and are largely hand-dependent. <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/763HxLb"">The quality of your hand determines the resilience and power of your first turn board.</a> Turn 1 boards greatly vary as a result, but ideally the field has a Rail Cannon Super Dora, any other machine monster, a set Machina Overdrive and Machina Citadel in the GY.

<strong> <u>Going first (Turn 1),</u></strong> this deck seeks to gather as much resources as possible while setting up the GY and field. Ideally, a fieldwipe with Machina Citadel is also set-up via sending the monster to the GY and/or setting Machina Overdrive.

This is this deck’s main combo if Machina Gearframe, Revolving Switchyard and any extender are in your first turn hand:
<ol>
 	<li>Activate Revolving Switchyard.</li>
 	<li>Normal summon Machina Gearframe. Gearframe searches Machina Unclaspare.</li>
 	<li>Machina Unclaspare summons itself, and it sends from deck to GY Machina Citadel.</li>
 	<li>XYZ summon Gear Gigant X. Detach from Gear Gigant X to search for Ancient Gear Box. Ancient Gear box searches Anchor Drill/Ancient Gear Frame.</li>
 	<li>Summon extender from hand. (Machina Fortress/Sky Striker Ace – Kaina and Super Express Bullet Train.)</li>
 	<li><u>If Machina Fortress/Sky Striker Ace - Kaina was summoned:</u> Link away both Gear Gigant X/Extender for Double Headed Anger Knuckle. Use Double Anger Knuckle to summon Machina Citadel from GY. The level 10 Earth Machine summoned will trigger Revolving Switchyard’s effect, which will get you Rail Cannon Super Dora.</li>
 	<li><u>If Super Express Bullet Train was summoned:</u> The level 10 Earth Machine summoned will trigger Revolving Switchyard’s effect, which will get you Rail Cannon Super Dora. Detach Super Express Bullet Train from Dora to get it’s end turn effect to recover a machine from your GY.</li>
 	<li>Set your other cards like Urgent Schedule, Machina Overdrive, and Impermanence.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong><u>With this first turn board (Turn 2),</u></strong> you have an near-invincible monster (Super Dora), a potential fieldwipe with Machina Citadel and 2-3 extra cards in hand from resolving Ancient Gear Box and Super Express Bullet Train.

<u> If you control a set Machina Overdrive</u>, you can use it to summon Citadel from your GY or deck so you don’t have to wait for your opponent to trigger its summon for you. From there, fieldwipe your opponent with Citadel at the most optimal timing when it hurts them the most. Summoning Citadel also triggers Revolving Switchyard's summon from deck effect. Machina Overdrive can also get you an additional +1 draw later.

<u>If you control a set Urgent Schedule</u> and a Revolving Switchyard, you can flood the field with three monster cards that all float and net you additional resources.

Try to summon and send Super Express Bullet Train (It is an ideal target to destroy with Citadel) to the GY again this turn. It can retrigger the effects of Ancient Gear Box during the endphase, granting you more resources from deck!

&nbsp;

The following turn, <strong>(Turn 3), </strong>assuming your GY was set up last turn and you gathered enough resources by resolving Revolving Switchyard, Ancient Gear Box, Super Express Bullet Train and Machina Overdrive as much as possible,<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/nxAD2vk""> you should have enough resources to break your opponent’s board and OTK.</a> Overlay Liebe on Super Dora, summon Machina Ruinforce from GY, fusion summon Ancient Gear Chaos Giant and more!

&nbsp;

The threats on your opponent’s board will determine your next course of action.

&nbsp;

<u>If you want to wipe the field with Zeus</u>, Zeus can be made with Super Dora -&gt; Liebe. Also, if you have Infinitrack Anchor Drill + another earth machine you can make a 4 material Zeus. Use Anchor Drill’s effect + another level 4 to make Dingirsu. Attack with Dingirsu, overlay it with Number 84: Pain Gainer -&gt; 4 material Zeus which can wipe the field twice. If you can’t go for the OTK yet, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/RjbjNX0"">Zeus is a great way to equalize the board so you can go for the kill next turn.</a>

&nbsp;

<u></u><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/XRlQtpT""><u>If you want to wipe the field of your opponent’s monsters with Machina Citadel,</u></a> it can easily be summoned by destroying your earth machine monster (usually by crashing it into a stronger monster during battle phase). While it can destroy every monster under 3000 if it destroys itself with its effect, it can destroy Machina Ruinforce to destroy everything under 4600!

<u>If you want to grind out your opponent's resources on board</u>, try to get Machina Citadel and Machina Fortress in rotation (In the GY and field). These two machines form a very strong tag team. If one gets destroyed, they summon each other, while wearing picking apart or blowing up your opponent's board.

<u>If you are certain you can go for the kill,</u> it can be easily done by summoning Ancient Gear Ballista. It’s main goal is to gather the resources needed to summon Ancient Gear Chaos Giant, and to bring your opponent’s monster’s ATK/DEF to 0. Ballista destroys Geartown with it’s effect and Geartown summons from deck Ancient Gear Wyvern so it can search Ancient Gear Fusion. Given the right conditions, Chaos Giant alone is usually enough to OTK your opponent.

&nbsp;

<u>If you know the opponent is going to disrupt your plays,</u> keep Super Dora on the field to provide extra protection. It will make sure any monster is unaffected by card effect if anything tries to negate/banish/destroy/etc. ensuring your plays get through! Liebe can be overlayed on Dora anytime to offer extra firepower afterward and a potential 2 material Zeus.

&nbsp;

<u>If you know your opponent is going to destroy your card(s),</u> make Dingirsu before going for your main play because it can protect any card from destruction with it’s effect. Use Anchor Drill’s effect + another level 4 to make Dingirsu. This card has an added bonus of sending a worrying card from your opponent’s field like backrow threats or a problematic monster.

&nbsp;
<p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>If you want to cut cards from this deck, you can do away with most of the Ancient Gear package (2 Frame, 1 Wyvern, 1 GearTown, 1 Fusion and all 3 fusions in the Extra Deck). Ancient Gear Chaos Giant is my personal ace card, and I placed it in this deck largely from my own bias. They can be replaced with staples, handtraps, or trap cards to make it similar to Pak’s LCS topping Machina list.</li>
 	<li>The key to this deck is patience and timing. If you feel you can’t OTK your opponent, try to conserve your resources (keep your cards in hand and don’t banish from GY yet) until you’re sure you can deliver the finishing blow. While this deck has decent recovery options (Gear Box, Express Bullet Train, Revolving Switchyard), maintaining superior card advantage and depleting your opponent’s board with constant field wipes (Zeus/Citadel) is where it’s strength truly shines. When your opponent is weak and helpless, that’s when you summon your machine army en-masse!</li>
 	<li>This deck discards a lot through it’s use of Revolving Switchyard, Machina Redeployment, Ancient Gear Frame and Double Handed Anger Knuckle. The best cards to discard are Machinas (Ruinforce, Citadel, Fortress, Overdrive, etc.), since they have so much utility in the GY. Discarding Super Express Bullet Train is very good, since it fulfills it’s recovery effect during the endphase if sent to the GY. Discarding spent Sky Striker cards are useful as well, since they usually are used once a duel. Discarding Infinitrack Anchor Drill is great as well, since its recycling effect in the GY is usually live with how much this deck goes through it's Earth Machines.</li>
 	<li>Ancient Earth Machine sometimes dies to a well-timed handtrap/disruption. Common handtraps like Droll, Nibiru and Dimension Shifter can stop you cold mid-combo. An Ash Blossom or Impermanence on your starter can end your turn if you didn’t open an extender. Called by the Grave and DD Crow (normally reserved for Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer). banish your set-up GY monsters (Citadel and Ruinforce). This deck is only a rogue contender but can steal wins away from real meta threats.</li>
 	<li>This deck has a hard time vs. backrow, especially floodgates like TCBOO and Zombie World. Side in backrow hate in matchups where these are common!</li>
 	<li>Floodgate traps like Rivalry of Warlords, Skill Drain and Imperial Order work pretty well with this deck when used properly. Consider using them to choke out your opponent while you play unhindered.</li>
 	<li>Since this deck is highly dependent on resolving your starter, always try to lead with cards that bait out handtraps like Engage! or Revolving Switchyard. Once you lured out their ash, you can go for combo as normal.</li>
 	<li>If the game goes the distance and many of your starters, combo pieces and key cards are in the GY and Banished Pile, Infinitrack Tunneller (Searchable via Ancient Gear Box) and Machina Overdrive (Searchable via Machina Redeployment) can recycle your spent machine cards. Remember if you can't OTK your opponent, out resource them with your superior grindgame!</li>

<p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p>
&nbsp;

Inspired by <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/machina-17/"">Kyle Galliw’s Machina</a> list and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/earth-machine-dozer-control-budget-original-by-aerosol_tcg/"">Aerosol_TCG’s Earth Machine</a> deck, I sought to create the perfect framework to turbo out my beloved ace monster, Chaos Giant and to make Ancient Gears as competitive as possible. This resulted in the creation of this monstrous machine mishmash (I think I’ve largely succeded)! This deck still dies to handtraps, has a difficult time dealing with established meta boards, and keels over to strong floodgates, but is it ever potent!

My favourite Yugioh cards as a child were machines like Machine King, Mechanical Chaser and Roulette Barrel. When I returned to Yugioh back at 2017 I purchased a copy of the “Machine Reactor” structure deck, and ever since then I’ve always been an Ancient Gear/machine-focused duelist at heart.

An example is the two TTT for the mind control or the two Lady Debug for the circles.

Many people like to play with several cyberse links in the extra because of the AsceCode Talker, which I don't see as necessary since it can be done easily without taking up much space on the extra deck.

In this way we can leave a much more varied and solid main and extra.

","Using Branded Fusion combo you can easily summon Dragoon or Winda, but did you know you can summon Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon too? And Tyrant open a window for trap cards!

Even as Tyrant and Dragoon share the same material(hex-sealed fusion), you can still use them two in the same game because of Rubellion the Divineflame Dragon recycling effects.

You can trade these psy-frames for some Dogmatika, more traps or maybe Dinoruffia... I think this is going to be the next deck.

The Tank class of Duel Monsters, a true weapon hoarder","<span>Let's take a moment to talk about your standard Action-RPG. Most games of this type will have 4-5 basic classes, Mage, Ranger, Summoner, Cleric, and Tank, things of that sort. If this card game were an Action-RPG, this would be the Tank class, no doubt. It hits hard, and doesn't rely on gimmicks or magic to get the job done. Just weapons. Lots and lots of weapons.</span>

<span>This deck is all about brute force, increased by the power of an absurd amount of Equip Spells. It's like when your character picks up a whole backpack of weapons just because he can, even though you only use 1 at a time. This deck uses the entire backpack full of drops all at once.</span>

<span>The overall approach of this deck is equipping monsters with numerous Equip Spells to reach high attack levels that can take down some of the strongest Boss monsters in the game, provided you can survive the negative outcomes of their effects. All of the monsters in the main deck, aside from 2 are Non-effect Monsters, (AKA Normal Monsters), and the Extra Deck monsters are Effect Monsters that protect themselves and your Normal Monsters.</span>

<span>There are 3 basic ways to play this deck, which is partly dependent on your starting hand, and what you draw as the duel goes on. Method A: Equip each Normal Monster with an Equip card and maintain Field advantage. Method B: Give everything to <span>Maha Vailo</span>. Method C: Unleash the power of the Tenyi <span>Link Monsters</span>. With the help of a few special Traps, it is possible to switch playstyles mid-game without putting yourself in a bad spot, allowing you to ruin an opponent's play, or just confuse them.</span>

<span>Before we cover each potential playstyle, lets take a quick look at all the sweet loot drops we've acquired on our quest. These will come in handy with all 3 playstyles.</span>

<span><span><span><em>Axe Of Despair</em></span></span>: Increases a monsters ATK by 1000.</span>
<span><em><span>Mage Power</span></em>: Increases a monsters ATK and DEF by 500 for each Spell/Trap you control. It doesn't matter whether or not the card is Set, as long as its in the zone, it counts. With a full backrow of Spell/Traps, a single monster gains 2500 ATK. Throw down a Field Spell for a total of 3000. This deck contains 2 copies of <span>Mage Power</span>, and having both equipped with full power provides 5000 ATK and DEF. Ouch.</span>
<span><span><em><span>United We Stand</span></em></span>: The equipped monster gains 800 ATK and DEF for each monster you control. Just like <span>Mage Power</span>, this card gets boosted just for having monsters on your Field. Having all 5 main Zones filled and a Monster occupying the Extra Zone provides a nice attack boost of 4800. This deck contains 2 copies of <span>United We Stand</span>, and having both equipped with full power provides 9600 ATK and DEF. Oh mah lawd!</span>
<span><span><em>Metalmorph</em></span>: A Trap Card that provides 300 ATK/DEF. If the equipped monsters attacks, it gains ATK equal to half of the attack target, during damage calculation only.</span>

<span><strong><span>PLAYSTYLE A: ""Tank Class Raid Party""</span></strong></span>
<span>This playstyle revolves around equipping each of your Normal Monsters with at least 1 Equip Spell. As mentioned earlier, the more cards present on your side of the field, the higher the number climbs. Each of your monsters are going to be exactly the same, aside from Type and Attribute, which doesn't matter within this setup. They all are <span>Level 4</span>, and have 2000 ATK and 0 DEF. At the time of writing, there are currently 10 Normal Monsters that share these 3 traits: <span>Alexandrite Dragon, Gene-Warped Warwolf, Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder, Zombino, Mystery Shell Dragon, Gunkan Suship Shari, Leotron, Phantom Gryphon, Megalosmasher X</span>, and <span>Mekk-Knight Avram</span>. You will need 15 of these monsters in the deck; which ones and the amount doesn't matter, except for <span>Mystery Shell Dragon</span>. You absolutely need 3 of this guy, and I'll explain why in Playstyle C. This deck's only <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> and 2 of the 5 <span>Link Monsters</span> are best utilized in this playstyle as well. <strong>Photon Papilloperative</strong> is a <span>Rank 4</span> <strong>XYZ Monster</strong> with 2100 ATK that requires 2 materials to Summon. This monster changes an opponents Defense Position Monster to Attack Position and lowers it's ATK by 600. <span>Defender Of The Labyrinth</span> is a <span>Link Monster</span> who requires 2 Normal Monsters to Summon. He boosts the ATK of all Normal Monsters you control by 500, and lowers the ATK of your opponent's Effect Monsters by 500. If he is slain, you can Special Summon 1 Normal Monster from your Graveyard. Be absolutely sure to give this guy an Equip Spell, as his base ATK is only 1400, which makes him an easy target. You can use <span>Defender Of The Labyrinth's</span> <span>Link Rating</span> <span>of 2 </span>and 1 additional Monster to <span>Link Summon Berserker Of The Tenyi</span>, a Non-Effect Monster rocking a solid 3000 ATK.</span>

<span><strong><span>PLAYSTYLE B: ""Lord Broham's Legacy""</span></strong></span>
<span><span>Maha Vailo</span> and his retrained counterpart <span>Maha Vailo, Light Of The Heavens</span> are downright broken in a setup like this. <span>Maha Vailo</span> is a <span>Level 4</span> Spellcaster sporting 1550 ATK, which might not seem like much, but what makes this guy so special is his amazing effect. He gains an additional 500 ATK for each Equip Spell Card equipped to him. <span>Axe Of Despair</span> alone jumps his ATK up to 3050, enough to just barely overpower <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span>. If you have 6 monsters on your side of the field, and have <span>Maha Vailo</span> equipped with 2 <span>Mage Powers</span>, 2 <span>United We Stand</span>, and an <span>Axe Of Despair</span>, his ATK becomes 19,650. Obviously, his maximum ATK is a bit unessessary, but the point is, its not hard to boost this guy's strength to ridiculous heights. <span>Maha Vailo, Light Of The Heavens</span> more or less works in the same way, but gains additional effects based on the amount of Equip Spells he's holding. What's more, he gains an additional 1000 ATK for each Equip Spell equipped to him. Having 2 or 4 Equip Spells prevents your opponent from activating Monster Effects or Card Effects respectively during the Battle Phase, and having 3 lets you negate an Effect that targets him by sending one of your Equip Spells from anywhere on your side of the field to the Graveyard. Lastly, having 5 doubles Battle Damage this monster inflicts. During the unlikely scenario described earlier, this monsters maximum ATK using this deck's setup is 22,150. In most situations, regular <span>Maha Vailo</span> is much easier to work with, as his retrained version requires 2 Tributes to Summon, also if your Equip Spells are already on the field, without using <span>Collected Power</span>, he won't have much to work with. Once he's fully geared up though, he's damn near impossible to stop. Just 1 warning: BEWARE OF <span>MAGIC CYLINDER</span>!</span>

<span><strong><span>PLAYSTYLE C: ""Tenyi No Like Effect""</span></strong></span>
<span>The remaining 2 <span>Link Monsters</span> in the Extra Deck can honestly put pressure on your opponent by themselves, but having at least 1 of your Normal Monsters present helps even more. Before we reveal the powers of the Tenyi, let's learn how to summon them first. <span>Draco Masters Of The Tenyi</span> has a <span>Link Rating of 3</span> and requires a <span>Link Monster</span> as well, while <span>Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara's</span> <span>Link Rating is 4</span> and also requires 2+ Wyrm Monsters. Obviously, you'll need <span>Draco</span> summoned first before you can get <span>Sahasrara</span>. There are a few ways to do this. Firstly, while you already have a monster on your field, you can Normal Summon a Normal Monster, use it to <span>Link Summon Link Spider</span>, then use it's effect to Special Summon another Normal Monster from your hand, and there you go. 3 Monsters. <span>Draco Masters Of The Tenyi</span> can now be summoned. <span>Double Summon</span> can be used if you intend to get him out in one turn and your Monsters Zones are currently Vacant. The other way to get <span>Draco</span> out is to pop <span>Scapegoat</span>, and use one of the tokens to get <span>Link Spider</span>. A reminder that <span>Scapegoat</span> Tokens are treated as Normal Monsters. <span>Link Spider's</span> only real purpose is to be <span>Link</span> fodder for <span>Draco</span>, it's weak ATK power of 1000 renders it useless otherwise. <span>Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara's</span> summon requirement is 2+ Wyrm monsters. Even though <span>Draco</span> is a Wyrm type, he alone only contributes a <span>Link Rating of 3</span>. This is why we have 3 <span>Mystery Shell Dragons</span>. It is Wyrm type. Using <span>Draco</span> and a <span>Mystery Shell Dragon</span> is all you need to summon <span>Sahasrara</span>. Now, what exactly do they do? Make life difficult for your opponent, that's what. <span>Draco</span> has 2600 ATK and can only be destroyed by battle by a Normal Monster. Give him an Equip Spell and chances are your opponent won't be able to do that. Also, it's effect allows you to destroy your opponents Effect Monsters equal to the number of Normal Monsters you have on the field or in the Graveyard, as long as you do not control another Effect Monster other than <span>Draco</span>. <span>Sahasrara</span> on the other hand, has 3000 ATK, and prevents all of your effect monsters from being targeted by attacks or card effects so long as you control at least 1 Normal Monster. A boosted one will do just fine. At this point you can taunt your opponent if you know that they don't have a <span>Raigeki</span> or <span>Dark Hole</span>. <span>Sahasrara</span> can also target 1 of your opponent's Effect Monsters and generate a Token with ATK power equal to the chosen target, which provides you with the Normal Monster needed to maintain his awesome protection effect.</span>

<span>At last, lets cover the remaining cards among the deck, which can be used effectively in each playstyle. First of all is <span>Double Summon</span>, which is just used to establish Field advantage, summon <span>Maha Vailo, Light Of The Heaverns</span> a bit easier, or quickly perform a <span>Link Summon</span>. <span>Scapegoat</span> is to be used for emergency defense, or a speedy <span>Link Summon</span>. It can also be used for a very fast boost to <span>United We Stand</span>. <span>Armory Call</span> can be used to gather an Equip Spell in a pinch, while <span>Collected Power</span> transfers all Equip Spells on the field to a single target. This is the easiest way to give everything to <span>Maha Vailo</span>, and it even takes your opponents Equip Spells as well. Just be sure not to use this while you have <span>Ekibyo Drakmord</span> active. <span>Ekibyo Drakmord</span> is an Equip Spell that you equip to one of your opponents monsters. While equipped, it renders them unable to attack, and at the end of the 2nd turn after its activation, the equipped monster is destroyed, and <span>Ekibyo Drakmord</span> is returned to your hand. Lastly, you have 3 <span>Dust Tornadoes</span> used to destroy set Spells/Traps, and 2 <span>Mirror Forces</span> to be an ass towards your opponent.</span>

<span>This deck exists purely as an entertainment tool, and is not to be taken seriously. It's not what I would consider ""Top-tier"" and if you don't get it properly setup quickly, it can be tough to recover from your opponent's Field dominance. It is immensely satisfying when you do get it to work though, and was mainly created because I love <span>Maha Vailo</span> so much, and was just curious as to how well I could get him to work. If you're like me, and just want to have fun, give this deck a try. Despite the lengthy review, its very simple to use, it's relatively cheap, and cards like <span>Mage Power</span> and <span>United We Stand</span> are interchangeable and work well in almost any deck. As always, feel free to share any idea/strategies you may have, and I'll look into them. Who knows, maybe together, we can make this a Top-tier deck after all...</span>"

There's Winda too, but you need to use one shaddoll monster ;-;.

&nbsp;

Dragoon combo(Winda is the same just changing the card you use to summon Albion the Branded Dragon): first you need to have Branded Fusion at hand, which is easy to get, since you have 9 searchers (including branded opening) +3 copies of Branded Fusion. Activate Branded Fusion and summon Albion the Branded Dragon using Fallen od Albaz + The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion(or Qadshaddol Keios to get Winda) ~Albion trigger its effects and fusion summon Dragoon(or in case you send Keios to the GY Winda) using only the monster in the GY~ that's all. You can do some variations, but they are situational and don't really change the final product.

You can consistently end on the Mirrorjade Fusion + Sheou with handtraps and traps and plenty of follow up, or play to the strengths of either side of the deck and rely on the other when needed.

<strong>Dragonmaid Package:</strong> Self explanatory.

<strong>Fantasmay:</strong> Material for Sheou and generally good. Can be swapped out.

<strong>Noctovision:</strong> Conflicts with branded fusion but is a good alternative route to spheres when you don't open branded fusion. Also material for Sheou. Can be swapped out.

<strong>Albaz:</strong> Broken with branded fusion. Can also be summoned off of Spheres on the opponents turn as another interruption to superpoly their monster away. You'll often want to discard tidying off of this to revive your dragonmaids.

<strong>Handtraps:</strong> Your choice, but veiler is needed as you need lights as material to branded fusion Divineflame which is the main thing you want to go into for the two card Icejade fusion combo. Also veiler over imperm because imperm conflicts with Fantasmay.

<strong>Branded Fusion:</strong> Absolutely nuts. They key synergy with dragonmaid is that you can send Chamber and Albaz with it to summon Divineflame, which means when you end on the Mirrorjade fusion, you can also revive the Chamber and search to keep fusion or setup backrow.

<strong>Dragon's Mirror:</strong> Meme card that is more clutch than you would think.

&nbsp;

<strong>Core opening combo:</strong>

Hand: Tidying + Branded Fusion + 1 high level dragon

Branded fusion sending Albaz and Chamber for Divineflame - Divineflame effect to discard tidying and shuffle back him and Albaz for Mirrorjade - activate tidying in grave to summon pitched chamber - chamber search changeover - changeover the chamber and high level dragon into Sheou.

What you're left with:
<ul>
 	<li>Mirrorjade Fusion (non-target banish, search Branded fusion in EP if effect used and you send Stigmatika Dragon, Raigeki in EP if outed to clear your way to kill on the follow up),</li>
 	<li>Sheou (omni-negate, plus 2 by summoning Chamber from grave on opponents standby phase for the follow-up, floats into a 3K body with a conditional pop)</li>
 	<li>2 Cards in Hand and you haven't conducted your normal summon yet</li>
</ul>
This type of combo can be achieved with several different combinations of cards, especially with Parlour which can send tidying or changeover from grave and hospitality which lets you extend. If could be stronger if say you drew or already had the changeover, and could search another tidying to set. Even on bad hands, you can probably end with either Sheou or Mirrorjade, and a few traps/handtraps.

Please take note that this deck and other variations of it that I have uploaded are geared to the OG players (i.e. players that started back in 1999 till 2011 with SOME new mechanics that are geared to helping then pick the game back -up) and is for those that just want to enjoy the game as it was intended.

Basically, try to bring the two elemental union beasts out with the searching cards. You can also play more defensively with the high defense normal monsters, and tribute summon to bring out the higher level main deck monsters. I also added more defense to the deck with mirror force, emergency assistance, and the fairly obvious raigeki.

The extra deck is a little more scrambled, but I did this on purpose. I wanted the extra deck to feel more like a bag of tricks, so the whole extra deck is comprised of generic xyz and links (there's also first of the dragons, I suppose). Also, I thought it would be funny to have the majority of the extra deck monsters be fire or water attribute. That's that on that.

If it wasn't already obvious, yeah this is a casual deck. Unions are pretty funny, so I figured the two elemental bois in a deck focused around them (kinda) would be a fun idea. If you do end up using this deck, attempt to have fun.  :)

Thank you, goodnight."

Fallen of Albaz(this is a archetype??): fusion summon Dragons and is compatible with most Branded spells/traps. Also now there's a new card called Branded Fusion that fusion summon using monsters from the main deck :)

Frightfur engine: gives you card advantage.

Phantom Knights engine(;---;): is just here because of its traps and to the one combo.

Predaplant: you only want to have Ophrys in hand for the one card combo. Darlingtonia bricks your hand.

PK-Predaplant Combo: Normal summon Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio ~Activate Scorpio effect and special summon Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra from your deck ~Cobra adds Instant fusion from your deck ~Link summon Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss ~Using Cherubini effect send The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots from your to the GY ~Banish Boots from your GY, add Phantom Knights Fog Blade and set it ~Now you can do anything with Despias or Polymerization as long you don't use Cherubini in fusion summons or if you don't have nothing to do jump to the next step ~Activate Instant fusion and special summon El Shaddoll Winda TO ONE OF CHERUBINI LINK MARKERS (remember, this is to protect Winda from being destroyed in the end phase) ~End the turn.

I ain't so dedicated to explain every combo and every card to you guys, so good luck in your test duels and at reading all cards.

!Update: added Albion the Branded Dragon.

!!Update: i added one Edge Imp Chain and took of one Frightfur Patchwork. Now the deck brick less.

Now that i think about it, maybe if I've added the ratios along with the engines description would be easier to understand the combo &#x1f914;...

<span>Duality is a budget alternative and can be swapped out for prosperity if the wallet allows it.</span>

<span>When going first you want to see Therizia at all cost. You'll want to set Domain from the deck off of her effect if you did not open it. Then proceed to just set some more purple cards. </span>

<span>As most of the time you don't really go into any extra deck plays turn 1, duality's restriction isn't that bad. </span>

<span>The deck can make alot of plays during the opponent's turn, like summoning both Fusion boss monsters and if you have Lord of the Heavenly Prision revealed it's even better because you get to set a trap from deck for free. For example Eldlixir, so you also have The Golden Lord next turn.</span>

<span>The fact that you pay almost all of your life points doesn't really matter. As long as you have enough traps in the GY to protect from battle and effect damage, your fine. Also while your below 2000 your Stealthbegia Fusion monster just says ""free solemn strikes and judgements for days!""</span>

<span>One last thing. Always remember your Stealthbegias second effect. I was able to win so many games because noone reads it's second effect. Just being able to Quick effect burn your opponent for like 3000 when they chain Savage or Baronne de Fleur to one of your other effects is so nice.</span>

<span>Also... remember to have fun, your opponents won't ,but atleast your gonna have a blast.</span>

I use <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a> because in conjunction with the Tenyi this card has enhanced usefulness in that it can banish any Wyrm I need at the time and add it back to the hand with <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Adhara"">Tenyi Spirit - Adhara</a>. I don't use Swordsoul's Reborn Spell because particularly all the combos that use it I can do them using <a data-name=""Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing"">Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing</a> instead most of the time, of course the results will be a little different but I also believe it's okay to have a Monster Reborn in that deck to revive main deck cards or Synchro Boss Monsters.
<a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> package and <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> have synergy with Tenyi monsters because in the worst case if you open without a move you Special Summon any Tenyi Lv7 and can do together with Veiler the <a data-name=""ChiXiao"">ChiXiao</a>, Along with Ash Blossom the <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> and <a data-name=""PSY-Frame Driver"">PSY-Frame Driver</a> in this deck is much better than it looks because besides letting the Tenyi's effects live you can together with Adhara access <a data-name=""Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing"">Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing</a> which is an excellent card going second.
I don't use the generic Synchro 8 Dragite and Omega or simulate because I realize that most of the time I don't choose to access them although in several combos that I'll demonstrate below they are used so it's your choice to decrease the number of Link Monsters Tenyi that I use and put these Synchros in place.
I'm not a big fan of the <a data-name=""Chaofeng"">Chaofeng</a> combo because it's nice not to lose to Gamma, <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a>, Veiler and anyone who likes to use <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre"">Ghost Ogre</a> but you end up still losing to <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> in Normal Summon and whoever knows the format knows that Impermanence is the Hand Trap more common in any meta deck, even those who have reduced the number of hand traps in the main deck still choose to use Impermanence for its versatility by going first or second.

Now I'm going to demonstrate all the combos I learned with this deck: (Water = Mo Ye, Wind = Taia, Fire = Longyuan, Xiangjian = Swordsowl, Baroness = Baronne)

The Piri Reis Map card is a great support for Sacred Beasts.

Other Extra-Deck options are: Topologic Bomber Dragon and Accesscode Talker, Zeus can be played instead of Evilswarm Night.

Other Side-Deck options are: Token Collector when playing against Swordsoul or Sky Striker.

BUT of course the best engine is Destroyer Pheonix Enforcer, but since this is meant to be a budget deck, it's not on the list."

I tell you hwhat it's not chainblocking. Anyways, here's a decklist that offers even more chainblocking.</span>

<span>Of course I wouldn't make this list if chainblocking is all that it has to offer, although it is one of my favorite mechanics in Yu-Gi-Oh. It also offers</span> <span><a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a> </span><span>and</span> <span><a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a></span> <span>targeting protection from both card effect and attacks.</span>

<span>I'm not making this out to be the next best thing in Floowandereeze and do keep in mind that this combo does interfere with</span> <span><a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a></span><span>. Still, it's a nice combo that I want to highlight.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>The Combo</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span><span><strong>Requirement</strong>:</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map"">Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map</a></span> <span>and</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Robina"">Floowandereeze &amp; Robina</a></span><span>/</span><span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Eglen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Eglen</a></span></span></li>
 	<li><span><strong>Diggers</strong>: <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Journey Preparations"">Floowandereeze and the Journey Preparations</a> <span>and</span> <a data-name=""Pot of Duality"">Pot of Duality</a><span>/</span>Prosperity<span>/</span><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Extravagance</a></span> // While I'm not playing Prosperity or Extravangance the Extra Deck is your Oyster so whether you want to fill it up with Ghost Reaper targets, random Normal Fusion monsters or monsters depicting your latest Yu-Gi-Oh fan fiction, a battle between The Dark Magicians using the Claw of Hermos weapons and Dragon Master Knight summoning the Numeron Gates, doesn't matter. Play Pots and ED slots to your liking.</span></li>
 	<li><span><strong>Combo (Robina)</strong>: <em>Everything is chainblocked</em></span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Activate Map, revealing Robina, banishing Eglen and then NS the revealed Robina.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Robina CL1 and Eglen CL2. Robina adds Simorgh and NS Eglen.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Eglen CL1 and Simorgh CL2. Eglen adds</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Floowandereeze &amp; Empen</a></span> <span>and NS Empen.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Empen CL1, Simorgh CL2 and Robina CL3. Simorgh sends itself and adds</span> <span><a data-name=""Simorgh Sky Battle"">Simorgh Sky Battle</a></span><span>. Empen adds</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town"">Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town</a></span><span>.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Set Dreaming Town and Sky Battle.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><span><strong>Combo (Eglen)</strong>: <em>Not everything is chainblocked</em></span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>It is the same combo with searches in a different order.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Since you'll first add Eglen and add Simorgh with Robina afterwards you are vulnerable when activating Robina. But still, by then you already have access to Empen and a NS left over.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><span><strong>Opponent's Turn (Robina)</strong>:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Activate Map when your opponent NS CL1 and Sky Battle CL2, with Map summoning Robina.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Robina CL1 and Eglen CL2. Robina adds Barrier Statue then NS Barrier Statue</span></li>
 	<li><span>On resolution: Activate Dreaming Town, summing Eglen.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Eglen adds Avian and then NS Avian, tributing Eglen and Robina.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Dreaming Town CL1 and Robina CL2.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Your opponent's NS is flipped face-down, you control Empen, Avian, Barrier Statue (and Simorgh just for show).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><span><strong>Opponent's Turn (Eglen)</strong>:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Activate Map when your opponent NS CL1 and Sky Battle CL2, with Map summoning Eglen.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Eglen Cl1 and Robina CL2. Eglen adds Avian and then NS Robina.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Robina adds Barrier Statue and NS Avian, tributing Eglen and Robina.</span></li>
 	<li><span>Eglen CL1 (can be done in the next step, too) and Dreaming Town CL2, summoning Barrier Statue.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Same Board with the difference that Dreaming Town can't be activated in the GY as Avian was already summoned. It doesn't matter as much as both Avian and Barrier Statue cannot be targeted for an attack.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span>This combo prevents your opponent from using <span><a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a></span>, or <span><a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a></span> on your Barrier Statue, while allowing for even more chainblocking when setting up your board.</span>

<span>This is the interaction with only the 2 card combo. If you banished either <span>Floowandereeze &amp; Stri</span> or <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Toccan"">Toccan</a></span> using Journey Preparations you can fully chainblock the Eglen combo as well.</span>"

Trading Card Game Known as the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game (遊☆戯☆王オフィシャルカードゲーム, Yū-Gi-Ō Ofisharu Kādo Gēmu) in Asia, is a Japanese collectible card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters created by manga artist Kazuki Takahashi, which is the main plot device during the majority of the manga franchise, Yu-Gi-Oh, and its various anime adaptations and spinoff series.

Brave Token, the series takes inspiration from the character archetypes typical of a JRPG—warrior, mage, and the like—with the ""Brave Token"" being a stand-in for the typical silent player character (which somehow explains the player being a token.)

""Tenyi"" (天てん威い Ten'i) is an archetype introduced in Rising Rampage, made up of Wyrm monsters with various Attributes and centered around Non-Effect Monsters.

&#x1f332;Tips for this deck&#x1f332; :

1. If you have used normal summon you can also use the effect of ""Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing"" for Special Summon Yang Zing monster from graveyard for activation condition of ""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"".

2. You can use the effect ""Baronne de Fleur"" in Standby Phase on the opponent's turn if you have used the omni negate effect in your turn, you can special summon ""Wandering Gryphon Rider"" from the graveyard, if you still control ""Brave Token"" .

3. If you still have ""Baronne de Fleur"" in Standby Phase on your own turn, you can special summon ""Swordsoul of Taia"" then use the effect to synchro summon ""Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing"".

4. You can search ""Archnemeses Protos"" using ""Swordsoul Emergence"" if you control synchro monster.

Enjoy!,"Ok so, to begin with I mainly got inspired from my favourite yugituber for the whole deck. Thus the deck you will see isn't fully my creation. Anyway I think we all do that but when we do it's better to say it in order to avoid any misunderstandings. Now on to the deck.

Well in youtube you can find many videos that will show you 1 card or 2 card combos with D/D/D. Yes I know that for the deck to make strong enough boards 1 card isn't enough. Recently enough though I came across this particular D/D/D 1 card combo:

Starting hand: Dark Contract with the Gate
<ol>
 	<li>Activate Gate</li>
 	<li>Search D/D Copernicus</li>
 	<li>Normal summon Copernicus and with his effect send to the GY one of your D/D Lamias</li>
 	<li>Activate Lamia's effect, by sending Gate to your GY she shall special summon herself</li>
 	<li>Link Lamia and Copernicus away (Lamia gets banished) for a D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh</li>
 	<li>Activate Gilgamesh's effect and set to your pendulum scales D/D Griffon and D/D Savant Thomas</li>
 	<li>Pendulum summon Copernicus</li>
 	<li>Activate Griffon's pendulum effect, by targeting Copernicus who gains 500 atk and Griffon destroys himself</li>
 	<li>Activate Thoma's pendulum effect which lets you add Griffon from your extra deck to your hand</li>
 	<li>Activate Griffon's effect and special summon him</li>
 	<li>By overlaying Griffon and Copernicus XYZ summon your D/D/D Wave King Caesar</li>
 	<li>Link away Caesar and Gilgamesh and summon a second Gilgamesh</li>
 	<li>Activate Caesar's effect and add Dark Contract with the Swamp King from your deck to your hand</li>
 	<li>Activate Swamp King</li>
 	<li>Activate Swamp King's effect and fusion summon D/D/D Flame King Genghis by banishing Gilgamesh and Copernicus from the GY</li>
 	<li>By overlaying the Gilgamesh on your field, XYZ summon D/D/D Amnesty King Doom Makina</li>
 	<li>Activate Genghis's effect to special summon Griffon from the GY</li>
 	<li>Activate Griffon's effect to add D/D/D Headhunt from your deck to your hand</li>

How about a deck with an insane grindgame or crackback value? If ","Salamangreats are very much a “Jack of all trades, master of none” style of deck. While the deck often plays and handles in the style that a combo deck would, the actual gameplay of Salamangreats often times better resembles that of a control deck. It is a very linear deck that is somewhat lacking in pivot options in favor of having some incredible crackback capabilities and an outstanding grindgame. So while you’re not setting up fields that are packed to the brim with negates, board wipes, or big numbers, you will be able to rebuild your fields and keep playing the game with relative ease, while also impairing your opponent’s moves using the large plethora of handtraps the the deck is capable of running, as well as the two Salamangreat traps, Rage and Roar. Will of the Salamangreat and Balelynx will both give the deck some pretty good resilience, and Jack Jaguar + Sunlight Wolf will allow you to recycle an absolutely massive amount of resources that will help you dominate the grindgame. To top it all off, once you’ve whittled down your opponent enough, you can make Accesscode Talker using Update Jammer extremely easily, which will let you clear up your opponent’s field a bit more and attack twice, in order to deal a staggering total of 10,600 damage, which is more than enough to close games."
