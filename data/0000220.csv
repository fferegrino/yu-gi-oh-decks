This one remind one the first SD seto kiba and yugioh moto for me and mine little brother….he didn’t like playing as much. Even back then I always wonder how the yugioh moto Sd could every beat Seto kiba Sd back in toy R us which I think are all closed now.  Maiden with eyes of blue has a great combo with Apparition with Eyes of Blue by playing Apparition with Eyes of Blue first then summing Maiden with of blue for the bounce back and special summons of two blues eyes from with maiden effect and another with apparitions two fusion summon blues-eyes twin burst dragon if needed. Also Apparition with eyes of Blues is great two get Blue-eyes alternative white dragon and then destroy target monster on the field then used Apparitions effect to return and get dragon spirt of white well with the idea hand.  Blues –eyes jet dragon is well it speak for itself instead of destroying anything it return to the hand so it get you out of a lot of sticky situations, also you can special summons it from the field and the graveyard which must be nightmare for the opponent. The tyrant of d is great since you pick the target for the opponent monster to attack; then discard blue-eyes to special summon then special summon the blues-eyes from the graveyard. Mystical elf-mystical burst stream is in there for a another light monster with tyrant of d. special summon the blues-eyes used to summon tyrant and have tyrant effect to change the attack monster to blues-eyes white dragons.  Ultimate Fusion; I used it for Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon but I bet there a better way to used it but I haven’t been playing it much. Rage with Eyes of Blue is mine “BUCKET” card when the chips are just active that two get 3 blues-eyes and if they stay on the filed long enough to xyz to Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo for the 3 turn count down. Well that ideally but really it would normally only get since blue-eyes won’t summon in the graveyard with this spell card :’( The Melody of Awakening Dragon  So you can pick witch dragon is in your hand.  Also for the extra deck I have  Number 97: Draglubion, Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon, Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy, Number 100: Numeron Dragon, Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon, Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon added with the Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon and Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon. Well I don’t understand how the extra deck play that well and it a mess right now maybe I could clean it up. Also I don’t have side done for it since I haven’t been playing it as much as Kuribho.

You get full combo off of Nunu pitch Nauya then resummon Nunu and any other lv4 for King of the Feral Imps, add another Nauya and use it to send Keurse, tribute Feral Imps for Keurse then revive Nauya and add Water Lilly, Water Lilly can send Masked Chameleon then summon it since you should have 5 reptiles in grave. Synchro summon Mathmech Magma using Nauya and Chameleon then use Magma and Keurse to summon Bishbaalkin. Bishbaalkin summons 5 tokens to each side then link him off with one token for Reprodocus (make sure that Reproducus points to a token). Make the token under Reprodocus into a reptile then link the reptile token and another token into Reptilianne Echidna and link the remaining tokens and Reprodocus into Unchained Abomination. Use Echidna's effect and add Aron, the Ogdoadic King, any 2 level 4 reptiles and Performapal Lizardraw and Swincobra. Scale up your Performapals and pend summon the 2 lvl 4s and use them to summon Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame and use it's effect to discard Aron and give A-counters to your opponents tokens. Then use Lizardraw's effect to pop itself and draw 1 and use Unchained Abomination to pop Alien Shocktrooper. Shocktrooper can resummon a bunch of reptiles and now it's the hard part. You should either be able to special summon Reptilianne Coatl then summon Reptilianne Lamia or use Reptilianne Spawn to get either a lvl2 or 2 lvl1 tokens but either way is possible since you can search either card. Make Reptilianne Hydra and draw 5 cards by destroying the tokens on your opponents field.  This deck sucks but I kinda want to buy it."

Once you feel like it is safe go for the kill with your invoked monsters. Another thing is the Dogmatika Engine that is used to keep control on the board and is just more material for Mechaba.  The way the swarm works is you get Aleister ASAP, use magical meltdown to get aleister or draw it normally and quickly get yourself an Invocation so  that you can loop the combo of, 1. Normal Aleister and add Invocation 2. fuse into a monster of choice 3. Use invocation's effect to return it to the deck and Aleister to your hand to re-enter the loop next turn. Then slowly but surely your entire board will be filled with monsters that can take your opponent out."

When going first, the deck can usually either end on a simple Platinum Gadget and ABC-Dragon Buster or that same combination in addition to I:P Masquerena which allows for the likes of Appaloosa, Goddess of the Bow or Underworld Goddess of the Closed World to be summoned on the opponent's turn for additional disruption. Even in the worst case scenario wherein a tagged out ABC-Dragon Buster gets negated by the likes of something like Called by the Grave, the inclusion of Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax allows for a powerful wall monster to be summoned that can disrupt your opponent to some degree when sent to the GY.  On your second turn, or even your first when going second depending on your hand, you're usually capable of finishing off the opponent by link climbing into Accesscode Talker through abusing the effect of C-Crush Wyvern and sequentially summoning the Knightmare monsters. The deck primarily relies on handtraps, with more traditional trap cards being sided in for subsequent games, to increase the effectiveness of Crossout Designator while simultaneously disrupting your opponent in the event of them going first. The inclusion of PSY-Framegear Gamma aids in disrupting your opponent if you're forced to go second while otherwise countering their handtraps and gaining additional advantage for yourself through the summon of PSY-Framelord Omega or a link monster on your first turn.  In order to avoid bricking, this build runs two copies of Union Driver. If you run but a single copy, you have a 12.5% chance of drawing it when going first in contrast to having a 1.28% chance of drawing both copies when running two. Drawing a lone copy of Union Driver isn't particularly terrible, either, if you have another in deck. In the absence of drawing one of your ABC monsters alongside Union Hanger in your opening hand, possessing a single Union Driver in their place still allows you to end on either ABC-Dragon Buster and I:P Masquerena or those two monsters in addition to Platinum Gadget, a choice entirely dependent on which potential handtrap you fear at the time, due to the nature of C-Crush Wyvern's effect, which only activates if you already possess a valid target to be special summoned in your hand at the time of activation, and your ability to choose whether to resolve the effect of C-Crush Wyvern or B-Buster Drake first.  The sidedeck has been built to increase your chances of victory when going first through incorporating powerful trap cards. Said side deck also features additional handtraps that further increase the viability of Crossout Designator when going first or better disrupt your opponent when going second. Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion also has the added benefit of protecting your cards from the likes of D D Crow, Ally of Justice Cycle Reader, and even Called by the Grave in addition to better disrupting your opponent depending on their deck.  With that said, I am interested in any suggestions pertaining to the main, side, or extra deck especially as the metagame evolves."

Being normal monsters, they are easy to cheat out from the deck using Successor Soul and Unexpected Dai respectively. Successor Soul is non-destruction removal but it requires us to tribute one of our own effect monsters and Unexpected Dai allows us enough swarming ability to make little extra deck plays. If you draw any of these normal monsters, use Moray of Greed to put them back. Citadel Whale, Legendary Fisherman II,  Sea Stealth Attack, and A Legendary Ocean form a little engine together. A Legendary Ocean lets us summon Citadel Whale with one tribute or Legendary Fisherman II with no tributes. Foolish Burial should be used on Piwraithe (A good Successor Soul sacrifice) or Citadel Whale. Arnis the Empowered Warrior can summon Glacier Aqua Madoor, who makes a dead Gogiga Gagagigo in hand useful, and is also a hand trap himself. Along with Ash Blossom, I have 4 Fire attribute monsters, allowing me to teach Frost and Flame Dragon which is a free summon with removal. Rage of Kairyu-Shin works off original levels so it is good with this deck as well, adding more removal. Dragon's Mirror lets you summon First of the Dragons which is hard to out. Reasoning can get you a big monster for free, and you have a lot of levels so it is hard for them to guess correctly. Skill Drain is good for this deck as it uses almost no monster effects on the field. Raigeki, HFD, Reborn, and Called By are all staples.  The extra deck is a toolbox that works with or without ALO's level modulation.

Going first build, only 4 handtraps main. ","Swordsoul Tenyi can make Chaofeng with Baxia which will prevent our opponent from activating any light monster effects next turn. This is very good vs DRYTRON. Swordsoul Tenyi can play through 2-3 handtraps and still end on a decent board with Fleur (Omninegate), Grandmaster (on field monster negate) and Dragite (Spell Negate).  This swordsoul build tries to SS at least one Tenyi first to go into Monk, then SS Longyuan to make Fleur, NS Taia / Mo Ye to make Grandmaster, fetch Summit, SS Moye/Taia to make Dragite. End board is Fleur, Grandmaster, Dragite. If we start with 2 Tenyis, we can make Grandmaster without a single NS. If we start with Vessel, we can also set up enough tenyis to make Grandmaster. If we get handtrapped on the NS, we can go into Tenyi Shaman LINK2 to discard and SS from GY to trigger another Swordsoul. We can use Vessel and Dragon Circle as extenders and even to chain on veiler/Imperm on Taia/Mo Ye so that we still get the tokens. Opening Dragonsword is a one card combo: add and NS Taia, make Grandmaster cl1, cl2 Taia dump Mo Ye (chainblocking ash), add Summit, SS Mo Ye from GY with Summit, make Dragite, draw 1, have 2 negates on board.  Pot of Desires is perfect in this deck because we usually do not care about banishing 10 cards, also draw 2 without compromising the Mo Ye draw is really good (Prosperity compromises the Mo Ye draw which is very bad).  Weaknesses: Token Collector: We play 2 Ghost Belle to stop token collector +1 more in side. Shenshen can help, the Duke can take care of it, Vishuda can bounce it.  Sky Striker/ Control Decks: Making Fleur with Longyuan is going -1. if we go first, we are down -1 as well. Swordsoul Tenyi is no combo deck generating tons of plus. We should side out our ash and belle, side in anti backrow cards, opt to go second to be up in card advantage. We will lose grind games vs. control decks.  &nbsp;  This is a build for locals, not for YCS, no droplets, no tactics, no power cards that might be too risky vs. all sorts for Tier 2 / Rogue Decks."

Anyway I found that Small World actually works really well in this deck and it can be even better with the Destiny Hero engine I included in the deck. Small World and the Destiny Hero engines that I included in the deck can be swapped for Desires/Solemn Strike/Dragoon Engine/Zeus Package or something of the sort. This deck has so much free space and is fun to see what all can fit in the deck. Currently the deck is 43 cards, and if you have any other suggestions on some other cards I would be happy to see any input in the comments. Also here are some Small World lines of play that could be used.  Gamma/Ash/Fraktall (in hand) -&gt; Kitt (in deck) -&gt; Rescue Cat (adds to hand)  Effect Veiler (in hand) -&gt; Ash (in deck) -&gt; Fraktall/Kitt/Nervall (adds to hand)  Destiny Hero Celestial (in hand) -&gt; Fraktall (in deck) -&gt; Kitt (adds to hand)  Psy-Frame Driver (in hand) -&gt; Destiny Hero Dasher (in deck) -&gt; Kitt (adds to hand)  These are the most optimal ways I have found that Small World can be used in the deck, and using Crow also has some cool interactions in the deck. Also it has the added bonus of being able to unbrick your hand if you open garnets or too many handtraps. Anyways this is my spicy version of Tri-Brigade after BODE, hope you guys enjoy."

It a fun deck it has new OCG cards the original idea for this is ""Ha I see your cards""  Ghost sister in this deck because I enjoy her effect gain life for each special summons but it come with a kick that if they don’t mine LP is half instead so I used at the started the draw phase but after reading this I just might have a chain with your fusion spell. There all the “spying/reveling” two ignored mine opponents so they used their spell/trap destroy and miss and hit waking the dragon two special summon the un-kill-able Beelzeus of the Diabolic Dragons…well you still can send it awhile or I could use mind crush to send there good card away.  Then there the legendary Baronne de Fleur definitely a great flower rose with the thorns if you play it wrong, you might just drop it. How I was going to Synchro the card(so heartless)  by Wandering Gryphon Rider summons it on mine opponent turn and then drawing Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood for Synchro into 10.  Mind control to take control of a monster and link summons to keep a monster on mine field. Then lastly mine favorited new cards top share and gift exchange; first I used top share to have the opponent pick the card they needed and put it on the top of deck then used gift exchange to shuffle their deck…it was so closed.  At last Mimicking Man-Eater Bug the monster that can’t be destroyed in battle for that extra protections.  Well at least no one has the time to read thanks anyway.  Sincerely,  Professor M.  PS. good thing I'm broke sorry real player if you don't have any of the cards."

Not the good kind, the actual sickness kind of sick. The having the flu and sneezing kind of sick. And while German is by many considered to be a loud and rough sounding language the German localization for this archetype sounds fantastic! Wanderbrise. Wander is pronounced like the Wanda, either the Marvel character or Wanda from the Fairly Oddparents, depending on your generation. Brise sounds like someone is trying to say cheese in their most racist Japanese accent but with a Br instead of the Ch.</span>  <span>Anyways, with the German lesson out of the way, let's get into the archetype.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>The Legendary Bird Trio...</span>  <span>These Arctic Terns travel from the North to the South and from the South to the Nord every year.</span>  <span>Their travel route is depicted in their Field Spell,</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map"">Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map</a></span><span>. Upon first read it's okay, once you know how the archetype works it's strong and once you get to know the deck it's isane. It turns any Floowandereeze into a starter, gives you an extra Normal Summon AND allows you to combo during your opponents turn.</span>  <span>Along the way they meet fantastical places, such as</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds"">Unexplored Winds</a></span><span>, where our bird find rest on a mountain accompanied by a most magical sunset, which allows you to send one monster you control and any <em>card</em> your opponent controls for a Tribute Summon. Truly a magical sunset. Our friends also find shelter in the most</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town"">dreamiest of towns</a></span><span>. Here they allow you to conduct a Normal Summon and Book of Moons your opponent's entire board upon Tribute Summoning. Dreamy. The</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze and the Scary Sea"">scary sea</a></span> <span>is scary so let's not talk about it. (It's a really good card but a little too win more in this tightly packed deck to justify it's inclusion)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>...The friends they meet along the way...</span>  <span>Each of the Floowandereeze Birds has the effect that if it leaves the field face-up it gets banished instead and if you Normal Summon a Winged Beast adds itself back to hand (sounds like a lot of chainblocking and you'd be right, it is). They each have an effect that triggers upon their Normal Summon which then allows you to Normal Summon one Winged Beast monster.</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Robina"">Robina</a></span> <span>searches a Level 4 or lower Winged Beast</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Eaglen"">Eaglen</a> <span>searches you a Level 7 or higher Winged Beast</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Strich"">Strich</a></span> <span>banished a card from either players GY</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Toccan"">Toccan</a></span> <span>adds a banished Floowandereeze card (<em>card</em> not monster. I only now got that)</span></li> </ul> <span>Finally they meet</span> <span><a data-name=""Floowandereeze &amp; Empen"">Empen</a></span><span>, a super cute penguin. Empen kind of works the same. Upon Summon they add you a Floowandereeze Spell or Trap to hand and then allows you to Normal Summon <em>any</em> monster (this will come up later). He reduces the ATK of the monster it's battling and functions as a Floodgate against Link Monsters.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Mist Valley Apex Avian"">Mist Valley Apex Avian</a></span><span>, a literal winged beast, and</span> <span><a data-name=""Raiza the Mega Monarch"">Raiza the Mega Monarch</a></span><span>, a winged beast without wings and a chicken head, are your boss monsters.</span>  <span>Then there's</span> <span>DD Crow</span><span>. This crow's a pacifist and despises murder, therefore it travels alone. If you already have access to Eaglen, which is usually the case past turn one or when you using the Field Spell, this is a great card to add off of Robina.</span>  <span>The plan is to summon Robina to search Eaglen who then searches Empen to then adds you Dreaming Town. When summoning Empen you can add your Level 1 bird back to hand to do this all over again during your opponent's turn, this time summoning either Avian or Raiza.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>...AND DIVINE WRATH.</span>  <span>Well this took a turn for the extreme. The Extra Deck really doesn't matter much in this deck, allowing for a small Dogmatika engine. I'm saying small since - oh yeah I should probably mention you can't Special Summon the turn you use any of your birds effects - you can't Special Summon and cards like Fleur and Nexus need to sit this one out. Yet strangely enough, there's a lot of synergy between this engine and the birds.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom"">Ferrijit</a></span> <span>can be sent to add</span> <span><a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Ecclesia</a></span><span>, allowing you to draw deeper into your deck and unbricking your hand.</span> <span><a data-name=""Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"">Shuraig</a></span> <span>can search you Robina or any other Level 1 Winged Beast as long as one tri-type is banished already.</span>  <span>Ecclesia can be Normal Summoned at the end of your combo using Empen's effect (I told you it'll come up) to search you</span> <span><a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a></span> <span>for extra interruption.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Certain choices and contrivances to conjure celestial conquest</span>  <span>If you don't know what that means don't worry, me neither. What I do know is that this deck leaves a lot of room for intricate maneuvers.</span>  <span>Once your opponent is out of ressources Raiza can essentially Yata-Lock your opponent by stacking their deck with a bad card and bouncing Raiza ever turn.</span>  <span>Gold Sarc allows for every Floowandereeze to start your combo by banishing Robina (or Eaglen). It also gives you an extra chainblock.</span>  <span>Dimension Shifter can single handedly buy you a turn or win you a game. It conflicts with the Dogmatika engine but Ferrijit can rid you of D Shifter if you don't need it.</span>  <span>If you have both the Field Spell and Dreaming Town you can conduct a Normal Summon Twice, allowing you to summon Apex Avian upon their first Normal Summon, use it's effect and then summon Apex Avian again while flipping every monster your opponent controls face-down.</span>  <span><a data-name=""Dark Simorgh"">Dark Simorgh</a></span> <span>can shut down control decks completely and</span> <span><a data-name=""Rallis the Star Bird"">Rallis the Star Bird</a></span> <span>has 3200 ATK if you're facing a</span> <span><a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a></span><span>. The only other way to out Sigma is by having a Level 1 Bird left on your side of the field and one in hand or the Field Spell face-up and two birds in hand (both very common) to go into</span> <span><a data-name=""Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale"">Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale</a></span><span>, swing for some direct damage, overlay into a 4 material</span> <span><a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a></span> <span>and hope your opponent is forced to crash them.

What started as a 40 dollar budget deck (that apparently beat Invoked Shaddolls and got 5th place in a 30 man tourney) has evolved into a link/syncho/ritual deck that can support even Cyber Slash Harpie Lady, Baronne de Fleur and Borrelsword Dragon.  &nbsp;  While I went about adjusting the extra deck, i realized that i could technically go into links if I were using tokens and Linkuriboh, so I've gone ahead and done that. Magikeys are also used in order to run synchro monsters in this deck.  &nbsp;  You have to be <span><strong>really careful</strong></span> when going about summoning your monsters because your Impcantations lock up your extra deck while there's even a single one on the board. As long as you know how to do basic addition and subtraction, you'll get the hang of it.  &nbsp;  EDIT 1: Vanity's Fiend is an OP monster in this deck, lmao  &nbsp;  EDIT 2: This deck sucks going second, so i tried to alleviate that as much as I could. You could probably get away with running a 42 card deck by taking out one of the Droplets (to be honest, you can also run Dark Ruler No More if price is an issue), but i highly recommend running the 3 Nibiru and 3 Re-Spark since Stardust Dragon gives you extra negates while also serving as a body on the field. But yeah, i had to throw something in there to stop monsters like Dragoon since they can cut your turn short.  &nbsp;  EDIT 3: The deck list speaks for itself. I've decided to add Deskbot/Halqifibrax support into it. While i normally don't like to use Halqifibrax (since i like to build more casual decks), its honestly a necessity in this deck when it comes to applying real pressure. Other than that, i've taken out the Resparks (you could also run Dark Ruler No More as opposed to Droplets if money is an issue), and i've moved stuff like Vanity and Nibiru to the side deck.  &nbsp;  EDIT 4: I've embraced the fat deck strategy after seeing a Magikey Megalith build on mkohl40's channel. After having done this, my hand consistency has gotten a lot better. It also helps that I'm running Magikey World and the PSY-Framelord Gamma kit in here now, along with 3 copies of Prosperity. Emergency Teleport can also target Penciplume, which is great for getting ritual monsters out of the graveyard. In all honesty, i don't know how i'd further improve this deck. This looks complete to me, but i may find some room for optimization in the extra deck and side deck. I'm not removing the Shooting Star Dragon kit (at least not at the moment) because it's really funny that this deck can technically go into Shooting Star Dragon.  &nbsp;  EDIT 5: Realized there was a better Shooting Star Dragon i could go into. I can also go into it using my Halqifibrax Combo assuming i can follow up with Debris Dragon in my hand to pull Candoll out of my GY and go into Stardust Dragon. Going into Cyberse Quantum Dragon is really important to me in this deck since it gives me protection, so I'd have to forego the Herald for my level 4 synchro tuner.  &nbsp;  EDIT 6: Running Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing in the main deck now. I also threw out the level 4 synchro tuner for Shooting Riser Dragon.  &nbsp;  EDIT 7: So i'm probably going to stop updating this now unless new cards come out that can further improve this. I feel like i've pushed this deck as far as it can go at the moment for the non-budget build, and i've already finished making my IRL build for the Big Mac Synchro Turbo (which can be viewed here: https://ygoprodeck.com/big-mac-synchro-turbo/). If anyone has any further suggestions, feel free to comment on this page.  &nbsp;  EDIT 8 (final edit): I thought it couldn't be done, but here it is... True Synchro Burger Turbo. This includes a pipeline that doesn't require Halqifibrax using Mare Mare. Its just very reassuring to know that this deck can operate without the need of Halqifibrax now if we ever get into a situation where its ever banned. I'll be making incremental updates to this page as i figure out the side deck, but otherwise, i think i have it all figured out now."

With the July 21 banlist I thought it was really cool having to reinvent how the deck works having to do <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a> to return the <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus </a>to the GY on the opponent's SP but I wasn't yet comfortable with how the deck could play against interactions and have a satisfying grind game because I'm a combo player who prefers to take advantage plays with good follow ups and minimal interactions to ensure I survive the opponent's turn and win the game easily on the back than someone who likes to put multiple negates in the table with an ftk field and the deck was missing something so I decided to stop playing with it until I found a new way to make the deck extend plays efficiently after hand traps. Now I bring you the solution I found which was to use the Archetype of Ogdoadic as an engine to complement the strategy and I am very happy with the synergies I found between the two engines. As you can see in the decklist I'm using a very reduced Dino engine because I don't want to brick with this deck and the Ogdoadic cards already improve my Grind Game a lot so I'm worried about increasing this number and the only card I'd really like to having space to use on the main deck is <a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops </a>but for now I'm testing it on the side deck. The Ogdoadic engine is also reduced and I chose to use only the cards necessary for its basic functioning and which has synergy with the Dino engine cards as well. Finally there was still room for 8 tech cards which is a number that guarantees seeing at least 1 hand trap in the starting hand most of the time and I've already tested a lot using blind second cards like <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talents"">Triple Tactics Talents</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a> and I say that besides being a lot of guys i often analyze replays of matches i play and if they were hand traps instead they would have been much more effective, of course there are decks where you use a hand trap and he keeps playing as if nothing had happened but most of the time a well given hand trap does affect a lot of the opponent's plays. Not to mention that this deck can use the best hand trap in the game in my opinion which is the <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> in the main deck and the <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> I use instead of the Effect Veiler because first you don't use much tech card and Impermanence is a live Trap if you give it 6th card draw which Veiler is not and although I have <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler"">Chaos Ruler</a> in Extra Deck I have better cards to add to the hand like Tyranno or <a data-name=""Oviraptor"">Oviraptor </a>than I mill to gy. Finally about the extra deck I'm satisfied at the moment with the choices made and I just miss not having room for another generic Rank 4 like <a data-name=""Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>. Overall I wouldn't add any more cards for Links monsters and the Rank 8 engine and I'm testing <a data-name=""Borreload Savage"">Borreload Savage</a> instead of <a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a> because in the grind game it's very easy to do and helps a lot to have a more solid win condition . As this deck has little room for tech and Ogdoadic's cards are a plus for the opponent if he has monsters in the GY so I always play first differently from other versions of Dino I used and I'm doing a lot of testing hands so I can see all the possibilities to extend plays after hand traps which is the purpose of the deck: pass with a field that guarantees you to survive the opponent's turn with versatile interactions and very good follow ups. The basic deck combo is to do the standard Scrap Dino moves like Oviraptor + Baby, Misc + Baby, Archosaur + Baby, Lost World + Oviraptor etc and the first extra deck monster you make is Evolzar Dolkka most of the time already guaranteeing you play around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru </a>and other random hand traps that are bad against Dino's engine but good against other deck engines like Ghost Belle. Then you access the Ogdoadic engine through the King of the Feral Imps and that's where comes why this engine works in the deck but for that I'll explain this story of the standard combo in more detail:  Oviraptor + Baby = Misc + Baby = Archosaur + Baby = Oviraptor + Misc In any of these combos you will get the following board: Oviraptor + Baby + Scrap Raptor + Archosaur (or Linkuriboh in the case of the Archosaur + Baby combo) + Double Evolution Pill in the Hand Now we are going to do the sequence: Scrap Raptor eff target itself --- Scrap Raptor gy effect to add Chimera ---NS Scrap Chimera and effect --- SS Scrap Raptor and make Evolzar Dolkka using Scrap Raptor and Oviraptor as material --- after you must do Linkuriboh because even if you don't need it to banish from gy with the Double Evolution Pill it is important because it has the Dark attribute to be banned by Chaos Ruler.  Then you Link Summon <a data-name=""Scrap Wyvern"">Scrap Wyvern</a> with Linkuriboh and Chimera and make the standard Scrap Raptor summon from the deck and destroy the Babycerasaurus that will bring the Giant Rex. Here you can choose to play safe and make <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> to add <a data-name=""Nauya"">Nauya </a>to your hand because he is the best starter of the Ogdoadic engine. Or go for a more aggressive play and do Chaos Ruler which aims to get mill o Nauya or <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu </a>or any combination of <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt </a>+ any Reptile monster. Using the example of King of the Feral Imps after adding Nauya to the hand we will use his effect and send Keurse to the GY and that way the basic Ogdoadic combo can happen with <a data-name=""Keurse"">Keurse </a>taxing the King of the Feral Imps and bringing back Nauya to the field for the second effect which will add the <a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a> to the hand and we will use that to send Aleirtt to the GY. Finally Aleirtt will tax the banished Nauya and enter the field activating the second very important effect of returning two banished monsters to the gy including a Reptile monster so we will return the <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus </a>to the gy in our turn and make <a data-name=""Number 38"">Number 38</a> or <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu </a>with both level 8 bodies on the field and now we use the Double Evolution Pill to bring Tyranno to the field and Giant Rex back to be the monster to be destroyed with Tyranno's effect. The final board will be: Tyranno + Dolkka + Giant Rex + Scrap Wyvern + Number 38 or Dingirsu. Most of the time I choose Number 38 as the final board but <a data-name=""Number 68"">Number 68</a> is also very good and Dingirsu i make in the first turn when you know you are facing trap decks because the way a trap deck breaks your field is by destroying your cards and Dingirsu prevents this from happen. This combo is unorthodox and you can try other ways to do it because while Chaos Ruler has the advantage of being used as xyz material and you may not need to add a Reptile to your hand depending on how good the mills are but add Oviraptor for the hand for example what does it mean to be an extra body in the grind game and have Oviraptor to follow up in hand or do the combo via King of the Feral Imps which allows you to access more Ogdoadic names in the GY which makes your own Grind Game on the part of this much better engine. But we can also do simpler combos like <strong>Nunu + any Lv4 Dino = I:P Masquerena + Aron</strong>. This combo is interesting because you can risk opening with Giant Rex or Miscellaneousaurs + <a data-name=""Nunu"">Nunu </a>you use the two effects of Nunu and you will have her on the field when you give NS Dino Lv4 and you continue with <a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a> combo like me already I mentioned but here how you will have done <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> when activating the <a data-name=""Ogdoadic Water Lily"">Ogdoadic Water Lily</a> you will have 4 Reptiles in the GY so you can reborn a Reptile to the field in the resolution and that will be <a data-name=""Aron, the Ogdoadic King"">Aron, the Ogdoadic King</a> who will be able to use his two effects on opponent's turn being one of discarding a card from his hand after he adds something and another of adding a Reptile from the deck or gy to the hand if he sees an opponent's monster being sent to the gy such as when he does Link Summon and this is important because you will have <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> discard cost paid without using other cards from your hand or discarding another card from your hand but at least having a normal summon next turn to make Ogdoadic plays again. In other words, this end board seems little but it's actually decent to do. Other combos I noticed with the deck: <strong>Nauya + any monster = Number 97 or Number 38</strong>. This is good if for example you give NS Ovirapor and the opponent denies it to extend moves and pass with something that guarantees you to survive. <strong>Snake Rain + Discard = Numeron Dragon OTK and Ogdoadic Spell/Trap in Hand</strong> Or <strong>Snake Rain + Discard = I:P Masquerena + Aron</strong> - exactly the same combo as Nunu + any Lv4 Dino only changing the beginning as you don't need to spend Normal Summon which means if your opponent clears your field a single Snake Rain will be or a Rank 8 or that I:P Masquerena + Aron combo. <strong>Scrap Raptor = Rank 8</strong> - Here you can extend a little Scrap Raptor play to access some Ogoadic cards and pass with an Rank 8 and good Ogdoadic names in the GY. <strong>Archosaur + Giant Rex or Miscellaneousaurus = Rank 8</strong>. In this example instead of adding the Double Evolution Pill you add Nauya and make the default Nauya + any monster combo. <strong>Oviraptor + Double Evolution Pill = Tyranno + Rank 8 + Misc in GY</strong> - Again we are going to use the <a data-name=""Archosaur"">Archosaur </a>to add the Nauya to the hand but this time we need the Double Evolution Pill to get a Reptile out of the GY before using the effect of <a data-name=""Aleirtt"">Aleirtt </a>to return Misc to the GY and that way we make a decent pitch while keeping a lot of great follow ups.  <strong>Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Chaos Ruler ROTA = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Aron + Number 38</strong> - Here you open with Combo plus Nunu and as this Oviraptor will most likely take hand trap it makes sense to ensure you have some play starting using Nunu's two effects and that way you are obliged to start the combo by doing King of the Feral Imps however the only difference on the end board will be that you don't have access to the Giant Rex unless you mill it with Chaos Ruler eff. In this combo you will be able to make Chaos Ruler using a Scrap Raptor and a Nauya that will be reborn with Keurse and this Chaos Ruler comes back from the gy to make a Rank 8.  <strong>Oviraptor + Baby + Nunu Combo with the Borreload Savage ROTA = Tyranno + I:P Masquerena + Borreload Savage + Rank 8</strong> - Here you do Savage instead of Chaos Ruler but I prefer the other final board because Chaos Ruler as part of your follow up is really good.  <strong>Oviraptor + Baby + Nauya Combo with Chaos Ruler ROTA = Tyranno + Dolkka + Wyvern + I:P Masquerena + Number 38</strong> - These combos you play as Dino normally having access to Dolkka on the end board different from the combo made with Nunu so you get a lot more interactions.  <strong>Ovirapor + Baby + Nauya Combo with Borreload Savage ROTA = Tyranno + Dolkka + Borreload Savage + Number 38</strong>  <strong>Snake Rain + Scrap Raptor = I:P Masquerena + Bagooska /in GY: Chaos Ruler + all the Ogdoadic names /in Hand: Search of Chaos Ruler</strong> - Again this Chaos Ruler will be done after summoning Nauya with Keurse and after doing I:P Masquerena you will have the Scrap Chimera on the field so the spell Ogdoadic Water Lily will summon from any lv4 Reptile to make Bagooska.  <strong>Snake Rain + Oviraptor the 3 possible situations</strong>: First: Archosaur add Double Evolution Pill and make Linkuriboh + I:P Masquerena /in Hand: Double Evolution Pill + Ogdoadic Water Lily /in GY: Misc + 3 ogdoadic names Second: add Misc and don't use it and passes with I:P Masquerena + Aron /in Hand: Ogdoadic Monster added with King of the Feral Imps + Miscellaneousaurus.  Third: Use Archosaur to add an Ogdoadic name and pass with I:P + Bagooska /in GY: Misc and all the Ogdoadic names. This combo is also possible if the Snake Rain discard is a Reptile so you can add the Pill straight to the hand which is much better.  These were the ideas I had so far about synergies between the deck's engines and I consider this a deck with potential because it has several different lines of play that help a lot against hand traps and in the grind game."

(Original list: https://ygoprodeck.com/magistus-post-bode/) A lot of time has passed since my last update so here's a list to get people who are thinking of building this deck a few more lists to think about as BODE is right around the corner (4 days I believe?). Anyways this is going to be less in depth when compared to my old list since a lot of the reasonings/purpose of the cards remain the same as before. For the sake of ease, I'll be calling the Lvl4 Spellcasters with ED versions by these names (Verre for Rilliona Zoroa for Lvl4 Zoroa.) Likewise, the ED monsters are Rilliona for the XYZ and Daimon for Zoroa Synchro.  Description:  Magistus is a Spellcaster focused deck that focuses on the younger versions of your favorite spellcaster monsters.  List Time:  Magistus Engine (19 Cards - 12 Monsters 7 Spells)  Starters: Rilliona, Zoroa, Endymion  Extenders: Vrtira, Crowley, Trismagistus  3x Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre: The S/T Searcher for the deck. One of the 9 Starters (and the arguably worst one). It is the typically the target to search off Artemis if you already have Crowley in hand for followup.  3x Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame: Tuner of the deck. Serves as a starter as it can special summon another lv4 spellcaster from your hand/gy or attach Artemis to get to Crowley if you have spellcaster handtraps.  3x Endymion, the Magistus of Mastery:  Starter that gets to Artemis and allows you to cycle through your deck.  3x Crowley, the Magistus of Grimores:  Extender for the deck and typically the first choice of monster to grab off Artemis. His ability to change attributes comes up if you have two Crowleys on board for Rilliona XYZ (who needs two separate attributes) and for Toadally Awesome.  3x Vritra: Another extender which revives a Magistus from the GY. Typically the card you'll grab from Verre on your  3x Trismagistus: Serves as a soul charge and extender for monsters stuck in hand. Has battle protection for your Magistus monsters that are Equipped with an equip card.  1x Magistus Theurgy: Brought down from the two that I used to run. It's a nice card to have in hand/start off with but mostly serves as a way to make Rilliona a starter by itself.  Serves as an extender against Imper/Veiler for any of the starters. Can also flip in Game 1 if you equipped the wrong cards to Zoroa.  Generic Cards: x21  Hand-Traps: Droll &amp; Lock Bird, Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence  3x Droll &amp; Lock and 3x Veiler are really interesting HTs as they are also spellcasters. Going first opening multiple of drolls or uneeded veilers is fine as Crowley can discard these cards to special himself out.  3x Infinite Impermanence- I choose to run this to combat the upcoming meta however this is up to you and what you choose to run. It's a solid Hand-Trap either way as it counteract cards like TTT.  3x Pot of Desires: Draw 2 with all the important cards being 3 ofs. What more can I say?  2x Spell Power Mastery: Another 2 copies of Endymion. Adds to the consistency of this deck.  3x Triple Tactics Talents: A super strong going second or going first card. If you can't afford this feel free to run more handtraps.  1x Called by the Grave: Self-Explanatory card. Can negate a Hand-trap/card your opp uses.  3x Solemn Strike - A personal tech choice that I have. Strike is a really strong card to counteract your opponent and makes the Tenyi Swordsoul Matchup easier (Negates Vishuda).  Side Deck: (Modify to your locals)  Notable Cards are specifically Invocation and Secret Village of the Spellcasters.  Invocation is in the side rather the main deck as it's honestly a brick in the hand. Through my testing, I felt as making Aiwass was a waste of resources as it isn't a real proper negate and typically people side in backrow hate against Zoroa, so making Aiwass is less then worth it. That being said, It's sided for matchups that do not use the ED.  Secret Village - Best card of generic spellcaster support. Negates spell cards that your opponent has. Feel free to main it as well :).  Extra Deck: (going to just copy this from my old post)  2x Artemis - the best equip card that the deck has. It allows the search for any of our Magistus monsters that we need in hand.  1x Ninanruru - Our S/T removal other then cosmic. Can be useful to force activation of cards. Also has a nifty effect to allow two attacks on monsters.  1x Vahram - The main target to equip to Zoroa. Gives Zoroa a construct-like send and S/T protection. Also has a boardwipe effect that burns all face-up cards. Just like the fiery bird it is.  1x Aiwass - Our target for Fusion matchups. Can also be made with Invocation in matchups that don't use the ED. Don't forget the atk/def gain effect to hit over monsters.  2x Rilliona - Typically the card that allows the search for baby Zoroa. Allows us to consistently go into Zoroa. Remember that this card locks us into Magistus ED monsters. Also has a neat effect to negate a monster on your turn.  1x Zoroa, the Magistus of Daimon - Our main t1 board usually revolves around him. Important to realize that Zoroa says the cards don't have to be attached to him to do the floodgate effect and that Zoroa works no matter where the ED monster attempts to activate. Also has a neat reincarnation effect that becomes useful for plays later on and to reestablish the lock. Can be ran at 1 or 2 - up to your preference.  1x Bahmaut Shark/1x Toadally Awesome - fans of this deck already knows about these cards. You typically make this with Endmyion and Crowley (by changing Crowley to water). Another play to play around Nibiru or to have another negation on the board.  1x Halq/Selene/Accesscode - Standard Accesscode link climb combo. Make Halq with Zoroa and another monster then SS Veiler. Then link into Selene and revive another spellcaster. Then go into Accesscode. Typically the play that you will do to end the game.  1x Heartland Draco/Zeus: Heartland Draco has the ability to be able to attack directly to go into Zeus.

Look no further,"Keeping it simple, Keep your opponents monster to a minimum and use D Magician to beat over with help from his support cards. Traps manage problem spells and maintain D Magician.

Extra deck can be experimented with but so far its been okay...same with the side deck. Don't be afraid to recommend/update this deck. I wanted to make a deck where ectoplasmer and Malice Doll of Demise would be great contributors but without changing the deck to something completely different, essentially keeping the (Arkana) soul of the deck in tact, (no pun intended, looking at you Magician's Souls)."
