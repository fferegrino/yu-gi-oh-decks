This archetype is lacking, but I try to make it work! And this is my first involved variant of the deck. This variant has every starter in the book, it can play through a bunch of interruptions, has the least potential to brick, and is my only deck where I used Diviner. However, it's also in my opinion the one with the least potential, and probably the least interesting to me, quite fun still however. HOW TO USE DIVINER normal Diviner-&gt;dump Trias Hierarchia (this is why we play it)-&gt;activate Hierarchia from grave to tribute Diviner-&gt;Special summon Hierarchia-&gt;Diviner activates-&gt;special summon Cutea from deck-&gt;search.. Plus two!! Granted you have to give your normal summon for this but it's nice, and it gives you virtually six copies of your main searcher, (as well as the where arf thous) if you don't need the Cutea, you are free to summon your TUNER herald of orange light, or Dreamea. EXPLAINING SOME TECH OPTIONS -One for one: why are you running this in a pendulum deck? +This is a very good card to go even by special summoning cutea and pitching one of your effect monster starters, because we have a lot of those in this deck, you can even pitch Trias Hierarchia if you open it, and still get the effect later, so most of the time you want to be using this on your effect monsters that can special summon -Lyrilusc - Recital Starling +You can get into this extremely easily in this, the main purpose of this is to get you a Pendulumucho, a scale 0, can be very useful, it's also a winged beast that can go into Simorgh, Pendulumucho can retreive the jackal you threw into the grave to get Magicians' Souls OR you can detach Cutea and get her back to your extra deck instead! -Odd-eyes Arc Pendulum +Target for Duelist Alliance when you need a high scale -Halqifibrax +Very flexible card, lets you go into Selene with Effect Veiler, you can side into Mist Valley Baby Roc so it turns into a Simorgh, go into Diviner and tribute it if you can, or sometimes even go into Borrelsavage, but you get the gist, very strong card, and just comes in handy when usually nothing else would work out as well GENERAL GAMEPLAN what you want to accomplish with this deck is play to your hand, try to get Cutea to get the plus off of her, try to get to your 0 scale, otherwise just set whatever you can, go into your link first, off of your easy special summons, then pendulum summon and get as many monsters on the field, then look at your extra deck for plays, because you won't be getting anything from your maindeck for a while. With this deck you need to focus on getting past the second turn, once you're in your third turn, you can dismantle their board and OTK, so it's fine to dump a lot of resources into your first board, as long as you don't die OR lose your scales and have no replacement.

Dragunity remus is an extender which can also search a dragon ravine and it's a lvl. 2 tuner. With other words you have a 1 card crystal wing, which is also a card which let's you unbrick hands and it's a great follow-up play.</span>  <span>You only have to play 2 bricks in the deck which are legatus and baby roc, but that's completly fine, because even if you draw them they're not dead cards, legatus can be a free link/synchro material if dragon ravine is on the field and baby roc is a free discard for dragon ravine, so it actually doesn't matter. You could also play atum, dragunity glow, myseltain, and zephyros. The problem I have with them is that you would have to main deck more bricks just for a 2nd elpy and to loop gae daerg, which isn't worth it. </span>  <span>I also don't play red md just, because I never make him and don't even know why I would need him. The only 2 times I maked him was 1. I've bricked and had red md and a ns in hand, so I used him to go into romulus and the 2nd time I used him to get abyss back. With other words he is useless for me.</span>  <span>Another card I don't play is apollousa, just because I needed extra deck space for the gae daerg and crystal wing and I play saryuja instead, because 1. it is a dragon and remus locks you into dragons, 2. it can make you a better hand and 3. it can be used as a link material for spheres. </span>  <span>The last card I kicked was quadborrel, just because I don't have the space for that.</span>  <span>A card I would play is phantazmay, the thing is that I don't know what to cut for that, so if anyone has an idea let me know. :)</span>"

Universal Studios has chosen to move the movie premiere of ""Fast &amp; Furious 9"" to April next year.  The cause is the coronavirus, which is spreading concern around the world, and is expected to have a major impact on bio-revenues in the near future. The Bond film ""No Time to Die"" was recently moved to November, and the thriller ""A Quiet Place Part II"" will be postponed indefinitely. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayVia/comments/n74iua/retfærdighedens_ryttere/</a>  ""We all know the love and expectations for the next chapter in our saga. It is therefore especially difficult to tell that we have to move to the premiere. It has become clear that it will be impossible for all our fans around the world to see the film in May,"" comments Vin Diesel in social media. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/f9ukraine/comments/n720vt/фільм_форсаж_9_нестримна_сага_2021_онлайн/</a>  I think Cipher will be the enemy of the toretta in this part as well Statham and maybe his brother in the movie will be on the side of the team - they will continue to chase Cipher because as we know in the eighth installment she survived - Toretto has already destroyed her two teams so she won't let it go. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayVia/comments/n75hlq/centervagt/</a>  I wonder about the role of Matt Damon - Today Tyrese Gibson announced on Facebook that Matt Damon will appear in the 9th part :)  <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayVia/comments/n7jdcm/se_på_fast_furious_9/</a>  I also like Statham very much, thanks to him this series has gotten fresh, plus his lyrics for Hobbs and vice versa are great. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/fastandfurious9poland/comments/n7k97w/szybcy_i_wściekli_9_2021_cały_film_pl/</a>"

The best, but very inconsistent combo that deck allows is this.  If you get Malefic Stardust in you opening hand without Territory, and you have something else you'd rather play like a Malefic Rainbow or Cyber End, then ideally summon the stardust BEFORE bringing out Malefic World so that you can have a normal Stardust banished for Later.  (Worth noting that if you have a selector and are trying to get territory. but you nothing in your GY, summon Malefic monsters so you have banish fodder. Then bring out Territory and a Malefic of your choice)  Once you are able to get Territory out, use Malefic World's ability during your next draw phase to get Paradigm in your hand (if you can, use Malefic World to get selector instead so that you can get an extra card on top of Paradigm). Then summon Paradigm and activate his effect. By sending Paradox Gear to the Graveyard you can Get the regular Stardust back from your banish pile in addition to any other Malefics you have. This is a free negate to keep your beatsticks from being destroyed.  Against Synchro decks, make an effort to use Paradox Gear to get Paradox Dragon out, which you can use to steal a Synchro from their Graveyard."

Each time you summon another shining attack points for every shining will rise making it really strong. The other fusion heroes are if you can't do the combo so use them only if you need to. Favorite hero card will also further boost attack points. The whole deck is about making shining stronger. Also if you have both sunrise and another hero and you or you opponent attacks sunrise can destroy a card on the fiel,d use it to protect shining. If you want to exchange hero signal with another card, i recommend change of hero-reflector ray if you want more hero traps in the deck."

And now it is not long until the sequel comes, certainly longed for by many. ""A Quiet Place Part II"" was supposed to be released as early as March 2020, but became one of the first films to fall victim to covid-19 and closed cinemas. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/theconjuring3ita/comments/n69lg7/the_conjuring_per_ordine_del_diavolo_2021/</a>  Following the deadly events at home, the Abbott family must now face the dangers of the outside world as they continue their struggle for survival in silence. When forced to venture into the unknown, they quickly realize that the creatures that respond to sound are not the only threats lurking beyond the sandy path. Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy, Noah Jupe and Djimon Hiunsou play the lead roles. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/lucaita/comments/n68fk9/luca_streaming_ita/</a>  It may be too early to say that it's starting to become a trend, but soon a comedy film by Blue Fox Entertainment will premiere called ""Hero Mode"", which is also about a game studio. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/ElConjuro3/comments/n6cc99/ver_el_conjuro_3_el_diablo_me_obligó_a_hacerlo/</a>  The film revolves around a struggling indie game studio, which is suddenly successful when the boss's teenage son, who is good at programming, is given responsibility for the development. However, this makes the already employed, including one played by Sean Astin (best known as Sam in the ""The Tale of the Ring"" movies), somewhat dissatisfied. <a>https://sites.google.com/view/conjuring3hebrew/home</a>  The film is directed and produced by the relatively unknown A.J. Tesler. In my opinion, it seems to have potential with its rather different premise, as long as the game theme does not feel glued or forced. <a>https://www.reddit.com/r/Unhommeencolere/comments/n6fems/regarder_un_homme_en_colère_2021_streaming_vf/</a>"

A negate, a board wipe, and very likely Eldlich access.  <em><strong>The Nunu and Nauya open respecting Nibiru</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Activate Nunu effect, send Aleirtt</li>  	<li>Activate Nauya effect, send Keurse</li>  	<li>Special Nunu with it's effect, and tribute it for Keurse</li>  	<li>Special Nauya from Keurse effect and add Water Lily</li>  	<li>Tribute Nauya for Aleirtt, and use Aleirtt effect to return Nauya and Nunu to grave</li>  	<li>Overlay for Rank 8 of choice</li>  	<li>Go cry to mommy because you made a sub par play due to a crippling fear of rocks</li> </ol> It plays around Nibiru and you end with a negate. Oh, and I guess Eldlich access if you drew the right cards.  This particular combo does demonstrate the loop I referred to though, using Aleirtt to ensure access to your engine next turn and have access to Ogdoabyss on the follow up with Water Lily once your single negate is destroyed and your opponent fails to OTK.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>The Nunu+Zohah open</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Discard Nunu, send Aleirtt</li>  	<li>Normal summon Zohah, Special Nunu from grave</li>  	<li>Overlay for King of the Feral Imps, using the effect to add Nauya</li>  	<li>Activate Nauya sending Keurse</li>  	<li>Tribute King of the Feral imps for Keurse</li>  	<li>Special Nauya off of Keurse, and add Water Lily to hand off of Nauya's effect</li>  	<li>Activate Water Lily here, sending Ogdoabyss which will be your 5th reptile in grave and then Special Summon it</li>  	<li>Tribute Nauya for Aleirtt, it will be banished until you can bring it back next turn, no way to play around that which is why Activating Water Lily was important.</li>  	<li>Overlay for rank 8 of choice</li>  	<li>Activate Zohah's gy effect to discard any card in your hand (like a useless/dead golden land trap)</li> </ol> Combo 2 of ideal end board, no real way to play around Nibiru  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Nauya and Zoha open</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Activate Nauya and send Keurse</li>  	<li>Normal Summon Zohah, and tribute it for Keurse, and special from Keurse's effect Nauya</li>  	<li>Resolve Nauya by adding Water Lily, resolve Zohah's effect by adding Null and discarding an unwanted card.</li>  	<li>Activate Null and send Aleirtt</li>  	<li>Special Null with it's own effect and overlay into King of the Feral Imps</li>  	<li>Activate King of the Feral imps getting another Null for next turn</li>  	<li>Tribute King of the Feral Imps for Aleirtt, having no cards banished</li>  	<li>Overlay for rank 8 of choice</li>  	<li>Activate Water Lily, send Ogdoabyss, it will be the 6th reptile in grave, Special summon it</li>  	<li>Activate Zohah effect to get any other unneeded cards into the grave yard</li> </ol> Full Combo, possible lord access and it doesn't leave a card banished.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Nunu</strong></em> <ol>  	<li>Activate Nunu sending Zohah</li>  	<li>Activate Zohah's gy effect discarding a card to add it to your hand.  you REALLY want to discard one of the tribute monsters here, the dream scenario is one of the 2 Aleirtt's or the one Ogdoabyss.  Queen is also not a bad option.</li>  	<li>Normal summon Zohah and special Nunu with its own effect</li>  	<li>Overlay for King of the feral, activate effect for Nauya</li>  	<li>Activate Nauya send Keurse</li>  	<li>Tribute King of the Feral Imps for Keurse, special Nauya and add Water Lily</li>  	<li>Activate Water Lily, send either Aleirtt or Ogdoabyss here depending on what you did during step 2.  If you did not discard a tribute monster, send Aleirtt.  Special Ogdoabyss if possible</li>  	<li>Tribute Nauya for Aleirtt, it will stay banished.</li>  	<li>Overlay for rank 8 of choice</li> </ol> <em><strong>Snake Rain open</strong></em>  There isn't really a specific snake rain combo , it's basically what you see above but better.  I will offer a tip though, don't just throw down snake rain.  Start going through some of these combos, activate Cursed Eldland if you have it, just try to draw out any Ash that may be lurking in your opponents hand, because ensuring Snake Rain resolves boosts your chances of winning significantly......obviously.  &nbsp;  <em><strong>Eldlich Open</strong></em>  It's Eldlich, set traps and proceed to Monkee Flip.  One note though, it's a pretty small Eldlich package, there's no need to ever activate more than 1 Golden Land effect in EP, you're just making yourself more susceptible to back row removal.  ____  It's important to remember that a lot of these combos only require having 2 cards in hand, and bare minimum you only need 1.  It's very likely you open full Ogdoadic combo and will have access to the Golden Boy.  The boards may seem underwhelming but consistently ending on a board wipe before your opponent has even played a card is incredibly powerful, you have a chance to stop your opponents turn before it even started and give yourself all the momentum in the duel, and you will be able to do it 3 turns in a row minimum.  The amount of advantage you can generate with this deck is insane, and it will be put to good use.  Pure Advantage Snakes Munch all Noobs.  &nbsp;  Don't mind the side deck too much, you can very easily replace the Droplets with some Imperms, they're in the side currently because I don't have to pay 400 dollars for 3 cards in the side deck for a deck I've only played online.  Nibiru and Lancea are alternate Hand traps to consider, but Belle in the main deck is a must as it is your primary protection against banishing effects and other graveyard shenanigans your opponent might try.  &nbsp;  I have been playing this deck almost exclusively for 2 months and I believe this deck will be Meta, just not sure where exactly it will end up on a tier list, or if this <em><strong>exact</strong></em> list is the way to go.  Also an Eldlich deck so that allows me to say it's Meta apparently."

","This is a re-upload of a deck I posted in February, back when snake lily wasn't revealed yet, and after month of playtesting. Some elements have changed since, but the core strategy is still the same.  The deck now has some potential going first thanks to snake lily and cards like Hyperyton, but you still prefer to go second since your otk options are very easy to access.  The idea is to injure the opponents board with strong equalizers before spamming your field with reptiles and accessing your Xyz 8 toolbox to OTK. Curse and Aleth make it easy with snake rain ( or just Nunu and another Ogdoadic ) so you can end game quickly with Numeron Dragon. If you can't otk that turn, then setup the ogdoadic king/queen/overlord or Zeus to disrupt your opponent's follow up.  Lair of darkness is insane in this deck and so is Darkest Diabolos. You can tribute your opponent's monster to summon yours from the graveyard , which bypasses almost every kind of protection. It's one of the easier ways to get rid of problematic cards. Even Arima is nice, not only because it searches Lair, but it's effect is actually useful, on top of being a lvl4 : you can search Nihil, Nessie, Jackalope or Diabolos depending on what you need.  Lamia and Hydra are nice little engine that clears boards and gives you cards to work with. It doesn't interact well with targeting protection though. Echidna is situational and be careful with her, as her search effect prevents you from going into your Rank 8.  Dangers are here for ""consistency"" and they open up Xyz play. Its weird to speak about consistency with danger!s but that's what they actually do here, kind of how they did in Thunder dragon back in the days. There is just no better equivalent to ""extenders that load the graveyard and cycle through the deck"" and you need all of that. Tsuchinoko is searchable with King of the Feral Imp or Echidna, which is actually very relevant because one more monster can be crucial to tribute for your Ogdoadic graveyard summons.  If you don't open your equalizers, try baiting as much negates as you can, you will see that you can go through much.  The side deck is just good going second cards, but you can put whatever you like as long as you can break boards. Careful with the barrier statue of the wind, as you will need the wind insect kaiju to out it as Gameciel don't work. Be sure to pack Backrow hate as that kind of deck can become akward to deal with. Viruses can also be considered in the side for going first.  Some changes that can be considered : <ul>  	<li>Teardrop the Rikka queen can be played instead of Hyperyton. She's less powerful but she can be made without tributing Strenae if need be.</li>  	<li>Hieratic dragon overlord of Heliopolis ( instead of Dingirsu ) is very good if Lair is on the field, but only ok without. Also the fact that it detaches a material matters compared to dingirsu, as it makes your recusive loop accessible on the following turn.</li>  	<li>The whole Galaxy cipher dragon Xyz package is good but redundant with hydra and lamia. Some cute things you can do is using muddy mudragon to fuse the  Galaxy-eyes cipher ex dragon that is on top of a monster stolen by the og cipher dragon into a red-eyes dark dragoon.</li>  	<li>a Dragoon pakage because why not ?</li>  	<li>some good rank4 like Abyss Dweller</li>  	<li>most handtraps are changeable, but some have extra synergy : Gamma on your own turn is godlike as it puts 2 monsters on your field, ready to get tributed for your ogdoadics. Nibiru also leaves a monster on your field which is very appreciated.</li> </ul> Weakness to droll&amp;lockbird,  Skullmeister, Ghost Belle and backrow heavy decks. Abyss Dweller is an auto lose if you don't draw gamma or imperm.  Let me know in the comments if you would make any changes or if I missed some cool interactions ! Enjoy !"

The deck is organic but definitely a smidge on the luck-based side, what ","Here it is, the culmination of all my experience playing Dangers, Kaijus, and board-breaking decks in general. For your consideration, I present to you;  Danger Kaijus; The Rank 8 Specialists  So, let's review; obviously this deck will not be *as* good against a backrow-oriented deck on the first round. That said, if back-row is all they have, between Bigfoot, Thunderbird, and your extra deck (which contains my old friend Heliopolis! :D blow up ALL the things!), you can take out a decent chunk of their resistance before you go neck-deep into your main play.  What is the main play, you ask? Why, XYZ summoning into a Draglubion OTK of course. &gt;:) I personally enjoy going into a Rank 4 support card like Daigusto Emeral or Dugares to help your resource management and pad the amount of Ranks on the board, then do the thing, because this guarantees a Number 100 with at least 13,000 attack which can OTK over any of your Kaijus. If you have enough for an extra Rank 8 first, you could also go into some hand trap insurance, like Photon Lord or Dingirsu (for destruction effects, specifically). And from there, the strategy is more or less as it always has been; Go second, break whatever board they have over your knee, preferably with a sickening snap, and run them over with the lorgest of lads.  Seriously, while I haven't been able to test it in person, I've been playing a lot of Dueling Nexus and the deck's performed admirably, especially for a deck that relies so heavily on luck and the gods of RNG. There's a heap of draw, a fair bit of recycling, and a great extra deck toolbox to handle a wide variety of situations. The side deck is based almost entirely on specific match-ups. The back-row hate is for Sky Strikers and other back-row oriented decks, the Jinzos are for freaking Elditch. Dark Ruler No More is in there for the same reason the C Tachyon is; just seems like a generally reliable choice when attempting to shut down a board that's beyond even our ability to outright blow the heck up, or if there are shenanigans afoot with monsters who have specific immunities. There Can Be Only One still pulls it's weight admirably after all this time, and the Virus... Ok, so look. Full Force Virus is basically a filler until I do more testing. That could be any Virus. Or any other two cards. But Full Force felt like a nice one to hit combo starters, monster-based hand traps, and other kinds of strategies out of the hand before they become a problem.  So that's it. That's the entire deck laid bare before us. Hope you like it. :)"

Have you ever been frustrated with the lack of penguins and giant monsters comprising the board state? Well no more! &gt;:) Introducing; Penguins! Warning: Penguins may contain elements of generic water support. Penguins may also emphasize a hard lean against hand traps. Please consult your dueling physician before using Penguins.  Heh, so, this deck has a couple different minor combo routes, centered around either Genex Undine/Rosenyx plays (going into Halq and having a pretty neat go-second board that can end on either Savage Dragon or Sigma on your opponent's turn, ideally after bouncing something to their hand as disruption and discarding a card from their hand with Locust) or the Kaiju boardwipe into Great Emperor Noot, into Nopenguin/Glacial Beast, which turns into Brave/Nope/any face down penguin you'd like. That's off of a board wipe. We have fun here. It's definitely not meta, but it does pack a bit of a punch especially against monster-oriented decks. Less so vs back-row heavy stuff, hence the sideboard, and if the opponent has monsters that can disregard being tributed or targeted, or they like to make a nasty board that one kaiju simply won't deal with, sometimes the only answer is to nuke it from orbit, just to be sure (i.e. more board wipes).  Haven't gotten to test it yet in any actual events for obvious and depressing reasons, but I look forward to having the opportunity for it."

This deck rarely ever bricks, and(Just like another FUN fusion spell we all know and...love?) fossil fusion allows you to use your opponent's monsters in the GY and when you do, gives the monster targeting protection. And when your fusion is destroyed, you can add it back to your hand to fusion all over again.

This deck is shit ,"This is the superheavy samurai deck profile. Its main combo pieces are soulpiercer and scarecrow, which can get you GY spell/trap steals that are banished when you use them, or steam king, which can banish all spells/traps in the GYs and deal some sick burn.  The usual combo is here: SHS Soulpiercer and either SHS Scales or SHS Trumpeter <ol>  	<li>Normal Summon Soulpiercer and link into SHS Scarecrow. Activate Soulpiercer's effect to search the piece you are missing(Either Scales or Trumpeter).</li>  	<li>Activate Scarecrow's effect to discard Scales to special scales from the GY. Next activate Scale's effect to special Soulpiercer from GY.</li>  	<li>Special Summon Trumpeter(There are 2 things you can do) and synchro summon SHS Ogre Shutendoji(An added bonus is that you can put more Spells/Traps in the GY).</li>  	<li>Activate Soulpiercer's effect(Yes, it isn't OPT. Nice, huh?) to search a second copy of trumpeter and special summon it. Then synchro summon SHS Steam Train King.</li>  	<li>OR(This is the second thing) when you ss trumpeter, you can instead synchro summon SHS Warlord Susanowo.</li> </ol> Welp, this deck doesn't really have other combos that don't give the same result, so i'll see you later. Here's the video, sry for being late.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXWTDWEfMUc&amp;t=30s  May 2021 SHS Deck. This deck is shit only because it can't run Spell/Traps. But that's jut my opinion.

Rikka, Sunavalon. ","Warning: Not a good deck. Just my current reference building point towards something.  The current build of this deck is using 60 cards, but I'm work this down to 40-42. I saw something interesting numbers at 41. I'm going to ignore that and take my building of this deck 1 step at a time.  The idea of this deck build came to me, when I realize Water is pretty grindy attribute. Rikkas are already a pretty grindy deck. Not the best grindy deck. Definitely not the best grindy deck out of the box that it came out of. I just saw something interesting if I fuel its grindiness.  First off. Rikka is the core. It's archetype has some pretty interesting mechanics. It is still missing cards imo.  Rikkas role as the heart of the deck is be a surprise deck. That is all. Played a few people at my locals. Just... not alot of people know what youre doing. They usually have to shotgun the cards they know.  Generaiders. I'm actually going to cut Harr and Spell/traps. With the current 60 card count. They're unreliable. Mardel's search effect is way to important, to use on another Generaider card. Mardel, herself, is abit of pain due her lv9 status. But since Mardel can search plants and give me access to Rank 9 plays. SHE STAYS!  Sunavalon: They actually provide some pretty good options. They can interact with GY. Provide Link fodder for Jasmine plays. Shrine is pretty interesting. Alittle short of insane. I don't think alot people understand the borderline broken effect it has. It allows me to re-set any Continuous Trap in my GY. Due to that. I don't need 3 copies of the very restrictive Bloom. And then there's the SS2 lingering effect on Bloom. If you play Sunavalon; Always consider Zepyhros.  Cutting down both Sunseed's from 3 to 2(or 1).  Draw Cards: I'm playing way too many. But that's the point. Moray can be used whenever you meet its cost. Jack-in-the Hand, can help dig out a lv1 for plays or incentivize getting a lv1 plant in the GY. Salvage helps keep your Rikka targets out of the GY and load your hand. I won't say its a plus 1. But if Mudan is a target can lead to extra advantage. Prosperity will be very powerful, when I fine tune the extra deck for the right targets. I will safely help me further dig into my deck.  One for One. Self explanatory.  Pollinosis is a placeholder. I'm just a fan of the card and how it can play with the Rikka tribute mechanic. Like, popping a Strenna, to go into another Teardrop or Kanzashi or... Treebeast.  Torrential is just a package I added as a placeholder. I can switch between a Raigeki package and Harpie's FD package.  Extra Deck is pretty basic. Its focused on Rikka and Sunavalon. With Rikka's being more board control and aggro and Sunavalon [Thrasher] being the donkey puncher. Again with the Bloom. If Bloom can stick, with the Lv4 Link and Thrasher, It's actually pretty much game over.  Missing items: Evil Thorn and Lonefire Blossom. I know they're staples. And I have already got my eye on what needs to go bring them in. Also, missing other staple plants like Rose Girl. Spore, if I add a Synchro target. Carrotweight.  Hand Traps: I'm balancing between 3-6 spots. If I go with 4, I will be going with the Psy-Frame or a Artifact package.  I am also looking into using Formud Skipper and Parallel Exceed. But I almost feel like I will lose the identity of the deck and also, if I start going down the cyberse road. Accesscode Talker wont be too far from the next exit."

Haven't seen one like this on here in a while so figured I'd share since it rends to be fairly effective.  I wouldn't touch any of the Dragonmaid ratios, since you really wanna open one of the main three. In general any 1 of the dragon maids guarantees you'll at least end on a Hieratic Seal, making bricking fairly difficult. You can lower Ernus by one if you wish. Chamber and Parlor can search/send a card to bring them back from the GY and then be linked away for a link 1 and brought back for the Seal. Kitchen and Nurse ask that you have at least one extender card in your hand. You generally wanna end with a Hieratic Seal or Sheou on the field and a couple backrows. The deck can consitently have 2-4 bounce/negate/destruction effects during your opponents turn, an a banish or two depending on what sort of backrow you drew. Don't forget that your big Dragons have in hand effects (Ernus can be an extender, but perhaps a better use is to summon chamber during your opponent's first turn to get a free search before your turn starts, and Tinkheck lets you easily attack over a lot of big monsters who might be problematic otherwise). Play whatever handtraps you want.  Spells and traps are also fairly simple and I don't think they need to be shuffled around. Dragonmaid Welcome and Dragonmaid Downtime are such amazing cards that basically guarantee you'll have a full hand at all times. With Sheou, a chamber in the GY and Downtime on the field you can search twice per turn, both your own and your opponent's. Dragonmaid Changerover at one is something to consider changing. You can search it, but drawing it is really convenient, and god help you if that one copy gets banished. Replace the one World Legacy Guardragon with a Monster Reborn. For the non-Dragonmaid traps, play whatever you want, the set I'm using there just happens to be my preference.  Extra deck can be whatever. I'd only advise to absolutely play Seal at 3. It does so much for the deck and the non-targeting, non-destruction removal is just a life saver. I'm paranoid about grind games so I play the Dragonmaid extra decks at 3 both but it's probably not necessary, especially since Sheou shuffles itself back. Link 1s are important for those weak hands I mentioned at the start. Guardargons can technically be used for a play but I only ever use them as Pot of Prosperity fodder.  &nbsp;  That's about it. As I said the deck itself is really simple and it should be obvious what to do. It manages its resources really well, especially the moment a Sheou is on the field so you generally can just keep going once you set up your first board. This is the first deck I've submitted so please feel free to criticize the heck out of it."
