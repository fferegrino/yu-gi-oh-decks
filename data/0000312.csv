The new support from Purrely Lily and Purrely Sleepy Memory should give the archetype more consistency, and sprights will just add some negates and extra swarming capability. Unfortunately, most Purrely cards won't be released until Amazing Defenders comes out next month, and I don't know when we'll see Lily arrive, so this deck won't be playable in the TCG for a while.

So that's the reason I'm forcing myself to run the Card Knight and E-Hero normal Mons. I've chosen those specifically because, fun fact, apparently Burstinatrix is the only non-Pend Normal FIRE Warrior monster in the game. And because the tournament has a rule about Normal Pend monsters counting as spells for the purposes of the even split, I've resorted to having the others be LIGHT Warrior monsters instead. Aside from a few Spells/Traps and Monster Effects that fuck with Monster Types, this shouldn't be prove important and I just went with being thematic.

Gagaga Child is important going first because if Utopic Onomatopoeia is negated then i can special summon Bancho and gagaga child from hand by their own effs, so gagaga child is strenghthening the whole onomat engine.</p><p>Her effect about conducting battle phase doesn't bother me because going first there is no batle phase, and if i am going second i am not looking for her, my key monsters for going second to help in breaking a board are Utopic Onomatopoeia, Bancho, Armed/Ascended/Zexal construct/Reinforcement and onomat spells. Astraltopia and kuriboh are just boosting the engine with reis map and pot. Even if i have gagaga child in my hand going second it's not bothering any of my combos and is not problem, but the important fact is that thanks to her onomat engine is boosted going first, it's much stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The strongest cards in the deck are Ascended/Armed sage with utopia double because they trigger chain link, that chain link makes cards such as veiller useless because you can chain with utopia double and resolve all your effs.</p><p>Important: Zs Utopic Sage is very risky to be played because is easy target for negate and u would end on very weak board if he is negated, that's why i use him in specific combos or in very powerful combos that can withstand negates in the process and make a good board even if he was negated.</p><p>Why i don't play utopic future draco? It takes too much space, i need to risk playing zs utopic sage too, the strategy to play draco can't withstand negates in the process so is risky and the board i would have if i play draco is: dragonar + leo equiped + draco + number 38 or 90.&nbsp;</p><p>If i don't play Draco, my board is: Dragonar + leo equiped + abyss dweller + number 38 or 90, i consider that stronger board, i have extra space too and the strategy to make that board is much safer and even it can withstand negates in that process, so competitively speaking i don't need draco.</p><p>About Dragonic ray, the most of the players doesn't know how to play him, if opponent succeed in negating utopia double then u can summon in his turn dragonic 5000ATK, if the opponent target him u can either support him with pegasus or either make him not targetable by tornado, it's hard combo to deal with, if the opponent doesn't have card like droplet then he need to use his entire hand to counter all of that.</p><p>Utopic future slash + downerd magician are used for ZEUS with 6 materials, yea, Zeus with 6 materials is crazy powerful and is worth it, if u combine it with the board breakers/forcing negate cards that i have in main deck, there is no board that i can't break.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MASTER DUEL:</p><p>If you don't have Astral Kuriboh then replace him with Brigandine.</p><p>I play 3 droplet, impermanence and chalice but you can play mix whatever you have, between Chalice, Impermanence, droplet, kaiju, dark ruler, lightning storm, raigeki. I can't recommend you Ash or Maxx C because these can be played only in your first draw of 5 cards, if you like them you can play them but keep in mind the fact that you can play such cards only in your first draw of 5 cards.</p><p>Time thief redoader is used only going second, he is good with Zeus, however, you can replace him with whatever you have, if you want to get something cheap in price but strong then number 89 diablosis is good option.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BUDGET VERSION:</p><p>Cut Droplet and you are ready to go :D . U can replace it with dark ruler for example.</p><p>You can replace Kuriboh with Brigandine.</p><p>You can cut crossout designator too.</p><p>Until here i think is enough with the budget version, but if your budget is still low then you can replace number 90 with number 23 or 22.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COMBOS:</p><p>onomat monster + onomat spell ///// Onomatopaira + Onomatopickup:</p><p>Going first, aim to get in hand Utopic + Bancho + GagagaChild.</p><p>Summon Utopic and use eff to special summon Bancho, special summon Gagaga Child with her own eff. Overlaw Utopic and Gagaga Child for Utopia Double and use eff to directly summon Dragonar. Use the eff of Bancho to special summon Utopic from gy and overlaw them for Abyss Dweller. In the opponent turn CHAIN LINK 1 Dragonar and CHAIN LINK 2 Abyss dweller then number 41 is summoned in defense, in that way your opponent can't use gy effs or monsters effs on the field. Note: When your turn comes number 41 is going in gy. After that you can attack with Dragonar and using him you can summon Utopic Slash and Downerd Magician for Zeus, so as follow up you have Abyss Dweller (1 material) and Zeus 3 materials. The Alternative board that you can make is Leo ray equiped + Abyss Dweller and the follow up is almost the same if you need zeus but this time it can be zeus 4 materials or if you don't need abyss dweller then use him for Zeus (2 materials).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dododowarf + Onomat Spell:</p><p>You need to discard dododowarf in gy, that's the most important in this combo.</p><p>The finished board that you can make is the same as the one explained above in the previous combo. The difference is that you don't play gagaga child in this combo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Onomat spell + Armed Sage:</p><p>The difference in this combo is that you can equip Tornado on leo ray or Dragonar. The finished board that you can make is the same as the one explained above in the previous combos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Onomat spell + Kuriboh:</p><p>Similar to the combos above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Onomat spell + Ascended Sage:</p><p>Special summon Ascended, add Bancho and Utopic, summon Utopic use eff to special summon Bancho, overlaw Ascended and Utopic for Utopia Double = Utopia = Prime = Dragonar. Bancho eff to special summon Utopic from gy and overlaw them for Abyss dweller. By Dragonar summon in your turn Leo Ray equiped pegasus, in opponent turn summon number 38 or number 90.&nbsp;</p><p>Finished board: Dragonar + Abyss Dweller + Leo Ray equiped Pegasus + Number 90 or 38</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Armed sage + Ascended ///// Zexal Construct + Sage:</p><p>In this combo be cautious with the chain links. Eff ascended chain link 1, eff armed chain link 2.</p><p>Summon Utopia Double = Utopia = Prime = Dragonar. By Dragonar in your turn summon leo ray equiped pegasus and tornado, in the opponent turn summon number 90 or 38.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reis Map + Zexal Construct/Ascended&nbsp;</p><p>Add Astraltopia in hand by reis map. The difference in this combo is that you can add in hand Onomatopaira as follow up for next turn, if you have in hand already onomatopaira then add onomatopickup. The finished board that you can make is the same as the one explained above in the previous combos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Onomat spell + Reis map:&nbsp;</p><p>Add dododowarf and discard him, keep in mind you can't use his eff but you can revive him by Bancho after you summoned him and Utopic Onomatopoeia and then go for zs utopic sage = ascended = Dragonar 4 material combos...</p><p>The reason why i discard dododwarf in gy is because the strategy can withstand negates in this way, but if i have other combo in hand beside reis map, for example onomat spell + sage, in this case when i add dododowarf by reis map i don't need to discard it in gy, instead i can summon him from hand by Utopic Onomatopoeia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why i don't play numbers protection? - That card is good only when you are going first, if you are going second that card is total brick, the deck is already very powerful going first so i don't need numbers protection, if i play astraltopia with sage i can add by astraltopia onomatopaira, if i have onomatopaira already then i can add onomatopickup as follow up for next turn. If i play Astraltopia + onomat spell then after i summon the onomat monsters on field i will go directly for utopia double and then special summon Astraltopia from hand, i will use eff chain link 1 astraltopia and chain link 2 utopia double,&nbsp; i am going to add by astraltopia Zexal construct&nbsp; and by zexal i will get hyper rank up to get to dragonar 4 materials safely, to go for dragonar 4 materials like every other combo utopia double = utopia = prime = dragonar. this combo is solid and can withstand negates in the process too -</p><p>- if astraltopia is negated then i can just go directly from utopia double to dragonar 2 materials and use him once to summon number 41 in defense, or the alternative board&nbsp; instead dragonar 2 materials is to directly summon Leo ray equiped.&nbsp;</p><p>All my combos in this deck are good enough to withstand negates in the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For going first i have crossout designator with nibiro and ash blosom with called by the grave.</p><p>Note: Be cautious how u use reis map, it must be the first card to be used in your turn.</p><p>That's enough writing...</p>"

Until then, I hope you're prepared to search an incredible amount, take advantage of the summon limit, and control the battlefield with pressure that makes control decks jealous of the hand advantage you can amass (although they've probably got us beat here when it comes to Traps and such-...) anyway here's the rundown of the new Dark Magician line-up!<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Snowball: You rack up advantage pretty quickly once you get going with this strategy. Between all of the layers of protection and nuance regarding the disruption lines on top of all of the means of searching from over a decade's worth of support? It's honestly difficult not to win after taking the lead.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Comeback Potential: Just having Illusion, Rod, Controlling the Dark Magician, or even just having Soul Servant in the GY during mid-to-late game will keep you in the game regardless of how things are going. Just don't play too zealously into something like a Trickstar Candina!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Rewarding Ceiling: While a lot of the early lines are pretty straightforward, most of the complexities with the archetype as a whole come from the usage of cards in tandem with one another. As opposed to early TCG builds where you kind of just drew cards and hoped it was enough to combo or amass a handtrap/backrow advantage, in Trinity, you'll be much more rewarded for your mastery of the cards at your disposal and how to best navigate the board you're dealt with or expecting. At times the pressure can be nigh suffocating from this deck.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Possible to Brick: Unlike its TCG counterpart, due to the nature of the format, DM can't exactly take advantage of so much deck-thinning and draw power and while some cards like the Spellbook engine would help with the cycling process a bit, they will always be setting you a turn behind and adding more additional cards to cycle through in the long run. A brick doesn't necessarily equate to your searchers and passing, it's more of the unplayable circumstances of drawing... all of the Dark Magicians and having no way of summoning them. Hence why we've got some backrow to fall back on and ways to cheat him out in the event of a crisis.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Bond Between Teacher and Student: This particular list makes great use of Dark Magician Girl and cards concerning her (without playing the Magician Girl archetype of course) and as amazing as the cards surrounding her are, she herself is terrible to use. You'll be wanting to bin her whenever possible or simply control her when under gamestates like Magician's Combination. There's even a cheeky setup concerning Brain Controll (or Big Eye) and using her as Xyz material to go into Dhampir Sheridan. All of those applications aside, she (and her Signature Spell) aren't that great and don't feel that great to have until necessary for certain combos.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Stat-Checked: If faced with too many monsters that are 3000 ATK/DEF or above you might run into a brick wall sometimes. Mahad can clear all things that are DARK and Apprentice can help the respective targets clear certain thresholds but most of the time those will be one use situations. Fortunately you can use Soul Servant to stack them from the GY to the top of deck for one final use.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With introductions over, let's get into the setups you'll want to seek seek more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />Thanks to all of the years of support this archetype has received it has gained a number of searchers and retroactive searchers to help boost its consistency and lines of play to be very reliable which is a massive boon when it comes to limited formats like this one. Generally, any starter will net you the same gamestate no matter what goes down; however, there are some combinations of 2 or more cards that do require a bit more setup. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Manju &amp; Senju: </strong>Opening one of these cards enables you to grab Illusion of Chaos (or Sauravis if you already have it) then search Magicians' Souls. Using Souls you'll want to setup your GY with either Mana to protect your plays going down the line or DM/DMG to establish them early and get them in rotation for the later stages of the game. Then you'll pivot into either Dharc or Lyna. With Dharc you can grab <strong>Magikuriboh </strong>and use it during that same battle phase (or main phase later) to summon a Dark M agician immediately, <strong>Witch of the Black Forest</strong> if you have particularly greedy setup lines to go for in future turns with fusion plays or revival, or simply <strong>Magician's Rod</strong> who is the best starter in the deck when combined with other cards in the strategy and it's not even close! As for Lyna, <strong>Witchcrafter Golem Aruru</strong> will be our primary find; however, <strong>Diviner of the Herald</strong> isn't particularly bad either. The reason why is below.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Diviner of the Herald:</strong> Using its effect to send, we'll pitch Arc Light from our Extra Deck to make it a Level 6 tuner, then we'll use Arc Light to grab Illusion of Chaos from the deck. Using Illusion, we'll pick up Magicians' Souls and send the appropriate targets like within the Manju &amp; Senju lines to the GY to summon it directly from the hand. Then we'll Synchro Summon itno <strong>Fortune Lady Every</strong>. This card being a Level 7 who revives itself and answers the board during the SP is very handy for Rank 7 lines and getting rid of pesky monsters. It's worth noting that her banish effect to bring herself back does come up in this deck so don't use it willy-nilly. Banishing Souls is fine, but everything else in this list definitely is not. Use it within moderation as her effect can be used even on turns where she wasn't sent to the GY since it checks during each of their End Phase's. If you happen to need Rod and have a usable S/T at your disposal, you can summon her back, then use that S/T to tribute her and add back the Magician's Rod at EP to start your turn with your primary searcher. Very handy indeed.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Magician's Rod:</strong> This card probably has the highest ceiling regarding its uses since now, with Illusion of Chaos, it can search the entire archetype and its support including adding Dark Magician to the hand when necessary. You may also want to (if on the second turn or later) Link it off into Clara &amp; Rushka so that during the opponent's turn, when you activate an S/T, you can tribute the link to add Rod back to hand. One line I like to particularly setup involves using it as fusion material for <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> by grabbing <strong>Secrets of Dark Magic</strong>, that way in the event that the Fusion would be destroyed and I have a S/T I can use, I'd usually tribute away the Dark Magician girl to recycle Rod for next turn. You can also go for some pretty devastating Bond Between Teacher and Student setups when going second (or later in the game) to nuke your opponent's S/Ts or Monsters. It was this particular line of play that actually winded up getting <strong>Dark Burning</strong> <strong>Magic </strong>banned here. Oops.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The majority of the time you'll want to stick to opening with one of these cards but if you happen to find yourself opening things like just DM or ways to him, it's still fine to cycle your respective S/Ts and support him as necessary. He's still the star of the deck and it's important to make sure you keep up your advantage until you can snowball the game out of controll.<br /><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br />This is where most games can end for you since the deck can swarm pretty decently after being setup or be rather controlling between Aruru and Mana being a devastating duo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Black Fang Magician: </strong>This card can be used to get over some pretty high walls or reach for lethal in addition to floating into cards like Apprentice, DM, Witch, and most interestingly <strong>Millennium-Eyes Restrict</strong>, <strong>The Dark</strong> <strong>Magicians</strong>, and <strong>Master of Chaos </strong>(unfortunately in the case of Master of Chaos it isn't too great but if you need the banish nuke then look no further). </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Eternal Soul: </strong>Don't flip this card too early without insurance, it immediately puts a target on itself and players usually try to remove it when its face-up every time. That said, it can revive DMs for free and search out your one-sided Heavy Storm whenever you want. Use it to secure a lead or establish one. The safest setup to use it under midgame is definitely when controlling <strong>The Dark Magicians</strong> fusion monster, since if Eternal Soul leaves, the fusion would be destroyed but still float into the master and student, ultimately not setting you too far behind.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Soul Servant: </strong>This card's GY effect is rather potent and is virtually unrivaled when it comes to Unlimited power cards in Trinity Format. You'll usually be resolving it to draw two; however, with this build it's possible to draw up to four cards naturally from this effect- and we play TWO copies. The most important things to note about the stacking (and not searching) effect is that you can use it during the EP of your opponent's turn to rig your next draw and <em>the fact that this card can stack cards from your GY to the top of the deck</em> which is very, very potent in a limited format. Don't forget this as it might save you when piloting the deck!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Should the game not end at this point and you find yourself in a complex, mind-boggling gamestate then you're probably going to want one of the following closers.<br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Dark Magician the Dragon Knight &amp; Eternal Soul: </strong>This combination is really rough to deal with, especially since S/T removal is very limited in Trinity, so if this is established you have virtually won. DMtDK is treated as DM so it can be revived by Eternal Soul and is constantly under its protection, additionally, Eternal Soul is protected by DMtDK's continuous effect, making this a really rough situation to navigate for the opponent in most cases. Additionally, since DMtDK is treated as DM, it works with the field spell <strong>Magician's Salvation</strong> and <strong>Magician's Combination</strong> so even something like a DMG can represent DMtDK coming back over and over while protecting said cards in the process. This card is a monster and needs to be respected when properly established.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Magician's Combination: </strong>Probably the most underrated support card this deck has at its disposal. You tag out your DM/DMG to their counterpart and negate any card or effect (just not the activation so no Damage Step shenanigans). Once the opponent has had enough and decides to blow up Combination, it even has a revenge effect to clear a card on their side of the field. You can also force this effect yourself with <strong>Timaeus the United</strong> <strong>Dragon</strong> and <strong>Magicians' Souls </strong>turning those plays into removal.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />Since the lines from the archetype itself are rather consistent, the deck can be easy to get started with, but might take a bit to get used to and master; however, it's usability allows a great deal of customizability to cater to most tech choices like Dragonmaids to establish DMtDK easier or SPYRAL to do Master Plan setups with Magicians' Souls. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:<br /><br /><em>The Eye of Timaeus, Chaos Creator, Magician of Dark Illusion, Noctovision Dragon, Mana Dragon Zimitron, Magician of Chaos, &amp; Chaos Form, Chicken Game, Destined Rivals, and Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous<br /></em><br />As always, if you've made it this far, thanks for checking this write-up out and combing over my iteration of the Dark Magician Starter. Once Chronicle Sorceress arrives you can rest assured that I'll be updating things with fresh lines and even more explosive combos since she increases the deck's consistency by a considerable margin. Until then, we'll just have to keep up a steady pace and recite the incantations of the ulimate wizard in terms of attack and defense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Major plus</p><p>Ash and Maxx C</p><p>Also requires little explanation. Drawing 30 is pretty cool and being able to negate your opponents crucial searches is pretty nice.</p><p>Foolish Burial</p><p>Send monster go brrrrr</p><p>Harpie's Feather Duster</p><p>Backrow Removal go brrrrr</p><p><strong>Combo</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Summon Recycler (Via drawing it, or searching it off of raptor and scrapyard) and use it to send one of Rosenix or Jet, use said monsters effect to summon a monster/token.</p><p>- Link 2 for Wyvern, use Wyvern's effect to summon a golem. (You need an alternate target to destroy if your opponent controls no cards, so sacrificing a spell/trap or Danger by setting/summoning it before you use the effect. Alternatively, if you drew foolish burial, you can send the other of Rosenix/Jet and use it.) Use Golem's effect to summon Recycler, Recycler then sends World Wand.</p><p>- Link with Golem and Recycler to make Lib, Lib then sets Succession. Use Succession to summon the golem, then the golem revives recycler again (golem and recycler are soft once per turns luckily). Recycler sends Harp Horror.</p><p>- Link 4 with Wyvern, Golem, and Recycler to make a 2400 ATK Apollusa.</p><p>Now here is where the combo can differentiate based one whether you have enough link material. 4 link material is optimal, but the orcust line can only produce 3 without the help of sending more of them to the GY via other methods like return, discarded by a danger, or foolish burial. So I will explain with and without enough material.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Enough Material (4+)</strong></p><p>- Banish Harp to summon Girsu, Girsu sends Knightmare.</p><p>- Banish Wand to summon Harp. The use Knightmare (target does not matter unless it is your opponents turn.) to send either Cymbal Skeleton or Gizmek Orochi. Which will use its effect to summon itself.</p><p>- Use all 4 monsters (Harp, Girsu, Orochi/Cymbal's Target, and your 4th monster.) to make Galatea and I:P. Galatea shuffles World Wand to set Crescendo.</p><p>You now have 3 monster negates, 1 omni negate that also banishes, an I:P into whatever you deem nessisary which also gives a non-target shuffle when Lib is used for it. An possibly hand traps, Babel, Forbidden Droplet, and Called by the Grave. A very formidable end board, and if your opponent can out it, you have tons of ways to recover that I won't explain here.</p><p><strong>Not Enough Material (&gt;4)</strong></p><p>Uh oh, this is a problem. Maybe you just got unlucky or messed up somewhere, either way your here, so we gotta do something. There are a few ways you can end you board with only 3 more materials, keep in mind you currently already have an Apollusa and a Lib:</p><p>- Make Dingirsu</p><p>This offers extra protection while also grabbing a banished machine. But you lose Crescendo, which would be useless without controlling Galatea, you need to instead go for Return or Babel. Which are decent, and it's fun to go for return then draw the fourth summon you needed just before you activated it :/.</p><p>- Make Galatea, set Crescendo</p><p>This still gives you the omni negation from Crescendo, but you still lose some protection for your Apollusa you would have kept if you made Dingirsu or I:P. You also get crucial spell/trap protection against things like DRNM or Forbidden Droplet.</p><p>- Make I:P</p><p>This allows you to still access your powerful link monsters and gives you a shuffle from Lib, but you lose spell/trap protection. All it takes is a Forbidden Droplet or DRNM and your board is dead. Whelp, sucks to suck.</p><p>These are only 3 of the possibilities, but there are more depending on your scenario.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>End</strong></p><p>Thanks for reading through this essay. This deck takes some skill to master, but though practice, you get a powerful deck that can end on tons of interruption. Or you could get hand trapped to death and end on Galatea and I:P, which is still decent. I hope you enjoy playing this deck, and happy dueling! :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I also added a ""Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon"" so that this deck would have a valid target for Instant Fusion, considering the other cards in his extra deck I figured that if Zane were to add a card for Instant Fussion to target it would be a dragon, and there just werent any other good options, <br />There are only 5 dragon type fusion monsters that are level 5 or bellow, and only 3 of them can be summoned with Instant Fusion, the other two option were ""Alligator's Sword Dragon"" and ""Darkfire Dragon"", Curse of Dragon simply has the highest attack from the options available making it the best choice to pair with Cyberdark Dragons effect even if it doesn't exactly fit in with the rest of the extra deck</p>"

Another thing to consider is that Herald of Ultimateness can use&nbsp;<em>any</em> fairy, so did anyone else forget that ALL main deck despia monsters are fairies? Anyways, with the signiture boss monsters from these two archetypes, it should be easy to control your opponent before swooping in for the kill.

If you feel like your hand is somehow dead go into gear gigant x shenanigans and try to get as many machines in the grave as you can for MIXER ROID, one of the best Roids in the deck, its one of the final gambits in the deck. I sometimes make Cycroid manually and it still works out.

Cyber Jar is fantastic in any old school Yugioh deck and still has its niche uses today.<br />And the other two are just filler cards because this deck could use a few more level 4 or bellow monsters to avoid bricking.</p><p>P.S. I added XZ - Tank Cannon and YZ - Tank Dragon to the extra deck despite it not being shown in the show because he has all the fusion materials and already runs XY - Dragon Cannon so having XZ and YZjust feels right even if he's never shown to have one.</p><p>P.S. While Kaiba does use Mirror Force Dragon, but he uses it while tag dueling with Yugi and uses his mirror force, surprisingly enough Kaiba is never actually shown having mirror force in any of his decks so I'm forced to side deck it.</p>"

However, the new support granted to them in 2022's <em>Dimension Force</em> finally provided an opportunity for these mighty plants to return! Of course, speculative competitive duelists then tried to zombify the deck using Branded/Albaz as a puppeteer rather than trying to optimize pure. This resulted in a failed attempt at bringing them into the mainstream format of the day. I was furious about this as Predaplants had been one of the decks that brought me back into the game after a long hiatus, and seeing them be represented only as a wilted husk was insulting. With a YCS coming up, I decided to try to make Predaplants the best they could be while leveling up my deckbuilding skills. This list is the result of a weeklong bootcamp on deckbuilding philosophy and plenty of tests; with this new knowledge I plan on continuing to iterate upon it as time passes! This deck is not intended to be a final and static product - focusing on different aspects of it such as editing it to be more of an OTK variant comes to mind - but as it is I think this is a solid base to build from.</p><p>In terms of its capabilities and style, this deck is a fusion-based combo-oriented midrange deck which uses many different fusion methods to put together a fairly balanced board with light monster control and a few surprise disruptions as well as the occasional omni-negate. It can break boards fairly easily and is fine going either first or second due to its consistency and abundance of options in either case, expanded upon even further by the Side Deck past round 1. With my playstyle I tend to prefer going second, but going first has never seemed to give me any trouble with this list. Predaplant pure can grind a decent amount but this particular build is not made for longer games, though variant builds could likely go on for longer at the cost of having a lower ceiling and less explosive combos. As it is, the deck is also perfectly capable of OTKs with its average to good endboards and can go over the top on its stronger endboards. If tweaked, the deck can combo into an OTK very easily and has enough disruption and floodgate potential to also orient itself more toward control instead if desired.</p><p>This deck also tends to be nonlinear in its combo strings to the point where even if you mess up a combo you can still salvage it into a good enough state if you play your cards right and think creatively. If you check the ""Sample Combos and Gameplay"" section you'll see what I mean. My version of Predaplant pure uses Predator Counters as a supplement to the main combo-focused strategy rather than the focus, but they do play a key role in the control options and endboards this deck has. Speaking of which, average endboards are not usually the most unbreakable out there when playing this deck, but as a midrange deck you can't exactly expect such things. It still functions well enough to take games and the better endboards are plenty strong, but the rather fair power level of the average board is a clear limitation that prevents the deck from being strong enough to break the rogue ceiling and contend with more powerful ones. In any case, I find that this deck is a fun and rewarding one to play while having an aesthetic and style I enjoy very much. Hopefully through this deck overview others can come to appreciate the Predaplants for more than just being a decent Polymerization/Fusion spell search engine or an Arc-V anime feature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1gk2ggbfl111""><strong>Glossary</strong></h3><ul><li>""CbtG"" ..........................................................

Getting this monster out as soon as you can is generally a priority, though with sufficiently lucky hands you may not need to do so until later into the combo if at all. While the next card on this list is the most frequent target for <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> as a Main Deck summon, sometimes you may find yourself instead bringing out a <strong>""Predaplant Sarraceniant""</strong> or a <strong>""Predaplant Chlamydosundew""</strong> for extension.</p><ul><li><a href=""/card/?search=61677004"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/61677004.jpg"" data-card=""61677004"" data-name=""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra (61677004)</span></a></li></ul><p>This monster is typically the first monster you want to Special Summon from <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> during a duel. <strong>""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra""</strong> is a soft Garnet, as while you don't want to draw into this card due to the limitations Predaplants have on summoning Main Deck monsters, you may still use this monster for discards as well as in hand or on the field for Fusion Summons. I have included two copies of this card despite the effect being once per duel for the edge cases where you draw into a copy before being able to summon <strong>""Predap.

This card is both useful to be drawn into in your opening hand and to be searched by other means, but in either case I would advise against immediately summoning <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> if you have other options. The single copy of <strong>""Linkuriboh""</strong> in the Extra Deck can be used to turn an on-field <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> (not summoned by their own effect) into a free Predaplant monster search and try to undo a brick. If you discard this card for the cost of <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> and summon <strong>""Predap. Darling.""</strong> you can use the generally less useful <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> search to Chain block the once-per-duel search of <strong>""Predap.

I just like snakes.). Easily the most important single card to get out turn 1/2 from the Extra Deck, <strong>""Predap. Ambulo.""</strong> provides not only a generic Predaplant search from the Main Deck, GY, or face-up Extra Deck, but also allows you to Tribute a monster to extend your combo with a freshly summoned Predaplant monster from your Deck (giving further searches if you Tribute <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> or <strong>""Predap. Sarr.""</strong>), including <strong>""Predap. Darling.""</strong>! On top of all that, <strong>""Predap. Ambulo.""</strong> is a Fusion monster which is uniquely helpful for summoning the strongest Predaplant monsters from the Extra Deck. This monster is <em>the</em> <strong>""Instant Fusion""</strong> target if ever there was one. With a lovely design and many functions, this is easily one of my favorite new additions to the archetype from <em>Dimension Force</em>. I still have to get myself the rarity-upgraded reprint...</p><ul><li><a href=""/card/?search=79864860"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79864860.jpg"" data-card=""79864860"" data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum (79864860)</span></a></li></ul><p>Being the main boss monster of this deck, <strong>""Predaplant Triphyoverutum""</strong> is no pushover and has both recurrence and raw strength, not to mention a hunger for Predator Counters and a potent anti-Extra Deck summon negation. If combined with cards such as <strong>""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"",</strong><strong> ""Predaplant Dragostapelia""</strong>, or <strong>""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon""</strong> after using the effect of <strong>""Predaplant Triantis""</strong> you are able to get exact lethal damage, if not even more than lethal, in even just a lower-tier endboard. You can often make use of cards such as <strong>""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju""</strong> and <strong>""Super Polymerization""</strong> or <strong>""Predap. Trian.""</strong> and <strong>""Predap. Chlamydo.""</strong> to use your opponent's own monsters to summon this card, too, which helps clear the board further for an OTK or heavy damage! The artwork on this card is one of my favorites here as well so I always love getting at least one of these onto my board if I can. While the more powerful <strong>""Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon""</strong> is available in this deck as well, I find that that card is both a bit more situationally summonable than this one and comes up less often due to requiring a far more powerful board in the first place, thus being more of an 'overboss' than a 'main boss' if you will.</p><ul><li><a href=""/card/?search=70427670"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/70427670.jpg"" data-card=""70427670"" data-name=""Predaplant Bufolicula"">Predaplant Bufolicula (70427670)</span></a></li></ul><p><strong>""Predaplant Bufolicula""</strong> takes up the rear in this section but is still plenty important to the deck's overall strategy. Searchable in many ways and usable without needing to summon, <strong>""Predap. Bufo.""</strong> can Fusion Summon (only) DARK monsters just like good ol' <strong>""Polymerization""</strong> in a deck that already generally summons DARK monsters anyway. If brought into the Extra Deck as a Fusion Material, <strong>""Predap. Bufo.""</strong> can also recur the second Pendulum monster the deck uses, <strong>""Predap. Trian.""</strong>, which is typically sent into the Extra Deck with <strong>""Predap. Bufo.""</strong> to allow for a surprise Chain block typically used after an equally surprising combo.&nbsp;<strong>""Predap. Trian.""</strong><strong> </strong>allows you to place Predator Counters onto monsters on either field equal to the number of monsters you control if&nbsp;<strong>""Predap. Trian.""</strong><strong> </strong>is used as Fusion Material; those Predator Counters can then be used for further fusions or other effects your Predaplant Extra Deck monsters have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1gk2ggbfl113""><strong>Miscellaneous Cards</strong></h3><p>Other notable cards in this deck include <a href=""/card/?search=48048590"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/48048590.jpg"" data-card=""48048590"" data-name=""Keeper of Dragon Magic"">Keeper of Dragon Magic (48048590)</span></a>, <a href=""/card/?search=28674152"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/28674152.jpg"" data-card=""28674152"" data-name=""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju"">Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju (28674152)</span></a>, <a href=""/card/?search=31643613"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/31643613.jpg"" data-card=""31643613"" data-name=""Predapractice"">Predapractice (31643613)</span></a>, <a href=""/card/?search=89181134"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/89181134.jpg"" data-card=""89181134"" data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew (89181134)</span></a>, <a href=""/card/?search=25586143"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/25586143.jpg"" data-card=""25586143"" data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia (25586143)</span></a>, <a href=""/card/?search=69946549"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/69946549.jpg"" data-card=""69946549"" data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia (69946549)</span></a>, and <a href=""/card/?search=11765832"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/11765832.jpg"" data-card=""11765832"" data-name=""Garura, Wings of Resonant Life"">Garura, Wings of Resonant Life (11765832)</span></a>, and <a href=""/card/?search=53819028"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/53819028.jpg"" data-card=""53819028"" data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant (53819028)</span></a>, though this deck is designed so just about any card is used to help create a consistent and powerful strategy.</p><p>To briefly go over these other cards, <strong>""Keeper of Dragon Magic""</strong> is used as an alternative to <strong>""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra""</strong> in hands where you open with either both cards or just the former, allowing you to search for <strong>""Instant Fusion""</strong> to summon <strong>""Predaplant Ambulomelides""</strong> and proceed into a combo.</p><p><strong>""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju""</strong> is a Kaiju that's here to do for you what Kaiju always do, but there's more! <strong>""Radian"" </strong>has a built-in couple synergies with this deck in particular. The ATK stat on this card is just 2800 compared to <strong>""Predaplant Triphyoverutum""</strong> having 3000, not to mention <strong>""Predaplant Chimerafflesia""</strong> being able to either banish or punch over <strong>""Radian""</strong> with ease. Further, <strong>""Super Polymerization""</strong> and <strong>""Predaprime Fusion""</strong> are both very much able to take advantage of the DARK attribute <strong>""Radian""</strong> has in order to summon a variety of Extra Deck monsters. ""Radian"" also happens to be Level 7, meaning a <strong>""Predap. Chimera."" </strong>can natively banish <strong>""Radian""</strong> from your opponent's field after use in case you do not have Predator Counters ready to place. Another more obscure synergy is that since this deck's Pendulum Scales happen to be 0 and 8, on rare occasions you can Pendulum Summon <strong>""Radian""</strong> for a surprisingly powerful force!</p><p><strong>""Predapractice""</strong> is one of the deck's main Main Deck extenders in that the spell allows you to push out a card like <strong>""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio""</strong> or <strong>""Predaplant Sarraceniant""</strong> while simultaneously adding a new Predaplant monster to your hand. <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> can take advantage of this by immediately sending the searched monster to the GY in case you didn't already have options or in case said options are suboptimal, such as another <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> or a <strong>""Predaplant Bufolicula""</strong>.</p><p><strong>""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"" </strong>is a unique case as one of the deck's miscellaneous fusion options, but this card's abilities should not be taken likely. A decently reliable card, this can help you break yourself out of bricks or even clear parts of your opponent's board depending on how well you play. Being able to fuse monsters on either side of the field with Predator Counters is helpful when you are lacking or otherwise wanting to save a copy of <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> or want to simply extend your plays further during a turn. While you will usually make use of cards such as <strong>""Ultra Polymerization""</strong> and <strong>""Predap. Bufo.""</strong> to perfrorm the main fusions on your turn, this card can push you over the top in situations where you may need one last fusion to turn things around. <strong>""Predap. Chlamydo."" </strong>is not usually my first choice for fusion during a turn, but certainly one I always take into consideration as a Special Summon from deck or hand, or even as a Normal Summon if the board calls for such a play.</p><p><strong>""Predap. Chimera.""</strong> is a decent mid-boss monster who can punch over a surprisingly high amount of monsters while also boasting a stealthy yet useful banishment effect that can hit most anything with a level if you're smart about keeping track of your Predator Counters. Moreover, <strong>""Predap. Chimera.""</strong> can be used to fuse into stronger monsters while also giving you a free Polymerization/Fusion spell card search during the next Standby Phase or can do so after being sent to the GY by conventional means, which can sometimes save you from a loss and turn a game around.</p><p><strong>""Predaplant Dragostapelia""</strong> is notable as a stronger mid-boss monster and control option whose effect negates the activated effects of opposing monsters who have Predator Counters. The Quick Effect ability to place a Predator Counter onto one of your opponent's monsters is helpful to carefully time pinpoint negations, but do take note that you can also take advantage of the effect of <strong>""Predaplant Triantis""</strong> to spread Predator Counters around the board without needing to use <strong>""Predap. Drago.""</strong> at all, causing a blanket negation which you can still exploit with the remaining Quick Effect if your opponent has a way to place or replace a monster on their board with a new one. From there, you can use <strong>""Predap. Chimera.""</strong> if available to banish away any problem monsters on your opponent's field, or use <strong>""Predap. Chlamydo."" </strong>to fuse them away. Also of note is that this monster's Predator Counters also make afflicted monsters Level 1, meaning you can occasionally catch an opponent by surprise and interrupt their setup by locking them out of a variety of Extra Deck (or Ritual) Summons! While not the strongest monster of the bunch at 2700 ATK, <strong>""Predap. Drago.""</strong> can still prove to be a thorn in your opponent's side and summoning more than one of them onto the same board can cause even more trouble as the Quick Effect is only a soft once-per-turn.</p><p><strong>""Garura, Wings of Resonant Life""</strong> is the deck's main <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> target when going up against non-DARK decks. While <strong>""Mudragon of the Swamp""</strong> is useful as well, I find that the card is a bit more niche in usage compared to the more prolific <strong>""Garura""</strong>, whose summoning requirement is just 2 monsters with the same Type and Attribute, but different names. Either way, these cards allow you to use some amazingly powerful removal that often has no way to be avoided while simultaneously granting you the advantage of a potential draw or decent DEF (for <strong>""Garura""</strong>) or decent protection that can also act as disruption (for <strong>""Mudragon""</strong>). Note that you can use <strong>""Garura""</strong> as a DARK Fusion monster to go into stronger Extra Deck monsters while giving yourself that easy draw, not unlike <strong>""Predap. Ambulo."" </strong>and <strong>""Mudragon""</strong> can self-modulate to DARK as needed to do the same, albeit without a subsequent card draw.</p><p><strong>""Predap. Sarrac.""</strong> is a helpful and quietly powerful card with a fully featured Predaplant card search not only including the monsters, but the spells and traps (latter not included in this build) too! You can creatively get this card onto the board to use the search effect for extension the deck might otherwise feel it lacks. This card also has an edge case-usable battle effect, occasionally providing a surprise opportunity to surivive an otherwise lethal blow, then make a comeback with the subsequent search. While in theory <strong>""Predap. Sarrac."" </strong>feels like a slightly more situational <strong>""Predaplant Byblisp""</strong> during combos due to being rather unfit as a discard option, in reality their uses are slightly different and add texture to the deck's already robust nonlinear combo options. Don't underestimate this card!</p><p>The fusion-related spells, those being <a href=""/card/?search=1845204"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/1845204.jpg"" data-card=""1845204"" data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion (1845204)</span></a>, <a href=""/card/?search=76647978"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/76647978.jpg"" data-card=""76647978"" data-name=""Ultra Polymerization"">Ultra Polymerization (76647978)</span></a>, <a href=""/card/?search=8148322"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/8148322.jpg"" data-card=""8148322"" data-name=""Predaprime Fusion"">Predaprime Fusion (8148322)</span></a>, and <a href=""/card/?search=48130397"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/48130397.jpg"" data-card=""48130397"" data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization (48130397)</span></a>, are all useful in their own ways which will become self-evident in the ""Sample Combos and Gameplay"" section below.

Use whatever elements of these sample combos you find useful. You'll likely find many more not listed here as this is not meant to be exhaustive. The longer and less linear combos are written with letters such as (A), (B), and (C), each of which is intended to be a different line depending on what you have in your hand or on the field. They are not meant to be run through sequentially, but some do have substeps written with (i)-(iii) within their parent combo line. Substeps are treated the same as their parent lines, as in they're separate options depending on your choices and are not to be done sequentially. If a line or substep is indicated as the next step after an arrow, such as &rarr; (A), that just means to proceed to the line or substep it is directing you to. Do your best to memorize these combos through practice and find your own unique spins on them as you get to know the deck better. If you put the effort in, you'll be reaping what you sow in no time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The Unbrick (<a href=""/card/?search=48048590"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/48048590.jpg"" data-card=""48048590"" data-name=""Keeper of Dragon Magic"">Keeper of Dragon Magic (48048590)</span></a> + anything OR <a href=""/card/?search=31643613"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/31643613.jpg"" data-card=""31643613"" data-name=""Predapractice"">Predapractice (31643613)</span></a> + any Predaplant monster)</strong></li></ul><p>This combo is simple because it's not particularly common. If you have a hand that sucks (as in, just 1 monster) but you have a copy of <strong>""Keeper of Dragon Magic""</strong> and anything OR <strong>""Predapractice""</strong> and any Predaplant monster, just... well, use them. If you have a hand with zero monsters and none of your cards in hand are <strong>""Instant Fusion""</strong>, just set what Quick-Play and Trap cards you have and hope for the best as any deck would. Still, in this combo chances are you drew into <strong>""Called by the Grave""</strong> and at least one <strong>""DRNM""</strong> since they're some of the few cards that don't directly push the strategy forward; the former of those two cards can at least be used to ensure your unbrick sticks even if the opponent attempts to use <strong>""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring""</strong> to stop you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>""KoDM""</strong> has some obvious best targets and many suboptimal ones. <strong>""Predaplant Byblisp""</strong> is a great one, though at that point I wouldn't even call the hand a brick, and any spare copies of Spells or Traps are welcome options. <strong>""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra""</strong> or <strong>""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju"" </strong>are fine choices as well since they do little to nothing on their own. <strong>""Predaprac.""</strong>, <strong>""Inst. Fusion""</strong>, or <strong>""CbtG""</strong> would be terrible options and I'd also not at all consider this hand a brick if you have them. <strong>""Predaplant Bufolicula"" </strong>or <strong>""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio""</strong> or <strong>""Predaplant Sarraceniant""</strong> would likewise be bad ideas. Most other Predaplant monsters are fine to use, and out of all the fusion spells you can throw away, <strong>""Predaprime Fusion""</strong> is probably the best candidate if necessary. When you use <strong>""KoDM""</strong> in this sort of case, your most frequent search target is <strong>""Inst. Fusion""</strong>, or if not that then <strong>""Ultra Polymerization""</strong>. <strong>""Inst. Fusion""</strong> can then be used to go into <strong>""Predaplant Ambulomelides""</strong> as usual and from there you're basically unbricked since you now have a search as well as the option to turn <strong>""KoDM""</strong> into any Predaplant monster in the Main Deck.</p><p><strong>""Predapractice""</strong> summoning any Predaplant monster from your hand pretty much immediately undoes your brick. Even if the Predaplant you're summoning from hand is <strong>""Predap. Bufo.""</strong> or <strong>""Predaplant Triantis""</strong> or <strong>""Predap. Darling.""</strong>, you can still add a <strong>""Predaplant Chlamydosundew""</strong>, <strong>""Predaplant Byblisp""</strong>, or <strong>""Predap. Bufo.""</strong> to hand (or others depending on what else you have in hand or on board) to Normal Summon or activate as a Pendulum Scale to combo into <strong>""Predap.

Fusion""</strong> to surprise your opponent with a copy of <strong>""SVFD""</strong>, <strong>""Predap. Chimera.""</strong>, or sometimes even <strong>""Predap. Triphyo.""</strong> or <strong>""Predap. Drago.""</strong>, after which you can set Predator Counters carefully on the field to give your opponent some trouble when your can take advantage of them either on a future turn with <strong>""Predap. Chimera.""</strong>, <strong>""Predap. Triphyo.""</strong>, and <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> or immediately with <strong>""Predap. Triphyo.""</strong> or <strong>""Predap. Drago."" </strong>On top of all this, <strong>""Predap. Trian.""</strong> is usually returned to your hand thanks to <strong>""Predap. Bufo."" </strong>What a synergistic pair! If you want to be extra bold and happen to have a lot of resources still available, you may even try summoning <strong>""Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon""</strong> for a much more potent lock on the board than the simple monster and Extra Deck negation <strong>""Predap. Drago.""</strong> and <strong>""Predap. Triphyo.""</strong> respectively provide. Just be aware of your resources and don't overextend unless you're particularly confident!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Some additional tips for combos</strong></li></ul><p>Going first: Following either combo string, if you have a copy of <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> or <strong>""Gozen""</strong> in hand, be sure to set them before you end your turn, though in the case of the former you should keep at least one card in hand to discard for cost later (especially if that card is <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong>!), though if you fused away <strong>""Predap. Chimera.""&nbsp;</strong>at some point in the turn you can afford to use your whole hand since you'll search a Polymerization/Fusion card via <strong>""Predap. Chimera.""&nbsp;</strong>in the next Standby Phase to then use. It carries the slight risk of the search being negated or punished somehow, but it is an option. From there, be prepared to hit your opponent where it hurts and use <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> with precision and prevent them from building a good board!</p><p>Going second: Following or during either combo string, if you have a copy of <strong>""Super Poly."" </strong>in hand, feel free to use it on your opponent's monsters to summon <strong>""Garura, Wings of Resonant Life"" </strong>or <strong>""Mudragon of the Swamp""</strong> or <strong>""SVFD""</strong> or <strong>""Predap. Triphyo.""</strong> or even <strong>""Predap. Drago."" </strong>-- whatever you can afford, really. Don't be shy to use your own monsters as materials or summon <strong>""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju"" </strong>to facilitate easier Fusion Summons. Furthermore, if you instead have a copy of <strong>""Predap. Fusion"" </strong>you can still potentially use it if your opponent has an appropriate material you can use as a material for <strong>""Predap. Triphyo.""</strong>. If you can place Predator Counters and have both <strong>""Predap. Triphyo."" </strong>and a Fusion monster with at least 2500 ATK on board, you can place a Predator Counter on the other Fusion monster to give <strong>""Predap. Triphyo."" </strong>enough for an OTK provided you managed to clear your opponent's board. Even if you didn't do so, you can still accumulate lots of damage this way and break their board further through battle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>A note of confidence</strong></li></ul><p>As I've said previously, there are plenty of options and mixups and combos I haven't listed here at all. Consider, for example, Special Summoning <strong>""Predap. Sarrac.""</strong> from <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> on a board which already has <strong>""Predap. Ambulo.""</strong>, then use <strong>""Predap. Ambulo.""</strong> to Tribute <strong>""Predap. Sarrac.""</strong> to Special Summon <strong>""Predap. Darling."" </strong>and pick up a Polymerization/Fusion card of your choice, which creates its own Chain block using <strong>""Predap. Sarrac.""</strong> instead of the usual <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> This also works quite cleanly if you happened to have <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> in hand already and used that card as your discard for <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> to Special Summon <strong>""Predap. Sarrac.""</strong> as described above. Your options are limited only by your creativity, experimentation, and understanding of this deck's many card combinations. The ones I have listed are just some of the most fundamental combo concepts to understand for this deck before you work on more complicated, lengthy, tricky, or surprising ones on your own. I wish you luck, reader! Love your Plant (and Dragon and Winged Beast and Wyrm and Fiend and Cyberse) friends, and they'll love you back tenfold!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1gk2ggbfl115""><strong>About the Side Deck<br /></strong></h3><p>I've intentionally left the Side Deck incomplete in this upload so you, the reader, can come up with ideas that suit your personal dueling environment. <strong>""Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju""</strong> is useful as a replacement for <strong>""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju""</strong> and a <strong>""Gozen Match""</strong> or something when going up against Floowandereeze, <strong>""Infinite Impermanence""</strong> is an easy replacement for <strong>""Gozen""</strong> in terms of trading Trap for Trap when you're facing someone who already only uses one Attribute, plus <strong>""Inf. Imp.""</strong> is just really good in general. <strong>""Dark Hole"" </strong>is a nice helpful board-breaking option when you know you're going second, especially if you happen to go up against someone running a card like <strong>""Toadally Awesome""</strong>, deterring them from using the card themself if they choose to negate it with that card. If they don't negate it, it still has incidental synergy with this deck via the deck's numerous postmortem searches as well as the fact that your Pendulum Scales can still be used to go into a fusion on the subsequently empty board.</p><p>The rest of this Side Deck, however, I leave for you to build for yourself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1gk7rpvsiu""><strong>Discussion and Techs/Alterations</strong></h3><p>To list out a bunch of experiments I tried while building this deck, I've already attempted to run some cute or expected tech cards like <strong>""Millennium-Eyes Restrict""</strong> or <strong>""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon""</strong>, for example. Unfortunately, in testing <strong>""M.-E. Restrict""</strong> was inconsistent to bring out due to the deck's reliance on <strong>""Instant Fusion""</strong> while the latter monster was rarely summoned and did little to help boards that the other Fusion Monsters could do better. In earlier builds I also ran <strong>""Relinquished Anima""</strong> instead of <strong>""Linkuriboh""</strong> because I prefer the former's design as a fan of <strong>""Relinquished""</strong>, but in practice it seemed that <strong>""Linkur.""</strong> just tended to be more effective as a resource due to opponents playing around the Anima column in general, not to mention the fact that <strong>""Linkur.""</strong> could recur themself for further use off of monsters with Predator Counters if needed. However, I could see <strong>""Relin. Anima""</strong> to be more worth it if you personally tend to play in a place where people do not frequently play with the Anima column in mind, or if you find that you tend to draw into Kaiju monsters frequently as you can place them in the column for a quick switcheroo. I also just really really like the card. It's just helpful having some kind of option to turn your <strong>""Predaplant Byblisp""</strong> or a monster with a Predator Counter into a tangible resource beyond just being potential Fusion Materials. It may be worth investigating Extra Deck ratios in general to see if it's feasible to fit more Link Monsters into it for further use.</p><p><strong>""Cross-Sheep""</strong> is a card I recently considered trying as a tech to see if I could push the deck's nonlinear combo limits even further, though the decklist is tight enough that it's a bit hard to decide what to drop in favor of that card and the use of<strong> ""Gozen Match""</strong> may make the card harder to work with unless I invest in an additional DARK Link Monster of some kind to combo into. If I figure that all out and the changes are good, I'll be sure to update this list and description to account for the new card(s). I'm pretty happy with the lack of generic Extra Deck bosses, so cards like <strong>""Knightmare Unicorn""</strong> would not be preferred for the sake of keeping the currently unique image this deck has.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I've also considered adding in <strong>""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson""</strong> as a DARK monster for fusion with an easy summoning condition whose level is in between the deck's Pendulum Scales. Furthermore, the card would be an easy discard option not only for <strong>""Super Polymerization"" </strong>but also for <strong>""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio""</strong> on top of being usable for Fusion Summons from the hand while still retaining value in the GY. This card is somewhat unexplored for this deck but could likely fit in quite well in place of something like the one-of <strong>""Predapruning""</strong>, though my problem is that the deck already tends to spend 1000 to 3000 LP on a turn as-is, meaning one would want to use <strong>""Destr. the Lost Drago. Fris.""</strong> either immediately in their turn before even activating<strong> ""Inst. Fusion"" </strong>or after having already used <strong>""Inst. Fusion"" </strong>as well as <strong>""Ultra Polymerization""</strong> as otherwise one's LP count would be dangerously low at 500. Doing one of these other sequences would at least bring LP down to 1000 or 2500, but such a limitation makes it tough to recommend <strong>""Destr. the Lost Drago. Fris.""</strong> outside of OTK builds of this deck.</p><p>At one point early on I tried having <strong>""Lonefire Blossom""</strong> in the deck as generic Plant support for a level of consistency I assumed the deck did not have. I found that in testing the card did far more harm than good due not only to the card needing to use up my Normal Summon to limit my combo options, but also because as a FIRE monster <strong>""Lone. Blossom""</strong> did not even have synergy with the Extra Deck as a Fusion Material. While I do understand why many people would make Predaplant lists that included that card (as I had seen a number of people who did while iterating upon my '1.0' list), it seems to be a misguided answer to a problem the deck does not even have in the first place. The card also provides a choke point for the deck where you may be left with a completely empty board if you use your Normal Summon, which I find particularly dangerous. Speaking of people's preferences, I can in earnest see a case for increasing <strong>""Predaplant Bufolicula"" </strong>to 3 copies and lowering <strong>""Predaplant Chlamydosundew""</strong> to 2 instead of my current reversed ratio. <strong>""Predap. Chlamydo.""</strong> can be used as a Fusion Material alongside other Fusion Materials unlike <strong>""Predap. Bufolicula""</strong>, which I think makes it easier to fix bricky hands. I prefer the ratios this way as in testing they just felt snappier to me, but if you feel otherwise then I don't blame you.</p><p>I also once flip-flopped between running 2 <strong>""Predaplant Dragostapelia""</strong> and 1 <strong>""Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon""</strong> and just running 3 <strong>""Predap. Drago.""</strong>. I find that the more powerful of the two feels almost winmore sometimes and requires far more of an overextension to get on board while also reducing your mixup options in favor of a much more traditional omni-negate. While the deck does at least have ways to recur or semi-frequently place Predator Counters on either board, doing so after fusing away two Fusion Monsters is not nearly as easy since you will have had to use so many more resources to reach that point. You can also easily OTK with this deck without needing the overwhelming power of the overboss monster. Still, I rarely get out 3 <strong>""Predap. Drago.""</strong> in one duel so I see no problem with the current ratio. 1 or 2 usually get the job done, especially since <strong>""Predaplant Ambulomelides""</strong> can bring even the Predaplant Fusion Monsters back from the GY and <strong>""Predapruning""</strong> can Special Summon them back if needed. is also usually a monster summoned when made to go first, so there is little reason to even summon more than a couple in the first place. <strong>""Predaprun.""</strong> is a card that I have not experimented with enough in general in comparison to most of the rest of the deck, so sometimes I wonder if upping it to 2 would be beneficial, and if so, what I would want to reduce in return. Increasing the number of fusion spells the deck has is also something I have considered but I believe the current ratio tends to work well, though running only a core suite of five plus another five monster-based fusion cards likely reduces the deck's grind game.</p><p>I am aware that it is possible for this deck to run <strong>""Rivalry of Warlords""</strong> instead of <strong>""Gozen""</strong> as the former tends to be a wee bit more powerful as a floodgate and does not hinder the deck's Main Deck play much at all. However, one must note that there are limitations: <strong>""Garura, Wings of Resonant Life""</strong>, <strong>""Mudragon of the Swamp""</strong>, and the two Fusion Dragons become impossible to summon when choosing <strong>""Rivalry""</strong> over <strong>""Gozen"" </strong>(with even&nbsp;<strong>""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju""</strong><strong> </strong>sometimes becoming unusable as well). With that glaring issue in play, <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> would be made far weaker of a removal card in such a build, not to mention the ceiling of the deck being lowered with its overboss being impossible to bring out. Perhaps a version of this deck built upon more conventional removal that avoids the use of any Kaiju or <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> could afford that as I would imagine it would use far more Plant-based Extra Deck monsters and more grindy Main Deck fusion or GY recursion cards. It's my opinion that at that point the flavor of the deck would, in part, be lost. Don't let that stop you if you want to take it in that direction, though. I'm sure there are good options if you do!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also consider the possibility of mixing up this base decklist to make a more going-first or going-second oriented version of the deck for potentially higher ceilings. As it is, the untouched Main Deck and Extra Deck are meant to work for either scenario in a midrange style and thus have a mix of cards for either option, but if you wish to have an explosive going-second version or a control-oriented going-first one you do have options.</p><p>When making a going-second build <strong>""Lightning Storm""</strong> replacing <strong>""Gozen""</strong> is the obvious one, as is putting in some hand traps to keep your opponent's board and GY broken. Feel free to play further with your options by adding in the aforementioned <strong>""Relin. Anima""</strong> in place of <strong>""Linkur.""</strong> and perhaps a <strong>""M.-E. Restrict""</strong> or <strong>""Guardian Chimera""</strong> in place of a <strong>""Predap. Drago.""</strong> Also consider adding a second copy of <strong>""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon""</strong> to replace the third <strong>""Predap. Ambulo.""</strong> as that card is unlikely to be summoned more than twice when you can OTK easily with this deck. Removing one copy of <strong>""Predaplant Triantis""</strong> probably wouldn't hurt either, freeing up at least one space for a nice one-of like <strong>""Dinowrestler Pankratops""</strong>. Also take note of the possibility of replacing <strong>""Predapru.""</strong> with <strong>""Destr. the Lost Drago. Fris.""&nbsp;</strong>as described above. Finally, adding in another board breaker in place of <strong>""Dark Ruler No More""</strong> would probably be helpful since the card prevents you from OTKing at all.</p><p>The going-first variety of this deck could likely slot in a small <strong>""PSY-Frame Gamma""</strong> and <strong>""PSY-Frame Driver""</strong> package in place of <strong>""DRNM""</strong>, with <strong>""PSY-Frame Omega""</strong> taking the spot of one of the <strong>""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"" </strong>cards in the Extra Deck. Otherwise three copies of <strong>""Inf. Imp.""</strong> can be flexible in the face of being made to go second or for further disruption on your going-first board. Obviously you can also feel free to put in more floodgates and negations if desired, such as ""Rivalry"" or <strong>""Summon Limit""</strong> as you won't be summoning very much after your initial combo string and can get around the limitation by summoning during your opponent's turn using <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> or <strong>""Predaprime Fusion""</strong>. <strong>""Sales Ban"" </strong>and <strong>""Triple Tactics Talent""</strong> could also be some nice and spicy additions if you feel they would work particularly well in your personal dueling environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to more generic cards and staples, I don't think this deck generates enough expendable resources to reliably be able to use something like<strong> ""Forbidden Droplet""</strong>, hence my inclusion of the more proletarian <strong>""DRNM""</strong>. Still, I could see a case for the former as you at least have <strong>""Predap. Byb."" </strong>as a prime target from the hand. If you're not a fan of <strong>""DRNM""</strong> being in the Main Deck, though, there's likely some nice generic options to replace it with like <strong>""Twin Twisters"" </strong>or <strong>""Triple Tac. Tal.""</strong>, or even your hand trap of choice. The first of those two cards is particularly helpful for covering the deck's general lack of backrow removal, while I think the second of them is pretty nice as a surprise mixup card to add to the deck's spicy already baked-in mixup options. <strong>""Cosmic Cyclone"" </strong>may also be an option for virtue of <strong>""Predap. Byb.""</strong> remaining the deck's sole direct advantage-generating discard and thus a precious resource, but I hesitate to recommend the card as<strong> ""Ultra Poly.""</strong> and <strong>""Inst. Fusion""</strong> already take so many LP to use. On the topic of advantage, I don't believe there is a Pot card that this deck can run without major drawbacks and so I do not use any of those in this list. At most <strong>""Pot of Desires""</strong> may be usable in OTK builds but this deck searches so much that it may either be a liability or a waste in comparison to more immediately useful going-second cards. Still, the card may be helpful as negation bait if nothing else.</p><p>As for hand traps, I've thought about maybe including a DARK one like <strong>""D.D. Crow""</strong> for the ability to potentially use them as Fusion Materials too or, in the case of <strong>""Crow""</strong>, an incidental synergy with <strong>""Linkur.""</strong>, but I haven't committed to doing so yet. In regards to other hand traps I personally dislike the monster designs of common ones such as <strong>""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"" </strong>or <strong>""Chaos Hunter"" </strong>or <strong>""Skull Meister"" </strong>(note the latter two are DARK), so I refrain from using them myself. <strong>""Dark Honest""</strong> is another tantalizing possibility to help with OTKs for those who like the design. Still, assuming you don't have the... aesthetic limitations I do (note the lack of any humans; even <strong>""Keeper of Dragon Magic""</strong> is, in my mind, a fur or an avatar of me as a duelist), then you'll likely have a lot more options you can throw into this deck. <strong>""Aromaseraphy Jasmine""</strong> and <strong>""Sylvan Dancepione""</strong> come to mind as examples of such cards (but I digress - they aren't hand traps).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With all that said, if you want to deviate from the pure build and add more things in too, I think that would be awesome. As much as I do like the idea of being one of only a few Predaplant duelists around, I think I'm happier spreading their potential around for others to work with and make their own just as I've made this personal dueling deck myself. Of course I'm not really sure what would synergize with this deck without also taking over it like Branded, but that means I'm sure there's lots of room for testing on that front for those who wish to. Personally I'm satisfied with Predaplants alone, so I'll be sticking with this until something comes along that I somehow feel the need to mix with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1gk2ggbfl116""><strong>In Master Duel</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, this deck is pretty scuffed in Master Duel even though they finally added the 2022 support. <strong>""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio""</strong> is Semi-Limited, <strong>""Super Polymerization""</strong> is Semi-Limited as well (as is <strong>""Gozen Match""</strong>), and <strong>""Predaplant Verte Anaconda""</strong> is temptingly still allowed at Limited. <strong>""Garura, Wings of Resonant Life""</strong> is a recent TCG-exclusive card and thus has almost no chance of making it into Master Duel any time soon.</p><p>My Master Duel version of the deck is meant for OTKs and is thus heavily weighted toward going second. This version of the deck has <strong>""Relinquished Anima""</strong> instead of <strong>""Linkuriboh""</strong> in the Extra Deck just in case, as well as a second copy of <strong>""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon""</strong> to replace one missing <strong>""Garura""</strong>. I may switch <strong>""SVFD""</strong> to another <strong>""Mudragon of the Swamp""</strong> instead, but I'm unsure right now. I opted to let the second <strong>""CbtG""</strong> replace the missing third copy of <strong>""Super Poly."" </strong>To help with breaking boards I have two copies of <strong>""Lightning Storm""</strong>; I went with that instead of three as <strong>""Harpie's Feather Duster""</strong> takes care of the third backrow wipe and I still want to be using <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> removal where/when I can. I reduced the number of <strong>""Predaplant Ambulomelides""</strong> to 2 in favor of a copy of <strong>""Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom""</strong> for the sometimes useful piercing effect. I also reduced <strong>""Predaplant Dragostapelia""</strong> to 1 and added in a <strong>""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon""</strong>, then put in <strong>""Predaplant Ver. Anac.""</strong> in place of the second missing <strong>""Garura""</strong> case I need the card in a pinch to go over the top. <strong>""Predapruning""</strong> and one copy of<strong> ""Predaplant Triantis""</strong> are gone and in their stead I put in the Semi-Limited <strong>""Dinowrestler Pankratops""</strong> as another useful removal card, a beatstick, or Link Material for <strong>""Predap. Ver. Anac.""</strong> to offset the relative downside of being an non-DARK monster in this deck. I also increased <strong>""Predaplant Bufolicula""</strong> to 3 to try making up for the missing <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> and I added in three copies of <strong>""Infinite Impermanence""</strong> in place of <strong>""Dark Ruler No More""</strong> to provide decent negation without also preventing me from accomplishing an OTK in the first place.</p><p>I also obviously removed<strong> ""Gozen Match""</strong> as it is not particularly helpful going second and is Semi-Limited in Master Duel, and I added two copies of <strong>""Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson""</strong> in its place. At one point I had <strong>""D.D. Crow""</strong> as a generic Level 1 DARK hand trap I enjoy the design of and could use for disruption despite the card being less useful than <strong>""Skull Meister""</strong> or <strong>""Chaos Hunter""</strong> in the format (not to mention the obvious <strong>""Maxx ""C""""</strong> which I do not wish to use). In the future I may replace the card with something like <strong>""Triple Tactics Talent""</strong> but I don't have any copies of it yet, or maybe <strong>""Pot of Desires""</strong> for consistency and negation bait. I also plan to try introducing <strong>""Millennium-Eyes Restrict""</strong> when I have the opportunity to craft one. Only having <strong>""Ultra Polymerization""</strong> and two <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> feels a little risky compared to the <strong>""Predaprime Fusion""</strong> and the extra <strong>""Super Poly.""</strong> in this deck, but I find that in an OTK variant you can usually afford to run fewer fusion spells anyway. In Master Duel it's also still possible to run <strong>""Predap. Ver. Anac.""</strong> for an extra fusion if needed, too.</p><p>Otherwise, the main Predaplant engine in the deck is nearly identical to this non-Master Duel edition. It seems to work pretty well for the most part, but it definitely feels kneecapped in comparison to the original. I may upload my Master Duel version of this deck here someday if I feel like it, though if I do I'll likely just link it to this one since the combos are mostly the same. I'm hoping <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> will be brought to 3 one day. I also hope for many other things I dislike about Master Duel and its banlists, but I digress.</p><hr /><h3 id=""mcetoc_1gk2ggbfl117""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Meow, meow, and another meow. I've reached the description size limit so I think it's a good time to wrap things up. Predaplants mean a lot to me and I'm happy I made what feels like an optimized and consistent deck I can be proud of. If I can update it some more in the future I know I will. Maybe I can upload my Master Duel list as well. I'm hoping the banlist will one day set <strong>""Predap. Ophrys.""</strong> free. Maybe in the TCG<strong> ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"" </strong> will receive an erratum to become less generic and thus able to be removed from the banlist, too, even if that won't do much of note for my build.</p><p>That's about it from me, though.

This deck utilizes mostly non-linear combos to produce a consistent end-board. A lot of builds of PK will tend to differ from one another because of the amount of summoning power the deck has; there's a lot of room for customization, and a lot of different types of strategies you can perform with this deck. In this profile, I will outline the approach I use and try to present popular alternatives.</p><p>With the summoning power of this deck, it is capable of utilizing a plethora of high Link-Rating monsters that can be used to facilitate OTKs or even to close out rougher games. I will not be going over those in combos, as they will mostly be used situationally at your discretion.</p><h3><strong>Combos</strong></h3><hr /><ul><li><p><strong>Tour Guide From The Underworld</strong></p></li></ul><p><em>Normal Summon ""Tour Guide From The Underworld"" &gt; Trigger Effect &gt; Summon ""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"" &gt; Link Summon ""Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss"" &gt; Trigger Graff &gt; Summon ""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"" &gt; Activate Cherubini, send ""The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak"" for cost. Special Summon ""The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche"" using Cherubini and Cir &gt; Trigger Cir, Special Summon Cherubini.</em><br />Tour Guide is just one of the different ways you'll be able to access this board.<em> </em>This setup is very powerful as it grants you access to effectively your whole Phantom Knights engine.<em> </em>This opening play also allows you to misdirect your opponent as to what deck you are playing, which can lead them to make poorly optimized decisions in their attempt to disrupt your turn.</p><p>There's many different routes from here to take to get to the end which are all dependent on the rest of your opening hand, but I will continue to go over a very straightforward route given our current game state.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Torn Scales + Stained Greaves</strong></p></li></ul><p><em>Activate Rusty Bardiche &gt; Send ""The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales"" to the GY, set ""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"" to your field. Activate Ancient Cloak in your GY &gt; Add ""The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves"" to your hand. Trigger Torn Scales in your GY &gt; Special Summon it to your field &gt; Trigger Stained Greaves in your hand, Special Summon it to your field, do not increase its level. Activate Torn Scales, discard a card for cost and send ""Phantom Knights' Wing"" from your deck to your GY. Xyz Summon ""Leviair the Sea Dragon"" using Stained Greaves and Torn Scales &gt; Activate Leviair, detaching Torn Scales for cost &gt; Summon Ancient Cloak. Activate PK Wing in your GY &gt; Summon Torn Scales &gt; Xyz Summon ""The Phantom Knights of Break Sword"" using Torn Scales and Ancient Cloak &gt; Xyz Summon ""Number F0: Utopic Future"" using Leviair and Break Sword &gt; Special Summon ""Number F0: Utopic Draco Future"" using Utopic Future as the full material. </em><br />This is a very powerful endboard. Provided that your opponent did not disrupt you during certain key moments of your combo, you can easily achieve this end board with pretty much any combination of the cards listed above as well as the different extenders the deck plays. This board gets stronger if you can get an additional PK trap card in your GY. That would allow you to use your Utopic Draco Future to negate by detaching the Break Sword, and during your opponnet's turn you can use the additional PK trap card in your GY to bring back Break Sword to a zone Bardiche points to. This provides an additional point of disruption on your opponent's turn.</p><p>Again, this deck is capable of producing this board with pretty much any combination of two level 3 monsters. There's going to be times where you draw in to Stained Greaves. Using Ancient Cloak to get ""The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots"" into rotation alleviates a lot of potential bricking. Alongside the Psychic monsters in ""Psychic Wheelder"" and ""Psychic Tracker"" giving you follow-up if your opponent negates your Tour Guide or Torn Scales.</p><p>I'll lay out some examples of what your combo might look like provided you do not open with Tour Guide.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Any PK + a Psychic Monster or ""Emergency Teleport""</strong></p></li></ul><p>For this specific example I'll use Ancient Cloak.</p><p><em>Normal Summon Ancient Cloak &gt; Special Summon Psychic by available means &gt; Link Summon Cherubini with Ancient Cloak and the Psychic &gt; Activate Cherubini, sending Graff from your deck &gt; Trigger Graff &gt; Summon Cir &gt; Link Summon Rusty Bardiche using Cir and Cherubini &gt; Trigger Cir &gt; Summon Cherubini from your GY.</em> This combo here will put you right back on track to be able to perform the combos listed above. A similar version of this combo can be performed with Silent Boots and an additional PK in your oppening hand. You can also sometimes omit the Rusty Bardiche from your combo if you don't have the resourced to faciliate it and still end on a Utopic Draco Future and Cherubini.</p><p>In these different starting situations, there will be different points through your combo where you have PKs like Silent Boots in your GY which you will be able to banish to add ""The Phantom Knights' Fog Blade"" from your deck for an extra negate on your opponent's turn with the added benefit of preventing that monster from declaring attacks.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Torn Scales + Silent Boots</strong></p></li></ul><p><em>Normal Summon Torn Scales &gt; Activate Torn Scales, discarding for cost &gt; Send Phantom Knights' Wing to the GY. &gt; Special Summon Silent Boots &gt; Link Summon Cherubini with Torn Scales + Boots. Activate Cherubini &gt; Send Graff &gt; Trigger Graff &gt; Summon Cir from deck </em><strong>(</strong><strong>note: you do not want to send Graff if you drew into Cir. Instead send Ragged Gloves from deck and then Special Summon Cir from hand and continue combo as follows)</strong> <em>&gt; Link Summon Rusty Bardiche with Cir + Cherubini </em><strong>(note: if you summoned Cir from deck off of Graff, trigger their effect to summon back the Cherubini.)</strong><em> &gt; Bardiche Effect, send Ancient Cloak from deck to GY, set Shade Brigandine from deck. &gt; Ancient Cloak Effect &gt; Add Stained Greaves &gt; Trigger Torn Scales to Special Summon &gt; Trigger Stained Greaves to Special Summon &gt; Xyz Summon Leviair &gt; Activate Leviair detaching Torn Scales to Special Summon Ancient Cloak &gt; Activate PK Wing in GY to Special Summon Torn Scales &gt; Xyz Summon Break Sword using Ancient Cloak and Torn Scales &gt; Xyz Summon Utopic Future using Break Sword + Leviair &gt; Xyz Summon Utopic Draco Future using Utopic Future.</em><em><br /></em></p><p>This is another way you're going to be accessing your endboard. With one more piece of extension like an E Tele/Psychic, we'd easily be able to use the set Shade Brigandine to turn into a Link Spider which combined with one of the Psychic monsters can be used to Link into Union Carrier, allowing you to establish your Buster Lock. This line also will put a Silent Boots in your GY which you can activate to get a Fog Blade from deck to give you another piece of disruption for your opponent's turn.</p><h3><strong>Alterations &amp; Final Thoughts<br /></strong></h3><hr /><p>Our Extra Deck boss monsters will act as a sort of toolbox that you can rely on to help break different types of boards. Making Utopic Draco Future is generally your best option for Turn 1 as it has a good amount of protection built-in to the card, as well as offering a monster negate that also has the possibility to permanently take control of a monster your opponent controls. For turn 2 plays, you can do things like make Knightmare Unicorn to potentially get rid of a monster that has destruction protection, or to get rid of a problematic piece of your opponent's backrow. Knightmare Unicorn can be easily made into Accesscode Talker, which will be able to gain 3000 ATK by using its on-summon Trigger Effect to target the Unicorn that was used for its summon. Accesscode will give you the ability to pick apart boards and close out games. The Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon can be easily made with Raider's Knight. We can use The Phantom Knights of Break Sword with 2 PK materials to destroy itself and a card your opponent controls with its effect. Using the Break Sword in the GY to revive 2 PKs and increase their levels by 1 gives you a clear line directly into Raider's Knight and then Arc Rebellion XYZ Dragon. Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder is there to solidify some games by having the opponent low on resources and being able to threat any crawl they can make back into the game with a Quick Effect board wipe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are many alternatives to different monsters played in this deck. For example, you could also utilize the Dark Xyz Dragons by summoning them off of the Phantom Knights Rank-Up Magic spell cards. You can also choose to utilize something like Predaplant Verte Anaconda + Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer with Artifact Scythe. There's plenty of other alternatives you can play around with, including different extenders like Kagemucha Knight or Junk Forward.

(Looking at you Dragonmaids), well, join the maidenless combatants in this list.","<p>They're back from their 2010s glory with a fresh coat of ""wait, Andal's actually bad"" paint and a theme park sheen that'll probably convince opponents that this thing's actually pretty competitive. The spell and trap line-up should definitely change with each iteration of the format and any future releases; however, the core that's presented here is probably long-standing enough to supplement future variants. Let's get into the list.<br /><br /><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Safety Nets: The sheer amount of disruption and answer cards we're running in this list make it so that our plays are usually insulated in some way. We should never, ever really be in any remote danger during a game as long as we have a Gladiator Beast and a backline to back them up.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Amazement Engine: This engine isn't the best, but it's definitely non-intrusive and cycles through enough psuedo-disruption and removal that's relevant enough to run parallel to our gameplan here. Honestly, this archetype goes hand-in-hand with Gladiator Beasts as a whole. Just mind your normal summon.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>No Andal!: Rescue Rabbit openers and lines are great for getting into Panther or Dragases or setting up a three material fusion but boy did it suck drawing into that card and not having it be able to tag out like the others. Well, there's none of that anymore. We've compromised the Andal combos and random chance of drawing into Rescue Rabbit before it in the interest of having more playable hands overall. Just protect your guy(s) and run over the opponents. There's no need for any fancy business.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>They're all Garnets; All of them. Opening a Gladiator Beast will probably have you saying ""man, I wish this one stayed in the deck or was another Gladiator Beast."" That's basically this deck's entire experience and why we're only playing the ones that matter. Sadly, that little dilemma will always remain in this deck and there isn't much to be done about it outside of Contact Fusing or bringing out Augustus. It feels even worse that a Trinity is being spent on Proving Ground just to increase the odds of finding a Glad, especially in a pinch. Pick a Glad and pray.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Extra Deck: The Extra Deck will usually be useless sometimes if you find yourself in a situation where you need to break down a board before you start committing to anything flashy. It's for this reason that we're not on any Extra Deck Trinities here and I'd personally advise against it. Fortunately, this does also mean that we're pretty insulated against cards like Titanocider which is pretty popular this format.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Forehead Girl is an FTK: Ash solos. Godspeed.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Now with that out of the way, let's get into some of the demo setups you'll be wanting to aim for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br /><br /><strong>OPENERS</strong><br /><br />This list isn't about finding gas, it's about opening defenses and protecting your Gladiator. You'll ideally be wanting to always go first. If you're going with no backup, I'd strongly encourage just combat tricking out the opponent. There isn't any specific opener you'll want to look for since Gladiator Beasts take on a midrange playstyle here (without Andal anyway), so your opening hands determine your line of play. Here's a few pointers though if you're inexperienced with them or the Amazement engine:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Phalanx: </strong>Control a Gladiator Beast and protect them with backrow. If there's something you can use to either change a monster's battle position to make them vulnerable on your turn or modify combat stats so your monster will survive the attack, that's ideal.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The Blender:</strong> The Amazement engine does well to shake up the usual flow of some games. If you happen upon a Ticket and you're not sure what to do with it entirely, going for Comica and setting Horror House is perfectly fine. If you know you'll be able to beat the monster you book, then you can resolve it on the opponent's monster. If you're confident you can get a lot more mileage out of Comica, use Horror House during the Draw Phase and equip it directly to her. This will enable her to act as a monster negate or book of moon on the dime. I recommend trying to be greedy with Comica when possible, especially if you have back row to back her up. Cashing in for the set effect from Horror House is great too, but the monster effect negation is basically infinite for as long as you can maintain it. Grabbing Coaster or Arlekino are fine as well. Arlekino should primarily be used as a means of removal more than just being a body. You don't really need those in this deck.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Ob-Noxious:</strong> If you've opened Noxious and backrow, feel free to set those cards and outright pass. Usually people will just attack you outright, so you punish with Noxious. Bin either something you want to bring back with Darius (who Noxious will tag out into after) or bin something you don't want to draw, like Augustus. Tag as appropriate.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />The openers aren't always ideal and will vary from game-to-game, especially post-siding. The main thing to do is plan ahead. Measure your options and weigh your forms of interaction well. Everything in your deck is an extremely limited resource and this deck lacks card draw.<br /><br /><strong>MIDGAME<br /></strong><br /><br />This is where Gladiator Beasts shine really. You'll be doing your best Unchained-meets-Dragonmaid impression here... despite preceding both of those archetypes. Hmm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Bestiari: </strong>Your Spell/Trap removal. This card's also really important for making Gyzarus who is your Icarus Attack on-summon. S/T hate's pretty restricted across the board in Trinity format and most decks only rely on generics to get it done. Since Glad Beasts tag out often, you have this form of removal going for you on top of the generic removal you're already running here. It's worth noting that this card's effect to destroy is mandatory, so don't summon it willy-nilly otherwise you might end up having to pop your own backline.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Murmillo: </strong>Your Monster removal. This card's your go-to for checking the board and clearing potential threats. Its combat stats leave much to be desired, but it doesn't have to partake in combat if it's already won now has it? Use it for fusion material when you can, or take an open attack. Don't get greedy with the fish.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The Tag Team:&nbsp;</strong>Gladiator Beast War Chariot's an amazing Counter Trap and since most win conditions in Trinity format revolve around Monster effects, having access to this is nothing to scoff at. Samnite grabs this for you and Equeste loops this for you. Loop these two as necessary to keep up the War Chariot pressure and you'll have your opponent on the ropes.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Games should usually resolve themselves by midgame due to all of the removal, but Gladiator Beasts can definitely go into a late or grind game.<br /><br /><strong>LATEGAME &amp; CLOSERS<br /></strong><br /><br />The killing blow. Leave absolutely no room for a comeback. This is the Gladiator's Proving Ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Secutor: </strong>Resolving Secutor once basically wins the game on the spot. Resolving it during the opponent's turn? Well, that's probably traumatizing to say the least. Ideally you'll be wanting to bring out those that are all-stars in the midgame (as listed above); however, if you're ready to go in for the kill, summon out Laquari or Vespasius instead for fusion setups we'll cover just below.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Domitianus: </strong>Monster effect activation negation with no cost whatsoever and dictates who attacks who during your opponent's turn? Make this when you know it's a valid win condition. Just keep in mind that it only tags out into only 1 other Gladiator Beast. This card is really bad to use mid game as a result since, if it would fall, you would be put severely behind for the contact fusion play. Don't be greedy with Domitianus.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Heraklinos: </strong>Your Spell/Trap activation negation station. This card ain't even once per turn. As long as you have cards to discard, you can keep up the suffocation against your opponent. Unfortunately, this card doesn't have a tag out nor a float, so it should be used exclusively as a finisher where you're confident it will win. If it happens to get removed, you'll be set back pretty far.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><br />The most important thing to note about this list is that any and all Spell/Traps selected here can and should be experimented with and swapped out to fit your playstyle with the deck in a given format. This is not a one size fits all situation and due to the variance concerning the hands, the learning curve with deciphering the best way to spend one's opening turns is definitely pretty steep. Regardless, here's a handful of ideas just to throw your way should you aim to adjust this baseline into something more focused elsewhere:<br /><br /><em>Melffy engine with Andal, Traptrix/Gokipole engine, Trinities on Gladiator Beast's Comeback, Geartown engine, Loop of Destruction, Ancient Warriors - Ambitious Cao De, Amazement Ambassador Bufo, Amazement Precious Park, Archfiend's Staff of Despair, Gladiator Beast's Battle Manica, Burden of the Mighty<br /></em><br /><br />Thanks for reading, and I hope this has convinced you to give the deck a try! This deck's a classic in Yu-Gi-Oh! history and it's honestly incredible to see it in a playable state in modern Trinity's climate. But don't just take my word for it- step on up into the Colosseum to Disarm, Parry, and Lash out against any and all who oppose your bestial fury!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

GX we get to see Yugis deck a total of 3 times, 2 not counting Jadens graduation duel against Yugi as there was some time shananigans involved in that and Jaden ended up facing off against an earlier incarnation of Yugi, one not yet seperated from Atem, so we can just ignore cards shown in that duel,</p><p>The other two times that Yugis deck was shown was when his actual deck was ""going on tour"" and in the last few episodes of GX where there <span>was a replica of Yugis deck that was to be given to the student who did the best in the graduation Duels, plus we know he had Winged K</span><span>uriboh because he gave it to Jaden in episode 1 of GX after it fell out from his deck.</span></p><p><span>I've chosen to use all the cards we saw in his actual deck <strong>and</strong> in the replica to get the best and most complete version of his final deck (not counting cards from the Dark Side of Dimensions movie because that is a continuation of the Manga, not the anime, so I'm pretty sure that's not cannon and Pyramid of light obviously takes place before Yugi and the Pharoh seperate).</span></p><p><span>Anyway since Yugis deck has a lot of bricks as it is I chose to mainly add cards that would help him play defensively and stall, and side deck the rest, but I did chose to add BLS Envoy of The Begining over Gazel or Lightforce Sword which would be better defensively because this deck could use a more reliable/easy to summon boss monster than </span><span>Valkyrion or the Level monsers,</span></p><p><span>I chose to exclude the Dark Magician family of cards because Yugi not using, or drawing, any of them in his duel against the Pharoh seems to imply that he removed them from the deck or side decked them,<br />I could have put them in since they are shown as part of his deck later, but I prefer this thematically, the lack of any Dark Magician cards in this deck symbolising Yugi coming out of the Pharohs shadow since that really does feel more like the Pharohs ace monster than Yugis, <br />Plus they could just be prominantly displayed in the replica and while on tour because they are iconic, for all we know Yugi might not even use them anymore, or maybe he does, who knows :P</span></p><p><span>Anyway this has been my interpretation of Yugis final deck, I hope you like it!</span></p><p><span>P.S. the cards that were not confirmed in the final duel but I added are all the ones behind soul rope</span></p>"

","<p>This is my first upload, and any criticism is welcome.</p><p>Tenshi, if you are reading this, here is a simple guide to the deck:</p><p>The deck's goal is simple, to get your large tribute-summoned bodies in the form of Erebus the Underworld Monarch, and Ehther the heavenly Monarch on the field, while having the field spell Domain of Monarch active to lock your opponent out of their extra deck. Erebus's effect is on tribute summon; they send two monarch spells and traps from your hand or deck to the graveyard to shuffle one card your opponent control/ in their hand/ in their graveyard back to their deck. Ehther's effect is mostly similar to Erebus, but they summon a monster from the deck with 2400/2800 atk with 1000 def instead; usually, you would want to summon Kuraz the light Monarch to destroy cards your opponent control, or Delg the shadow monarch to banish cards in their graveyard.</p><p>To facilitate the summon of Erebus and Ehther, you have Eda the heavenly Squire, and Eidos the Underworld squire as your go-to tribute summon fodder. Eda will summon Eidos from the deck, which grants you an additional normal summon so that you can tribute summoned the big Monarchs to all your heart's content. You can get to both the Squires and the big Monarchs through the various spells this deck has, such as Pantheism of the Monarch help you two draw cards by discarding a monarch spell card; Return of the Monarch lets you search for any big Monarch from your deck as you conduct your tribute summon, and Tenacity of the Monarch allowing you to search both Pantheism and Return from your deck by revealing a big Monarch in your hand. The other cards in the deck are Stormforth, Prime Monarch, and Escalation. The Monarch Stormforth allows you to tribute summon over one of your opponent's monsters, helping you to get rid of hard to get rid of monsters. Prime Monarch is a continuous trap that allows you to shuffle your banished Monarch spell and traps back to your deck and draw cards, as well as summon itself from the graveyard as a monster by banishing a Monarch spell/trap from your grave. Erupt allows you to tribute summon a monster in your opponent's main or battle phases. Finally, the most important card of the deck is Domain of the Monarch, a field spell that locks your opponent from summoning extra deck monsters and lowers your big Monarch's level so they can be summoned with less tribute.</p><p>The other cards of the decks are my tech choices. Vanity's fiend and Majesty Fiend are big tribute-summoned monsters that work alongside the Monarch spell/traps, whose effects are to lock your opponent out of special summoning monsters or activate monster's effects. Reinforcement of the army and One-for-one lets you get to Eda easier. Uncamoflight and Upstart Goblin let you draw more cards, while Uncamoflight also acts as a tribute summoned fodder if you have no monster in your extra deck.</p><p>That was my short guide; feel free to ask any questions. Oh, and the deck can be readily built in Master Duel.</p>"

Don't forget to trigger effects as much as possible to maximise card advantage &amp; follow-up plays.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't open with Abanc in your hand instead of Curburrel, you can make the basic combo by Normal Summoning Abanc instead of discarding it, then using its GY effect to discard the Abanc you search off of Cupid Pitch and summon itself to make a L10 Synchro.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3><strong>Raiden:</strong></h3><p>What you need: <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=77558536"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/77558536.jpg"" data-card=""77558536"" data-name=""Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn"">Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn</span></a>&nbsp;OR <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=94886282"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/94886282.jpg"" data-card=""94886282"" data-name=""Charge of the Light Brigade"">Charge of the Light Brigade</span></a>, any 1 Runick QPS</p><p>This combo is far more reliant on luck but has a higher ceiling, however, it usually gives you the resources to keep extending into a powerful endboard anyway. Start by searching Raiden and summoning him (or just summoning him), then use the mill effect. If you milled a copy of Fountain or drew it in your opening hand, you're in a great position. In this case, summon Geri and use its effect to recycle the Fountain to your hand (if applicable). Then, summon Chaos Ruler and immediately use its effect. Ideally, you'll excavate one each of both Fabled tuners or have one in your opening hand (I'll explain what to do if not). Add Cerburrel to your hand and let Abanc go to the GY. Then, use Abanc's GY effect to get both tuners on the field, go into Baronne with Cerburrel &amp; Chaos Ruler, then banish Geri and Cerburrel from the GY to summon back Chaos Ruler and go into Chengying. This is ideal because it only requires 1 QPS to be activated and feild the GY with QPS to recycle for draws. From here you can attempt to draw more cards from the many cards</p><p>If you don't mill or draw a copy of Fountain, summon Hugin to search for it, then summon Coral Dragon and Synchro climb into Chaos Ruler to mill + draw 1, then use the card you have to extend/draw as much as possible. Even if you don't end on a powerful L10 Synchro monster, you can still end up drawing many interruptions in your hand and frequently end on Maxx ""C"".&nbsp;</p><p>If you do have Fountain, but don't have access to the Fabled tuners, the low-effort climb into Chaos Ruler should give you the resources to either deep draw into interruption or into the missing parts you needed to keep extending. The combos here are very versatile.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h2><strong>Tech Choices:</strong></h2><p>You might expect to see a LOT of Runick players in Master Duel, which is where <strong>Munin the Runick Wings</strong> &amp; <strong>Runick Allure</strong> come into play. Munin acts as great protection in the mirror match with its ability to negate a targeting effect &ndash; very useful when your opponent is trying to out your Fountain. Additionally, the discard to search Allure can be used on a Fabled tuner to help you extend your plays. Allure applies a lot of passive pressure in the mirror match as your opponent will constantly trigger it, giving them the difficult choice between outing Allure and outing Fountain (even then, you can recycle it with Geri). Finally, Allure gives you even more opportunities to trigger Chengying no matter what deck you're against. However, I wouldn't recommend Allure in any other Runick build unless you play to constantly benefit off of the discard costs of the searcher monsters as it can often make a winning position better rather than put you into a winning position.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instant Fusion</strong> is effectively a free Runick Fusion monster that doesn't need to go to the EMZ. This helps you play through interruption and gives you more extension options. Geri will never be destroyed by the effect, so you can keep the extra body on board and give your opponent a hard time if they attack over it. Munin will give you the 1000LP back at the end phase and can be summoned back by Baronne if you used its negate in your first turn as it was special summoned properly. Hugin will send itself back into the Extra Deck. And finally, when Frecki the Runick Fangs is released in Master Duel, it will be able to grab one of your milled QPS from the GY on destruction (Updated Deck profile coming when it is released).</p><p><strong>Knightmare Phoenix</strong> is a defensive choice against cards like Anti-Spell Fragrence that completely shut down your deck. If you see a card like that activated, use a QPS in response to it to summon a monster such as Hugin, then summon any other monster (usually a tuner) and go into Phoenix to deal with your threat. You might face other interruptions from your opponent, but this is your best shot against blowout cards like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stardust Charge Warrior</strong> is useful for when you need that extra card now and not later. If you have Raiden, Curburrel, and only 1 QPS, you can Synchro climb via Charge Warrior into Chaos Ruler to potentially get the extra QPS you need. Additionally, if you have exhausted many of your options or need to clear the EMZ, you can use a L2 tuner with Geri to get a bigger body and a draw. This can be helpful if you're trying to get Geri into the GY to banish off of Chaos Ruler.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h2><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks:</strong></h2><p><strong>Always chose the order of your QPS as you're stacking them on the bottom of the deck</strong> &ndash; <em>it can come up in grind games and it's helpful to prevent clumping of cards with the same name.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Always order your chains optimally</strong> &ndash; <em>usually using Fountain in CL1 and the Fusion monster effects in CL2 is better, but there may come times when the reverse yield better results via either chain blocking or by increasing the number of cards you will draw with worse hands.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>When deciding what QPS to activate to summon a monster, use the ones you run fewer copies of</strong> &ndash; <em>this makes it far less likely that you'll draw another copy of it to sit dead in your hand.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When discarding a QPS, discard one you have multiple copies of in hand (or if not, in deck)</strong> &ndash; <em>this allows you to benefit off of otherwise unusable cards, or prevent cards you draw later from being dead in hand.</em></p><p><strong>You don't always have to combo</strong> &ndash; <em>while doing a load of plays is fun, sometimes you'll have to take it slow and play as a control deck; chosing the right times to combo and the right times to control will always be rewarding.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Don't get cocky</strong> &ndash; <em>always play with the worst-case scenario in mind; you might not draw/mill the tuners/QPS you were hoping for. Before doing something, ask yourself what you can do if a play gets interrupted or a draw/mill whiffs.</em></p><p><strong>ALWAYS attempt to conduct your Battle Phase</strong> &ndash; <em>your battle phase skip only applies if you try to conduct it; make sure to try when you can so that you can conduct it in the next turn if possible, this will speed up your games.</em></p><p><strong>Activate QPS in the Battle Phase where applicable</strong> &ndash; <em>once you're in the battle phase, feel free to activate as many QPS as you like; you'll be limited to what you can do here at times but it can be helpful to clear your opponent's board and attack for game a turn early (and even be done just to boost Chengying's ATK).</em></p><p><strong>Don't be afraid to play the long haul</strong> &ndash; <em>sometimes attacking just isn't viable; your deck has multiple win conditions for a reason.</em>&nbsp;</p><hr /><h2><strong>Thanks for reading my deck profile and enjoy ruining&nbsp;</strong><strong>someone's day on Master Duel!</strong></h2><p><em>PS: For some reason halfway through writing this profile, the card search function stopped working :(</em></p><hr /><p>Edit: <em>Formatting</em></p>"

Regardless of the banning of Mystic Mine and the unphased limitations of the rest of the archetypes cards (Hornet Drones and Engage perspectively), ""Sky Striker"" is still a top notch challenger for rogue competitions for it's prestige in spell economics and deck resourcing. However the main issue is when your hand becomes your own demise, as it is sometimes known that the archetype jams itself or goes empty handed in the most crucial phases of duels. Hence why there has been a call for both Hornet Drones and Engage to either Semi or Unlimited in recent years in order to combat the ever eroding issues that have been occurring since the end of Master Rule 4. However I am not the one to decide Raye's entire fate alone (and neither is the intellectuals this community has that think they know everything about the game).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;""Runick"" on the other hand is a nice little addition of the game that plays for itself. Like in previous builds me and many others did, the cards utilize in making annoying effects and banishing top cards from your opponents deck in exchange for your battle phase. How this accommodates with the current state of the game is like taking out a tumor before it spreads, even if you didn't know you have it. As like ""Sky Striker"" the Mystic Mine ban did hit the deck, but ""Runick"" took a worst toll as it was their best flootgate option. Regardless, ""Runick"" builds like the standard and ""Spright"" variants remain playable to this very day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So how does this add up on how ""Runick - Sky Striker"" came to be? If I have to be honest with you, this is a ""Sky Striker"" deck that Utilizes in the ""Runick"" engine. Allowing monsters like Kagari and Shizuku to manipulate your opponents monsters attack much more quickly with the ""Runick"" spells in your GY. Not to mention the ""Sky Striker"" quick-play spells being used with Runick Allure to milling additional cards each turn is also a plus. And if you want to get more ridiculous, you could slap in Photon Strike Bounzer to your side deck alongside your Bystial monsters for that monster negate and burn damage.</p>"

Triple tact is very strong, an opponent negating anything you do (likely in tear due to Rulkallos) give you a massive boon. Droplet isn't the strongest this format, with most effects occuring in the grave, but is still really good, negating a Kitkallos or a Spright effect is really strong and it can also be used as a chain ender, if you destroy the right card type.</p><p>In the side deck, I am running 2 spellbound and 3 Dimensional Barrier. I really like these cards this format, denying fusion from being summoned is super strong and Barrier locks out Tear from doing most plays. Spellbound is definitely worse, but is a spell and can stop link and XYZ plays at the same time, limiting the impact Tear, Spright and the Bystials can have on the field</p><p>Other deck choices you can run include Artifact Scythe + Sanctum, or running Twin Twister as apposed to Cosmic Cyclone with Dagda, Metaverse + Necrovalley to lockout Tear even more (personally dont like this option as it stops Kagari from retrieving spells from the grave and screws with the Bystials and Shark Cannon), Kashtira Fenrir (unlike Pankratops, it cant destroy itself, limiting your plays a lot so i dont like this) and a multitude of other options.</p><p>Personally, I love this deck and I always love seeing it played. I hope it cant be useful this format, though i doubt it's strengths will be able to stand to the Ishizu Tear might</p>"

It may look like there are a lot of spells for a deck dedicated to turning them off, but 8 of these are 1 card starters to put a LIGHT Fairy on the board without normal summoning, Fusion Destiny is going to be (hopefully) activated from deck with Verte, which circumvent's Invicil's effect, and Pot of Greed/Graceful Charity are too good as consistency boosters to not include.</p><p>Invicil also has some unique strengths as a Deckmaster for Domain format, in that she provides access to EARTH, DARK, and LIGHT (arguably the three best attributes in the game), as well as Fairy and Fiend types, which both provide a number of useful generic cards like the Knightmare link monsters and the Runick package.</p><p>Domain is a 60 card singleton format in which your deck must be themed around a single monster card, the ""Deck Master"".
