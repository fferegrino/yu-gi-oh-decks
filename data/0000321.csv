The main goal here is to work the two parts together to create a board of heavy hitters that can overwhelm your opponent. Cards like Branded Opening and Fusion Deployment can help get your combos started, being able to get certain Gate Guardian pieces in play or into the graveyard, and fetching Branded Fusion or Branded in Red. The Gate Guardian monsters (Namely Gate Guardians Combined and Gate Guardian of Wind and Water) can help protect your monsters from various targeting and spell/trap effects, while Mirrorjade can deal with monsters by banishing them or destroying them if it leaves the field. Despian Quaeritis and Gate Guardian of Water and Thunder can reduce a monster's attack points to stop them from attacking your monsters as well as help trigger Labyrinth Wall Shadow's destruction ability. There is also the possibility of using Blazing Cartesia to go into Granguignol the Dusk Dragon which in turn can get you into one of Quaeritis or even Luluwalilith. Overall the deck works a lot better than I thought it would, but it is vulnerable to being interrupted, and if a board is broken, it's not the easiest to recover.</p>"

Usually if the opponent is able to get pass your P.U.N.K combo, Thunder Dragons' amazing recylability will net the win. Work in progress, the extra deck is iffy with Zombie Vampire (used to have more Thunder Dragons I could special if milled) and really not sure about psy-frame hand trap, unless you have enough material for Lambda, because it can basically be a brick. Admittedly, shotgun Maxx C or Ash into a free Chaos Ruler is very nice when the time comes. Also might switch Allure for Chicken Game, but the last couple of games have been spright outting my board and I only have ~5k life points after doing the PUNK combo so I'm unsure. Fun deck all the same, Thunder Dragons and PUNKs are definitely in my top 3 archetypes so I love to use them together.</p>"

The first is important once you have to use destruction Venus to recover your shineballs and the second is simply due to there being many combolines that potentially allow you to bait many handtraps or ressources and still get to a decent endboard.</li><li>With a decent hand you will generally have extra shineballs to make I:P Masquerena and the other Extras, while the minimum endboard is generally Masterflare, Elf and a synchro 10.&nbsp;</li><li>You will notice that the Countertrap search often has to be ditched inorder to get the extenders you need, but usually thats alright, if you can fill your hand with Orangelight or other handtraps.</li><li>Considering Runick is heavily played, I tend to go for Chengying instead of Baronne, if i can end on the Counter Trap or a Herald of the Arc Light to have <strong>at least </strong>1 omni negate.</li><li>The Ishizu cards are basically there to serve as 1. Link fodder if you can special summon them 2. Tribute fodder for Trias for the card draw 3. Filling the GY with Diviner, Majesty, Trias, Eva or Neptune 4. Reshuffling your own Shine Balls to keep extending 5. Get a peak at what the opponent is playing.</li><li>Once you have Neptune in Hand your mills become your second hand since you can special summon any Agent you milled.</li><li>Sadly the deck bricks every now and then, which is just natural if you play 3 Garnets and the mills can go wrong if you need them to hit well, but it just happens from time to time.</li><li>The interaction between Orange Light and Eva will many times give you the starter or extender you need.</li><li><strong>Handtraps:</strong> The deck <em>can</em> bait many Handtraps - especially with the Ishizu cards (many ash the millers and if they dont the mills can be useful) BUT it can die to an <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=14558127"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/14558127.jpg"" data-card=""14558127"" data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></a>&nbsp;or <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59438930"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59438930.jpg"" data-card=""59438930"" data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</span></a>&nbsp;if your hand doesn't have any follow up.

Basically, access to Isolde and a Level 5 Synchro is fully combo for the Deck and the plays are pretty simple.</span></p><p><span>2&nbsp;<strong>Super Quantum Red Layer</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Neo Space Connector</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</strong> to get to Isolde. 2<strong> Immortal Phoenix Gearfried</strong> which is a monster negate and it is very easy to Summon. You don't need to search it as you have pretty much enough interruption in your basic combo already, but it is another addition to your end-board if you do happen to draw it. 2&nbsp;<strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong> for extension. 3 <strong>Infernoble Knight - Oliver</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ogier</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Renaud</strong>. Renaud is great for extension, as a Summon off of Isolde, and he can grab back something like <strong>Living Fossil</strong> for more extension. Oliver is another extender and he can make himself into an equip which is important for this Deck. Ogier has more usage with the new Infernoble support, so having something that can foolish an equip or a FIRE Warrior is great with the new grave effects. Also, he can also make himself an equip which is important as we need at least 1 monster who can make themselves an equip in our starting combo. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ricciardetto</strong>. Drawing him is fine as he can basically make Isolde pretty easily depending on your starting hand if you do draw him, but he is also a pretty good Summon off of Isolde as well since he can reborn a FIRE Warrior on summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Turpin</strong> which is a free summon from hand or GY if you control an equip and he can also make himself an equip.</span></p><p><span>For Spells and Traps, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Heritage of the Chalice</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> to search our stuff. 3<strong> Infernoble Arms - Durendal</strong>, 2<strong> Infernoble Arms - Almace</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Arms - Joyeuse</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>The Infernoble Arms Museum</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade,&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Living Fossil</strong>. Durendal searches a Level 5 or lower FIRE Warrior. Almace can equip a different Infernoble Arms from Deck. Joyeuse can add back a FIRE Warrior from GY. Noble Arms Museum searches a Noble Arms card and specials a Noble Knight that is currently an equip.</span></p><p><span>ED: 1&nbsp;<strong>Baronne de Fluer</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Angelica, Princess of Noble Arms</strong>, 1 <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Charlemagne</strong>. Ricciardetto does Warrior lock you if you use his effect on Summon, and because you will be using that effect most of the time, you can't really play much outside of Warriors in your Extra Deck. If you aren't Warrior locked, you can make Masquerena with your extra bodies to go into Avramax or Unicorn. Angelica seraches Noble Arms Museum and if she is targeted, she can banish herself until the End Phase to foolish a FIRE Warrior from Deck and summon Captain Roland from your Extra Deck. You can target her with the effects of your Infernobles in GY that allows them to make themselves equips which then gets you to the rest of your combo. Charlemagne basically is another Charles after he equips Charles using his effect on Link Summon. Then, you can Summon your equipped Charles using Noble Arms Museum to have another body on field.</span></p><p><span>Side Deck can be whatever, but I would recommend board clearers and backrow removal for going second.</span></p><p><span>Full combo is simple: Make Isolde using whatever and dump Living Fossil to Summon out Ricciardetto. Ricciardetto revives a Level 4 non-Tuner FIRE Warrior which can be put into your GY through something like Ogier or Oliver. Synchro into Angelica and search Noble Arms Museum. Museum pay 1200 to add whatever Noble Arms you need or are missing. An Infernoble in GY targets Angelica to try to equip, and then chain Angelica to banish herself, dump Turpin, and Summon Captain Roland. Then, you can equip an Equip Spell to Roland so that you can Summon back Turpin. Synchro into Charles and equip Roland to him. Link that off into Charlemagne and effect to copy effects and equip Charles. Museum Summon out the equipped Charles. End Phase Angelica returns. If you were not Warrior locked, then you can get more bodies on field to make Masquerena, but it all depends on what you open.</span></p>"
