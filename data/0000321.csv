The main goal here is to work the two parts together to create a board of heavy hitters that can overwhelm your opponent. Cards like Branded Opening and Fusion Deployment can help get your combos started, being able to get certain Gate Guardian pieces in play or into the graveyard, and fetching Branded Fusion or Branded in Red. The Gate Guardian monsters (Namely Gate Guardians Combined and Gate Guardian of Wind and Water) can help protect your monsters from various targeting and spell/trap effects, while Mirrorjade can deal with monsters by banishing them or destroying them if it leaves the field. Despian Quaeritis and Gate Guardian of Water and Thunder can reduce a monster's attack points to stop them from attacking your monsters as well as help trigger Labyrinth Wall Shadow's destruction ability. There is also the possibility of using Blazing Cartesia to go into Granguignol the Dusk Dragon which in turn can get you into one of Quaeritis or even Luluwalilith. Overall the deck works a lot better than I thought it would, but it is vulnerable to being interrupted, and if a board is broken, it's not the easiest to recover.</p>"

Usually if the opponent is able to get pass your P.U.N.K combo, Thunder Dragons' amazing recylability will net the win. Work in progress, the extra deck is iffy with Zombie Vampire (used to have more Thunder Dragons I could special if milled) and really not sure about psy-frame hand trap, unless you have enough material for Lambda, because it can basically be a brick. Admittedly, shotgun Maxx C or Ash into a free Chaos Ruler is very nice when the time comes. Also might switch Allure for Chicken Game, but the last couple of games have been spright outting my board and I only have ~5k life points after doing the PUNK combo so I'm unsure. Fun deck all the same, Thunder Dragons and PUNKs are definitely in my top 3 archetypes so I love to use them together.</p>"

The first is important once you have to use destruction Venus to recover your shineballs and the second is simply due to there being many combolines that potentially allow you to bait many handtraps or ressources and still get to a decent endboard.</li><li>With a decent hand you will generally have extra shineballs to make I:P Masquerena and the other Extras, while the minimum endboard is generally Masterflare, Elf and a synchro 10.&nbsp;</li><li>You will notice that the Countertrap search often has to be ditched inorder to get the extenders you need, but usually thats alright, if you can fill your hand with Orangelight or other handtraps.</li><li>Considering Runick is heavily played, I tend to go for Chengying instead of Baronne, if i can end on the Counter Trap or a Herald of the Arc Light to have <strong>at least </strong>1 omni negate.</li><li>The Ishizu cards are basically there to serve as 1. Link fodder if you can special summon them 2. Tribute fodder for Trias for the card draw 3. Filling the GY with Diviner, Majesty, Trias, Eva or Neptune 4. Reshuffling your own Shine Balls to keep extending 5. Get a peak at what the opponent is playing.</li><li>Once you have Neptune in Hand your mills become your second hand since you can special summon any Agent you milled.</li><li>Sadly the deck bricks every now and then, which is just natural if you play 3 Garnets and the mills can go wrong if you need them to hit well, but it just happens from time to time.</li><li>The interaction between Orange Light and Eva will many times give you the starter or extender you need.</li><li><strong>Handtraps:</strong> The deck <em>can</em> bait many Handtraps - especially with the Ishizu cards (many ash the millers and if they dont the mills can be useful) BUT it can die to an <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=14558127"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/14558127.jpg"" data-card=""14558127"" data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</span></a>&nbsp;or <a class=""type-tuner-monster"" href=""/card/?search=59438930"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/59438930.jpg"" data-card=""59438930"" data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</span></a>&nbsp;if your hand doesn't have any follow up.

Basically, access to Isolde and a Level 5 Synchro is fully combo for the Deck and the plays are pretty simple.</span></p><p><span>2&nbsp;<strong>Super Quantum Red Layer</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Neo Space Connector</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</strong> to get to Isolde. 2<strong> Immortal Phoenix Gearfried</strong> which is a monster negate and it is very easy to Summon. You don't need to search it as you have pretty much enough interruption in your basic combo already, but it is another addition to your end-board if you do happen to draw it. 2&nbsp;<strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong> for extension. 3 <strong>Infernoble Knight - Oliver</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ogier</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Renaud</strong>. Renaud is great for extension, as a Summon off of Isolde, and he can grab back something like <strong>Living Fossil</strong> for more extension. Oliver is another extender and he can make himself into an equip which is important for this Deck. Ogier has more usage with the new Infernoble support, so having something that can foolish an equip or a FIRE Warrior is great with the new grave effects. Also, he can also make himself an equip which is important as we need at least 1 monster who can make themselves an equip in our starting combo. 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Ricciardetto</strong>. Drawing him is fine as he can basically make Isolde pretty easily depending on your starting hand if you do draw him, but he is also a pretty good Summon off of Isolde as well since he can reborn a FIRE Warrior on summon. 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight - Turpin</strong> which is a free summon from hand or GY if you control an equip and he can also make himself an equip.</span></p><p><span>For Spells and Traps, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Heritage of the Chalice</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Reinforcement of the Army</strong> to search our stuff. 3<strong> Infernoble Arms - Durendal</strong>, 2<strong> Infernoble Arms - Almace</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Arms - Joyeuse</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>The Infernoble Arms Museum</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade,&nbsp;</strong>and 1&nbsp;<strong>Living Fossil</strong>. Durendal searches a Level 5 or lower FIRE Warrior. Almace can equip a different Infernoble Arms from Deck. Joyeuse can add back a FIRE Warrior from GY. Noble Arms Museum searches a Noble Arms card and specials a Noble Knight that is currently an equip.</span></p><p><span>ED: 1&nbsp;<strong>Baronne de Fluer</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Infernoble Knight Captain Roland</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Angelica, Princess of Noble Arms</strong>, 1 <strong>Accesscode Talker</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>I:P Masquerena</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Charlemagne</strong>. Ricciardetto does Warrior lock you if you use his effect on Summon, and because you will be using that effect most of the time, you can't really play much outside of Warriors in your Extra Deck. If you aren't Warrior locked, you can make Masquerena with your extra bodies to go into Avramax or Unicorn. Angelica seraches Noble Arms Museum and if she is targeted, she can banish herself until the End Phase to foolish a FIRE Warrior from Deck and summon Captain Roland from your Extra Deck. You can target her with the effects of your Infernobles in GY that allows them to make themselves equips which then gets you to the rest of your combo. Charlemagne basically is another Charles after he equips Charles using his effect on Link Summon. Then, you can Summon your equipped Charles using Noble Arms Museum to have another body on field.</span></p><p><span>Side Deck can be whatever, but I would recommend board clearers and backrow removal for going second.</span></p><p><span>Full combo is simple: Make Isolde using whatever and dump Living Fossil to Summon out Ricciardetto. Ricciardetto revives a Level 4 non-Tuner FIRE Warrior which can be put into your GY through something like Ogier or Oliver. Synchro into Angelica and search Noble Arms Museum. Museum pay 1200 to add whatever Noble Arms you need or are missing. An Infernoble in GY targets Angelica to try to equip, and then chain Angelica to banish herself, dump Turpin, and Summon Captain Roland. Then, you can equip an Equip Spell to Roland so that you can Summon back Turpin. Synchro into Charles and equip Roland to him. Link that off into Charlemagne and effect to copy effects and equip Charles. Museum Summon out the equipped Charles. End Phase Angelica returns. If you were not Warrior locked, then you can get more bodies on field to make Masquerena, but it all depends on what you open.</span></p>"

Youtube Link inside!,"<div class=""elementToProof"">Branded currently is one of the top contenders for today's March 2023 meta. Able to consistently make gigantic fusion beatsticks with board clearing capabilities backed by a solid resource grindgame, Branded is currently the ultimate aggro-beatdown deck. Pushed into meta relevance by Konami because of it's fan favourite status as the ""lore"" deck of series 12, Branded post Photon Hypernova is a fusion powerhouse! </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">However, this Branded suffers from two major weaknesses: Ash Blossom (On esp. on Branded Fusion) and Nibiru. This version of Branded aims to fix that, by giving the pilot so much gas and plays to work with so that you can play through those devastating handtraps and eventually out-resource your opponent! This ""gas"" variant of Branded can keep playing, even though Branded Fusion is negated! Some hands allow the pilot to make Dragoon before you use Branded Fusion (so you can negate Ash) and before 5 summons (so you can negate Nibiru). </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Dragoon is especially strong in today's meta vs. many meta decks since they all target/destroy, meaning this overpowered Deviantart OC is a nigh-invincible instant-win button!</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof""><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>ARCHETYPES, ENGINES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></p></div></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">This core of this deck is composed of the traditional <strong>Branded </strong>and <strong>Despia </strong>cards. The only card that isn't standard is <strong>Dramaturge</strong>. I personally like to use Dramaturge since he can negate Mirrorjade if you're going first, which enables 2 uses of Mirrorjade's effect rather then 1 - thus getting you more dumps in the GY from the ED and more resources. 3 <strong>Tragedy</strong> is included as a banish target for Allure of Darkness (essentially a +1!). </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">The <strong>Bystial package</strong> is relatively small, since banishing Light/Dark monsters in the GY isn't very impactful and common in today's metagame. Lubellion is ""searcheable"" from deck since Branded Fusion dumps him to the GY,and Lubellion can summon itself from the GY by tributing the on-field Albion. Lubellion can activate from deck <strong>Branded Lost</strong> as extra protection/search power or <strong>Branded Beast</strong> for a quick effect pop during the main phase. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">The <strong>Frightfur package</strong> is included as another piece of ""gas"" in the deck - maintaining hand advantage since all the pieces search each other and giving access to Polymerization (a powerful boardbreaker with Guardian Chimera).</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> functions as a toolbox in this deck, since its 3 targets each serve a distinct function. <strong>Albaz </strong>can breakboards when summoned, and Albaz + Super Poly cracks most boards nowadays. If your opponent happens to field Dragon monsters, Albaz can contact fuse them away. <strong>Cartesia </strong>enables fusion summoning as a quick effect. Not only does she give access to Granguinol (which is a foolish burial), she can protect your activating monster effects on the field from targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler. Finally, <strong>Dark Magician</strong> can be summoned from deck if you have all the pieces for Dragoon, so that you can have access to his omni-negate to deter Ash/Nibiru before you full combo. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">50 cards are utilized in this deck rather than around 40ish since every important piece (esp. Branded Fusion) is highly searcheable anyways. 50 cards also reduces the likelihood of drawing garnets and bricks. This ""gas"" version of Branded is designed to draw alot, search alot, and to play alot to overwhelm any sort of interaction your opponent has whether it is Ash Blossom, Nibiru or on-board interruption. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">""Gas"" Branded is designed to play through your opponent's interruption to create gigantic fusion beatsticks and overwhelm with high ATK and massive resource generation. If given even a second of breathing space, your opponent will find that they are facing down a field full of powerful fusion monsters!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Branded Fusion is both a blessing and a curse for this strategy. The whole deck revolves around searching and resolving that card, and if it's negated, your further options are likely limited. Your obvious glaring chokepoint and weakness is Branded Fusion, so it is imperative that you can bait out the Ash Blossom or fusion summon Dragoon before you use the card. It is advisable to use every other card first like Frightfur Patchwork, Branded Opening or Lubellion so that you can bait out your opponent's Ash Blossom. Also, from experience playing the deck, I've discovered that people intentionally hold their Ash Blossom saving it for Branded Fusion - so if you don't have the card, you can bluff having it and just do all your searches/summons from deck!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">End boards are very hand dependant, but here are the mainline combos: </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><em>Branded Fusion + Dark Monster + Discard = Mirrorjade (banish), Bystial Lubellion + Beast (pop), Set Branded in Red </em></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Activate Branded Fusion to summon Albion, sending Albaz + Bystial Lubellion from deck.</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Fusion summon Lubellion the Searing Dragon by fusing Albaz + Dark Monster with Albion. Ideal dark monsters to banish are Tragedy (search) and Dramaturge (free body on field).</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Lubellion (discards for cost) fusion summons Mirrorjade by shuffling back Albaz from banished pile and Lubellion the Searing Dragon on the field. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">Summon Bystial Lubellion from the GY by tributing Albion. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">Activate Lubellion's card effect to activate from deck Branded Beast. Alternatively, you can activate from deck Branded Lost for further searches/fusion protection. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">End phase - set your Branded card of choice from deck. Ideally, you set Branded in Red so you can fusion summon on your opponent's turn. If you already have Branded in Red, you can set Branded Opening for further searches/protection from destruction.&nbsp;</li></ol><div class=""elementToProof""><em>Branded Fusion + Discard = Red-Eyes Dragoon (Best to use if you suspect your opponent has Nibiru, or you are against a Kashtira player, or if you want to play safe).</em></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Activate Branded Fusion to summon Lubellion the Searing Dragon, sending Albaz + Dark Magician from deck. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">Lubellion (discards for cost) fusion summons Dragoon by shuffling back Albaz and Dark Magician from GY to deck. </li></ol></div><div class=""elementToProof""><em>Cartesia + Light/Dark monster + Either Bystial Saronir/Albion the Shrouded Dragon = Search for any Branded card (Best to use if you're missing a particular Branded card, esp. Branded Fusion!) </em></div></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ol><li class=""elementToProof"">Activate Cartesia's effect to fusion summon Granguinol by using Cartesia + Light/Dark monster. If Saronir is in hand, you use Saronir instead.</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Granguinol sends to GY from deck Bystial Saronir. (Or Albion the Shrouded Dragon)</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Bystial Saronir/Albion the Shrouded Dragon sends to GY Branded Retribution.&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Bystial Saronir/Albion the Shrouded Dragon sends to GY your Branded spell/trap card of choice.&nbsp;</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Banish Branded Retribution from GY to retrieve from GY your Branded spell/trap of choice. </li></ol></div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going first and uninterrupted, your opponent will likely contend with Mirrorjade's banish, a pop with Branded Beast, and a set Branded in Red. Depending on the hand, your opponent may also be dealing with Mercourier's monster negate, Dramaturge's monster negate, Masquerade's -600 burn, and Granguinol can summon Proskenion from the Extra Deck. Red-Eyes Dragoon can also be summoned, a much needed omni-negate that Branded needs. If you're lucky, you also have a facedown Super Polymerization - a devasting turn ending card if used at the right time. Your hand will likely also be sizeable and ready with follow-up for next turn since Cartesia, Alba-Lenatus and Albion generate resources during the end phase. </div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Going second, Branded can slog through interruption, pierce through boards and beat down your opponent's monsters with big beatsticks. Branded is naturally equipped with in-engine ways to play going second. Polymerization fusing into Guardian Chimera is a nigh-unstoppable juggernaut since it's effect is often chainblocked with the fusion material used for it's fusion summon and it is untargetable since you used Polymerization. If Branded Opening is on the field, it also can't be destroyed! Super Polymerization can fuse away most boards in today's meta, especially with Garura, only needing 2 monsters with the same type and attribute. Muddy Mudragon can fuse away your Kashtira opponent's Diablosis + Ariseheart as well! Against the rare Dragon deck, Albaz can contact fuse their problematic Dragons away like Borrload Savage Dragon and Crystal Wing into Alba-Lenatus. Alot of interruption these days involve flipping monsters facedown, destroying and banishing (For example, Traptrix, Labrynth, Ninja and Kashtira does this alot) - Branded is very comfortable with that since they can fuse face down monsters and shuffle back banished monsters with Lubellion to fusion summon.</div><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ul><li class=""elementToProof"">Try to bait out Ash Blossom by your many searches/summons from deck before you use Branded Fusion. If you don't have Branded Fusion, your opponent will likely hold Ash Blossom in their hand waiting for it, so you can bluff having the card to search/summon all you want!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Branded lacks in-engine ways to remove backrow, except with Guardian Chimera. Backrow floodgates absolutely slaughter Branded, so if you're against an opponent using something like Rivalry of Warlords, it probably is time to proceed to next game! Be sure to side in backrow hate in those match-ups!</li><li class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;Guardian Chimera is the best card to crack open established boards. With it's untargetability, beefy 3300ATK/DEF statline and non-targeting destruction, most boards fall to this offensive juggernaut. If your opponent negates Polymerization/Branded in Red to prevent Chimera from coming out, they have wasted a precious interaction paving the way for you to use Branded Fusion.</li><li class=""elementToProof"">Try to have Cartesia on board before you summon monsters on the field with important effects. Cartesia's quick effect fusion summon allows you to dodge common targeting negates like Impermanence and Effect Veiler. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">The best cards to side out is the Bystial package, especially when the match-up doesn't call for them (for ex. Traptrix/Kashtira don't have light/dark for Bystials to banish). Super Polymerization can also be sided out in certain matchups where your Super Poly targets don't work out. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">If Branded Lost is active, Fusion effect's activation cannot be negated. Cards that negate the activation like Baronne De Fleur, Borreload Savage Dragon and even Solemn Judgment cannot negate your Branded Fusion! Branded Lost is a perfect way to bait a negate or to guarantee your Fusion effect when you're against these threats. </li><li class=""elementToProof"">In certain common meta match-ups, Dragoon is untouchable by your opponent. If you can, try to summon Dragoon before you use key cards like Branded Fusion to guarantee it's resolution. Also, if you want to play around Nibiru, summon Dragoon before 5 summons. Dragoon is also your go-to answer when facing down Kashtira Ariseheart's macro-cosmos like floodgate and targeting banish.</li><li class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a>Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</a></strong></li></ul></div><div class=""elementToProof""><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></p></div><div class=""elementToProof"">The culmination of the ""Abyss"" storyline also coincides with the strongest form that Branded has ever fielded. All the support for Branded over the last couple years creates a consistent, strong and resilient deck. Naturally playing through established boards while having a robust grind game is only something that few decks can boast. To see for youself how this deck performs vs. meta, I highly recommend you see the deck in action by watching the Youtube video linked below!</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">Our hero, Albaz has faced his enemies to ultimately triumph through trials and adversity. Now, you can do the same thing as you pilot Branded! <br /><br />GLHF Duelists!</div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

This can search with Triamid Cruiser when you otherwise cannot get it into the graveyard.
