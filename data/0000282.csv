This deck is interesting because you have a very large amount of Ancient Warriors cards available to use but you don't have the best play enablers that are used in a competitive version of the deck in the card game so you <strong>explore other cool aspects of the Ancient Warriors archetype to build plays</strong>.

//////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Explanation of the ""Ancient Warriors"" (""AW"") cards</strong>:

One way to fix most of the effects of ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters is to <strong>separate them by their Attributes</strong> because the Monsters that have the same Attribute share some effects that have the <strong>same activation condition or have the same objective</strong> as for example all WATER Monsters have an Ignition effect of adding an ""AW"" Card to the hand, what differs is whether it will add from the Deck or GY to the hand and whether it will be Monster or Spell/Trap. And they also <strong>have an Opponent Interaction effect</strong> that activates whenever you use another ""Ancient Warriors"" Monster's effect.

Basically the <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" WATER</strong> Monsters <strong>send Continuous Spell/Trap to the GY</strong> to add an ""Ancient Warriors"" Continuous Spell/Trap to the hand, with <a data-name=""Graceful Zhou Gong"">Graceful Zhou Gong</a> <strong>adding from the Deck</strong> and <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> <strong>adding from the GY</strong>. You can only use Eccentric Lu Jing's effect if you first have a legal target in the GY which means that among the Normal Summons of the deck it is the one that <strong>most needs you to have already made other plays</strong> before you can send a Continuous Spell/Trap that you control for the GY.
They have an <strong>interaction effect that activates when you use another ""AW"" Monster's effect</strong>, with <a data-name=""Graceful Zhou Gong"">Graceful Zhou Gong</a> being a <strong>Monster Negate</strong> until end of turn as an Infinite Impermanence and <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> a <strong>Spell/Trap Pop</strong> like a Mystical Space Typhoon.

<a data-name=""Deceptive Jia Wen"">Deceptive Jia Wen</a> is from the <strong>FIRE Attribute</strong> and has a simple Ignition effect on the field of <strong>sending a Continuous Spell/Trap to the GY</strong> and Halve ATK of two Monsters on the field which works for you to be able to play the <strong>Spells/Traps of ""Ancient Warriors"" to the GY and trigger their good effects</strong>. The second effect depends on an <strong>opponent's card being destroyed</strong> and allows you to add any ""Ancient Warriors"" Card from the GY to the hand.

<a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> is the last of the <strong>Level 4 ""Ancient Warriors"" available</strong> in the Format and has <strong>WIND Attribute</strong> and is the <strong>best extender avaliable</strong> because whenever added to the hand by the effect of an ""AW"" card you can Special Summon it to the field. And on the field he is an <strong>Omni Negate of Spell/Trap Activation by sending an ""Ancient Warriors"" Continuous Spell/Trap to the GY</strong>. He is also an Omni Negate from Monster Effect however you need to control ""Virtuous Liu Xuan"" which doesn't exist in Normal/Rare Format.

<a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a> is from <strong>FIRE Attribute</strong> and is basically a <strong>Battle Phase Hand Trap for ""Ancient Warriors"" monsters</strong> entering the field in the <strong>Damage Step taking 1000ATK from the opponent's monster and he will still destroy an opponent's card when he sees his a card being destroyed</strong>. An excellent card in this format for the ease of cleaning multiple opponent cards at once in addition to <strong>protecting your OTHERS ""Ancient Warriors"" from being destroyed by battle</strong>.

<a data-name=""Valiant Zhang De"">Valiant Zhang De</a> has <strong>WIND Attribute</strong> and is practically the <strong>Boss Monster from ""Ancient Warriors"" available in N/R Format</strong>. It is Special Summoned from the hand if you <strong>control 2 or more ""Ancient Warriors""</strong> and gains 300ATK for each opponent's monster during your turn and if your opponent controls more monsters than you it can make up to 2 Attacks in the Battle Phase.
<a data-name=""Loyal Guan Yun"">Loyal Guan Yun</a> is what we <strong>can call Normal/Rare Format Pseudo-</strong><a data-name=""Pankratops"">Pankratops</a> because it only enters the field by Special Summon from the hand if <strong>only the opponent controls Monsters and its interaction effect can only be used if your opponent controls more monsters than you</strong>. He, like the <a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a>, protects his OTHERS ""Ancient Warriors"" monsters, only in this case he <strong>protects them from card effect targets</strong>. It gets a lot worse if you're going first or draw it when you already have an established field but it's still possible to Special Summon it out of hand with <a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a>.

<a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a> is the <strong>ROTA of ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters in Normal/Rare format</strong>. All you have to do is <strong>Normal or Special any ""Ancient Warriors"" to trigger its effect</strong> and add an ""AW"" Monster with a different name from the Deck to the hand. <strong>This pairs well with the</strong> <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> that Special Summons. Also when it is <strong>sent from the s/t zone to the GY you can Special Summon an ""Ancient Warriors"" from your hand</strong> functioning as a Double Extender. It only stays on the field for <strong>2 Standby Phase after activation</strong> which means you always want to send it to the GY during the same turn of its activation so you don't lose card advantage and for that we have the <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Level Monsters 4 to perform this function</strong>.
<a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> has a simple field interaction effect similar to <a data-name=""Deceptive Jia Wen"">Deceptive Jia Wen</a>'s of cutting ATK in half. But its main effect is <strong>when sent to the GY and you must control 2 ""Ancient Warriors"" of DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES</strong> to activate it which is to <strong>put 1 ""AW"" Continuous Spell/Trap from Hand or Deck Face-Up on the Field</strong>. As you first need to have 2 ""AW"" of different Attributes on the field it needs you to establish a setup prior to its activation to work but the deck is competent in leaving this effect alive.
<a data-name=""East-by-South Winds"">East-by-South Winds</a> is the <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Continuous Spell</strong> which makes the deck competitive in N/R Format because <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters are cards that you will rarely use as an Extra Deck Monster material</strong> since the LINK-2 <a data-name=""Double Dragon Lords"">Double Dragon Lords</a> is not available and you need to maintain field presence to control the match. So it will be <a data-name=""East-by-South Winds"">East-by-South Winds</a> that will do the <strong>job of you being able to clear any threat from the opponent's field</strong> because it basically <strong>has no effect on the field and yes you just want to send it from the s/t zone to the GY</strong> and with that it will make your <strong>opponent unable to respond to the activation of the effects of your ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters</strong> and they even gain an additional effect during the Battle Phase whenever <strong>declaring an Attack will destroy an Opponent's card without targeting</strong>. With that you take control of the game and put the opponent in Time because on your next turn you will most likely have lethal damage on the table to win the duel.
The Trap <a data-name=""Defense of Changban"">Defense of Changban</a> <strong>protects your monsters from Spells/Traps during the opponent's Battle Phase</strong> until the end of the Damage Step so you avoid taking cards such as <a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a> which is very annoying in this format. It also works as a <a data-name=""Negate Attack"">Negate Attack</a> as the <strong>opponent will not be able to target your ""AW"" Monsters for Attacks</strong> and generally you will only have them as an attack target option. And <strong>in GY she can banish herself when the opponent declares an Attack to Special Summon an ""Ancient Warriors"" straight from the Deck</strong>. The only detail is that you can only use one of the effects per turn, but it's simple for you to make combos that can send the Defense of Changban to the GY on your turn to use the GY effect on the opponent's turn.

It is because of <strong>interaction effects</strong> like the ones presented above that <strong>""Ancient Warriors"" Cards gain a lot of value when you go second for being able to deal with the cards that the opponent has on the field via the engine</strong>. So it's always <strong>recommended to go second</strong> with this deck to get the most potential out of your cards, plus some of them <strong>have effects that are only useful if your opponent controls Monsters</strong> like <a data-name=""Loyal Guan Yun"">Loyal Guan Yun</a> <strong>or depends on you going to the Battle Phase</strong> to do something like Halve the opponent's monster's ATK with <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a>, enter by Special Summon and lower the opponent's monster's ATK by 1000 with <a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a>, be able to attack twice each Battle Phase with <a data-name=""Valiant Zhang De"">Valiant Zhang De</a>, or Prevent that the opponent activates Spell/Traps eff until the end of the Damage Step with the <a data-name=""Defense of Changban"">Defense of Changban</a> or the best of all available options which is <a data-name=""East-by-South Winds"">East-by-South Winds</a> which prevents the opponent from responding to their effects from ""AW"" monsters besides them destroy a card without targeting each time they declare an Attack.

//////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Comments</strong>:

One of the <strong>most common plays</strong> is using <a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a> <strong>to add</strong> <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> to the hand that will be Special Summoned.

<a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> can <strong>negate the activation of his own Spells/Traps that you activate on the field</strong> and that way you can even on turn 1 make great plays that wouldn't be possible involving other Archetype Monsters.
One of the best moves in the deck is using <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> to <strong>place the Trap</strong> <a data-name=""Defense of Chagban"">Defense of Chagban</a> Face-Up. And then you <strong>send the Trap to the GY</strong> with the <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> or <a data-name=""Graceful Zhou Gong"">Graceful Zhou Gong</a> so that it becomes a <strong>Special Summon from the Deck on the opponent's turn</strong> which is usually the ""Hand Trap"" <span class=""name_txt selectable""><a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a> </span>because it protects from destruction per battle.
An example of application of these cards is you <strong>activated</strong> <a data-name=""Three Visits"">Three Visits</a> and <strong>Normal Summoned</strong> <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> and added <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> <strong>to the hand</strong> that entered the field and then you activate <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> and with that <strong>you can negate its activation</strong> with the <a data-name=""Ingenious Zhuge Kong"">Ingenious Zhuge Kong</a> when <strong>sending the Three Visits to the GY</strong> and with that trigger the effect of <a data-name=""Borrowing of Arrows"">Borrowing of Arrows</a> to put the <a data-name=""Defense of Changban"">Defense of Changban</a> face-up on the field and then use the effect of the <a data-name=""Eccentric Lu Jing"">Eccentric Lu Jing</a> to <strong>send the Defense of Changban to the GY and add the Three Visits from Follow Up</strong> and leave the Trap in the GY to Special Summon an ""AW"" from the Deck on your opponent's turn when declaring an Attack on your monsters.

<a data-name=""Fearsome Zhang Yuan"">Fearsome Zhang Yuan</a>'s <strong>hand trap effect becomes a pop in the damage step if your monster destroys the opponent's</strong> and your opponent won't be able to chain set cards it has from not being in the Battle Step. In addition to its <strong>protection effect from the other ""AW"" Monsters against destruction by battle</strong> it makes its field presence very solid.

<a data-name=""Link Apple"">Link Apple</a> and <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> are on the decklist because you <strong>don't care about the Extra Deck</strong> so their usage doesn't conflict with the deck. <strong>Link Apple</strong> is basically an <a data-name=""Upstart Goblin"">Upstart Goblin</a> of the N/R format if you don't banish a LINK Monster with its effect in hand and I don't even use LINK Monsters in the Extra Deck to prevent it from activating the Special Summon effect instead of drawing cards. <strong>Punishment</strong> <strong>destroys any monster on the field</strong> no matter its ATK and if it is a monster with <strong>1700ATK or less you can send the</strong> <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Wagon"">Fossil Machine Skull Wagon</a> to the GY which is a <strong>Spell/Trap Pop</strong>. On the other hand, <a data-name=""Fog Blade"">Fog Blade</a> has very good applications in this deck since you won't always go second so it's a good interaction card to set going first and it's a <strong>Continuous Trap which has synergy with the Level 4 ""Ancient Warriors"" Monsters that can send it to the GY to activate its effects</strong>. Also in specific cases you can use the <a data-name=""Fog Blade"">Fog Blade</a> <strong>on your own monsters to prevent your opponent from targeting them for Attacks</strong> ensuring they survive the Battle Phase.

Tip:
-Summon 2 Live★Twin first, then Summon Huggin Search Spring, then Summon Ki-sikii and Draw 1.
-If you can't Summon Sunny, Summon Frost and Huggin Search Spring then Ki-sikii (or make sure you have Ki-sikii on the Field and Frost in the Grave). You often Draw 1 in Opponent's Turn.
-Active Point in Draw Phase to avoid Droll.
-If your opponent have more than 1 card on the field, don't Summon Ki-sikii on 5th Monster Zone, to Summon Unicorn Colink Ki-sikii Suffle 1 and Draw 1, then Summon Lil-la and Destroy 1. If they only have 1 card, don't Summon Lil-la on 1st Monster Zone (to Suffle 1 and Draw 2).
-Snitch is a very good Card to survive OTK but if Opponent can't, don't Active too soon.
-If Opponent have Raigeki/Storm/Duster, Tribute Sunny and Summon Huggin to protect your Field and Draw 1.
-Underworld is another boss beside Sunny and can be used to remove unaffected Monster.
Side deck:
-Go first: Remove Psy packet and some useless card then Side Judgment and some suitable card (usually Nibiru/Cosmic/Droll).

GIVE AWAY AT 1k SUBS ONLY 15 Away!

You heard it here folks, now let me just say this deck is not clickbait, its actually good. I also love that it is cheap. I went from P1-D3 with this deck with an 80% win rate. The deck is very fair and tempo oriented, Think of it like a control deck but without the floodgates. Instead you win by trading 1 for 1s with your opponent but since your cards also generate card advantage you win eventually gassing them out.

Best starter to open is Tincan as it tutors other Kozmo cards out of your deck."

A","This is an attempt at a pure P.U.N.K. list, using Jet Synchron and Halq to enable Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity. This deck has two main lines: opening one of the P.U.N.K. starters with an extender (Red Hared Hasty Horse, Gizmek Orochi, or Psychic Wheeleder), or opening a P.U.N.K. starter with no extender. I didn't include Ash Blossom, Nibiru, or Crossout Designator in this list to keep it semi-budget, but I will upload another list with a more optimized build using those cards.

&nbsp;

Our starters are Ze Amin, Sharakusai and another P.U.N.K. in hand, Emergency Teleport, Ogre Dance, or Foxy Tune. If we open Ze Amin, we search Foxy Tune after summoning, use Foxy Tune to summon Sharakusai, and continue with the combo listed below. If we open Emergency Teleport we can do the same thing, searching Ze Amin, or we can summon Sharakusai if we have a P.U.N.K. in hand. Ogre Dance searches either Ze Amin or Sharakusai, and Foxy Tune does the same. Make sure to use your Ogre Dance for a search before continuing the combo, as we will need a Dark in grave. Also, always use your Ze Amin search, grabbing Ogre Dance if we already have Foxy Tune.

Once we have Sharakusai and another P.U.N.K. in hand or on field, we want to use our extenders. First summon  Cupid Fore, then Psychic Wheeleder, if you have them. Activate Sharakusai to fusion summon Rising Carp using a monster in hand, or on field if you don't have a monster in hand. Activate Rising Carp to summon a Deer Note and a Madame Spider or Wa Gon from deck (preferably Madame Spider). If you only opened one extender, normal summon a P.U.N.K. from hand, then link off the extender and the P.U.N.K. for your Halqifibrax, using Halq to search Jet Synchron. Syncho summon Chaos Ruler using Deer Note and your other P.U.N.K. on field, activating Deer Note, then Chaos Ruler. Summon Sharakusai off of Deer Note and add a monster to hand off of Chaos Ruler (preferably a hand trap). Synch off Chaos Ruler and Jet Synchron for Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, then use Jet Synchron in grave to return it to the field, and use Chaos Ruler's effect to return it to the field, as well.  Now, on your opponent's turn, you should have at least one trap (searched off of Madame Spider), one hand trap (from Chaos Ruler, if we're lucky), Sharakusai's ability to synch into Amazing Dragon for a few bounces, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss's effect negation, and Halq into Formula Synchron into Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity to stop your opponent form activating cards and effects.

&nbsp;

Our line is much less exciting if we don't open any extenders. We still make Rising Carp off of Sharakusai, but instead of going for Halqifibrax and Chaos Ruler, we make Draco Berserker of the Tenyi, summoning back Sharakusai off of Deer Note. We are playing three Pot of Avarice to shuffle back our P.U.N.K.s; specifically Rising Carp, which we can use on following turns to make another Amazing Dragon or Psychic End Punisher. If we get Ash Blossomed, we can sometimes still extend a bit. Gossip Shadow is in the deck to allow for followup after getting Ashed on our Ze Amin/E-Tele/Foxy Tune as long as we have a Psychic Wheeleder and a Lv 3 P.U.N.K. in hand. If we know that the opponent is playing Nibiru, and we open Psychic Wheeleder and an Emergency Teleport or Foxy Tune, we can make Gossip Shadow before committing to our Draco Berserker line.

&nbsp;

With a Red Hared Hasty Horse, we can instead make Chaos Ruler or Draco Berserker, and with Gizmek Orochi we can make a level 11 instead. Satellite Warrior is in our extra deck so that if we get stuck on Halqifibrax with a level 8 on field or a Gizmek Orochi in grave, we can make Satellite Warrior off of our Formula Synchron summon. Unfortunately, without Crossout Designator we don't have much play through Nibiru. If you have any ideas on what would help this deck to survive a Nibiru, please comment down below.

&nbsp;

That's all I have for this deck, I hope you like it and please let me know if there are any changes you would make!"

Instead I will state my reasoning for some of my choices

Non Handtrap Cards

<strong>Jack Jaguar </strong>(2off) - <strong>Pot of Desires</strong>: In my opinion the ratio of your Jaguars is always based on Desires. Builds that don't use Desires can play only 1 Jaguar, but I have some kind of masochistic relationship with that card (it's complicated I can't explain) so I can't help but using it. Since we always want our copy of Jaguar when playing the deck I opted for the classic 2off to secure at least a copy in case I use Desires

<strong>Flame Bufferlo </strong>(instead of Lady Debug): I feel like I don't really need to explain this but I'll do it. With 3 Cynet Minings and 3 Salamangreat Circles I think there is no need for Debug. Bufferlo instead offers 2 new cards when linked away (providing we manage to use his effect) which in my opinion is of much importance since those 2 cards may be extends (Parallel Exceed for instance), handtraps or Called-by.

<strong>Accesscode Talker </strong>(2off): I know some of you are wondering about that choice. Well it's a way to ensure your final attack will surely pass through, meaning that it's just a consistency choice as it is with @Ignisters. That's also the reason I decided to play 1 Heatleo instead of the classic 2.

<strong>Dark Ruler No More </strong>(3off - Side Deck): Drnm, as this card's name is abbreviated is arguably one of the best (if not the best) going 2nd cards in the game for this format. People could say that Droplet has a bigger impact. That's not wrong but please let me explain even if you think it is wrong. So Salamangreat being mostly a control deck prefers to have cards to use for control (traps, handtraps, etc.). So with using Droplet you may have to give up on such cards. On the other hand Drnm does not cut down your hand size and is a budget card nowadays thanks to it's most recent reprint. My reasoning may be wrong in this choice, so if you have some other idea please do explain in the comments (by using arguments not like some screaming chimpanzees).

<strong>Rivarly of the Warlords </strong>(3off - Side Deck): Another card that allows controlling the game. If we exclude Bagooska all your monsters that can exist on our field are Cyberse so we are not largely affected. To be honest the debate here lies within the dilemma of using Rivarly or Gozen Match. My reasoning of using the former is the fact that it can shutdown engines like Brave, P.U.N.K or Therion when used in decks of not the same type which is usually the case.

Handtraps

Any proper player should know that the handtraps used in a deck are chosen based in the decks you will face in the tournament you are going to participate or your friends' decks if you play more casually. Nevertheless there are handtraps like Ash Blossom and Effect Veiler who have a big impact on both combo and control decks. So I will refrain from explaining why I am using these 2 and instead explain my reasons for the other hts included

<strong>D.D.</strong> <strong>Crow</strong>: This particular handtrap is a good budget option for most recent formats. Nowadays with the Scythe lock still being around and it's ability to banish any card from the opponent's GY I'm pretty sure it can bring headaches to players that like their GY

<strong>Nibiru </strong>(Side Deck): Nibiru is a high impact handtrap that can make most opponents cry. The reason why I felt like I have to explain this choice of mine is the fact that in this deck is used as a control going 2nd option against combo decks which always are on high spirits.

<strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird </strong>(Side Deck): Okay I now people will ask why to use this handtrap in a format when no Dragon Link exists. Yeah I know you guys are right and Ghost Ogre or Ghost Belle can be better choices. But, what makes me want to use Droll is the return of Monkeyboard and of course the return of the 2nd copy of Benten."

Practically the goal is to bring out your two boss monsters, <strong>Dinomorphia Kentregina </strong>and <strong>Dinomorphia Resturm</strong>, as soon as possible. An easy way to do this is the following:
<ol>
 	<li>Normal summon <strong>Dinomorphia Therizia</strong></li>
 	<li>Activate Therizia's effect and set from the deck to the field the trap card <strong>Dinomorphia Frenzy</strong></li>
 	<li>During your opponent's Main Phase you activate Dinomorphia Frenzy to fusion summon <strong>Dinomorphia Kentregina </strong>(I usually send as materials Dinomorphia Stealthbegia from the Extra Deck and Dinomorphia Diplos from my Main Deck)</li>
 	<li>Activate Kentregina's effect to banish Frenzy from the GY and replicate it's effect. The target of this fusion summon is your <strong>Dinomorphia Rexsturm</strong></li>
</ol>
At this point of the game you have halved your LP twice meaning that thanks to Rexsturm's effect your opponent's monsters with an ATK value of 2000 or more points cannot activate their effects. However it's almost a given that you will be given the chance to lower your LP even more, making Rexsturm even more deadly.

Overally a pretty intersting deck with a unique type of gameplay, that in my opinion should see more play competitevely (if this already happens please forgive me)."

Built to go first and disrupt, prone to bricks.","It's nothing complex, no combos.

Just try to survive and you get a win eventually. The ideal hand would have a level 4 and ties but honestly, anything goes, it's fundamentally a lair of darkness deck with labrynths just supporting in hopes of a first turn virus attack and to help recovery.

... You just have to go first and not brick on all s/t or no s/t. Fair enough, no?

Alternatively, an attempt can be made to add droplets or dark ruler to have a chance going second vs meta.

Today i wanted to rock with symphonycs but was surprised by the synergy it has with this kind of zefra variation. The greatest synergy is with <a data-name=""Guitariss"">Guitariss, he is a level 3 tuner has a scale of 0 and even can bounce your own scales. pretty nice. </a>

The D/D engine is searchable with your standard Crocodragon-Oracle combo and it possibilities easy acess to halq and, thus, scythe lock.

&nbsp;

In a good hand you can make Apollousa 4 negates + scythe lock (baronne included) + Zefra omni negate. Still, i need to test more and see what cards i can cut from the extra deck, because there's some situations were you can make the croco-oracle search become recharger-oracle or idk, maybe masquerena is good for winmore?

&nbsp;

So in the end i stand here just saying how much it was cool to try warping around the engines. XD

Spells and Trap heavy deck that all orient around chance that rely on delaying your opponent and chip away their LP towards victory.

The game starts as soon as the first coin flip happens to give you the moral and the better chance to win <strong>Gambler </strong>is in your starting hand to refresh your hand after your first move. <strong>Second Dice Roll</strong> is a must have to increase your chance to get the results you want and to avoid the negative repercussions of getting the wrong call, especially with <strong>Gambler. </strong>Its high risk, high reward at the beginning of the duel.

Consider your monster cards as your opponent's dealer. <strong>Ms. Judge </strong>and <strong>Dice Jar</strong> forces your opponent to test their own luck. If their luck is as shitty as yours, you can cripple your opponent's monster field to keep yourself alive. <strong>The Paths of Destiny </strong>and <strong>Head Judging </strong>also makes your opponent to test their luck and to deal good damage if luck is on your side.

<strong>Tour of Doom,</strong> <strong>Fairy Box, </strong>and <strong>Roulette Spider</strong> should be considered as your last line of defense.

Having <strong>That Six</strong> should only be used to rig the result of <strong>Dice Jar</strong>'s outcome and use the maximum potential of it's effect. By changing your dice result to a 6, you deal <em>6000LP </em>without relying on luck.

<em>There are a few things to consider while using this deck that the cards don't make clear;
</em><strong>- Second Coin Toss </strong>only works once, and only once. It can't be used on multiple cards that has a coin flip effect.
<strong>- </strong>Against decks that can kill spells and traps or cards like Harpies' Feather Duster or Lightning Storm is this deck's weakness since there's no defense against them.
<strong>-</strong> Activating<strong> Second Coin Toss </strong>after activating <strong>The Paths of Destiny </strong>also give your opponent the chance for another coin toss.
<strong>- </strong>Use <strong>Dicephoon </strong>before placing down any cards if by the off chance that your roll a 5 and must destroy one of your spell/trap card after destroying your opponent's.

<span><span>If going first,</span> your objective is to set the classic generic Zombie combo: <span>get both <a data-name=""Zombie World"">Zombie World</a> and <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a></span> on the field, summon <a data-name=""Glow-Up Bloom"">Glow-Up Bloom</a> with Halq's effect, link Bloom off and use it's graveyard effect to summon <a data-name=""Doomking Balerdroch"">Doomking Balerdroch</a> since you control Zombie World, then link your link 1 and Doomking off into <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>, so <span>in your opponent's turn you will get a draw</span> from Sucker when Doomking comes back, plus once you used <span>Doomking's effects</span> you can use Halq to go into <a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a> to <span>draw another card</span> and then use both Formula and Doomking to <span>synchro summon <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a></span>.</span><span> The nice thing about the Skull Servants is that they also have use turn 1 as <span>extenders</span> for your combo (Both <a data-name=""Wightprince"">Wightprince</a> and <a data-name=""Wightmare"">Wightmare</a></span><span> can summon bodies on to the field) while helping you clean things up in turn 3 with a </span><a data-name=""King of the Skull Servants"">King of the Skull Servants</a><span> that is easily <span>5000+ ATK</span> in most cases.</span>

<span>If going second, the utility of the Skull Servants doesn't really need an explanation, they are one of the more <span>iconic go second decks in the game</span>, all they really need is to get <a data-name=""Wightbaking"">Wightbaking</a> into the grave to get things started and this deck has many ways to do so. The deck also runs <span><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a></span> which are not only great for breaking boards going second and discarding the cards you want in grave but can also be set if going first.</span>

However, people have tried to make them work by using the glue archetype for the Beast Tri-Type, Tri-Brigade, which improves the deck drastically, but still doesn't make the deck viable by any means. Great if you want to troll or have fun though.

It is still OTK focused with some things to do going first.

The cards:
<ul>
 	<li>Jizukiru: A searchable Kaiju that you can fuse away for Fortress Dragon.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Dragon: The original. Easy monster on the field going second, the target for Machine Duplication, can out stuff like Apollousa/Mechabe via the Chimeratechs.</li>
 	<li>Galaxy Soldier: A machine Lv5 for Nova and a LIGHT Lv5 for Pleiaden. With him and a Herz on hand you get a full Nova with a Cyber Dragon in GY to revive (Soldier send Herz to special &gt; CL1 Soldier add another Soldier, CL2 Herz add a CyDra &gt; Send CyDra to special the second Soldier &gt; Overlay into Nova/Pleiaden). Only at 2 because you can only search OPT with it so the 3rd one tends to be dead. Searchable with Cyber Repair Plant.</li>
 	<li>Cyberdark Chimera: Part of the Cyberdark Engine. Searched via Cyberdark Realm, you can send a Spell from Hand to GY to search Power Bond and you can also fuse from GY for that summon. Very easy OTK, but pretty disruptable.</li>
 	<li>Cyberdark Claw: You can discard it to search for either Cybernetic Horizon or Cyberdark Realm. It is also a material for Cybernetic Horizon to send to grave. Only 2 because you don't need a 3rd.</li>
 	<li>Maxx ""C"": Master Duel Tax. I wish it were banned.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Dragon Core: Searches every Spell/Trap, starts your combos, is a CyDra in GY and on Field, can be searched by Emergency and Repair Plant, is a target for Machine Duplication and can be banished from GY to special a CyDra-Monster from Deck when you have no monsters. Very susceptible to Ash/Imperm.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Dragon Nächster: Great extender and good for recovery. You can send a CyDra to GY to immediatley revive it. You can also revive Nova/Infinity or Rampage Dragon. Very searchable and can be specialed by Core for recovery. Is a target for Machine duplication.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Dragon Herz: Searches a CyDra from Deck or GY(which includes Nächster/Core due to their effects) when it is sent to GY (either by Contactfusing it, as material for Soldier/Nächster/Droplet). Can also become a Lv5 when specialed. A Machine Duplication target.</li>
 	<li>Cyberdark Realm: Searches Chimera (or Claw if need be) and gives you a free Normal Summon. Can be searched by either Claw or Core.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Emergency: Searches every CyDra and can be recovered if the activation(!) is negated. Searchable with Core.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Repair Plant: Searches a LIGHT Machine when you have at least 1 CyDra in GY. Is used for Soldier and Jizukiru and can be searched by Core.</li>
 	<li>Cybernetic Horizon: An insane searcher. Gives you either part of the Cyberdarks/CyDras (whatever you need), can activate Herz and sends a Cyber-Fusion to GY, which is also important for the OTKs. Only at 2 because it can be dead quickly and is searchable with either Claw or Core.</li>
 	<li>Machine Duplication. Gives you 2 CyDras on the Field when you have Core/Nächster/Herz. So you get a very easy Nova -&gt; Infinity with it. It's not OPT(!).</li>
 	<li>Overload Fusion: Great Recovery, can be used to extend into Rampage after a combo.</li>
 	<li>Power Bond: Enables insane OTKs. Can be searched and 'powered up' with Chimera.</li>
 	<li>Called by the grave: To stop Ash/Maxx ""C""/DPE/etc.</li>
 	<li>Cyberload Fusion: Can be searched with Core, works great together with Chimera/Overload. It's a quick-play, so you can use it in the Battle Phase for  e.g. Twin Dragon to push for game.</li>
 	<li>Forbidden Droplet: A must-have going second. Also triggers Herz.</li>
 	<li>Cybernetic Overflow: Great disruption when you have to go first. Searchable with Core</li>
 	<li>Infinite Impermanence: A great trap, works from your hand when your field is empty, but is not dead when you have to go first.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Eternity Dragon: Your primary target for Cybernetic Horizon. It protects your OTK by banishing it from GY. Can also be used as a wall in a pinch.</li>
 	<li>Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon: Removes monsters from the Extra Monster Zone, great to remove Arrival-Cyberse/Apollousa</li>
 	<li>Invoked Mechaba: You can summon it with Nova when your opponent Nibirus you.</li>
 	<li>Chimeratech Overdragon: As a comeback option with Overload Fusion.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Twin Dragon: Mostly summoned with Cyberload Fusion during the Battle Phase to push for game.</li>
 	<li>Chimeratech Fortress Dragon: To remove hard to remove machines like Superdora.</li>
 	<li>Chimeratech Rampage Dragon: Your primary OTK-enabler. Destroys enemy backrow and can attack up to 3 times by milling 2 monbsters from deck. Thats 12600 Damage with Power Bond.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Dragon Infinity: An omni-negate for going first or to protect your OTK. Can also be used to suck up annoying enemy monsters.</li>
 	<li>Constellar Pleiaden: As another disruption when you go first.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Dragon Nova: Bridges into Infinity, revives a CyDra and can push for OTKs. Also punishes your opponent for sending it to the GY.</li>
 	<li>Cyber Dragon Sieger: Boosts your OTK-enablers like Rampage or Twin.</li>
 	<li>Salamangreat Almiraj: To link of Core to make Repair Plant live.</li>

I’m here with another master duel list, this one is for mekk-knights!

Normally Blue Sky would be at two but Girsu is a limited card in master duel and so I rolled with three to be better at searching.

This particular list aims to go second, it’s entire idea is to otk with big bodies because that’s what mekk-knights are but if it can’t do that it’s other job is to use Key, Whispers, and Secret to preform a lockdown.

People in master duel don’t play around mekk-knights.

Mekk-Knights have four animated monsters!

Purple Nightfall as the leader of the Mekk-Knights and the strongest one stats-wise while they are separated (nightfall also is probably the best one, period).

Blue Sky is a monster who serves importance in the storyline choosing a successor and other things, he’s also a pretty solid card too who can provide three searches.

Spectrum Supreme, the monster who basically is when all of the Mekk-Knights combine into one.

And Avramax, who is just a Mekk-Knight for lore reasons.

Overall, very fun! Would recommend if you want to see how bad players are at reading!"

When bad hand, next game use KaLi YuGa to win the gam","I use this deck and got the top5 on the 43 people weekly tournament last month.

The goal of this deck is to make the 3 Ultimate Falcon boards. (require 2 rank up magic in hand). 1 rank-up magic can make 1 to 2 Ultimate Falcon for final boards. 0 rank up can make 0 to 2 Ultimate Falcon for final boards.

The final board has 3 Ultimate falcons which all are unaffected by other card's effect, 1 to 2 booster Strix on hand to protect the Ultimate Falcon destroyed by battle, or 1 booster Strix and raidraptor-readiness to avoid all the damage in turn 2.

To make the ultimate falcon, there are 3 +1 ways. First is to make the rank 7, and use it and another raidraptor to link wise strix, when rank 7 send to the grave, it can special summon 1 ultimate falcon from the extra deck. The second is to use last strix or cattle to make the rank 8 satellite cannon falcon, then use astral rank up or skip force to make the ultimate falcon. Third is to use the phantom knights' rank-up-magic force to make the ultimate falcon.  1 way that is not common to use is when rank 5 destroyed and sent to grave, bringing back the ultimate falcon from the grave.

To make the rank 7 Arsenal Falcon(Key Card for this deck), there are 2 + 2 ways. First way is use any 2 level 4 raidraptor to make raider's knight, then use effect to make rank5 stranger falcon, then use astral rank up or skip force make rank 7. Second way is use cattle or last strix make rank 6, then use raid force or phantom knights' rank up magic launch to make rank 7. Another 2 uncommon wat to make rank 7, one is to use cattle or last strix to make rank5, the use astral or skip rank up to make rank7, one is to use phantom knight's rank up magic force to make rank7(this will block wise strix for the rest of the turn), those siuation usually happen when start with not good hand, or be blocked some step by handtrap.

To make rank 4 force strix, just remember the basic all level 4 raidraptor effect, how to extend basic on the hand, usually start with vanish vanishing Lanius or tribute Lanius or last strix. Then speical strangle lanius or fuzzy lanius or pain lanius to make rank 4 or link 2.

(Remainder* Strangle lanius has limit for the Dark monter for the rest of the turn, Fuzzy lanius has limit for the ""Raidraptor"" monster for the rest of the turn, Pain lanius use for xyz only can use for wing beast xyz monster, raider's wing used effect to speical summon will banish when it leaves the field.)

To win the game in turn 3, firstly keep at least 1 Ultimate Falcon with xyz material(it can detach 1 material to block opponent all card effect for the rest of the turn), then use Rank-Up-Magic Skip Force in the grave, banish it, and 1 raidraptor monster in the grave, reborn 1 raidraptor xyz monter from the grave.(usually keep 1 of your opponent monster attack at least 2500, then reborn rank 5 stranger falcon, suicide attack that monster, when stranger falcon destroyed by battle or effect and send to the grave, it can reborn 1 raidraptor monster from the grave, then bring back the rank 7 on the grave, and suicide attack that monster, then rank 7 destroyed and send to the grave, use rank 7 effect to bring the rank 12 final fortress falcon from the extra deck, use rank 12 to attack, when rank 12 attack destroys the opponent monster, it can banish the raidraptor xyz monter from the grave and attack again, this effect can use at most twice which means at most 3-time attack with 3800 attacks. )

Another way of this deck is to use 2 heel eagle change 2 fuzzy Lanius to avoid ""Raidraptor"" monster limit, then make Phantom knight Rusty search rank up magic launch, and use gagagaga magician reborn the rank 7 on the grave, then make KaLi YuGa in opponent's turn.

<strong>Common Handtrap Part</strong>

Ash: only force Strix or the mimicry Lanius or fuzzy Lanius will be affected by ash, for the effect, special summon from the deck by wise Strix, it can use a self chain to avoid ash, witch is chain 1 wise Strix, chain 2 fuzzy Lanius or Arsenal Falcon effect in the grave.

Infinite or Effect veiler: depends on which step when your opponent uses. Usually use some not the most important effect first, then see if they use any of these effects.

Nibiru:  The biggest challenge for this deck, has two ways to avoid, one is to make the Arsenal Falcon in 5 steps (require rank up magic in hand), and another one is to make the ultimate Falcon first(also require rank up magic in hand), then detach material to avoid all the card effect until the end of your turn.

Psy Gamma and Ghost Orge: Also depends on which step they use, but they always use for first effect or wise Strix effect, then check the hand if there are more monster special summons.

Ghose Belle: only works on the Arsenal Falcon, if this is not use the rank up from the wise Strix search, make the second one by wise Strix to get the second rank up magic.

...And there are more and more handtrap for the game, if you can not over, just start a new game! My deck is not perfect, but the meaning of the monster is uneffected by any card effect is really good for the environment now, just avoid the kaiju and the monster can increase attack! Hope this is helpful to you."

It is capable of breaking boards quite easily in-engine going second, but is also able to put up incredible interruptions going first, and has decent grind game. I'd call it a combo deck, but a very midrangey combo deck, and I like to play towards that grind game. This list incorporates a small PUNK package, DPE, Halq+Auroradon shenanigans, and a pile of Wyrm and goodstuff synchro monsters.

So, for Punk monsters, I'm on a package of 7 cards. The idea behind this package is pretty simple - it enables Halq-Auroradon starts, or Verte follow-ups. The way it works is you NS Ze Amin, search Foxy Tune, discard Foxy Tune and pitch a card to special Madame Spider. Madame Spider searches the Trap, which is basically Imperm for most intents and purposes, then you go into Halq. The combo has 2 main routes - you either Summon Yazi and pop him to summon out a Swordsoul level 4, usually with the intention of making 2 8s or an 8 and a 10, or you make Baroness right away with Deskbot and the tokens, and then NS a Swordsoul monster to continue your combo from there. The real appeal to this package is Emergency Teleport - this allows you to make Halq (or occasionally Verte) without using your NS, and while it does require pitching a card, it replaces it with an interruption. 2 E-Tele is mandatory if you run this package - this is the best PUNK card. 2 Ze Amin are run just because of E-Tele - When you see E-Tele + Ze Amin you can summon another from your deck and pitch the one in your hand for free consistency and starts without a normal. Otherwise you'd run 2 Foxy Tune, which does still require your NS to do full combo, but also works as a sort of extender when you see your PUNK cards. The Spider and Dangerous Gabu are optional - you could run a third Ze Amin for more consistent starts, or you could replace the ""bricks"" in the main deck with 1 in the extra deck with the Fusion monster and run the Sharakusai instead of Spider, which will help you start more often. I don't have space in this version for Sharakusai in the extra deck, and I don't think Spider, a card that just plusses you by finding an interruption is that hard a brick - the trap with no real activation requirement beyond a monster being on your opponent's field is definitely not. This option mitigates the cost of discarding a card, and even helps you with consistency. Just don't be afraid to pitch the Spider instead of Normal Summoning it if that will make your end board bigger - the goal isn't to always search Gabu, Gabu is a nice bonus you'll find more often than not. However, if you don't like DPE you could consider Ogre Dance or Sharakusai in the package.

DPE bricks are here. You'll see Fusion Destiny often enough, and this whole package all together is insane, much more than the sum of its parts. DPE here can trigger Chengying, help recurr Ecclesia, the Draw 2 is actually very much appreciated. It also just does usual DPE things, being a good backup plan. I should note that you won't be adding DPE to your boards very often, and should consider the setups for it that you have available. For example, Chixiao could link with a Tenyi monster (not the link) into Verte, and while you'd just be ""exchanging"" an interruption, having the Draw 2 on the table is really sweet. Likewise, Omega is potentially great material for DPE. Interestingly, you can happily pitch a Destiny HERO monster to the PUNK engine in this deck, and just recover the HERO with Omega later, especially since you aren't reliant on DPE. Having said that, this is IMO the perfect DPE shell (at least, while Verte is legal - after that probably just Fusion decks I think).

I'm on Tenyis. 2 Adhara, 2 Vishuda. Used together, they can make Halq and go into the Auroradon lines. If you SS Vishuda and NS Adhara you can immediately make a Baxia to spin 2 cards. Also, both of the GY effects are super relevant. I'm keeping these packages small: Vishuda is great going second as a board breaking tool and Adhara enables combos and seriously helps with the grind, and they actually also enable Halq, DPE, and Baxia, so these are good. Nonetheless, I don't want too many Tenyi monsters clogging my hand.

1 Deskbot, because it SS itself from the GY for Auroradon lines. If you're looking for a bigger combo, a single O-Lion or Coltwing would enable a lot without changing the list very much - if you work at it, big Denglong combos are possible, but IMO they involve too many bricks and are just ""win more"". Either they stopped you before that, they have Droplets, or you're probably winning anyway. You could also run a single Jet Synchron with a link monster to go into, which would allow you to do Auroradon combos using either Jet or Deskbot to make Halq, and Jet will be a 1 card Halq (more interesting if you aren't already on 3/4 PUNK NS).

Swordsoul Emergence looks like just another ROTA, but oddly enough it is one of the deck's main 1 card starters, and by itself it can make an 8, or a Yazi going second. Also, strangely, the usual benefits of running Rotas to pull combos together aren't really here, or at least not to the same degree. Still, this card is very good, and I'm glad I found space for all 3. Sacred Summit is fine as a 1 of - sometimes it can revive a Swordsoul Synchro monster, sometimes even turn 1 after linking it off, but its main purpose is activating both Swordsoul level 4 effects in the same turn, and it is important to your main combo lines. Taia is fine as a 1 of - you search it out or summon it from the deck, but don't want to see it very much otherwise, and you can recycle 1 copy because Omega should be banned. I'm on 2 of the rest - Ecclesia basically stands in for either level 4 Swordsoul, and can SS itself going second, and recycles itself off of DPE doing DPE things, Mo-Ye is just better Taia a lot of the time, making easy 8s and drawing a card (in a way that chain blocks the 8). We're only on 2 Mo-Ye because you need 2 copies in rotation for follow-ups to be smooth, you kinda don't want to see it that much - however, it is fine to NS, and just play Swordsoul like Konami and God intended. We're on 2 Longyuan because I think you do want to see this card a fair bit, this is the easy 10 added to a lot of boards, sometimes it helps make Baroness before you start your combo which is impressive, the burn is medium but has actually mattered in a fair few matches, and while you want to search it out you would rather search out Sacred Summit or the Blackout if you could.

So, Ash, Maxx ""C"", and Called By the Grave are pretty standard, but we're not on a lot of hand traps after that. Why? Well, Swordsoul abilities are great at breaking boards, and cards like Fusion Destiny really help create pressure as well. Vishuda also ends up being Imperm or better in a lot of situations (often much better). The lone Ghost Ogre makes the cut because we're low on E-Tele targets, and also this way E-Tele represents an interruption at best, and an information hazard at worst (when often, drawn late into the combo, it would be dead otherwise). If Vishuda is one half of Imperm, Gabu is the other half - it is here because it is searchable, nobody is running this over Lost Wind, let alone Imperm, but the card is good. We're on 2 Blackout - I really like this card, but here it is also our only backrow hate. I like relying on traps to answer backrow anyways - gets around IO and Secret Village. I feel like Solemn Judgment is really good here - you're often trying to create scenarios where you can protect Chengying in multiple ways while having a way or two to trigger him. Solemn is just a good solid negation effect that handles a lot of the board breaking cards that can help against us (including most hands with Droplets against generic decks).

So, Extra deck, real quick -

1 Monk of the Tenyi. I'd love a second of these, don't burn your Monk up if you don't have to. Remember you can turn your Tenyi's on with Swordsoul tokens, and only make Monk when you have to. Still, space is too tight for 2, and you absolutely need 1.

1 Verte with 1 DPE. You won't make Verte a lot, you're usually hard drawing the Fusion Destiny, but you'll get stopped and make DPE on occasion, and you should run it while it is legal. It also opens up new routes to different high-end boards (if you use your thinker).

1 Needlefibre, 1 Auroradon. These 2, always causing trouble. This combo is stupid, and tuner + any other monster is 5 zones filled and another effect on top of it? I still say Halq needs to be banned - Auroradon might be a problem without it, but I'd be inclined to let it operate alone, because whenever this card is a problem it is with Halq.

Yazi is insane going second, and part of the main Halq line, so this one is mandatory. It is easier to make than you'd think.

2 Baxia. This card is good removal, another tool to trigger Chengying, and a wild combo enabler in some very strange lines. You can also use 1 Rota to make Yazi, use Yazi to pop a card and Yazi, Yazi effect to summon another Swordsoul and make Baxia, remove another card (s if you used Taia), and you still have Baxia's other effect. I would run 2 - this card very occasionally comes up going first and is a crucial tool on every later turn.

Omega and Savage are a package deal. Omega does literally everything but ever affect the field - that's not technically true, it occasionally beats over a monster. But the card A) attacks the hand, B) can provide information, C) recycles banished cards into the graveyard (including face-down ones?), D) recycles cards in the GY back into your deck and E) because of a quirk of THAT effect can also function as GY hate? Oh yeah, and there's no HOPT on there. Anywhere. Why is this card legal? Savage is also extremely good, and unless you have something specific to recover you should be making Savage when Halq is in the bin, especially since that's a play that protects a potential Chengying.

2 Chixiao are in the extra deck. This card immediately plusses you on summon, and then is a half-decent on-field negate after that. You need 2 because you're making this card right away and need a second for follow-up. If you ever need more, you can use Omega, although Omega can only recurr so much.

1 Baroness de Fleur. Omni-negates are good. Popping cards is good, although popping your own cards doesn't come up in this build as much as I expected. The tag-out is also wild in this deck - for example, it revives a DPE that has been Kaijued, as well as potentially Yazi and/or Baxia with are both insane targets too in their own right. It also lets you repeatedly set up the negate.

I'm on 2 Chengying, because I love this card. The rule for this card is simple - you need at least 1 way to trigger him, 1 way to protect him (not Chixiao, we're talking Solemn, Baroness, or Savage)... and then at least 1 extra. In other words, if Chixiao is the only way to trigger him, but I also have Savage and Solemn, I make Chengying - if it's Blackout and Chixiao but no negate, I make Baroness. This card is nuts, it's almost a floodgate against a lot of decks, it is a crazy powerful interruption if you use your brain, and the card also beats over everything and is a decent wall in Defense Mode too... oh yeah, and also it has generic protection too, for reasons that are good. the card does a lot. However, don't play into Nibiru, it really isn't worth it. Oddly, Baroness is sometimes just flat-out worse than Chengying, so even though I've stressed this play pattern, I also want to point out, when you have a secure Chengying, freaking make Chengying, because at that point you're narrowing down the lines of counterplay even further.

Still perpetually tuning - changed the P.U.N.K. package around to try and reduce some of the frequency of those bricky hands. While they were very soft bricks, I just don't think a deck that runs Deskbot as a true Takatomborg, as well as Destiny Hero monsters for Fusion Destiny, can afford the Gabu package, even though it was typically pretty good at mitigating the disadvantage from Foxy Tune.

Forever tuning. After a brief foray into the Rose Dragon package, I ultimately decided to stick to just PUNK, Tenyi, Swordsoul, Halq, and DPE (that's enough pile IMO). I just needed some of those generic staples back into the main, and so this version is tuned to do a little better going second. It bricks slightly more often, but also has play way more often, so I prefer this version."

They have cards like Commandant, which searches for Necrovalley(basically giving you 4x Terraforming), and Heretic, which is unaffected by all other card effects(which includes the ATK Boost from Necrovalley). This archetype doesn't really use the Extra Deck either, allowing them to work very well with the Dogmatika archetype, which prevent you summoning from your Extra Deck, as well as counter your Opponent's monsters summoned from the Extra Deck. As the dominant force in the OCG right now, Splight, makes heavy use of the GY, and rather than using a garbage deck like Exosister,  you can use a less garbage deck like this.

&nbsp;

<strong>1.</strong> The basic combo you want to be doing with this deck is summoning <a data-name=""cyber dragon core"">cyber dragon core</a> to grab 1 of our cyberdark spells.

<strong>2.</strong> Then you want to use <a data-name=""Cybernetic Horizon"">Cybernetic Horizon</a> to pitch a cyberdark card a cyberdragon card (sometimes herz usually core) pitch <a data-name=""Cyber End Dragon"">Cyber End Dragon</a> from extra deck and to pick up <a data-name=""CyberDark Cannon"">CyberDark Cannon</a> or <a data-name=""CyberDark Claw"">CyberDark Claw</a>.

<strong>3.</strong> Then use claw to grab <a data-name=""Cyberdark realm"">Cyberdark realm</a>, which you will then use cyberdark realm to grab cyberdark cannon.

<strong>4.</strong> Then you will pitch cannon to grab <a data-name=""Cyberdark Chimera"">Cyberdark Chimera</a>.

<strong>5.</strong> then use Cyberdark realm to normal summon chimera. Use chimera effect to grab <a data-name=""Power Bond"">Power Bond</a>.

<strong>6.</strong> Then you will link away core and chimera to make <a data-name=""Union carrier"">Union carrier</a>, this will trigger chimera effect which you will send edge keel or horn to the grave.

<strong>7.</strong> finally you will power bond going into <a data-name=""Cyberdarkness dragon"">Cyberdarkness dragon</a>, using its affect to attach cyber end dragon. Then you will fusion into <a data-name=""CyberDark End Dragon"">CyberDark End Dragon</a>.

<strong>8.</strong> Use <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a> to attach <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</a> to <a data-name=""Cyberdark end dragon"">Cyberdark end dragon</a> and then use Cyberdark end dragon to grab any card from Gy.

&nbsp;

The only out to this board is kaiju. Second less common way would be destroying backrow and going into <a data-name=""Accesscode talker"">Accesscode talker</a> which will have enough attack to go over your fusion."

For Link Evolution players, I'm running a new mod with Requiem created by BritishPiper that added 500 new cards. The mod works on the original, cracked or modded version of the game. The mod adds cards like Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Accesscode Talker, Eldlich, Adamancipator, Plunder Patrol and more. Check the Description of this video on Youtube for more info.

In the current meta, add Beyond the Pendulum (TCG Initial Release: 2022-05-19) &amp; Baronne de Fleur in place of Ascension Sky Dragon &amp; Evilswarm Nightmare.

Beyond the Pendulum makes this deck more consistent by adding Harmonizing Magician to hand. Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser &amp; Chronograph Sorcerer are great extenders when you're Performapal Skullcrobat Joker gets ashed or veilered, so you can go into Beyond the Pendulum. With Beyond the Pendulum on the field, you get 2 arrows to summon under when you pendulum summon.

The Combo:
Starting with isolde (which adds gearfried) plus a tuner (specifically arboria or oliver, making sure you dont use durendal):
1- Activate isolde, sending phoenix blade and fleuret de fleur to summon doppelwarrior
2- Summon halq with the tuner and isolde, summoning jet synchron
3- Summon martial metal marcher, activating its trigger effect to revive jet along with the 2 tokens
4- Summon celestial double star shaman with jet and a token, reviving doppel
5- Summon cupid pitch with the double star and doppel, using its effect to increase its level
6- Summon power tool with cupid pitch and a token, using cupid pitch to grab catche eve l2 and power tool to grab durendal
7- Summon garden rose maiden, grabbing black garden
8- Activate catche eve l2 to reduce the level of the rose maiden and summon it
9- Activate black garden and then summon roland with the rose maiden and catche eve l2, summoning a token to the opposite field
10- Activate black gardens effect to pop itself and the token to revive doppelwarrior, then use durendal to get renaud
11- Special renaud as a tuner and use its effect to add fleuret de fleur back to your hand
12- Summon the 2nd power tool with roland and the doppelwarrior, adding ddr
13- Summon stellar wind wolfrayet with one power tool, renaud, and a token
14- Activate phoenix blade, banishing whatever doesnt matter, then use jet synchron to discard it and summon itself
15- Summon chaos ruler with the other power tool and jet, you can activate its effect if you want but it kinda does nothing
16- Activate phoenix blade banishing some used up stuff again, then discard it with ddr to bring back the jet synchron again
17- Summon charles with the chaos ruler and the jet synchron
18- Activate rose maiden in grave to revive the chaos ruler
19- Activate fleuret de fleur on the double star shaman, then summon baronne with it and the chaos ruler
20- Activate chaos ruler's effect in grave to summon it
21- In end step activate charles, equipping phoenix blade from grave to equip ogier or oliver from deck, then pop the phoenix blade, and then add the therion with roland
22- your opponent ash/veiler/impermed your isolde, or activated nib before your halq even came out, so none of that happened anyway"

Morphtronics,"Use Halq to summon Scopen from the deck (treated as level 4 in def) and tune it with a Celfon for Hyper Librarian. Now each time you summon a Formula Synchron using a Celfon and a Smartfon/Telefon you'll draw 2 cards. A Smartfon in def lets you stack your deck as well, so you'll get to draw the cards you actually want (useful when you only have tuners on the field to ensure you can add a spell with Princessprite). When your field is full, link everything (besides Librarian) away for Saryuja to get 4 more draws (the special summon from hand is helpful too). Repeat using Telefon targeting another copy of itself/Junk Box and Pot of Avarice (shuffle Extra Deck monsters or Celfons to potentially make another copy of Machine Dupe live again) till you get all pieces. Consistent enough to get a decent hand and can play through some handtraps with Junk Box, since the -fons are all sopt's and Telefon can get enough Link fodder on the field with a good grave. You can also switch the one-of draw spells and Where arf thou? with a Crossout package to be better off against handtraps."

I hav","<span>Just some pile of cards i put together, there are no actual synergies except <strong>Branded</strong> and <strong>Dual Avatar</strong> locks your extra deck into fusion only, and <strong>Generaider</strong> and<strong> Dual Avatar </strong>both generate tokens</span>

<span>You could maybe put in <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Loptr%2C%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Generaider%20Bosses""><strong>Loptr</strong></a> for the normal summon to summon <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Mardel%2C%20Generaider%20Boss%20of%20Light""><strong>Mardel</strong></a> to search the <strong>Boss Stage</strong>, but usually <strong>Yuhi</strong> eat the normal summon more often when you didn't open <strong>Invitation</strong> or <strong>Fusion Deployment</strong></span>

<span>I didn't run any <strong>Dual Avatar </strong>trap even tho <strong>Kokoku</strong> could search it, i just feel like they're just not that good. You could run <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dual%20Avatar%20Ascendance""><strong>Dual Avatar Ascendance</strong></a> maybe just for a discard cost since it has a graveyard effect</span>

<span>You could change<strong> Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi</strong> for any other handtraps (And yeah the <strong>Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</strong> is there for its target)</span>

<span>You could also add <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Reinforcement%20of%20the%20Army""><strong>ROTA</strong></a> if you want, i just dunno what to change and i wanna keep the deck 40</span>

<span>And since <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Predaplant%20Verte%20Anaconda""><strong>Verte</strong></a> is banned, you have to hard draw the <strong>Branded Fusion</strong></span>
<h2><span>The Deck......Breakdown....?:</span></h2>
<ul>
 	<li><span><strong>Branded Fusion</strong> alone is an interruption on it's own, 1 card = <strong>Mirrorjade</strong>, non target monster banish</span></li>
 	<li><span><strong>Boss Stage</strong> or <strong>Boss Fight</strong> is also an interruption on it's own, just activate it, wait for your opponent's turn and pray they didn't have<strong><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ghost%20Ogre%20%26%20Snow%20Rabbit""> Ghost Ogre</a> </strong>or any quickplay backrow hate (or <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Token%20Collector""><strong>Token Collector</strong></a>), summon <strong>Harr</strong> for omni negate, <strong>Utgarda</strong> for another quick banish, or <strong>Hela</strong> if you have <strong>Harr/Utgarda</strong> in your gy</span></li>
 	<li><span><strong>Perfect Sync - A-Un</strong> could search <strong>Yuhi</strong>, normal summon it, use the field effect to summon a token, then use <strong>Yuhi</strong> effect to destroy the token to search <strong>Invitation</strong>, or if you don't open the field spell, <strong>Yuhi</strong> could destroy itself. If you already open <strong>Yuhi</strong> and <strong>Invitation</strong> you could search for <strong>Kokoku </strong>instead</span></li>
 	<li><span>If you're going first you would want to summon <strong>Mitsu-Jaku</strong> (for battle protection and quick destroy a monster that activates its effect) and <strong>Un-Gyo</strong> (For bad effect destruction protection and extra deck monster negation)</span></li>
 	<li><span>If you're going second you would want to summon <strong>Kon-Gyo </strong>(it could bounce a monster after damage calc and it has a target protection) and <strong>Ah-Gyo </strong>(to destroy atk position monster but it cannot atk this turn, and it could boost atk)</span></li>
</ul>

PUNK also ends on VFD off of 1 card. So, we're trying to cheese free games.

Still tuning this one (and TBH, learning VW lines). The deck is very good at making VFD, but struggles to back it with much out - either they can out it or they can't. Still, I decided to add a second Shenshen to the mix, so that you can use 1 with Dragon Mech for VFD and then put up Crocodragon and Shenshen alongside it.

This deck is pretty crazy - it makes VFD pretty easily, often through interruption, and Omega and Baroness (I respect milady's gender, unlike Konami!) also come up a lot more often than I thought they would. This list is pretty crazy in testing so far - VFD + Shenshen, + traps and sometimes another 8-10 synchro (Omega, Crocofish, or Baroness)

Still tuning the deck. Finding space for hand traps is tight in this format - you really want Gamma and Ghost Ogre, just for the E-Tele package, even though the format is a Maxx ""C"" format, and you just don't have the space for it IMO. Qinglong isn't great to see, but it will start VW plays with another VW, such a Lulu, so I wanted 3, but I also really wanted Foolish Burial Goods to be a Monster Reborn / ROTA for the deck (a little worse than that, since your gates do get used in combos, but it will enable plays). Ultimately, I cut it to 2 Qinglong to make space for the hand traps. PUNK engine is on 9 starters, down from 10 - this is a bit high, but it also means you can bait interruptions pretty well, and have great odds of starting with PUNK plays. 10 was a little too bricky, but I like the idea of using Ogre Dance for more consistency, even as a 1 of. I like 2 Chuche, I don't hate seeing the card, but it can be easily sent from the deck for its GY effect, it is better activated with the spell card than set in your combos, and it just doesn't do a lot in your combos. I'm considering Pot of Avarice - the deck already has a couple of ways to loop banished cards back into the deck, and this could rebuild your combos to pull it off again in a grind game, or even just make the Crocodragon a disruption instead of just an empty threat.

The hand trap line-up is pretty simple. I'm on 2 Ghost Ogre - running this makes E-Tele a disruptive card if it resolves, which is tight, and it helps that it is an emergency level 3 tuner. We've also got a suite out of respect to Maxx ""C"" - this is a combo deck that puts up a lot of bodies, so we need an insect answer. Called By is potentially a bannable card, and we're running both allowed copies. Ash is nice and generic, I think it is almost mandatory in a Maxx ""C"" format, but I'm on 2, because Gamma can also answer the insect while being higher quality as a disruption and defensive card. Gamma is the more important E-Tele target between it and Ghost Ogre - usually you'll be summoning a PUNK or VW card, but if not Gamma is enabling an Omega or Baroness. Lastly, there was space for a lone Maxx ""C"" - on the one hand, this is a super sacky 1 of, but on the other, with 2 ofs your other hand traps and no redundant copies, you won't have the problem of drawing Maxx ""C"" or other redundant interruptions as much as in a deck spamming 3 copies of its cards.

Cut Ghost Ogre - might be a good card in the shell once Brave hits the format, but in the meantime, there are too many other high quality targets for E-Tele to ever need to summon Ogre, and I needed space for the essentials. I'm still shy 1 Maxx ""C"" but there just isn't the space.

I'm testing a larger version of the deck - in theory, this should allow me to get better ratios on my hand traps, as well as giving me the space to run more tech cards. I'm at 55 cards, which means my PUNK package is about 1/5 of the deck (good odds for a 1/5 hand, no?). The VW part gets slightly sketchier, in theory, but in reality it seems absolutely fine. I decided that 55 cards with 3 Avarice would give me excellent ratios on my hand traps and VW starting combos, while also giving me a little bit of gas, and the ability to rebuild my extra deck in a grind game. I'm not sure Avarice will make the cut in the long run, it is kinda sketchy and a little bit ""win more"", but this deck could also genuinely use it after it has burnt up its combo to try again, and fills the GY very easily with either the PUNK or the VW engines. I cut Zeus, because it was barely coming up, and replace with with the PUNK Dragon, which will also probably barely come up, but hey, it's a really removal effect on the card, and the recovery is also nice, and besides, if I'm playing PUNK cards might as well make the new best 11 synch in the game.

Back to a nice, tight, 40 card list. The other list was consistent enough, but if the PUNK engine got stopped before Crocodragon it didn't consistently have Virtual World plays, which is sad, so instead we're running a much tighter list, with a single Ghost Ogre - you shouldn't usually need it off of E-Tele, but you often have it when you do."
