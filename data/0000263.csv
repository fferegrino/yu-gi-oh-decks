My personal favorite deck of all time. I've used Junk Stardust, Pend Magician / Z-ARC, Galaxy-Eyes, Elemental Heroes, Utopia, and Slime / God Card decks, and nothing so far tops this one in terms of fun for me. The combos are pretty simple and mostly revolve around getting Crimson Resonator out so you can get Supernova out on turn 1. Summon Crimson as the first monster so you can special summon it, and summon whatever Level 4 you have (preferably Wildwind so you still have a normal summon, but any of em work), go into Red Rising Dragon, use its effect, summon 2 more Resonators and go into Supernova. I'd recommend summoning Mirror Resonator and Creation Resonator so you can use Mirror Resonators effect in the future, or use it for plays with Chaos Ruler or Red Risings second effect. If Crimson gets negated, that's fine too, just go into Chaos Ruler and excavate the top 5 cards, and hopefully, that'll give you a counter play if you don't have a potential one in your hand already.  The main Extra Deck priorities are Red Rising, Chaos Ruler, Abyss, and Supernova. Red Rising is what allows most of the plays in the deck. Abyss is a once-per-turn Quick Effect negate and can summon more Resonators. Supernova can banish the opponents' entire field should they use a monster effect, and if they negate that, it still has a ton of ATK, getting 500 for each Resonator in the GY (which is a lot if you use combos correctly). Other cards, such as Samsara or Ancient Pixie, are there to fill space in case you don't get levels matching up to 6 or 8 with monsters you have in your hand (for example, if you only have Creation and Wildwind). Samsara is a good general defensive option, and Ancient Pixie has some very rare potential should you have Tilted Try up on the field. If you don't want to use Ancient Pixie, replace it with Exploder Dragonwing. Honestly, you could replace stuff like Galaxy Cyclone or Tilted Try with more meta cards, like Solemn Judgement / Called by the Grave / Forbidden Droplet, I just like using them because Skull Meister can function as a searchable but slightly weaker version of Called by the Grave, and I have a Royal Tilted Try (and it gives Ancient Pixie actual functionality), so I just like running it.  The main deck mostly consists of Resonators (Tuners) and 4* cards with search potential (WotBF, Wildwind, Stygian Street Patrol). Ascator is there in case you get a brick hand and only have him, so you can go into Chaos Ruler and potentially make a comeback. Ash Blossom and Maxx C are there just as basic hand traps. Red Reign is useful should you only have one Synchro on the field, or if you want to use it mid-turn before you start summoning other cards. Chain and Mirror are mostly there for low-level Resonator spam and for Chaos Ruler plays.  For an example of gameplay: https://youtu.be/0Yh9rMZ4hxA"

With these monsters you can then link off into traffic ghost and then if you have two more effect monsters you can summon Codebreaker Virus Swordsman (make sure you summon Virus Swordsman directly beneath traffic ghost) who will summon Codebreaker Zero-Day, with these you can then link off into Virus Berserker who will re-summon your two codebreakers whilst being able to destroy up to two spells and traps. Then with the two codebreakers you have just summoned, you want to use Traffic Ghost and Zero-Day to make a Rasterliger which can gain attack equal to a link monsters attack that's in either player's graveyard. So for example if your opponent has a Tri-Brigade Shuraig in their grave, you can then make Rasterliger gain 3000ATK making it have 5000ATK, meaning by the end of your turn you could have up to over 10000 damage on your field giving you more than enough to OTK your opponent.  Use cards like Dust Knight to put Gokipole in the grave to add a normal insect which you can then special summon and destroy a monster  Use Giant Rat to special summon any monster you might need with 1500ATK or less  Use Baobaboon to fix your hand so you have the cards you need (it's also a great way to put Codebreaker Zero Day on the bottom of your deck to stop you from bricking as you want it in your deck) and to also have multiple effect monsters on the field to help with your link summons  If you wanted to replace any cards then you could replace or even remove cards Like:Doom Dozer which can be replaced with something like Super Armored Robot Armed Black Iron ""C"", you can replace Man-Eater Bug with one of the Swarm Flip Monsters, you can replace Gigantes with Aztekipede, the Worm Warrior and then the back row can be anything you want as well as the XYZ monsters used in the Deck.  &nbsp;"

It is a blind going second Mekk-knight deck that has a side deck for boarding into going first with mainly an Orcust focus, the cost of this deck currently is about 220$, but it can be made for around 160$ if you replace 3 evenly matched with 3 Raigeki. I made this deck because I wanted a somewhat budget deck to play in the TCG after I found that I have a locals nearby. I have been playing Mekk-knights on master duel for about 2 months now, so I think this is the deck I would want to take to a locals. The other decks I play are a bit too complicated for me to play outside of a simulator or are much too expensive.  The side deck is to board out of all the going second cards for backrow and Scraps which act as Orcust starters. (manly board; Pankratops, 3 Evenly matched, 3 Dark ruler, 3 Gameciel, Mekk-knight red, Mekk-knight yellow, 1 Mekk-knight blue, 1 Mekk-knight indigo, and 1 World legacy memories, for everything in the side deck).  The main starters are Mekk-knight purple nightfall, Girsu and Mekk-knight blue sky. World legacy memories is a good starter if you are going second, but be careful as this card locks you into Mekk-knights, which will stop you from making Linkuriboh, Almiraj or summon World legacy tokens with Girsu's effect, which are used to create a column."

Recently discovering the existence of Numbers Evaille from the recent article here, which completely flew over my radar, I had a thought on how to use it as an engine. Basically, Seven Sins turbo. And what deck loves banishing? Well you clicked on this so you know. This might just be my memiest (that a word?) deck this far, apart from the Gustkraken loops I keep to myself, so grab a seat and get comfy, cuz this is about to get real. Shout outs to Therarely and Alice_YGO for making me entertain the idea of creating this abomination.  To explain the use of each card in the Deck: <ul>  	<li>Lord of the Heavenly Prison: Okay, this deck is more on the trap heavy side, so a beefy body while protecting your stuff doesn't hurt. Helps with otk and adds protection.</li>  	<li>Gizmek Orochi: A staple in Gren Maju decks, this fella banishes to summon itself and it even has a neat effect on field. Only a fool would run less than 3. Great discard fodder for astraltopia but that is another story.</li>  	<li>Dimension Shifter: Banish, banish and banish some more. Yeah it should be blindly obvious at this point.</li>  	<li>Necroface: If gets to banish then gren become stronk. Simple as that. Can even recycle your extra deck from cards like prosperity if need be.</li>  	<li>Astraltopia: The searcher for the engine. Unfortunately will use your NS but it is worth it. Discard Orochi if possible.</li>  	<li>Gren Maju Da Eiza: The boi himself, the heart and soul of this deck. NS after banishing tons of cards and punch for game.</li>  	<li>Eater of Millions: Banish for boi that removes by banishing. Need I explain why this is good?</li>  	<li>Numbers Evaille: Use this to summon the Seven Sins. Useless going first and against decks like monarchs, but you can change your side deck accordingly. Make sure to summon Orochi first before activating.</li>  	<li>Reinforcement of the Army: The searcher for the searcher, allowing essentially seven copies of Evaille.</li>  	<li>Pot of Desires: You would play three if possible but I guess those days are past us. Draw power and banish, what more do you want?</li>  	<li>Gold Sarcophagus: Banish Necroface, give chonk to Maju.</li>  	<li>Pot of Prosperity: Banish your ED for add power, all in all great.</li>  	<li>Storming Mirror Force: ""Lol no"" your opponent's monsters. With Heavenly Prison, this becomes quite threatening.</li>  	<li>Torrential Tribute: Last ditch move. If you have only Orochi, not that much. And with macro cosmos this becomes even better.</li>  	<li>Macro Cosmos: Steroids for the deck what else can I say?</li>  	<li>Solemn Strike and Judgement: Negates for rubbing insult to injury or for when you don't manage to otk.</li> </ul> The Extra Deck doesn't need that much analysing cuz it boils down to Seven Sins turbo. Select everything else and voila. A 4-material nuke with protection and a big chonk. 3 nukes at best, none at worst.  The side deck is moreso some S/T removal since the deck struggles with that and an alternative, more controllish engine with Harmonizer Gradielle for extra stalling until you stack up enough banished cards to finish your opponent in one blow.  Aaaaand that is it! As always, hope you like the deck, this is moi signing out. And remember, memes are the DNA of the soul."

The deck name ""Heresy"" is from a youtuber named Hardleg Gaming and the build is inspired by several handful of other Witchcrafter+Dogmatika builds I was able to find online.  The deck utilizes the Witchcrafter Engine, mainly, and is heavily reliant on tributing themselves in order to search out their spell cards as well as summon each other with very little effort. Because they resolve off-field when tributing themselves you get to play with cards like Psy-Frame Gamma when your opponent attempts to stop any of your effects with Ash Blossom.  Because all of the Witchcrafter spells add themselves back into your hand this allows for you to also play cards like Different Dimension Reincarnation, Phoenix Wind Blast, and Paleozoic Dinomischus if you wish.  &nbsp;  Highly recommended for players that aren't looking for anything hyper aggressive or spending ten minutes comboing off.  &nbsp;  **EDIT: Removed one of my Charmers from ED that aren't as common of an element for an additional Titaniklad. That will let me send a copy to the grave while still having an extra for Albaz."

Yes. They're actually fun to play, test them before you judge me.  Anyway, presenting Rikka Aromages.  <strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong>  This deck is surprisingly good enough in a slower format like the N/R rarity festival, because not only is it a control deck that utilizes your Aroma Spells/Traps for disruption, it can also combo out of nowhere and OTK with Xyz plays through your Rikka monsters. It also does not give a fuck about Kaijus, which is absolutely great, for the reasons that will be explained later. I'll go further in details in the list.  <strong>The main deck:</strong>  <strong>Monsters</strong>  <strong>• The Rikka monsters (<a data-name=""Hellebore the Rikka Fairy"">Hellebore</a>, <a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop</a>, <a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica</a>, <a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Petal</a>)</strong> - <span>Your main combo engine. They all do something about Tributing and in response to a Plant monster getting Tributed in any way, shape, or form. These are their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Hellebore the Rikka Fairy"">Hellebore </a>- <span>A hand trap that negates the effects of your opponent's monsters' activated effects. It can also Special Summon herself from the GY by Tributing any Plant monster but banishes herself when she leaves the field.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Snowdrop the Rikka Fairy"">Snowdrop </a>- <span>Your main combo starter. You're usually starting with either her and either Hellebore or Erica. Special Summons herself and 1 other Plant monster in your hand at a cost of Tributing a Plant monster. She also helps you with the Xyz plays by modulating the levels of all Plant monsters you currently control depending on the target's Level.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Erica the Rikka Fairy"">Erica </a>- <span>The Level 6 monster that you'll mostly be using for combos, and also the one you're gonna be searching the most with Petal. She's also a hand trap that boosts a battling Plant monster's ATK/DEF by Tributing herself, and like Hellebore, can also summon herself from the GY with the same said stipulations.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Primula the Rikka Fairy"">Primula </a>- <span>Your extender of the deck. Special Summons herself when a Plant monster you control is Tributed by any means (which will be relevant soon), and can also modulate the Levels of your two targeted Plant monsters by increasing their Levels by 2.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Rikka Petal"">Petal</a> - <span>Your main searcher of the deck. She searches any of your Rikka monsters during the Main Phase, except a copy of herself, and either adds it to your hand or sends it to the GY. She can also Special Summon herself from your GY during your opponent's End Phase, if you control no monsters, or all monsters you control are Plants.</span></li> </ol> <strong>• The Aroma monsters (<a data-name=""Aromage Bergamot"">Bergamot</a>, <a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Marjoram</a>, <a data-name=""Aromage Rosemary"">Rosemary</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Angelica"">Angelica</a>)</strong> - <span>Your main control engine. If you play Duel Links, you most likely already know what they do but regardless, these are their effects:</span> <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromage Bergamot"">Bergamot</a> - <span>Your game ender. If your LP is higher than your opponent, he grants all Plant monsters you control piercing, also if you gain LP while he's on the field, he gains 1000 ATK and DEF until the end of your opponent's next turn.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromage Marjoram"">Marjoram</a> - <span>Your GY disruption. If your LP is higher than your opponent, she grants you battle damage protection from attacks involving your Plant monsters, also if you gain LP while she's on the field, she can banish cards in your opponent's GY, up to the number of Aroma monsters you currently control.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromage Rosemary"">Rosemary</a> - <span>Your field disruption. If your LP is higher than your opponent, she grants your Plant monsters an <a data-name=""Armades, Keeper of Boundaries"">Armades</a> effect but only for monsters, also if you gain LP while she's on the field, she can change the battle position of 1 monster on the field. This is not a hard once per turn.</span></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aromaseraphy Angelica"">Angelica</a> - <span>Your main Tuner, if you ever feel like Synchro Summoning, but more importantly, she's a hand trap that can discard herself as a Quick Effect to gain LP equal to a targeted Aroma monster's ATK in the GY. She can also Special Summon herself from the GY if your LP is higher than your opponent's and control an Aroma monster, but banishes herself when she leaves the field.</span></li> </ol> <strong>Spells</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></strong> - <span>Backrow removal. Could also be <a data-name=""Nobleman of Extermination"">Nobleman of Extermination</a> if you wanna game harder.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aroma Garden"">Aroma Garden</a></strong> - <span>The archetypal Field Spell, at least for the Aromas. Its effect can be used to gain 500 LP and boost the ATK and DEF of all monsters you control by 500, if you control an Aroma monster, even if it leaves the field. Also, it heals you for 1000 LP when an Aroma monster is destroyed by battle or card effect, and this effect is not once per turn, which we will be abusing most of the time through our interactions.</span>  <strong>Traps</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Ballista Squad"">Ballista Squad</a></strong> - <span>Targets and destroys a card your opponent controls for a cost of Tributing, which is the most important part about this card, since it triggers our Rikka monsters' effects.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a></strong> - <span>Your 3-in-1 interruption. Just hover over the highlighted name to read, since they're too long lmao. Also, the main reason why most if not all of our Extra Deck monsters are Plant monsters.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Dried Winds"">Dried Winds</a></strong> - <span>Destroys an opponent's monster upon gaining LP, also allows you to pay LP if your LP is at least 3000 LP higher than your opponent's to destroy all of their monsters whose total ATK is less than or equal the amount paid.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Humid Winds"">Humid Winds</a></strong> - <span>Your main searcher, at a cost of paying 1000 LP, also allows you to gain 500 LP if your LP is lower than your opponent's.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Horn of Heaven"">Horn of Heaven</a></strong> - <span>An aggressive Counter Trap, which can be used in response to a potential Summon of an opponent's problematic monster at a cost of Tributing 1 monster, which makes it even better.</span>  <strong>The Extra Deck</strong>  You'll notice that most if not all of these cards are Plant monsters since they're recyclable by <a data-name=""Blessed Winds"">Blessed Winds</a>, although, one could obviously adjust the ratios of each card however much they see fit. I'm just saying.  The only Link monsters  <strong>• The Sunavalons (<a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryas"">Dryas</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Sunavalon Dryades"">Dryades</a>)</strong> - <span>There's no reason not to play these cards, especially since we're playing all Plant monsters.</span>  The Xyz monsters  <strong>• <a data-name=""Kanzashi the Rikka Queen"">Kanzashi the Rikka Queen</a></strong> - <span>Your Rikka boss monster, kinda, since she's the easiest to bring out turn one. She's a Rank 6 Plant Xyz monster that has an effect to detach an Xyz material when a monster(s) is Tributed and Special Summons a monster in either GY, but negating its effects, also makes it so that it is treated as a Plant. She also has a card effect destruction protection by Tributing 1 Plant monster from your hand or field as a replacement, but only once per turn.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Number 50: Blackship of Corn"">Number 50: Blackship of Corn</a></strong> - <span>A Rank 4 Plant Xyz monster that allows you to send a monster your opponent controls to the GY and inflict 1000 damage to your opponent, so long as it can be targeted.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Number 87: Queen of the Night"">Number 87: Queen of the Night</a></strong> - <span>Your ACTUAL boss monster, I think, since she's got the arguably best effects of all your Extra Deck monsters, while also having the best stats. She's a Rank 8 Plant Xyz monster that has a once per turn Quick Effect that can be one of the three effects in selection. Hover over her name to see the full details.</span>  The Synchro monsters  <strong>• <a data-name=""Periallis, Empress of Blossoms"">Periallis, Empress of Blossoms</a></strong> - <span>She's a Level 7 Plant Synchro monster that can once per turn Special Summon any Level 5 or higher Plant monster from your hand or GY. She also gets her ATK boosted by 400 for each Plant monster you control, except herself. This effect actually applies for both of its copies if you have two or three of her.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Splendid Rose"">Splendid Rose</a></strong> - <span>She's a Level 6 Plant Synchro monster that can be used to get over some problematic high ATK monsters that can be targeted, at a cost of banishing a Plant monster from your GY. She also has an effect that enables her to attack twice, at the same cost as stated but also halving her ATK until the end of the turn which may or may not come up.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Queen of Thorns"">Queen of Thorns</a></strong> - <span>Your main floodgate. She's a Level 6 Plant Synchro monster that makes it so that each player must pay 1000 LP for each monster Normal or Special Summoned from their hand, except for Plant-type monsters. Obviously, this will never be a downside for us.</span>  <strong>The side deck</strong>  More optional cards, as per usual.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Fairy Archer Ingunar"">Fairy Archer Ingunar</a></strong> - <span>A Level 6 Plant monster that could be a great extender if you wanna go more heavy on the Rikka engine for more Rank 6 plays.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""World Carrotweight Champion"">World Carrotweight Champion</a></strong> - <span>Always a good one of extender from the GY that can also set up your GY for Plant decks.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Evilswarm Mandragora"">Evilswarm Mandragora</a></strong> - <span>A Level 4 Cyber Dragon for Plants, commonly seen in Rank 4 toolbox decks back in the day.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aromage Cananga"">Aromage Cananga</a></strong> - <span>A Level 3 Plant monster that can be used as coverage for more Spell/Trap disruption by bouncing that card to the hand, also has an effect that makes it so all your opponent's monsters lose 500 ATK and DEF if your LP is higher than theirs.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aromage Laurel"">Aromage Laurel</a></strong> - <span>A Level 1 Plant monster that's a good extender if you wanna go more heavy on the Aromage engine for more Synchro plays, since it has an effect that it can make a non-Tuner Plant monster a Tuner if you gain LP. It also makes you gain LP upon getting sent to the GY by any means.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Aroma Jar"">Aroma Jar</a></strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Marshmallon"">Marshmallon</a> that makes you gain LP during the End Phase. Great for a more stall dedicated strategy.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Evil Thorn"">Evil Thorn</a></strong> - <span>Free Link 2 on board while burning your opponent, and more importantly, it Tributes for cost.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a></strong> - <span>Tribute either your Hellebore or Snowdrop; Draw 2 cards. It's not once per turn.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Share the Pain"">Share the Pain</a></strong> - <span>A non-targeting, non-destruction removal, that also Tributes for cost. Bro...</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Enemy Controller"">Enemy Controller</a></strong> - <span>A decent combat trick that allows you to either switch a monster's battle position, OR better yet, Tribute a monster for cost to take control of an opponent's monster until the End Phase, so long as it can be targeted.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Wall of Thorns"">Wall of Thorns</a></strong> - <span><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a> for Plants.</span>  <strong>• <a data-name=""Spiritual Water Art - Aoi"">Spiritual Water Art - Aoi</a></strong> - <span>This is unironically good with this deck, since most of our main deck monsters are WATER monsters, and the best part is as per usual, it's a <a data-name=""Confiscation"">Confiscation</a> that Tributes for cost.</span>  <strong>• The utility Paleos (<a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Dinomischus</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Paleozoic Canadia"">Canadia</a>)</strong> - <span>A <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">MST</a>, a <a data-name=""Dark Core"">Dark Core</a>, and a <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a>, respectively. Also works with Spiritual Water Art - Aoi, funny enough.</span>  Honorable mentions are the usual staples such as <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, <a data-name=""Bottomless Trap Hole"">Bottomless Trap Hole</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a>, <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a>, and many more.  <strong>Final thoughts</strong>  This deck is actually fun to play. It does not require a lot of negates to interact with and disrupt your opponent. Even though it can easily be as aggressive as much as you want it to be at any point, it's also not hard to just go back into the defensive whenever something goes wrong, but since you're still utilizing some control cards, you still need to keep constant track of your resources. In fact, I've had so much fun playing this deck that I might actually build this in MD in the future and test more versions of Rikka as a more consistent and coherent strategy, because I just love building under explored and underestimated archetypes. But I gotta say, there will be awkward hands that won't be straightforward to play, so you just gotta be mindful of making plays with them. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

Of course, Beetrooper doesn't exist in Master Duel but many of the cards used in the deck are available for use in <strong>Event N/R</strong>. Among them, the <strong>Battlewasp archetype</strong> and the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> engine stand out, which has <strong>synergy with Normal Insect monsters</strong>, allowing you to play fun games throughout the duel. The main idea of ​​the deck is focused on taking <strong>advantage of the floating effects of the main Insect monsters</strong> of the deck that even if they are destroyed or leave the field they <strong>give you an advantage</strong> in the form of Special Summoning from the Deck or adding Insects to the hand. These cards are:  <a data-name=""Battlewasp - Sting the Poison"">Battlewasp - Sting the Poison</a>, basically it is a <strong>""Stratos""</strong> from the <strong>Battlewasp archetype</strong> and normally you will add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> to the hand which is a great <strong>Follow Up</strong> for your next turn by Special Summoning <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> back to the field and <strong>allow you Synchro plays</strong> such as SYNCHRO-6 <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a>. If you already have the Arbalest in your hand you can add 1 of the <strong>Battlewasp Extenders</strong> in place like <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> or <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> so they enter the field allowing you to make Synchro plays like the SYNCHRO-5 <a data-name=""Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Azusa the Ghost Bow</a> or some LINK-2 like <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"">Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</a>. The <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> and <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> Extenders also have field effects, with the <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> dealing <strong>200 damage</strong> to the opponent and the <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> being able to do <strong>2 Attacks during the Battle Phase</strong> which means inflicting 2000 damage per battle. (Remember that Twinbow the Attacker <strong>locks you into Insects for the rest of the turn</strong> if you Special Summon it by its own effect).  - <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a>, this is one of my favorite Insect monsters because if it is <strong>sent to the GY</strong> you will be able to <strong>add a Level 4 Insect to your hand</strong>, and if you add a <strong>Normal Monster</strong> with this effect, you can Special Summon it. and <strong>destroy a Monster on the field with ATK equal to or greater than that of the Normal monster</strong>. That is, in this deck, he will either add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> to the hand that as I said is a <strong>great Follow Up</strong> to be your Normal Summon or it will be <strong>an interaction</strong> with the opponent by adding you to Vanilla <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot;"">Shiny Black ""C""</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Shiny Black &quot;C&quot;&quot;&gt;Shiny Black &quot;C&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Squadder""> Squadder</a> that will enter the field and <strong>destroy an opponent's monster with 2k ATK or more without targeting</strong>. It happens a lot that you set <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> face-down and the opponent destroys him in battle and you use your interaction effect by bringing Vanilla from the deck and destroying his monster by taking him by surprise because no one expects that to happen. (Detail that you have to pay attention is that he <strong>can destroy your monsters too</strong>, so in <strong>Master Duel</strong> if the opponent doesn't have a monster that can be destroyed but the <strong>message to destroy a monster on the field appears, you click No</strong> because what will happen would be to destroy your own monster).  - <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> besides being a <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> of the Small Insects in Normal Summon (Special Summon doesn't work), it has <strong>excellent Floating effect</strong> when destroyed by an opponent's card you <strong>Special Summon a Battlewasp Monster straight from the Deck</strong> which is very beneficial. So even if your opponent negates his Normal Summon effect with <a data-name=""Forbidden Chalice"">Forbidden Chalice</a> you can go into the battle phase and <strong>crash the Arbalest into an opponent's monster</strong> just to Special Summon <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> straight from the deck which will add another Battlewasp Monster on top of that to the hand.  Just by knowing what the 3 main monsters in the Main Deck do, you can see why the deck works: You can have <strong>plays every turn when Looping your own monsters</strong>, for example: <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> Add <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> and Arbalest the Rapidfire Reborn Sting the Poison that can add you another Arbalest the Rapidfire so the Loop never ends. Same goes for <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> where Gokipole Add Arbalest and Arbalest Reborn Gokipole and <strong>did all the Resource Loop again</strong>.  - Finally, speaking of <strong>Floating effects</strong>, we have the excellent Field Spell <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> that whenever any monster you control is destroyed by an opponent's card effect, you can <strong>Special Summon a Normal Insect from your GY</strong>, which in this case will always be <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a>. But <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> main function is its <strong>Damage Calculation effect</strong> which allows you to avoid taking battle damage (either you or your opponent) to <strong>send a Level 4 or lower Insect from your Deck to the GY</strong>. Then we can send the <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> that will activate its effect of adding an Insect to the hand that you will choose if it will be <strong>Follow Up</strong> through <a data-name=""Arbalest"">Arbalest</a> or it will be <strong>interaction</strong> through Vanilla or even more interesting is to send the <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> because like you sent a Normal Monster by the effect of <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> you will simply be able to <strong>Special Summon any number of copies of it to the field</strong> of your hand, Deck and/or GY which means having 3 <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> on the field to attack with them and do a lot of damage and in Main Phase 2 make Synchro, Xyz or Link plays.  Talking about the tech cards used in the deck: <a data-name=""Lightning Vortex"">Lightning Vortex</a> and <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> <strong>don't have such a high cost</strong> in this deck because both <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> and <a data-name=""Shiny Black &quot;C&quot; Squadder"">Shiny Black ""C"" Squadder</a> are good discards since with <a data-name=""Giant Ballpark"">Giant Ballpark</a> you reborn Vanilla from GY and <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> becomes a Search from <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> or Vanilla to enter the field and destroy an opponent's monster. So basically you can <strong>still get value out of your Monsters even after discarding them</strong> to the GY even if you discard a Battlewasp as you can use <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a> to bring <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> back to the field and still get a Search for free.  Speaking of <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a>, it allows you to make very strong plays, especially in the Grind Game, such as giving Reborn from <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> that adds <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> and as you didn't spend your Normal Summon you still bring the Arbalest to the field that goes give you Reborn from another GY Insect and in the end with <strong>just one card you managed to bring three Monsters to the field</strong> to make plays mainly from Synchro and Xyz RANK-3. On top of that <a data-name=""Revival Swarm"">Revival Swarm</a> has an excellent effect on the GY of targeting an Insect you control like <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> and it <strong>cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects until the end of the opponent's turn, including your cards</strong>. So even if you use <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> you will still have the monster protected.  <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> is very valuable in this deck because you will continue to generate an advantage by destroying monsters like <a data-name=""Gokipole"">Gokipole</a> for example, so losing cards on the field is not that big of a problem for you. <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a> has the versatility of being able to destroy both Monsters or Spells/Traps too because if the opponent has a monster with <strong>1700ATK or less</strong> you send the <a data-name=""Fossil Machine Skull Wagon"">Fossil Machine Skull Wagon</a> to the GY instead of the <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon</a> and it has GY effect banish yourself to <strong>target and destroy a Spell/Trap</strong> on the field. So even not using <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> you still have 6 Spell Trap outs in the deck which are 3 <a data-name=""Raigeki Break"">Raigeki Break</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>. <a data-name=""Ring of Destruction"">Ring of Destruction</a> I'm just using it to receive rewards of causing Burn on the opponent, you could be using <a data-name=""Needle Ceiling"">Needle Ceiling</a> instead for example it's a card that does the <strong>same role as Torrential Tribute</strong> but only for <strong>Face-Up monsters</strong> so if you have a monster Face-Down and your opponent has 3 Monsters Face-Up you use Needle Ceiling and destroy all their monsters but keep your monster on the field.  The main Extra Deck Monsters are the Synchro Battlewasp <a data-name=""Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Azusa the Ghost Bow</a> and <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a>, being Azusa a card that has a <strong>good effect of causing Burn</strong> to the opponent but the main factor is <strong>that it is Tuner</strong> so if you use <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> + <strong>any Lv3</strong> Monster to make it and have <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> on the field you use both to make <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> which is the <strong>deck's win condition</strong> because it basically takes away <strong>any monster with 5k or less ATK</strong> in battle as it cuts ATK of the opponent's monster in half which means <strong>trigger the effect</strong> of <a data-name=""Azusa the Ghost Bow"">Azusa the Ghost Bow</a> to <strong>return to the field from GY</strong> and that way you have both Synchro of the archetype on the field to control the game.  <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> is such a <strong>good Boss Monster in this format</strong> that for example there was an Infinitrack Gadget Train player who did turn 1 the <a data-name=""Ravenous Tarantula"">Ravenous Tarantula</a> and on top did <a data-name=""Pain Gainer"">Pain Gainer</a>, followed by The <a data-name=""Seven Sins"">Seven Sins</a> which means ending up with a <strong>4k ATK monster with 4 materials and protection against destruction</strong> when detach 2 Materials. But with only 1 <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> <strong>and 1 Extender</strong> I dealt with this boss monster because I added <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> to the hand (Follow Up) and brought <a data-name=""Pin the Bullseye"">Pin the Bullseye</a> to the field and set <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> and on his turn if he gave summon any monster I would activate <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> and chain <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> to <strong>Tribute Pin the Bullseye</strong> and <strong>negate the effects of Seven Sins</strong> and that way he would <strong>lose protection from destruction</strong> and the entire field would be cleared. My opponent was smart and decided to go into the battle phase to force negate the Sting the Poison I used and then decided to spend the turn playing around Torrential Tribute. But since I had <a data-name=""Arbalest the Rapidfire"">Arbalest the Rapidfire</a> from Follow Up I simply Normal Summoned it and reborn <a data-name=""Sting the Poison"">Sting the Poison</a> which added <a data-name=""Twinbow the Attacker"">Twinbow the Attacker</a> to enter the field to be Sting the Poison's tribute to <strong>negate</strong> <a data-name=""Seven Sins"">Seven Sins</a> again and this time I didn't even need to use Torrential Tribute once because it was just <a data-name=""Halberd the Charge"">Halberd the Charge</a> that I took it out in the Battle Phase by cutting its ATK in half. That is, the <strong>deck has outs within the engine itself for practically all boss monsters of this format</strong>, either negating their effects and destroying them with the traps used or taking them out in battle.  About the Extra Deck's Link Monsters, <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"">Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</a> is very good in this deck because you <strong>easily put two monsters on the field</strong> and often they are of levels that don't allow you to Synchro or Xyz Summon so what's left is for you to use them to do it this Codebreaker that has <a data-name=""absurd 2300ATK"">absurd 2300ATK</a> which is very high for a Link-2 monster and its main factor besides ATK is that it has <strong>excellent Floating effect if the opponent destroys it either by card effect or by battle it will return to the field in the End Phase</strong>. And this is relevant because not only does it <strong>keep card advantage but as it leaves the Extra Monster Zone</strong> you can return it to one of the columns of the Extra Monster Zone that are not occupied and on your turn do the <a data-name=""Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino"">Shinobi Insect Hagakuremino</a> pointing at it which means that the opponent <strong>can't target the Shinobi for attacks</strong> so it's a card that stays on the field for a long time until you come back into play. Shinobi as well as <a data-name=""Geonator Transverser"">Geonator Transverser</a> has the function of <strong>punishing players who place their monsters in the wrong zones</strong> so you can take advantage of that.  The <a data-name=""Number 20: Giga-Brilliant"">Number 20: Giga-Brilliant</a> and <a data-name=""Number 70: Malevolent Sin"">Number 70: Malevolent Sin</a> as they are Insect-type Xyz monsters can be used as material to make the <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a> on top which in addition to good ATK status has an excellent effect of <strong>shuffle a monster in opponent's defense position into deck</strong> and can even <strong>attach Insects from your GY</strong> to it to keep using this effect again. Just be careful that as you need to <strong>detach 2 Xyz materials to summon</strong> the <a data-name=""Digital Bug Corebage"">Digital Bug Corebage</a> on top if you use the effect of one of these Xyz you won't be able to do the Corebage on top later.  <a data-name=""Number 49: Fortune Tune"">Number 49: Fortune Tune</a> is a utility card that <strong>survives on the field for several turns</strong> as it cannot be targeted by cards and still protects itself from destruction including your cards like <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a> while <strong>giving you 500LP every Standby Phase</strong>. And when the opponent finally takes him out of the field you use his effect to return him and two level3 monsters to the deck <strong>recycling their cards</strong> to do it again if necessary. <a data-name=""Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse"">Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse</a> and <a data-name=""Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow"">Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow</a> are the best possible interactions to do in this N/R format. <a data-name=""Gossip Shadow"">Gossip Shadow</a> is a <strong>monster negate</strong> as the effect makes <strong>both players draw 1 card</strong> and <a data-name=""Mech Beast Grampulse"">Mech Beast Grampulse</a> is a <strong>Spell/Trap pop every turn</strong>.  Disregard the Side Deck, they are just examples of cards that you can test in the main deck.  &nbsp;"

Surprisingly, this fan favourite girl has most of her cards available in Normal/Rare! This means that a somewhat functional albeit weaker Sky Striker strategy is viable in the N/R format. There is no Engage, Kagari, Shizuku, Widow Anchor, Zeke, and Hornet Drones, but these ladies can still pack quite a punch!  The usual Sky Striker strategy is used - wear down your opponent with net gain trades using spell cards to win in a drawn out grind game. 6 potent equip spells are in the deck to allow the Strikers to beat down your opponent's monsters.  The Extra Deck Strikers only feature 3 Hayate and Kaina. The rest are rank 4 toolbox and generic link monsters.  And remember... RAYE IS BAYE!!!

As you can see I've cut down the Marincess core and added yet more goodstuff plus crossout-designator and fodders for it. I also decided to go a little over the 40 cards which seems, at least to me, suprisingly good. There is no actual combo for the deck since you utilize your extenders to at least bring out Aqua Argonaut on your first turn, if you play first. I'm open to any suggestions you guys may have."

Thankfully, with the power of reprints from the Albaz Strike structure deck, and some staples from the Charmer and Cyber Strike Structures to really enhance the playability of the strategy in these times of DPE Scythe spam for the budget, but realistically this deck, even full build with Prosperities and Small Worlds, albeit extremely consistent, does not put up a strong board on it's own. The deck puts up one negate, and a GY shuffle. Another issue is it's absolutely required, yet disgusting brick in Madolche Messengelato. The cards in this deck that you would use to summon Messengelato, which would be Puddingcess Chocolat-A-la-Mode and Hootcake, CANNOT summon from hand. If they would please give us something to shuffle Messengelato back and more in-archetype interruption, I think it'd make it go from rogue to absolutely able to handle the meta.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

From there, you can get out the boss of the morphtronics, power tool dragon, or baronne de fleur for the powerful negate effect.  You can get out halq with any tuner and another monster, so you're relying on celfon to get out a tuner, or scopen to pull a non-tuner level 4 out of your hand. scopen plus a level 4 can also just lead into a level 7 synchro, and remoten helps fish scopen or more copies of celfon and smartfon. smartfon is a good fisher and a tuner you can special summon out of your hand, which also helps fulfil halq's summoning requirements.  Overall, it's not a meta deck, it's not even rogue, but it can win pretty well against other non-meta decks and can even lock horns pretty well with rogue decks like melffy or ghostricks. Baronne de Fleur is really good destruction power and a negate, you get out Accesscode talker pretty easily, and the fact that smartfon and celfon aren't limited to once per turn helps you swarm the field, especially if you manage to land machine dulplication on celfon.  An important note is that smartfon is a special summon monster, so it's not a valid target for machine duplucation. You'll be using that on celfon and remoten.  Some substitutes: radion is a thunder monster rather than a machine, so feel free to swap it out for another boomboxen or slingen, but tbh radion's attack boost is genuinely good when you have a swarm of morphtronics out. In addition, trident warrior can always be swapped for another goblindburgh for the ability to get out celfon with it, too, but sometimes trident warrior's 1800 attack does end up mattering when against a bricking deck that has a decently sized monster on the board."

It is not. It is an N. I checked. I don't know why it believes this is the case. But if you clicked here because of the comedy of 'haha this loser's using an SR in the N/R' format, hi! Enjoy the decklist!)  The N/R Festival is here in Master Duel; a chance to try decks far more interesting than anything in the Platinum ladder with essentially no cost. As someone who climbed into platinum using none other than a Paleozoic deck already, I decided 'hey wouldn't it be funny if I did that here too'? And so here we are!  This deck combines the powers of the Paleozoic trap-""monster"" lineup, the few decent Frogs at N/R, and the severely-underrepresented Aquaactress archetype into a single deck that boasts both disruption and sheer unga bunga power on tiny little aquatic entities. It's heavily based off <a>this list</a> made by DevilDeckYGO and direYGO (read: I netdecked for the groundworks and modified it from there), so credit where credit is due on that one. With that said, let's get into how the deck works! <h2>Step 1: Setting the Stage</h2> The heart and soul of this deck is your Field Spell and your trio of Continuous Spells. <strong>Wetlands</strong> gives all Level 2 or lower Water Aqua monsters 1200 attack; this is functionally your entire monster lineup (save two), because for some reason the Aquaactresses are Aqua despite <em>clearly </em>being fishes. Well, I won't complain. Meanwhile, the Aquarium trio all provide benefits to your WATER monsters and/or your Aquaactresses, and revive an Aqua from the grave if your foe ever removes them.  Three <strong>Aquaactress Tetra </strong>provides a scary amount of consistency; the longer it's allowed to stay on the board, the more cards it can fetch you, and you can even activate multiples of it in one turn! For this reason, <strong>Aquarium Stage</strong> is one of the most ideal searches if you're not going on the offensive - it gives your WATER monsters battle protection and your Aquaactresses specifically protection from -all- monster effects. I can't count the times foes have attempted to fire a Malevolent Sin or Relinquished only to accomplish nothing.  <strong>Aquarium Set </strong>provides a moderate 300 ATK boost to all WATER monsters and an additional 300 to Aquaactresses specifically. It's a decent choice if you already have Stage or are up against a deck that primarily uses backrow-based removal, and it's also very funny to put a new meaning to the phrase ""Set, pass"". <strong>Aquarium Lighting</strong> is the weirdest of the three, doubling attack when battling enemy monsters, but only for Aquaactresses specifically. Don't take this one unless you specifically both already have an Aquaactress and either Set or Wetlands online.  Of the other two Aquaactresses, <strong>Guppy </strong>summons an Actress from hand, and <strong>Arowana </strong>searches one from deck. I'm only running one of each of these because Guppy's useless unless you already have one of the others in hand, and Arowana needs you to tribute. Which isn't super difficult in this deck - it's easy enough to get a Paleozoic or Ronintoadin on the field - but it's still an investment (and one that can end up falling down a Bottomless Trap Hole all too easily). Needless to say, Tetra is the best of the three. <h2>Step 2: A Chorus of Croaks</h2> No Toadally Awesome in this format, but wetlands girls make do. Your frogs are an excellent way to squeeze out value over the opponent, and can become surprisingly bulky with Wetlands up.  Whether you've seen its lock or simply its advantage-gathering, you probably already know what <strong>Dupe Frog</strong> does, but <strong>Flip Flop Frog </strong>is another story. It's similar to the PACMAN cast of reusable flip-esque monsters, but unlike them, its effect fires even when flipped face up by an opponent's attack. This means Flip Flop Frog at least trades with anything attacking into it, but it gets better for three simple reasons; <ol>  	<li>Flip Flop Frog's effect is <strong>non-targeting, non-destroying removal</strong>. This means it gets around annoying thorns in the meta's side such as Invoked Cocytus or Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon (not MAX, the other one).</li>  	<li><strong>The more Frogs you have on the board, the better Flip Flop gets.</strong> Ronintoadin is a frog while it's on the field, so it's easy to bounce two or more cards on your turn and then go for a lot of damage.</li>  	<li><strong>Aquarium Stage is Flip Flop Frog's best friend. </strong>Your opponent attacks into your Flip Flop Frog, gets bounced, and Flip Flop stays alive, ready to return more cards to the hand the next turn.</li> </ol> And then we have one copy of <strong>Unifrog</strong>, who... exists. It's a bit of a silly high-roll tech choice, and you can cut it if you want, but it's searchable off Dupe Frog and gives you a way to pick away at backrow-heavy decks beyond just your Paleozoic traps.  We also have two monsters that -aren't- frogs but will be included here for brevity's sake. <strong>Dewdark of the Ice Barrier </strong>is a beatstick and Gagaga Cowboy-esque gamecloser tool. He has 1200 ATK normally, 2400 under Wetlands and more with an Aquarium Set or two involved, and can attack directly. This list runs him at 2, but feel free to modify up or down based on preference. Finally, my extreme jank tech, <strong>Mother Grizzly. </strong>Yes, a recruiter from 2004. Why? Because this format is slow enough that set monsters aren't necessarily being destroyed by effects a majority of the time, and she is one of the only ways you can search either Flip Flop Frog or Aquaactress Tetra, the two most crucial monsters for your plans. <h2>Interlude: The Back Row</h2> The Paleozoic lineup to this deck is really quite simple. 3 apiece of <strong>Olenoides, Canadia, </strong>and <strong>Dinomischus.</strong> (Oh and a single <strong>Torrential Tribute.</strong>) Olenoides is the primary form of backrow removal you have access to. In a format this slow, it's going to be very handy. If you can, fire it during the opponent's End Phase after they've set cards in order to render them inactive. Canadia is a fantastic form of disruption by setting your foes' monsters face down, and Dinomischus is the most powerful by banishing ANY face up card... but has the cost of a discard. Perhaps more notably in this deck than any other, Paleozoics can revive upon either player activating a trap card! They start off at 1200 ATK, <strong>but easily reach 2400 or higher after a Wetlands, </strong>just like Dewdark. Extra notable (and often forgotten) is that they're also immune to all monster effects when summoned this way, making them powerful beatsticks that are difficult to out via monsters! Just remember that they -will- be banished upon leaving the field unless you tuck them snugly under an Xyz Monster. <h2>Step 3: Special Guests from the Extra Deck</h2> Hoo boy. The Extra Deck options in the N/R Festival are... messy, let's say. But there's a lot of fun in that mess, so here's the rundown on the Extra Deck options this deck plays! You don't go into these super frequently, in all honesty.  <strong>Number 54: Lion Heart </strong>and <strong>Number 39: Utopia Roots</strong> are both made via three or two Tetra respectively, and either bounce battle damage and have battle immunity or negate attacks and power up vs. Xyz decks, but... well, you'll make these once in a blue moon at best. Feel free to cut them for more copies of the relevant extra deck.  The rest of your Xyz are all Rank 2, and thus more accessible. Of them, the best two are <strong>The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin, </strong>which negates a monster's effect and sucks its attack to 0, and <strong>Number 45: Crumble Logos the (et cetera), </strong>who has higher attack (2200 vs. 1600) and can negate backrow <em>or</em> monsters (as well as all other cards sharing that card's name while it remains on the field), but can't lower attack. We play 2 Javelin and 1 Logos here; if you cut anything from this extra deck, you probably can't go wrong with adding a second Logos. Out of the other Rank 2 Xyz, <strong>Herald of Pure Lights </strong>cycles cards from grave to hand to deck, but doesn't provide much advantage unless you URGENTLY need a monster from grave to hand, and <strong>Cat Shark,</strong> who is a wall you could also use to make your Logos a 4400 ATK beatstick sometimes.  The other half of the Extra Deck is links. Starting off with the two you'll be going into the most - <strong>Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</strong> is an excellently sized body for a link-2 that even revives itself once on destruction (though this won't help you against Bottomless Trap Hole), and <strong>Geonator Transverser, </strong>a serious contender for underrated MVP of the deck. Being able to swap spare weak monsters with your foes' main powerhouse comes up more often than you'd think. Watch the zones and wait for your chance.  If your opponent isn't using backrow-based monster removal, <strong>Doublebyte Dragon</strong> can just straight up win you the game, and <strong>Gravity Controller</strong> is an out for if your foe tries to do the same against you. <strong>Pentestag</strong> lets those Wetlands-boosted beatsticks break through wally foes, and <strong>Powercode Talker </strong>is at once both beatstick and effect negation. <strong>Triple Burst Dragon</strong> is just okay, feel free to cut it.  Finally, <strong>Marincess Marbled Rock</strong> is a water link. Yup, that's it. You literally can't use any of her effects, but tragically enough, you have <em>no</em> better options. <h2>Step 4: Okay, So How Do I Actually Play The Deck</h2> The number of traps you have, as well as monsters that activate best on destruction, means that first and foremost you want to go first. Don't activate your Aquariums (except for Stage) if you don't have to (i.e. not summoning an Aquaactress turn one) - the lack of information means leaving your opponents uncertain of your deck and thus less likely to play around Paleozoics/Flip Flop Frog/etc. If you have Stage and Dupe Frog in hand, it's sometimes best not to activate Stage at all, letting Dupe Frog die and thus loading your grave for an eventual Ronin as well as finding you Flip Flop. This is up to your own preference, though. Your main goal early game is to disrupt your foe's plays with your Paleozoics and Frogs before pivoting into violence through Wetlands. Some games you won't draw Wetlands at all, and that's fine; you can either chip down your opponent or attempt to use the Extra Deck instead. Don't fall for the temptation of going into your Extra Deck at the first moment, though! A lot of the times it's better to leave your aqua monsters on the field to be protected by Stage or to get the effects of cards such as Tetra or Dupe Frog. Keep a card in hand for Dinomischus where possible. Your ideal discard is Ronintoadin as an excellent way to get it into the grave, but anything works. Also, remember; both Stage-protected Aquaactress monsters and Paleozoics are immune to monster effects. This means your main threats are backrow removal (backrow that destroys monsters) and backrow removal (cards that get rid of your spells and traps). Watch your opponent's traps and make careful guesses as to what they might be; a well-timed Torrential Tribute can put you out of the game altogether. Other than all of that, this deck isn't too complex to pilot once you know what you're doing. Good luck, and enjoy your time frogging! <h2>Afterword: Other Options</h2> <strong>The ratio and types of backrow </strong>this deck uses is entirely up to you. <strong>Lost Wind, Bottomless Trap Hole, </strong>and more copies of <strong>Torrential Tribute</strong> are all great for disrupting plays.  <strong>Moray of Greed</strong> could prove useful with a higher quotient of monsters, but the fact that we're at almost exactly a 20:10:10 ratio means it's less likely to activate.  <strong>Dragon Queen of Tragic Endings</strong> is very very funny - summoning itself when you control 3+ Continuous Spells, drawing a card and making the foe discard when it deals battle damage, and reviving itself by sending a continuous spell to the grave, which also triggers your Aquariums' revive effects. It's a bit too highroll-y for my liking, but hey, give it a shot if you feel like it. <strong>Magical Broker</strong> is another way to trigger your own revival effects and also stalls for time if need be. Hooray for slow formats.  Given that Dewdark is a tuner, you could probably choose to run them at 3 and a Level 4 Synchro of your choice, of which this format has a grand total of six. Out of them, <strong>Old Entity Hastorr </strong>is probably your best bet.  <strong>Every single Paleozoic backrow </strong>is N/R. Customize as to your want.  <strong>More backrow-removing tools </strong>is highly welcomed; as both your Paleozoics (by default) and Aquaactresses (under Stage) are immune to monster effects, backrow-based disruption is their Achilles' heel. <strong>Mystical Space Typhoon, Nobleman of Extermination, </strong>and <strong>Mythical Beast Garuda</strong> are all fair options.  You can attempt to run a heavier Marincess package; both of their Link-1s are available at Rare, plus the sheer power of <strong>Marincess Wave</strong> is not to be overlooked. If you want to simply splash one in to recover off Marbled Rock, <strong>Marincess Basilalima</strong> is the most generic, I guess.  And of course, for sheer style points, accept <strong>Frog the Jam </strong>into your heart and deck-- eh? whaddya mean it's called <strong>Slime Toad</strong> now?  Thanks for reading, and feel free to comment with any severe deckbuilding issues I may have made down below!"

Sycthe Lock(For Those Who don't know): Only do this if you brick and are going first TBH, it's a very breakable board but just start by getting at least 2 monsters out to make Dagda and then start a chain with another card in your hand to trigger and set<a data-name=""Artifact Sycthe""> Artifact Sycthe</a> then get a third monster out and go into verte so you can copy <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> to Summon <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>. On Standby of your oppnent's next turn trigger Phoenix Enforcer's effect and pop your own sycthe and one other card on your field(or itself if you must) to trigger Sycthe and lock your oppnent's plays from extra deck that turn. Very effective against decks like D/D/D or Dragon Links but not very effective against Flowandereeze. If you're unsure then you can wait till Mainphase 1 do this simple chain if it wasn't Flowandereeze or use enforcer to disrupt w/e deck it is that doesn't use extra deck like popping their key cards..  Let's say you start on a good hand, it doesn't matter which drytron you start with as they can eventually extend to each other but ideally you want to end with Beta fafnir and send Metonis if it's not in your hand to the grave and then add it back with it's effect. If you don't have Benten try to get to it as this deck thrives on more rituals being in the grave for Megalith's Bethor's disruptive destruction effect or Aratron's negates. If you go for the megalith plays you go from <a data-name=""Megalith Ophiel"">Megalith Ophiel</a> (To get Hagith)-&gt;Megalith Hagith to add <a data-name=""Megalith Portal"">Megalith Portal </a>in your hand from Hagith's effect or if you already have it get <a data-name=""Megalith Emergence"">Megalith Emergence</a> -&gt; Then with <a data-name=""Meteonis Drytron"">Meteonis Drytron </a>summon back Ophiel field to add Megalith Phul -&gt; Use Hagith's effect to ritual into Phul and end your turn there-ish. These are just the barebones combo's but your Keycards are Hagith, Ophiel, and Phul. Och is in the deck in case you have a somewhat deadhand and want to use it's Dark World Dealings effect, it also has the benefit of being use as a medium to ritual summon like the other megalith's but like Phul it can do it on the oppnent's turn.  After that you just  go for what you need using Phul's effect, if your oppnent is combo-ing wait till they have 2-3 cards on board to triggle <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a>and pull <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> from your deck using the ritual monsters on field and hand to summon it as it gets to pop one card you oppnent controls for each ritual based monster in your grave. If you're finnishing off your oppnent then use Phul's effect to get Phaleg whic boost your atk/def stats by 500 for all monsters on your field for every ritual monster in your grave. Aratron is just in here in case your board is strong but lacks protection and you don't need Bethor's effect to popping and just want extra protection. Like for instance you end on Masq +Utopic Draco Future/Divine Arsenal Zeus.  Yes if you get desperate you can summon the handtraps as materials for your combos, they're not just for tech options. Crossout is there at three bc oh boi you're like the beta dragon links where you're Special summoning for days to get to your key cards so nibiru is your biggest threat, Ash blossom is kinda of a hit if you open with dupe Drytrons but this deck can live through at least most hand traps. Droll and Lockbird will slow you down the most so if you get hit with that but no cross-out to respond then just do the weak ass Sycthe lock and pray your oppnent has no out to it next turn. Dark ruler no more is preferred over Droplet as you want to keep a card advantage and it's just a Going 2nd filler card for this deck. Side deck has backrow hate that can be tossed in if your you're dueling a trapbased deck.  There's a lot of whack and weird boards but this is mostly a for fun deck as it's end board is not insane as Prank kid's adventure or Swordsouls. But as another pile deck with Adventure_Token.exe package it makes it feel like this deck can do something with each oppening hand.  &nbsp;  <strong>Important Note:  </strong>If at any point you use Gamma Eltanin's effect you cannot go for Adventure Token plays that turn so choose which approach you play wisely as it will lock you out of the Adventure token package if you go for the megalith plays.  &nbsp;"
