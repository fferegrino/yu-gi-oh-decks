Ultimately, the goals of this deck are quite simple, domino effect into getting a combination of Dark Armed Dragon and Ananta/Vaskii utilizing some straightforward combo lines. Until you get a hand that can do that (which can be turn 1 a surprising amount of the time), utilize the big booty of Reptilianne Gardna and the multiple sources of stubborn interaction this deck gains access to in order to control your opponent's ability to fight back. Also, be aware that the destruction effect on Ananta is <strong>not optional</strong>, so make sure that you have a second card you're okay with popping on the field if you set her up on turn 1 or if your opponent's board is clear.</p><p>The sideboard is mainly put together for your Zombie matchup, as Zombie World can be a nightmare to deal with as it completely shuts off Ananta. Fortunately, you do have main deck outs to the pesky Field Spell, as Vaskii only cares about the stats of what you tribute (which Dandylion sent off of Snake Rain/D.D.R. achieves quite nicely), and due to the lack of spells/traps that stick around on your side you can run a bevy of main deck backrow hate <em>(Fun Tip: You can trigger your own Starlight Road using Heavy Storm if you wanna slam a Stardust Dragon on the field out of</em> <em>nowhere!</em>). The D.D. monsters help with things like early Mezukis and Pyramid Turtles, and Nobleman just makes any defensive deck a minimal issue.</p><p>Any tips on how to improve this deck are greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>"

The new support for the strategy enables 1-card combos with Schwarzchild Infinity Dragon which is effectively full combo since it enables a summon of a rank 8 monster (with a XYZ dragon lock) without using up your normal summon! This card is effectively at 12 copies in the deck with maxxed out copies of Seyfert, Seventh Ascension, and the new Schwarzchild Infinity and Seventh Tachyon cards! Not only that, the generic rank 8 ""Divine Golden Shadow Dragon Dragluxion"" adds any Tachyon or Galaxy card from deck on-summon! This enables Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon to pack 18 non-engine slots (21 if you include the Horus cards) making it capable of going 1st&nbsp;or second in Masterduel's cutthroat competitive ladder with handtraps/defensive staples!&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This insane consistency boost allows Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon to play to it's strengths, spamming its unique and insanely powerful countertrap ""Tachyon Transmigration"" and wielding ridiculously high attack stats (for ex.

I've heard most people talk about the Kashtira engine as the best option for a true one-card combo by going into Arsenal Falcon, making Romulus, and dumping Destrudo with Zephyros in rotation to make AFD and get into the new field spell. I think this avenue fails for a number of reasons, but most importantly:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. It uses your normal summon anyway for Kashtira Riseheart, so you are unable to use Man with the Mark as a starter if you go for the Fenrir 1-card combo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. If you get interrupted on your Arsenal Falcon, or your Romulus, or even your Fenrir, you're SOL. If you don't have Called By/Crossout and they negate your Falcon, you have no follow-up beyond hard drawing Treasures of the Kings--which, if you did that, why are we bothering with the convoluted Kashtira combo anyway?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously using Fenrir as a starter allows you to have a true 1-card combo--the material you start with gives you a line into Silhouhatte Rabbit without needing anything else in hand other than a discard to Ravine, but the inherent fragility and non-extensibility of this line makes me shy away from it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, by using a small Dragon Ravine package as a supplemental engine, we can achieve largely the same effect while also providing some much needed flexibility and resiliency to the main combo. Man with the Mark remains our primary starter, with Anubis and Small World as a way to search out. Iff they negate the Man with the Mark, and you have any of the five ways to get to Dragon Ravine (3x Remus, 2x Ravine), you can use Ravine to dump Destrudo and go into AFD using the Man with the Mark. This gameplan DOES still require you to have an extra card to set to trigger the Treasures of the Kings, but that can be solved with some clever deckbuilding to make sure you have enough settable cards to fulfill this requirement while maintaining a good core engine and non-engine base.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, having so much access to Dragon Ravine means, even without Man with the Mark, starting with Ravine and any non-Tuner normal summon means you can go into AFD and Apophis combo WITHOUT using Man with the Mark. This line is obviously more fragile--but it also means more hands are playable, even with a solid number of hand traps. Because of this, we need our hand traps to be non-Tuners--which means no ghost girls or Effect Veiler. We also need our hand traps to be ultra-impactful. This deck has a hard time going second, so we need our non-engine to be solid board breakers or game-ending hand traps. For that reason, we're playing Fuwalos, Droll, and Nibiru. In order to maintain a high number of Spells/Traps to set alongside our Treasures of the Kings, we're playing Impermanence and Book of Eclipse, as we need these to be useful going second but also fine to set on our own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Book of Eclipse slot could also be used for Forbidden Droplet instead. However, I default to Book for a few reasons:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. We're already so card hungry with Dragon Ravine as an extender and Small World as a searcher, that it can be difficult to even have enough material for Droplet to good work into an established board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Book of Eclipse can actually be used as an insulator against targeted negation when attempting to resolve Man with the Mark or AFD--which is a resiliency we sorely need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Book of Eclipse has synergy with the Trap Monster line-up. Pumping out our Trap Monsters to interrupt the opponent first and then following up with Book of Eclipse actually resets the Trap Monsters (as they have the text ""It's still a Trap"") to be used later. This is obviously win-more, but it means that, in an intense grind-game, it is not as much of a liability as it might otherwise be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the addition of Dragunity Remus and the sculpting of our hand trap lineup means Small World can bridge any of our handtraps into either Dragon Ravine (through Droll-&gt;Mulcharmy-&gt;Remus or Mulcharmy-&gt;Droll-&gt;Remus) or an Apophis Starter (Droll-&gt;Anubis-&gt;Man, Mulcharmy/Remus -&gt; Droll -&gt; Anubis, Nibiru -&gt; Anubis -&gt; Man) or even Serket if Treasures search is Ashed (Droll/Nibiru/Mulcharmy -&gt; Anubis/Man -&gt; Serket). That means, even though it takes a card, we can flex our non-engine lineup into starters or extenders as needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Apophis typical endboard is the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Silhouhatte Rabbit</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Divine Spirit of Apophis</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Statue of Anguish Pattern</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Apophis the Serpent</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. 2x Apophis the Swamp Deity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is around 5-6 pops and two mass omni-negates on the field. This is a suite of endboard interaction that is particularly potent in a format that relies on monsters either on the field or in banishment. Spot removal is at a premium, and this deck ends on basically all spot removal. This can be a problem against decks like Fire King that prefer to be destroyed, but it is possible to play around their destructions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, I'm very, very happy with list, and I invite you to try it out!</p>"

First up is the Lyrilusc WIND Winged Beast theme, an archetype dedicated to R1NK Xyz Monsters and attaching a lot of material to Lyrilusc &ndash; Assembled Nightingale. Between Lyrilusc &ndash; Bird Call, Lyrilusc &ndash; Cobalt Sparrow, Lyrilusc &ndash; Celestine Wagtail, and Lyrilusc &ndash; Recital Starling, this theme has all of the consistency-boosters one could hope for, as you grab the specific pairings of monsters needed for combos. Beyond the OTK combo of a multi-direct-attacking Assembled for game, the Lyrilusc also have some neat tricks like the full-board monster negate of Lyrilusc &ndash; Bird Strike and the spinning of Lyrilusc &ndash; Ensemblue Robin. But where this theme shines is its ability to easily merge two Winged Beast Xyz monsters into one with Lyrilusc &ndash; Bird Sanctuary, empowering them to take on the world&hellip; or eat it, if you&rsquo;re Epurrely Plump!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That brings us to our second theme, the Fairy Xyz archetype Purrely! The Purrely archetype uses two Level 1 monsters to faux-Xyz Summon out its R2NK Xyz Monsters, and once the R2NK amasses enough material, it can be upgraded to a R7NK boss. Do you see where I&rsquo;m going with this yet? If not, the goal of this hybrid is to combine Lyrilusc Level 1s and leftover Purrely or Purrelyly from your Quick-Play Spell activations to make Lyrilusc Xyz Monsters, then transfer the Lyrilusc and its associated Xyz Material to a Purrely R2NK (after Reprodocus turns it to Winged Beast of course), giving you everything you need to make a R7NK Purrely boss. No strings attached, no hoops or multiple Quick-Play Spells needed.
