This deck has been thoroughly tested against all current meta decks and with the exception of maybe drytron (because it's drytron) it can comfortably break boards and deliver victory.  So the deck historically struggled with damage output due to low atk monsters so it had to rely on searching desperado or cross-domination every turn to try and get over something big, now with Destroy Phoenix Enforcer we don't have that problem anymore  For the Musketeer half of the deck you want to be going second usually your looking for a Musketeer + 1 or more Spell/Trap that's why we run so many, the aim is to use Max to generate card advantage against an established board, you can be flexible wether you need the monsters for extra deck plays or support cards for your board.  So for Destiny hero's we are trading the usual celestial + dasher for fusion destiny and instead running malicious and denier because we have the space. Ideally you are hard drawing fusion destiny then dump mali and denier, summon DPE then use mali's effect summon the copy from deck then use denier from the gy to summon itself, reset the banished mlai, link for cross crusader then summon mali back again and turn those into dread decimator and bingo you have the big bodies you've been lacking.  The rest of your extra are flex spots really fill it with what you think is best for the situation but I find break sword and redoer are great for grind games, utopia is good if you've got spare monsters after you've broken a board and accesscode and zeroboros don't really need explaining.  A great little interaction if you've set up a board with a Musketeer and DPE if you've got fiendish deal active you can just keep targeting the Musketeer for DPE's pop and it fiendish means it can't be destroyed so you aren't loosing anything.  &nbsp;  I'm still working on the deck so may update the list as the meta changes, hopefully at some stage I'll get to a point where its beating drytron too."

Drytron is probably the best deck in the meta right now, and the hit to 1 Eva doesn't even make me blink. It just really easily puts bodies on the board and is full of consistency cards, and while that does leave it a little weak to Droll, it's an amazingly powerful deck. Consistency isn't everything, but it counts for a lot, and the deck also is amazing at putting up end boards, and pretty good at breaking boards too.  So, 3 Alpha, 3 Zeta, probably never going to change. Your main combo starters are also consistency cards, that's what the deck does. You really want access to these names, and I think 3 is just essential, since seeing one of these is technically better than searching them. 2 Gamma. Gamma is good, but remember, we essentially run 11 Gamma with all of the searching, or send it with Mu-Beta Fafnir. Probably the best name, in the main combos you usually send this with Mu Beta Fafnir to make a second Fafnir, for access to Utopic Draco Future after using the 4 Fafnir materials for ritual summoning. The fact that it just makes the first Fafnir is pretty insane too, but again, we can search out copies of this card with our consistency cards, so 2 is fine. Delta is just here for the name, it comes up, and so does it being a level 1 Drytron monster, so you need to run this. The draw is good, mind you, so long as you don't see Red-Eyes Fusion.  The next pile of cards are consistency cards. Fafnir doubles up as Drytron Nova and the ritual spell, Drytron Nova gives you access to Drytron names and bodies. We run 3 Nova and 1 Fafnir even though we could run 3 Fafnir and combo off more often, because in practice it makes the deck stronger against Droll, a common side deck card currently seeing some main deck play. 1 Foolish Burial. This gives you access to a lot of cards, including Drytron names and ritual monsters, as well as Zombie World through Necroworld Banshee. Lastly, we run 3 Cyber Emergency, it's Rota for Drytron monsters, and the effect when it's activation is negated is all plus, since we can ritual summon and summon Drytron monsters from the GY. All this GY stuff does leave us a little weak to GY hate in addition to Droll, but that's Yu-Gi-Oh! If your opponent has a million interruptions you try and make Dragoon, boom, problem ""solved"".  2 Ritual Spell. I dunno, the deck recycles the 1 copy really well, so you don't strictly need a second in almost all of your combos. However, Dragoon requires a pitch so there are a lot of games where that 1 card represents an extra negate, and there are some combos that only work if you have a second copy. It is also good for the grind game to be able to search out a second copy, and I think for all those reasons 2 is correct. You shouldn't ever need 3. 1 Eva as well, helps fill your hand with Fairies, mostly for Ultimateness, but it also represents 1 negate off of a hand trap in the face of DRNM and Droplets. You typically send this with Beatrice on your opponent's turn or add it with Benten.  So, for the Ritual package - 1 Beneten, because the card is at 1, but we're effectively running 5. The full 7 was nice for giving you access to Benten to combo off with hands that appear lackluster at first glance, but it also resulted in too many bricky games where your hand was lots of access to ritual cards and no Drytrons. In addition you never wanted to see copies 2 and 3 of Extra-Foolish, so running just 1 makes sense on multiple levels. For other rituals, Idaten is important to your main combo (Dragoon + Beatrice + Draco Future + Ultimateness) and is just a good backup target to search with Preparation of Rights. It's okay to see sometimes but mostly you should think of this as something like a brick, so 1 is all we need. I've added one Natasha, because stealing monsters is good. The deck might not always put up it's big end board, or it might not go first, and Natasha helps break boards and contributes to the grind game. I run 1 Ultimateness. The ultimate plan of this deck in this form is just to rely on Ultimateness for most of our interruptions, you must run this card.  For consistency cards with our rituals I'm on 3 Preparation of Rites and 1 Extra-Foolish. The first copy of Extra-Foolish is probably better than Prep, but Prep isn't once per turn and recycles the ritual spell, which represents an extra negate with Dragoon in a lot of combo situations. These are mostly just your 5 cards to access Benten, but they help pull combos together even if you see them with Benten, provided you see some Drytron names and have access to the ritual spell.  The Dragoon package is obvious. You'll make this in your end board a fair amount, and it is necessary as a backup plan for when you get negated into oblivion.  3 Diviner of the Herald. The card is basically a level 6 Manju with extra steps. It's a combo piece, it's a starter, it's your 1 Normal summon and it is searchable. 3 of these are mandatory, if you don't need to search it up your combos get even better.  For hand traps, 2 Ash, 1 Lancea, 3 Herald of Orange Light. Ash is both incredibly generic and useful in rogue matchups, reasonably effective in most meta matchups, and specifically useful against Virtual World, so I'm maining 2 over Lancea. I still think you have to main 1 Lancea, you can just easily search it out in the deck, and it is highly effective against a lot of the meta, including several rogue decks that are still highly played, plus worst case it is a fairy for Ultimateness. Herald of Orange Light is also good, as the card can often represent a Gamma-like protection for your combo, only unlike Gamma it doesn't require your board to be empty, plus you search this easily with Eva and it is a hand trap in a lot of hands. I think you just have to play 3 of these cards.  Extra deck is virtually unchanged, but I'm back on Fucho over Assembled Nightingale. I miss the extra 2 materials, but I like the added protection, and I'd run both if I had the space. It's basically a way to make Zeus, the combo pieces necessary to get Ultimateness + Utopic Draco Future + Dragoon (or low-end 2 of those monsters) Accesscode for a thing to make with Natasha, and the Fairy package, for comboing off and a spot of disruption."

Illusion Of Chaos and Magicians Salvation add consistency to the deck that it desperately needed. Timaeus, is the all new fusion spell we all wanted and needed. being a searchable Timaeus via Illusion Of Chaos and Soul Servant. Of course, The deck had to include the REF package after it escaped the banlist! The main plays of the deck are still building your board of DMC, Eternal Soul and Dragoon if possible with added control themed cards such as Crackdown, Infinite Impermanence, Ash Blossom and so on. Any of these types of cards are fantastic additions to the deck.  And yes! i do still Run Bond Betweeen Teacher And Student with Dark Burning Magic waiting in the rear. It is still a great surprise move that can catch your opponent off guard, however I do understand if you disagree with this fact. If needed it can be replaced by other cards to aid the consistency of the deck with cards such as Up-Start Goblin or even more control themed cards. Dark Renewal as well as Dark Magic Veil are still waiting in the Side-deck to help when I need the Extra Revival of your main monsters.  Ratios is a hot topic at the moment with Dark Magician, however I maintain that having DM, DMC and Eternal Soul all at 3 is not a bad thing. Yes dropping to 2 can help but over all they are your man combo pieces which you do want to see as quick as possible, not that they are the only plays the deck an do anymore. However, I can confirm that the time you drop any of these cards to less then 3 will be the one time you will want the Extra Copies. That being said, if i was to drop ratios, I would drop Dark Magician to 2 copies, this being because if you can use one to get to dragoon you can often use the other to get the DMTDK, and he also counts to being a Dark Magician on the field and GY"

Long story short: it didn't work. For me, at least. So I tried to focus on Dark Magician, but then struck another problem. I realized after a few test runs with a pure Dark Magician test deck that this guy is <strong><em>fast</em></strong>. Very fast. And that's not fun. So how do I make my deck a little bit more fun? A quick comparison of multiple Dark Magician deck profiles led me to conclude that one of the core reasons that contribute to the deck's speed is the <em>multiple copies</em> of those support cards he's so famous for. Almost none of them have any sort of limitation whatsoever, with the exception of one particular Fusion Monster who's currently limited in the OCG. Simply put, I just cut them all to one copy each. All in all, I'm gonna stick with this deck for the foreseeable future, especially since the new wave of support cards for Dark Magician is starting to make even <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> look not so busted. <blockquote><div><span>EDIT: I just realized YGOPro tagged this deck as a Burn deck, even though I used absolutely no cards that inflict burn damage... oh well.</span></div></blockquote> &nbsp;"

So we play Dragoon 2500 def for spellcaster, Destiny Phoenix 2500 atk for warrior, Albion 2500 atk for dragon (Albaz), and Sprind 2500 atk for machine (Speedroids).  &nbsp;"

These are just my preferences, but I'd love to hear other peoples' thoughts and suggestions for improving it.  &nbsp;  Gizmek Orochi  is your bread and butter. It banishes cards for summon or to destroy an opponent's monster, is level 8 for XYZ summons, and is easily recyclable over multiple turns.  Both Danger! monsters are standard level 8s for XYZs and are pretty much free activations from the hand. they also make good discard fodder to take out a card or two from your opponent's field.  Glife is your Golden Castle searcher and can double as a normal/special summon if you need to destroy backrow if you happen to banish all your copies of Hexe Trude.  Hexe Trude pops your opponent's cards, can attack multiple monsters, boosts your other monsters' attacks, and is also level 8.  Eater of Millions is pretty obvious as a non-targeting banish and tribute immune card.  Gren Maju just smashes monsters. He can get big fast, especially if you can open Desires and Orochi.  Pot of Desires is self-explanatory and Golden Castle helps banish cards, summons Hexe or Glife, and if your opponent isn't paying attention can destroy a monster or two while taking a nice chunk of life points.  Hand traps are a personal preference, but Dimension Shifter is your king. It will shut down most every deck for a turn.  And finally Super Poly. Most decks will have at least one target you can make with it (plus you can discard one of your Danger! cards), and some will have several. This is your ultimate ""turn the tables"" card.  Extra deck is mostly Super Poly targets, BLS for untargetable and indestructible to card effects, and a general Rank 8 package plus Numeron Dragon for OTKs after clearing out your opponent's field. The Super Poly targets can be exchanged as meta dictates or some of the less likely ones can be changed out for other rank 8s or generic links.  &nbsp;  You lose pretty hard to Lancea and a couple other floodgates, and Ash Blossom can mess with your potential if you don't have a couple ways to try to bait it in your opening hand.  &nbsp;  Any feedback is welcome. Please enjoy."

I Think the super poly (and super poly targets) add a Little bit more to the deck having a possibility do deal with high attack monsters and problematic cards (the true weakness of the deck).  Ties od the brethren can be an useful tool to put more bodies on board but going first might not be a Great card.  Overall the deck is quite fun to play and can deal with a not of different strategies.  &nbsp;

Also you want cards like sunrise for easy access to miracle fusion and for extra ATK for Hero's.  Cards like Adoration allow you to destroy monster easier. Elemental hero Dark neos is a negate, and Air neos allows for clutch victories. Neos fusion at needs to be at 3 so that neos fusions are easier to get out. Also, Elemental hero Shadow mist needs to be at 3 for the best consistency. The best card that can start combo's though is either. 1. elemental hero solid soldier allows you to play into either elemental hero stratos(to get Vision Hero Farris in Hand) or Elemental Hero Shadow Mist (for dark law). Or 2. if you already have Vision Hero Farris in hand+1 Hero card, you can discard 1 hero card from you hand and special summon him, so that you can get vision hero Increase. Then you can sacrifice your Farris for increase (due to its effect.) then using increase you can special summon 1 Vision Hero Vyon which allows you to send 1 Hero monster from your deck to the graveyard (the best option being either Destiny hero Malicious for the special summon, or Shadow Mist for the Free search (search for Elemental Hero liquid soldier if not already in hand.) After that you can link summon your wonder driver and then use vyons 2nd effect (which allows you to banish 1 hero monster from your GY and then add 1 polymerization to your hand. Then use it on liquid soldier and something else to fuse for Elemental Hero Absolute Zero. Then use liquid soldiers effect to draw 2 cards then discard 1 ( is you happen to have 1 Malicious in the deck and 1 in hand then discard Malicious for this effect.

Fresh from the 2021 Ancient Battles Megatins.,"Dinosaurs with hand traps usually do a great job being the anti-meta strategy. Dinos can set up a pretty fearsome board with negates and UCT staring your opponent down. Nothing better than a good old ""Face Down, A** Up!"" effect to ruin your opponent's Synchro, Xyz, Link, and other based strategies. Your general strategy for them is to summon UCT and ""stronk"" Link monsters as quickly as possible using cards such as Double Evolution Pill. With the easily splashable ""Crossout Designator"", your deck will most likely stand a chance against those of today's meta."

Of course it survived a bullet to the chest like Teddy Roosevelt ,"New video out now. Link below  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=kfKozPMmAdE&amp;t=1s"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=kfKozPMmAdE&amp;t=1s</a>  One way to end off the competitive Yu-Gi-Oh season is to half-ass a banlist, and put more effort into making excuses; another is to assassinate the decks that attempt to keep pace against their biggest cash cows. This is where the Prank-Kids came right into the clutches of that same company. A mold of 80s/90s tropes that was hushed because it doesn't print money for Konami *(according to them at least;* However despite ""Meow-Meow-Mu"" being at limited status, it is not the end of the world. What was starting fodder is still starting fodder with extra steps; but what killed the momentum was for ""Battle Butler"" having to pay his rent without having to worry about forking over his Lamborghini. However the fancy steak dinners will still be available at the expense of Prank-Kids not getting anymore foreseeable banlist hits.  Nothing really changed for Prank-Kids since it's miraculous Remote Duel YCS win back in July. Sure this time I ran with ""Daigusto Emeral"" over ""Abyss Dweller"" for monster recovery options when ""Prank-Kids Pranks"" is around (or isn't); but usually you could play any Rank-4 you want (or even Rank-2 if you don't want Toadally Awesome). Thunder Dragon Fusion was added to make ""Battle Butler"" while recovering pieces back to your deck; ""Infinite impermanence"" + ""Effect Veiler"" also had pretty significant results; and Parallel eXceed has proven to be a decent Utility for quick Rank-4's, or Link Summoning extension. ""Knightmare Phoenix/Unicorn"" are still great generic link options to go through in case SHTF or to go into ""Accesscode Talker"" for finishers. Also included is ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"", ""Contact ""C"", ""Forbidden Droplet"", and ""Evenly Matched"""

You have easy starters, lots of consistency, and an insane grind game, and you can run lots of hand traps. The hand trap thing is what I like about this deck - it reminds me a lot of Dogmatika, where you can run a billion hand traps to slow your opponent down to the grind game, where you have an advantage. It's a little more comboish than Dogmatika, but generally just puts up a couple interruptions on the board, relying more on the searchable Trap and hand traps that a giant board. It's weird in that your ""high end"" board is just Apollo, but you search the trap and maybe DD Crow, and that's all you need.  The line-up is really simple. We're running 3 Rescue Cat because it is the best starter in the deck, and very needed now that Tenki is at 1. We play 1 Tenki to search Fraktall. Then we're on full playsets of Tris. The reason for this is simple, Fraktall is a 1 card starter, Kitt and Keras is a 2 card starter combo, and the extra Tri name in Nervall helps cheat out those link monsters. If I were to cut down on any of them it would be Nervall, because the Kitt + Keras combo is really good and means more of your hands actually go places, but I like just maxxing out on all my Tri names. There simply aren't enough Tri-Brigade monsters to skip on any of them. I also think you have to run 3 Revolt. Yes, you can search this card, but I think you need 3 for your grind game, and also you actually do want to see this card in your opening hand. Lastly, I run 1 Foolish. Foolish Burial full combo. Okay, admittedly, it's the weakest of your starters, but you have few enough starts in the archetype that I think if you're running pure Tri you should run this card.  Half the deck is interruption. That's the real appeal of this deck to me, that you can afford to run so many hand traps. DD Crow makes the cut despite being a little weak because it is searchable in your combos. Ash, Imperm, Veiler, and Belle are very generic hand traps that do just enough in most matchups, and double up as being the most common hand traps to hit with Crossout. Gamma is good offensively and defensively in this deck, and the deck can easily cycle through cards putting these on the bottom if you don't use them. It's just a good high-impact going second card that also protects a lot of your combos going first. Crossout is Crossout, if you're already running a suite of the most common hand traps I think this is obligatory, though I do contend not every deck wants to run this. (Yet. Maxx ""C"" would change that, theoretically).  The extra deck is pretty simple. 2 Barren Blossom, this is a combo piece and a consistency card in the extra deck, and I think you need 2. 2 Bearbrumm, you really need to search out the trap - this does lock you into Tris for the rest of the turn, so keep that in mind, but just use this to make Apollo at the end of your combo, you'll be fine. 3 Shuraig - you'll make 2 of these before your second turn sometimes, and so a third comes in handy for follow-ups. 3 also improves your grind game in a lot of situations where you only make 1 turn 1. 1 Silver Sheller - this lets you fire off your Trap in response to Cosmic or Twin Twisters and still get the interruption out of Shuraig, and comes up in some of your combos, but you really don't need a second. Apollo is your main boss monster going first, and we've also got Unicorn - Accesscode for going second. 1 Omega and 1 Lambda. You barely make Lambda, but Omega comes in handy since we're using Gamma defensively. Lambda does come up so I think it is worth the slot. We've got 1 Double Dragon Lords, you cheat this out for basically free in a lot of your combos and it puts up an interruption. If you're confused, you summon this card using your Tri-Brigade effects, so its link requirements aren't relevant. 1 Almiraj comes up in some low-end combo plays, I think you need this just to be able to play sometimes.  For the side deck, I'm running an artifact package. Lancea seems good right now, and also it hurts our deck pretty badly, so being able to send it with Crossout also feels good. It feels good enough in meta matchups that running the 6 with Artifact Sanctum makes a lot of sense, especially since it doubles as a Scythe, meaning you can lock out multiple types of decks going first, pretty sweet. Cosmic and Red Reboot are here for Backrow, and DRNM and Droplets are here for going second against combo boards."

However, a comment was made on that deck by a guy named ""Shiqui"". So, using the suggestion he gave, I made this new deck with some of the cards he suggested. I only play YuGiOh with my friend, and we play the game a tad bit differently. We don't exactly follow the rules of links. We still use links, but we both agree that it's just a hassle, as both of us have a lot of extra deck monsters. However, I put 2 Link monsters in this deck in the hope that it could possibly be used in actual tournaments. Best of luck on your next duel!"
