This is a Blue-Eyes Trap-Control build with an extended discussion on deck-building theory and ,"No audacious claims here that this is 'the best, most consistent, least bricky Blue-Eyes deck ever'. Players would do right to view any claims like that with a lot of skepticism, especially if they lack documented success in competitive play. For my part, I have not competed with this deck in a tournament yet, though I plan to take it to locals while Skill Drain is still at x3--if for no other reason than to have fun playing Blue-Eyes again.  But the reason I've embraced this build at all is because of the success of other players who have taken similar builds--the Blue-Eyes Trap Control build--to locals and won. HaltessiaGaming (YouTube channel name) has won several OTS local tournaments playing this variant of Blue-Eyes, gradually over time moving towards a heavier fusion build. Credit to HaltessiaGaming, his YouTube deck profiles and combo videos go over the theory behind his deck-building strategy in great detail. Whether players take up the trap-control build or not, they're worth studying for competitive players because of how fearlessly they cast away long-held deck-building dogma around 'how you have to run Blue-Eyes'. Practice is the sole criterion of truth, and the fact that no other Blue-Eyes builds are seeing success--let alone topping--tournaments speaks for itself.  <strong>Dogma is Dead</strong>  I was skeptical of the Blue-Eyes control build for some time--mainly turned off by how fragile a strategy revolving around True Light seemed. But what really got my attention with HaltessiaGaming's build was that, originally, he played the vanilla Blue-Eyes White DragonÂ at x2 and the Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, which is treated as the vanilla on-field or in-grave, at x1.  That's basically heresy among Blue-Eyes players, who have feverishly insisted that the vanilla is played at x3 and the Alternative White Dragon at x2 (some die-hards insist on playing it at x3 but this is no longer widely accepted). Of course this is Blue-Eyes we're talking about so the x5-6 level-8 dragons--all of whom are considered 'Blue-Eyes White Dragon' on the field or in-grave, mind you--are joined with a host of other level-8 dragons. The high probability of opening with an unplayable hand necessitates running other cards like Trade-In at x3, which Blue-Eyes players have rationalized as a 'draw engine' (in fact, Trade-In mills the deck but only replaces itself and the level-8 monster discarded, making it a +0). ""It's called Brick-Eyes for a reason,"" says the old saying. Of course the deck bricks. It's loaded up with unnecessary monsters that certain players feel an attachment to including but rarely go live by themselves!  In my other deck profiles, I've talked in some detail about deck-building theory as it relates to Blue-Eyes and bricking. Blue-Eyes decks haven't had an issue searching their signature monsters or getting them out onto the field. The main issue is how overloaded these decks have been with extenders and boss monsters, who not only show up in opening hands in place of critical starters but, more importantly, take up valuable deck space that would normally go towards hand traps, board-breakers and other cards you would traditionally associate with 'going second'. Its consistency is problematic, sure, but even the boards it creates have tended to lack staying power into turn-2.  Worse still, traditional Blue-Eyes staples like Trade-In are absolutely devastating targets for an opponent to hit with Ash Blossom, blowing out 33-40% of a player's opening hand depending on whether they went first or second. A lot of the Blue-Eyes staples have had similar vulnerabilities, notably Melody of Awakening Dragon (played below), but the generic discard-1 cost of Melody is easier to fulfill and can often mitigate the damage of disruption (for example, by discarding either of the White Stones).  <strong>What did the Battle of Chaos support do for BEWD?</strong>  Thanks to the new support released in Battle of Chaos, a lot of the fundamental weaknesses associated with Blue-Eyes decks can be fixed. Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon has practically replaced Alternative as the main level-8 extender to get on the board with its powerful, non-targeting bounce effect, its field protection of other cards, and its outrageously simple summoning requirements. Jet Dragon is a boss monster that can easily function as a hand trap--its one drawback being its requirement that a Blue-Eyes White Dragon be in grave.  Similarly, Dictator of D. is a badly needed special summon that foolishes Blue-Eyes White Dragon from the deck for cost and can easily bring out any of the deck's big dragons from the grave. Its effect designating the target for opponent attacks comes up less frequently but can make an impact in shoring up an established board. It acts a lot like Magicians' Souls does for Dark Magician decks, albeit without the now-coveted draw power of the latter, and gave the deck another essential starter alongside Sage With Eyes of Blue, the White Stone of Ancients and--sometimes--the White Stone of Legend. I won't go into the specific combo lines here since others have outlined this and more in detail already, but Dictator + Sage practically gets the deck to full-combo.  Ultimate Fusion, too, is an outstanding extender that really ties a tighter fusion build together with the trap-control variant. When using Blue-Eyes White Dragons from the field, it pops face-up cards on your opponent's field. More importantly, though, it recycles its fusion materials by shuffling them back into the deck. This singular function enables Blue-Eyes decks to play fewer level-8 bricks since it keeps replenishing search and summon targets for cards like Dictator of D., the White Stone of Ancients and Melody of Awakening Dragon to grab. It's also a quick-play, allowing it to synergize exceedingly well with traps like True Light (which can also search and set Ultimate Fusion).  Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon, a two-year old card, has finally found its moment too. It's able to search and add Jet Dragon to hand during the End Phrase when summoned off the White Stone of Ancients and serves as a level-8 body for Formula Synchron to make Baronne de Fleur off Halqifibrax's second effect. Polymerization at x1 helps potentially get a Blue-Eyes from hand to grave without recycling it back into the deck, but Abyss Dragon also searches it to net a +1 on summon--provided a BEWD is in the graveyard already. But equally significant, in-grave, players can banish Abyss Dragon to give their dragons a +1000 ATK boost, allowing two Blue-Eyes White Dragons and/or Jet Dragon to OTK an opponent. Obviously the card has skyrocketed in price, and while it's certainly optimal, it's also not necessary. Neither of HaltessiaGaming's two builds, for instance, used Abyss Dragon.  <strong>Blue-Eyes Trap House &amp; Skill Drain</strong>  Konami's decision to return Skill Drain to x3 had major implications for the format. Eldlich decks saw an immediate boost from the infamous continuous trap's return to unlimited play. But as HaltessiaGaming's deck profile and theory discussions have pointed out, Blue-Eyes decks can benefit immensely from Skill Drain too. Even when it was limited to x1, most Blue-Eyes decks played Skill Drain. The reasons are clear: Most of the monster effects that summon Blue-Eyes White Dragon and its counterparts resolve off the field, allowing the deck's core beatdown strategy to play around the otherwise devastating floodgate. Most Blue-Eyes monsters are at 3000 ATK or more, effects aside, making them formidable in matchups with decks that require an elaborate choreography of monster effects to climb into big extra deck monsters. Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon, the new fusion monster released in Battle of Chaos, is also unaffected by trap cards, meaning that if the Tyrant Dragon is already on the field when Skill Drain resolves, its effects are not negated.  But Skill Drain isn't the only advantage Blue-Eyes has in this format. With so many decks using Artifact Scythe to restrict use of the extra deck, Blue-Eyes trap-control builds can play around another devastating floodgate. With the amount of on-field protection offered by main deck cards like True Light and Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon, players can maintain and even win with a board without relying on the extra-deck.  These are just features of the format. Some obnoxious Blue-Eyes dogmatists have flippantly dismissed the trap-control build for relying on Skill Drain x3 to win, arguing that without the trap, the deck couldn't win. Sure. That's true. But that's exactly the nature of any format. The restriction or un-restriction of certain cards changes the lineup of decks that can perform well or poor. What works in one format won't necessarily work in another format, owing in part to a particular deck's strengths and weaknesses. Blue-Eyes decks have a lot of weaknesses, even now, but this is a format that also showcases its potential strengths. Not only is there nothing wrong with playing to those strengths in the format; it's a necessity for competitive-minded players looking to bring out this iconic creature of destruction.  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>  Blue-Eyes probably isn't a viable strategy beyond the local level, even with the new support. The deck still has consistency issues, albeit much fewer than previous eras, and there's a lower power ceiling for the deck in general. Some of this is mitigated by playing more hand traps and real traps, but other than making Baronne de Fleur via Halqifibrax, you're not able to throw many negates on-board. With that in mind, the trap-control variant plays a longer game than many Blue-Eyes players are familiar with--a long game that makes liberal use of True Light to keep pace. That brings obvious vulnerabilities too. And while I'm convinced that playing 2x BEWD, 1x Alternative White Dragon is a better ratio for consistency in general--you want to be able to play your opening hand, after all--occasionally you run into the issue of not being able to activate certain effects without a BEWD on-field or in-grave. Cards like Foolish Burial, Dragon Shrine and obviously Dictator of D. tremendously help with this.  In closing though, I appreciate those players who take a look at new support and aren't afraid to roll back existing deck-building dogma. They're seeing some success--the most Blue-Eyes decks have seen in at least a year--and that's worth taking note. Let me know your thoughts in the comments.  Good luck and have fun, comrades."

The decks still have that old school yugioh feel to them. Card advantage is key and you always try to play around staples like Heavy Storm and Mirror Force, giving it that chess feel to it. Yet it feels somewhat modern in that decks are capable of being very aggressive and generating advantage on the spot. If you're not careful your opponent can easily push for game or create a game state that's hard to out with just one or two cards.</span>  <span>While every format has its own meta, with some deck being better than others, I've tried a variety of decks and have yet to see one that feels straight up bad. And I've played Brainwash Turbo so that really says a lot! (I'll get to that one at a later date) There are a lot of decks to play and have fun with.</span>  <span>Sadly, most people don't commit their time to writing decklists for a 12 year old format (shockers, I know). Also there's edisonformat[dot]com, a website for Edison decks, tournaments, rules and cardpool. However when it comes to creating and sharing decks no website beats ygoprodeck so I decided to start uploading my Edison decks here in hope to inspire people to create and share decklists of their own.</span>  <span>As of now the deck's I have created are all heavily inspired (or in some cases almost completely copy and pasted. What, am I not supposed to play Mirror Force and co.?) by decks found on edisonformat[dot]com so I'll try linking the original deck/deck that served as a basis for my decks here, too.</span>  <span>With that being said, let's get into the deck that first got me into Edison: <span>Flamvell Synchro Assault Mode</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strategy</span>  <span>This idea is to destroy monsters by battle using </span><span><a data-name=""Flamvell Firedog"">Flamvell Firedog</a></span><span> to then summon <span><a data-name=""Flamvell Magician"">Flamvell Magician</a></span>, turning Firedog into a 1-card Synchro 8. In most cases you'll go into <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></span> but this deck is on a large Synchro Toolbox, allowing for a variety of Synchro plays. Once you have your Flamvells in rotation, <span><a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a></span> allows for immediate advantage, resulting in <em>at least</em> a Synchro 8.</span>  <span>The Assault Mode engine gives you access to both a 1900 ATK beater as well as consistent access to <span><a data-name=""Assault Mode Activate"">Assault Mode Activate</a></span> thanks to <span><a data-name=""Assault Beast"">Assault Beast</a></span>. Once you've summoned Stardust Dragon you can tribute it for <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode"">Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</a></span>. This card is decent by modern standard, meaning it's absolutely broken by 2010's. It's your classic negate everything kind of omni-negate. But that wouldn't be modern enough now, would it. So obviously, in good old 2022 fashion this card also floats. If your opponent manages to out it you get to summon a Stardust Dragon from your GY.</span>  <span>The Flamvell engines is pretty good by itself but getting to Firedog is key. The Gravekeeper engine allows to keep on pressuring your opponent without committing to too many staples to even out the board state. Either wall up with two <span><a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Spy"">Gravekeeper's Spies</a></span> or use <span><a data-name=""Gravekeeper's Descendant"">Gravekeeper's Descendant</a></span> for removal.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Cards and Engines</span>  <span>I've already talked about the Flamvell engine, consisting of 3 of each Flamvell Firedog, Flamvell Magician and Rekindling</span>  <span>The Assault Mode engine consists of the 3 Assault Beasts and one copy of each Assault Mode Activate and Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode. Assault Beast is still a good beater at worst.</span>  <span>Since this deck is a Synchro Toolbox deck it runs <span><a data-name=""Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind"">Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a></span> for Synchro 6 and 7 plays. Plague can also be used to put Stardust Dragon/Assault mode on top of your deck the turn you want to summon it, since Assault Mode Activate cannot Special Summon from hand.</span>  <span>Rekindling is an unsearchable power card so <span><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></span> helps accessing it consistently.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</a></span> can't search your Flamvell engine nor can it search Assault Beast but it can search cards for almost every game state. I can add Spy to stall, <span><a data-name=""Sniper Hunter"">Sniper Hunter</a></span> for removal and either a level 2, 3 or 4 Tuner.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Credits to www[dot]edisonformat[dot]com/decks/rogue-decks-gravekeeper-flamvell</span>"

I will go over some of the combos that can be done with this deck. The extra deck was cut down to 13 to combat DD Dynamite bots in Master Duel but if you arent as worried about that, you can add standard staples such as zeus, bagooska, tornado dragon, etc. The main downside of this deck is its cost (in master duel) the majority of the cards are URs/SRs so there are a lot of expensive cards. The packs you'll wanna target are champions of hope and onomatopair-up (and the recontract universe structure deck for astraltopia) <h3>Full Combo:</h3> Starting Board: Three (unique) onomat monsters  Utopic Onomat + Dodododwarf -&gt; Utopic Sage + Ascended Sage + Utopic Onomat + Dodododwarf (returned via effects, first utopic, then dodododwarf)  Utopic Onomat + Dodododwarf + Zubababancho -&gt; Primathmech + Astraltopia (summoned via 3 card effect)  &nbsp;  Alternate Start: Utopic Onomat + Zubababancho + both ZS monsters  Utopic Onomat + Ascended/Armed Sage -&gt; Utopic Sage + Ascended/Armed Sage + Utopic Onomat (returned via effects)  Utopic Onomat + Zubababancho + Ascended Sage -&gt; Primathmech + Astraltopia (summoned via 3 card effect)  &nbsp;  Rest of Combo:  Primath + Utopic Sage -&gt; Utopic Future -&gt; Utopic Draco Future  Astraltopia + Discard -&gt; Zexal Construction  Astraltopia + Ascended Sage -&gt; Utopia Double -&gt; Utopia + Double or Nothing  Zexal Construction + Double or Nothing -&gt; Phantom Knights Rank-Up-Magic  Utopia -&gt; Utopia Prime -&gt; 4 material Utopia Dragonar  4 material Utopia Dragonar -&gt; 2 material Utopia Dragonar + 1 material Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray  1 material Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray -&gt; Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray w/ Equipped Pegasus  Set Phantom Knights Rank-Up-Magic and pass turn (set activity queue from auto to on if in master duel so you get earliest chance to activate dragonar)  Opponent's Turn:  2 material Utopia Dragonar -&gt; 0 material Utopia Dragonar + 0 material (important for rank-up-magic) Diablosis  Diablosis + Rank-Up-Magic -&gt; Kali Yuga w/ Full Board Negation for turn (persists through removal, and negates your board too)  &nbsp;  Final Board: Utopic Drago Future w/ monster negate and steal (if on board), Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray w/ two monster negates (on board), Dragonar w/attack negation quick effect, and Kali Yuga with (both sides) spell &amp; trap removal  &nbsp;  Potential Modifications:  If you draw the phantom knights rank-up magic/zexal construction, or astraltopia, you can skip primath and instead use two material to summon gagaga magician (which can be used to summon utopia-&gt;C39 Utopia Ray-&gt;Utopia Lightning if you choose to add them to your deck) as the second material for utopic future  If you draw double or nothing, skip utopia double  If you draw pegasus, use zexal construction to replace it in the deck instead of double or nothing  &nbsp; <h3>Partial Combos:</h3> PC1: If the best you can start with is something like Utopic Onomat, Zubaba, and one ZS monster (or any other setup where cant get 4 material on the board after utopic sage), you can skip the utopic draco future summon and just go for dragonar alone. In this case, you will summon hope harbinger instead of diablosis on your opponent's turn for a single spell negation.  PC2: Worst Case senario that you can still get a combo off is when you can only summon two monsters to the board. This usually happens when youre going second and need to use most of your hand to negate the opponent's monsters through effects such as droplet. In this case, just go utopia double-&gt;utopia + double or nothing. Certainly not as powerful as the previous combos, but if your opponent has an attack position monster with 2k or less attack (or 4k if one of the two monsters you got out was armed sage, allowing you to get asura strike) you can still end the game in that turn if you negate your own attack and then activate double or nothing  There are likely other partial combos i missed but most of them are likely just going to be bits of the full combo, so go out there and experiment and find the combos you prefer."

So I got to thinking, how can i mash these two concepts together into one deck? well here it is, the fruits of my tomfoolery have led me into a slippery slope of jank madness. If you want a quick description of the deck I have presented to you here, it would be that this deck is literally just Infernoble Knight, but without the Infernoble Knights  Unlike the ""PK but it's a Fusion Deck"" counterpart to this list (which you can find here <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/phantom-knights-but-its-a-fusion-deck-now/"">https://ygoprodeck.com/phantom-knights-but-its-a-fusion-deck-now/</a>), this deck is leagues more complicated when it comes to combos. So let me show you what this deck is supposed to do.  The key cards for most of your combos are as follows: Isolde, Halqifibrax, Auroradon. (kinda like Infernobles)  &nbsp;  Most combos go as follows: <ol>  	<li>get 2 warriors on board to get <a data-name=""Isolde"">Isolde</a>, anything will do</li>  	<li>use Isolde's second effect to get your tuner of choice (I chose Comrade Swordsman of Landstar cuz it's funny)</li>  	<li>use Isolde and tuner of choice to make <a data-name=""Halqifibrax"">Halqifibrax</a> and use the effect to get <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a></li>  	<li>use Halq and 001 to make <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon</a> and use his effect to get 3 tokens, triggering 001 to special from grave.</li>  	<li>use 001 and 1 token to make <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a></li>  	<li>use Auroradon's effect to special <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing"">Mecha Phantom Beast Coltwing</a> from deck by removing the other 2 tokens</li>  	<li>use Coltwing's effect to get 2 tokens, triggering 001 again</li>  	<li>use Coltwing, 001, and 1 token to make <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a> (coltwing is level 6 because of his effect)</li> </ol> End Board Results: Auroradon, Herald (omni negate), Baronne (2nd omni negate) and a spare token.  It's also important to know that the combo listed above is entirely possible after making Bardiche, which means you can stack a <a data-name=""fog blade"">fog blade</a> or two if you want to make the combo longer"

The two ""best"" decks of the Edison format are arguably Diva HERO and Vayu Turbo, yet neither of them was played back in April 2010. The decks played back then weren't bad. Many of them, like Jeff Jones' 1st place Dandywarrior Quickdraw, are still viable today. However, after spending so much time with a specific format people found new decks and strategies. One of them is <span>Diva HERO</span>.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strategy</span>  <span>Diva HERO decks constantly try to put pressure on your opponent, thanks to almost every card generating advantage. You have <span><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a></span> that can search you another monster to keep the card advantage going. <span><a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a></span> not only provides a body for free but makes summoning <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></span> laughably easy. </span>  <span>Pressuring your opponent with Synchros and impactful main deck monsters like <span><a data-name=""Caius the Shadow Monarch"">Caius the Shadow Monarch</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a></span> is pretty good on its own but what makes this deck shine is it's capability to completely abuse one of the only few generic HERO Fusion monsters that were released back in 2010: <span><a data-name=""Elemental HERO Absolute Zero"">Elemental HERO Absolute Zero</a></span>. This card is very difficult to out and you can potentially summon more than one a turn.</span>  <span>With every card generating you advantage and keeping on the pressure you'll often find yourself in an advantageous game state during which you can then push for lethal with Absolute Zero, Stardust Dragon, DAD, etc.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Cards and Engines</span>  <span>For the HERO half of the deck you're obviously on the aforementioned Stratos and two Malicious. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Diamond Dude,""><span>Destiny HERO - Diamond Dude</span>,</a> who despite its low ATK stat and inconsistent effect still proves to be quite threatening since its effect can be very strong if it resolves and worst case he'll get you closer and closer even to your powerful spells even if its effect misses. If you have Caius or a Malicious in hand and don't mind commiting your normal summon to him you can also search <span><a data-name=""Evil HERO Infernal Prodigy"">Evil HERO Infernal Prodigy</a></span>. It's a free Special Summon which makes for great tribute fodder. If you tribute it for Malicious you'll even get a draw during the End Phase.</span>  <span><span><a data-name=""Miracle Fusion"">Miracle Fusion</a></span>, although technically part of the HERO package, deserves it's seperate mention. It summons Absolute Zero by banishing materials in the GY. Nothing's easier than putting a few monsters in the GY in a format in which games take longer than a single turn. You play a large amount of WATER and HERO monsters and will barely ever find yourself out of luck.</span>  <span>Thanks to cards like Malicious and Miracle Fusion it's very easy to control the number of DARKs in your GY. That means that you can easily set up a Dark Armed Dragon even if you draw into him late into the game.</span>  <span>Now onto the Diva engine. The engine consists of a playset of <span><a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a></span> and a <span><a data-name=""Spined Gillman"">Spined Gillman</a></span> as the target. Don't forget that Diva can summon itself to link climb into a Synchro 8 with just another level 4 monster. I'll include <span><a data-name=""Treeborn Frog"">Treeborn Frog</a></span> and two <span><a data-name=""Snowman Eater"">Snowman Eater</a></span> here since they are still WATER monsters that provide advantage and are used as material for Absolute Zero afterwards, even though they're not searchable by Diva.</span>  <span>Last but not least I quickly want to mention <span><a data-name=""Future Fusion"">Future Fusion</a></span>. Pre-errata this card sends the materials to the GY when it resolves. This allows to mill both Treeborn Frog and Malicious and sets up your GY for Miracle Fusion, too. Fantastic.</span>  &nbsp;  General credits to www[dot]edisonformat[dot]com/decks/category/diva-heroes"

NR is a Master Duel Festival format with only N and R rarity cards. I've been testing this list for two weeks, and I think ","Welcome to this Marincess NR deck profile. NR is a Master Duel Festival format with only N and R rarity cards. I've been testing this list for two weeks, and I think I've came up with a solid and fun to play list. Marincess Sea Horse is the most important card in this deck, as it allows us to combo easily. Tin Goldfish is very useful in this recipe because it allows us to summon from hand any of the other LV4 we carry. Mermail Abysspike is an awesome card, as it allows us to search for Marincess Sea Horse when needed. Silent Angler is a good extender, but can be difficult to use in the first games due to the restriction it sets after being special summoned.  Tenyi Spirit - Shthana should always be special summoned first if it is in hand on our first turn. Marincess Basilalima isn't as good as I'd like, but we run it because we can Link 1 summon with it and it is a LV4 that can be summoned from hand by Tin Goldfish. Silent Sea Nettle is a very good water extender that allows us to recycle cards from both Main Deck and Extra Deck. Both Magical Mallet and Moray of Greed give us a lot of draw power, allowing us to risk sometimes unimportant cards to get the extender we need. Forbidden Chalice is a staple in this format. We also use Paleozoic Dinomischus and Marincess Wave to disrupt.  When it's not possible to summon both Marincess Blue Slug and Marincess Sea Angel in the same turn, opt for Marincess Sea Angel and prioritise getting Marincess Battle Ocean.  One of the basic non-standard combos in other Marincess variants that you're going to see a lot here is as follows: <ul>  	<li>Normal summon Mermail Abysspike, discard 1 water monster, search for Marincess Sea Horse.</li> </ul> You need an extender here, Tin Goldfish before Mermail Abysspike, Tenyi Spirit - Shthana before anything else, or an extender like Silent Sea Nettle now. <ul>  	<li>Special summon Silent Sea Nettle.</li>  	<li>Link 2 with Mermail Abysspike and Silent Sea Nettle. Link summon Marincess Crystal Heart.</li>  	<li>Special summon Marincess Sea Horse to a zone Marincess Crystal Heart points to.</li>  	<li>Link 1 with Marincess Sea Horse. Link summon Marincess Sea Angel and use Marincess Sea Angel's effect to search for Marincess Battle Ocean.</li>  	<li>Activate Marincess Battle Ocean.</li>  	<li>Link 3 with Marincess Crystal Heart and Marincess Sea Angel. Link summon Marincess Marbled Rock and use Marincess Battle Ocean's effect.</li> </ul> Now we have Marincess Battle Rock in the Extra Monster Zone with protection, with two different Marincess Links equipped and an attack above 3000.  That's a basic combo without the best cards, you can do it from many starters and sometimes get Marincess Blue Slug and equip it as well, Marincess Battle Rock achieving an attack of 4500.  Put Forbidden Chalice, Paleozoic Dinomischus and Marincess Wave to good use, don't be too greedy and use them when they would do the most damage to your opponent.  Don't worry too much if they only destroy Marincess Battle Ocean, you can recover it with Marincess Marbled Rock's effect and activate it again. Your Marincess Marbled Rock will gain its corresponding attack bonus and regain its protection against opponent's card effects.  Feel free to customize this list to your liking."

It's one of those old archetypes that does not really receive much direct support over time, until lately that the Labrynth cards got announced in which they actually did get some.</span>  <span><strong>The main deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span>â¢ The Chess Archfiends (x3 <a data-name=""Shadowknight Archfiend"">Shadowknight</a>, x2 <a data-name=""Terrorking Archfiend"">Terrorking </a>&amp; <a data-name=""Desrook Archfiend"">Desrook</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Infernalqueen Archfiend"">Infernalqueen</a>, <a data-name=""Darkbishop Archfiend"">Darkbishop</a>, <a data-name=""Vilepawn Archfiend"">Vilepawn</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Imprisoned Queen Archfiend"">Imprisoned Queen</a>) - <span>These are your main beaters, and also your main defenders. They all have a mandatory stipulation that requires its controller to pay a certain amount of LP during the Standby Phase in order for them to stay on the field. These are their respective effects:</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Shadowknight Archfiend"">Shadowknight </a>- <span>A WIND Fiend monster with 2000 ATK, but all battle damage it inflicts to your opponent is halved. Its targeting protection requires a roll of 3 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Desrook Archfiend"">Desrook </a>- <span>A LIGHT Fiend monster with 1800 DEF, that has an effect that can be used to send it to the GY when a ""Terrorking Archfiend"" you control is destroyed, and Special Summon the said monster. Its targeting protection requires a roll of 3 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Vilepawn Archfiend"">Vilepawn </a>- <span>An EARTH Fiend monster that prevents your opponent from attacking other monsters, except ""Vilepawn Archfiend"", which can be used to dupe lock your opponent. Its targeting protection requires a roll of 3 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Terrorking Archfiend"">Terrorking </a>- <span>A DARK Fiend monster with 2000 ATK that negates the effects of monsters it destroys by battle. Its targeting protection requires a roll of either 2 or 5 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Infernalqueen Archfiend"">Infernalqueen </a>- <span>A FIRE Fiend monster that has an effect that boosts an ""Archfiend""'s monster's ATK by 1000 during the Standby Phase, until the End Phase. Its targeting protection requires a roll of either 2 or 5 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Darkbishop Archfiend"">Darkbishop </a>- <span>A WATER Fiend monster that does not have a unique effect, but its targeting protection requires a roll of either 1, 3, or 6 to negate it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Imprisoned Queen Archfiend"">Imprisoned Queen </a>- <span>A Level 8 DARK Fiend monster that has an effect that boosts an ""Archfiend""'s monster's ATK during only your Standby Phase, until the End Phase, although it requires you to both have a face-up ""<a data-name=""Pandemonium"">Pandemonium</a>"" and it to be in the GY.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>There is also <a data-name=""Skull Archfiend of Lightning"">Skull Archfiend of Lightning</a>, a <a data-name=""Summoned Skull"">Summoned Skull</a> retrain that is also an honorary Chess Archfiend, since it also has a targeting protection that requires a roll of either 1, 3, or 6 to negate an opponent's card effect that specifically targets itself, and destroy that card.</span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Archfiend General"">Archfiend General</a>, <a data-name=""Archfiend Commander"">Archfiend Commander</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Archfiend Cavalry"">Archfiend Cavalry</a> - <span>Your classic combo usually involves pitching General to search for Pandemonium and activate it, Normal Summon Cavalry, Special Summon Commander, then mandatory destroy Cavalry. This will trigger two things, both your Pandemonium to search and your Cavalry to Special Summon itself. Do keep in mind that for Cavalry to trigger its Special Summon effect, you'd need to have at least 1 more ""Archfiend"" monster in the GY. Playing more copies of either of the three is fine.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror"">Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror</a> - <span>Your boss monster. A Level 8 DARK Fiend monster that has an effect that enables it to be Normal Summoned without Tributing at a cost of halving its ATK and DEF, and if it was summoned this way, it is destroyed during the End Phase. It also has a targeting removal effect that banishes an ""Archfiend"" card from your hand or GY to destroy a card on the field.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Trance Archfiend"">Trance Archfiend</a> - <span>The one of, in which you'd usually play more copies of in a regular build since it allows you to recover your banished ""Archfiend"" cards for the purposes of Archfiend Emperor's effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>Spells</strong></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Brain Control"">Brain Control</a> - <span>Semi-limited in the N/R rarity only format. Adds more pressure and helps you get rid of problematic monsters, provided they can be targeted.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a> - <span>Back row removal. This could also be <a data-name=""Nobleman of Extermination"">Nobleman of Extermination</a>.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> - <span>Also another way of dealing with high ATK monsters, so long as they can be targeted. Could literally be any card of your choice.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Archfiend Staff of Despair"">Archfiend Staff of Despair</a> - <span>Another way of you dealing with high ATK monsters as well, and can recur itself back to the hand at a cost of 1000 LP. You could choose whether to play this card or not, usually the latter in favor of another copy of the next card.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Falling Down"">Falling Down</a> - <span>A <a data-name=""Snatch Steal"">Snatch Steal</a>, but costs you LP instead of healing your opponent, and also destroys itself if you do not control another ""Archfiend"" card but hey, a nerfed Snatch Steal is still a Snatch Steal.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Pandemonium"">Pandemonium</a> - <span>The reason why you're still not dead despite all that maintenance cost, because it makes it so that neither player has to pay LP during the Standby Phase for the effect of ""Archfiend"" monsters. It also allows you to search an ""Archfiend"" monster with a different Level upon the destruction of one.</span></span>  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Archfiend's Roar"">Archfiend's Roar</a> - <span>It's <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>, but it requires you to pay LP and it destroys that monster during the End Phase. Your best target for this usually is Archfiend Cavalry, at least in this list. Some people only play 2 of these, which is understandable and completely fine.</span></span>  <span>â¢ <a data-name=""Call of the Archfiend"">Call of the Archfiend</a> - <span>It's also <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>, but only for Level 5 or higher Fiend monsters and requires you to discard a Fiend monster specifically as a cost. Some people only play 1 of this since it requires set up, but I like the added security in case my opponent outs the first one.</span></span>  <span><strong>Extra Deck</strong></span>  <span>None, you absolutely could play this deck by itself and it'll probably work itself out just fine, but in a full power build, you'll usually either run <a data-name=""Archfiend's Manifestation"">Archfiend's Manifestation</a>, <a data-name=""Archfiend's Call"">Archfiend's Call</a>, and <a data-name=""Archfiend's Ascent"">Archfiend's Ascent</a> and sometimes <a data-name=""Archfiend's Awakening"">Archfiend's Awakening</a> too, and a copy or two of <a data-name=""Masterking Archfiend"">Masterking Archfiend</a>, with either <a data-name=""Pot of Prosperity"">Pot of Prosperity</a>, <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, or <a data-name=""Celestial Observatory"">Celestial Observatory</a> since you run a plenty of Level 6 monsters, for consistency. You could splash in some <a data-name=""Dogmatika Punishment"">Dogmatika Punishment</a>s and high ATK targets as well, that'd be acceptable too.</span>  <span><strong>Final thoughts</strong></span>  <span>This deck performed better than the 2 other decks that I'm still currently testing lately for the N/R rarity only event, I'll give it that, but not having access to both <a data-name=""Archfiend Heiress"">Archfiend Heiress</a> and <a data-name=""Archfiend Empress"">Archfiend Empress</a> really hurts, since it could've definitely been faster with the addition of the said cards and <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a> as well. Not having access to high impact staples and floodgate really hurts too, since the main deck monsters usually aren't enough by just themselves. Overall, It's fine, but is being carried by the staples even more due to the lack of access to the high rarity support. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

Main strategy is the good ol' Rank 5 into Nova and Infinity, for the omni negate and monster absorbtion, by either luckily drawing Core, Nashe or Hertz + Duplication, or Galaxy Soldier Shenanigans, using Nashe to revive a regular Cyber Dragons...  Having a Cyber Dragon on the field (or ready to be summoned) + Kaiju = Remove anything from the board by summoning Fortress Dragon.  Megafleet does the same but without the Kaiju, you need the opponent's monster to be on the extra zone tho.  Zeus is there a bit just because I have him, never really used it, but could be useful I guess.  Almiraj sends Hertz to the graveyard if you have nothing else.  If you manage to summon Rampage and Sieger you can potentially OTK very easily, Rampage can even win you the game by himself if there's no monsters on the opponent's field and he's at 6300LP or less.  To link climb from Hiita to Accesscode, you'd need to have summoned almiraj at some point and have him on the graveyard, then summon Hiita, so normal summon an Ash Blossom or, link her away with something and then you want your opponent to have another Ash on the GY, (or another fire monster) to revive it when you summon Hiita, then link them away to summon Transcode Talker, and use Transcode's effect to revive Almiraj, and then finally Accesscode, made from a link 3, so 5300ATK.  I haven't really used Eternity, but it is really hard to remove, as long as you have some other fusion machine monster on the GY, and that's easy to do with megafleet and fortress dragons, Eternity will be untargetable and inmune to all effects, so it can only be killed by battle or by dropping a Kaiju on it.  &nbsp;"

Sometimes you have to settle for trading a <span><a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a></span> for a potentially bigger threat or just to wall up.</span>  <span>You'll be trying to stall your opponent with cards like <span><a data-name=""Cyber Valley"">Cyber Valley</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Battle Fader"">Battle Fader</a></span> (who's great tribute fodder for <span><a data-name=""Nightmare Archfiends"">Nightmare Archfiends</a></span>), <span><a data-name=""Compulsory Evacuation Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Fiendish Chain"">Fiendish Chain</a></span>.</span>  <span>Do keep in mind your opponent's life total.

All your beatsticks are summoned to your opponent's side of the field and with these two cards you can return them to your control. While Remove Brainwashing seems better than Owner's Seal since it doesn't apply it's effect at a singular moment like the latter, it is easier for your opponent to remove it than it is to negate the activation of Owner's Seal so keep that in mind when searching either with <span><a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a></span>.</span>  <span>I've already talked about Lava Golem, the card you're probably the most familiar with anyways. Besides it there's our honorary Knightmare and nightmare for many who've been around when he was still legal: <span><a data-name=""Grinder Golem"">Grinder Golem</a></span>. He summons himself while giving you two token, which can be used as tribute fodder for Nightmare Archfiends or <span><a data-name=""Reptilianne Vaskii"">Reptilianne Vaskii</a></span>. <span><a data-name=""Volcanic Queen"">Volcanic Queen</a></span> has less attack than Lava Golem but you can't always tribute 2 monsters and you can send another monster after missing lethal to deal another 1000 damage with her effect.Â </span>  <span>Nightmare Archfiends is like Ojama Trio on steroids. Requires a monster/token on your side of the field but has a huge payoff if you manage to take back control. That's a total of 6000 ATK points.</span>  <span>While Cyber Valley helps drawing into your combo pieces while stalling the game Battle Fader has surprising synergy with the deck as some cards require you to have a monster/0 ATK monster on the field.</span>  <span>2 of each</span> <span><a data-name=""Magic Planter"">Magic Planter</a></span><span>, Upstart Gobling and Gold Sarcophagus help getting to your win con.</span>  <span>Backrow is omni-present in older formats so this deck is on a lot of backrow removal to ensure you are OTK'ing whenever you're ready. <span><a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Cold Wave"">Cold Wave</a></span>, <span><a data-name=""Giant Trunade"">Giant Trunade</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a></span> should get the job done.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Necessary Rulings</span>  <span>Volcanic Queen doesn't say it on her card text as she is lacking any reprints but her effect that burns a monster by sending a monster you control to the GY sends for cost. That means you cannot send Tokens for the effect.</span>  <span>Cyber Valley's effect to banish and draw 2 does not banish for cost. You can banish it and a token and still draw 2.</span>  <span>You are legally allowed to activate Remove Brainwashing and Owner's Seal even if you don't have enough free monster zones available. In that case you return as many monsters as you can and the rest are sent to the GY and considered to be destroyed by game mechanic. That means that if you cannot take control of all Nightmare Archfiends-Tokens they are destroyed while in they are in your opponent's posession and your opponent therefore takes the 800 effect damage per destroyed Token.</span>  <span>Once a monster's control has been given to its owner the control will not change back when Remove Brainwashing is removed from the field. The monster is yours for the keeping.</span>  <span>Cold Wave does not negate already applying continuous-like effects.

My attempt is semi budget since it doesn't include the expensive Despia cards ,but utilizes a small Thunder Dragon engine.  With this deck, you can end on a board of Mirrorjade + Dragostapelia + Titan + Mercourier in hand, but you can also brick horroibly and just set 1 pass.  The card Fusion Gate is a very cool budget option in this deck. With two Dark monsters with different Types in hand (optimal TDroar + Mercourier) you can go into Dragostapelia while also searching for Kitt, which will get you to Branded Fusion.  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!  &lt;&lt;Edit:  I upgradet the decklist.  Reduced TD's since the only real starter for that line is Dragonroar. Added the Gizmek and Albion instead. Albion dump Branded Blade to draw one and recycle is really nice. Some other minor changes toÂ  enhance gameplay. Endboard stays fundamentally the same. &gt;&gt;"

I'm just bringing and updated version of my deck. Didn't change how the engine works by itself, but i adpted it for the current master duel meta and some necessities that the deck has. i will explain:  &nbsp;  On the last version i focused on using the tech slots to play against Maxx 'C' using 3 ashes 2 gammas and 2 called by the grave. it definitively works, but it takes away some of the consistency that this deck could have. (since ash blossom is a fire monster). So i decided to change some of the techs and put 3 veiler + 2 meister. They're meta relevant (plays against drytron, eldlich, tri-brigade, etc.) and they are light and dark monsters which makes Chaos Ruler effect's more relevant giving it a plenty of options to search.  &nbsp;  that's it. I will drop one of my videos that shows what this deck is capable of. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as i do :)  &nbsp;  <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Qn8DHYOvU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>"

Added deck strategy.</span>  A flexible deck, every other duel you could draw the cards needed for invoked summoning, or shaddoll summoning. Either work very well, or if you're lucky both.  Invoked strategy: You draw an aleister the invoker? Normal summon, and add invocation to your hand, you link summon Artemis the magistus moon maiden, and then fusion summon Invoked Mechaba using Invocation.  Dogmatika/Albaz strategy: I use dogmatika and albaz for a monster negate and monster removal, useful for monsters that cant be destroyed by battle or card effects. I use albaz to tribute opponents troublesome monsters. Dogmatika monsters have OTK potential, and could be used as fusion material for El Shaddoll Construct and Invoked Mechaba.  Shaddoll strategy: You want to efficiently use your flip monster effects here, Reeshaddoll Wendi is a great card and the most aggressive. Ideally you would want to get Winda out there as a special summon limiter. Shaddoll Schism is your ace in the hole, you will want it in a long game.  My thoughts: I like to run 3 Cosmic Cyclone here because Skill drain is such a terrible card to encounter. And 3 Crossout Designator because I was sick of my opponents always playing handtraps, both have been good additions. I am missing one more ""Dark Ruler No More"" it has been an excellent card and I like it a lot more than Effect veiler, Forbidden droplet, and Infinite impermanence.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You want to go second because you can't really do anything going first if you don't open exactly Test Tiger, a level 4 or lower Gladiator Beast and either <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Attoric"">Gladiator Beast Attorix</a>Â or <a data-name=""Gladiator Beast Augustus"">Gladiator Beast Augustus</a> in hand (you can go into Draglubion with those 3 cards). Going second gives you an extra card, allows you to attack toÂ  start combos and makes <a data-name=""Ancient Warrior - Loyal Guan Yun"">Ancient Warriors - Loyal Guan Yun</a> a lot better, who is especially good in this deck because he opens up attack possibilities for your Gladiator Beasts. The deck is mostly build to make XYZ of different levels consistently. The huge downside is that you either have to attack (especially difficult after your first turn because you opponent can make it harder by only having monsters with high ATK and nothing in defense) or use multiple cards for that. <a data-name=""My body as a Shield"">My body as a Shield</a> is pretty bad, but this deck loses hard to <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, so I have it in for now (you can try <a data-name=""Nobleman of Extermination"">Nobleman of Extermination</a> instead, but that isn't perfect either).  Standard plays: <ul>  	<li>Attack with a Gladiator/Use Tiger on it to summon Augustus from deck, which then summons another Augustus or Attoric from hand to go into Draglubion for Heart-Earth (Attoric sends Augustus from deck)</li>  	<li>If you have either Comeback or Rejection you can attack/Tiger into Attoric, which either sends Octavarius from deck (to revive it with Combeack) or Gaiodiaz from extra deck (and then you summon Octavarius from deck with Rejection) to go into a level 7 XYZ</li>  	<li>Darius opens up level 4's and Tiger and Rejection open up the level 3's, Monk of the Tenyi is only there for Vishuda lines (I would definitely play 3 Vishuda if it was possible) and Geonator into Berserker are really strong if your opponent doesn't play around it or overextends too much</li> </ul>"

Kuraz can pop your own marshmacaron, baobaboon, tokens or chainable backrow for draw or clear some of the opponent's field before OTK. Refer to my other list for combos and tech choices. It's an easy deck to pilotÂ  with a simple game plan :)  https://ygoprodeck.com/hippo-carnival-n-r-event/"

The extra deck can be filled with whatever you like other than Number 39: Utopia Roots just so you can trick opponents using similar decks to self FTK first.

You end on like 1 negate but the end board kind of changes depending on","This is not a completive cause as you can see, hopefully, there is no hand traps apart from Nibiru I guess. This deck is for fun, but it is more of a template for you to build onto so it can hopefully be a lot better. But I like decks with no hand traps and playing against bots on Nexus and testing hands on Edo, so I didn't add any, but Nibiru which is fun to watch your opponent cry as their entire board is destroyed in seconds. But because I don't like them, I didn't add many, it makes the deck more fun in my opinion? It can still beat decks even if they have a few negates out, but you need a really good hand to do so. I hope you like this deck the few people who see this and have fun dueling."

It gave us some really cool monsters that are still fan favorites to this day like Yubel, Elemental HERO Neos, Cyber Dragon. People tend to be really fond of Hydrogeddon and Crystal Beasts and Volcanics have dedicated fanbases, yearning and screeching until the day they receive playable support. Although HEROs are Jaden's signature monsters I always found the Neo-Spacians and Neos monster pretty cool. Sadly, there were anything but playable if we don't count Grand Mole as a removal tool. So you can imagine that I was incredibly stoked to see that someone created a deck in Edison that actually made use of the Neo-Spacians! And I gotta say, this deck is the reason I started writing these Edison decks in the first place. Now here's a quick disclaimer: I've only recently build this deck and played it much less than the others (as in test hands and nothing else as I've been really busy ever since I got this deck). But I gotta say this deck is incredibly fun on paper, the 50-ish test hands I had were so cool and the idea behind the deck is awesome. Here's to probably one of my favorite Edison decks: <span>Neo-Spacian.</span></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strategy</span>  <span>In short, this deck revolves around card advantage. Almost every card in your deck interacts with <span><a data-name=""Cross Porter"">Cross Porter</a></span>, who will then add you a Neo-Spacian to hand.</span>  <span>All you need is a Cross Porter in the GY and you can summon Synchro monsters almost every turn while gaining Neo-Spacians in the process. The Neo-Spacians themselves are somewhat of a toolbox. While the monsters are pretty weak by themselves their effects can be pretty good in niche situations, some more niche than others.</span>  <span>You could consider this deck baby Diva HERO. It's a little less explosive and summons <span><a data-name=""Iron Chain Dragon"">Iron Chain Dragon</a></span> more often than it does <span><a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a></span> but what it lacks in explosiveness and pressure it makes up for with the Neo-Spacian toolbox and the crazy amount of draws and adds at your disposal. <span><a data-name=""Snipe Hunter"">Snipe Hunter</a></span> will almost always have plenty of discards available and <span><a data-name=""Tragoedia"">Tragoedia</a></span> will pretty much sit at 3000 ATK constantly. You can manipulate the GY to incredible detail ensuring <span><a data-name=""Dark Armed Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a></span> is live the second you want it to.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Cards and Engines</span>  <span>The heart and soul of the deck is Cross Porter. When it is sent to the GY you can add a Neo-Spacian from deck to hand. Note, that it's an optional when effect, meaning it being sent has to be the very last thing to have happened in the previous chain/action before the trigger is met. If you discard it for cost, say for Snipe Hunter, it will not trigger as the last thing was the resolution of Sniper Hunter's effect. You can trigger it with <span><a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a></span> and it meets the criteria for both <span><a data-name=""Debris Dragon"">Debris Dragon</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Junk Synchron"">Junk Synchron</a></span>, who'll both negate Porters effect on the field but you only care about the effect in the GY anyways. Once you perform a Synchro summon the trigger will be met and you can add a Neo-Spacian to hand, while putting up pressure on board.</span>  <span>Since you'll be adding a Neo-Spacian to hand almost every turn <span><a data-name=""Convert Contact"">Convert Contact</a></span> is not only a draw 2 with little to no setup required but also sets up your GY for <span><a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a></span>. This means that <span><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Grand Mole"">Neo-Spacian Grand Mole</a></span>, who's limited for a reason, can be recycled multiple times. Almost all your monsters are DARK so you'll always have a card to banish with Allure of Darkness. If you don't know what to banish you can just add <span><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Dark Panther"">Neo-Spacian Dark Panther</a></span> and banish a copy of that one.</span>  <span>Let's talk about the Neo-Spacians. The previously mentioned Neo-Spacian Dark Panther can copy the effect of an opponent's monster. That means you can steal the pwerful effects of Dark Armed Dragon, <span><a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Ally of Justice Catastor"">Ally of Justice Catastor</a></span> to name a few. Besides Dark Panther this deck is on a copy of <span><a data-name=""Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin"">Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin</a></span> and Neo-Spacian Grand Mole. The former is most commonly knows by Isolde handloops, back when Linkross was still around. You can still handloop when you have a Synchro on board but most importantly you gain knowledge into your opponent's hand. Knowing your opponent has for example <span><a data-name=""Heavy Storm"">Heavy Storm</a></span> or <span><a data-name=""Mirror Force"">Mirror Force</a></span> in hand can be game changing. Grand Mole bounces itself and the monster it is battling back to hand, which is a great out to many strong monsters without having to commit much. You'll be giving up your board presence but that's well worth being able to summon Grand Mole again on a later turn.</span>  &nbsp;  Credits go to www[dot]edisonformat[dot]com/decks/rogue-neo-spacian-toolbox"

The adventure engine uses the brave token to allow the effects of the ridable dragon, and wandering gryphon rider to go off, and uses the effect of water enchantress to add rite of aramesir that special summon the token and activates fateful adventure from the deck (which allows you to add gryphon rider from deck to hand and equip rideable dragon to the token).  The DPE engine allows you to summon Destiny Hero - Destroy Pheonix Enforcer and use his effect to destroy your opponent's cards ( at a cost of destroying one of yours) and weaken your opponent monsters for every hero in the grave and if he were to be destroyed special summons a destiny hero from the grave including himself. As a bonus Destiny hero - Dasher during the draw phase if you draw a monster you can special summon that drawn monster without cost (but you can only do this once) and if you have no cards in your hand you can banish Destiny Hero - Celestial and one other Destiny hero to draw 2 cards."

Being able to send Fraktall, Kitt, and Nervall to the GY, but not add Kerass can still be useful since you are adding materials for Tri-Brigade Link Summons. Tri-Brigade monsters can also summon Gladiator Beast Dragases, allowing you to summon additional Gladiator Beasts, either through Dragases's own effect or by using Test Tiger.  You can use your first Augustus to summon a second Augustus, who can then summon a third Gladiator Beast. Tamer Editor's effect to summon Fusion Monsters is only once per turn per copy, so you can summon a second Tamer Editor and summon a new Fusion Monster. If you cannot summon both Heraklinos and Domitianus, the early turns of the duel will likely depend on which one you choose, depending on whether you are more concerned with monster effects or Spells and Traps. Discard costs for Heraklinos and Twin Twisters will trigger Nervall and Kitt's effects, making them viable to keep in hand for the next turn."
