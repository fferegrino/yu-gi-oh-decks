MOST DEFINITELY! Cheers to another year of milling in the meta!,"<p>Are Tearlaments still relevant and competitive in 2026? MOST DEFINITELY! Cheers to another year of milling in the meta with the strongest deck of all time!<br /><br />At first, Gem-Knights sound like a very strange set of cards to include in a milling strategy in Tearlements, especially over powerful engines such as Millenium and Horus, but these crystal knights grant a ton of amazing benefits!</p><p>First of all, Gem-Knight Nepyrim triggers when sent to GY, summoning itself by sending a card from hand, which further enables your Tearlament effects in-hand! Nepyrim also searches from deck Gem-Knight Quartz and grants you a free normal summon. These two cards are both level 4s, allowing for an XYZ summon of Dugares! Dugares main function would be to draw 2 and discard 1 card for effect, which furthers your Tearlament effects and grants extra consistency!&nbsp;</p><p>Did you know that Gem Knight's ace card Brilliant Fusion is a 1-card Tearlament Kitkallos? Brilliant Fusion summons Gem-Knight Amethyst by sending Nepyrim + Any Tearlament girl from deck, and being a Aqua card, can be used as fusion material for Kitkallos! Nepyrim can also summon itself from the GY granting you more cards, more draws, and more bodies for further plays!&nbsp;<br /><br />The Gem-Knight maindeck monsters are also all fairies, which enable a sizeable fairy package to be used in Tearlaments like Diviner (1 card Baronne by sending Nepyrim to GY), Herald of orange/green light (monster/spell negate), Eva (searches for fairies when milled) and Vingolf's Blessing (foolish burial Nepyrim and when milled it can reborn a fairy).&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, this variant of Tearlament plays the same - mill a ton of stuff, power through interruption with a lot of gas and create unbreakable boards!<br /><br /><em>And remember, Tiaraments strongest~</em><br /><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose""><br /></span><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Of course you do the combo line for Kali Yuga, which is turn skip for the opponent. Also you can easily do any synchro level 10, by first ss any kashtira (best if you start with Unicorn) , then normal Gullinbursti , effect to ss any Nordic from hand, so you can do your Nordic combo after, and using Gullinbursti and the Kashtira to go for any synchro 10 (best of course is Baronne de Fleur, so you can protect Gullveig later , but for now it is banned in TCG unfortunately) .</p>"
