MOST DEFINITELY! Cheers to another year of milling in the meta!,"<p>Are Tearlaments still relevant and competitive in 2026? MOST DEFINITELY! Cheers to another year of milling in the meta with the strongest deck of all time!<br /><br />At first, Gem-Knights sound like a very strange set of cards to include in a milling strategy in Tearlements, especially over powerful engines such as Millenium and Horus, but these crystal knights grant a ton of amazing benefits!</p><p>First of all, Gem-Knight Nepyrim triggers when sent to GY, summoning itself by sending a card from hand, which further enables your Tearlament effects in-hand! Nepyrim also searches from deck Gem-Knight Quartz and grants you a free normal summon. These two cards are both level 4s, allowing for an XYZ summon of Dugares! Dugares main function would be to draw 2 and discard 1 card for effect, which furthers your Tearlament effects and grants extra consistency!&nbsp;</p><p>Did you know that Gem Knight's ace card Brilliant Fusion is a 1-card Tearlament Kitkallos? Brilliant Fusion summons Gem-Knight Amethyst by sending Nepyrim + Any Tearlament girl from deck, and being a Aqua card, can be used as fusion material for Kitkallos! Nepyrim can also summon itself from the GY granting you more cards, more draws, and more bodies for further plays!&nbsp;<br /><br />The Gem-Knight maindeck monsters are also all fairies, which enable a sizeable fairy package to be used in Tearlaments like Diviner (1 card Baronne by sending Nepyrim to GY), Herald of orange/green light (monster/spell negate), Eva (searches for fairies when milled) and Vingolf's Blessing (foolish burial Nepyrim and when milled it can reborn a fairy).&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, this variant of Tearlament plays the same - mill a ton of stuff, power through interruption with a lot of gas and create unbreakable boards!<br /><br /><em>And remember, Tiaraments strongest~</em><br /><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose""><br /></span><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Of course you do the combo line for Kali Yuga, which is turn skip for the opponent. Also you can easily do any synchro level 10, by first ss any kashtira (best if you start with Unicorn) , then normal Gullinbursti , effect to ss any Nordic from hand, so you can do your Nordic combo after, and using Gullinbursti and the Kashtira to go for any synchro 10 (best of course is Baronne de Fleur, so you can protect Gullveig later , but for now it is banned in TCG unfortunately) .</p>"

Mikanko has reached Tenpai levels of consistency and power, allowing it to handtrap opponents into a halfboard, then smashing through with 12000+ damage with Uzuhime's triple attack boosted with Double-Edged sword!<br /><br />Cheese out wins consistently towards opponents who are consistently not ready to face 18+ handtraps and untargetable, indestructible, battle-immune shrine maidens! Not only are these ladies beautiful, they're terrifyingly potent and they interact with opponent's boards in ways that most decks aren't ready for!<br /><br />Here is the deck's new combo with Mikanko Divine Dance:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Activate Divine Dance to send to GY Sanaki, the Mikanko Devotee and set from deck Mikanko Fire Dance.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Activate Fire Dance to summon Sanaki from the GY.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Activate Sanaki's on-summon effect to summon from deck either Hu-Li or Ha-Re.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Activate Sanaki's effect to return Fire Dance to your hand.&nbsp;</p><p>5. XYZ summon Uzuhime using Sanaki + a level 3 Mikanko.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Uzuhime's on-summon effect searches for Double-Edged Sword from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>7. If your opponent has an empty board, equip Double-Edged Sword to Uzuhime or if your opponent has an attack position monster, you can equip it to them instead.&nbsp;</p><p>8.

For this we use the new Dracotail Card: Dracotail Faimena.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>WHY NOT FULL DRACOTAIL?</strong></em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">So right now, you're probably asking, why not just play Branded/Dracotail? Well first of, I dislike the way Dracotail deck plays, it's just not for me. Secondly, I don't think they're a good mix of decks. Dracotail requires around 3-4 monsters in hand, where as Branded needs starters in hand and powerful spells. Not only that, Branded needs a few brick/garnet traps to run at full power (""Banishment"", ""Retribution""), this is also the case for Dracotail. In total you're looking at 5-6 traps that you want to search and not draw. There's just too many bricks/garnets, theres a very high chance you find them in starting hand, and if you want Dracotail to run smooth, you really can't afford first hand space to be clogged with bricks and I think that just goes to say for the meta.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>OKAY, SO HOW IS IT BETTER?</strong></em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dracotail Faimena is hands down the best card in Dracotail. Quick Effect from hand, fusions using cards from hand or field to either make a spellcaster or dragon. And it can do this, on your opponents first turn. So this can make just about anything from our extra deck on the opponents turn based on what you draw. Specifically, Saronir &amp; Albion. Both of these cards have effects in GY to send Branded Fusion + Retribution allowing you to garuntee a branded fusion straight from deck on your turn. Bystial has a little second power with this. Something like a Druiswurm, you first can use its effect to banish. Then fuse it with Faimena, making more interruption, and then sending itself to the GY to send another special summoned monster. Making it 3 interruptions at least on opponents turn. We can also use this method to make Dragoon for the omni-negate, and Restrict using ""Light Hex"" plus any card. Giving good interruption, and ways to negate Handtraps against our Branded Fusion for our turn.&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>TLDR;</strong> Dracotail Faimena allows us to both boardbreak and set up full branded combo on the opponents turn. Giving multiple interruptions and protection for your turn all while setting up your engine cards in the GY for their effects on your turn.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><em>THAT SOUNDS GOOD, EXPLAIN YOUR CARD CHOICES!</em></strong></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Albion Shrouded Dragon x3</strong> - Amazing in hand card, main effect is for cost so can't be interacted with, and if its in hand, puts itself to deck and draws. +2, also the effect can be used in GY but you don't get the draw.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Bystial Saronir 2-3x</strong> - Both Handtrap and engine, sending to GY sends either Branded Fusion or Retribution.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Bystial Druiswurm 1-2x</strong> - Strong Handtrap, has an extra power sending a special summoned monster to GY if it was sent from field. If you feel like you draw too many non-engine, remove a copy of this card and add another Saronir.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Bystial Lubellion 0-1x</strong> - Lubellion can search Saronir, so its an extra copy of it, mostly its used to send Albion from field, to make sure to get the set and is used to make LDD. Without a continous spell, its only useful for what mentioned prior, but another card that can be a brick, so i cut it. You can send this with Grangogonal if you need to.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Fallen of Albaz 3-2x</strong> - You need 2 for sure, most decks typically run 3, but with 2 Light Hex, its like 4 copies of Albaz.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Blazing Cartesia 2x</strong> - Playing 1 makes it too uncommon and forces you to send it with Quem. 3 feels way to many. 2 is just right, even if one gets banished.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Quem The Virtuous 2-3x</strong> - I prefer 3 quem, then its the case of drawing Quem/Saronir/Albion/Spirits, any combonation of these 4 gets us full combo. Quem gives insane grind game as the game goes on, and constantly gives the opponent a card to worry about, you're almost never are out of options when Quem is on the field. Absolutely love having this card at 3, its so consistent and powerful.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Dracotail Faimena 3x</strong> - You want to see it in hand as often as possible as its part of our interruption, so 3 copies + draw power gives us high chance of finding Faimena turn 0.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The Light Hex 2x</strong> - A very powerful card, supplments any name, Fallen of Albaz, Blazing Cartesia, Dark Magician, Relinquished.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Mulcharmy Fuwalos 3x</strong> - More draw power, can force an ash blossom but also can draw you into Faimena or another boardbreaker.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Ash Blossom 3x</strong> - Stops Maxx C / Mulcharmy.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Maxx 2x</strong> - Can force an ash blossom but also can draw you into Faimena or another boardbreaker. Is powerful enough to end a turn early.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Crossout/Called By Grave 1x | 1x</strong> - Negates the main handtraps, Ash/Maxx C/Mulcharmy</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Harpie's Feather Duster/Heavy Storm 1x | 1x</strong> - Spell &amp; Traps are very powerful right now, Dracotail, Odion, Lab, Maliss, Ryzeal, Orcust Babel, Sky Striker, Yummy &amp; Mitsurugi, all have good set cards ready for interruption.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Super Polymerization 3x</strong> - Our main boardbreaker, capable of stopping almost all decks. Can also be chained to Quem/Cartesia to dodge targeted negates.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Branded Fusion 2x</strong> - The Go button on the deck. Used to get your combo going and make a near unbreakable board.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Branded in High Spirits 3-2x</strong> - Sends from Extra Deck, Discards card and adds another engine. Important for consistency.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Banishment/Retribution/Sword 1x | 1x | 1x</strong> - Each one has a powerful use;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&gt; <em>Banishment</em> is the perfect set with Albion, allowing you to make LDD.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&gt; <em>Retrubition</em> used to add Branded Fusion from GY to hand, avoiding Droll.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&gt; <em>Sword</em> main recursion for our monsters that get banished.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>"

Im not fully convinced on ragnar as i think thomas is safer (as it allows for easy follow up the turn after )&nbsp; but ragnarok is good for going first combos. I also like to play a much more maximum deck with orthos and swirl slime 3 copies of scale and count and&nbsp; a defense soldier as i like the consistency and this deck is very hard to be explicitly bricky though realistically the only mandatory card is 1 copy of count the rest can easily be either a diffrent engine like fiendsmith or non enginge. ALSO do play dominus it is actually good though if you do dont play big alexander obviously. I also like eternal darkness over witch though it will depend on meta and playstyle. the extra deck is alot more flexible then it seems, there is 3 flex spots that being small ceasar kali and second machinex (and alfred but tbh alfred is a free big ceasar so id say mandatory). I like these, i think small ceaser helps with big material zeus or just recursion and 2 machinex feel right they are sorta get out of jail free card when needing a special summon but could be cut for big genghis due to the swirl and it being lvl 8&nbsp; or bright armagedon depends on what you like, and kali is good due to the many lvl 8 and is why the side deck are some other generic rank 8s that can be played instead. You can also make the flex spots into a super poly package (i cant afford it but youd just add mud dragon and garura or any other that might be good for the meta) or fiendsmith (same). Lastly nightmare throne is better then dark spirit mastery in my opionion in every way but since you already have multiple 3 offs the consistency is kinda overkill (also cant afford).</p>"

With the difficulty of the deck coming from how you pilot it, knowledge of your opponent's deck, knowledge of the overall game, as well as knowing how to play around your opponent to take control of the duel and secure a win. Thus, the control style of the Deck. <br />It is also why I am giving a more so overview of the deck and how it is played instead of giving a full set-up combo, as the combo I will be giving is fairly simple.

I recommend using this effect last as this might clutter up your Main Monster Zone, thus not allowing your Sky Striker Spells to be able to activate.

(Do note Azalea uses only Light and/or Dark monster as material and Azalea Temperance has to include a Link Monster while also being a Link 3, which can be a benefit or a curse.)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Overall, Sky Strikers is a pretty cool deck and a fan favorite for a reason as well as one of my favorites as well. Easy to learn on paper, hard to play in practice, and it takes a lot of skill to fully bring out the potential of this deck even at this more so ""pure"" form. I hope you enjoy!<br /><br /></p>"

Puzzlomino's tricky effects help solve niche game states.</p><p>Puzzlomino's first effect can modulate the level of a monster special summoned to a zone that it points to. This effect can make Xyz summoning easier, and it also pairs well with Puzzlomino's second effect, which can target 2 monsters that have the same level from each field, then destroy them. This effect is great for triggering your Yubel monster effects, and clearing boards. Ideally, you'd special summon a Yubel monster to a zone Puzzlomino points to, change its level to match one of the opponent's face-up monsters, then destroy both monsters.

I have NO idea how to make this deck more casual. Maybe adding more weaker Fusion Monster you can Fusion into instead of ""Meta Staples"" or stronger generic cards. Because even as a ""Pure"" deck, this deck can be really consistent and can still get out full combo of its Main ""Boss Monsters"" onto the field. You could replace the more generic support cards in the Main Deck for more copies of the ""in archetype"" cards or perhaps other, weaker generic support cards. But nothing really comes in mind without </span><span class=""cf0"">abosuletly</span><span class=""cf0""> ""bricking"" this deck.

The deck truly could not be beat in terms of power, consistency, and speed and could not ""brick."" (open up a poor opening hand) If you weren't also playing </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> during the time of its reign or specifically playing a deck that beat </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0"">, you were almost always going to lose.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""cf0"">The deck was also unique in being able to play during ""Turn 0"" aka during your opponent's turn and being able to set up its own powerful board alongside the opponent. And the deck was just too fast that the </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> player would probably already have a fully set up board and be able to interrupt your </span><span class=""cf0"">playings</span><span class=""cf0""> WHILE you were playing to set up your own board on YOUR TURN. They also had very little room for disruption as they could keep chaining their effects to each other, leaving very little breathing room and interaction windows for the opposing player to play against. Today, decks can now be seen also being able to play on their opponent's turn, but they still needed some form of starter or set up, so they can never have a ""Turn 0"" board and have a fully built board during the opponent's turn. (Decks like </span><span class=""cf0"">Dracotail</span><span class=""cf0""> can Fusion Summon on the opponent's turn and </span><span class=""cf0"">Labrynth</span><span class=""cf0""> can play a trap during the opponent's turn but not truly set up a full powered board from just a singular card WITHOUT even getting to their first official turn.)</span></p><p><span class=""cf0"">Many more modern decks (at the time of writing this, January 2026) can now probably compete with </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> in terms of power level and just how insanely broken and good decks have become. But this also could be attributed to how decks function nowadays and the power of individual cards as newer and more powerful cards are released to increase power-creep and get the people interested and entertained. With </span><span class=""cf0"">Kashtira</span><span class=""cf0""> and </span><span class=""cf0"">Maliss</span><span class=""cf0""> decks being almost full-blown counters to this deck as a whole as those decks mainly focus on Banishing as a mechanic. </span></p><p><span class=""cf0"">In terms on ""Unrestricted"" or ""Unlimited"" formats, there are probably more powerful decks out there nowadays that can fully utilize all the power of some of the most overpowered cards to ever exist (Such as <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=74191942"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/74191942.jpg"" data-card=""74191942"" data-name=""Painful Choice"">Painful Choice</span></a>, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=85602018"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/85602018.jpg"" data-card=""85602018"" data-name=""Last Will"">Last Will</span></a>, pre-</span><span class=""cf0"">errated</span> <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=26202165"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26202165.jpg"" data-card=""26202165"" data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</span></a><span class=""cf0""> and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=78010363"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78010363.jpg"" data-card=""78010363"" data-name=""Witch of the Black Forest"">Witch of the Black Forest</span></a>, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=79571449"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79571449.jpg"" data-card=""79571449"" data-name=""Graceful Charity"">Graceful Charity</span></a>, and <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=55144522"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/55144522.jpg"" data-card=""55144522"" data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</span></a>) but even then, </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> can still stand on its own without any of those cards.

As stated before, the deck is a Graveyard and Fusion centered deck, with all the Main Deck </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> cards having effects when they are sent to the Graveyard by card effect. And you accomplish this by using many of the </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> card's ""mill"" effects (sending an X amount of cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard). The Main Deck Monsters also all having their own unique, powerful effects themselves, AND they all share a ""Fusion Summoning Effect"" when they are sent to the Graveyard by card effect; being able to Fusion Summon with materials in the Graveyard, field, or the hand. This means you are easily able to bring out the deck's 2 Main Boss Monsters without the need of a specific Fusion Spell like <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=24094653"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/24094653.jpg"" data-card=""24094653"" data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</span></a>. Not only that, but they will also shuffle themselves back to the bottom of the deck or Extra Deck when they Fusion Summon using this effect, so they never truly ""leave play"" as you will be able to either draw into them later or send them to the Graveyard again to activate their effects.<br /><br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> is a strong but very hard deck to learn and master as it is very skill intensive and it involves A LOT of interaction between you and your opponent. It involves you knowing what your cards do, when to activate them at optimal times, how they can react to each other as well, and of course your match-ups and overall knowledge of what your opponent's deck might do also help </span><span class=""cf0"">tremendiously</span><span class=""cf0"">.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""cf0"">An important sidenote I should say before getting into this is that all the </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> Fusion Summoning effects are all ONCE PER TURN.

If Chimera Fusion or a way to Polymerization is drawn, Chimera Fusion can be set to fuse into Dragostapelia or Magnum the Reliever. Fusion Armament can provide an additional beast to use for fusions and can make a Mirror Swordknight in GY a live negate early into a combo. Buio is a fiend that can fuse into Luce after a full combo using fiends or fairies in GY. Diabellstar Vengeance's effect can summon Silvera on the opponent's turn or Poplar to quick synchro into Chengying on the opponent's turn, triggering Chengying's effect with various GY effects that banish for cost. Rciela is also an option that can serch for Effect Veiler if desired. Non-engine and side decks are merely samples and can be modified to fit a given meta, but fiends, beasts like Hop-Eared Squadron, or fairies like Lancea are appreciated.</p>"

With this incredible power, it's time to tear apart ladder with Albaz and his newfound friends! (I speak from personal experience, this is the deck I used to reach Masters 1 this season).<br /><br />These spellcaster dragons do relatively few actions for a lot of impact! Everytime you fusion summon with Dracotail monsters, can set a Dracotail spell/trap from deck, then get an additional effect which breaks your opponent's board, giving this strategy inherent board breaking capabilities. Dracotail Faimena can also fusion summon as a quick effect during the Main Phase, meaning you can fusion summon turn 0 and immediately start interrupting your opponent! This low amount of special summons Dracotail does allows it to perfectly play in Maxx ""C,"" creating a lot of advantage and interruptions while minimizing the amount of draws your opponent gets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Paired with Branded, Dracotail becomes near unstoppable! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! This strategy generates a ton of massive beatsticks on field, smashes through established boards with in-engine cards, and generates a ton of advantage! Albax and Phryxul has truly made the ultimate fusion strategy!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Set whatever traps you may have. PaSs.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, VERY casual deck. Most cards will send a ""Red-Eyes"" monster to the Graveyard which you can bring back with many of your Trap Cards' effects and most of the ""good"" Red-Eyes cards will use ""burn"" strategies. <br />And a lot of the older cards depend on your opponent either attacking into them or doing something, so it's more so for very casual and slow paced Duels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall still, this deck can be very fun in very casual Duel and settings with your friends and even has an OP Boss Monster you can go into (<a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=37818794"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/37818794.jpg"" data-card=""37818794"" data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</span></a>) which you always swap out if you want to be more casual.

The deck mainly wants a lot of Monster cards in the deck in order to use as material for their Fusion Summons. The deck is very consistent and can run other engines in order to make it even more consistent, fuse into other powerful Monsters, or extend the capabilities of the deck.
