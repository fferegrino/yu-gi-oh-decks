MOST DEFINITELY! Cheers to another year of milling in the meta!,"<p>Are Tearlaments still relevant and competitive in 2026? MOST DEFINITELY! Cheers to another year of milling in the meta with the strongest deck of all time!<br /><br />At first, Gem-Knights sound like a very strange set of cards to include in a milling strategy in Tearlements, especially over powerful engines such as Millenium and Horus, but these crystal knights grant a ton of amazing benefits!</p><p>First of all, Gem-Knight Nepyrim triggers when sent to GY, summoning itself by sending a card from hand, which further enables your Tearlament effects in-hand! Nepyrim also searches from deck Gem-Knight Quartz and grants you a free normal summon. These two cards are both level 4s, allowing for an XYZ summon of Dugares! Dugares main function would be to draw 2 and discard 1 card for effect, which furthers your Tearlament effects and grants extra consistency!&nbsp;</p><p>Did you know that Gem Knight's ace card Brilliant Fusion is a 1-card Tearlament Kitkallos? Brilliant Fusion summons Gem-Knight Amethyst by sending Nepyrim + Any Tearlament girl from deck, and being a Aqua card, can be used as fusion material for Kitkallos! Nepyrim can also summon itself from the GY granting you more cards, more draws, and more bodies for further plays!&nbsp;<br /><br />The Gem-Knight maindeck monsters are also all fairies, which enable a sizeable fairy package to be used in Tearlaments like Diviner (1 card Baronne by sending Nepyrim to GY), Herald of orange/green light (monster/spell negate), Eva (searches for fairies when milled) and Vingolf's Blessing (foolish burial Nepyrim and when milled it can reborn a fairy).&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, this variant of Tearlament plays the same - mill a ton of stuff, power through interruption with a lot of gas and create unbreakable boards!<br /><br /><em>And remember, Tiaraments strongest~</em><br /><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"" data-olk-copy-source=""MailCompose""><br /></span><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Of course you do the combo line for Kali Yuga, which is turn skip for the opponent. Also you can easily do any synchro level 10, by first ss any kashtira (best if you start with Unicorn) , then normal Gullinbursti , effect to ss any Nordic from hand, so you can do your Nordic combo after, and using Gullinbursti and the Kashtira to go for any synchro 10 (best of course is Baronne de Fleur, so you can protect Gullveig later , but for now it is banned in TCG unfortunately) .</p>"

Mikanko has reached Tenpai levels of consistency and power, allowing it to handtrap opponents into a halfboard, then smashing through with 12000+ damage with Uzuhime's triple attack boosted with Double-Edged sword!<br /><br />Cheese out wins consistently towards opponents who are consistently not ready to face 18+ handtraps and untargetable, indestructible, battle-immune shrine maidens! Not only are these ladies beautiful, they're terrifyingly potent and they interact with opponent's boards in ways that most decks aren't ready for!<br /><br />Here is the deck's new combo with Mikanko Divine Dance:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Activate Divine Dance to send to GY Sanaki, the Mikanko Devotee and set from deck Mikanko Fire Dance.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Activate Fire Dance to summon Sanaki from the GY.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Activate Sanaki's on-summon effect to summon from deck either Hu-Li or Ha-Re.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Activate Sanaki's effect to return Fire Dance to your hand.&nbsp;</p><p>5. XYZ summon Uzuhime using Sanaki + a level 3 Mikanko.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Uzuhime's on-summon effect searches for Double-Edged Sword from deck.&nbsp;</p><p>7. If your opponent has an empty board, equip Double-Edged Sword to Uzuhime or if your opponent has an attack position monster, you can equip it to them instead.&nbsp;</p><p>8.

For this we use the new Dracotail Card: Dracotail Faimena.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>WHY NOT FULL DRACOTAIL?</strong></em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">So right now, you're probably asking, why not just play Branded/Dracotail? Well first of, I dislike the way Dracotail deck plays, it's just not for me. Secondly, I don't think they're a good mix of decks. Dracotail requires around 3-4 monsters in hand, where as Branded needs starters in hand and powerful spells. Not only that, Branded needs a few brick/garnet traps to run at full power (""Banishment"", ""Retribution""), this is also the case for Dracotail. In total you're looking at 5-6 traps that you want to search and not draw. There's just too many bricks/garnets, theres a very high chance you find them in starting hand, and if you want Dracotail to run smooth, you really can't afford first hand space to be clogged with bricks and I think that just goes to say for the meta.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>OKAY, SO HOW IS IT BETTER?</strong></em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Dracotail Faimena is hands down the best card in Dracotail. Quick Effect from hand, fusions using cards from hand or field to either make a spellcaster or dragon. And it can do this, on your opponents first turn. So this can make just about anything from our extra deck on the opponents turn based on what you draw. Specifically, Saronir &amp; Albion. Both of these cards have effects in GY to send Branded Fusion + Retribution allowing you to garuntee a branded fusion straight from deck on your turn. Bystial has a little second power with this. Something like a Druiswurm, you first can use its effect to banish. Then fuse it with Faimena, making more interruption, and then sending itself to the GY to send another special summoned monster. Making it 3 interruptions at least on opponents turn. We can also use this method to make Dragoon for the omni-negate, and Restrict using ""Light Hex"" plus any card. Giving good interruption, and ways to negate Handtraps against our Branded Fusion for our turn.&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>TLDR;</strong> Dracotail Faimena allows us to both boardbreak and set up full branded combo on the opponents turn. Giving multiple interruptions and protection for your turn all while setting up your engine cards in the GY for their effects on your turn.</em></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><em>THAT SOUNDS GOOD, EXPLAIN YOUR CARD CHOICES!</em></strong></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Albion Shrouded Dragon x3</strong> - Amazing in hand card, main effect is for cost so can't be interacted with, and if its in hand, puts itself to deck and draws. +2, also the effect can be used in GY but you don't get the draw.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Bystial Saronir 2-3x</strong> - Both Handtrap and engine, sending to GY sends either Branded Fusion or Retribution.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Bystial Druiswurm 1-2x</strong> - Strong Handtrap, has an extra power sending a special summoned monster to GY if it was sent from field. If you feel like you draw too many non-engine, remove a copy of this card and add another Saronir.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Bystial Lubellion 0-1x</strong> - Lubellion can search Saronir, so its an extra copy of it, mostly its used to send Albion from field, to make sure to get the set and is used to make LDD. Without a continous spell, its only useful for what mentioned prior, but another card that can be a brick, so i cut it. You can send this with Grangogonal if you need to.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Fallen of Albaz 3-2x</strong> - You need 2 for sure, most decks typically run 3, but with 2 Light Hex, its like 4 copies of Albaz.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Blazing Cartesia 2x</strong> - Playing 1 makes it too uncommon and forces you to send it with Quem. 3 feels way to many. 2 is just right, even if one gets banished.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Quem The Virtuous 2-3x</strong> - I prefer 3 quem, then its the case of drawing Quem/Saronir/Albion/Spirits, any combonation of these 4 gets us full combo. Quem gives insane grind game as the game goes on, and constantly gives the opponent a card to worry about, you're almost never are out of options when Quem is on the field. Absolutely love having this card at 3, its so consistent and powerful.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Dracotail Faimena 3x</strong> - You want to see it in hand as often as possible as its part of our interruption, so 3 copies + draw power gives us high chance of finding Faimena turn 0.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The Light Hex 2x</strong> - A very powerful card, supplments any name, Fallen of Albaz, Blazing Cartesia, Dark Magician, Relinquished.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Mulcharmy Fuwalos 3x</strong> - More draw power, can force an ash blossom but also can draw you into Faimena or another boardbreaker.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Ash Blossom 3x</strong> - Stops Maxx C / Mulcharmy.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Maxx 2x</strong> - Can force an ash blossom but also can draw you into Faimena or another boardbreaker. Is powerful enough to end a turn early.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Crossout/Called By Grave 1x | 1x</strong> - Negates the main handtraps, Ash/Maxx C/Mulcharmy</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Harpie's Feather Duster/Heavy Storm 1x | 1x</strong> - Spell &amp; Traps are very powerful right now, Dracotail, Odion, Lab, Maliss, Ryzeal, Orcust Babel, Sky Striker, Yummy &amp; Mitsurugi, all have good set cards ready for interruption.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Super Polymerization 3x</strong> - Our main boardbreaker, capable of stopping almost all decks. Can also be chained to Quem/Cartesia to dodge targeted negates.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Branded Fusion 2x</strong> - The Go button on the deck. Used to get your combo going and make a near unbreakable board.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Branded in High Spirits 3-2x</strong> - Sends from Extra Deck, Discards card and adds another engine. Important for consistency.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Banishment/Retribution/Sword 1x | 1x | 1x</strong> - Each one has a powerful use;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&gt; <em>Banishment</em> is the perfect set with Albion, allowing you to make LDD.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&gt; <em>Retrubition</em> used to add Branded Fusion from GY to hand, avoiding Droll.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&gt; <em>Sword</em> main recursion for our monsters that get banished.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">&nbsp;</p>"

Im not fully convinced on ragnar as i think thomas is safer (as it allows for easy follow up the turn after )&nbsp; but ragnarok is good for going first combos. I also like to play a much more maximum deck with orthos and swirl slime 3 copies of scale and count and&nbsp; a defense soldier as i like the consistency and this deck is very hard to be explicitly bricky though realistically the only mandatory card is 1 copy of count the rest can easily be either a diffrent engine like fiendsmith or non enginge. ALSO do play dominus it is actually good though if you do dont play big alexander obviously. I also like eternal darkness over witch though it will depend on meta and playstyle. the extra deck is alot more flexible then it seems, there is 3 flex spots that being small ceasar kali and second machinex (and alfred but tbh alfred is a free big ceasar so id say mandatory). I like these, i think small ceaser helps with big material zeus or just recursion and 2 machinex feel right they are sorta get out of jail free card when needing a special summon but could be cut for big genghis due to the swirl and it being lvl 8&nbsp; or bright armagedon depends on what you like, and kali is good due to the many lvl 8 and is why the side deck are some other generic rank 8s that can be played instead. You can also make the flex spots into a super poly package (i cant afford it but youd just add mud dragon and garura or any other that might be good for the meta) or fiendsmith (same). Lastly nightmare throne is better then dark spirit mastery in my opionion in every way but since you already have multiple 3 offs the consistency is kinda overkill (also cant afford).</p>"

With the difficulty of the deck coming from how you pilot it, knowledge of your opponent's deck, knowledge of the overall game, as well as knowing how to play around your opponent to take control of the duel and secure a win. Thus, the control style of the Deck. <br />It is also why I am giving a more so overview of the deck and how it is played instead of giving a full set-up combo, as the combo I will be giving is fairly simple.

I recommend using this effect last as this might clutter up your Main Monster Zone, thus not allowing your Sky Striker Spells to be able to activate.

(Do note Azalea uses only Light and/or Dark monster as material and Azalea Temperance has to include a Link Monster while also being a Link 3, which can be a benefit or a curse.)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Overall, Sky Strikers is a pretty cool deck and a fan favorite for a reason as well as one of my favorites as well. Easy to learn on paper, hard to play in practice, and it takes a lot of skill to fully bring out the potential of this deck even at this more so ""pure"" form. I hope you enjoy!<br /><br /></p>"

Puzzlomino's tricky effects help solve niche game states.</p><p>Puzzlomino's first effect can modulate the level of a monster special summoned to a zone that it points to. This effect can make Xyz summoning easier, and it also pairs well with Puzzlomino's second effect, which can target 2 monsters that have the same level from each field, then destroy them. This effect is great for triggering your Yubel monster effects, and clearing boards. Ideally, you'd special summon a Yubel monster to a zone Puzzlomino points to, change its level to match one of the opponent's face-up monsters, then destroy both monsters.

I have NO idea how to make this deck more casual. Maybe adding more weaker Fusion Monster you can Fusion into instead of ""Meta Staples"" or stronger generic cards. Because even as a ""Pure"" deck, this deck can be really consistent and can still get out full combo of its Main ""Boss Monsters"" onto the field. You could replace the more generic support cards in the Main Deck for more copies of the ""in archetype"" cards or perhaps other, weaker generic support cards. But nothing really comes in mind without </span><span class=""cf0"">abosuletly</span><span class=""cf0""> ""bricking"" this deck.

The deck truly could not be beat in terms of power, consistency, and speed and could not ""brick."" (open up a poor opening hand) If you weren't also playing </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> during the time of its reign or specifically playing a deck that beat </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0"">, you were almost always going to lose.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""cf0"">The deck was also unique in being able to play during ""Turn 0"" aka during your opponent's turn and being able to set up its own powerful board alongside the opponent. And the deck was just too fast that the </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> player would probably already have a fully set up board and be able to interrupt your </span><span class=""cf0"">playings</span><span class=""cf0""> WHILE you were playing to set up your own board on YOUR TURN. They also had very little room for disruption as they could keep chaining their effects to each other, leaving very little breathing room and interaction windows for the opposing player to play against. Today, decks can now be seen also being able to play on their opponent's turn, but they still needed some form of starter or set up, so they can never have a ""Turn 0"" board and have a fully built board during the opponent's turn. (Decks like </span><span class=""cf0"">Dracotail</span><span class=""cf0""> can Fusion Summon on the opponent's turn and </span><span class=""cf0"">Labrynth</span><span class=""cf0""> can play a trap during the opponent's turn but not truly set up a full powered board from just a singular card WITHOUT even getting to their first official turn.)</span></p><p><span class=""cf0"">Many more modern decks (at the time of writing this, January 2026) can now probably compete with </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> in terms of power level and just how insanely broken and good decks have become. But this also could be attributed to how decks function nowadays and the power of individual cards as newer and more powerful cards are released to increase power-creep and get the people interested and entertained. With </span><span class=""cf0"">Kashtira</span><span class=""cf0""> and </span><span class=""cf0"">Maliss</span><span class=""cf0""> decks being almost full-blown counters to this deck as a whole as those decks mainly focus on Banishing as a mechanic. </span></p><p><span class=""cf0"">In terms on ""Unrestricted"" or ""Unlimited"" formats, there are probably more powerful decks out there nowadays that can fully utilize all the power of some of the most overpowered cards to ever exist (Such as <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=74191942"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/74191942.jpg"" data-card=""74191942"" data-name=""Painful Choice"">Painful Choice</span></a>, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=85602018"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/85602018.jpg"" data-card=""85602018"" data-name=""Last Will"">Last Will</span></a>, pre-</span><span class=""cf0"">errated</span> <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=26202165"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/26202165.jpg"" data-card=""26202165"" data-name=""Sangan"">Sangan</span></a><span class=""cf0""> and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=78010363"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78010363.jpg"" data-card=""78010363"" data-name=""Witch of the Black Forest"">Witch of the Black Forest</span></a>, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=79571449"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/79571449.jpg"" data-card=""79571449"" data-name=""Graceful Charity"">Graceful Charity</span></a>, and <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=55144522"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/55144522.jpg"" data-card=""55144522"" data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</span></a>) but even then, </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> can still stand on its own without any of those cards.

As stated before, the deck is a Graveyard and Fusion centered deck, with all the Main Deck </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> cards having effects when they are sent to the Graveyard by card effect. And you accomplish this by using many of the </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> card's ""mill"" effects (sending an X amount of cards from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard). The Main Deck Monsters also all having their own unique, powerful effects themselves, AND they all share a ""Fusion Summoning Effect"" when they are sent to the Graveyard by card effect; being able to Fusion Summon with materials in the Graveyard, field, or the hand. This means you are easily able to bring out the deck's 2 Main Boss Monsters without the need of a specific Fusion Spell like <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=24094653"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/24094653.jpg"" data-card=""24094653"" data-name=""Polymerization"">Polymerization</span></a>. Not only that, but they will also shuffle themselves back to the bottom of the deck or Extra Deck when they Fusion Summon using this effect, so they never truly ""leave play"" as you will be able to either draw into them later or send them to the Graveyard again to activate their effects.<br /><br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> is a strong but very hard deck to learn and master as it is very skill intensive and it involves A LOT of interaction between you and your opponent. It involves you knowing what your cards do, when to activate them at optimal times, how they can react to each other as well, and of course your match-ups and overall knowledge of what your opponent's deck might do also help </span><span class=""cf0"">tremendiously</span><span class=""cf0"">.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=""cf0"">An important sidenote I should say before getting into this is that all the </span><span class=""cf0"">Tearlaments</span><span class=""cf0""> Fusion Summoning effects are all ONCE PER TURN.

If Chimera Fusion or a way to Polymerization is drawn, Chimera Fusion can be set to fuse into Dragostapelia or Magnum the Reliever. Fusion Armament can provide an additional beast to use for fusions and can make a Mirror Swordknight in GY a live negate early into a combo. Buio is a fiend that can fuse into Luce after a full combo using fiends or fairies in GY. Diabellstar Vengeance's effect can summon Silvera on the opponent's turn or Poplar to quick synchro into Chengying on the opponent's turn, triggering Chengying's effect with various GY effects that banish for cost. Rciela is also an option that can serch for Effect Veiler if desired. Non-engine and side decks are merely samples and can be modified to fit a given meta, but fiends, beasts like Hop-Eared Squadron, or fairies like Lancea are appreciated.</p>"

With this incredible power, it's time to tear apart ladder with Albaz and his newfound friends! (I speak from personal experience, this is the deck I used to reach Masters 1 this season).<br /><br />These spellcaster dragons do relatively few actions for a lot of impact! Everytime you fusion summon with Dracotail monsters, can set a Dracotail spell/trap from deck, then get an additional effect which breaks your opponent's board, giving this strategy inherent board breaking capabilities. Dracotail Faimena can also fusion summon as a quick effect during the Main Phase, meaning you can fusion summon turn 0 and immediately start interrupting your opponent! This low amount of special summons Dracotail does allows it to perfectly play in Maxx ""C,"" creating a lot of advantage and interruptions while minimizing the amount of draws your opponent gets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Paired with Branded, Dracotail becomes near unstoppable! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! Phryxul is the perfect card to bridge both Branded and Dracotail decks! This strategy generates a ton of massive beatsticks on field, smashes through established boards with in-engine cards, and generates a ton of advantage! Albax and Phryxul has truly made the ultimate fusion strategy!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

Set whatever traps you may have. PaSs.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, VERY casual deck. Most cards will send a ""Red-Eyes"" monster to the Graveyard which you can bring back with many of your Trap Cards' effects and most of the ""good"" Red-Eyes cards will use ""burn"" strategies. <br />And a lot of the older cards depend on your opponent either attacking into them or doing something, so it's more so for very casual and slow paced Duels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall still, this deck can be very fun in very casual Duel and settings with your friends and even has an OP Boss Monster you can go into (<a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=37818794"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/37818794.jpg"" data-card=""37818794"" data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</span></a>) which you always swap out if you want to be more casual.

The deck mainly wants a lot of Monster cards in the deck in order to use as material for their Fusion Summons. The deck is very consistent and can run other engines in order to make it even more consistent, fuse into other powerful Monsters, or extend the capabilities of the deck.

Most turn 1 boards will be 2x Spirit Dragon, 1x True Light, one or two spell/trap disruptions (and sometimes a veiler in hand), and a Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon on the field if you are lucky. On average 4-5 disruptions/negates for your turn 1 board. Going second is trickier, so either hope to draw into hand traps or side deck Dark Ruler No More/Ultimate Slayer etc.</p><p>- Side deck is budget and meta-dependent.</p><p>- Neo-Kaiser Seahorse added as a quick and easy way to get out Snake-Eyes Vengeance Dragon, along with another way of targeting Maiden of White for the extra tuner/BEWD summon from the GY.</p><p>- You want to create 2x Spirit Dragon if possible, due to the toolbox of light synchro dragons you can tag into during opponent's turn. Note that opening with Maiden as the only starter will only yield 1x Spirit Dragon, but opening with Maiden + Neo-Kaiser Seahorse can yield 1x Spirit Dragon and 1x Snake-Eyes Vengeance Dragon. Also, opening with Maiden + Mausoleum will yield 2x Spirit Dragon (hence the inclusion of 3x Mausoleum).</p><p>- 3x White Stone of Ancients added as an easy discard target for Wishes, enabling board protection through an end of turn summoning of Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon from the deck. Can cut to 1x to add other hand traps if needed.</p><p>- 2x Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon (rather than 1x) added for greater consistency of White Stone of Ancients summoning Jet Dragon from the Deck (in case we open with Jet Dragon in hand). Can do with 1x Jet Dragon if you want to add other hand traps.</p><p>- 3x Primite Drillbeam is a superb and budget negate that works well with the deck even without the rest of the Primite Package.</p><p>- Ether Beryl not added, as the deck no longer has a consistent access to 2x normal summons (due to no Spirit with Eyes of Blue link monster), and having more options in your synchro/fusion/xyz toolbox seems better than adding extra summon enablers like Ancient Fairy Dragon. Kaibaman the Legend also not added for the same reason as Ether Beryl.</p><p>- 2x Wishes (rather than 1x) is optional, but having 2x Wishes allows for Bingo Machine to be a pseudo-starter (2/3 chance rather than just 1/3 chance of grabbing Wishes). This approach actually works considerably consistently, allowing the deck to have a total of 14 ""starters"" - going first, 8 of these (Sage, Piri, Wishes) yield 2x Spirit Dragon, 3 of these (Maidens) yield 1x Spirit Dragon and another Spirit Dragon/Vengeance Dragon if paired with Mausoleum/Neo-Kaiser Seahorse, and 3 (Bingo Machine) have a 2/3 chance of adding Wishes, or grabbing a Roar/Majesty/Destined Rivals/Jet Dragon.</p>"

We lost Harpie's Feather Storm, which was our main meta-relevant card, so the deck is substantially worse now. Until we get more support that doesn't make us go negative, this build is what has been working best for me. This deck loses to handtraps, so hopefully you draw well enough to bait one out. I do not consider this archetype competitive, but unfortunately I am attached to it since I have been playing it since 2013 so I keep trying to make it viable.</p><p>Harpie core is pretty standard, 3x Harpie Lady, 3x Channeler, 3x Perfumer, 3x Fire Blast, 3x Hysteric Sign are all mandatory in my opinion. 1-2x Harpist, 1x queen and 1x Oracle round out a few more names. 1x Hunting Grounds, 1x Feather Rest, 1x Feather Duster since they are searchable off of Sign. Alluring Mirror Split is debatable, but has been reasonable good for me and can be your secondary search off of Perfumer. You can run 2 or 3 Egotist. I like 3 because it is a card I prefer to see in my opening hand more often than not.</p><p>Channeller and Perfumer are your main normal summons. If they get negated hopefully you drew an extender. If you can bait out the interaction before resolving your Channeler and Perfumer effects that will give you the best chance to succeed.</p><p>Using 2x Swallow's Cowrie to improve consistency on getting the Harpie we need, but it is debatable. Haven't found a better option, and this is more efficient that Small World in Pure Harpies. 2x Unexpected Dai, free summon of a normal Harpie with minimal restrictions. Unexpected Dai plus an extender will get you to most of the extra deck.</p><p>1x Tempest is in there because mostly because I like it, but it does give us some recursion that isn't terrible and it can search Fire Blast while setting itself up in grave. Replaceable, but I do like it.</p><p>3x Forbidden Droplet as interaction, battle damage, and as an outlet to dump Hysteric Sign since this deck hemorrhages resources. I consider 3x to be mandatory, does a lot for the deck besides just a strong negation. You want to see this card.</p><p>3x Imperm because it has been the most consistently useful handtrap for me. Really strong. Side it out for more relevant handtraps depending on matchup.</p><p>1x Talent and 1x Called By, 1-of power cards.</p><p>1x Double Or Nothing! Absolute brick, card sucks. You do not want to draw this, you only want to search it off of Utopia Double. Allows you to swing for 10,000 with the Utopia Double setup.</p><p>I am not running Hysteric Party, not searchable, too slow, too vulnerable, and requires a discard. Can potentially give you a sacky big play, but it has almost always been irrelevant for me the last few years.</p><p>Extra Deck is flexible. I am also using the Utopia Double package again. I am not a huge fan of the Utopia Double package because it adds a brick, but with Feather Storm gone we need a way to win, and I have had some success with this package in this build of the deck. Very glass cannon and quite frankly it sucks, but it does give you a way to win a game with minimal resources and you would be surprised how often this steals games. The Accesscode Talker setup is pretty nice to have, and the Spiders allow for maximizing value of normal harpies. Harpie's Phantasmal can just about win games on it's own. 2x cyber slash because they are easy to make and are disruptive. You can also go with toolbox rank 4's like Chidori or Giant Hand.</p><p>The side deck I currently have is generic. Tune it for the meta you expect to play against.

Also, you can use Suprise to put Acroquey back in your field zone once they've flipped up Fairy, so you can get some extra pops when you quick synchro your Yummys.</p><p>Alternatively, if they pick the Archfiend, they take it face-down, and you get the Dragon, and you'll special summon it as part of Maker's effect. Dragon will search for Dungeon, which you'll activate and search Fairy with. You'll be able to special summon Fairy from your hand, and link one of them off into Linkuriboh, and get into combo from there. You'll lose out on the Fairy lock, but you'll get a free draw, and your opponent will have to discard a card once Archfiend flips up.</p>"

We lost Harpie's Feather Storm, which was our main meta-relevant card, so the deck is substantially worse now and I think a Primite engine works pretty well to give us back a bit of control. My pure build is still what I prefer, but that may just be nostalgia. </p><p>Harpie core is pretty standard, 3x Harpie Lady, 3x Channeler, 3x Perfumer, 3x Fire Blast, 3x Hysteric Sign are all mandatory in my opinion. 1x Harpist, 1x queen and 1x Oracle round out a few more names. 1x Hunting Grounds, 1x Feather Rest, 1x Feather Duster since they are searchable off of Sign. You can run 2 or 3 Egotist. I am running 2 in this build so we can keep the deck at 40, and it is searchable through Sign and Perfumer. If I cut Drillbeam down to 1 Egotist will go back to 3.</p><p>Channeller and Perfumer are your main normal summons. If they get negated hopefully you drew an extender. If you can bait out the interaction before resolving your Channeler and Perfumer effects that will give you the best chance to succeed. Ether Beryl is your other normal summon, and it gets you nto your Primite engine.</p><p>3x Lordly Lode, 2x Ether Beryl, and 2x Drillbeam is what I am currently using for my light primite engine. Drillbeam might go to 1. 3 Ether Beryl has felt like too much since the harpies need the normal summon as well, so 2 or 1 is probably correct.&nbsp;</p><p>3x Forbidden Droplet as interaction, battle damage, and as an outlet to dump Hysteric Sign since this deck hemorrhages resources. I consider 3x to be mandatory, does a lot for the deck besides just a strong negation. You want to see this card.</p><p>3x Imperm because it has been the most consistently useful handtrap for me. Really strong. Side it out for more relevant handtraps depending on matchup.</p><p>1x Talent and 1x Called By, 1-of power cards.</p><p>1x Double Or Nothing! Absolute brick, card sucks. You do not want to draw this, you only want to search it off of Utopia Double. Allows you to swing for 10,000 with the Utopia Double setup.</p><p>Extra Deck is flexible. I am also using the Utopia Double package again. I am not a huge fan of the Utopia Double package because it adds a brick, but with Feather Storm gone we need a way to win, and I have had some success with this package in this build of the deck. Very glass cannon and quite frankly it sucks, but it does give you a way to win a game with minimal resources and you would be surprised how often this steals games. The Accesscode Talker setup is pretty nice to have, and the Spiders allow for maximizing value of normal harpies. Harpie's Phantasmal can just about win games on it's own. 2x cyber slash because they are easy to make and are disruptive. You can also go with toolbox rank 4's like Chidori or Giant Hand.</p><p>The side deck I currently have is generic. Tune it for the meta you expect to play against. Gardala is there because it is a Wind and a kaiju. Little Knight, Chidori, and a second Hunting Ground are there when I side out the Utopia Double Package.</p><p>Some variant of a Primite Engine seems to be the most viable. Not sure on numbers yet. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

In the middle we have the extenders and bricks which are mandetory. And on the left we have the handtraps. This list is without Orthros because I think he isn't really needed. I linked a great Video (which I do not own) which goes into the details and combos without Orthros which explains everything. In the side there are cards which you can play in main (the first 4) and the rest is considerations for the side deck. I hope this helps !</p>

What once was just two of the Six Samurai structure decks and a few extra cards is now an incredibly potent and I believe tournament level deck. After a few of the first edits to actually make this semi-workable I actually made the mistake that led to this deck's name; I added Obelisk the Tormentor thinking the summoning power of the Six Samurai would make good tribute fodder for the Egyptian God Card. I was right about that, but I was wrong in thinking that Obelisk would really be a boon to this archetype.&nbsp;</p><p>The other great change made not too long ago was the addition of Secret Six Samurai Fuma to replace Shien's Squire as a Level 1 Tuner but also the addition of Secret Six Samura Hatsume.&nbsp;</p><p>The most recent changes are the addition of The Legendary Lord Six Samurai monsters and the Tactical Trainer and Anarchist Monk tuner monsters.&nbsp;</p>"

I think 2 Noma is good as well, since you can sometimes banish her using Haggard Lizardose to get a draw, or tribute her in a pinch for the mitsu stuff or ultra evolution pill.</p><p>The main objective is to get your deck as thinned out of non-GMX and Dinosaur cards as possible before you activate Applied experiment #55, and preferably stack some materials on top using Noma and/or Kimridge. The mills off of Zombie Vampire are helpful in this as well. So are the draws you can get from Dugares, Haggard Lizardose and potentially others.&nbsp;<br /><br />Chicken game obviously CANNOT prevent the loss of lifepoints, only damage. It is mainly there to thin out your deck even further - you can access it easily with Horned saurus, which you can also fuse into using Daneen if you don't get Kaito on the field from the hand. The deck is honestly pretty decent at getting material on board. Mitsu does what it always does, as do the generic dinos. The side deck is pretty much just there for the sake of it, better options surely exist.&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all, I think this is interesting, maybe a better deckbuilder than me can even make it somewhat viable. This was my first thought when I started to think of an archetype to combine with GMX, and while I was building this deck (I started before they had even revealed the final cards of 1st wave, lol), I saw others, much better players (like Joshua Schmidt) had also seen that there might be something, maybe not great, but playable here, so shout out to them!</p>"

The answer is no, but here's one anyway. The ace-monster of Seto Kaiba from the Duel Monsters era of the anime has received a frankly insane amount of support over the years, allowing its associated deck to be meta-viable several times throughout its lifespan, and although it has currently fallen off the current meta, I believe it has the potential to make a 2nd/3rd/4th comeback even with the explosive power of today's strongest decks lined up against it. Would this build be the key to its victory? I'll let you decide.</p><p>Now, I know you're looking at a 50 card Main Deck and thinking that this brew doesn't have a chance, but hear me out and let me explain my madness before you judge it too harshly. I promise there's a method to it all. Let's start with a quick breakdown of the supplementary engines involved in this build, those being Primite, Buster Blader, Metalmorph/Bystial, and Crimson Dragon.</p><ol><li>Primite: Unsurprisingly, an engine that was designed to support Normal Monsters is a no-brainer for a deck that revolves around the strongest Normal Monster in the game, and yet, the synergy between the two decks is so complete that you'd almost think that Konami designed one with the other in mind.<ol><li>Ether Beryl and Lordly Lode serve functionally the same purpose in the Deck, one searching the other which then searches the other cards in the engine. That said, it's arguable to say that seeing Ether Beryl in your opening hand is slightly better, given that if the search effect of either is negated or your opponent hits you with a Droll &amp; Lock Bird you can still use Ether Beryl to Link Summon into the Spirit with Eyes of Blue and continue on with your combo.</li><li>Drillbeam is undoubtedly the best search target once the engine's been established, allowing you to negate and banish any card on the field so long as you have a Normal Monster or a Primite monster in your hand/on the field...and given how easy this is to accomplish if you have True Light on the field, which in and of itself is exceedingly easy for the Deck just by going through normal combos, it's almost a guarantee that Drillbeam will be live once it's in your grip.</li><li>Although not quite as strong as Drillbeam, Roar is nonetheless a good option to search off Ether Beryl/Lordly Lode, allowing you to summon a Blue-Eyes White Dragon in situations where you need the extra body as well as disrupting your opponent with its GY effect.</li></ol></li><li>Buster Blader: Unlike Primite, Buster Blader doesn't seem to have been custom-made to work alongside Blue-Eyes, and yet, there are enough incidental synergies between the two archetypes that they do work well together.<ol><li>Because Buster Whelp is a Level 1 Light Tuner Dragon monster, it can be searched with the Normal Summon efffect of Sage, it can be extra Normal Summoned by the effect of Mausoleum, and it can be used as material to summon Spirit with Eyes of Blue, Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon and Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres, the latter two of which you ideally want on your final end board.</li><li>Speaking of the end board, the engine's main power duo, Buster Dragon and the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman, lock your opponent out of activating their monster effects on field and prevent all but Link Monsters from attacking, and can both easily be summoned off a single activation of Prologue, give or take a few steps.<ol><li>It should also be noted that, because you technically only require Prologue to get these two monsters out since neither Destruction Sword Memories or Dragon Destroyer Swordsman require Destruction Sword monsters as material, seeing Prologue in your opening hand is hardly an issue, as Blue-Eyes is more than capable of filling the GY with Dragons to use as Fusion material for DSM.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Metalmorph/Bystial: Unlike Primite and Buster Blader, the Metalmorph engine admittedly doesn't have as many synergies with Blue-Eyes; that said, there are enough to make it viable in the Deck, especially when it's coupled with the small Bystial package included in the list.<ol><li>Because Fullmetal Dragon requires a tribute of a Level 5 or higher Dragon, Blue-Eyes is able to fulfill this requirement, as are the Bystials, and adding it to the end board gives you an omni-negate that can't be targeted or destroyed by Monster or Spell effects.<ol><li>It should also be noted that, because Fullmetal Dragon sets Max Metalmorph directly from the Deck, it plays around both Ash Blossom and Droll &amp; Lock Bird, which is a nice bonus.</li></ol></li><li>Because the Bystials require Lights/Darks in the GY to banish, Blue-Eyes is also able to fulfill this requirement easily, as is Buster Blader by-the-by, if your opponent isn't playing a Light/Dark focused strategy, and becasue they are Dragons, they can also be used as material to summon Hieratic Seals.</li></ol></li><li>Crimson Dragon: Because of the ease of which Blue-Eyes can get Level 1 Tuners and Level 8 Dragons on the field, it is exceedingly easy to get two Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragons on the field, meaning that it's also exceedingly easy to set up Crimson Dragon and the associated powerhouses it entails.<ol><li>The main target for Crimson Dragon is Sifr Divine Dragon, using Ultimate Spirit Dragon as its target. Getting these two Dragons out represents an omni-negate and a Monster negate, and because Sifr Divine Dragon protects your cards from destruction once each, it prevents Ultimate Spirit from being destroyed by regular Spirit Dragon's effect during the End Phase and can protect your True Light from being destroyed on your opponent's turn, thus preventing a potential board wipe.</li><li>As a secondardy target, we have Abyss Dragon, which can use either Spirit Dragon or Lightstorm Dragon as its targets, and also represents and omni-negate on board.<ol><li>As a side-note, you can also just naturally summon Abyss Dragon if you have Buster Dragon on field alongside one of the Deck's many Level 1 Tuners, which is a nice additional bonus for its inclusion.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>With all of that out of the way, let's take a moment to talk about the Deck's game plan.</p><ol><li>As is, the Deck as three viable Normal Summons, those being Sage, Buster Whelp, and Ether Beryl.<ol><li>Because all three of these can be linked off for Spirit with Eyes of Blue, seeing any combination of two of these in your opening hand grants you access to Spirit Dragon at minimum, as well as opening up either full Buster Blader or Primite combos.<ol><li>As noted above, it isn't technically necessary to access the Buster Blader portion of the Deck if you have Prologue in your opening hand, meaning that in a ""Best of All Worlds"" situation, you would have that plus Sage and Ether Beryl in your opening hand to gain access to all three engines at the same time.</li><li>It should also be noted that, of the three, Sage is the best Normal Summon, as it grants you access to all of the Deck's other Tuners, all of which have powerful effects in their own right.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Alongside these, the Deck has three primary extenders that you either want in your opening hand or will need to search through your normal combos, those being Maiden, Wishes, and Kaibaman.<ol><li>Without a doubt, Maiden is the card you want to get access to as quickly as possible, making it the premiere target for Sage's search effect if you don't find it in your opening hand. Being able to place True Light on your field is paramount to the Deck's strategy, both as a way to search the Deck's powerfull Spell/Traps and to get a Blue-Eyes on field, while its Special Summon effects grant you access to both Syncrho and Link plays.</li><li>Much like Maiden, Wishes is a card you want to see as soon as possible, either in your opening hand or by searching it with True Light, as it is another card that grants you access to all of the Deck's myriad Tuners, while its GY effect will give your Blue-Eyes monsters targeting protection via Neo Ultimate Dragon.</li><li>Admittedly, Kaibaman isn't as crucial to the Deck as the other two extenders, hence why there's only a single copy in the list. That said, in hands where you already have access to Maiden, Kaibaman is a phenomenal search target off of Sage, as it can easily set up the Crimson Dragon line by getting an addition Blue-Eyes on the field and its GY effect can give you easy access to Jet Dragon if you don't already have it.<ol><li>The one downside of Kaibaman is that, being a Warrior instead of a Spellcaster, it cannot be used to Summon Spirit with Eyes of Blue; however, in scenarios where you have access to any of the Deck's other Tuners, this is hardly an issue, as you can simply use Kaibaman and the Blue-Eyes it summons to make Spirit Dragon and use your other Tuners for the rest of the combo.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Unfortunately, because your endboard is dependent on which parts of the Deck you see in your opening hand, it's difficult to definitively say what it should look like. At minimum...and if you don't get interupted...you should have a Spirit Dragon and a Hieratic Seal on field, alongside whatever engine parts you opened/searched throughout the combo. That said, the ceiling for this Deck is considerably higher, and with the right combination of cards in hand, you can end on a board that will leave your opponent with scant options if you go uninterupted. That combination: Sage, Prologue, Fullmetal Dragon, and Ether Beryl/Lordly Lode. Here's how the combo goes:<ol><li>Normal Summon Ether Beryl/activate Lordly Lode; search whichever one you didn't open.</li><li>Activate Lordly Lode/Normal Summon Ether Beryl; search Drillbeam.</li><li>Link off Ether Beryl for Spirit with Eyes of Blue; search Mausoleum.</li><li>Activate Mausoleum; activate effect to extra Normal Summon Sage; search Maiden.</li><li>Discard Maiden to place True Light.</li><li>Activate Mausoleum effect, target Sage/Spirit and send Blue-Eyes to the GY.</li><li>Tribute Spirit to Summon Blue-Eyes from the GY; Special Summon Maiden from the GY.</li><li>Activate True Light, placing Wishes from Deck.</li><li>Activate Wishes, discarding the 5th card in your hand; add Roar and add either Effect Veiler for insulation or Sage/Kaibaman for follow-up.</li><li>Banish Wishes from the GY, equipping Blue-Eyes with Neo Ultimate Dragon.</li><li>Activate Roar, summoning Jet from Deck.</li><li>Synchro Summon two Spirit Dragons, using all four monsters on field; tribute both Spirit Dragons, summoning Ultimate Spirit and Crimson Dragon; search Synchro Rumble with Crimson Dragon.</li><li>Activate Crimson Dragon, targeting Ultimate Spirit, and Summon Sifr Dragon.</li><li>Reveal Fullmetal Dragon to set Max Metalmoprh.</li><li>Set both Prologue and Drillbeam and pass turn; during the End Phase, Sifr Dragon protects Ultimate Spirit from being destroyed.</li><li>During your opponent's Draw Phase, activate both Prologue to Summon Buster Dragon by sending Buster Blader and Destruction Sword Memories and True Light to Summon Blue-Eyes from the GY; before leaving the Draw Phase, activate Destruction Sword Memories, banishing it, Buster Blader, and Spirit with Eyes of Blue to Summon Dragon Destroyer Swordsman.<ol><li>With all this on board, you have two omni-negates, one from Ultimate Spirit and one from Drillbeam; you have a monster negate from Sifr Dragon that stops any in hand effects, as well as built in protection for your True Light; you're negating all your opponent's on-field monster effects with Buster Blader/Buster Dragon, as well as putting everything they summon that isn't a Link monster to Defense; you have targeting protection for your Blue-Eyes, both from True Light and Neo Ultimate Dragon, and targeting protection for your Ultimate Spirit with Neo Ultimate Dragon; and if/when you've used Drillbeam, you can then use the Blue-Eyes on field to activate Max Metalmorph and Summon Fullmetal Dragon for another omni-negate.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>With all that said, the Deck isn't without its weaknessess.</p><ol><li>Droll &amp; Lock Bird: Although both Maiden and Fullmetal Dragon are able to play around this card, the Deck still wants to do a lot of searching between Sage, Buster Whelp, Ether Beryl/Lordly Lode, and Wishes, meaning seeing this card from your opponent will likely hamstring your combos; the recent semi-limit of the card might help with this issue slightly, and it's too early in the format to know if Droll will still be widespread, though chances are high that it likely will be.</li><li>The Mulcharmies (mostly Fuwalos): Because the Deck wants to Special Summon a lot, seeing a Mulcharmy dropped on you can be devastating, Fuwalos in particular though Meowls can be annoying too...Purulia isn't much of a hassle, since the Deck doesn't really Summon from hand besides the Bystials.</li><li>As stated above, the potential output of the Deck is almost entirely dependent on what halves of the Deck you see in your opening hand; likewise, although it's less likely to happen now after the introduction of Maiden, Wishes, and Spirit with Eyes of Blue, it is still possible for the Deck to live up to the ""Brick-Eyes"" moniker that plagued it for so many years before the latest structure deck, as there are a number of cards you almost never want to see in your opening hand outside of a very few, niche situations (i.e. Buster Blader, Destruction Sword Memories, Ultimate Fusion, Syncrho Rumble).</li></ol><p>All in all, the Deck is a lot of fun to play, and as I stated above, I think it could potentially still compete with the current meta if given the chance.</p>"

I'll think about maining it when i remember how to do optimal Tri-Brigade lines, for now Rugal in the extra deck is fine lmao.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to side out the Charmer cards in main (aside from Hiita since she's a synergistic searcher), I've included Nib and Impulse in the side deck. Haven't tested how much Impulse messes with the extra deck pieces, you can swap it out for a different piece of disruption if you need to. It should be fine though (Kerass withstanding).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Main reason i opted to build it this way is because if i'm going to go into my Charmer fusion monster, i don't want to get Drolled mid-combo. Its the biggest issue i have with the Crowley extender (especially since the new time rules incentivize running lingering floodgates like Droll), so i'd rather just hard draw the Spellbook or open with something else that's useful if i don't see it. But if I do see it in my opening hand, i'll be guaranteed to play through Droll since you'll only have to search your deck once to set up your end board. Aside from that, i chose Fire King as my main engine because it has a lot of tools to discard charmers in your hand if you draw any of them. That way if you open a charmer and the spellbook, you'll have a means of getting your charamer into the GY so that your spell will be live.</p>"

I still need to see how will I squeeze in new Dracotail fusion monster (Shaurus), maybe remove Mysterion for that one. Deck can be set to 40 if you really want to, but I think it's better to have a bigger list to see less of the 1-offs (RIP Ketu).

Understanding why the sideboard has a bunch of normal monsters in it as well as the actual decklist is what it is, requires you - the player - to understand key elements of the game that are often overlooked in the modern Yu-Gi-Oh space - as well as understanding what kind of deck that the opponent is playing.</p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong><br /><strong>In order to play this deck well, you have to read the types and elements of your opponent's deck, and accomidate the sideboard accordingly. This deck's power comes from utilizing the complete chromatic spectrum of elements to undermine your opponent's board state.<br /><br /></strong>To put it simply, each monster that has been chosen has been researched in that it accomidates a slot of the normal monster line-up. For example, is your opponent going DARK / LIGHT? Replace the corresponding monster elements in the deck. Is it a Blue-Eyes deck? (Light-Spellcaster) / (Light Dragon) Add Watttaildragon and Flame Manipulator. Predaplant or Traptrix?&nbsp; (Earth/Plant / Dark/Plant) --- Jerry Beans Man and Genex Controller.&nbsp;</p><p>The deck's main core takes care of the rest and remains static - all of which is intended and functions around Lvs 3 / 6 / 9<br />Each monster has been carefully researched to be put in this deck for maximum synergy. <br />There are 9 one-card starters in this deck. <br />There are 9 spot removal cards. All spot removals are reusable every turn.<br />There are 3 Hand Traps - That same hand trap also is a board wipe - and can be searched out by the Primite support.<br /><br />Draco Masters of the Tenyi is the Raigeki of the deck.<br />Lightstorm Dragon is your Harpie's Feather Duster.<br />First of the Dragons / First of the Dragonlords are your nigh-unbeatable walls that cannot be destroyed by battle by effect monsters and are unaffected by monster effects.<br /><br />All Primite Support powers up the normal monsters that you run. Lordly Lode's buffs your monsters by 300 for each normal monster in the grave, and Piercing the Darkness acts as an Honest-esque battle insurance and additional card draw.<br />And because of the type/element diversity, you can main deck ""There Can Only Be One"" instead of running Primite Roar and leave both Primite Roars in the sideboard.</p>"

That said, Cubics are a deck that do not function at all with this rule, or if they do, they end up as Crimson Nova turbo.

The MAN has certainly hit the mark in GENESYS! With it's recyclable trap negates, low point cost, slow control gameplay, 20+ staples and redundant consistency, Odion has become the format's #1 trap-based strategy!<br /><br />The Dominus cards like Songs of the Dominators, Dominus Purge and Dominus Spiral have excellent synergy with the deck, being trap cards and for the most part, don't limit the strategy with their activation drawbacks. They simultaneously fulfill the cost of your Odion engine (Treasure's of the King's search &amp; Anubis the Last Judge's summon) while hindering your opponent with devastating interruption!&nbsp;<br /><br />The Ishtar siblings are on a roll! First it was Ishizu's cards who was responsible for creating Yugioh's most powerful deck of all time - now it is Odion's turn to completely dominate GENESYS with this traps and serpents!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

They are all Rank 9 Xyz Monsters with over 3000 ATK who give the Deck some strong options during the Battle Phase and outside of the Battle Phase. Earth Slicer is a 3100 ATK monster who can detach any number of materials to target the same number of cards on the field and destroy them. Also, if it destroys a monster by battle, it can attach that monster to itself as material. Werewolf is a 3300 ATK monster who can attack a number of times up to the number of materials it has attached to it, and if your opponent activates a card or effect, it can Quick Effect detach a material to banish up to 1 card each from your opponent&rsquo;s field and GY if it is currently your turn or look at your opponent&rsquo;s hand and banish a card from it face-up until the End Phase if it is currently your opponent&rsquo;s turn. Ripper/Milennia is a 3100 ATK monster with piercing who can Quick Effect detach 2 materials when your opponent activates a monster effect to negate the effect and destroy all cards on the field. Out of those 3, Ripper/Milennia is the worst one because it is a 3100 piercer who just has a panic button that nukes the entire board. Earth Slicer is the most proactive out of the 3 because it can detach any number of materials and destroy the same number of cards on the field. But, it can also attach monsters it destroys by battle to itself as material, preventing your opponent from bringing that monster back from GY or banishment later while also giving it material to destroy more cards on your next turn. Werewolf is a reactive card that mainly banishes up to 1 card each from your opponent&rsquo;s field and/or GY, but it can make up to 2 attacks during the Battle Phase (given that it has 2 materials attached) while also having a 3300 ATK stat. Antimatter Dragon is a weird card. You can make it in Prediction Princess on Turn 3 or so in order to have a 4000 ATK beater who can declare up to 2 attacks on monsters. But, battle damage is halved if it still has material and you don&rsquo;t really benefit from being able to send a monster with the same Type as the detached monster from Deck to GY. Unless you need a 4k beater who can attack 2 monsters, either Werewolf or Earth Slicer would be better picks for this role.&nbsp; 2 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

Tip searches for a Runick card from Deck before banishing the top card of your opponent&rsquo;s Deck.&nbsp; Flashing Fire targets and destroys a Special Summoned monster your opponent controls before banishing the top 2 cards of your opponent&rsquo;s Deck. Slumber targets a face-up monster on the field and prevents it from being destroyed by battle or card effect the next instance it would be this turn, but it cannot attack and then you banish the top 3 cards of your opponent&rsquo;s Deck. Freezing Curses targets and negate the effects of an Effect Monster your opponent controls until the end of the turn and banishes the top 3 cards of their Deck. Destruction targets and destroys a Spell/Trap your opponent controls and then banishes the top 4 cards of their Deck. Dispelling, if your opponent adds a card(s) from their Deck to their hand, discards a random card out of their hand and then banishes the top 2 cards of their Deck. Smiting Storm banishes cards from the top of your opponent&rsquo;s Deck up to the number of cards they control. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;

Starving Venom Wing Dragon, if your opponent Special Summons a monster(s) face-up, can target 1 of them to gain ATK equal to that monster&rsquo;s ATK until the end of the turn and also negate its effects until the end of the turn. Also, when another card or effect is activated on the field, it can Quick Effect destroy a card on the field. Lastly, if it is destroyed while in the Monster Zone, you can place it in your Pendulum Zone where its Pendulum Effect is that it places a Predator Counter on all monsters that are Special Summoned to your opponent&rsquo;s field, turning them into Level 1 monsters if they are Level 2 or higher and have a Predator Counter on them. So, even if this card is destroyed by your opponent&rsquo;s or destroyed during the End Phase because of SoI&rsquo;s effect, you can still massively benefit from its Pendulum Effect. Caliga makes it so that while it is face-up on the field, each player can only attempt to activate 1 monster effect per turn and each player can only attack with 1 monster each Battle Phase. 1 </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;

Don't believe me? Check out my Youtube video below to see the deck in action!&nbsp;<br /><br />Experience the familiar dopamine high as you mill your entire deck to the graveyard, plussing a bazillion times like no tomorrow as you create an unbreakable board with the likes of Tearlaments Rulkallos (Summon negate), Tearlaments Cryme (Omni-negate shuffle), Tearlaments Sulliek (Monster negate), and Tearlaments Kaleidoheart (Target shuffle). <br /><br />This strategy also has access to a large synchro suite due to millable tuners as well as the Lightsworn engine! Genex Return Zero (Monster negate destroy for each attribute), Draco Berserker of the Tenyi (Monster banish), Juraishin (Monster of spell field wide destruction), Chengying (Monster banish) and Wolfrayet (Shuffle all monsters your opponent controls).&nbsp;<br /><br />The main weakness of this deck is bricking and getting unlucky with mills. However, once the milling gets going, almost nothing stops Tearlaments from winning the game, especially in the lower power fomat of GENESYS! The combination of Scheiren, Kitkallos, TearKash and Scream mill 14 cards! The Lightsworn cards can also mill quite a bit as well, with both Minervas milling 7 cards and Weiss milling 2! It's often that after you end your turn, you may have only about 5-10 cards left in deck due to how much you mill, search and draw!&nbsp;<br /><br />Tearlaments in GENESYS functions as usual, milling as much as possible with the combined effort of the Tearlaments and Lightsworn cards. Make impenetrable boards going first and power through everything with immense amounts of milling going second with pure engine!

You're usually setting Vadis off Karmael, because with her and Betrayal it's basically always able to get you two quick XYZs. This also makes Carpedivem playable to cut your opponent off the most important card in their combo, or can act as a pseudo-Mind Crush.</p>"

We turbo out Oneiros backed by hypnogogia, oneiromancy and phantasms which are all quite solid cards. After that we just play a ton of good generic cards which the deck can facilitate i.e. Chaos, Branded, Dogmatika, unchained and witchcrafter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What does this deck do?</p><p>It actually has some quite fun/ intresting things going for it in a more casual setting (though not even really playable in lower powered formats like Genesys). It has some interruption and protection mostly in oneiromancy, Verre and the extra deck. Between Albaz, The Fallen &amp; The virtuous, Unchained, Mirrorjade and the Vice madame- unchained Abomination - Oneiros shinnenigans the main selling point of this deck is that it can repeatedly eat and break entire boards given the circumstances where you get to a position where you can establish some level of end board prescence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall I don't think you can make much more of a dream mirror deck at the moment. You play enough dream mirror engine to get into Oneiros, your field spells and trap cards so you should really only play the number of dream mirror cards needed to get to that position then fill out the rest of the deck with options that can work with the dream mirror engine but does not directly compete with Neiroys normal summon slot and can compliment the dream mirror archetype and fix some of the issues with it. The deck is fun and very playable in a more relaxed casual setting but does not compete anywhere near any meta level</p>"

One of the coolest things about this archetype is the possibility of recycling Miscellaneousaurus back from the banishment zone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most interesting thing about these cards is the fact that they are Level 8 Light and Dark attribute Fusion Monsters. This provides easy access to Rank-8 monsters, for example, Dragluxion to access Tachyon Transmigration, which is the counter trap for Galaxy-Eyes, a ridiculously strong counter trap because it negates all activated effects in the chain, returns the cards on the field to the deck, and can also be activated from the hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are also other cards you can make, such as Number 38, or Dingirsu to protect your field from destruction effects. In a format where the best deck is Branded Dracotail, using the counter trap makes perfect sense because it negates all the effects of the infinite chain link that is made from a single Fusion Summon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And since these cards bring more monster spam to the dinosaur's end board, you can always make A Bao A Qu, which is an excellent Link-4 that can extend your plays, pop opponent's cards, and be an excellent follow-up on the next turn.</p><p>I will demonstrate the test hands below in the 60-card version, which is very consistent with the addition of the GMX monsters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hands</strong></p><p>Below I will show 1 test hand with Princess, and then the other 9 combos are all using A Bao on the end board. Put the continuation link in the duelingbook dot com /</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 1: (Promethean Princess version)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78547948</p><p>End Board: Tyranno + Phoenix + Dolkka + Velox /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + Promethean Princess + GMX Researcher Selande /Banished: Omega</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This combo is interesting and makes sense because the Researcher is a Fire attribute, but the fact that you're locked in while Princess is on the field takes away some of the synergy between the engines, since the deck is made up of monsters of different attributes. In this case, you would have to use Hiita in the extra deck as well.</p><p>I tested this version, and it's good considering it's more resilient against blind second cards like Dark Ruler No More, but I prefer the version with A Bao. Even the follow-ups with A Bao are better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 2: Miscellaneousaurus + Petiteranodon + Kimridge (A Bao version)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78551562</p><p>End Board: Dingirsu + A Bao + Dolkka + Velox /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + Kimridge</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cool thing about this combo is that I managed to use Dugares to draw Ground Xeno and send it to the GY. With that, I was able to banish it and make Velox along with Dingirsu. This situation happens quite often.</p><p>Since I also drew Lost World, I activated it and managed to generate the token. It was convenient to bring Pankratops with the Pill to pop the token and bring Daneen from the deck to make the end board perfect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 3: Lithosagym + Petiteranodon + 1 Dino</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78551255</p><p>End Board: Wyvern + Chimera + Dolkka + Tyranno + Linkuriboh + (Pankratops) /in GY: nothing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here I set a spell to pop with the Wyvern's effect so as not to lose bodies on the board. Then I saw that it's possible to pass with Wyvern + Chimera on the field, and on the opponent's turn use Tyranno pop Chimera to trigger Wyvern's effect to bring Raptor from the deck and pop 1 opponent's card without targeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 4: Archosaur + Petiteranodon + GMX Applied Experiment #55</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78550619</p><p>End Board: Dingirsu + A Bao + Dolkka + Velox /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + Kimridge</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ERROR: Thinking Daneen is a GMX when using Experiment #55. It should have continued digging until it found a GMX.</p><p>This is where the cool interaction between A Bao and Kimridge comes in. You use A Bao to bring it out, return Misc to the whole deck, and use Velox to excavate Misc and add it to your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 5: Miscellaneousaurus + Babycerasaurus (Full Combo)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78548790</p><p>End Board: Dingirsu + A Bao + Dolkka + Velox /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + Kimridge + Kaiju Slumber</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this combo I used Daneen for Fusion Summon and used a Dinosaur from my hand for the Fusion Summon of Velox. This way, I managed to keep Daneen's body on the field to perform A Bao and then Dingirsu.</p><p>Note: Don't forget that you will have to skip the Draw Phase on your return because of Dugares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 6: Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus (Full Combo)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78558937</p><p>End Board: Dingirsu + A Bao + Dolkka + Velox /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus + Kimridge</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cool thing about this end board is that you can use A Bao to bring Kimridge from the GY, activate its effect, and stack the top of the deck with Miscellaneousaurus.</p><p>Then you use Velox to dig up Miscellaneousaurus and add it to your hand, so you start your next turn with A Bao mulliganing, and have Miscellaneousaurus to protect the dinos in main phase 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 7: Ground Xeno + Babycerasaurus (Scrap Raptor Combo)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78558138</p><p>End Board: Dingirsu + A Bao + Dolkka + Little Knight /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus</p><p>Can't access Daneen because you need to use the 3 Babycerasaurus first. But I was lucky with the draws with Dugares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I could have done much better on this endboard if I had realized to use the Fusion Summon effect of Ground Xeno in the GY. Then I could have used Velox with Allos and Miscellaneousaurus.</p><p>And used A Bao to bring Allos back to then use Dingirsu.</p><p>Improved Endboard: Dingirsu + A Bao + Dolkka + Velox /in GY: Miscellaneousaurus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Test Hand 8: Miscellaneousaurus + Petiteranodon</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>replay?id=813757-78557672</p><p>Endboard: A Bao + Dolkka + Tyranno + Linkuriboh /in GY: nothing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Detail: this combo can be improved with Kaitoptera instead of Dogoran.

For the purposes of this deck the extra deck is primarily centered on negates and destruction effects.</p><p>The deck itself is a bit bricky at times but can with the pot cards kind of cycle back your rituals from the GY meaning the deck has incredible and somewhat consistent burst potential. It fails to keep up with the modern meta game mostly due to the fact that it struggles to do anything outside of your turn with very limited interactions outside a few quick effects and quick play spells relying a lot on getting the value of your rituals on summon and mostly ending on quite generic extra deck end board pieces with maybe one or two of your rituals. The deck is however quite good at destruction and otks going second.</p><p>Fun deck to play casually but has a few to many weaknesses and issues to really be playable in more competetive settings.&nbsp;</p>"

The idea is that you don't need to invest points in to the spirit stuff and seventh tachyon can be used to search any exosister or goblindbergh depending on the situation. The test hands have proven capable. I really really like macro in this deck I think drawing it is just unbelievably strong especially in this format. I didnt include a side deck because I think it depends on the event and I havent come up with a single end-all side list that I would go with currently. Fun stuff. The onomat stuff has felt so good. Onomatokage's second effect is surprisngly dope in this strategy and adds a lot of grind game. If the points on onomatopaira are ever laxed in the future i would consider dropping the tachyon package to play gagaga girl and unbreakable xyz barrier bc i think that would be a bit more consistent and frankly better. All around i love this deck and the new support feels so unbelievably good to play. WIll attach a decklist video to this at some point. Enjoy :)&nbsp;</p>

Meanwhile you can continue summoning the Apophis Trap Monsters (due to being treated as Normal Monsters) and revtrieve them from the GY with Divine Serpent Apophis unimpeded.<br /><br />If you don't draw Tyrant's Throes, you're still likely to set up Naturia Exterio plus multiple monster negates via Apophis the Swamp Deity and Infinite Impermenance, as well as other interrupts / destructions.<br /><br />In order to easily summon Mystical Beast of Serket to get to Naturia Exterio via Temple of the Kings, its best to summon The Man with the Mark using a Vernusylph monster to discard and then revive it to preserve your Normal Summon. You can also discard Mystical Beast of Serket and revive it the same way, or send it with Awakening Forests and revive it with another Vernusylph. Both maindeck Serket monsters can be searched by Misting Seedlings. Remember to summon Apophis the Serpent with Temple of the Kings before summoning Naturia Exterio.<br /><br />You can also run Gallant Granite over Bagooska. In this instance, include Lord of the Heavenly Prison in the main deck (maybe swap it for one of the Tyrant's Throes). This is less permanent a lock but it lets you search Tyrant's Throes more easily and it only needs to be up for around 1 turn anyway.</p>"
