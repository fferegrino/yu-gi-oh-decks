They're nice and inexpensive. Secretary is an easy way to make a big play. I mostly use it to trigger Zeroboros, but it's also handy for making a Mirage or just general use as an extender. I only run 2 because it's a ""once per turn"" effect. Formud can bring out Splash Mage and make Zeroboros on its own, then you can trigger the effect by special summoning something. Even by itself, it's a decent 1 card combo. I only run 2 because I only have 3 targets for it.</span>  <span>Hopefully</span> Accesscode Talker <span>gets reprinted soon; it's currently way too expensive for a budget deck. I'd take out</span> Borrelsword Dragon <span>for it. I'd also consider removing Veiler</span> <span>for Impermanence. If you wanna play a more traditional build you can take out some of the combo cards for hand traps, but some of the best ones are kinda expensive. Ghost Ogre is an option. </span>  <span>I'm not using</span> Pot of Desires <span>because while it may be a great card, it can screw up my combos by doing stuff like banishing Gazelle.</span>  <span> </span><span>So yeah, it's a decent build priced at less than $130 on TCGPlayer.</span>  <span>I'd love to hear some budget-friendly picks for the side deck.</span>"

""Aliens"" have been around for quite some time but also received support on a semi-regular basis, which the newest members of the archetype making an appearance in <em>Dawn of Majesty</em>. Straightaway, ""Aliens"" are nowhere near competitive but still manage to be an interesting and versatile archetype if you take the time to get to know their effects.</p> <p>For more summoning power right from the start, I decided to run three copies of the ""Alien"" Normal monster ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper"">Alien Shocktrooper</a>"", which not only comes with sizeable stats but is also very helpful with the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Rescue Rabbit"">Rescue Rabbit</a>"" to setup for Rank 4 and Link-2 options. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Ammonite"">Alien Ammonite</a>"" are also very helpful due to being Level 1 Tuner monsters that can revive Level 4 or lower ""Alien"" monsters from the graveyard when Normal Summoned, therefore allowing for the same Link-2 summon as well as giving you the option to summon your archetypal Level 5 Synchro monster. Two ""<a data-name=""Alien Dog"">Alien Dog</a>"" give the deck yet more swarming and provide the special resource of the ""Alien"" archetype: A-counters. Said counters can also be distributed by two copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Stealthbuster"">Alien Stealthbuster</a>"" as well as two ""<a data-name=""Alien Overlord"">Alien Overlord</a>"", the first one being often used as discard fodder or being sent to the graveyard directly from the deck, while the other one serves as a solid beater that is Special Summoned using A-counters and can also distribute them on the field. One ""<a data-name=""Alien Telepath"">Alien Telepath</a>"" serves as archetypal backrow removal in the Main Deck.</p> <p>I also included a small ""Reptilianne"" engine (shoutouts to Loukas Peterson for the original idea), which allows for more searches, swarming, removal and stat reduction. Three ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"" are fantastic monsters to work with due to summoning themselves for some life points while also lowering an opposing monster to 0 ATK, and play well into the Extra Deck in form of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Echidna"">Reptilianne Echidna</a>"", which searches for the number of 0 ATK monsters. One ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Vaskii"">Reptilianne Vaskii</a>"" can be used as a Reptile-type ""Kaiju"" option that comes with 2600 ATK and a destruction effect. The only other Reptile in the deck is ""<a data-name=""Danger!? Tsuchinoko?"">Danger!? Tsuchinoko?</a>"" due to being extremely helpful when either effect triggers.</p> <p>The backrow has plenty of setup to work with: Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Mausoleum of White"">Mausoleum of White</a>"" might seem out of place, but give ""<a data-name=""Alien Ammonite"">Alien Ammonite</a>"" another option to enter the field via Normal Summon, triggering its effect. The copy of ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" searches the Field Spell for more consistency, while one copy of ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>"" can recycle monsters from the graveyard for further plays. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""&quot;A&quot; Cell Recombination Device"">""A"" Cell Recombination Device</a>"" serve as setup and search, while the three ""<a data-name=""Code &quot;A&quot; Ancient Ruins"">Code ""A"" Ancient Ruins</a>"" give the deck yet more Special Summoning from the graveyard. The one ""<a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>"" serves as protection against handtraps and the like while three copies of ""<a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>"" can give you a shot at disarming the opposing board when going second. The Traps are just one copy of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>"" and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a>"" to hinder the opponent, while two copies of ""<a data-name=""Mass Hypnosis"">Mass Hypnosis</a>"" are certainly more questionable/situational, but absolutely hilarious if you get them off.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features two copies of ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Fortress Gol'gar"">Cosmic Fortress Gol'gar</a>"", the Level 5 ""Alien"" Synchro monster with is overall easy to summon, big stat-wise and helpful in terms of effects for multiple reasons. One ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Hydra"">Reptilianne Hydra</a>"" is included as a situational choice, but also fairly easy to summon due to ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Lamia"">Reptilianne Lamia</a>"" and any Level 4 ""Alien"" building into the monster. One copy of ""<a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a>"" serves as a searcher for scenarios in which Link Summoning is not available, one ""<a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>"" can draw cards as well as revive ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper"">Alien Shocktrooper</a>"", and one ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" is included as the usual graveyard counter. On the Link front, we have two copies of ""<a data-name=""Reptilianne Echidna"">Reptilianne Echidna</a>"" for the aforementioned reason, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame"">Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame</a>"" as a powerful A-counter spreader and basically a Reptile ""<a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>"" on legs, two copies of ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll"">Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll</a>"" for all the amazing effects it provides, one copy each of ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Cerberus"">Knightmare Cerberus</a>"" for removal and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>"" if you want to throw the strategy out the window and just kick with a Link-4 beater.</p> <p>When I first started working with the ""Alien"" archetype, I was kind of annoyed by the fact that a lot of their cards do not make clear what the overall gameplan is supposed to be. However, now that I have taken the time to study them a little bit more, I have to say that they are a fun archetype that is quite unique amongst the various archetypes in the game. There are also various other versions and cards that one can use to build an ""Alien"" deck, for example by using the ""Ogdoadics"" as the backbone of the deck.

Description:  Magistus has been a deck that has been out since Genesis Impact. Taken to be the worst deck of the set (and rightfully so), it has yet to make a impact on the meta. With the introduction of Zoroa, The Magistus Daimon to the deck in BODE, the archetype has finally gained a good consistent 1st turn board. The goal of course, is to end on Zoroa with multiple equips attached to lock the opponent out of the game. Then on the next turn, set up negates or end the game with Accesscode.  Let's go through the list together:  Magistus Engine: x20  3 Verre: This card is our S/T searcher for the deck. (Also has an effect to bring down material from the banish zone). Verre allows us to grab our extenders and is one of the best cards to grab off Artemis for the next turn play (that being if you already have a way to end on Zoroa). Also has a banish effect to equip more Magistus cards from GY (important for more ED locking and/or extension plays).  3 Zoroa: The tuner of the deck. Drawing him allows you to go into Zoroa under 5 summons or Borreload Savage early on. Typically your revive target off of Vitra but a necessary card of the combo.  Can also serve as a proper starter by attaching Artemis and grabbing a needed card.  3x Endymion: The more barebones starter of the deck. Does everything that you would want from it. Typically, you'll be attaching Artemis to start off your plays and/or Ninanruru/Rilliona to play thru the opp board. It's also a decent hand fixer.  3x Crowley: Our extender of the deck. Does nothing by itself but is important to have as it serves as one of the main ways you'll get to Zoroa.  Also has the same effect as Verre.  3x Vitra: Our monster reborn for the archetype. A card that you'll be grabbing off of Rilliona on the follow-up turn or an extender to end on your intended board. Also has a Magistus equipped protection effect that is important for keeping the lock in place.  3x Trismagistus: One of the best cards in the archetype. Serves as a soul charge from the hand and another way to extend your plays. Also has a nice battle protection effect for magistus cards equipped with an extra deck card. Really good card.  2x Theurgy: One of the most ""cuttable"" parts of the list. It serves as another way to attach Artemis or play thru opponents boards. Especially important in a meta with effect veiler/imper as it allows our cards to still get to full combo thru interruption. Also serves as a type of interruption on the opp turn by attaching an extra ED monster to your magistus monsters.  Starters:  Rilliona, Zoroa, Endymion  Extenders:  Crowley, Trismagistus, Vitra, Theurgy  More ""Generic Cards"": x8  2x Spell Power Mastery. A useful card that allows us to search for Endymion. This card allows us to get to our starter even if we don't draw it. Ran only at 2 because we really don't want to draw more then one.  1x Called by the grave: Pretty self-explanatory. Allows you to negate a handtrap or serves as a interruption on opp turn.  2x Cosmic Cyclone: Flex spot of the deck but it's always nice to have more S/T removal.  3x Triple Tactics Talent: This card can easily be switched for Desires. Due to the nature of this deck being able to combo with basically any two card hand, TTT serves as more of another extender drawer or board breaker for going second.  Hand-Traps: (What - we're playing YGO in 2021 aren't we?) x12  3x Ash Blossom  3x Effect Veiler  3x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  3x Infinite Impermanence  Standard selection of HTs. It's important to recognize that Effect Veiler and Droll are both spellcasters. Meaning that they can link into Artemis to start plays or be discard fodder for Crowley.  Extra deck:  2x Artemis - the best equip card that the deck has. It allows the search for any of our Magistus monsters that we need in hand.  1x Ninanruru - Our S/T removal other then cosmic. Can be useful to force activation of cards. Also has a nifty effect to allow two attacks on monsters.  1x Vahram - The main target to equip to Zoroa. Gives Zoroa a construct-like send and S/T protection. Also has a boardwipe effect that burns all face-up cards. Just like the fiery bird it is.  1x Aiwass - Our target for Fusion matchups. Can also be made with Invocation in matchups that don't use the ED. Don't forget the atk/def gain effect to hit over monsters.  2x Rilliona - Typically the card that allows the search for baby Zoroa. Allows us to consistently go into Zoroa. Remember that this card locks us into Magistus ED monsters. Also has a neat effect to negate a monster on your turn.  1x Zoroa, the Magistus of Daimon - Our main t1 board usually revolves around him. Important to realize that Zoroa says the cards don't have to be attached to him to do the floodgate effect and that Zoroa works no matter where the ED monster attempts to activate. Also has a neat reincarnation effect that becomes useful for plays later on and to reestablish the lock. Can be ran at 1 or 2 - up to your preference.  1x Borrel Savage - Omni negate that can be made t1 to play around Nibiru if you have full combo or be made in matchups that don't use the ED. Also a neat target on later turns for more negation.  1x Bahmaut Shark/1x Toadally Awesome - fans of this deck already knows about these cards. You typically make this with Endmyion and Crowley (by changing Crowley to water). Another play to play around Nibiru or to have another negation on the board.  1x Halq/Selene/Accesscode - Standard Accesscode link climb combo. Make Halq with Zoroa and another monster then SS Veiler. Then link into Selene and revive another spellcaster. Then go into Accesscode. Typically the play that you will do to end the game.  1x Dragite - Honestly, this is the flex spot of the deck. Choose whatever you would like to run in this spot. Running Dragite just for another S/T negation when I can't get a link in GY for Savage. Pick whatever  you would like for this spot.  Side Deck:  Meta dependent but to explain choices:  1x Magistus Invocation - Now you might be asking, why are you running this card in the side? Well, to be honest typically you won't be ending on Aiwass with Invocation in the deck as you would have to search invocation off Rilliona. The problem with that is that if you have the search for Rilliona, typically you'll be looking to grab ways to break boards or extend. The card itself serves as a brick in the starting hand and does nothing for us in the way for extension. In testing this deck, I rarely grabbed this card and loathed the times it was in my starting hand.  3x Secret Village - We're a spellcaster deck so might as well run one of our good support cards. This card + Zoroa can often lead to unbreakable boards. Good for locking your opp out of Spell cards.  1x Cosmic - to finish off the 2 in the MD  1x Feather Duster - Good S/T wipe card.  Of course, change what you would like in the SD. All up to the players preference.  Finale: As explained earlier, most 2 cards in the deck lead to ending on Zoroa. That means that you will be able to consistently end on the ED lock. This list intends to end on that board thru multiple disruption.  Basic Combo with Rilliona and any other Magistus Spellcaster:  NS Rilliona -&gt; grab Trismagistus -&gt; Activate Tris -&gt; SS Spellcaster -&gt; XYZ into Rilliona -&gt; Activate Rilliona (Detach Rilliona Spellcaster) SS Zoroa -&gt; Zoroa Effect Attach anything (Typically something you don't want to equip with Zoroa T1 like Ninanruru (or if you don't want to lock out Links something you do want to attach) -&gt; Zoroa effect to revive -&gt; Syncro into Daimon -&gt; Effect Daimon to attach -&gt; Rilliona GY effect to attach to Magistus monster  (Typically you'll attach the Link to the Rilliona XYZ. Reasoning being that Tris will give Rilliona one BP protection now and you'll force your opp to deal with both Zoroa and Rilliona or else you'll get value on the following turn off both Artemis and XYZ).  Of course, this is one of the many combos that lead to full combo. This deck doesn't really have one exact play to establish the lock (thou it'll typically involve the XYZ).  Strengths:  Consistent - most two card hands get to combo (more so if you have a starter)  Can play thru multiple disruption.  Can outright win some games.  Weaknesses:  Nibiru (If you don't get to a negate before Nibiru (which some hands can - make sure to think out your plays!))  Board Breaker cards like DRNM.  Decks that focus on Main Deck monsters.  Anyways, that wraps up this post. Feel free to comment suggestions! This deck has many different variations, so any tips is appreciated! Thank you for reading my post and have a nice day.

The deck is build out of two engines:  <strong>1. Sacred Beast part:</strong> <ul>  	<li>This engine is there to put big boys with protection on the board. I did choose Hamon since it is the best standalone monster out of the trio. Also, its support card <a data-name=""Cerulean Skyfire"">Cerulean Skyfire</a> is searchable with Curious and adds a nice interruption to your end board.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Opening of the Spirit Gates"">Opening of the Spirit Gates</a><a> is the strongest card of the engine. It searches every other peace you are are missing (except for Skyfire). It recycles </a><a>Cerulean Skyfire AND even Cursed Eldland if needed. And it also helps to make combo plays. </a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""Fallen Paradise"">Fallen Paradise</a><a> delivers the needed protection for your Hamon. It also generates a +2 every turn, if not dealt with by your opponent.</a></li> </ul> <strong>2. Eldlich part:</strong> <ul>  	<li>This part is here for the grind game.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Eldlich the golden Lord"">Eldlich the golden Lord</a><a> is central for the engine to work and delivers in addition a level 10 body with whom you can go into either </a><a>Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max or </a><a>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos.</a></li>  	<li>Most of the trap cards can be used as cost for other parts of the deck and can float out of the graveyard.</li> </ul> <strong>Notable Generics:</strong> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Magician's Souls"">Magician's Souls</a><a> is a broken card which can draw you two cards and by the way get your Eldlich engine rolin'.</a></li>  	<li><a data-name=""E&lt;a&gt;xodius the Ultimate forbidden Lord&lt;/a&gt;"">E</a><a>xodius the Ultimate forbidden Lord</a><a> is the target for Souls, can be a level 10 body for Link or Xyz plays and helps to recycle your monster cards.  </a></li> </ul> The deck has problems going second and is overall not perfect, but I like the synergy between the two archetypes.  I would love to own this deck IRL, but a lot of cards are very expensive, so it won't happen in a foreseeable future...  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

Your main starter is either going to be Mo Ye, as he can one-card synchro into Chi Xiao which gives you a search AND Mo Ye draws you a card on synchro summon, or Eccclesia, who can tribute herself to special summon Mo Ye, and start your combos from there.  The D/D engine is in here to go into Halqifibrax plays and to dig deeper into the synchro pool, however, it's not as consistent as just the Swordsoul engine is. When it goes off, you can end on some devastating boards, but if you prefer to use a pure Swordsoul engine, the side deck is catered to taking out the D/D engine, and just using generic handtraps and removal.  &nbsp;  There Can Be Only One is a great tech option for games two and three, as your ideal end board will have no more than one type of monster on the field, and can completely shut down monotype archetypes you may be facing."

Can be played going second and first. Very flexible extra/main deck.","Pros:  Equally strong, regardless if you go first or second. Can play through multiple negations. Non-linear combo options. Does not rely on normal summon. Extremely consistent. Builds a board with 2-4 interruptions. Multiple removals during combo, including non-targeted banish, double shuffle, destructions and other. Very simple in terms of rulings understanding. Fits both TCG and OCG banlist for online play. Generates hand advantage.  Cons:  Many meta and anti-meta decks with floodgates hit it really hard. Because:  It is tightly bound to WYRM archetype, and has to be played around it. It requires the GY. It locks you to Synchro summoning. All your tuners are water normal monsters."

No, I haven't justified ordering Adjusted Gold/Malicious Bane yet (I pray that KoMoney gives them a reprint) I've been huntin' fer Increase and Faris, hopefully without having to pay full price. I eagerly await for Destroy Pheonix Enforcer, as I have sided Fusion Destiny in anticipation.  I'm thinking of swapping Pheonix Enforcer + his materials for Thunder Giant, so Grandmerge has 2400 as opposed to 1800 with Burstinatrix/Avian.

The core of the deck is still the same, summon Archfiend Empress and float with her effect and the Dark Spirit monsters, only this time we are combining them with an Unchained engine. Unchained cards, such as Unchained Twins - Aruha and Abominable Chamber of the Unchained, are in this deck to boost the early game power by setting up Unchained Soul of Rage interruptions, whilst also providing some nice destruction synergy.  <strong>Deck playstyle:</strong> Beatdown  <strong>Core cards:</strong> Archfiend Emperor, Archfiend Empress, Dark Spirit of Malice, Dark Spirit of Banishment  <strong>Gameplay:</strong>  You want to dump your fiends into the grave as soon as possible so that you can revive them from there later. You mainly summon during the opponent's turn to pressure them into outing your monsters, which depletes their resources whilst also providing you with a fairly powerful wall. Archfiend Empress in combination with a Dark Spirit is a decent loop of protection!  In addition to that, you have access to the fairly unique method of removal via the Unchained cards. Unchained Soul of Rage and Unchained Soul of Disaster provide removal through using your opponent's monsters as material for link summons! Also, monsters such as Knightmare Unicorn provide more interruptions  Masterking Archfiend is a great card that can give you access to additional Archfiend Heiress searches, and has a maintenance cost! This means you can choose to remove it, which is useful if your opponent is using that pesky Mystic Mine..."

The strategy is also known as ""Cure Burn"".","<p>This is my take at building a ""Fire Princess Burn"" deck, which is also referred to as ""Cure Burn"". The main card to use in this strategy is obviously ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"", a Level 4 monster that inflicts 500 damage to the opponent whenever you gain life points. This means that you normally need sixteen ticks of healing with ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"" around to inflict lethal damage to the opponent, which is certainly a more casual-oriented strategy to use, but one that can be fun to work with. But due to the age of the strategy, there are various older cards that do not necessarily see play anymore in other decks.</p> <p>The monsters are quite simple: We use three copies of ""<a data-name=""UFO Turtle"">UFO Turtle</a>"" as the searcher to fetch us one of the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"". Granted, ""<a data-name=""UFO Turtle"">UFO Turtle</a>"" is a battle searcher and the entire idea of battle searchers rotated out of the interest of players a few years ago, but it certainly helps via blocking attacks, searching the necessary monster and keeps the deck very budget-friendly even for a casual deck. The last triplet comes in form of three copies of ""<a data-name=""Golden Ladybug"">Golden Ladybug</a>"", which passively heals during the Standby Phase and therefore gives us a slow but recurring trigger for the effect of ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"".</p> <p>There are quite a few more Spell cards to talk about, since three copies of ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" can make quite the difference in the game by spamming this card type. Three ""<a data-name=""Ancient Leaf"">Ancient Leaf</a>"" can trigger ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" while also making use of the added life points for more draw power, three ""<a data-name=""Goblin Thief"">Goblin Thief</a>"" are a dream card to use with ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"" due to supporting both the burn strategy via healing as well as inflicting damage on its own, three ""<a data-name=""Ledger of Legerdemain"">Ledger of Legerdemain</a>"" can fetch more of the necessary cards via draw and the deck is able to stall enough to make that work, three ""<a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>"" are further stall options and also give a ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" trigger, two ""<a data-name=""Child's Play"">Child's Play</a>"" help protecting ""<a data-name=""Fire Princess"">Fire Princess</a>"" while providing more healing for the ""Cure Burn"" strategy, three ""<a data-name=""Cauldron of the Old Man"">Cauldron of the Old Man</a>"" provide constant healing/burning, three copies of ""<a data-name=""Dark Sanctuary"">Dark Sanctuary</a>"" provide further protection while also inflicting damage, one ""<a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a>"" serves as a fourth draw for ""<a data-name=""Dark Sanctuary"">Dark Sanctuary</a>"", one ""<a data-name=""Poison of the Old Man"">Poison of the Old Man</a>"" serves as more healing/burning, one ""<a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>"" against pesky backrow and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Magical Mallet"">Magical Mallet</a>"" to shuffle unnecessary cards away while also providing another ""<a data-name=""Spell Absorption"">Spell Absorption</a>"" tick.</p> <p>The Trap cards are fairly straightforward: Two copies of ""<a data-name=""Bye Bye Damage"">Bye Bye Damage</a>"" can kill the careless opponent when running one of your monsters over, while two copies of ""<a data-name=""Wall of Disruption"">Wall of Disruption</a>"" can lower them far enough to be a non-threat to your health points and for them to take additional damage due to running into a higher ATK monster. The Extra Deck is only really filled with options that could be potentially made, with cards like ""<a data-name=""Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer"">Castel the Skyblaster Musketeer</a>"" to work against opposing monsters that block your strategy, while ""<a data-name=""Gagaga Cowboy"">Gagaga Cowboy</a>"" can be used to inflict another 800 damage and therefore potentially finishing a few games.</p> <p>""Cure Burn"" is nowhere near powerful enough to keep up with many decks in the modern meta. However, it is a fun little strategy for casual if you are searching for a deck that does not use an archetype to run.

""Vendread"" is quite an interesting archetype since it features a Ritual monster theme with Zombie-Type monster, which is still a combination that no other archetype went for. If you heard of ""Vendread"" before, you might be aware of the fact that the hype around them died rather quickly when the powerful support was missing, leaving them in the limbo of semi-playability. Nonetheless, I think they are functional enough to build a deck around and they do have some aces to work with that might surprise the unaware opponent.</p> <p>Starting with the monster line-up, I chose to include every ""Vendread"" Main Deck Effect monster except for ""<a data-name=""Vendread Core"">Vendread Core</a>"", since I did not need more Link material. That means one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Revenants"">Vendread Revenants</a>"", which feature the worst revive effect but the absolutely insane Quick Effect banish when used as tribute for a ""Vendread"" Ritual monster. One copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Houndhorde"">Vendread Houndhorde</a>"" for the okayish revival and solid ""<a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>"" imitation effect for Rituals, one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Striges"">Vendread Striges</a>"", which features a very good revival effect but a subpar Ritual monster one, and one copy of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Anima"">Vendread Anima</a>"" for added plays with banished monsters. ""Vendread"" does need some help from generic Zombies though, so I also included three ""<a data-name=""Gozuki"">Gozuki</a>"" as ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" helpers, three ""<a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>"" for the same reason but they also work as Tuners for the deck, two ""<a data-name=""Shinobi Necro"">Shinobi Necro</a>"" as additional resources when banished for the Ritual Summon of a ""Vendread"" monster, one ""<a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a>"" as yet another Tuner and more material, one ""<a data-name=""Shiranui Solitaire"">Shiranui Solitaire</a>"" for potential ""<a data-name=""Uni-Zombie"">Uni-Zombie</a>"" setup, and three ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" for the obvious handtrap effect, but also as a Zombie Tuner option for ""Vendread"".</p> <p>The Ritual part of the deck is where it's at though, so I included both three ""<a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>"" and three ""<a data-name=""Pre-Preparation of Rites"">Pre-Preparation of Rites</a>"" as consistency tools, alongside three copies of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Origin"">Revendread Origin</a>"" and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a>"". To make the most out of ""<a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>"", you need to Ritual Summon first, then activate the card to make it a +1 in card economy terms. ""<a data-name=""Pre-Preparation of Rites"">Pre-Preparation of Rites</a>"" is always a +1, but comes with the caveat of only being able to search for the combination of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Revendread Origin"">Revendread Origin</a>"". Talking about ""<a data-name=""Revendread Slayer"">Revendread Slayer</a>"", he is in the deck at three copies but is also a pretty subpar Ritual monster on his own. However, by using the ""Vendread"" Main Deck Effect monsters as material you can give him some additional power and he is the easiest Ritual monster in the archetype to summon. ""<a data-name=""Vendread Battlelord"">Vendread Battlelord</a>"" is the Level 7 Ritual and an absolute powerhouse in my opinion that can catch the opponent off-guard if they are not aware of what he does. You can easily summon him as the first action during your turn by ditching one copy of him from the deck via ""<a data-name=""Revendread Evolution"">Revendread Evolution</a>"" and then activate his effect to disallow the opponent from using monster effects, which in turn locks the opponent out of using handtraps and therefore gives you the opportunity to build your board in piece. I also included one copy of ""<a data-name=""Revendread Executor"">Revendread Executor</a>"" for his protection effect, but he rarely saw play when I tested the deck. The rest of the Main Deck is made up by one ""<a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a>"" as graveyard setup and three copies of ""<a data-name=""Vendread Charge"">Vendread Charge</a>"" to get your ""Vendread"" non-Ritual monsters on the field easier and to save resources from removal by dodging the effect in form of gaining another monster.</p> <p>The Extra Deck has a lot of colorful options, since ""Vendread"" on its own really does not need that much of the space in there. Both ""<a data-name=""Shiranui Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>"" work as beatsticks, ""<a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>"" can equip Link monsters for negates and is fairly easy to make, ""<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon"">Red-Eyes Zombie Necro Dragon</a>"" is a situational option with battle focus, ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" serves as the usual field nuke, ""<a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a>"" can work as a negation tool as well as searching for Ritual cards, ""<a data-name=""Formula Synchron"">Formula Synchron</a>"" can be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>"" which itself provides more resources, ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" is the usual backrow removal option, ""<a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>"" can have merit in some situations, ""<a data-name=""Avendread Savior"">Avendread Savior</a>"" is the only archetypal Extra Deck monster and can recycle resources, provides graveyard setup and can even potentially run some opposing monster over, ""<a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>"" is the counter option against another graveyard-heavy deck and ""<a data-name=""Evilswarm Exciton Knight"">Evilswarm Exciton Knight</a>"" is more of an emergency tool if you cannot manage to make something more useful and want to potentially stop the opponent from going crazy with summons.</p> <p>""Vendread"" has some interesting interactions and is quite a deckbuilding challenge; however, they do have a small number of dedicated players that experiment with various options, like using ""<a data-name=""Spirit Sculptor"">Spirit Sculptor</a>"" in order to search for other helpful engine parts. The deck provides a number of effects that can surprise the opponent that did not read the cards, since ""Vendread"" Main Deck monsters tend to revive themselves, the ""Vendread"" Ritual monster provide searches upon their demise, ""<a data-name=""Vendread Battlelord"">Vendread Battlelord</a>"" disabling entire card types and the Ritual Spell ""<a data-name=""Revendread Origin"">Revendread Origin</a>"" serving as protection for some of the archetypal monsters while in the graveyard. Granted, you will find better (Zombie) decks if you look for them, but ""Vendread"" is not that bad and certainly unique enough to give them a spin; and if you are really interested, you might want to check out my archetype analysis on them, which you can find here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/08/07/archetype-analysis-vendread/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2021/08/07/archetype-analysis-vendread/</a></p>"

Armed with plush familiars in their image and the mysterious powers of the pendulum, these musicians take to the stage.  Recently, through a fan of theirs, they met with several performers and spellcasters who wanted to see if their talents can summon forth dragonic beings of the stars, the frozen depths and the very Vortex itself. Coolia, the leader and teacher of the troupe agreed to the collaboration, albeit with concern for the safety of her students. The ritual and concert was eventually interrupted when a data thief crashed it, the ensuing chaos caused a mysterious hero to arrive, seemingly from a world on the precipice of collapse... ""  Alright, with Dawn of Majesty set to arrive soon. I find it prudent to update the profile to v1 status now.  Per the original profile, the aim is to have a semi-control deck that can consistently end on <span><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a></span> and an enhanced <span><a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a></span>. As such there are two new tools that I think could help with that: <ol>  	<li>The first is <span><a data-name=""Pendulum Xyz"">Pendulum Xyz</a></span>. A card that allows me to use the scales as Overlay Units, material for Xyz monster, and also allows one to be treated as the level of the other for the summon. As I run the Supreme King Package, this means I have a way to get Gate Zero used as material without <span><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon</a></span>, but the catch is that you will need new scales as a result. <a data-name=""&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008000;&quot;&gt;Duelist Alliance&lt;/span&gt;""><span>Duelist Alliance</span></a> can also search this card and as such I opted to run a playset of that, and one of <span><a data-name=""Pendulum Halt"">Pendulum Halt</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""Pendulum Call"">Pendulum Call</a></span>.</li>  	<li>The second is the upcoming archetypal Link monster: <span><a data-name=""GranSolfachord Musecia"">GranSolfachord Musecia</a></span>. A link-2 monster that lets you add a Pendulum monster form the ED to the hand, replace that monster in the ED with another one (provided one is even and the other odd) and then search a Solfachord with a level that matches the scale of a Pendulum summoned monster.</li> </ol> The general strategy is still to try to get <span><a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a></span> and <span><a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a></span> out, but the likely difference is that I would likely use Musecia as the first Link monster and then summon Masquerena later. What plays will ripple form those changes, and will these maestras used these tools for a crescendo?"

With a twist?  All aboard the pain train. ,"This is a budget friendly version of the deck so no Infinite Imperms, Zeus, or Ice Dragon Prisons, Ash Blossoms, etc.  &nbsp;  Strategy is the same as most other earth machine decks except I feel like Machine Duplication is an excellent combo extender. Summoning 3 Harvesters or 2 Trenchers can leads to a lot of easy XYZ and Link plays to push through hand traps. Also, summoning trencher and harvester off of Urgent Schedule can lead into huge combo plays without even using a normal summon.  Reasoning is a really cool tech since the deck runs so many different monster levels and having them in GY can help too. Also, if you pitch overdrive, it can be used in GY as well.  Considered main decking x1 Cycle Reader since it's searchable but the deck is too tight on space.  Would love some feedback. Thanks."

The current meta ends on 2-4 negates and interruptions so with magical muskets all you need is a musket monster and cards on your opponent's side of the field to go off. Muskets strength is gaining an advantage from what your opponent gives you, so if they run a control deck you're going to be able to spam a bunch of Magical Musket monsters on the field, but if you're playing against a heavy combo deck you are going to be able to add all your Magical Musket hand traps to hand. My deck best matches up with heavy combo decks such as Xiangjian, Dinos, Heroes, Drytron, Cyber dragons, Infernobles and etc granted most of those decks run a good handful of hand traps so it'll ultimately come down to what you open with and how many handtraps your opponent opens up with turn 1. The approach I've given my deck is a going second because I main deck Dark Ruler No More, as well as Forbidden Droplets which is busted against the current meta and is amazing in Magical Muskets as Magical Musketeer Max, is your ace monster his effect says in short gain advantage by the number of cards you opponent controls on the field so you don't want to pop or remove your opponent's cards just negate the effects of their cards on their field.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Strengths: The strength of the deck is you can gain a fast advantage quickly depending on what your opponent is playing which can spiral into a huge advantage for you in the mid/late game. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Weaknesses: The biggest weaknesses the deck has are being able to see a musket monster in the starting turn and being able to successfully normal summon a musket monster to the field, which is why I run Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay and Pot of Prosperity to give the deck a little more draw power and consistency.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Side Deck: The list from my side was a major focus on the deck weakness explained above by mainly targetting kaiju's and anti-magic arrow as monsters on board and back row is the major problematic cards that Magical Musket monsters struggle with the on seeing you're normal summon. My handtraps in the side such as droll and ghost belle target the majority of the format on meta decks, so I decided to run them in the side vs main decking them as Dark Ruler No More and Forbidden Droplets are a 1 card instant combo for Magicial Muskets</span>"
