In the case of this Ninja support, it is more specialized in removing the monster when the opponent monster is the face-down defense position. So I tried to increase the number of points where the Subterror is strong and to bully the opponent more colorfully.  The way the deck works is simple. Flip the opponent's monster, remove it, and turn it into my monster.  The main point of view is to make the opponent never do anything.  Put another card in Tcg because maxx-c is a prohibited card.  In the case of a rear-end player, it is recommended to insert a rear-end card using a side deck.  If you have any questions, please leave a comment anytime."

Both of them solve this issue by allowing for better access to Flip Monsters, even if you don't immediately have any in rotation. However, the new support also has brought along a new problem. The Deck is now extremely reliant on <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> and without any in-archetype searchers, it can be hard to access their new plays.</span>  <span>We play 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> as it enables all of your interaction on your opponent's turn. If you don't know what it does, it Specials a Flip Monster from hand or GY during the End Phase and you can Flip a monster face-up or face-down during either player's turn. 1 <strong>Nether Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong>. This card is the first Flip Ritual Monster and its Flip Effect Summons a Flip Monster from Deck face-down and it can Flip any number of monsters you control face-up or face-down. We only play 1 because it is a soft-brick in the Deck that should only be searched off of <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>. You NEED Tarotrei to Flip this card up during your opponent's turn. It does almost nothing on its own. 3 <strong>Prediction Princess Bibliomuse</strong>. This can Summon itself face-down when it is Tributed and its Flip Effect adds a Prediction Princess Monster and a Ritual Spell from your Deck to your hand. It also has an on-field effect to prevent your Rituals from being targeted or destroyed. This was the best card to come out of the new support. It is good Ritual fodder as it can just Summon itself back and it can even search 2 cards to allow you to make another Ritual immediately and it even gives insane protection to your Rituals. The Deck is heavily reliant on this card being in your hand as Ritual fodder so we must play 3. 2 <strong>Pot of the Forbidden</strong> and 2 <strong>Deus X-Krawler</strong>. These are your Flip targets for <strong>Tarotrei</strong> and <strong>Tarotreith</strong> and they can also help with making Rank 9's when Summoned by <strong>World Legacy's Monstrosity</strong>. 3 <strong>Spirit of the Fall Wind</strong> and 3 <strong>Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands</strong>. This Deck does not have an in-archetype Normal Summon, so we can get away with playing these. <strong>Manju</strong> helps get missing Ritual cards and <strong>Spirit</strong> helps search <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> or a Flip Monster to get into rotation. 2 <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> and 2 <strong>Effect Veiler</strong> as potential disruption options and <strong>Crossout</strong> targets.</span>  <span>3 <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> and 3<strong> Nether Prediction Ritual</strong>. <strong>Prediction Ritual</strong> enables <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong> as it lists <strong>Tarotrei</strong> in its effect, but the biggest thing to keep in mind is that it can ONLY Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotrei</strong>. You cannot Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> with this card. You can only Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> with <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> which can Summon a Prediction Princess from hand or GY in face-down Defense which sets up <strong>Tarotreith</strong>'s Flip Effect. It can also banish itself during the Standby Phase in order to Summon a non-Ritual Prediction Princess from Deck face-down. The non-Ritual Prediction Princess monsters are either bad or too restrictive with the exception of <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>, so she is your only target. But this card pairs nicely with <strong>Tarotreith</strong>'s on field effect anyways. 2 <strong>World Legacy's Monstrosity</strong>. This card puts Flips into rotation and is a 1 card Rank 9, but you don't want to see it that frequently anymore, now that there are better ways to get Flips into rotation, so we only play 2. 1 <strong>Called by the Grave</strong>. 3<strong> Pot of Prosperity</strong>. 3 <strong>Pre-Preparation of Rites</strong>. 2 <strong>Crossoutout Designator</strong> and 2 <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>. The <strong>Impcantations</strong> do not work well with the new Support as you want to use <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> as Ritual fodder to access her effects rather than tributing off 2 Impcantations, so we aren't playing any. Because of this, we need a lot of generic search Spells, especially since there aren't any in-archetype ones, and to ensure they resolve, we are playing <strong>Called by</strong> and a <strong>Crossout</strong> package.</span>  <span>You will almost never go into the Extra Deck, but we are just playing some Rank 9's and some Xyz goodstuff. 1 <strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 3 <strong>Phantom Fortress Enterblathnir</strong>, 3 <strong>Nine-Lives Cat</strong>, 3 <strong>Infinitrack Earth Slicer</strong>, 2 <strong>Sacred Tree Beat, Hyperyton</strong>, 1<strong> Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon</strong>, 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Draco Future</strong>, and 1 <strong>Number F0: Utopic Future</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck we are playing 3 <strong>Lava Golem</strong> because this Deck does not really need its Normal Summon all the time and its good removal. 2 <strong>Nibiru</strong>, 1 <strong>Ghost Belle</strong>, and 1 <strong>Droll</strong> as more <strong>Crossout</strong> targets and handtrap options. 3 <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong>, 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, 1 <strong>Harpie's Feather Duster</strong>, and 1 <strong>Red Reboot</strong>. You really want your plays to go through and you need all the help you can get to break an established board.</span>  <span>At minimum, full combo is access to <strong>Prediction Princess Tarotrei</strong> + <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> in hand. You want to Ritual Summon<strong> Tarotrei</strong> using <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>. <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> will Summon herself from GY face-down. <strong>Tarotrei</strong>'s effect Flips <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> face-up. Now, you can use <strong>Bibliomuse</strong>'s Flip Effect to add <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> and <strong>Nether Prediction Princess Tarotreith</strong> from Deck to hand. If you have a Level 9 Flip Monster in hand, you can use that to Ritual Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> or you can just use <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> on field. <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> will Summon <strong>Tarotreith</strong> face-down. Now, if you Tributed <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> for <strong>Tarotreith</strong>, <strong>Tarotrei</strong> can Summon her back during the End Phase or <strong>Tarotrei</strong> can Summon the other Level 9 Flip you Tributed from hand. During your your opponent's Standby Phase, <strong>Nether Prediction Ritual</strong> can banish itself to Summon a <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> from Deck face-down if you want. Then, <strong>Tarotrei</strong> will Flip <strong>Tarotreith</strong> face-up and <strong>Tarotreith</strong> will Summon preferably<strong> Deus X-Krawler</strong> from Deck face-down. Then, <strong>Tarotreith</strong>'s other effect can flip the <strong>Deus X</strong> and whatever other Flip monsters you have facedown up. <strong>Deus X</strong> negates all activated monster effects on your opponent's field while <strong>Bibliomuse</strong> will search for more Ritual access for next turn.</span>"

Thunder Therions! the idea of this deck is very simple. create an end board that provides the strongest wall in the simplest way possible. the origional idea was to combine the thunder dragon archetype with the plant engine, which consists of 3 Lonefire Blossom, 3 Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio, and 2 Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra. this would provide an engine that would be able to search out Ready fusion in which you would be able to get easy access too thunder dragon titan as well as extend into a board of a 3-4 negate apollousa, as well as a quick effect pop on titan.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">but then I got to thinking, what if I included the therion engine into the deck as a way to build a much more solid board? I was already using the plant engine as a main part of the deck as its main playstarter, so it would make sense that using the therion cards would increase the power of my board state. it took me a while to figure out the ratios for this engine, but thanks to the video from Revscards predaplant list, I was able to find the perfect ratios to use in the deck. now, thanks to lonefire blossom. the deck can now extend even further into a board that consists of 4 monster negates(apollousa) + 1 quick effect pop(titan) + 1 omni negate(regulus). this is the best possible board to my knowledge that this deck can perform. I decided to run regulus, Borea, and Discolossium all at 1 because you generally do not want to draw them as you want to summon Borea off of lonefire blossom or search it with Rose belle of revelation.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">Overall, I am very proud of this list, not only do I feel like I accomplished something I never thought was possible, I started to genuinely smile after I finished building this deck. thunder dragons have always had a special place in my heart as it was the first deck I ever took to locals, and seeing that colossus had gotten banned really broke me. I've spent years trying to give the deck some legs to stand on, but I've never really succeeded at that until now. I really hope ya'll like this list, and I would appreciate it if you gave me some constructive criticism on how to improve on this deck.</p> <p class=""_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM"">P.S. the extra deck is extremely flexible as you only need about 5 slots in the extra deck to function, so the rest of the extra deck is for you to decide what to fill it with.</p>"

Deck isn't fully finished so feel free to play your own variant of it.  Optimal play is 3-card combo: Diviner of the Herald + Emergency Teleport + LM ritual (preferably lvl 3 or 6). Normal summon Diviner and send Arc Light to the GY and Search Benten. After that play E-Telly to SS Geek Boy who searches field spell. Field spell to LM Fire than search Doombroker (or Firestarter). Ritual summon using Benten from the hand and set a LM Intervention, also Benten searches Vanity's Ruler. After that ritual summon other Libromancer ritual monster using Diviner who ss Angel o1. Angel o1 gives you extra tribute summon which you use to put Vanity's on field using it and Geek Boy. Then you can link summon Linguriboh using Fire for extra protection from Imperm. And that's pretty much it.Deck is build around it so you have other tech cards like 3of Preparation of Rites. You can even play 2-card combo but then depends what other cards you have in hand.  Going second is best to disrupt opponent as much as you can and then go for LM Fireburst via LM Bonded.  P.S. I hope we will get LM lvl5 ritual"

While Charmers are considered a more casual archetype, this particular idea (born of a friend's deck building recommendation) seeks to be one of many experimental decks I wanted to do for the archetype on a long road to finding its eventual niche when coexisting with meta decks. It is not meant to be truly meta-defining, but more to pave the road to finding a definitive deck for the archetype to one day see rogue potential. It combines the surprisingly good synergy of two archetypes one would never think to use together in a deck, and is arguably one of the beefiest Charmer Decks in sheer card total.  &nbsp;  <strong>Why are Charmers the Main Focus Specifically for this Deck?</strong>  As a Yu-Gi-Oh! player who has tried to run Charmers since their debut in <em>The Lost Milennium</em>, I've become a bit of a main of the archetype. And as more support has come out for it over the years, I've commited to what many will deem a foolish endeavour. But I am a firm believer that any archetype can have a decent chance at being great with the right cards to balance out their glaring downsides. (As long as it wasn't intentionally designed to be awful, obviously)  &nbsp;  <strong>Why Use Virtual World in this Deck?</strong>  One of the biggest problems with Charmers (from mine and many other people's experience) is that Charmers on its own is quite noticeably, painfully slow. Virtual World as a secondary archetype engine not only drastically speeds up Charmers with Virtual World's swarming potential, it also provides Virtual World's annoying amounts of recursion to maximize the usefulness of Unpossessed, Shenshen's removal and self-revival effects, and access to a lot of powerful Extra Deck cards that can win Charmers a game against more viable decks every once in a while. From personal testing, Virtual World surprisingly gets along really well with Charmers due to their Main Deck monsters more commonly being in the Lv3-5 ranges.  &nbsp;  <strong>Key Cards and Tips for Using Them in the Deck</strong>  This deck has a variety of cards that do a variety of things, however these ones are deemed the most important for setup purposes: <ul>  	<li><em>The ""Channeler"" retrains of Aussa and Wynn. They not only get Virtual World monsters into the GY faster to recur them later (giving the entire deck a proper flow to its synergy), but you can also search for Lili, Lulu or Nyannyan if they have not shown up in your hand yet.</em></li>  	<li><em>Unpossessed. This is a given for Charmers to do their part in the strategy. The ""Channeler"" retrains also have the same battle protection benefits as the six base form Charmers. Due to Virtual World's swarming capabilities, it is very likely you will be able to swarm your front row with ""Charmer"" monsters very quickly off just a single copy</em></li>  	<li><em>Fairy Tail - Luna. The quintessential bounce effect card in the deck, Fairy Tail - Luna is one of the essential cards the Charmer archetype is known to rely on.</em></li>  	<li><em>Secret Village of the Spellcasters and Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters. Because of your newfound ability to constantly swarm Charmers with help from the Virtual World engine, Secret Village and Secret Sanctuary become extremely annoying cards for your opponent to deal with. The only real catch is to not get caught with your pants down in regards to your Spellcaster total.</em></li>  	<li><em>Stumbling. While this might seem like a bad idea at a glance, this keeps the base form Charmers alive for a very annoying combo with Unpossessed.</em></li>  	<li><em>Virtual World City - Kauwloon, Virtual World Gate - Qinglong, Virtual World Gate - Chuche, and Virtual World Gate - Xuanwu. These cards are pretty much essential for any deck involving Virtual World, as it is the main way the Virtual World Monsters in the deck list can swarm the board.</em></li>  	<li><em>Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen. Shenshen serves as an excellent way to get rid of problem cards from the game while it is on the board. It can also recur itself and set up other Virtual World swarming plays.</em></li>  	<li><em>Awakening of the Possessed and Dark Doriado. Both of these cards play nice with both your Virtual World and Charmer Cards. Both archetypes get stat boosts from these cards when used for backrow, and it grants card effect protection to both your Main Deck Charmers and their Link Monster retrains.</em></li>  	<li><em>Spirit Charmers, Stardust Charge Warrior, Magical Abductor, and Coral Dragon. These cards serve as even more ways to speed up the deck's pace. Spirit Charmers can exchange a brick draw card or Virtual World Monsters for either more setup or 1 backrow and 1 Charmer monster from your deck.</em></li>  	<li><em>Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, and Ultimaya Tzolkin. CWSD can deal with problem cards and gain their ATK until the end phase. And while you can bring it out without issue due to Virtual World and Charmers playing nice in their synergy, Ultimaya Tzolkin can alternatively cheat it out without the materials.</em></li>  	<li><em>Cloudcastle, Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, and Vermillion Dragon Mech. Your biggest possible Synchro plays from the Virtual World Engine. Especially in Master Duel, this will be necessary for the Very Fun Dragon.</em></li>  	<li><em>Abyss Dweller and True King of All Calamities. Depending on the legality of the cards where you use this deck, you want to use either Abyss Dweller or True King of All Calamities. The Very Fun Dragon is obviously the most ideal card of the two, albeit with the caviat that Charmers can only use its power in Master Duel at the moment. Abyss Dweller - while legal in the physical game - still has its uses, though, provided you're contempt with what the Virtual World Engine has set up for Charmers in advance due to its Necrovalley-like effect.</em></li>  	<li><em>Literally every card in the Side Deck. Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring requires little to no explanation given the current meta and pace of duels. Triple Nibiru is helpful against any and all much faster decks using the Virtual World archetype as an engine or primary archetype. (Just be wary of potentially bricking with it) Gameciel can get rid of extremely problematic monsters for the deck and is the universal Kaiju to easily beat over once a problem monster is gone. (Or if you're feeling <strong>really</strong> cheeky, have Eria steal it back after its special summon) Effect Veiler is a flat-out negate for the turn in the form of a handtrap. Called By the Grave can deal with any singular hand trap.</em></li>  	<li><em>Evenly Matched. There are a <strong>LOT</strong> of risks with this card depending on the opponent when playing it in Charmers in general, but thanks to the Virtual World engine a well-thought out Evenly Matched set or hand activation can completely devastate your opponent. (Though to be fair, the same can be said for Evenly Matched in any deck that uses it wisely)</em></li>  	<li><em>Powerful Staples. A well-timed Solemn Judgement can win you the duel, Harpie's Feather Duster is an incredibly powerful form of backrow removal, and Forbidden Droplet is a very powerful non-targetting negation to as much of your opponent's board as possible that cannot be responded to by card effects. While not in the Main Deck or Side Deck, you should at least consider owning copies for your collection in case situations come up where these cards can make a difference.</em></li> </ul> <strong>Cards to Keep Your Eyes Out For, Depending on Which Modern Format of Yu-Gi-Oh! You Play</strong>  There are a couple of key factors to deckbuilding that will likely need to be gone into. There are two above especially notable cards for the base strategy, however you will only be able to use one of them in Master Duel for the full effect of this deck's synergy; when in Master Duel (When Dharc's Link retrain releases), you want to swap out <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Abyss%20Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a> for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=True%20King%20of%20All%20Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>. When looking to the future of both the TCG and Master Duel, <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Aussa%20the%20Earth%20Channeler"">Aussa the Earth Channeler</a> will become essential as the final addition to the Main Deck deck at two copies to make an exact total of 60 cards. When <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dharc%20the%20Dark%20Charmer%2C%20Gloomy"">Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</a> comes to Master Duel, he is a must-forge for the MD version of this deck.  &nbsp;  <strong>The Deck</strong>  Monster: 2x Aussa the Earth Charmer 2x Dharc the Dark Charmer 2x Eria the Water Charmer 2x Hiita the Fire Charmer 2x Lyna the Light Charmer 2x Wynn the Wind Charmer 2x Aussa the Earth Channeler [When It Releases for TCG/MD] 2x Wynn the Wind Channeler 3x Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan 1x Virtual World Kirin - Lili 3x Virtual World Mai-Hime - Lulu 2x Virtual World Roshi - Laolao 2x Virtual World Xiezhi - Jiji 2x Fairy Tail - Luna 2x Dark Doriado 2x Magical Abductor  Spell: 3x Awakening of the Possessed 3x Spirit Charmers 3x Virtual World City - Kauwloon 2x Virtual World Gate - Qinglong 2x Secret Village of the Spellcasters 2x Secret Sanctuary of the Spellcasters 2x Stumbling  Trap: 3x Unpossessed 2x Virtual World Gate - Chuche 1x Virtual World Gate - Xuanwu 2x Evenly Matched 2x Infinite Impermanence  Extra: 1x Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable 1x Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy 1x Eria the Water Charmer, Gentle 1x Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze 1x Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustrous 1x Wynn the Wind Charmer, Verdant 1x Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen 1x Cloudcastle 1x Coral Dragon 1x Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon 1x Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys 1x Stardust Charge Warrior 1x Ultimaya Tzolkin 1x Vermillion Dragon Mech 1x Abyss Dweller  Side: 3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring 2x Effect Veiler 3x Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju 3x Nibiru, the Primal Being 1x Called by the Grave 3x Crossout Designator  Other Card(s) to Consider: <ul>  	<li>True King of All Calamities (Master Duel only as of right now)</li>  	<li>Forbidden Droplet</li>  	<li>Harpie's Feather Duster</li>  	<li>Solemn Judgement</li> </ul> &nbsp;  <strong>In Conclusion, How Powerful is the Deck? And Should I give it a try?</strong>  After personal experience with it, this deck will still struggle a lot in current Yugioh purely because it's a Charmer Deck. (One archetype of note the deck has trouble beating especially being Altergeists) However, access to an extremely powerful second swarming engine gives Charmers as an archetype a significantly more likely chance of doing their thing against successfully some of the genuine meta deck archetypes. It definitely teeter-totters the fine line between casual and rogue with the current selection of cards in this deck for both Charmers and Virtual World. The potential is here, but might be easily dismissed due to the main archetype of focus and its infamy when compared to Virtual World as Charmers' companion engine. It is not a bad Charmer strategy by any means, especially due to the unexpected synergy with Virtual World. It's well worth messing around with if you're looking for a much more hectic and aggressive control variant of Charmers, or a much more...<em><strong>daring</strong></em> use of the Virtual World archetype.

Bless Master Duel for Miscellaneousaurus being at 3 and Verte,"<p>Great going-first or second deck with some pretty saucy combos. General strategy and card descriptions might be added if people ask, more combos to come.</p><ul><li>This deck has some pretty crazy combo potential that only gets better as you become more familiar with the interactions&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u><a data-name=""Small World"">Small World</a></u></strong></p><ul><li>Its effect is kind of complicated, you reveal a card in your hand, pick a 2nd card from the deck that <strong>only shares 1</strong> characteristic (ATK, DEF, Lv, Type, Attribute), and add a 3rd card to your hand that <strong>only shares 1</strong> characteristic (ATK, DEF, Lv, Type, Attribute) with the 2nd card.<ul><li>In this deck it works fairly simply because all the monsters you want to search are Dinosaur type. So if you have a Dino in hand you can select a Dino in deck to get to your 3rd card<ul><li>If you select Animadorned Archosaur or Ultimate Conductor Tyranno as your 2nd card, you can search any other Dino in your deck</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><u>Some Small World Routes (3rd card is what is added to your hand)</u><ul><li>Any Earth Dinosaur in hand &gt; Animadorned Archosaur or Ultimate Conductor Tyranno &gt; Whichever Earth Dinosaur you need (usually Souleating Oviraptor)</li><li>Animadorned Archosaur in hand &gt; Ash Blossom &gt; Miscellaneousaurus</li><li>Either PSY-Framegear in hand &gt; Ultimate Conductor Tyranno &gt; Whichever Earth Dinosaur you need (usually Souleating Oviraptor)</li><li>Token Collector in hand &gt; Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon &gt; Animadorned Archosaur or Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>General Strategy/Tips</strong></p><ul><li>If going first, your goal is to get as many interactions (negates, destroys, interruptions, special summons) as possible set up. This can sometimes mean leaving an extra Baby/Petite on the field or in hand while you have Lost World and UCT or DPE so you can summon an extra token if the first is destroyed to keep protection.</li><li>If going second, focus on trying to get 2 UCTs out on the same turn, even if that means sacrificing Verte or DPE as bait so you can get Double Evolution Pill or UCT to resolve.<ul><li>Just 2 UCTs can put out between 4500-9500 damage (depending on how many monsters they have) on an all defense-position board, or even more if some monsters are in attack-position. Plus it is very easy to get out additional low-level monsters to get enough damage for game.</li></ul></li><li>A big part of this deck when going first is learning when and which negate/interrupt to use for your opponent's effect. As a general rule, try to really maximize the impact of Evolzar Dolkka's negate-and-destroy effect as IMO it can have the most significant impact (don't forget it isn't limited to once per turn and plan accordingly).&nbsp;<ul><li>I usually use Verte as fuel for the first activation of DPE or UTC in a turn, and DPE as fuel for the second (unless you have a Baby/Petite or Token Collector in hand, in which case use that for UCT and Verte for DPE)</li></ul></li><li>DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ULTIMATE CONDUCTOR TYRANNO! Even if things are looking rough and your opponent has cleared most/all of your board, you have a second UCT in your deck that is extremely easy to summon on Turn 3. If you draw/have a Miscellaneousaurus, Animadorned Archosaur, Double Evolution Pill, or UCT, you can summon it. From there it can often clear your opponent's often sub-optimal field (from fighting through your 1st turn board) with its ability to attack and destroy or send to GY each monster once.<ul><li>Big beatsticks are not given enough respect in this format, as long as you can summon and protect them (Misc does a great job of this and is at 3 in Master Duel) they can still effectively clear an opponent's board.</li></ul></li><li>When comboing, keep track of how many ""destroys"" you have remaining (Souleating, Scrap Raptor, Archosaur, etc) as that determines how much combo you have left, and you usually want to make it so Giant Rex is the last card you summon off of Baby/Petite (unless its in hand).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Important Cards</strong></p><p><strong><a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is perhaps the most important card in the deck alongside Souleating. If its effect resolves you basically have free reign until you start Link summoning, as your Dinos are immune to all your opponent's activated effects (yes this means Nibiru, Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermanence, etc) even though they can still be activated. PLUS, its ability to banish from GY to special summon from deck is necessary for the base combo and can come in clutch turn 3 by getting you another Souleating and Giant Rex (just banish the Rex along with 2 others and Misc) which means free Dolkka or Abyss Dweller. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other main combo card in this deck. On summon effect is vital for getting Misc or Baby to your hand. Activated effect can be used to destroy a Babycerasaurus on the field to special summon another Babycerasaurus from your GY, or to activate Lost World by targeting a Juraegg Token. Also great Xyz and Synchro material.&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Giant Rex</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your classic combo extender, just make sure it gets to the GY so you can banish it with Double Evolution Pill, Ultimate Conductor Tyranno, or Miscellaneousaurus. Usually special summoned off of your last Babycerasaurus, then used for Link/Synchro summoning, then banished and special summoned back to the field, then used for Xyz summoning (usually the first material detached as well). Don't forget it <strong>can't</strong> attack directly when calculating if you have game or not. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Token Collector"">Token Collector</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bring Sword Soul meta-slaves down a peg with this underrated handtrap (I've had a fair share instantly dip when I activate its effect). It also combos perfectly with Lost World, giving you a free activation of Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon each turn a dino is summoned (even on your opponent's turn). It is also Lv.4 meaning you can use it to make Abyss Dweller or Tornado Dragon. It also works well with Ultimate Conductor Tyranno as you can destroy it for cost without worry as its effect activates from the GY as well as the hand. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;This card works well with cards such as Fossil Dig, Double Evolution Pill, Fusion Destiny, and Miscellaneousaurus's GY effect to protect them against Ash Blossom, or against a pre-emptive Maxx ""C"". If you manage to use it during your turn and have the go-to combo, it means you get an extra Xyz summon (just use the 2 PSY monsters to make Borreload Savage Dragon instead of your 2 Lv.4 dinos) for another Dolkka or an Abyss Dweller or Laggia. Otherwise, it makes great fodder for Ultimate Conductor Tyranno's effect. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno (UCT)"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno (UCT)</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boss monster of your Main Deck, for a reason. Can attack all of your opponent's monsters once each, and can non-targeting send to GY any Defense-Position monsters (this can be very useful). Not to mention it gives you an interrupt by flipping all of your opponent's monsters face-down (this kills Synchro and Xyz, a screw you to Sword Soul and Virtual World).&nbsp; Never underestimate how bad a full field of facedown cards can be for your opponent if they are not running Link cards. &nbsp;The cost of it's ability also provides many opportunities. If you have Petiteranodon in your hand you can use it for cost and special summon Dinowrestler Pankratops, giving you an extra destroy. If you have either Baby or Petit in hand or on field plus a Lost World on the field, you can also summon a token to the opponent's field during their turn and gain the benefits of Lost World (and possibly Token Collector). &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Dinowrestler Pankratops"">Dinowrestler Pankratops</a></strong> Free special summon when going second, quick effect tributes itself for cost to destroy 1 card on your opponent's field (from GY so avoids Skill Drain), and can be special summoned during your opponent's turn by destroying a Petiteranodon in hand or on field with UCT's effect. Pretty good ""mini-boss."" &nbsp; <a data-name=""&lt;span style=""><strong>Evolzar Dolkka&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For such a good card it's surprisingly easy to summon, making it your go to negate card. Gives you 2 monster effect negate-and-destroys that can be used on the same turn. General tip is to try to maximize the impact of its ability to destroy cards by using other negates or handtraps when applicable (e.g. use Called By on your opponent's Ash or Effect Veiler rather than Dolkka b/c its destruction ability would be wasted on them). &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This card can singlehandedly shut down or cripple a large number of decks (Eldlich, Phantom Knights, Tenyi-Sword Soul, etc) but can also be completely useless against many others. Therefore, I don't usually recommend it when going first unless you can somehow get an extra Xyz summon after Dolkka. Going second or on Turn 3 it works great because you know if it will affect your opponent's deck or not.&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Usually only brought out via the Scrap engine, giving it 2 Borrel Counters. Try to save it's negate for Spell/Trap effects as Dolkka only negates monster effects. People are unreasonably afraid of this monster and will often waste their kaiju or Effect Veiler on it rather than Dolkka, DPE, or UCT, which is good for you. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone in Master Duel knows what this card does by this point. HOWEVER, it works especially well in this deck because of its ability to destroy cards on your field as well. DPE works so well with lost world and Baby/Petit, being able to trigger Lost World by targeting the Token to destroy Petit in deck giving you Pankertops, or by destroying Baby/Petit, summoning a dino, and triggering Lost World's effect to summon a Token (giving you the benefits of Lost World). Plus it is very easy to summon via Verte Anaconda in this deck. &nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You don't need this card in hand for this deck to be powerful, but it adds so much combo versatility and protection when you do. Always make sure to activate Lost World before normal summoning a dino so you get the token. Soulwating Oviraptor, Token Collector, Scrap Wyvern, DPE, and Dinowrestler Pankertops can all activate Lost World's second effect by targeting the Token on your opponent's field, giving you a free dino (by destroying Baby or Petit in deck). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When there is a token on the field and Lost World is active, your opponent cannot target any monster on the field other than Tokens with effects. This can be a great layer of extra protection for your board, and can also hurt your opponent (e.g. Virtual World won't be able to target their monsters to special summon, only their spells and traps) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Main Combo Routes Based on Cards in Hand</strong></p><ul><li>Note for nitpickers: <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig replaces any Lv. 6 or lower Dino and </a><a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> is your 4th <a data-name=""Lost World"">Lost World</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp; <strong><a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> and <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> or <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus (Main Go-To Combo)</a></strong> (if possible) Activate <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a> &gt; Summon <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor,"">Souleating Oviraptor,</a> activate effect &gt; Search <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> (or Misc.

The idea behind it is that since you're running three different archetypes, your opponent will struggle to counter you since you can be incredibly persistent with an entirely different archetype.

I was originally going to have another search card apart form <em>Terraforming</em> but meh. <em>Curse Necrofear</em> is second boss card and is used for its special summon effect + shuffling the banished fiends back into your deck. All the other cards are basically bounce/damage reflect cards to stall for the <em>Necro's &amp; Sanctuary. Kuriboh, Fader, Needle Worm, Man-Eater Bug, Jowls of Dark Demise, Slate Warrior, Mad Archfiend, Pot of Duality, Scrap-Iron Scarecrow, Metal Reflect Slime, Spirit Barrier &amp; Magic Cylinder </em>are all used for reflect, stall and/or damage stall.  no links or anything bc i find that stuff boring. it's kinda like Bankura's anime deck but i made adjustments and got rid of spirit board bc that's lame. idk enjoy it lol"

An in archetype way was made possible with the release of <a data-name=""Tailwind of Gusto"">Tailwind of Gusto</a>. It adds another Gusto Spell/Trap from the deck to your hand by discarding 1 Wind type monster from your hand (Adding itself or Contact with Gusto as the other target). Another way is to discard it by the effects of other cards such as <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a>, <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> or even <a data-name=""Mariamne, the True Dracophoenix"">Mariamne, the True Dracophoenix</a> in a True Draco version.  After using the effect there are many ways of summoning Daigusto Sphreez such as through a <a data-name=""Gusto Vedir"">Gusto Vedir</a> or <a data-name=""Pilica Descendant of Gusto"">Pilica Descendant of Gusto</a> line. With <a data-name=""Daigusto Sphreez"">Daigusto Sphreez</a>'s effect you can add Gusto Griffin back from the GY and set up the same combo for the next turn with <a data-name=""Tailwind of Gusto"">Tailwind of Gusto</a>.  &nbsp;  <b>Pilica Descendant of Gusto and the Witches:</b>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//7/78/PilicaDescendantofGusto-PRIO-EN-SR-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  Both Pilica and Windwitches share the same ish flaw. They both Wind Lock you in different ways. However both halves of the deck want to Synchro spam so it is negligible in actual duel but limits your deck building a lot. Unless you need to go into <a data-name=""Number 3: Cicada King"">Number 3: Cicada King</a> which could be a problem if you are under <a data-name=""Windwitch - Ice Bell"">Windwitch - Ice Bell</a>'s effect.  You are also able to summon back <a data-name=""Windwitch - Glass Bell"">Windwitch - Glass Bell</a> after she hits the graveyard with Pilica's effect for a quick LV7 Synchro play or <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> if you have access to <a data-name=""Gusto Vedir"">Gusto Vedir</a> by his own extender effect or Tailwind of Gusto.  Pilica can also set you for the Griffin Loop after summoning a Gusto Vedir back with her effect then summoning Daigusto Sphreez.  Lastly depending on how you order your sends to the graveyard and how you made use of <a data-name=""Gusto Vedir"">Gusto Vedir</a> by either extension or normal summoning you can also special summon <a data-name=""Gusto Falco"">Gusto Falco</a> (That you sent with Vedir's <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> effect) with Pilica's effect while already having a Gusto Vedir on the field. After doing so you can either go for <a data-name=""Accel Synchro Stardust"">Accel Synchro Stardust</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Accel Synchro Stardust&quot;&gt;Accel Synchro Stardust&lt;/a&gt; Dragon""> Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> for more negates and a way to add a card back from the GY.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>I am not locked into Wind. WE ARE! </span></strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/e/e0/MapleMaiden-BACH-EN-C-1E.png/450px-MapleMaiden-BACH-EN-C-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  Having easy and quick access to LV7 Synchros enables us to make use of <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a>'s amazing effect declaring ""Wind"".  Coupled with <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> this combo is pretty much a <a data-name=""Number 4: Stealth Kragen"">Number 4: Stealth Kragen</a> floodgate. Coupled with <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> and a Negate can be pretty hard to out.  This part of the deck is easily swappable if you need more handtraps like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> or <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>. This combo becomes a lot worse if your opponent is also on a Wind strategy making it redundant.  &nbsp;  <span><strong>Sphreez OTK:</strong></span>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//d/dc/DaigustoSphreez-HA06-EN-ScR-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  The most classic and well known way of playing this deck. The main concept it is to make use of <a data-name=""Daigusto Sphreez"">Daigusto Sphreez</a>'s reversal damage effect with your smaller Gusto monsters such as <a data-name=""Gusto Egul"">Gusto Egul and </a><a data-name=""Gusto Gulldo"">Gusto Gulldo</a> who can float and attack their big monsters. This line is significantly easier to perform with cards like Tailwind and Griffin which can summon Egul from the deck. And even more so if you decide to make use of/side in <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> and <a data-name=""Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju"">Gadarla, the Mystery Dust Kaiju</a>.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Kryptonite:</span></strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//d/d9/PoisonousWinds-PHSW-EN-C-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  This deck is very weak against <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>. She can stop Vedir, Tailwind, Ice Bell, Griffin... heavens forbid you had to discard another card other than Griffin for a <a data-name=""Wynn the Wind Channeler"">Wynn the Wind Channeler</a> search. You suddenly have to play with 3-4 cards in your oponer due to a very obvious and great Ash target. She is the Kryptonite. Sadly she is the most prevelant hand trap in Yu-Gi-Oh. Better get used to baiting and going for plan B. Usually it comes down to your opponent having a second/third hand trap or not for your follow up play after ""<strong>baiting</strong>"" the Ash. Surprisingly enough this deck also suffers a little against <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> as opposed to regular negation hand traps since you want your monsters and <a data-name=""Tailwind of Gusto"">Tailwind of Gusto</a> to stay on the field.  &nbsp;  <strong>Notable Extra Deck Options:</strong>  <img class="""" src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/1/10/DaigustoLaplampilica-DAMA-EN-SR-1E.png/450px-DaigustoLaplampilica-DAMA-EN-SR-1E.png"" alt="""" width=""139"" height=""190"" />  There are a few extra deck monsters worth mentioning that I did not find space in this build. You would usually side out either <a data-name=""Daigusto Gulldos"">Daigusto Gulldos</a> or <a data-name=""Maple Maiden"">Maple Maiden</a> for these but feel free to do any alterations as you see fit.  <a data-name=""Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen"">Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen</a> can be a powerful option but can limit some of your lines depending on when you summon it.  <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a> is a good monster to have in a lot of match ups. Being able to banish keycards from your opponent's graveyard is a very powerful interaction.  <a data-name=""Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu"">Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu</a> more reliable as the game goes but a little hard to set up on your first turn.  <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> is another card that you won't be summoning turn one much like Jiujiu but can be hard summoned once the GY is loaded. Otherwise, a great card.  <a data-name=""Daigusto Laplampilica"">Daigusto Laplampilica</a> can be easily summoned sharing the same star line as <a data-name=""Daigusto Sphreez"">Daigusto Sphreez</a>. Her protection effect does come up more often than you would expect. Especially useful for Sphreez OTK when you NEED to keep her safe from targeted negation or just in general. She can also set up your GY with different Gustos names/mats for a Sphreez summon. Such as sending <a data-name=""Caam, Serenity of Gusto"">Caam, Serenity of Gusto</a> and <a data-name=""Gusto Falco"">Gusto Falco</a> to the GY. Just be wary of Nibiru, the Primal Being.  <a data-name=""Totem Bird"">Totem Bird</a> just an one use Spell/Trap negate.  <a data-name=""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara"">Hi-Speedroid Chanbara</a> for OTKs.  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>Decklist:</span></strong></span>"

I consider this deck to be as strong as Virtual World, so I specifically consider this Super Quant decklist a meta deck. You really don't know the deck's real potential.

Youtube link inside","Attention Synchro players! Auroradon ban and Halqifibrax limit got you down? Worry no more, since the next evolution of Synchro-pile-goodstuff finds itself in it’s next evolution – PUNK Adventure Therion!  Since the release of Dimension Force, powerups to the PUNK and Adventure archetypes allowed more powerful boards to be created and more answers to annoying floodgates like Artifact Scythe. The introduction of the “Therion” archetype also boosted decks such as ABC Dragon Buster or Sunavalon to meta relevance mostly because of its famous omni-negate, Therion Regulus. This deck uses the strengths of all three archetypes to create one cohesive, super strong strategy! <p></p> <p><span><strong>ARCHETYPES, ENGINES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></span></p>                 As the deck’s name implies, this deck has three main archetypes smushed together – PUNK, Adventurer and Therion. Staples cards form the rest of the cards in the deck: <ul>  	<li>The <strong>PUNK</strong> cards in the Main Deck consist of 11 cards:</li> </ul> <em>3 Emergency Teleport, 3 Ze Amin, 2 Ogre Dance, 2 Foxy Tune and 1 Deer Note</em>. In the Extra deck, there is <em>1 Amazing Dragon</em>. These cards form the basis of this deck’s main combo lines.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The <strong>Adventurer</strong>cards in the Main Deck consist of 11 cards:</li> </ul> <em>3 Aquamancer of the Sanctuary, 3 Rite of Aramesia, 1 Wandering Gryphon Rider, 1 Illegal Knight, 1 Fateful Adventure, 1 Dracoback and 1 Foolish Burial</em>. The Adventurer cards are used in this strategy to provide blanket protection and bait from interruption – allowing your PUNK combo to work successfully.  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The <strong>Therion</strong> cards in the main deck consist of 13 cards:</li> </ul> <em>3 Discolosseum, 1 Terraforming, 3 Endless Engine Argyro System, 2 “King” Regulus, 1 “Lily” Borea, 2 “Duke” Yul and 1 “Reaper” Fum. </em>The Therion cards are also used to insulate the PUNK combo from interruption, mostly through Regulus’ omni-negate. The Therion monsters can also be used as extra bodies for Synchro/XYZ plays.  &nbsp;  <em>There are other sets of cards in this deck that support their boss monster, or the strategy as a whole: </em>  &nbsp; <ul>  	<li>The <strong>Staple</strong> cards in the maindeck consists of 15 cards:</li> </ul> <em> </em>  <em>The handtraps are 3 Psyframe Gamma and 1 Driver. 3 Effect Veiler. </em>Not many handtraps are in this deck, since it can naturally play through opponent’s interruption quite easily. All handtraps are light, since they can be excavated by Chaos Ruler. Effect Veiler is also a target for Halqifibrax, which then can be used to create Accesscode through Selene for quick OTKs.  &nbsp;  <em>The spell staples are 3 Triple Tactics Talent, 1 Called by the Grave and 1 Forbidden Droplet. Triple Tactics Talent</em> is excellent this format because of the abundance of handtraps and on-field monster threats that always render this card live. <em>Forbidden Droplet</em> is also amazing in this deck, since many of the cards don’t mind being sent to the GY (I only have 1 in my list since I can’t afford anymore, feel free to add more Droplets).  &nbsp;  <em>The two Halqifibrax target tuners in this deck are Plaguespeader Zombie and Jet Synchron. </em>These tuners can make certain boss monsters like Baronne De Fleur and Swordsoul Chengying, given the right set-up. These cards can also make Accesscode Talker, since they can summon themselves from the GY at the cost of 1 card in hand.  &nbsp;  The last staple is <em>Fairy Tail – Snow</em>, which is a target to be sent to the GY with Shooting Riser Dragon. This makes Riser Dragon level 3, enabling Level 10 or 11 Synchro plays available during your opponent’s turn.  &nbsp;  This deck is 50 cards so that there is the least possible chance to draw into this deck’s 7 hard/soft bricks: Wandering Gryphon Rider, Illegal Knight, Psy-Frame Driver, Fairy Tail – Snow, Jet Synchron, Plaguespreader Zombie and PUNK Deer Note. Keep in mind that many of these bricks don’t’ mind being discarded to the GY as part of your combo, so they can still be somewhat used if you hard draw them. While drawing most bricks wouldn’t be catastrophic, it is less than ideal – hence the 50 card deck.  &nbsp;  I intentionally didn’t include Artifact Dagda/Scythe combo in here, since I anticipate it will be on the future banlist. I also want my opponent to be able to duel since the fun in Yugioh for me is back-and-forth play, hence no scythe lock. (That’s just my personal taste, feel free to play Scythe in your strategy!)  &nbsp;  A card to add for consideration in PUNK Adventurer Therion is <em>Small World</em>, since it easily searches combo pieces, but that would require more research and experimentation. Another engine to add can be Illusion of Chaos + Magician Souls for extra draw power and another free body on board. Finally, other duelists add the Rose Dragon Package for more extension and plays. <p><span><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span></p>                 The gameplan with this deck is to pull off the PUNK combo successfully, insulated by the Therion and Adventurer cards. From there, boss monsters such as Baronne, Psychic End Punisher and Accesscode are turbo’d out to control the game or close out the duel.  Ideally, this deck likes to go first so it can make a board, interrupt the opponent, then OTK the turn afterwards. Going second this deck can shrug off interruption, clear the board and deal lethal by generating multiple high ATK monsters.  <strong>GOING FIRST</strong>, Punk Adventurer Therion amasses as many negates (Baronne, Gryphon Rider, Regulus) as possible while protecting it’s “towers” monster, Psychic End Punisher. While not always available, Halqifibrax is set-up as well, providing follow-up and interruption through quick synchro.  <strong>T</strong>he Punk Adventurer Therion Pilot’s board is hand-dependent and flexible. Sometimes you only have access to some engines, and other times your opening hand has everything. Certain boss monsters may be available because of extra bodies you have on board. For ex. If you lots of level 8s, you can make Baronne with Halq -&gt; Plaguespreader Zombie or keep extending by overlaying two level 8s to make The Zombie Vampire. This means that this deck is not a linear one-trick-pony, and you can choose how you want to optimally play!  Everybody already knows the Adventurer and Halq/Accesscode combo, so I’ll only be explaining the PUNK combos. (Shoutout to Tune World from YouTube for these combos!)  <strong>P.U.N.K Ze Amin + Discard -&gt; Amazing Dragon + Psychic End Punisher or Halqifibrax (For Quick Synchro):</strong> <ol>  	<li>Activate Ze Amin’s search effect to get Foxy Tune from deck.</li>  	<li>Activate Foxy Tune from hand and discard a card to summon Deer Note from deck.</li>  	<li>Synchro away Ze Amin + Deer Note -&gt; Chaos Ruler. Chain Link 1 Chaos Ruler to excavate 5 and Chain Link 2 Deer Note to resurrect Ze Amin (If you want to make a rank 8 with Chaos Ruler, resurrect Foxy Tune instead).</li>  	<li>Synchro away Ze Amin + Chaos Ruler to make Amazing Dragon.</li>  	<li>Banish 1 Dark and 1 Light to summon Chaos Ruler from GY. Use Amazing Dragon’s effect to summon Ze Amin from GY.</li>  	<li>With Ze Amin + Chaos Ruler, you can either make a Halqifibrax for next turn’s quick synchro or make a Psychic End Punisher.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  If there are extra bodies left on board after the combo (like spent Therions who already used their effect), I tend to make a Halqifibrax to summon a tuner from deck to make a particular boss monster that fits the situation. Most times, I summon Plagespreader Zombie to synchro it with a level 8, making Baronne de Fleur. Alternatively, Halqifibrax can tag out next turn -&gt; Shooting Riser Dragon, which dumps from deck Fairy Tail Snow making it level 3. The level 3 Shooting Riser Dragon can quick synchro into Psychic End Punisher with the level 8 on board.  &nbsp;  Another option with this combo is using the 2 level 8s on board (Foxy Tune + Chaos Ruler) to create The Zombie Vampire. Many of this deck’s resources and follow-up exist in the GY, and another mill of 5 cards is invaluable to this strategy. This card can also resurrect a monster sent to the GY through its effect, so it also can access Halqifibrax if you resurrect a tuner. You may even get lucky and resurrect a Regulus, putting an omni-negate on the field. Usage of The Zombie Vampire’s effect may backfire though, since your opponent may like having their deck milled to the GY.  <u> </u>  <strong>GOING SECOND</strong>, PUNK Adventurer Therion can usually shrug off disruptions, as long it’s not 5+ omni-negates. Cards like Triple Tactic Talents and Psy-Frame Gamma also break boards and generate advantage, once you bait a monster interruption, swinging the game in your favour. Once your opponent is cracked wide open, then you can play as intended with your PUNK combo.  &nbsp;  If you are held down by floodgates, this deck has a built-in floodgate buster in the form of Dracoback. Bounce their card away, and keep on dueling!  &nbsp;  This deck can even play through scythe lock, since Adventurer and Therion both don’t need the Extra Deck to function. PUNK can also summon beefy monsters like Foxy Tune, Ogre Dance and Deer Note without even needing the Extra Deck!  &nbsp;  If you feel confident you can OTK, this deck can play through interruptions, generate 8000+ ATK and easily clear the board through it’s many removal options like Gryphon Rider/Illegal Knight’s bounce, Psychic End’s banish, and Accesscode’s multiple pops so you can swing for game!  &nbsp; <p><span><strong>GENERAL TIPS</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li>Before you start off with your opening plays, try to bait out your opponent’s handtraps/interruption by using the Adventurer and Therion cards first. Once your opponent bites down, Triple Tactics Talent and Psy-Frame Gamma punish them!</li>  	<li>The cards in this deck discard A LOT (Fateful Adventure, “Lily” Borea, Foxy Tune). Be sure to discard cards that like being in the GY!</li>  	<li>A Baronne with a spent negate can tag back into Gryphon Rider during Standby Phase for another omni-negate, given that the Adventurer Token is still on the field. Also, if you want to play offensively, she can tag back into a tuner you can make Halq -&gt; Accesscode!</li>  	<li>Psychic End Punisher is an extremely potent card that may singlehandedly win a match vs. an unprepared opponent. If this card is your win condition, turbo it out and watch your opponent fall to an UNAFFECTED monster that continually increases it’s attack!</li>  	<li>This deck loses hard to common floodgates like Gozen Match, Skill Drain and Mystic Mine. This deck’s native answer to these floodgates is Dracoback. If facing a floodgate-based opponent, be sure to side in backrow removal.</li>  	<li>While shrugging off most handtraps, this deck is crippled when faced with Droll &amp; Lockbird and Dimension Shifter. D.D Crow hurts as well, since certain cards are needed in the GY for this deck’s engine to function.</li>  	<li>If playing a long grind game, the Therion cards offer the best recursion, especially if Discolosseum is on the field. Repeating high ATK monsters + an omni-negate every turn is usually enough to pummel an opponent to submission.</li> </ul> <p><span><strong>CONCLUDING COMMENTARY</strong></span></p>                 Behold, the ultimate deck that Grand Creators has to offer – PUNK Adventure Therion! Able to play through negates, floodgates and consequently OTK has led PUNK and it’s many variants to meta relevancy! Since the ban of Auroradon, Synchro pile decks have received a big blow to their power, but with the release of Dimension Force PUNK has taken the mantle of being the premier synchro strategy!  This is my personal version of the deck, and I’m super happy with how it turned out since its very fun to play and it’s competent enough to compete with stronger decks like Flundereeze, Swordsoul and Branded Despia. Me, an incompetent Yugi-Boomer, finally took a winning undefeated score in Locals with this deck. WOOHOOO!  I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online and IRL. And with that, I’m taking this deck to Locals this week, wish me luck! That’ll be all for now, GLHF Duelists!"

","So, for starters, this is my first deck. Don't expect it to be great. Secondly, the decks main focus is to link summon ""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame"" using all three Nephthys ritual cards. The combo will look a little something like this  1. Use ""Pre-preparation Of Rites"" to search for ""Conductor of Nephthys"", or if you already have it in your hand to search out ""Devotee of Nephthys""  2. Ritual summon ""Conductor of Nephthys""  3. Use ""Conductor of Nephthys"" effect to special summon ""Cerulean Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys""  4. Use ""Drytron Alpha Thuban"" effect to get ""Devotee of Nephthys"" into your hand  5. Ritual summon ""Devotee of Nephthys""  6. Link summon ""Nephthys, the Sacred Flame""  This is the ideal scenario you want however it can go a bit wrong, that is why ""Diviner of the Herald"" and ""Cyber Angel Benten"" are in the deck. In case you don't know how to use ""Diviner of the Herald"", you will Normal Summon it, then use it's effect to send ""Herald of the Arc Light"" from your Extra Deck to your graveyard, then use it's effect in your graveyard to add the missing component you need into your hand. ""Cyber Angel Benten"" simply allows you to add ""Diviner of the Herald"" to your hand if it's used for a Ritual Summon.  &nbsp;"

You get a good graveyard and set up the traps you want and pass, a combination of gravekeeper’s trap, flower buds, lost sanctuary, and the divine punishment lost sanctuary provides will hopefully let you hold out until you can etch out a win.  That’s about it! It’s incredibly consistent considering the sheer amount of searchers there are but optimizing the endboard is a different case.  Also if you want an idea of how consistent this deck is here:  3 Copies of World Carbon provides any earth fairy in the game for your normal summon (which you really don’t need)  given a discard is available the three seedlings and haze can grab any earth fairy  3 Hills and blooms can search any vernalizer card  Keldo can search anything relating to exchange of the spirit  Mudora sets up gravekeepers trap which can also search any earth fairy"

Click to see how you start the combo.,"D/D/D may be considered to be one of the most difficult decks to play with in the history of the YuGiOh! card game. Before trying this deck out in a tournament or online ranking, please practice multiple times to get a better understanding of the mechanics. After enough plays, building strong boards will feel like muscle memory.  The bet cards to have in your opening hand is Savant Kepler, Savant Copernicus, Griffon, and Swirl Slime. Kepler will add Dark Contract with the Gate to add any of the monsters mentioned that aren't already in our hand. Use Swirl Slime to Fusion summon Flame King Genghis with Griffon as the second material. Use Slimes effect to summon Copernicus, allowing you to summon Griffon from the graveyard and send either Ghost, Lamia, or Orthros to the grave. When Griffon is summoned, add to your hand D/D/D Headhunt or Necro Slime/Vice Typhon. Then use Copernicus and Griffon to Link Summon Abyss King Gilgamesh. Use Gilgamesh to set the pendulum scales with Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok and either Divine Zero King Rage or Destiny King Zero Laplace. Due to this effect however, you can only summon D/D monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. Good thing that's all you got!  From there, there are a number of end board you and finish with depending on your recourses. The best end board you can end on from their is High Wave King Caesar (2 summon negates), Cursed King Siegfried (spell and trap negate), Deviser King Deus Machinex (2 XYZ imprort), and D/D/D Headhunt (Monster negate and Change of Heart).  D/D/D is a difficult deck to play and even harder to teach. I'll try to make a video of the deck to better show the combos in to foreseeable future. If you have any questions, leave a comment and follow me for more deck profiles."

It improves consistency quite a bit, and allows for easy acces to any Suship-Xyz that you need. You run 3 Unexpected Dai to get a free Shari and 3 Painful Decision to get easy acces to Aka-Shari. Aka-Shari is arguably more valuable in the hand, as it can special summon itself and then go into any of the Suship XYZ with a material from deck.  The Suship XYZ have no effects that require a discard, which opens up opportunities to use some of the XYZ-Cards. Sadly most of them are bad, except for 2 (and an honorable mention): <ul>  	<li>XYZ-Remora: Detach 2 materials from an XYZ and special summon it. If you have 2 Fish-Monsters in GY you can then Special summon them, but they can only be used for Fish-XYZ (or links). No HOPT. Only problem: The Suships aren't fish, for whatever reason. And not WATER. They are fire, <strong>for some reason...</strong> Still, a great extender to go into Dweller, Emeral or Tornado Dragon.</li>  	<li>XYZ-Gift: If you have 2 XYZ-Monsters you can detach 2 materials to draw 2 cards. <strong>No OPT.</strong> It can make mediocre hands good and good hands great, but at the same time it makes bad hands worse.</li>  	<li>Honorable Mention: XYZ Block: A counter trap that negates the activation of a monster effect and destroysit by detaching 1 Material. No OPT. If only it were for Spell/Traps, because you usually go into Nummer F0, which already negates monster effects. So it is farily obsolete.</li> </ul> What's also great about these cards is that they are all searchable with Generation Force, which is also not OPT.  I only run 2 Supper Spot and 2 Daily Special because they can brick up your hand a lot and they are searchable with Shirauo-Class Carrier.  Sadly there is not much room for Handtraps in this build, so I only run 3 Imperm because it is a great, versatile card.  The one Avarice is for extension/recovery because you can get quite a few materials in the GY"
