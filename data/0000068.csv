Won't be around for long but still - a good deck in it's own right, and definitely rewarding once you p","Okay, this deck is simple. Like most Extralink decks currently in yugioh, it revolves around summoning a heck-ton of monsters and linking away to ultimately stop your opponent from using their extra monster zone, which in master rule 4 is a very, <em>very</em> important. So without hesitation: i'll explain all you need to know about this deck, and how to reach its amazing endboard.  I guess the main focus of this deck is to, obviously, a) stop your opponent from using zones and b) pitching spyral mission cards. You do this mainly using the discard effects of cards you play such as Card Destruction or the dangers, but your main play is to Master Plan. With the new Dark Magician level 1 monster, spyrals have gotten in-direct support. Not only can you recycle two spells/traps from your hand - which ties in with the spyral traps - but also get a free body on field as well as ditch master plan to the grave. This is amazing, as with a plethora of spell cards this card becomes easily searchable - notably the card Where Arf Thou.  The second big monster you want to see - spyral quik-fix along with spyral drones. You can special summon these monsters using one for one and, again, search them off where arf thou as your normal summon - once your souls combo has resolved. The dark warrior/malicious engine is in there, mainly for added consistency, but the deck would do just fine without it. So what's the ideal end board?  The main endboard you'd hope to achieve is one that your opponent has quite little chance of breaking through. You obviously want to have double helix in your first extra monster zone as he is the main combo starter. Then you would want to resolve a 3-card Tri-Gate. You'd special summon him just below helix, &amp; the way you'd do this is by having a Knightmare Phoenix on his left, and Ib on his right. The reason I run Ib over a popular card like Proxy Dragon, is due to the fact that you can summon it without really trying - and it has the additional protection from battle and card effects. Then right next to it you run a Knightmare Cerberus, for obvious reasons - and a Linkuriboh right above it, for extra battle disruption.  Overall, I'd give this deck a solid 7.8/10. It fails to handtraps a lot, meaning you want to open Called as much as possible. Along with that: there's also the possibility of bricking, which happens rarely - but when it does, you're basically better off playing game 2 and 3. Still it's a fun deck to play and very rewarding once you pull it off - locking your opponent out from zones is, in my opinion, better than setting up a board of negates. I'll definitely be trying to do more master rule 4 decks before April brutally murders me, and I'll try to make a quirky lock out deck as well, so look out for that. Comment some deck ideas down below, I'd love to hear what you guys have to offer!"

Misc tutoring argosaurus means your best Dino starters now have a way of not only searching babies but also POPPING THEM</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> - I used to run 3 dinos babies worth popping in your hand (counting petit), but with there being more ways of popping the 2 babies I play 4 (Tested 5 to much)</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""petiteranodon"">petiteranodon</a> - Hi Pankratops, yes he is a baby to.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Jurrac Aeolo"">Jurrac Aeolo</a> - a fire lvl 1 tuner thats all, eff doesn't matter, maybe once it will</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""J"">J</a><a data-name=""ewel Beast Argosaurus"">ewel Beast Argosaurus</a> - New card searches pill (searching caligo claw for infinite negate loop path is brick city and cringe af), there is no need to add bricks to the deck when he searches an engine piece anyway. You only need 1, (two level one targets for misc is all you really need)</li> </ul> Other Monsters <ul>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Ash blossom"">Ash blossom</a> - Fire, hi Agni, Prob forever staple at atleast 2 in Dinos.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Ghost ogre Snow rabbit"">Ghost Belle</a> - What other earth handtrap is there, I would run maxx C, Nibiru works to tho.</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher"">True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher</a> - The deck has plenty of fires, I really love the going second non targeting removal this card offers, he isnt really much worse then litho, I would maybe keep atleast 2 even if litho goes to higher count.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""True King Lithosagym, the Disaster"">True King Lithosagym, the Disaster</a> - Earth true king is back?

Eh its built in a way to always have everything, if you look closely there are 2 removal cards (exciton, castel, Crpcp). There are many stun optioms including 2 R4sEvolzars and Dweller (which is key because he can detach), Draw 1 is just worth it, specially because Dinosaurs can function perfectly fine without an extra deck, trading it for a draw is worth it, very few decks can afford ruining their extra with extrava.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> - This card being any of the 2 fieldspells makes it better then each</li>  	<li>3x <a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a> -  yes</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Ultra Evolution"">Ultra Evolution</a> - 2 is correct because you can &gt; Evolution &gt; Quatlus &gt; Evolution &gt; UTC across 2 turns. the card doesn't have to hard condition. also with there being 2 searchers for this card you always wanna be able to search the one for next turn if you draw it (which is fine 2nd one can wait). Hard drawing it is also fine, I know many people dont know the ratios of Pill stuff, Run 2 Pills, 1 argo and 1 Quatlus and you ll have a perfect ratio.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Set rotation"">Set rotation</a> - This card being any of the 2 fieldspells makes it better then each, Also random mystic mine out.</li>  	<li>2x <a data-name=""Dragonic Diagram"">Dragonic Diagram</a> - In testing realised 3 could possibly brick, there are just more ways of popping babies.</li>  	<li>1x <a data-name=""Lost world"">Lost world</a> - this is not just a going second card since ovi / pankratops can pop the tokens turn 1.

Later we are using ""world chalice guardragon"" in GY then SS  ""saryuja skull dread"" we using draw effect and his SS effect to SS ""rescue ferret"". ""Rescue ferret"" effect then SS ""Gem-Knight Lazuli"",""synchro fusionist"", ""blackwing steam the cloak"". Then we SS ""garden rose maiden"" on ""synchro fusionist"" and ""blackwing steam the cloak"" and we using 3 effects, ""synchro fusionist"" add  ""brilliant fusion"". Nowe we use ""black garden"". Then ""linkuriboh"" on steam token. Then ""blackwing steam the cloak"" in GY effect we tribute ""linkuriboh"". On ""blackwing steam the cloak"" and ""garden rose maiden"" we SS ""Predaplant verte anaconda"" and we use ""blackwing steam the cloak"" effect in GY.

I run some pretty spicy techs that disrupt your opponent for pretty much no cost. This is by far one of my fav,"Okay, this is epic. For today's upload, I've managed to make a deck that I could quite gladly call fantastic. This is a deck that I am proud of in the fullest - using new, quirky techs to spice up the decklist and make it even more of an absolute game-ender. I've used the quite popular Zombie Lightsworns, and made them viable again in the new format. Surprisingly, this deck has gotten less popular and strong since the rise of master rule 4, but with the new 2020 revisions this deck has gotten amazingly good - being able to run cards like Jack A' Booran for some crazy disruptions. To start off - this deck is fire! I've managed to end on boards like: Borreload Savage, Hope Harbinger, Balerdroch, Jack A' Booran and Abyss Dweller. This deck mills like crazy, being able to bring out so many negates makes it unreal.  The main monster you want to see in your hand is Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn. This card allows you to mill freely and is also a level 4 tuner, meaning you can access borreload with ease. It's also searchable off of ROTA, so you basically run 4 copies of this card (ignoring the draw power). This deck can also deal a <em>whole </em>lot of damage going second - with the effect of Zombie World making all monsters in either players graveyard zombie type; cards like Shiranui Shogunsaga are a great way to dish out damage to your opponent. With his effect, you can target cards with over 3000 attack and deal just about lethal damage depending on your situation. Jack is also a card that profits off of this effect, as its a re-occurring shark cannon of sorts; allowing you to special summon a monster from <em>either </em>players graveyard.  An impeccable card to play is Super Polymerization. This card combined with your field spell makes <em>all </em>cards a good target for Nethersoul Dragon. This usually leads to scooping, with your opponent setting up big monsters just for them to go to the graveyard and give you a 3k beatstick. In general, there are very little outs aside from backrow removal when zombie world hits the field. I also run a modest Danger! engine, like most of my decks nowadays...It allows you to draw and get more names in the grave, which is good as a lot of cards I run have an ability to plus off that.  With its new release, Arknemesis Eschatos has managed to make an appearance. I run three copies of melody of awakening dragon, allowing me to search him and Levianeer - a card that instantly lets you pop 2 cards from your opponents side of the field.  Over all, this deck is a whopping 9.1/10. I'm pretty confident in saying this might be a very sleeped on deck after July. Once we get our imports from Japan, this deck will be a force. This is one of my best decks yet, in my opinion, and has immense potential. It's its own thing and I can respect that - being able to create unbreakable boards with fun and original cards. I hope you'll fall in love with it as much as me!"

There are in service to both Gren Maju Da Eiza and Topologic Zeroboros gaining massive numbers and being able to swing for game.  The deck also facilitates a consistence Rank8 engine. By not only using the Danger! monsters, you can utilize Gizmek Orochi and Stromberg's effect to special summon a Hexe Trude directly from your deck, allowing you access to Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star or the Galaxy Eyes package.  On top of that, you're able to access Gren Maju with much more consistency against it being milled to the banished zone by running an entire Red Resonator engine to easily Synchro summon into Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Horse Prince to summon Gren Maju directly from the deck. You can summon Red Resonator with either Glife the Phantom Bird to pop a spell or trap, or Chaosrider Gustaph to get two free banishes from the GY.  Lastly, Topologic Zeroboros can be brought out easily with all the resources you'd be able to summon. If you able to end with Gizmek Orochi in the GY at that point, you can use Gizmek's effect in the GY at the right time to banish everything on your opponent's side of the field, potentially removing your opponent valuable resources. And on your next standby phase, Zeroboros special summons itself from being banished, and gains 200ATK for each banished card for both you and your opponent's sides of the field.  Remember, if you deck out before you win, you probably deserve it!"

Combos for the deck are your standard time thief and striker combos but you can make use of Area zero and time thief redoer by targeting it with the effect of area zero to search, then banishing the reoder until the end phase similar to what can be done with Raye.  Your other combos mostly resolve around controlling the board with time thief and using the sky strikers for consistency and rank 4 material and if needed banishing your redoer or destroying one of your rank 4's to use the removal striker offers.  One newer addition is Sky striker ace Sieg, The decks new rank 2. The combo round this is simply to banish one card your opponent controls then if possible get a level 4 on the field then use Sieg's effect to destroy Area zero to special another striker from the main deck to continue xyz plays.  More simple interactions is the potential OTK with utopia double which if it fails due to drawing the one of double or nothing it can be used with area zero for a search. Using Daigusto Emerald to put back your strikers link monsters back into the extra deck which is especially helpful with cards like Kagari and time thief Perpetua or any other xyz or link in general (though these are your main targets).  The side deck has been improved with added disruption and negation such as ways to remove problem monsters in niburu and the kaijus along with some match up based choices such as abyss dweller for Orcust and evilswarm nightmare for combo decks. The rest of the side deck is mostly optional cards or alternatives for the main deck based on preference."

This will cause the opponent's monsters that are linked to ""Zero Day"" to lose 1000 ATK each if they are not ""Codebreaker"" monsters, and I can destroy up to 3 opponent's Spell / Traps with the effect of the ""Virus Berserker"".  This is a going-second focused Deck, but it can also do very well by going first. If your opponent doesn't use Links, you can only use Codebreaker as a way to fill the field, and to add cards  from the Deck to the hand via ""Codebreaker Day Zero"", while using your monsters to Summon the Orcusts.

If you've never played weather painters before, the basic gist of their gimmick is that they use their spells and traps to gain unique effects of which they banish themselves as cost for, then return the following standby phase.  This effect lets them work well with dodging removal effects from the opponent - as well as many good board wipe cards you may use yourself, such as <strong>Dark Hole</strong>, Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, and especially <strong>Torrential Tribute</strong>.  The deck primarily functions as a stun deck, with it's primary ""win condition"" being make <strong>Weather Painter Rainbow</strong> to <em>non once-per-turn negate anything </em>and basically prevent your opponent from doing anything.  The deck use of a variety of floodgates that work well within their strategy.  <strong>-Anti-Spell </strong><b>Fragrance</b> works well alongside <strong>Rain Canvas</strong> - since you can bounce back the set spell cards to your opponent's hand, preventing them from activating them.  <strong>-Rivalry of Warlords</strong> also fits well, since all the Painters are Fairies (be careful not activate it prematurely in this build since you do play wind witches/crystal wing tho).  <strong>-Skill Drain</strong> is a Weather Painter <em>staple</em> in all builds is by far the best trap in the deck. It works wonders with painters, since they banish themselves to activate their effects. In short, they still work under the effect of Skill Drain. And if you ever needed it gone for whatever reason, you can send it as cost with Thunder Painter and facilitate it's effect to place another Canvas straight from your deck face up. You play the 1 copy you can right now, but should it ever come off the limited list years from now, immediately bump that ratio up.  -<strong>Imperial Order </strong>is also a good floodgate that is important in freezing out spell heavy decks like Sky Strikers, but it can also turn off your Spell Canvases too so it's kind of a give and take.  Other tech cards that work well with this deck are  -<strong>Pot of Extravagance: </strong>Unfortunately still stupidly expensive, but if you can afford it you should play it. Viable budget backups that can still somewhat work are <strong>Shared Ride</strong> and <strong>Upstart Goblin</strong>. <em>Desires or Duality is not recommended</em>...  -<strong>Kaijus: </strong>Instant removal, but with an added benefit within this archetype. You can tribute over your opponent's monster, then use a Painter monster with <strong>Thunder Canavas</strong>'s effect to bounce that Kaiju back to your hand for repeated usage. Any Kaiju can work, tho I personally prefer Gadarla particularly in this build due to the wind witches restrictions that may come up on occasion.  -<strong>Valhalla Hall of the Fallen:</strong> Instant special summoning for all of your painters. Works incredibly well with Thunder or Aurora and can kick start plays alongside Snow.  -<strong>Drowning Mirror Force:</strong> Given how often Painters banish themselves, it's quite common to deliberately leave yourself open to a direct attack, which works well with Drowning. Good for baiting offensive OTK decks and clearing the board in general, and while I don't prefer main decking it due to being matchup reliant you should always leave some space for it in the side deck.  -<strong>Topologic Bomber Dragon: </strong>Other than Gumblar (cus that's never getting unbanned) all of the Topologic monsters make for excellent alternative boss monsters that the deck can make without too much hassle. <strong>Bomber</strong> <em>basically become a quick play Dark Hole when paired with a painter and Rainbow Canvas</em>. The same goes for <strong>Trisbaena</strong>, tho a bit less regularly since it'll remove your backrow too (which in most cases isn't optimal since the painters gain their effects from their backrow). So if you accidentally banish all of your Rainbows on accident with Extravagance, or your opponent has an established field that needs instant clearing: Bomber is a very good alternative boss monster that is very easy to obtain, play and summon.  -<strong>Leviair the Sea Dragon: </strong>Probably the only Xyz monster worth playing in the deck. Generic Rank 3 that can bring back your banished Painters that aren't able to come back due to getting Ash Blossomed during the standby phase. Can come in clutch if you really need an important Painter back like Aurora for the protection. Not summoned a whole lot, but like a band aid it's good to have around.  &nbsp;  Overall, this deck is pretty fun but also semi-competitive. It's able to go up against most casual decks, and even give the meta a run for their money if you play it right. Good luck, and have fun with em."

This is a very easy to handle, and budget deck for some of those deciding they want to start strong and mighty while also getting into competitive yugioh. This deck is very easy to learn, and plays slightly like Zoodiacs - just not as overpowered and very heavy on the colour theme. So without wasting another second, here's my take on Super Quants - featuring the new support.  I've attempted to make this deck as coherent and consistent as possible: so I've mixed in two small engines to help out the deck so that it can run smoother, and decrease the chances of opening a bad hand. I run as little bricks as possible, with only 3 garnets in the main - and I've maxed out on all the Quantum monsters in order to get as many negates on board and as much synergy as I can get. The first engine I run - is a standard plant engine. I use <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> to get out my <a data-name=""Ophrys Scorpio"">Ophrys Scorpio</a> so that I can start the combo. The second engine of mine is a very compact Danger! engine. I only run five cards, mainly for draw and level three bodies. This also goes hand-in-hand with practically all my Quantum monsters - as they have effects that go off when they're sent to the grave.  The new link monster also helps this deck out quite a few. <a data-name=""Neo Super Quantal Mech King Blaster Magna"">Neo Super Quantal Mech King Blaster Magna</a> allows you to draw a card whenever you special summon an extra deck monster to a zone he points to. This works really well with <a data-name=""Magnacarrier"">Magnacarrier</a>, your ace card of the deck, as you don't lose any cards off of it's discard requirement. Meaning you can set-up a board with three disruptions for no cost so long as you have your field spell on board. This meant that I had to add an <a data-name=""Emergency Teleport"">Emergency Teleport</a> in order to summon <a data-name=""Blue Layer"">Blue Layer</a> and get to search. <a data-name=""King Blaster Magna"">King Blaster Magna</a> also brings himself back from the grave once he's destroyed, however you won't have those arrows in place so it will mean you must discard to make optimal negates.  All of the different negates disrupt your opponent in some way. However - you could only do it on your turn unless you use a Super Quant of the right colour as material. <a data-name=""Grampulse"">Grampulse</a> allows you to pop a backrow card of your opponents. This is very good for decks like True Draco that focus on the Spell/Trap zones. <a data-name=""Mech Beast Aeroboros"">Mech Beast Aeroboros</a> is practically a <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> with legs; meaning it can disrupt a potential link play your opponent might make to stop their combo like Isolde, or just to negate an effect of some sort. <a data-name=""Magnaliger"">Magnaliger</a> allows you to pop an opponents <em>monster</em> which comes in handy if they're trying to make a play. This one is one of the more easier ones to summon as you usually have either <a data-name=""Red Layer"">Red Layer</a> or <a data-name=""White Layer"">White Layer</a> on field. Finally, and by far the best one, <a data-name=""Lusterrex"">Lusterrex</a>. This card allows you to simply negate a monsters effect. Its a in-archetype apollousa except for only 1 negate. Either way, all four of these xyz's monsters are really good and with this build, you can usually end on 3 without losing any card advantage.  To be frank, this deck is a nice 5.3/10. It's a pretty mild deck and doesn't require much skill to tackle - which is a blessing in disguise. The cards go for cheap, so its a big win for budget players. The archetype in my opinion is very underrated and deserves more support. Tune in tomorrow because I've got a very interesting decklist as part of my daily upload. Hope you have a great rest of the night, evening, day or morning!"

The 2 loses I got were in swiss, against Anju's amazing Mekk-Knight Dark-stuff deck. Honestly, that matchup was all skill. I just wasn't on par with Anju. The other loss was against Wuh Train in top 8. I had never faced blue-eyes before, so I had no idea what I was doing, but I think next time I might beat him (or at least it will be a closer match).

Essentially, whenever I post a deck, I like to tell you guys about the good bits - as thats the main reason why I post this sort of stuff. However, even I almost get myself muddled up in a sense that I almost make it sound like every deck is Tier 1 amazing: which a lot of the times isn't the case. So today I've decided to reverse the psychology behind my deck and tell you all the flaws <em>I </em>faced when making the deck, to show and encourage you to make your own build of this archetype tailored to how you like it.  First thing that came up when putting together this set of cards, is the ratios. My original build saw quite a lot of dangers, which ended up being slightly bricky for this deck - as I ran too little ways to open up my extra deck and get the combos going. Thats why I'd recommend keeping a strong balance between the Shaddoll monsters and the Danger! cards - allowing you to open optimally way more and truly combo off into your negations like <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> or <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a>. You want to always max out on the semi-limited Dangers! as, their effects are the better ones out of all of them - and keep the level 8's at a low. The reason I don't run extra negation with cards like <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> or some solid protection + a pop effect like <a data-name=""Dingirsu"">Dingirsu</a> - is because you only run the level 8's at a minimal - this is due to a) them being not that helpful towards the end board and being simply bodies and b) if you have two level 8 Danger! monsters on board - you should be beating down your opponent.  I'd say the Shaddoll fusion monster line-up is pretty stiff so theres not much room for change in that category. You want to always max out on <a data-name=""El Shaddol Construct"">El Shaddol Construct</a>. This is due it to be a very powerful 2800 body that instantly pops special summoned monsters and has a built in <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> thats obviously really good with Shaddolls. The new card, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a>, is very good during the grind game - thats why you only want one due to it being situational. And winda is a standard disruption of sorts with it locking your opponent out of special summoning.  Overall, this deck deserves a hard-earned 6.3/10. Definitely not my best deck yet but a strong and consistent one for sure. It's pretty good at stopping your opponent, with the added boost of the dangers helping you out in making some pretty strong boards. Depending on the match-up, this deck could be a <em>very </em>tough competitor - plus, it uses one of the most fan favourite archetypes currently in the game. Could see this getting a cute regional top or two - but I doubt it will ever impact the game in such a drastic way like other support thats come out in the past, but it still will leave mark; I don't doubt that."

This pairs nicely with the gadget engine, as using the effects of <a data-name=""Silver Gadget"">Silver Gadget</a> and <a data-name=""Gold Gadget"">Gold Gadget</a> respectively, you can special summon pieces of the fusion monster from your hand. The symphonic engine has simply been put there to get an extra level 5 on board -  thats why the ratios between <a data-name=""Guitaar"">Guitaar</a> and <a data-name=""Miccs"">Miccs</a> are 3/1. And of course the Danger! monsters are simply there to get a free body on board to go further into your link plays: making <a data-name=""I:P Masquarena"">I:P Masquarena</a> or <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a>. The little 'sub-engine' I'm also referring to, is the triple <a data-name=""Galaxy Soldier"">Galaxy Soldier</a> that I run. I'm using the term very loosely, so its not really an engine and  more rather just three cards that are searchable.  If you don't have a clue about the two new support cards - <a data-name=""Gizmek Yata"">Gizmek Yata</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Union Driver"">Union Driver</a> - what they do is allow you to both extend your ABC plays <em>and</em> your Infinity combo. What Yata allows you to do is tribute your normal summoned monster and bring this card out onto the field. Then you can immediately after perform another normal summon, however you cannot summon monsters that are not the monster you just summoned's original type until the end phase. This is very good as it allows you to get a 2050, level five body on the field and perform <em>another </em>normal summon, however, this card locks you out of your Danger! engine while also stopping you from playing your other crucial negates from the extra deck. <a data-name=""Union Driver"">Union Driver</a>'s ability however is also very, <em>very </em>broken! This card allows you to equip itself to a monster you control (preferably your <a data-name=""Assault Core"">Assault Core</a>, <a data-name=""Buster Drake"">Buster Drake</a> or <a data-name=""Crush Wyvern"">Crush Wyvern</a>) and then either a) unequip itself and special summon it to the field or b) banish itself from the field and equip a level 4 or lower monster from your deck thats a union type. This is obviously very good as it can make summoning ABC a lot easier, and since its level five you can also benefit off of its special summon ability.  In conclusion, this deck deserves a powerful and hard 8.7/10. It might not be as meta as it used to during the ancient times of Master Rule 3, but it still is a great competitor and quite frankly a big sleeper deck in the new format. I think it has very good odds on topping one or two regionals - especially if we get Union Driver imported into the TCG rather quickly. The only shame with this deck is its brick factor. You mainly want the field spell in order to properly combo off - but with the amount of monsters its not allows easy. I'd consider maybe running a <a data-name=""Set Rotation"">Set Rotation</a> in the side deck along with a target in order to access it easier. I also know quite a few people that run Planet Pathfinder. While going through this build originally, I ran a few copies but it just seemed too cloggy and more like a waste of a normal rather than a searcher. Still, this deck is a force to be reckoned with - and will punish your opponent if needed!  &nbsp;"

Truly ,"What an awesome deck. For those of you guys who aren't familiar with Mathmechs - a deck that 'recently' came out in the TCG in the set Mystic Fighters - it is simply another cyberse deck: however, <em>it </em>specializes in spamming the board with monsters and going into one of the most broken cyberse synchros in order to OTK your opponent. <a data-name=""Geomathmech Final Sigma"">Geomathmech Final Sigma</a> not only has the ability to double its attack during damage calculation - but with its one turn boost using the effect of <a data-name=""Mathmech Multiplication"">Mathmech Multiplication</a> - can easily deal damage exceeding that of 10,000 Lifepoints. Unlike my Crusadia build from a while back - which you should still check out as it specializes in some bonkers combos to annihilate your opponent <a data-name=""Equimax"">Equimax</a> - this deck can ruin your opponents career in just a few simple steps (all depending on your hand of course)  The easiest and most simple combo only really relies on you having two cards in hand. What you'd want to do to kick-start your combos is normal summon <a data-name=""Balancer Lord"">Balancer Lord</a>. This card is a great starter monster and easily searchable off of cards like Cynet Mining. What it allows you to do is for the cost of only 1000 LP, conduct another normal summon of a cyberse monster - so using his effect, you can bring out <a data-name=""Mathmech Nabla"">Mathmech Nabla</a>. It has a very nice effect that allows you to pop your other cyberse monster and bring out the card that enables it all; Mathmech Multiplication. This card can make your Nabla a level 8 -  and since its a tuner - 4 + 8 = 12. Thats some maths that even your 36 year old algebra teacher would be proud of. So now that you have made Final Sigma - you can use Multiplications effect from grave and boost his attack to 6000!!  Conditionally, you're opponent might have something that would negate your combo - <a data-name=""Apollousa"">Apollousa</a>, <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>. But fear not; because you run a set of cards that not many people respect in today's format - Kaiju's. If your having problems with a card your opponent controls - just use <a data-name=""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"">Interrupted Kaiju Slumber</a>. Or just straight up <a data-name=""Gameciel"">Gameciel</a> them if you have him in hand. Either way, it shouldn't be too hard to break boards with cards in your hand - so the OTK is still very viable.  Going first this deck obviously suffers slightly -  but thats part of the reason why I run <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax</a> in the extra deck. You can benefit easily benefit off of the Link engine; special summoning two mathmechs and going into <a data-name=""Link Disciple"">Link Disciple</a> and <a data-name=""Link Devotee"">Link Devotee</a> in order to draw 1 and get two tokens on field. After that you can use a token to make <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> and then <a data-name=""I:P &lt;a data-name=&quot;Masquarena&quot;&gt;Masquarena&lt;/a&gt;"">I:P </a><a data-name=""Masquarena"">Masquarena</a> using disciple and the kuriboh on field. Using kuriboh's second effect - you can bring it back from the grave using your other token and on your opponents turn make Avramax.  Overall, this deck deserves a good 5/10. It's not the best deck out there - and like all OTK decks falls flat to handtraps. Sadly, the most we can do protection wise is hope we draw called by the grave. Still, this deck can manage to survive going first and hopefully pull off the OTK next turn, so it does have the safety aspect Crusadia lacked in my opinion. Still this deck is a good breather from the past two decks - being simple and surprisingly semi-budgety. I'd recommend this deck to those interested in OTK's or just people getting into the competitive scene. Be sure to watch out for tomorrow's deck as its going to be a <strong>powerhouse.</strong> Definitely something to look forward to so stay tuned for that."

Facing True Dracos and worrying about their deadly traps? Just counter them with cosmic cyclone or just completely lock them down with Denko Sekka, scared of facing Thunder Dragons with a Colossus and Titan on field - just Kaiju the Colossus.  This deck has many resources and is amazing going 2nd.  You can make it work with going first too but it's better going second since you can make use of the Kaiju Slumber.  And the best part is: You can make it for under 30 bucks.  Enjoy."

I am a big fan of this strategy due to its extremely unique playstyle, and amazing card art. Without further ado, I would like to walk you through some of my card choices and what the strongest combo lines are.  To start I play a going first variant with a going second variant in the side deck. Basically, if you have to go second game one that's okay you should still be able to play, but going first is preferred as a lot of the extra deck choices are meant to sit on the field and prevent OTK's if you brick. This includes cards like white aura dolphin which can be made with psychic wheelder and blue layer. This card allows you to soak up a few attacks if you have a blue layer in the grave. You can switch it out for Goyo Guardian if you are going second. The other really big going first cards are the artifact cards. In the main deck I play one Scythe and one Morraltech. I also play one lancea in the side. I play three sanctums so that you can play desires and still have a chance to draw it, as well as the two trap trick so that you can draw into it even easier. The artifacts work decently in this deck because Grampulse can destroy spell and traps on your opponent's turn if it has blue layer as a material. That's pretty much it for the going first cards, you can take all of these out if you are going second for the cards that rely more on your opponent playing.  Now for how you want to use each of the Super Quant cards.  Red Layer- Opening this cards means that you probably won the game. You almost always want to summon him first unless your hand is extremely stacked. Both effects are once per turn but you have a lot of ways to get him in the grave (ie white layer, or any of the Dangers). You special summon any super quant from the grave when he is sent, which can include the mechs. This guy goes to grave a lot so make sure you shuffle multiple copies of him back with blue layer if you can.  Always play 3.  White Layer - The newest super quant monster allows you to really unbrick your hand if all you have drawn is one other super quant. You can normal the other one and special this one for free. If it's blue then you can make a grampulse for free. If it's green then you just special this and get its effect. Red is probably the worst one to pair with white just because the discard may not be live for red. Either way, White layer is very versatile and puts Alphan back in your hand when it goes to the grave. This can be used to help you turbo magna off the field spell, or it can help you rebuild a board on turn two. Play 3 as well.  Blue Layer - Blue layer is used for two things: searching the field spell, and shuffling back red. With that being said Blue layer is the easiest to get in a mech so Grampulse will almost always be on board. You play three cause you need the recursion, and there is no real way to search it.  Green Layer - Green is sort of lack luster. Unless you are playing a spellcaster variant with summoner monk he isn't very useful. You don't want to use his graveyard effect often due to the fact that you have to throw a super quant out of your hand. The one good way to do this is to send Green and White off of Alphan, and put Alphan in your hand then discard it again. This is a free plus one, but its not all that useful. In addition, Aeroboros is, in my opinion, the worst of the mechs. It is decent now in the link era, but with MR5 I see it being less useful. I only play 2 but you could play a third.  Alphan - This little bunny is so great for the strategy. The only time it's bad is when you open only it and White Layer, but that's part of why you're only playing two. On top of that White Layer lets you recur it from the grave for free so you don't even need to waste your blue on shuffling it back in. He is always in your hand so you don't need to play 3.  Thats pretty much it, this deck can easily and consistently make the boss and one other mech to help support it. You can spin monsters left and right with Magna and it is so fun to do. On top of that, it is non-targeting, non-destruction, and he is unaffected by card effects. Oh and did I mention that he can stop your opponent from adding cards to their hands if it has 6 materials.  This deck was decent before and now with master rule 5, it has a lot of potential to be rouge.  Hope you enjoy and please leave a comment below on what you think I could change."

While this deck is a bit old, it's still a menace ","If you thought wrapping your head around my RDA list from a fortnight back was hard - yet alone yesterday's True King Dinosaurs - today's list will fry your brain like an egg cracked onto an Australian street. I present to you - my Burning Abyss deck (ft.<a data-name=""Block Dragon""> Block Dragon</a> and friends). When I was originally brainstorming for what deck to do - I thought about running Burning Abyss on its own: in theory this deck could work out, however playing with a couple of test hands and comparing the results was rather shocking and disappointing. Shocking in the fact that this deck was clearly better - going X-2. And disappointing in the fact that I would then have to remake the deck.  Playing this deck is rather simple. It strays away from how regular BA play - summon 3 copies of <a data-name=""Dante, Traveller of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveller of the Burning Abyss</a> - going into <a data-name=""Beatrice"">Beatrice</a> and pass. This deck can utilize Block Dragon to its advantage: ending on boards such as <a data-name=""Abyss Dweller"">Abyss Dweller</a>, <a data-name=""Fossil Dyna"">Fossil Dyna</a>, <a data-name=""Block Dragon"">Block Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Saryuja"">Saryuja</a> and <a data-name=""Beatrice"">Beatrice</a>. The main and simple concept is to get enough monsters to use block dragon - and to keep on special summoning. A lot of the cards in this deck have re-occurring effects or ones that allow them to bring themselves forward while also somehow plussing. You can make easy negate using cards like <a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a> or <a data-name=""Gallis the Star Beast"">Gallis the Star Beast</a>. Again, like most combo heavy decks - this relies on how optimally you open. You could also easily end on a <a data-name=""Hydralander"">Hydralander</a> for extra disruptions during your opponents turn.  A good EARTH attribute monster that not many people take seriously is <a data-name=""Kumongous"">Kumongous</a>. Not many people suspect Kaijus, especially from a combo oriented deck. If you want to go for the OTK with<a data-name=""Borrelsword""> Borrelsword</a>, you can rid your opponent of their ace card without having to worry about negations. This could become an out to cards like <a data-name=""Dragun of Red-Eyes"">Dragun of Red-Eyes</a> which arguably will become problematic if its announced in the TCG.  Overall, this deck deserves a strong 6.5/10. It pushes through negates like crazy with a million ways to start your combos and even more ways to extend. While being a going 2nd deck, you can OTK your opponent with minimal effort. The only problem is it falls flat mid-combo. Starting it is not a problem - but finishing it definitely is. Luckily, this deck is pretty rogue so your opponent might not always <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> an important card - but when they do, it hurts like hell. So much so that chainblocking sometimes comes in clutch for you to end your opponent. Still one of the most fun decks I've yet to play, even if it's ever so slightly complicated.."

Ash and Lava Golem are good for bored control. Dracoverlord can be summoned using Advance and when he hits the board he has a great effect that's very useful. Out of being experimental I decided to run Caius instead of Zaborg but guys you can either out, both are good to run I feel. Still in the play testing phase with this deck on ratios and different tech ideas, but so far so good with this set up."

Vanquish your opponents board using your True Kings, and beat them do","Let me start it off simple: this deck is great. With every single card being good in the opening hand - and barely any way to brick, this deck will wipe your opponent clean of any hope. With the brand new card being announced - <a data-name=""Jewel Beast - Argosaurus"">Jewel Beast - Argosaurus</a> - Konami proves that pills are always the answer. This new dinky dino allows you to search your <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>, and <em>enlarge </em>your board with it. Never before has summoning two <a data-name=""Ultimate Conducter Tyranno"">Ultimate Conducter Tyranno</a>'s been easier -  this new support truly brings out the best in our Paleozoic Pals.  If I'm going to be honest - this deck doesn't really have a finite combo. What makes True King Dinos so unique is their lack of a combo based strategy. All you really want to do is continuously pitch your <a data-name=""Babycerasaurus"">Babycerasaurus</a> to the grave using of a plethora of cards - <a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>, <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>, <a data-name=""Dragonic Diagram"">Dragonic Diagram</a>. Then, you can use its effect to special summon <a data-name=""Argosaurus"">Argosaurus</a> from the deck. From there you just try to combo-off and use <a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a> to solve all your problems. You can also pitch two dinosaurs to bring out <a data-name=""Agnimazud"">Agnimazud</a> or <a data-name=""Bahrastos"">Bahrastos</a> - which both banish cards your opponent controls (Traps and Monsters respectively)  Overall, This deck gets a good 8/10. It can quite easily drop a <a data-name=""True King of All Calamities"">True King of All Calamities</a>, but other than that ts mainly an OTK based deck. Still, the new support is great; it's easily searchable, and definitely has a powerful effect. This is, in my opinion, one of the better builds out there."

Feel like the master of faster, and synchro-climb your way to making negates for","Happy New Year everyone. I know I've already said that in my last deck breakdown - <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> <a data-name=""Pacifis"">Pacifis</a> - but I'd like to wish you guys a great upcoming 2020 once more. Konami has spoiled the OCG immensely - meaning there is now countless new support cards for just about every deck imaginable (Check out my previous decks if you're interested). So I'm going to be single-handedly taking on each archetype thats gonna rise to power in April of this year. Today, I'll focus on RDA - <a data-name=""Red Dragon Archfiend"">Red Dragon Archfiend</a> (ft. Resonators)  Without wasting any time, I'll get into your main combos. The key card in this deck is hands-down <a data-name=""Red Rising Dragon"">Red Rising Dragon</a>. You always want to somehow go into it - as its the main combo starter nowadays. Since he's a level six synchro, the two obvious tuners that you will search for are <a data-name=""Crimson Resonator"">Crimson Resonator</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a>. Luckily, they both have an effect which allows them to bring out more monsters, so you wont struggle to start-up your combo.  The new spell card - <a data-name=""Command Resonator"">Command Resonator</a> - allows you to search a level four fiend. What you search varies heavily on what you're hand or field is. If played well, you could get up to this point without using your Normal Summon. If you're going second against a backrow deck: Traptrix, True Draco, Artifact, etc - you can automatically spin your opponents backrow on summon using the effect of <a data-name=""Holding Legs"">Holding Legs</a>. Since its a level four, you can use both it and a resonator for <a data-name=""Red Rising Drago"">Red Rising Drago</a>n - to start your entire combo. It being a fiend also makes it searchable off of the spell, which comes in handy.  After that its simple. Just try to make as many disruptions as you can.<a data-name=""Hot red Dragon Archfiend Abyss""> Hot red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a> allows you to negate a Spell/Trap. <a data-name=""Red Rain"">Red Rain</a> allows you to nuke your opponents monsters during their turn, and adds itself back to hand when you Synchro Summon another monster.  Overall; this deck deserves a 7.5/10. Its very, <em>very </em>consistant, and will almost always get you two formidable synchro monsters on field + a bunch of negates in your spell and trap zone. Recommend this to players just starting yugioh or people without a deck ready for Master Rule 5."

The only comparable with IB combo decks. Which makes this deck one of the top leaders. Thanks to the application ""Primathmech Alembertian""certainly we not stuck with unwanted equipe spell in hand. I personally do not use FTK deks (except test) I prefer LOCKDOWN ;)  TACTICS - In simple words, the most important thing we need, are 3 cards which you can put Bushido Counter (one of them must be ""gateway of the six""). Then we can conduct infinite ADD SS loop. At the beginning we should activate cards we cen put Bushido Counter on them. Secondly SS ""Great General of the Six Samurai"". Use him add ""gateway of the six"" and activate. 2 more SS under the arrows ""Great General of the Six Samurai"" (in the meantime we add monters using cards with Bushido Counter - beyond I won't mention it anymore). From this 2 monsters we SS ""Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights"" we add monster and use her SS effect, SS monster under the arrows ""Great General of the Six Samurai"". More 2 SS six samurai and we SS ""saryuja skull dread"" and we use him 2 effects. If we don't have 3 cards which we can put Bushido Counter more SS Six Samurai and ""saryuja skull dread"". Once we get 3 cards which you can put Bushido Counter we can conduct infinite ADD SS loop. And we go to the right combo. 3 SS ""Kizan"" we SS ""Primathmech Alembertian"" we add ""Amazon archer"" and SS. Next SS tribute loop. <div class=""ZUo4Ze""> <div>All mine decks are well tested and optimized in terms of draw power, dead hand, synergy. balance &amp; combo.  All this to give you the best possible version of selected deck.</div> </div> Please check my other decks.

The fact of the matter is, for the foreseeable future (until the next ban list) we have this deck slated at the top.  &nbsp;  <span>Basic Combo:</span>  • Open one of your 3 starters (1 ROTA [goes into 2 of your starters], 1 <a data-name=""Armageddon Knight"">Armageddon Knight</a>, 1 <a data-name=""Dark Grepher"">Dark Grepher</a>, 2 <a data-name=""Mathematician"">Mathematician</a>)  --&gt; Alternatively, you can open one any other monster that can be Normal Summoned + <a data-name=""Foolish"">Foolish</a>  [Step 1]: Normal Starter, then foolish <a data-name=""Harp Horror"">Harp Horror</a>  [Step 2]: Banish Harp to Special <a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare</a> from Deck  [Step 3]: Make <a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automaton"">Galatea, the Orcust Automaton</a> with Knightmare &amp; your Normal Summon  [Step 4]: Use Galatea to shuffle your banished Harp, setting <a data-name=""Orcustrated Babel"">Orcustrated Babel</a>  [Step 5]: Banish Knightmare in GY to send <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Wand&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Wand""</a> from your Deck to the GY  [Step 6]: Use ""World Wand"" to Special Summon the banished Knightmare  [Step 7]: Make <a data-name=""Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star"">Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star</a> using Galatea, and attach the banished ""World Wand""  [Step 8]: Make I:P <a data-name=""Masquerena"">Masquerena</a> using Dingirsu and the Knightmare  [Step 9]: Activate your Set Babel and win the Duel (you can send either Harp or Cymbal to the GY off your Knightmare; sending Harp during your opponent's turn allows you to Special Cymbal from Deck which enables your I:P to get out Knightmare Unicorn, after which you can banish the Cymbal in GY to Special Summon Dingirsu --&gt; you can also send Cymbal instead to Summon a Galatea for a Link 4 play, or Dingirsu for an earlier disruption, from which you can make Knightmare Unicorn with I:P).  &nbsp;  <span>Cards that should be considered:</span>  • Handtraps: Phantazmay, D.D. Crow, Skull Meister, Ash, Imperm, Nibiru, Veiler  --&gt; I'm not a fan of Phantazmay, but it is a solid card this format (especially in this deck)  --&gt; not a fan of main deck skull meister unless you're certain you'll be facing Orcust; crow follows the same theory (but it's weaker vs. Orcust)  • Additional options: ""Into the Void"" is ok if you're not running hand traps (so not this variant), Dangers! can be ok in some variants of Orcust (not this variant), going 2nd cards can be good (if you're into that sort of thing), and more Striker cards can also be good as they offer versatility going 1st &amp; 2nd (really solid if you opt to go that route here, but don't overdo it). Also, as pointed out by a member in the comments, it is worth considering the scrap engine:  &nbsp;  <span>Continued Deck Theory:</span>  • Why are the Striker cards good here?: You'll often find that the Striker engine really only serves 2 purposes in any given Orcust deck. To offer an extension with desperately bad hands (see hornet drones), and to offer disruption (see widow anchor/shark cannon). What makes these cards even better, however, is that when you're not drawing into them - you're likely drawing a way into them (@engage). Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage! doesn't just give you access to an incredible toolbox, it also stacks advantage by drawing a free card when activated with 3 or more spells in the GY (which is easy enough when you run 18 spells, of which most are draw cards). Having said all of that, it is worth noting that the Sky Striker cards do have a major drawback. When your field is clogged up with monsters in the Main Monster Zones, it is all but impossible to rely on the Sky Striker cards. What Orcust does exceptionally well, that allows it to play around this conditional disadvantage, is that it is capable of committing massive resources with ease &amp; that it is capable of moving key pieces of its engine to the GY. These two factors ensure that when a Sky Striker card is needed, it is usually accessible.  • What else should be considered in the Striker package?: Shizuku has a lot going for it in this Deck, but I simply didn't like the idea of playing it over Topologic Bomber Dragon. Shizuku doesn't offer the same explosive disruption as Bomber, but it does allow you to dig into your Sky Striker engine (which may end up being useful for going 2nd). In addition to Shizuku, Jamming Waves &amp; Afterburners are also worth considering. Both of these cards are strictly for going 2nd/breaking a board, and they are relatively useful in doing so - however they do not see play in this Deck, or really any variations of this deck, because they are inconsistent outside of these situations. Not to mention, Orcust is a deck that is relatively resilient, and going 2nd it can OTK with ease - so main decking bricky options to break a board may not be the best option."

Very fun for locals - and very quick to pick up. Hope you have a wonderful new year using this,"I want to start today's deck overview with wishing everyone a Happy New Year. I wish all of you a great 2020 - and remember to keep on being the awesome duelists you all are. Anyways - I'd like to start 2020 with this cheap and <em>quite</em> rogue deck build I made a while back. It focus' on continuously manipulating your opponents field by destroying cards they control.  On first glance; this deck might seem cloggy and weak (with the only two monsters in it being <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a>) However, I assure you that using all the search and draw power in this deck - you open up with an ideal hand quite regularly. This deck requires you to only have two cards in hand for you to pull your combo off.  You usually end up only having <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> on field - as you use Rod as fodder for <a data-name=""Illusion Magic"">Illusion Magic</a> - which allows you to run a Phantasm Spiral 'engine'. The way <a data-name=""Pacifis, the Phantasm City"">Pacifis, the Phantasm City</a> works is, if you dont control any effect monsters - you can special summon one 'Pacifis Token' to your side of the field with 2000 ATK. Then, when you special that token, you're allowed to add a Phantasm trap to your hand. This give you extra disruption alongside <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> meaning you can stack up ways to destroy your opponents cards - spell, trap or monster.  You can also overlay into <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon</a> using two of your magicians (If of course you haven't banished it off of <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>). Then you can use a card like circle to pop your dragon - which will bring out <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> from the extra.  To wrap it up; I have fallen in love with this deck. It's so interesting and different - and a good refresher from all these current format decks. The playstyle is different, the strategy is different. It strays away from the classic <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> decks, but in a unique and positive way. I'd give this deck a 8/10. Definitely not the strongest deck out there - but a very budget and very fun deck to play (for your opponent and you). Happy New Year everyone; hope 2020 brings you lots of joy and a whole lot of dueling."

I've been building and testing decks lately that can most utilize the Master Rule update and this one has some real potential. It's remarkably consistent, amazingly recurrable, and fun (at least for you). The deck can easily play through and stop disruptions and nearly every hand can get you AT LEAST a toad + disruption and at most ends on multiple negates.  &nbsp;  Card Choices and Strategy:  &nbsp;  -3x Right-Hand Shark: Adds Left-Hand Shark on normal. Water XYZ monsters summoned with it as material can't be destroyed by batter, which might keep a floating Bahamut Shark alive for more Toads next turn.  -1x Left-Hand Shark: Can be Specialled from the hand for Star Boy Material or dumped to the grave and summoned for free for XYZ spam.  3x Cutter Shark: 1 card Toad/Dweller/Anything you want.  2x Lantern Shark: On normal Specials another water from hand. 2 is enough.  2x XYZ Remora: Summon Dreadnaught, Detectch 2, and get 3 Sharks on field for more plays. 3 bricks. At worst, it's another lvl 4 Water.  1x Double Fin Shark: Specials a Fish from grave When Normal. Drawing 1 is good. Drawing 2 or more is awful.  3x White Stingray: It summons itself from the hand by pitching a water, which other cards can take advantage of.  3x Silent Angler: Summons itself from the hand for free. (Make sure you summon it last as it locks you out of summoning from the hand)  2X Aqua Spirit: Level 4 Water that Easily summons itself.  1x Tenyi Spirit: Level 4 Water that Easily summons itself.  3x White Mirror: It's Monster Reborn + ROTA for the deck. It's busted.  2x Water Hazard: Get's you another monster on field. It's decent Negate-bait as well.  3x Instant Fusion: Get's you another Level 4 water or Millennium Eyes Restrict to stop handtraps.  1x Monster Reborn: No introduction needed.  3x Crossout Designator: Ya, you probably forgot about this one. Read it again. It's called by the grave that can negate called by the grave. It's the reason for the strange one of's at the end. Outside of the mirror match, here's all of the relevant targets in the deck - Instant Fusion, Monster Reborn, Pot of Desires, Ash Blossom, Effect Veiler, Called by the Grave, Infinite Impermanence, and even Double or Nothing. If you are skeptical of the card choice, just try it out. I've had a lot of success with it. Take it out and clean up the handtrap ratio's if you don't like it.  &nbsp;  ---Extra Deck---  Room is tight here. Toads can add back Themselves and Bahamut Sharks as needed (You can easily summon many in a duel). Feel free to test other options, but these 15 cards were the best choice.  ---Side Deck---  Put in whatever you prefer.  &nbsp;  If you check the deck out, please feel free to leave any suggestions/opinions in the comments.

The guardians are very difficult to summon because of their equip cards. Of course in the anime, Rafael uses the anime-only card Backup Gardna to transfer equip cards. I tried to make the deck somewhat competitive in video games like Legacy of the Duelist, so this is what I got. It's not designed to win you any tournaments, but to have some fun playing like Rafael.  Yes, I know Pot of Greed is on the banlist, but this deck is so problematic, it's not going to help you win much. The ideal first play in this deck is activating Seal of Orichalcos and then special summoning Eatos with no monsters in the graveyard. If you special summon Eatos and then activate the Seal, Eatos will be destroyed. Swords is a great stall card while you use cards like Arsenal Summoner to search your deck. Pot of Avarice is there to keep the graveyard clear for Eatos. It's also great to use Shrink after an opponent's monster declares an attack to destroy it.  I really tried to include Elma in this deck, but it makes it very problematic. Even if you were somehow able to summon her with her Equip card attached and the Seal activated, you would have a monster with 2100 attack. That's what Arsenal Summoner gives you, and Knight Day Grepher with 100 more attack, both having better abilities of adding a card you want to your hand.  Let me know in the comments if you have a better Rafael deck."
