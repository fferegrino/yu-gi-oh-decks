There clearly cards designed for them and play at such a different access to other decks. I think most of the reputation built on trap decks is simply due to price. Many people have to spend ludicrous amounts of money and a whole bunch of hours on their decks only for it to suddenly have no way to play around a deck that's half the price that simply wasn't considered. (On some level I think that was designed with that in mind. I mean what would be a greater deterrent to building a budget deck than to be constantly lambasted by the community for playing the only deck you can afford. But that's just my conspirational thinking) However there is a level of empowerment felt when you take a bunch of terrible commons together to use their unique effects to overcome the odds and win in a new way your opponent could have expected. So dont feel bad for playing a deck with an alternate win-con, feel bad for the poor players who were pier pressured into paying over $1,000 for $15 prizing and bragging rights at a run-down local.</p><p>Any here's what most players call Nurse Burn. This deck uses Darklord Nurse Reficule and Bad Reaction to Simochi to transform all of your healing traps into burn traps. So long as you have any combination of 3 of the trap cards set you can easily K.O on the subsequent turn of your opponent's draw step. I am not as familiar with side decks with burn cards as I am with most other decks, but I assume it establishes powerful board breakers as your opponent will likely opt to make you go second. I'm mostly using the side deck to showcase Condemned Witch. It has some unique search effects with the forbidden items which each individually have really powerful effects and can Lonefire blossom itself into Darklord Nurse Reficule.&nbsp;</p>"

One of Red-Eyes largest downside is the massive amounts of level 6 and 7 monster you need if you want to keep a lot of fusion and XYZ monsters on the field. Another big downside is the 50/50 first hand casual Red-Eyes decks usually have and I believe I have remedied this issue with this deck.</p><p>Notes (differences from a casual Red-Eyes Deck):</p><p>1. Instead of worry about summoning anything lower than a level 6 monster from the hand I have outright removed every Red-Eyes card that below level 6, all of them (except the Black Stone of Legend, are useless and waste space)</p><p>2. All Fusion monster come straight from the deck or graveyard via Necro Fusion or Red-Eyes Fusion, any other method of Fusion is unviable with this high a level of monster.</p><p>3. Red-Eyes souls can be summoned if you get turn two from the hand which allows for powerful XYZ options in combination with a Fusion Monster.</p><p>General Turn Starters:</p><p>Red-Eyes Fusion &gt; Meteor Black Comet Dragon (using a Red-Eyes Black Meteor Dragon) &gt; Next turn using Black Meteor's effect</p><p>Red-Eyes Insight &gt; Red-Eyes Fusions sending Black Meteor to graveyard</p><p>Dragon Shrine &gt; Red-Eye BD. and BMD. to Graveyard</p><p>Set Necro Fusions &gt; Various Card Effects to get a stash in graveyard</p><p>This deck is generally good at both turns but with my experience with it, its better off going first to get a better chance of Necro Fusion going through.</p>"
