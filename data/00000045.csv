There clearly cards designed for them and play at such a different access to other decks. I think most of the reputation built on trap decks is simply due to price. Many people have to spend ludicrous amounts of money and a whole bunch of hours on their decks only for it to suddenly have no way to play around a deck that's half the price that simply wasn't considered. (On some level I think that was designed with that in mind. I mean what would be a greater deterrent to building a budget deck than to be constantly lambasted by the community for playing the only deck you can afford. But that's just my conspirational thinking) However there is a level of empowerment felt when you take a bunch of terrible commons together to use their unique effects to overcome the odds and win in a new way your opponent could have expected. So dont feel bad for playing a deck with an alternate win-con, feel bad for the poor players who were pier pressured into paying over $1,000 for $15 prizing and bragging rights at a run-down local.</p><p>Any here's what most players call Nurse Burn. This deck uses Darklord Nurse Reficule and Bad Reaction to Simochi to transform all of your healing traps into burn traps. So long as you have any combination of 3 of the trap cards set you can easily K.O on the subsequent turn of your opponent's draw step. I am not as familiar with side decks with burn cards as I am with most other decks, but I assume it establishes powerful board breakers as your opponent will likely opt to make you go second. I'm mostly using the side deck to showcase Condemned Witch. It has some unique search effects with the forbidden items which each individually have really powerful effects and can Lonefire blossom itself into Darklord Nurse Reficule.&nbsp;</p>"

One of Red-Eyes largest downside is the massive amounts of level 6 and 7 monster you need if you want to keep a lot of fusion and XYZ monsters on the field. Another big downside is the 50/50 first hand casual Red-Eyes decks usually have and I believe I have remedied this issue with this deck.</p><p>Notes (differences from a casual Red-Eyes Deck):</p><p>1. Instead of worry about summoning anything lower than a level 6 monster from the hand I have outright removed every Red-Eyes card that below level 6, all of them (except the Black Stone of Legend, are useless and waste space)</p><p>2. All Fusion monster come straight from the deck or graveyard via Necro Fusion or Red-Eyes Fusion, any other method of Fusion is unviable with this high a level of monster.</p><p>3. Red-Eyes souls can be summoned if you get turn two from the hand which allows for powerful XYZ options in combination with a Fusion Monster.</p><p>General Turn Starters:</p><p>Red-Eyes Fusion &gt; Meteor Black Comet Dragon (using a Red-Eyes Black Meteor Dragon) &gt; Next turn using Black Meteor's effect</p><p>Red-Eyes Insight &gt; Red-Eyes Fusions sending Black Meteor to graveyard</p><p>Dragon Shrine &gt; Red-Eye BD. and BMD. to Graveyard</p><p>Set Necro Fusions &gt; Various Card Effects to get a stash in graveyard</p><p>This deck is generally good at both turns but with my experience with it, its better off going first to get a better chance of Necro Fusion going through.</p>"

There is no mainline ""combo"" to this deck - the gameplay is mostly dependent on situational decisions done by the pilot.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">First, you break your opponent's board, which is done&nbsp;by using any of the 12 boardbreakers in the deck. Also, Horus cards inherently break boards in-engine, whether its through the battlephase with King's Sarcophagus when attacking with any Horus monster. Nadir Servant also can use the variety of Extra Deck monster ammunition for a toolbox of removal effects, like N'tss destruction and Malong's bounce.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Second, you establish your board and gamestate. The Horus cards fill the graveyard, set Canopic Protector for limitless summons, and maybe set up negates in the form of Hope Harbinger or Photon Lord (now affordable in the TCG thanks to Battles of Legend: Chapter 1!)</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If Canopic Protector is set up on your field, you can use all your Horus monsters to make Rank 8 plays or Link plays with I:P + S:P to bring all your Horus monsters in the GY. Canopic Protector will summon them all from the GY anyways when your opponent activates any monster effect!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">From that set-up, you should be able to play a decent and powerful game of Yugioh with Anti-Meta Horus. Horus cards are surprisingly and ridiculously hard to remove easily due to their effects triggering whenever a card on the field is removed by card effect! Imsety sends a card to the GY, Qebehsenuef protects from targeting, Hapi recovers 2 from Banishment/GY, and Duamutef draws up to 5 cards! King's Sarcophagus protects Horus monsters from destruction unless they are targeted, so cards like Mirrorjade, Raigeki and Lightning Storm don't do much. Finally, Canopic Protector basically is ""soul charge"" for Horus, summoning Horus monsters everytime your opponent does anything!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This deck is an anti-meta deck designed&nbsp;to counter the handtrap-heavy meta that is rampant in the TCG right now - and both Dogmatika and Horus strategies shrug off almost every handtrap thown at them. Impermanence, Effect Veiler, Ghost Belle, Nibiru and Droll all get easily dealt with if you sequence your cards right.

Koga is also more viable now that almost half of our HEROs are Light attribute (WK LV6 counts!). Chaos Angel instead of Masked HERO Acid because of WK LV6 and Malicious both being, well, LV6; this would make for some interesting Plan Bs if you can get either out with a Vyon or Shadow Mist that has been hand-trapped and you dont want to go into Little Knight for whatever reason. Either Vyon or Shadow Mist + WK LV6 would summon Chaos Angel with both passive protections added.

Then you will have a 6 card hand with slifer on the field and feel very powerful and can get him back on the turn after and go for the kill.<br /><br />Purpose of certain cards:<br /><br />Goal: getting slifer trap<br /><br />-3 trap tricks, so you have 6 total cards in the deck that can get you Slifer reving from the graveyard plus drawing till you reach 6 cards in hand. You will basically be just as likely as puling one of these cards as getting an ash or maxx c when you have 3 of each, so the consistancy is pretty good for getting a slifer trap.<br />-I run 3 of Albion the shrouded dragon because it is a cheap draw 1 card, and it sends a card to the graveyard, thus increasing the chances of drawing a slifer trap/trap trix or a path to branded fusion.<br />-magical mallet is there just for extra chances to pull the card you need, you can adjust it as necasary<br /><br />Goal: getting slifer in the graveyard<br /><br />-branded fusion, this is the heart of the slifer deck, as it lets you fusion into brigrand glory dragon, which lets you send slifer to the grave yard. As a bonus, brigrand protects all your monsters from being targeted with monster effects, so it is an added protection to your slifer.<br /><br />-foolish burial, basically if you draw this card you don't need branded fusion for slifer and can essentially do a normal or full branded despia combo bc slifer is already in the graveyard.<br /><br />Goal getting branded fusion:<br /><br />-springans kitt if normal or special summoned, lets you add branded fusion to your hand and return another card from your hand to the deck.<br /><br />-albur the jester of despia lets you search branded fusion and add it to your hand<br /><br />-predaplant verte anaconda, if you have neither of the above than all you have to do is get 2 monsters on the field, then you can link summon verte and use it to get branded fusions ability<br /><br /><br />Extenders:<br /><br />-Branded in red: is really good if you already get to branded fusion and have a slifer trap related card in hand, it essentially allows you, after you get slifer in the grave and brigrand on the field, to extend into getting another fusion monster on the field, I often do iceblade.<br /><br />-blazing cartesia, is nice because if you use Albion the shrouded dragon to send albaz to the GY or you use incredible ecclesia to get albaz on the field she is a special summon. You can use her to get into a link 2 verte, if you dont have a card that searches it, or she can extend you into an extra fusion summon.<br /><br />-branded opening is nice in the GY, for protection from your fusion monsters from getting destroyed.<br /><br />If you dont want to build a whole branded deck and just want to play slifer, the only extra deck UR monster you need is predaplant verte for consistancy. If you want to run a weak branded, albian the branded dragon or lubellion the searching dragon, plus ice jade is all you really need.<br /><br />For the main deck the only UR you need is branded fusion and the 3 slifer trap cards for consistancy, and 3 slifer. having all 3 slifer traps makes a huge difference for consistancy and fun.<br /><br />right now in master duel branded fusion is limited to 1, and jester is limited to 2,<br /><br />If you dont have alot of these UR or SR cards, feel free to use generic card drawers like magical mallet, reloaded, or others that you have to draw more cards, or just fill it with staples/generic good cards. You can also replace alot of the non jester, springan kitt, albaz, and albion, branded or depsia cards with Egyptian God themed cards. <br />Egyptian God themed cards are only good if you draw slifer in your hand, which is hard because slifer cannot be searched. But if you draw slifer and one of the egyptian God themed cards, it helps you to get tributes to normal/tribute summon slifer. But this is the main reason branded is good, because you will basically get slifer every other game, whereas without branded its super rare to get him because foolish burial is limited to 1 and slifer cant be searched.</p>"

This is mainly done with the 12 searchers this deck has access to, that being Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall, Blue-Sky, Orcust Girsu, and World Legacy's Memory. <br /><br />Hard-to-out extra deck bosses are usually the win condition in this deck, like a I:P Masquereena boosted Avramax, an untargetable/undestroyable Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme or the column-dependent battle phase champion Mekk-Knight Morning Star.</p><p><br />In a simplified gamestate vacuum, Mekk-Knight Avramax is nigh-unkillable and often is a ""checkmate"" on your opponent.

If you're brave enough or have experienced friends you can rely on, don't let me scare you from having a great time (3/5 difficulty)!&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, let's get started on the deck's strategies!</p><p>First, the way this deck wants to win comes in two separate flavors: Amano-Iwato is a barrier that restricts monster effects; and the two aces, Shinobaron Peacock and Shinobaroness Peacock, can sweep up any remaining board presence your opponent can have when they are uninterrupted. The ritual Ace monsters are easy to understand, so the discussion will mainly revolve around playing with Amano-Iwato. Here are some sample combos to get each of them set-up!</p><p>Aratama + Stars Align Above the Shrine: Use Aratama's effect to add Sakitama, use the effect of Sakitama to summon itself by revealing it, use the field spell ""Stars Align Above the Shrine"" to tribute Sakitama on the field to Ritual Summon ""Shinobaroness Shade Peacock"" or ""Shinobaron Shade Peacock."" Getting to these smaller ritual monsters helps you find ways to reach either win condition.</p><p>Shinobaron Shade Peacock: It's effect to tribute itself to get both a ritual spell and a ritual monster in hand is incredibly powerful. In most cases, you can use it to grab both ""Shinobaroness Shade Peacock"" and ""Shinobird Calling"", then use Shinobird Calling to ritual summon ""Shinobaroness Shade Peacock"" by banishing the ""Shinobaron Shade Peacock"" you used to find them. If you need to start an offense however, you can easily reach into a ""Shinobaron Peacock"" or a ""Shinobaroness Peacock"" to threaten your opponent's resources.</p><p>IMPORTANT: ""Stars Align Across the Milky Way"" can be accessed by having ""Stars Align Above the Shrine"" on the field when you leave a ritual monster face-up at the End Phase. This occurs because they are spirit monsters and return to the hand at the End Phase. It is also important because it is the more consistent way to reach Amano-Iwato with its secondary effect in the Graveyard. By banishing that trap card, you can ritual summon a monster from your hand (which needs to be Shinobaron Peacock or Shinobaroness Peacock for maximum impact), resolve its effects to return cards to the deck then Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Spirit Monster by dodging the conventional means applied to them. If your opponent often leads their combo with monsters, go for ""Shinobaron Peacock"" and try to set up with Amano-Iwato in the hand for a Special Summon! You can do this more easily by using ""Shinobaroness Shade Peacock"" to add ""Shinobird Power Spot"" to your hand, activating it, and having it's effect occur alongside your field spell at the End Phase.</p><p>But sometimes you can get lucky, and Amano-Iwato can start in your hand with the Yata Mirror equip spell. This can be deadly enough for plenty of decks if you are going first. If you have Amano-Iwato in hand and ""Sakitama"" + ""Stars Align Above the Shrine,"" you can always try to cheese its staying power by ritual summoning into ""Shinobaroness Shade Peacock"" to get the mirror, then use Sakitama to add it itself to your hand, then summon out Amano-Iwato with its other effect.</p><p>Once you're proficient in this deck's combos, you may find yourself trying to finish the game with as little wiggle-room for your opponent. You can use ""Yata-Garasu"" to lock your opponent from making a comeback once you clean their field using either Ace Ritual monster(s).</p><p>How does the Extra Deck Work?: Sometimes your opponent has ways that can turn your unlucky hand upside down with an interruption. Many of the cards here (Abyss Dweller, Giant Hand, etc.) offer a field presence to hopefully survive until you can attempt another game-winning move. Many will know what ""Divine Arsenal AA-Zeus Sky Thunder"" does, but just in case- it offers another way to clear the board if you can successfully battle (and not destroy) your XYZ monsters. Every ""Knightmare"" card in the Extra Deck offers a new form of removal at the cost of effect monsters on your field and a card in your hand. Link Spider? Your combo will sometimes naturally make cute tokens to protect your lifepoints or can used as tributes for the ritual monsters in your hand. By link summoning ""Link Spider"" with one of the tokens, you will be one requirement closer to a ""Knightmare"" when you need it.</p><p>Elder Entity N'tss does not actually accompolish anything in the Deck on its own. But there are a few strategies that attempt to send your Extra Deck cards to the GY - and this can be a surprising punish.</p><p>The Side Deck?: These cards chosen naturally boost the initial given strategy in their own unique ways while being powerful staple cards that can be splashed or explored in other archetypes. It serves more as a preview of ways you could adjust the deck or lean into other exciting strategies instead. ""Dogmatika"" can be a ritual archetype to consider when looking to give your ritual summons a more diverse impact (They will also utilize the N'tss in the Extra Deck a lot more efficiently too!). Harpies often boost Wind attribute strategies that stuck to the original concept of wind monsters having benefits for returning to your hand to roost. And lastly, explosive cards such as ""Evenly Matched"" and ""Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju"" are obscure methods of removing problem cards from your opponent's field in ways that are hard to block without utilizing a ton of their prepared resources and makes your Going Second turns with your Ritual Monsters even more potent!</p><p>This deck is built to carry plenty of splashable cards that make building other decks easier, alongside being cheaper than any given meta, and flexible enough to grow alongside an attentive player. Whether a new player, returning from an ancient memory of the game, or a coming back after a monthly break, I think you'll find this deck to be the perfect match navigating through the modern era of Yugioh.</p>"

It's also got incredible control capabilities and can start growing out of hand with power over time thanks to its leveling system. Dealing with it isn't a cakewalk either, Shining Sarcophagus is indestructible to monster effects and the swordsman can negate anything that targets it as well!</p><p>And despite being control oriented it even has a consistent way to win! When the time is right you can use the sarcophagus's search effect to grab gandora, gandora will summon itself and bomb everything (except shining sarcophagus) and summon another monster from your deck and level it up based on how many cards were destroyed! Destroy enough cards&nbsp;and summon swordsman or magician and it'll be an otk!</p>"

Chaos becomes DM on the field and graveyard making him accessible from eternal soul and has a nasty effect that paired with dark magic circle can destroy 1 and banish 1 card every turn. dragoon lets you hit your opponent twice for damage by destroying the monster first then inflicting its original attack as point damage two times a turn plus can still attack normally as well.

While it may not be a top-tier deck, it can still perform well in events. Since the ban of Master Peace, the deck has relied more on floodgates, such as Skill Drain and Boarder. I have been testing and playing this deck at various events, facing opponents with different decks, and has had mostly even or positive scores, with some near undefeated performances. Decks i played angainst were like Labrynth, Mannadium or even Snake-Eyes. The deck's strength lies in its ability to survive the first turn and generate advantage through Draco monsters and disruptive plays with Summons, Protected by Diagram and Dreiath. With the help of cards like Strike of the Monarchs, the deck can navigate through opposing boards and build its own. Even though you could also play cards like Forbidden Droplet. Although it is not a top meta deck, i still recommend True Draco for its affordable price and personal enjoyment.</p>"

Yes. Should you play it without the Horus cards? Better not. Nevertheless, here is a list without Horus. I've been playing this list for some time now and even though it lacks the consistency of the Horus cards, this deck can play very well without them. The Danger Monsters are there to guide the deck into plays as well as possible and with Nessie and 2 Destrudo we have easy ways to go into Baronne, for example, to enable fusion plays. If you want to play Guardian Chimera you should play KOTS plus Poly. I play the Shaddoll Engine more in the main, but since we want the maximum of good draws and mills, the Shaddoll Fusions are in the side for the fire match-ups. Bigfoot in the side deck represents the Going Second Danger monsters you could play. In my opinion one of the very good approaches of a non Horus version of Tear, but if you have the Horus cards you should play them.</p>"
