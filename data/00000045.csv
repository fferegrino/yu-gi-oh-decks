There clearly cards designed for them and play at such a different access to other decks. I think most of the reputation built on trap decks is simply due to price. Many people have to spend ludicrous amounts of money and a whole bunch of hours on their decks only for it to suddenly have no way to play around a deck that's half the price that simply wasn't considered. (On some level I think that was designed with that in mind. I mean what would be a greater deterrent to building a budget deck than to be constantly lambasted by the community for playing the only deck you can afford. But that's just my conspirational thinking) However there is a level of empowerment felt when you take a bunch of terrible commons together to use their unique effects to overcome the odds and win in a new way your opponent could have expected. So dont feel bad for playing a deck with an alternate win-con, feel bad for the poor players who were pier pressured into paying over $1,000 for $15 prizing and bragging rights at a run-down local.</p><p>Any here's what most players call Nurse Burn. This deck uses Darklord Nurse Reficule and Bad Reaction to Simochi to transform all of your healing traps into burn traps. So long as you have any combination of 3 of the trap cards set you can easily K.O on the subsequent turn of your opponent's draw step. I am not as familiar with side decks with burn cards as I am with most other decks, but I assume it establishes powerful board breakers as your opponent will likely opt to make you go second. I'm mostly using the side deck to showcase Condemned Witch. It has some unique search effects with the forbidden items which each individually have really powerful effects and can Lonefire blossom itself into Darklord Nurse Reficule.&nbsp;</p>"

One of Red-Eyes largest downside is the massive amounts of level 6 and 7 monster you need if you want to keep a lot of fusion and XYZ monsters on the field. Another big downside is the 50/50 first hand casual Red-Eyes decks usually have and I believe I have remedied this issue with this deck.</p><p>Notes (differences from a casual Red-Eyes Deck):</p><p>1. Instead of worry about summoning anything lower than a level 6 monster from the hand I have outright removed every Red-Eyes card that below level 6, all of them (except the Black Stone of Legend, are useless and waste space)</p><p>2. All Fusion monster come straight from the deck or graveyard via Necro Fusion or Red-Eyes Fusion, any other method of Fusion is unviable with this high a level of monster.</p><p>3. Red-Eyes souls can be summoned if you get turn two from the hand which allows for powerful XYZ options in combination with a Fusion Monster.</p><p>General Turn Starters:</p><p>Red-Eyes Fusion &gt; Meteor Black Comet Dragon (using a Red-Eyes Black Meteor Dragon) &gt; Next turn using Black Meteor's effect</p><p>Red-Eyes Insight &gt; Red-Eyes Fusions sending Black Meteor to graveyard</p><p>Dragon Shrine &gt; Red-Eye BD. and BMD. to Graveyard</p><p>Set Necro Fusions &gt; Various Card Effects to get a stash in graveyard</p><p>This deck is generally good at both turns but with my experience with it, its better off going first to get a better chance of Necro Fusion going through.</p>"

There is no mainline ""combo"" to this deck - the gameplay is mostly dependent on situational decisions done by the pilot.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">First, you break your opponent's board, which is done&nbsp;by using any of the 12 boardbreakers in the deck. Also, Horus cards inherently break boards in-engine, whether its through the battlephase with King's Sarcophagus when attacking with any Horus monster. Nadir Servant also can use the variety of Extra Deck monster ammunition for a toolbox of removal effects, like N'tss destruction and Malong's bounce.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Second, you establish your board and gamestate. The Horus cards fill the graveyard, set Canopic Protector for limitless summons, and maybe set up negates in the form of Hope Harbinger or Photon Lord (now affordable in the TCG thanks to Battles of Legend: Chapter 1!)</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If Canopic Protector is set up on your field, you can use all your Horus monsters to make Rank 8 plays or Link plays with I:P + S:P to bring all your Horus monsters in the GY. Canopic Protector will summon them all from the GY anyways when your opponent activates any monster effect!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">From that set-up, you should be able to play a decent and powerful game of Yugioh with Anti-Meta Horus. Horus cards are surprisingly and ridiculously hard to remove easily due to their effects triggering whenever a card on the field is removed by card effect! Imsety sends a card to the GY, Qebehsenuef protects from targeting, Hapi recovers 2 from Banishment/GY, and Duamutef draws up to 5 cards! King's Sarcophagus protects Horus monsters from destruction unless they are targeted, so cards like Mirrorjade, Raigeki and Lightning Storm don't do much. Finally, Canopic Protector basically is ""soul charge"" for Horus, summoning Horus monsters everytime your opponent does anything!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This deck is an anti-meta deck designed&nbsp;to counter the handtrap-heavy meta that is rampant in the TCG right now - and both Dogmatika and Horus strategies shrug off almost every handtrap thown at them. Impermanence, Effect Veiler, Ghost Belle, Nibiru and Droll all get easily dealt with if you sequence your cards right.

Koga is also more viable now that almost half of our HEROs are Light attribute (WK LV6 counts!). Chaos Angel instead of Masked HERO Acid because of WK LV6 and Malicious both being, well, LV6; this would make for some interesting Plan Bs if you can get either out with a Vyon or Shadow Mist that has been hand-trapped and you dont want to go into Little Knight for whatever reason. Either Vyon or Shadow Mist + WK LV6 would summon Chaos Angel with both passive protections added.

Then you will have a 6 card hand with slifer on the field and feel very powerful and can get him back on the turn after and go for the kill.<br /><br />Purpose of certain cards:<br /><br />Goal: getting slifer trap<br /><br />-3 trap tricks, so you have 6 total cards in the deck that can get you Slifer reving from the graveyard plus drawing till you reach 6 cards in hand. You will basically be just as likely as puling one of these cards as getting an ash or maxx c when you have 3 of each, so the consistancy is pretty good for getting a slifer trap.<br />-I run 3 of Albion the shrouded dragon because it is a cheap draw 1 card, and it sends a card to the graveyard, thus increasing the chances of drawing a slifer trap/trap trix or a path to branded fusion.<br />-magical mallet is there just for extra chances to pull the card you need, you can adjust it as necasary<br /><br />Goal: getting slifer in the graveyard<br /><br />-branded fusion, this is the heart of the slifer deck, as it lets you fusion into brigrand glory dragon, which lets you send slifer to the grave yard. As a bonus, brigrand protects all your monsters from being targeted with monster effects, so it is an added protection to your slifer.<br /><br />-foolish burial, basically if you draw this card you don't need branded fusion for slifer and can essentially do a normal or full branded despia combo bc slifer is already in the graveyard.<br /><br />Goal getting branded fusion:<br /><br />-springans kitt if normal or special summoned, lets you add branded fusion to your hand and return another card from your hand to the deck.<br /><br />-albur the jester of despia lets you search branded fusion and add it to your hand<br /><br />-predaplant verte anaconda, if you have neither of the above than all you have to do is get 2 monsters on the field, then you can link summon verte and use it to get branded fusions ability<br /><br /><br />Extenders:<br /><br />-Branded in red: is really good if you already get to branded fusion and have a slifer trap related card in hand, it essentially allows you, after you get slifer in the grave and brigrand on the field, to extend into getting another fusion monster on the field, I often do iceblade.<br /><br />-blazing cartesia, is nice because if you use Albion the shrouded dragon to send albaz to the GY or you use incredible ecclesia to get albaz on the field she is a special summon. You can use her to get into a link 2 verte, if you dont have a card that searches it, or she can extend you into an extra fusion summon.<br /><br />-branded opening is nice in the GY, for protection from your fusion monsters from getting destroyed.<br /><br />If you dont want to build a whole branded deck and just want to play slifer, the only extra deck UR monster you need is predaplant verte for consistancy. If you want to run a weak branded, albian the branded dragon or lubellion the searching dragon, plus ice jade is all you really need.<br /><br />For the main deck the only UR you need is branded fusion and the 3 slifer trap cards for consistancy, and 3 slifer. having all 3 slifer traps makes a huge difference for consistancy and fun.<br /><br />right now in master duel branded fusion is limited to 1, and jester is limited to 2,<br /><br />If you dont have alot of these UR or SR cards, feel free to use generic card drawers like magical mallet, reloaded, or others that you have to draw more cards, or just fill it with staples/generic good cards. You can also replace alot of the non jester, springan kitt, albaz, and albion, branded or depsia cards with Egyptian God themed cards. <br />Egyptian God themed cards are only good if you draw slifer in your hand, which is hard because slifer cannot be searched. But if you draw slifer and one of the egyptian God themed cards, it helps you to get tributes to normal/tribute summon slifer. But this is the main reason branded is good, because you will basically get slifer every other game, whereas without branded its super rare to get him because foolish burial is limited to 1 and slifer cant be searched.</p>"

This is mainly done with the 12 searchers this deck has access to, that being Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall, Blue-Sky, Orcust Girsu, and World Legacy's Memory. <br /><br />Hard-to-out extra deck bosses are usually the win condition in this deck, like a I:P Masquereena boosted Avramax, an untargetable/undestroyable Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme or the column-dependent battle phase champion Mekk-Knight Morning Star.</p><p><br />In a simplified gamestate vacuum, Mekk-Knight Avramax is nigh-unkillable and often is a ""checkmate"" on your opponent.
