This build focuses on the interaction between Geargiaccelerator, Geargiauger, and Gear Gigant X to make combos happen.  Due to Geargiaccelerator being able to loop itself via Gear Gigant X's effect if you control another Geargia monster, making three copies of Gear Gigant X is a cakewalk.  In the past, this was the point in which combos stopped, but with Megaclops, you can make that the end of combos.  Like Zoodiac, pot of avarice makes this combo repeatable.  Against combo decks, traps can slow them down to a managable pace, and a larger hand trap lineup assists if going second.  Against a back-row reliant deck, Zeus can be made.  Remember, AA-Zeus is a Machine, so it can be made under cards like Rivalry and Geargiauger.  Depending on your local meta, if you're facing more backrow faced decks, I'd recommend running spell and trap removal in the main deck, such as Heavy Storm Duster, which can be set with Trap Trick.  This deck struggles against interruption like Droll and Lock Bird, El Shaddoll Winda, Nibiru, and Summon Limit.  In terms of other engines that can be splashed, ABC, Red-Eyes, Danger, Eldlich, Numeron, and even Artifact can work.  If AA-Zeus is too expensive, I'd recommend running generic rank 4's in its place such as Abyss Dweller, Tornado Dragon, and Bagooska.  I hope that the Geargia meta can be pushed using cards like Ancient Gear Ballista and Genex Ally Birdman in the future, although I'm not sure of an end-board utilizing it."

The rest of the cards are tribute fodder or the spirit cards you plan on summoning, Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi which handloops you opponent, and Yamata dragon which draw you a bunch of cards. Sword of Kusinagi is there for piercing damage against defense position monsters (the spirits do have to inflict battle damage to your opponent to get their effects)."

If you hard draw into Deskbot 003 you go full combo, which goes as follows NS 003, SS 001, get Halq, SS other 001, get mecha phantom beast auroradran, get 3 tokens, SS 2 001, synchro 2 herald, get dugaress, detach 2 herald for two herald search + 2 cards 1 discard giving you 3 more cards (get chalislime and inception if you don't have it on hand for normal combo), use auroradran to get colt consuming 1 token and dugaress, SS 2 token, SS 2 001, Snychro Herald and Cthuaga, XYZ into Evilswarm for +1 discard and big beater, Emeral for ritual shuffle or tornado for backrow bop (which you don't need as long as you have access to bethor) + draw one card from cthuaga and get another ritual (saffira or vrash). Now it gets a bit murky depending on the game state, usually you go for chalislime to get talismanrune to get another chalislime (phaleg for OTK if you have no other way to get to her) then use inception for Vrash (chalislime and talismanrune) for board wipe if you got second (tho its unlikely you will get this through undisrutped if you go second) then go into phaleg with phul (if you have ophiel + level 8, hagith + level or just unformed in hand you can go into phul-&gt;phaleg no problem) for OTK or you go saffira (use talismanrune as fooder), get inception back to hand and go into bethor (if turn 2 to get board wipe) then go into phaleg with phul or just go into phul + extended megaltih. If you go the second route (for first turn combo) you now have mech beast auroradran + saffira + evilswarm/daigusto + phul and level 4 megalith with a hand of atleast 3. This allows you to rip 1 more card from the opponents hand during the end phase meaning if you have evilswarm it leaves them with 3 cards and it allows you to go into I:P Masquerena then go into either cerberus (with your level 4 megalith + I:P) or into unicorn during their turn making for one more draw/discard + removal or 1 pop with Cerberus. You can also get Apollousa, the bow godess into the deck and use your aurorodran + 1 megalith for a 1600 attack appolousa with 2 negates which is not that great but would leave you with Vrash/Saffira + Appolousa + Evilswarm + Whatever Megalith you still sneak on the field (optimally Phul LV8)  Not hard drawing into Deskbot 003 is not a problem either since most of the decks tools should allow you to go into phul (for bethor bop) + cerberus/unicorn (I:P masquerena knightmare during their turn) with ease and just end on that, impcantation engine can bring you to vrash pretty easily or phaleg for OTK after boardwipes with vrash or bethor.  Vrash/Saffira are entirely replacable by the way as they simply seem like the highest utility to me but feel free to use different Ritual monsters to end the games, as long as they are easily inside the range of talismandra+chalislime or even better just one of those they are worth considering. Magician of black chaos max is pretty good as you can get it with Och in the opponents turn for more disruption plays (sacrifice it or another thing on the field to disrupt opponents monster effects for a turn). I put two options in the side deck now.  Borrelsword exists for alternative OTK option, if you want easy combos to go into borrelsword replace tornado dragon or smth else with Ausha as she easily allows Link climbs. You can play accescode too but who can afford that.  Ash is mildly optional, i like it if i go second so I don't get a board of denies against me.  If you just can't get to inception for some reason to get into vrash or saffire, just go into och through ophiel search/replace. Also allows you to draw 1/discard 1.  Add a site deck that fits the meta you play in and your budget."

That was what I was thinking when I first read it.  The Deck has your average <strong>Buster Blader</strong> monsters. 3 <strong>Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordsman</strong> and 3 <strong>Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</strong>. We do need lights for <strong>Albion</strong> so we are running 1 <strong>Dogmatika Ecclesia</strong> and 1 <strong>Dogmatika Fleurdelis</strong>. 3 <strong>Ash</strong>. And since we are playing <strong>Stigmatika</strong>, we need 3 copies of <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>.  Spells and Traps are the biggest part of the deck. 3 <strong>Pot of Disparity</strong> to get to your<strong> Buster Blader</strong> or <strong>Stigmata</strong> plays. 3 <strong>Stigmatika of White</strong> since it is a generic fusion spell that can also act as a <strong>Miracle Fusion</strong> for the <strong>Albaz</strong> fusions and it sets itself if it is discarded off of <strong>Albaz</strong>. 3 <strong>Nadir Servant</strong> for some <strong>Dogmatika</strong> plays. 3 <strong>Destruction Swordsman Fusion</strong>. 2 <b>Dogmatika Encounter </b>which recurs your <strong>Dogmatikas </strong>and <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>. 2 <strong>Stigmatika Scream</strong> which gets back any fusion which includes ur <strong>Buster Blader</strong> fusion. 3 <strong>Trap Trick</strong>. 3 <strong>Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman</strong> which is prime real-estate for your <strong>Buster Blader</strong> plays. 2<strong> Destruction Sword Memories</strong> which is sent off of <strong>Prologue</strong>. 2 <strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong> for some interruption.  Extra Deck is kind of tight. You need to run your <strong>Buster Blader</strong> cards and cards for <strong>Dogmatika</strong> and <strong>Stigmatika</strong> and you need to ensure it can handle the cost of <strong>Disparity</strong>. 2 <strong>Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman</strong>. 2 <strong>Albion the Stigmatika Dragon</strong>. 2<strong> Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</strong> (for<strong> Nadir Servant</strong> and<strong> Albion</strong>). 1 <strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>. 1 <strong>Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</strong>. 2 <strong>Buster Dragon</strong>. 1 <strong>Wind Pegasus @Ignister</strong> for it's grave eff. 1 of the <strong>BLS</strong> link. 1 <strong>Knightmare Unicorn</strong>. 1<strong> Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman</strong>. 1 <strong>Linkuriboh</strong>.  Side Deck has 3 <strong>Lancea</strong>, 3 <strong>Belle</strong>, 3 <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, 1 <strong>Called by the Grave</strong>, and 2 <strong>Judgment of Stigmatika</strong> which is just a specific board wipe. There are also more fusions that you can use in tandem with <strong>Fallen of Albaz</strong>.<strong> Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</strong>, <strong>Borreload Furious Dragon</strong>, and <strong>Brigand the Glory Dragon</strong> are all summonable off of <strong>Albaz</strong> and off of <strong>Albion</strong>. I only play <strong>Glory Dragon</strong> since it lists <strong>Albaz</strong> as material which means you can use <strong>Stigmatika of White</strong>'s<strong> Miracle Fusion</strong> eff and since its a more specific summoning requirement against decks whose monsters don't fit the bill for your other targets."

You can skip MP1 using Amorphactor pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord and with Terminal World both players skip MP2. The idea was inspired after duelling someone online using Thunder of Ruler to skip the battle phase. The ruling of yugioh is there can be no mp2 if there is no battle phase if you do wish to run a trap trick/thunder ruler to ensure it can't be quick play removed.  The x3 Preparation of rights lets you search Benten to search Vanities Ruler if you need another lockdown turn 1 or ritual summon multiple times.  Cyber angel Natasha is the perfect atk level to ritual summon after recovering the ritual spell then gain LP/protect rituals. Combo with Unicorn to lock extra deck monsters.. or ritual loop summon with Idaten (re-adding ritual spell with eff then tribute with draitron to gain the atk and resummon with the draitron u summoned) to give +1k atk permanently.  Disciple of the Nadir allows u to pop/search by sending from the extra deck to grab Dogmatika Albaz Knight from the deck OR GY! then u can discard for draitron effect after the search.  On the turn you don't use the Dogma engine you can xyz into Lyrilusc to attack directly then xyz AA-Zeus on MP2 to wipe the field.  This missing extra deck cards were 2 Fossil Machine Skill wagons for backrow removal."

Nothing to special, but a deck I hold dearly.","Its a pretty standard Windwitch Majespecter Deck with the new support for the Windwitch-Archetype from ""<em>Blazing Vortex""</em> (04.02.2021).  Main goal of this deck is to use your Windwitch engine to summon the <em>""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon""</em> or as a alternative (to have some fun) the new Boss of the Windwitches<em> ""Windwitch - Diamond Bell""</em>.  The Majespecters will mainly be used as fodder for your bigger summons or to tribute them for their own Spell and Trap Cards to gain some control over the board.  Tech Cards for this Deck are one copie of <em>""Servant of Endymion""</em> (since she is a Wind/Spellcaster which can be used as a normal scale for pendelum + free summon for a Bunbuku) and two <em>""Luster Pendelum, the Dracoslayer""</em> (for another pseudo boss<em> ""Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer""</em>).  <em>""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara""</em> is in this deck in case that you start with only one copy of<em> ""Windwitch - Snow Bell""</em> and <em>""Windwitch - Freeze Bell""</em>. <ol>  	<li>In this case you can normal summon your <em>""Windwitch - Snow Bell""</em>, after that activate the effect of <em>""Windwitch - Freeze Bell""</em> to special summon her from hand.</li>  	<li>Then you can raise the lvl of <em>""Windwitch - Freeze Bell""</em> from 3 to 4 to summon<em> ""Hi-Speedroid Chanbara""</em> (Lvl 5).</li>  	<li>Since he was summoned using this two special Windwitches, Chanbara cant be destroyed by battle or opponents card effects.</li> </ol> I know its not the best summon possible, but it is still a decent wall for a Fun/Casual Deck.  &nbsp;  I tried to fit in the <em>""Quintet Magician""</em> but I am not sure what to switch out for it."

Very frail deck but the payoff is huge.,"A very very frail deck.  Strategy is to summon <a data-name=""Cloudian - Turbulence"">Cloudian - Turbulence </a>and get at least 7 Fog Counters on it and then proceed to spew out link monsters until you have a good board. Your Frogs are a back-up plan or a combo extender to your Cloudians, being able to make <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> to disrupt your opponents next turn and gain advantage or using <a data-name=""Ronintoadin"">Ronintoadin</a> to add to your link plays.  With 7 Fog Counters you can make <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess + </a><a data-name=""Knightmare Gryphon"">Knightmare Gryphon (for the lockdown) </a>or <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess </a>+ <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>(for the 9500ish combined attack).  <a data-name=""Fog Control"">Main ways to get Fog Counters on Turbulence:</a>  Turbulence gains counters on Normal Summon equal to the amount of face-up Cloudians. So he always starts with 1. But with the use of <a data-name=""Water Hazard"">Water Hazard</a> to Special Summon a Cloudian from your hand first or just from having Cloudians left over from the previous turn, he can start with more Counters.  3/5/7 Counters) Normal Summon Turbulence + 1/2/3 Fog Control in hand (Activate Turbulence's effect first to summon a <a data-name=""Cloudian - Smoke Ball"">Cloudian - Smoke Ball</a> and then tribute that Smoke Ball and place the 3 counters on the Turbulence and repeat to the number of Fog Controls in your hand)  4 Counters) <a data-name=""Cloudian Aerosol"">Cloudian Aerosol</a> in hand +  Level 4 Cloudian Monster in  hand (Activate Aerosol and tribute a Cloudian in your hand and place the 4 Counters on Turbulence)  1 Counter) <a data-name=""Cloudian - Storm Dragon"">Cloudian - Storm Dragon</a> + 1 Cloudian in the GY (Banish 1 Cloudian (usually a level 4) from your GY to Special Summon Storm Dragon from hand. Once per turn, he allows you to place 1 Counter on Turbulence)  Just mess around with it and you'll soon get all the other combos for links and Counters and whatnot."

The deck is still just as good as ever, still as fun as ever too. This list is made from the TCG banlist and format, but contains cards for Lightning Overdrive, a set that has not yet even been out in the OCG yet if I'm not mistaken, so the deck is susceptible to change depending on what our next banlist looks like and how the meta shapes up. <h2>Ratio Explanation</h2> <h3>Main Deck:</h3> <h4>The Plunders:</h4> 3x whitebeard, its the best starter in the deck, it floats into another plunder.  3x redbeard, a great card to go into ships with, is vital to the halq combo  3x bluebeard, it's a decent extender and a name so your not locked out of it by your other plunders  3x goldenhair, it's both a starter and extender for the deck, it makes the toad line live among other various utilities.  3x ravenwing (new card), it's an extender that recycles a plunder, the only downside is it's the only extender that locks you into plunders by it's effect <h4>Other Starters/Extenders:</h4> 3x shthana, it's a free water, arguably better than silent angler as an extender <h4>Handtraps:</h4> 3x ash blossom, it's one of if not the most versatile handtrap right now  3x ghost belle, this is very effective against the current TCG meta, is subject to change based on how the format continues  1x effect veiler, is only here as a technicality, really you use it more for the halq combo as a level one tuner, but it could potentially come up at some point as a hantrap <h4>Spells/Traps:</h4> 3x emblem, it tags out a plunder into a ship, it's more useful on the draw than on the play  3x shipyarrrd, the field spell that searches your deck, do I really have to say more  1x shipshape ships shipping, you use this as discard fodder as well as being a good extender, I have hard made Lys with this about as many times as I've seen an aesthetically pleasing ojama card  2x salvage, this recycles plunders from grave for more fodder for your ships  1x terraforming, it's an extra copy of the field spell, it's at one, so you can only play one  3x dark ruler no more, it's a good call card against the current meta, it shuts down vanitys ruler in drytron, and can shut VW out of VFD if they don't shotgun it.  3x booty, this is not only a great extender, but also your crutch against unfavorable attribute matchups <h3>The Extra Deck:</h3> <h4>The Ships:</h4> 2x lys, it's the best ship, light is a common attribute and it negates monster effects  2x moerk, dark is another common attribute, and it banishes cards  2x brann, the worst ship, fire isn't common in most decks outside of ash since infernobles died, banishing backrow is alright against some decks <h4>The Best Card:</h4> 3x Blackbeard, it can tag out into ships while drawing a card, it's easy to go into,this card is instrumental to many of your plays <h4>The Halq Combo Cards:</h4> 1x halq, it's halq, it grabs a tuner from deck, need I say more  1x quandax, you tag into this with halq's second effect, and use it for synchro plays on your opponent's turn  1x quariongandrax, this is what you make with quanax, it can banish two cards <h4>The Toad Combo Cards:</h4> 1x bahamut shark, this shit out a toad  1x toad, it's the boy, an omni negate <h3>The Others:</h3> 1x almiraj, you use this if you open nothing else in your hand but one goldenhair, then you can make blackbeard with this card at least. <h2>Combos</h2> <h3>The Halq Combo (Whitebeard + Extender):</h3> <ol>  	<li>Summon Whitebeard and extender</li>  	<li>Make Halq</li>  	<li>Cl1 whitebeard to summon redbeard</li>  	<li>Cl2 halq to get veiler</li>  	<li>Opponent's turn tag out halq for quandax</li>  	<li>Cl1 redbeard tag out into a ship</li>  	<li>Cl2 quandax to synchro summon quariongandrax</li>  	<li>quariongandrax to banish up to three cards</li>  	<li>redbeard effect to equip to a ship</li> </ol> <h3>The Toad Combo (Goldenhair + Extender):</h3> <ol>  	<li>summon goldenhair and extender</li>  	<li>overlay into bahamut shark</li>  	<li>bahamut shark to bring out toad detaching goldenhair</li>  	<li>goldenhair effect in grave to revive itself</li>  	<li>link goldenhair and bahamut shark into blackbeard</li>  	<li>opponent's turn tag blackbeard out for a ship</li> </ol> <h2>Potential Techs:</h2> <h3>Gozer:</h3> It is good disruption for fiend decks, as well as being easy to summon <h3>Dragite:</h3> Another good disruption card for the deck <h3>Go Second Toolbox:</h3> This deck can OTK very easily, but in this format, attempting to blind second with a deck that isn't dinos is a death wish. <h2>Closing Thoughts:</h2> This is a very versatile and fun deck, I love how it plays so much on your opponent's turn, it's never really a dull game with this deck, except when you are starring down a VFD or Vanities Ruler and can't play the game."

They were a pretty fine deck, could get out a Towers and a Darkfluid with some monster negates, but that's really it. <em>However</em>, with the newest support including <strong>Dark Infant @Ignister</strong>, <strong>Danmari @Ignister</strong>, as well as <strong>When A.I. First Met You</strong>, this deck has become truly an explosive force to be reckoned with. Using only a single card, this deck can set up a 4K Arrival with a Danmari in the GY to serve as a negate, and that's not even counting the other cards in hand! When going first, the goal is to end on this Arrival with Danmari in grave, as well as a Cyberse Magician and Cyberse Quantum Dragon on field to serve as a pseudo targeting effect/battle phase lock. Going second, this deck has many options, but my favorite is a fun little Fire Phoenix @Ignister OTK thanks to Misplaymaker on the Ignister Deck Discord.  &nbsp;  So first, let's start with the one card OTK combo because it's the easiest to go through. This can be done with either Pikari or Achichi in the opening hand, I'll use Pikari as an example. <ol>  	<li>Normal Pikari, add When A.I. First Met You</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant, add A.I. Land to hand</li>  	<li>Activate A.I. Land</li>  	<li>Activate When A.I. First Met You, searching Achichi by revealing Fire Phoenix</li>  	<li>Special summon Achichi, add Bururu</li>  	<li>Link summon Splash Mage</li>  	<li>Special summon Bururu, send Donyoribo from deck to grave</li>  	<li>Activate Splash Mage's effect to special summon Pikari from grave</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Wind Pegasus using Pikari and Bururu</li>  	<li>Special summon Pikari back with Bururu's effect</li>  	<li>Activate Pikari's effect to make Wind Pegasus level 4</li>  	<li>Overlay Pikari and Wind Pegasus for Mathmech Alembertian</li>  	<li>Detach 2 materials to add Mathmech Multiplication from deck to hand</li>  	<li>Tribute Alembertian using its effect to special summon Multiplication</li>  	<li>Link summon Fire Phoenix using Splash Mage and Multiplication</li>  	<li>Double Fire Phoenix's attack using Multiplication's effect</li>  	<li>Attack using Fire Phoenix, activating its effect to deal effect damage equal to its attack</li>  	<li>Chain Donyoribo's effect in GY to double the effect damage from Fire Phoenix, dealing 9200 directly for game</li> </ol> &nbsp;  Now, that combo is for going second. For going first, the start is essentially the same. The hands can get a bit tricky to navigate to reach an Arrival end-board, so I won't give an example of that loooooong combo line for Quantum Dragon and Cyberse Magician, but I will do a basic 1-card line for Arrival with Danmari. <ol>  	<li>Normal Achichi, add Pikari</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant, add A.I. Land to hand</li>  	<li>Activate A.I. Land</li>  	<li>Special summon Pikari, add When A.I. First Met You</li>  	<li>Link summon Cyberse Wicckid</li>  	<li>Activate When A.I. First Met You, searching Doyon by revealing Dark Templar</li>  	<li>Special summon Doyon, add Achichi from GY to hand</li>  	<li>Activate Cyberse Wicckid's effect, banishing Dark Infant to add Bururu from deck to hand</li>  	<li>Link summon Splash Mage using Doyon and Wicckid</li>  	<li>Activate Doyon's effect to add When A.I. First Met You back to hand from the GY</li>  	<li>Special summon Bururu, send Danmari from deck to grave</li>  	<li>Activate Splash Mage's effect to special summon Doyon from grave</li>  	<li>Use all 3 monsters to link summon Dark Templar</li>  	<li>Special summon Achichi to a zone Dark Templar points to</li>  	<li>Activate Dark Templar's effect, special summoning back Bururu and Pikari</li>  	<li>Synchro summon Wind Pegasus using Pikari and Bururu</li>  	<li>Special summon Pikari back with Bururu's effect</li>  	<li>Use all 4 monsters to link summon The Arrival. This leaves you on a 4K towers, Danmari in grave, and Wind Pegasus in grave for further interruption</li> </ol> Of course this is done with 1 card, from here you can use your remaining cards to continue setting up or hold them for later. Ideally, you will also have a Cyberse Quantum Dragon and Cyberse Magician on field as well, but it tends to take a total of 2-3 cards in total for the full combo and not just 1. Additionally, Formud Skipper is a fun starter for quickly getting to your ritual monsters if you already start with Achichi or Pikari in hand. <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Formud Skipper</li>  	<li>Activate Skipper's effect and reveal The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister to change its name</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant using Skipper, searching A.I. Land and chaining Skipper to search either Water Leviathan or Cyberse Magician</li>  	<li>Do the rest of the combo normally but go into Cyberse Witch partway through, special summoning a monster to its zone to banish a spell and add the other rital monster + Cynet Ritual</li> </ol> &nbsp;  But yeah, those are some of the new fun thing @Ignisters can do! Obviously this deck is made with going both first and second in mind, but in games 2 and 3 you can side out cards from either half of the deck based on if you are going first or second. Hope this is helpful to all of you aspiring Ignister players!

I wouldn't call it anything too special or crazy. optimally I ","Ok, so this deck is something I have been working on since 2016- I don't know how good it is nor do I care to get too competitive cause I don't like how I get when I get competitive. But I figured I would upload an optimal list based on the December 15th ban-list. I know Dragoon is not well liked the way it is used- but to be fair it isn't even the focus on my deck it's just a neat add- on to me as I haven't even used it or experienced it used against me yet. This is the first time I am uploading a deck profile here, please don't be too harsh- I understand if you would criticize the deck build for not being meta relevant enough; I'm just lookin to improve my deck building strategies. The goal of this deck as I stated in the summary is essentially ending on a board with primarily Dragon knight, and whatever I can use to sway the battle in my favor. Nothing too degenerate, unless you adamantly hate dragoon- which I subbed paladin out for. I generally put myself up to a challenge of using fusion, synchro, xyz, pendulum, link, and ritual in a deck to get better at those SS. I doubt that it would even handle a YCS, but this deck is special to me- it has seen me through many a tough stressful duel with friends and relatives whom played the game. I must also add it has seen countless revisions and variations. I meant to include rod and maybe robe but again the focus isn't too heavily on just Dark Magician but protecting the field with dragons, warriors and spellcasters . Initially I wanted to use citadel of endymion for spell-counter control but when I saw how easily my board was picked apart by a duelist whom I was a rival of well into the first couple of iterations I decided to eventually cut it for iris. a lot of the inspiration for this deck came from duels with friends and the combinations of the cards they used. I built this deck through trial and error as well as the sequence of cards I obtained- initially it was all spellcasters and roughly thrown together in it's prototype configuration. after many losses in 2016 I spent countless hours studying the rulebook, tips, and card strategy which ultimately would take four years of time. I have yet to even Extra Link yet, or even figure out how to incorporate Links into my strategy properly. I've made 60 card, 50 card, and 40 card variants but I excelled with 50-60 card variants. I would like to eventually get it to a 40 card variant which would more efficiently and consistently hone my strategy. I absolutely dislike Pot of Desires, Extravagance would be more tolerable. That said thank you for reading patiently. I appreciate your feedback"

This can either be on your side of the field or on you opponents. All magical musketeers have the same effect: All magical muskets (spell and trap cards) can be activated from the hand during either players turn.</p> <p>A quick overview of magical musketeers &amp; effects used in the deck:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Starfire: (monster searcher/special summon) You can special summon 1 magical musketeer in DEF position.</li>  	<li>Casper: (searcher) You can add 1 magical musket card from deck to your hand (except the one that triggered the effect)</li>  	<li>Kidbrave: (draw power) You can discard 1 magical musket card and draw 2 cards.</li>  	<li>Doc: (Recycle 1) You can add 1 magical musket card form you GY to your hand (except the on that triggered the effect)</li>  	<li>Wild: (Recycle 2+ draw) You can target 3 musket cards in you GY, shuffle them in the deck then draw 1 card.</li>  	<li>Calamity: (monster reborn) You can special summon 1 magical musketeer and special summon it in DEF position.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The magical muskets (spell and trap cards) can only be activated when a magical musketeer is on the field. Note that as mentioned earlier, when a magical musketeer is on the field these can be activated from hand. All magical muskets can only be activated once per turn</p> <p>A quick overview of Magical muskets used in the deck:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Cross-domination: Target 1 face up monster; negate its effect &amp; change ATK &amp; DEF to 0 until the rest of the turn.</li>  	<li>Last stand: When your opponent activates a spell/Trap card, negate the activation and destroy that card.</li>  	<li>Dancing needle: Target up to 3 cards in GY's banish them.</li>  	<li>Desperado: Target 1 face up card on the field, destroy it.</li>  	<li>Crooked crown: During the MP special summon 1 magical musketeer from hand and if the main monster zone of the column of the special summon monster is unused, your opponent can't used that for the rest of the turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>About the Eldlich archetype:</strong> <p>The eldich archetype has some similarities with the magical musket; Your trap cards only gain their <span>""</span>Golden<span>"" </span>effect when the golden lord is on the field.</p> <p>An overview of the eldlich cards used:</p> <p>Golden monsters &amp; trap monsters</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Eldlich the golden lord: Send this card &amp; 1 Spell/Trap from your hand to the GY, then target 1 card to pop. If this card is in the GY you can send 1 spell/trap card you control to the GY to add the golden lord back to your hand. Then you can specail summon a zombie monster<span><strong>*</strong></span> form you hand, it gains 1000 ATK/DEF and can't be destroyed by card effects until the and of the turn. You can only use each effect once per turn.</li>  	<li>Conquistador: When you activate is you can special summon this as a normal monster. ""Golden"" effect: Destroy 1 face-up card on the field. When this card is in your GY you can banish it to set 1 eldlixer from you deck. you can only use 1 effect per turn and only once per turn.</li>  	<li>Huaquero: When you activate is you can special summon this as a normal monster. ""Golden"" effect: Banish 1 card from either GY. When this card is in your GY you can banish it to set 1 eldlixer from you deck. you can only use 1 effect per turn and only once per turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The eldlixers:</p> <p>a good note to add here is that after an special summon is conducted with an eldlixer you are locked into special summoning zombies,  therefore you can not go into and extra deck non-zombie or trigger some of you magical musketeers effects.</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Black: Special summon 1 zombie monster from you hand or deck <span><strong>*</strong></span> in DEF position. You can banish this card form the GY set 1 ""golden land spell/trap directly from the deck to the GY. Only 1 effect of Black can be used per turn and once per turn.</li>  	<li>White: Special summon 1 zombie monster from you hand or GY <span><strong>*</strong></span>. During MP1 you can banish this card form the GY set 1 ""golden land spell/trap directly from the deck to the GY. Only 1 effect of White can be used per turn and once per turn.</li>  	<li>Sanguine: Special summon 1 zombie monster from you deck or GY<span><strong>*</strong></span>. You can banish this card form the GY set 1 ""golden land spell/trap directly from the deck to the GY.

You can only activate 1 ""golden land forever"" once per turn.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><span><span>*</span></span> note that the golden lord is the only zombie/Eldlich monster you play.</p> <strong>Other cards</strong>: <p>As suggested in the earlier comments on the deck profile some draw power goes a long way. I've added two cards to increase the decks draw power:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Pot of extravagance: At the start op MP1 banish 3 or 6 cards random facedown from you extra deck. Draw 1 card for every 3 cards banished. for the rest of this turn after this card resolves you cannot draw any card by card effects.</li>  	<li>Upstart goblin: Draw 1 card, then your opponent gains 1000 LP</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>Other cards:</strong> <p>In the side deck I've put cards that either are in the archetype and not used, or could make a great addition. (If you have any more suggestions, let me know!)</p> <p>Not used:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Cursed Eldand: Although, it is used in almost any eldlich deck, however here it has a big downside: You can't attack with zombie monsters which hurts your Liebe, Borrelsword and musketeers.</li>  	<li>Guardian: It is simply the weakest golden land card and there is no space. The only positive not here is that it doesn't target.</li>  	<li>Zakiel: Same as guardian, the weakest magical musketeer. And there is no space in the deck.</li>  	<li>Steady hands: one of the lack luster musket cards.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> Could come in handy, but... no room:</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Fiendish deal: Allows your musketeers to be protected from destruction with card effects.</li>  	<li>White elephant gift: Could bring extra draw power. When the goldenland trapmonsters are summoned they are normal monsters and could be scarified for a 2 card draw.</li>  	<li>Adelantado: Would be an ultimate board clear when thing go south.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <strong>The extra deck:</strong> <p>Neither Magical musket or Eldlich uses the extra deck with an exception of 3 cards. I will not go in depth on the effects except of the cards that are great for this deck (in my opinion)</p>  <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li>Magical musketeer Max: If this card is Link Summoned: You can activate 1 of these effects; <ul>  	<li>Add ""Magical Musket"" Spells/Traps with different names from your Deck to your hand, up to the number of monsters your opponent controls.</li>  	<li>Special Summon ""Magical Musket"" monsters with different names from your Deck, up to the number of Spells/Traps your opponent controls. You can only use this effect of ""Magical Musketeer Max"" once per turn. During either player's turn, you can activate ""Magical Musket"" Spell/Trap Cards from your hand.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>Gustav Max: once per turn: You can detach 1 material form this card: inflict 2000 DMG to your opponent.</li>  	<li>Juggernaut Liebe: Once per turn, you can also Xyz Summon Juggernaut Liebe by using 1 Rank 10 Machine Xyz Monster you control as material. (Transfer its materials to this card.) Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card; it gains 2000 ATK/DEF, also for the rest of this turn, you can only declare an attack with this card. During each Battle Phase, this card can make attacks on monsters up to the number of Xyz Materials it has +1.</li>  	<li>Knightmare package</li>  	<li>Borrelsword dragon</li>  	<li>Constellar Pleiades</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <b>The quantity's of each card:</b>  The 2 archetypes have both a similarity they absolutely NEED their monsters in order to result their disruptions. Therefor the deck maxes out on the best musketeers &amp; the golden lord. The other musketeers are at1 since they are better used in the grind game.  I've put all magical musket disruption at 2. In some match-ups you can change this depending on  the deck you're facing.  For the eldlixer I've put all of them at 2 these are needed to special summon the golden lord. Sanguine is at 3 because it is both GY &amp; Deck and it can be activated on you opponents turn, bypassing the zombie locking in your turn.  Conquistador is at 3 because it is better than Huaquero in my opinion (and Huaquero is outclassed with dancing needle). And Golden land forever is at 2 for a nice omni-negate.  For draw power: Pot is great, but can not trigger a musketeer the first turn. Upstart goblin can, which could result you in multiple draw/searches with the right musketeer.  In the extra deck I've put all the card I find crucial at 3. Because the probability of the banishing a crucial card is significantly decreased at 3:  website: https://www.dcode.fr/picking-probabilities:  when banishing 6 cards: <table>  <tr> <td>Nr. of cards</td> <td>chance of banishing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>47,5 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>29,6 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>4,4 %</td> </tr>  </table> When banishing 3 cards: <table>  <tr> <td>Nr. of cards</td> <td>chance of banishing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>43.5 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>7.9 %</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>0.2 %</td> </tr>  </table> <strong>Things to keep in mind:</strong> <ul>  	<li>You need your Musketeers and/or golden lord in order to make your disruptions go off.</li>  	<li>all eldlixers  lock you into only being able to special summon zombies.</li>  	<li>Make sure you place your cards in the correct columns</li> </ul> I hope you liked this deck profile and if you have any remarks/tips let me know!"

This is great by itself but the rose dragons make dragon link even better than it already is! Now the end board (1.5 cards) is VFD, Apollusa (2 negates), an extra savage and (if you have ANY additional extender) a Dragoon as well! This is really big since it is 2 extra OMNI negates. This is fairly easy to pull off and the deck is full of extenders. For the new rose dragon cards I am using Rocss Rose dragon (is a starter, combo piece and TUNER) and Petal rose shoot (monster reborn for rose dragons and can be searched off of rocss rose). I am not running the new garden rose flower or the garden rose maiden because with the death of linkross, it is not possible to play those in dragon link, sorry! Also I decided to make this a 60 card deck to avoid drawing bricks and so that I could run dragoon. The deck is still consistent, it now has 12 starters (3 of each rocss rose, sefert, chaos space and black metal) so you should see 1 every 5 cards which is perfect if you ask me. Same goes for the extenders, you should see them also very often. For bricks you have - dragondark (Omg you never want to draw this), Driver, Red-eyes Black Dragon, Red-eyes Fusion and Dark Magician. The soft bricks include Boot sector launch and Dragonhawk since you are going to search them anyway and drawing into them simply means you need to use it from the hand. Red rose is not a brick, I made a separate combo for it in my video (you don’t summon it from the hand off of halq) and it proves red-rose isn’t a brick. Dragonroar is not a brick in most cases since you can use sefert/white dragon/black dragon/chaos space to combo with it and you can banish tempest instead with Trish (tempest search draco). Tempest can be milled off of ravine if you draw absorouter or tracer. Also some cards in this build you may think are bricks are actually not, like White rose (can special itself if you have tracer, red rose or rocss rose and can be special summoned off of red rose if you already have the rocss rose on the field), Tempest (can simply discard it and it can come back from the grave), Crusadia Draco (can special itself from hand), Petal rose shoot (can summon a rose dragon from the grave - halq always summons a rose dragon so it will not brick since a rose will always be in the grave). </span>  &nbsp;  <b>Other notes</b><span>: I am also running the versatile handtraps for countering the current format (Jan 2021), if you are viewing this sometime later where it is a different format you can change up the handtrap lineup. I also use 2 petal rose shoots, not one since Rocss rose is not only a starter but also a very key combo piece! You need the 2 petal rose shoots to secure that you have at least 1 of it in deck. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Again, all the </span><b>combos</b><span>, explanations and everything are in my youtube video, Subscribing to the channel would be a great way to support me and also notifies you every time I upload!
