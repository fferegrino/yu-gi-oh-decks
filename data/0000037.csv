The control effect comes in because of the knightmare part of the extra deck. Have Fun,"Today in the Meta Game there are decks that can make unbreakable boards, one of the only ways to overcome this obstacle is massive damage that can break those boards. The way that Crusadias do this is with the effect of other booster cards such as Leonis, Maximus and Revival. To cater to the players who enjoy obsessively stopping the opponent's plays entirely using the knightmare engine. This makes the deck extremely potent going first or second."

This deck can do everything a normal sky striker deck can do, except go crazy on card advantage(as no engage is present) and without stealing your opponent's Lady Debug.  And as such, this deck simply can't do a lot much with decks that go crazy on card advantage or with a great recovery.  &nbsp;  I'll explain how without engage you can try to win your matchups and the general strategy of the deck.  First of: you have 8 of the best starters, which are: Raye, Hornet, ROTA and Formud Skipper. And you have 5 of the soft searchers, which will be a bit of RNG to get a Raye or Hornet from it, but some times it will work, and this is: Area Zero and Terraforming. Then you have Card Destruction and Reasoning, Card destruction after activated, you have around 70% chance of getting one of the 8starters and 50% chance of getting the the soft searchers. Reasoning is a lot of RNG, but in genereal most of the times people will declare 4 and your raye will be sent to the grave, that's not that bad, as the main reason reasoning is played here is, aside for dumping your grave with spells, you can get Raye(if they don't declare 4 and you excavate it) or get you Formud on field; if you get Veiler, if you have the field with you, target it and try to send to grave, if you don't, just link summon linkuriboh to free your main zone. And then you have other combos, like Field+TwinTwisters/JammingWaves/Multiroll. Also there's Foolish goods, if your hand don't have literally anything you can use to start your play, don't be afraid to dump metalfoes fusion, maybe that one draw might be your last one, or it may be a Raye.  Also, when the card Cynet Mining gets released on the TCG, your chance of opening one of the best starters goes to 82%, and this is more than the rate of opening Engage/Raye/Rota/Hornet on the actual Sky Striker deck.(If you, a pro Sky Striker player out there is reading this, think about Formud Skipper and Cynet Mining and see how it can increase the consistency of the deck :v)  Now for the Matchups:  Lair of Darkness AKA shit virus deck: you lose, unless they brick so so so so so hard.  Thunder Dragon: Haven't played much against them, you can't compete with their card advantage, tre best you can do is have your Shizuku and use Eagle Booster on her and try to survive each turn this way. Or you can side the Toon Cyber Chimeratech engine to at least get rid of the Titan they leave on the Extra Zone. Locking their of they grave with maybe Necrovalley could help, but then you're also locking yourself as well, so it's a mixed. Also I've sided 3 Eater of Millions just for problematic shit like Colossus, since you're just using 10 of the Sky Strikers link(triple Kagari, Hayate, Shizuku and 1 Kaina) you can just banish your other 5 to get rid of Colossus)  Altergeist: Playable and actually solely dependant on player's skills, Twin twisters, jamming waves, eaglebooster your stuff.  Salamangreat: If you go first, abosutely try to dump your Shark Cannon and set it, just banish Spinny if they try to summon that, or after they use Gazelle banish it so they won't recur it, tought banishing spiinny is preferable. Twin twisting their field also is great, as they can't do the better plays without it and they only run 1 of it mostly. Veilering Debug also completely stops their entire combo, unless they have spinny on hand, also the Skull meister is a great side deck against Salads. If you go second, bait that roar, just bait that roar and you're absolutely fine, if they rage you, Raye simply use her quick effect or if they rage a link, just get back Raye. Also the Segmental Dragon is great against this matchup as well, just grab yourself some spells in grave, summon shizuku to lower their attack and use his effect to destroy everything(try to banish Baillynx or force it) Skull Meister is also a good side against this deck.  Pendulum: Requires skill, but it's actually fairly fair.  Azathot turbo: Just Eagle boost Redoer and you're fine lol(I actually came up with this play way way before it got used in the YCS, but whatever) Skull Mesiter is great against this one because the Orcusts banish themselves for cost.  True Sky Strikers: you won't compete against their card advantage, Engage and Widow Anchor. There's nothing worse than facing a complete Sky Striker deck using this one. Unless the player piloting the other is really bad. Since you have yourself a Kagari and you know that there's going to be people playing Strikes on your OTS, or something, just grab yourself 3 GHost Reapers and then use on Kagari, their game is over.  And that's about it. I hope Engage and Widow drops in place so I can play the deck normally :v"

I've watched countless deck profiles and have perfected my playstyle with this deck for literally years as of now, and I'm convinced that this version of the deck is one of the most efficient ones to date. It's been somewhat inspired by DDD Dave's list, although he goes for a more control-heavy version of the deck that ends up feeling almost anti-meta, which isn't what I was going for with this list. <a data-name=""D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh"">D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh</a> is a much needed breath of fresh air for the archetype, as it helps the deck consolidating the pendulum based playstyle this deck has been relying on ever since links were introduced. This isn't exactly a beginner friendly list, and I wouldn't recomend it to someone who's never played the deck before, but it's a very solid and consistent version of the deck that includes only on the D/D/D archetype without sacrificing its viability.  There's a few choices that may look weird or subpar at first, and I'd like to go over them: <ul>  	<li>I play 3 <a data-name=""D/D Necro Slime"">D/D Necro Slime</a> instead of <a data-name=""D/D Vice Typhon"">D/D Vice Typhon</a> because it's overall less of a dead card, as it can be normal summoned if needed and it can lead into a <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a></li>  	<li>I chose to maindeck <a data-name=""Shared Ride"">Shared Ride</a> specifically for the Sky Striker matchup, which is arguably the hardest one for this deck</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Wavering Eyes "">Wavering Eyes</a> is a generally pretty good card to extend your plays once you're done with Gilgamesh, as it can get you a free <a data-name=""D/D Savant Kepler"">D/D Savant Kepler</a>, which potentially means having access to any monster in the deck (<a data-name=""because of Dark Contract with the Gate"">because of Dark Contract with the Gate</a>)</li>  	<li>This deck initially played 3 copies of <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike,</a> which I replaced with 3 copies of <a data-name=""Ultimate Providence"">Ultimate Providence</a> as it's an overall more versatile card that also helps with setting up your graveyard</li> </ul> Lastly, the entirety of the side deck should mostly be self explanatory, but if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to dm me, I'll gladly change the list if so required~"

According to German folklore, the term ""Freischütz"" refers to a marksman who made a contract with the devil to obtain seven magic bullets with supernatural accuracy. The first six bullets are subservient to the wielder's control, while the seventh will be in the devil's grip completely.  All members of this archetype are based on seven characters from the opera, in addition to sporting names and physical appearances to notable figures of American Western history and lore. Visually, all of them share three design aspects: a demonic-styled weapon, a clawed blue arm holding the weapon, and one or more large, red wings with blue eyes near the joint.  <hr />  <h1>What Does the Deck Do?</h1> This archetype revolves around using their monsters to accumulate their Spells/Traps in order to disrupt almost any moves their opponents may be attempting. All of their monsters can activate their effects when a Spell/Trap is activated in the same column as theirs (including opponent's). In addition, they also allows player to activate ""Magical Musket"" Spell/Traps from their hand, essentially turning them into hand traps, making their moves harder to predict and protect against.  Their monsters all have different effects, ranging from searching (""Caspar""), recycling (""Wild"" and ""Doc""), advantage generators (""Kidbrave"" and ""Zakiel""), and even swarming (""Starfire"" and ""Calamity""). Therefore, it is important to get those monsters onto the field as fast as possible. Since they're all LIGHT Fiends, they can utilize ""Ties of the Brethren"" as their main card to swarm the field, most of the time to bring out ""Caspar"", ""Doc"", and ""Kidbrave"" for maximum benefits.  <hr />  <h1>Major Weakness/Downfalls</h1> While powerful and consistent with their plethora of monster effects to generate advantage, it is also their greatest weakness. All ""Magical Musket"" Spells/Traps can only be activated while the player controls a ""Magical Musket"" monster, limiting their utility. Furthermore, they almost have no means of Special Summoning outside of their own theme (that doesn't rely on monster presence on the field), so any Summon negation cards such as ""Forced Back"", ""Solemn Warning"", ""Chaos Trap Hole"", and ""Horn of Heaven"" can help slow them down. Because of this Normal Summon dependence, this deck's particularly vulnerable when going second.  Hand traps are also effective against this deck, particularly ""Effect Veiler"", ""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"", ""Herald of Orange Light"", or ""PSY-Framegear Gamma"", since they can negate ""Magical Musket"" monster effects while also being out of reach from negation effect of ""Cross-Domination"". Mass-removal cards that can avoid ""Last Stand"" or ""Fiendish Deal"" are also effective to clear their entire field in one fell swoop, preventing them from activating more ""Magical Musket"" cards for the rest of that turn."

Also good free lv 1 to round up some lvs</li>  	<li>Helper:  First effect is only effective with big boards, second effect can throw off opponents boards heavily (like with ogre shutendoji)</li>  	<li>Soulclaw: Another special summon to round up levels, makes steam train king a lot easier because his level is awkward for the archetype</li>  	<li>Soulpeacemaker: Can correct a lot and provide GY setup or searches with e.g. Soulpiercer</li>  	<li>Steam Train King: The destroy effect is just a worse twin twister but can b deadly if you have the right cards in your hand, second effect basically destroys half of most deck's GY setups</li>  	<li>Warlord Susanowo: Good to summon if your opponent has staples in his GY like twin twister or idk mirror force if youre playing casually</li>  	<li>Beast Kyubi: Gets to 5k in no time and it isnt unusual that it reaches 7k, good OTK tool</li>  	<li>Sarutobi: Good monster to close turn with, quick effect is awkward for the opponent</li>  	<li>Stealth Ninja: Its just too beefy to not destroy it with card effects, so it will sometimes stay the whole game</li>  	<li>Ogre shutendoji: Just a feather duster... I mean do I have to say more? Just good, go into higher synchros though, because he will get demolished next turn</li> </ul> <strong>In conclusion:</strong>  OTKs very consistantly, but struggles a lot in link format. Tranporter and Helper are just useless and it hits the deck harder than it really should. The new coming support is neat, so I would look out for that if you wanna build a deck.  &nbsp;  I hope you have fun :)"

I've been tweaking this build for some time, and after having a few successful runs with it against other 'fun' decks, I thought I'd post it for people to enjoy.  I love cards like Nimble Angler for this deck, as you can plus from twin twisters which keeps you a board presence, and in some situations can get you a link monster on the field after clearing back row, which is always a good thing ;)  &nbsp;  Feel free to tweak this as you see fit, I love sharks IRL and was so hyped when they became something fun. Great white is the best card ever made.  &nbsp;  For anyone wondering about any combos for this deck, my favourite opener that I started with on my last run before uploading was:  Twin Twisters + Nimble Angler + Rescue Rabbit  + XYZ Remora. Twin twisters into the nimble angler (going second ofc) to then drop out 2 mantas and link off into Mermail Abyssalacia. Rescue Rabbit into GODMODE (Great white) to then make the Gem knight Pearl, then use XYZ Remora to make Pearl not consume pointless materials and make Shark Drake. Fifth card in said starting hand was called by the grave..shenanigans."

Well I saw the playstyle of those Orcust decks with PK Rusty in them, and I decided to use it for Dark Simorgh instead since I don't really understand how Orcust works. And maybe it'll turn out well, especially if you can get Dark Simorgh at first turn.  Probably this deck will still work even you can't activate bird's effect if it's summoned by Summon Sorceress and a Blackwing, but you can use it to make Rusty, dump Boots and got 2 Fog Blades. if you happen to have a wind and dark monster in your hand, you can summon it from graveyard. Anti-spell + Dark Simorgh might work as well."

After a lot of playtesting, this is what I would be playing for Pure Thunder Dragons to top at an event like a regional or YCS after the most recent January 2019 Banlist. This is a spicy build that I have come up with from scratch like most of my other builds I come up with for you guys. First off, after testing this deck has a pretty low brick rate and most of the time going first, you will be able to end on two <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> and a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a> with one or two pops from Titan, or triple Colossus and you may also be able to end on a <a data-name=""Number 22: Zombiestein"">Number 22: Zombiestein</a> as well. The main combo to end up with this board is a two card combo using <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonhawk"">Thunder Dragonhawk</a> and <a data-name=""Batteryman Solar"">Batteryman Solar</a>. You normal summon Solar to use its effect to send <a data-name=""Thunder Dragonroar"">Thunder Dragonroar</a><a data-name=""Thunder Dragonroar""> from your deck to graveyard</a> and then use Hawk's effect in hand to special summon Roar from grave. Then go into <a data-name=""Some Summer Summoner"">Some Summer Summoner</a> and use Roar's effect to special summon <a data-name=""Thunder Dragondark"">Thunder Dragondark</a> from the deck and use those three monsters to go into triple Colossus. Two of my spicy cards in the deck are the <a data-name=""Lightpulsar Dragon"">Lightpulsar Dragon</a> and the <a data-name=""Darkflare Dragon"">Darkflare Dragon</a>. These cards interact really well with the Thunder Dragons because you can banish them to summon these dragons and use the Thunder Dragon monster's effects since they activate when they are banished. Also Lightpulsar is nice because it can be summoned from not only the hand but the graveyard as well by sending a Light and Dark type monsters from your hand to grave. While making the deck I also realized wait, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon</a> can be searched off <a data-name=""Melody of The Awakening Dragon"">Melody of The Awakening Dragon</a>. So I added that in because it can come up sometimes as well as with the new link two, <a data-name=""Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon"">Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon</a> from Soul Fusion.

Go Check Out His 'Competitive Chain Burn Deck July 2018'  ,"Lazion, The Timelord; Lazion can inflict 1000 LP of damage if your opponent draws a card, really useful for LP burning. I would advise you to combo this w/ Absolute King Back Jack to excavate 1 card from the deck and hope for a LP burning trap such as ""Just Desserts"" or ""Secret Barrel"". Absolute King Back Jack is also useful for knowing which 3 cards at the top of the deck you're going to draw.  Marshmallon; Marshmallon can burn your opponent's LP easy.  Ojama Trio; Activate Ojama Trio to also activate ""Just Desserts"". That's an easy 1500 LP + 300 due to Ojama Trio's effect."

So this was a deck I made way WAY back when. I made it for two reasons, one, I bought the Legendary Dragons box and already had all the foiled versions of the Legendary Knights, before they got stolen, and because I was in a Yu-Gi-Oh roleplay Discord Server, and I used it as a deck for my character. The reason why it's bad? Because I was about 15 at the time, and I was still new to Yu-Gi-Oh. I did, however, saw something I could potentially abuse. The fusion, Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroying Swordsman, gains 1000 attack and defense for each Dragon on your opponent's field and GY, but can't attack directly. I then remember I had a copy of Magnum Sheild and United we stand, and, the deck included Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword, which equips to a monster and gives it 1000 attack, alongside 500 attack and defense for each dragon on any field and GY. So I got to wondering, what if I got Buster Blader equipped with these cards. Loe and behold, I made a glass cannon. It was clunky and bad, with horrible searching and just mediocre attacks. It was just all around a bad deck. But it was still fun to play."

In case you didn't know, it has an especially great matchup versus Salamangreat if you are able to open with Zombie World, since they require Cyberse monster for their usual Link combo (Beylinx requires Cybers, which is often they first go to Link Monster for combo).  Esala Wathuthantrige managed to pilot the deck to the Top 16 of last weeks Ultimate Duel Series (UDS) in Las Vegas, Nevada.  <strong>My </strong><b>opinion</b>  Here we got a deck which makes me wonder how I should feel about it. The basic idea of running a Orcust Danger Deck with Zombies instead of the usual Dark Warrior enginge surely sounds like a whole lot of funl. On the the other hand I'm not sure if the execution couldn't have been better. I'm deffinetely gonna have to give it a try, change some things and maybe share my thought on that with you on my channel (in German, in case you do not know me ^^)"

The card ""Hooked Shinin' Syncher"" has tons of potential. It combos very well with ""Salvage"". It is essentially a free 5 star tuner monster on the field. It can also be special summoned using Neptabyss and Dragoons.

Allows for a higher array of plays than your typical hand traps degenerate ""m","The main purpose of this deck is autonomy. This is not a deck full of degenerate hand traps (You can add them if you wish to make this more ""competitive"" if you please). This deck is less about stopping your opponent from playing and more about allowing you to consistently make plays.  Fear not fellow Thunder Dragon (TD) users. Even though gold sarcophagus has been limited, we can still abuse the banishment effect of our TDs. This next part will be me explaining the unconventional cards within my build.  Chaos Dragon Levianeer - This is simply a good card. It's destroy effect doesn't target, It is a 3000 attack monster, and it is not hard to summon.  Denko Sekka - This doesn't need much explanation as I have seen other users use Denko in their deck. I honestly feel that it is a stable to have especially when making first turn boards.  Necroface - This is such an underrated card. It was even stronger when gold sarcophagus was at 3. When combined with Allure of darkness, this can give you huge dividents while making your opponent cut out part of their deck. Lastly, if your somehow banishes all of your essential cards, necroface can retrieve them while also gainning attack.  D.D. Sprite / Instant fusion - I put these together because of the potential combo they can complete in tandum. However, they are both still very useful separately. D.D. Sprite can be used to reactivate the effects of thunder dragons that haven't been utilized. Instant fusion can summon Milliennium/Thousand-Eyes restrict that can get rid of a monster from your opponent. It also can be used to summon Invoked Raidjin. Raidjin can then flip itself upside-down and survive instant fusion's effect. When combined, any monster summoned with instant fusion can survive after the turn if D.D. Sprite's effect is used on it.  Selective Reborn - Can be used to banish thunder dragons to utilize their effects while also special summoning one from the graveyard.  Celestial Sextant - This is more of an experimental card. One issue with thunder dragons occurs when you have cards like beastial or avian without anyway of using them. This card is simply more draw power.  Super Polymerization - Combined with Aleister, this can allow for some sneaky plays. I see invokes as the new Shaddolls. No reason not to use Super Poly.  Pot of Acquisitiveness - This is another experimental card. This is a bit of a ""win-harder"" card, but I find it useful."

But, I didn't know what to make. I could go for Nekroz, but then again I wanted to use Shinobirds as well. Or even use some generic Ritual monsters as well to make a beat down deck. Then I remembered, Impcantations can ritual summon ANY ritual monster, as long as you use their respective spell card. So, with some testing and building, I came up with this, the Shinobird control deck! So, I'll show you what I mean. The Shinobird boss monsters both can return any card to the hand, with the only weakness being cards that resist any other card effects. With up to three non-targeting/destruction, it will almost always go off. So this deck is clearly a go second deck. Of course, you don't have to. What you could do is summon <a data-name=""Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord"">Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord</a> first, which stops most of your opponent's monsters. (Only cards being Rituals and Links) You can use <a data-name=""Amano-Iwato"">Amano-Iwato</a> as a Soul Drain with legs, and it doesn't stop Amorphactor Pain as well since it is an effect that doesn't activate. Use Shinobarron and Shinobarroness to get rid of problem cards, and use Impcantation cards to recycle them. If things don't work out, you have two different options. One, use the Mega Monarch to banish itself and send 8 monsters from your extra deck to the grave. Herald of the Light Arc and Elder Entity N'tss to get rid of three cards on your opponent's field, and add three ritual monsters or cards to your hand, then you can send 8 cards from your opponent's extra deck as well! Second, which is most destructive, is using <a data-name=""Amaterasu"">Amaterasu</a>, which can only be set. After being flipped up, it banishes every card on the field with no target. Once again, a powerful card. You shouldn't have that many cards on the field if your getting kinda beat. Use <a data-name=""Aratama"">Aratama</a> to find it. Overall, this deck is fun to mess around and to make shenanigans with. Try it out at your locals today!"

Dark World! But do you know about the duel terminal deck Fabled? Well, I do, and I love it. <a data-name=""Fabled Leviathan"">Fabled Leviathan</a> is best waifu. It works like Dark World, with having advantages of discard, but runs on the spam synchro format. Unfortunately, you can minus real hard so, be careful. You can find yourself empty handed quite quick and with a bad defense if you don't play it right. Of course, when you do play it right, it normally ends up with an OTK. I play a Synchro heavy variant, and there is also a link heavy variant. You can, however, play a combo of both, which is shown today. This deck ultimately works like Danger Dark World, but with more synchro monsters and link monster. So instead, I'll give some tips on how to use this deck. 1: Don't get rid of Fabled Grimo or Krus. These two cards are good for extending plays. Grimo can discard itself to add any Fabled monster to your hand, while Krus can revive a level 4 or lower Fabled in your GY. It's hard to do anything if you have these in your hand first turn, but later on, it helps a lot.  2: Fabled Dianaira, use him. Despite it being a very simple effect, it is very useful. It stops your opponent's first normal spell card, which can go a long way. And don't worry about the tribute cost, I mean. If you can't tribute summon this monster, then, you might as well not play this game anymore.  3: Improve on this deck This deck is just a skeleton. It's meant to get an understanding on to how the deck should work, and it is not a final. Make it your own way, make it some, Quasar spam build or even a Fabled Dark World build! The possibilities are endless."

However you want to play, I hope this deck helps you. There are many cards in this deck that you MUST have. XX-Saber Faultoll can summon from the grave over and over, Boggart Knight can summon another X-Saber from your hand, then you can summon Faultoll, Emmersblade to float into Darksoul to search or Ragigura to grab an X-Saber from the GY.
