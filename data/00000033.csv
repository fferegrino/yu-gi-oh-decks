Five months ago Deer Note wasn't even in Master Duel and Dante was in everyones ED to unbrick bad hands with Uni and E-Tele. Now? Zombies can mill a sixty card deck without grass, spam every lvl 8 and 10 synchro possible, they can scythe lock, have a floodgate field spell that can burden the best deck in the meta, and stops the second best deck, Floowandereeze, altogether. All this while no longer getting locked into zombies. Honestly this deck has become comparable to Adamancipators. Where Adamancipators still has less potential to brick an opening, the end board zombies can make deprecates on Adamacipators as a deck that utilizes a monster type rather than an archetype. You can do anything. Rarely have I not had all three mezuki in grave along with changshi, Chaos Ruler and Doomking. Put whatever you want in the Extra Deck, it doesn't matter, if it is generic and good (or not), zombies will make it. Accesscode, Apollousa, Underworld Goddess, Dweller, Bagooska, Baronne, Chengying, Elf; people are doing Stardust Dragon lines because they can. I know Tearlaments ARE the format, but I would still give zombies a try because they have never been so powerful.</p><p>With all that said, this is my deck! It could be 60 cards, and it could play more handtraps and it could even play branded. That is the point of zombies: pure creative liberty. My deck is built to mill; I can get through a turn and end with 6 cards in main and 4 in Extra. I don't play handtraps because I like to see how far I can take a deck with it's own power, and that means going first and praying they don't have hand traps, which in tear format means I have to watch out for an Imperm and a DD Crow which is more than doable.</p><p>I do not have enough monster zones, I often have to decide what would be the best end board I can make with only six monsters on it. Thanks to Elf, mezuki, and this decks amazing ability to spam lvl 8 monsters, Mad Mauler is the MVP. Make a lvl 10 synchro, bring back Chaos Ruler from the graveyard, bring back Mauler using elf, make another lvl 10 synchro, target one of those synchros with Mauler and summon Red-Eyes, to resummon that lvl 10 in the GY on your opponents turn. End Boards look like, Elf, Red-Eyes, Baronne, Chengying, Doomking, and Rulkallos. Sometimes I will hold off on the Red-Eyes effect to see what would be better, a Chengying, a Sycthe lock, or a second Doomking depending on how they respond to the first one. Sometimes you even have Superpoly or can send your Tears back with a shuffler only to mill again with Merrli and summon Dragostepelia. Anything, anything, anything you want do you can do with this deck, so start labbing because it has never been a better time to mill with zombies!</p>"

The list has kinda changed since last time I posted the first draft but with some changes in the extra deck and and some changes to non-engine cards as well as the side deck. I took out droll and gamma for ash and bystials as well as I put D barrier in the side because they limited gamma, banned super heavy scarecrow, limited purely delicous. You can play droll if you want still if you feel you need it but I believe thats up to you for decide. I chose ash, bystials and D barrier because I am asumming more people will play Branded and Striker since Engane got semi limited and Multi role became unlimited. Ash hits Branded fusion of course and bystials hit the archetype in general which is why I added them in as well as Labrynth. Dimensional barrier is reall good agaisnt Branded and even Kash shutting them off of XYZ, though Kashtira will probably still be the best deck. However I have thought about playing Belle in either the main or side because in testing I rn into alot of bytsials that would banish Visas in GY which hurts alot sincehe is the heart and soul of the deck. I believe we are in a bystial format so be aware of that going forward so be prepared. Another card I thought about playing was destrudo which is another card to add off of Magnamut but I will test more with it and come back with an updated deck if it works. In the extra deck I added IP Masquerena and Underworld goddess. I found myslef having a hard time outing chaos angel going first so that is why I put Underworld goddess and IP was added as just a more easy way to make unicorn if needed. You can play Accesscode if you want which isnt a bad idea but I would need to test more with it and see if it works well.</p>"

I tried to put in sakitama because its easy to summon and easy to get into alembertian or other link cyberse monsters to extend or start your plays. I added the micro coder package to add an extra form of distruption if you end up going into heatsoul. In the extra deck Im using Dark Fluid becuase of how versatile it is with I:P after you go first, and you can also use Dark Fluid plus Nabla if yuo start to go into time (I got this idea from ""The Duelist Cypher"" on youtube, I encourage you to watch his videos because of how entertaining they are). Side deck s pretty simple, Anti-Spell/Sekka for labrynth, DRNM for combo decks, belle for albaz if they try to lock you out, honestly you can switch the evenly matched for anything you like.&nbsp;</p>"
