Five months ago Deer Note wasn't even in Master Duel and Dante was in everyones ED to unbrick bad hands with Uni and E-Tele. Now? Zombies can mill a sixty card deck without grass, spam every lvl 8 and 10 synchro possible, they can scythe lock, have a floodgate field spell that can burden the best deck in the meta, and stops the second best deck, Floowandereeze, altogether. All this while no longer getting locked into zombies. Honestly this deck has become comparable to Adamancipators. Where Adamancipators still has less potential to brick an opening, the end board zombies can make deprecates on Adamacipators as a deck that utilizes a monster type rather than an archetype. You can do anything. Rarely have I not had all three mezuki in grave along with changshi, Chaos Ruler and Doomking. Put whatever you want in the Extra Deck, it doesn't matter, if it is generic and good (or not), zombies will make it. Accesscode, Apollousa, Underworld Goddess, Dweller, Bagooska, Baronne, Chengying, Elf; people are doing Stardust Dragon lines because they can. I know Tearlaments ARE the format, but I would still give zombies a try because they have never been so powerful.</p><p>With all that said, this is my deck! It could be 60 cards, and it could play more handtraps and it could even play branded. That is the point of zombies: pure creative liberty. My deck is built to mill; I can get through a turn and end with 6 cards in main and 4 in Extra. I don't play handtraps because I like to see how far I can take a deck with it's own power, and that means going first and praying they don't have hand traps, which in tear format means I have to watch out for an Imperm and a DD Crow which is more than doable.</p><p>I do not have enough monster zones, I often have to decide what would be the best end board I can make with only six monsters on it. Thanks to Elf, mezuki, and this decks amazing ability to spam lvl 8 monsters, Mad Mauler is the MVP. Make a lvl 10 synchro, bring back Chaos Ruler from the graveyard, bring back Mauler using elf, make another lvl 10 synchro, target one of those synchros with Mauler and summon Red-Eyes, to resummon that lvl 10 in the GY on your opponents turn. End Boards look like, Elf, Red-Eyes, Baronne, Chengying, Doomking, and Rulkallos. Sometimes I will hold off on the Red-Eyes effect to see what would be better, a Chengying, a Sycthe lock, or a second Doomking depending on how they respond to the first one. Sometimes you even have Superpoly or can send your Tears back with a shuffler only to mill again with Merrli and summon Dragostepelia. Anything, anything, anything you want do you can do with this deck, so start labbing because it has never been a better time to mill with zombies!</p>"

The list has kinda changed since last time I posted the first draft but with some changes in the extra deck and and some changes to non-engine cards as well as the side deck. I took out droll and gamma for ash and bystials as well as I put D barrier in the side because they limited gamma, banned super heavy scarecrow, limited purely delicous. You can play droll if you want still if you feel you need it but I believe thats up to you for decide. I chose ash, bystials and D barrier because I am asumming more people will play Branded and Striker since Engane got semi limited and Multi role became unlimited. Ash hits Branded fusion of course and bystials hit the archetype in general which is why I added them in as well as Labrynth. Dimensional barrier is reall good agaisnt Branded and even Kash shutting them off of XYZ, though Kashtira will probably still be the best deck. However I have thought about playing Belle in either the main or side because in testing I rn into alot of bytsials that would banish Visas in GY which hurts alot sincehe is the heart and soul of the deck. I believe we are in a bystial format so be aware of that going forward so be prepared. Another card I thought about playing was destrudo which is another card to add off of Magnamut but I will test more with it and come back with an updated deck if it works. In the extra deck I added IP Masquerena and Underworld goddess. I found myslef having a hard time outing chaos angel going first so that is why I put Underworld goddess and IP was added as just a more easy way to make unicorn if needed. You can play Accesscode if you want which isnt a bad idea but I would need to test more with it and see if it works well.</p>"

I tried to put in sakitama because its easy to summon and easy to get into alembertian or other link cyberse monsters to extend or start your plays. I added the micro coder package to add an extra form of distruption if you end up going into heatsoul. In the extra deck Im using Dark Fluid becuase of how versatile it is with I:P after you go first, and you can also use Dark Fluid plus Nabla if yuo start to go into time (I got this idea from ""The Duelist Cypher"" on youtube, I encourage you to watch his videos because of how entertaining they are). Side deck s pretty simple, Anti-Spell/Sekka for labrynth, DRNM for combo decks, belle for albaz if they try to lock you out, honestly you can switch the evenly matched for anything you like.&nbsp;</p>"

Using no meta cards, this deck relies entirely on the luck of a coin flip! If you call right, pop a card! If you call wrong, well, lets talk about that later!</p><p>Use the monstrous, mechanical dragons known as Desperado Barrel Dragon, Barrel Dragon and Blowback Dragon to blast your opponents cards off the board, but remember, you must believe in your coin to get you the best hits! Even if you do get a tripe Tails, you can use Proton Blast in the GY to make all your results Heads. It's not cheating if it's written on the card!</p><p>Other than the Barrel Dragons, you also have Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler, who will be a 4000 ATK beatstick once you get three monsters on the field, flip a coin and see what upgrade you can get on him! Alongside Arcana, you also have JINZO The Machine Menace, alongside his trusty sidekick Returner. Jinzo The Machine Menance will special summon himself as a 2400 ATK monster while a trap is in the GY or face up on the field (not a Quick Effect). He can whenever tribute himself to rid all traps on the field and summon Returner, who when destroyed will summon Machine Menace again from the GY, but only for a turn, so use him wisely!</p><p>You also have cards like BM-4 Spider who can destroy an opponents monster and inflict burn damage, along with the old Blast Sphere that can do similar work. The mini Twin-Barrel Dragon can pop a card if it tosses two Heads. Keeper and Prisma help to get your Gatling Dragon on the field, Keeper can also summon a Barrel Dragon or Blowback from the Deck, but only in facedown defence position, flip him back up the next turn to activate his effect! Fusion Deployment is a free Barrel or Blowback Dragon from the Deck. Heavy Metal Raiders will upgrade your Barrel Dragons considerably, protecting them and boosting their ATK, while also summoning more Dark Machines! Limiter Removal will double your Barrel Dragons up to 5600 ATK (not permanent).&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror Force is a classic way of protecting your board, and Call of The Haunted is yet another classic that brings back anything from the GY!</p><p>This isn't a great deck, but it is fun and nostalgic. Good luck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

(That's the reason you run 1 veiler, 1 ogre, and 1 evenly matched)</p><p>Q: No Iblee in main deck?</p><p>A: iblee is a very easy card to out, even if your oppenent doesn't have a link 1 they'll just normal summon a monster then go into phoneix (because everyone and there grandmas running it). But, I do believe it is worthy to side if your going up against lots of decks that don't want to give up there normal summon (purrely sometimes), can't normal summon (kashtira most of the time atleast), or decks that just don't want to special summon (floowandereeze). I would compare this card to ra's disciple in branded (which nobody runs emphasizing my point)</p>"

Theory was, Crystal beasts also use a lot of spells, which help trigger the second effect of your sky strikers, they also have a lot of good trap cards for countering the opponent, and as well as, can be *crystalised* to empty your main monster zone, to use sky striker spells. Also, helps for making bagooska if needed, and , since you mainly use links...you see what I mean.</p><p>Flaws; You have to run the brick of rainbowdragon, which, if you watched the replay , you know.

Most combos require two cards to get started, requiring a Mannadium ball + Starfrost himself - so this deck is maxed out on finding these two cards as much as possible. With this current iteration of the deck, if this combination isn't present in your hand, boards will be suboptimal or non-existent (essentially you bricked).&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">A small hero engine is included with 3 ""A Hero Lives"" and 2 ""Elemental Hero Prisma."" Prisma is extremely useful in this deck representing about two resources upon summon, being able to foolish burial Visas Starfrost (material for Astraloud) and act as Visas on-field, turning on your Mannadium monster's special summon. Since he is ""Visas Starfrost"" on-field,you can also link him off to summon Scareclaw Light-Heart, further enabling your plays.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">9 slots are saved for staple cards, and they are the most impactful handtraps of the meta, Ash Blossom (counters Branded and Labrynth), Droll (counters Mannadium and PUNK Gold Pride) and Impermanence is very versatile in every situation. These 9 slots can be exchanged with side deck cards, allowing your deck to be ready for different match-ups.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><div><span class=""ContentPasted9"">This deck's limiting factor is consistency. It faces the problem that a similar older combo deck had, Virtual World. It needed combo pieces to be present in hand or else you've straight up bricked. There aren't any ""one card starters"" in this deck like Branded Fusion, Mathmech Circular or Weclome Labrynth - you'll need at least two combo pieces, and three is optimal. This problem will soon be fixed (I think) with the upcoming DUNE support. However with CYAC, this deck suffers consistency issues, leaving it prone to bricking and having less room in-deck for staple cards.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span><br /></strong></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">&nbsp;</strong></span></strong></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">The strategy for Mannadium is straightforward (summon level 10 synchros + 3 mat Apollousa) while combos are linear, despite hands being different.

You also have materials in GY next turn to create a Astraloud and if Dis Pater survives until next turn, he can summon Riumheart from banished pile to as follow-up to get more resources from deck. What makes this board extra special&nbsp; is that it can withstand a Dark Ruler no More/Forbidden Droplet since Reframing is a backrow omni-negate.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The optimal deck's endboard is an extremely potent powerhouse that all decks would be hard-pressed to deal with. Depending on the cards in-hand and whatever interruptions your opponent has, your resulting endboard from this combo vary in power, depending on how much you bricked and how many times you've been interrupted.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This deck can also sustain being hit by several handtraps and keep on comboing, since it offers many extenders and different lines of play.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Going second, this deck naturally breaks boards with Primitive Planet Reichphobia, Astraloud, Baronne and Chaos Angel removing cards. However, as it combos, the strategy is vulnerable to interruption, preferring to go first. The good news is that the Mannadium ""ball"" combo pieces float (not once per turn btw) when they are destroyed, so you can keep on going if your opponent opts to destroy them.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""ContentPasted10"">Mannadium can easily churn out over 9000ATK on board with at least 4 removals requiring minimal investment. When you've baited out all their interruptions going for the regular combo, you can pivot your strategy for the Astraloud + Accesscode OTK. First Link two monsters for Cross-Sheep on board. Contact fuse Visas Starfrost + Visas Clone in GY for Astraloud (1 pop) to a zone Cross-Sheep is pointing to so you can summon another monster from the GY. Link Cross-Sheep + another monster for Knightmare Unicorn (1 spin). Link Knightmare Unicorn + monster for Accesscode Talker (2 pops). And there we have it, 4 removals and over 9000ATK on board for OTK!</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div></div><div><div><div><span><span><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">GENERAL TIPS</span></strong></span></span></div><div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">&nbsp;</span></span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ul data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">As you combo, be aware of the zones you're summoning in, or else you may stop your combo in it's tracks! For Light-Heart, keep the monster zone below it empty, so you can summon Reichheart below it.

While it is possible to play through these cards if your starting hand is strong, your board will be weaker. An option to use for this is 3 Crossout Designator + 1 of each handtrap to stop them.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">An interesting variant of the deck is True King version, where level 9s summon themselves from hand by destroying your Mannadium ""balls,"" triggering both of their effects!

Both archetypes hold immense synergy with each other, so I may begin testing the True King variant for their viability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">Is your combo stopped by a pesky floodgate?

The playstyle is a straightforward combo with little variance. I find that there is no uniqueness with this deck, since its only used as an engine to turbo out generic boss monsters, (Baronne, Apollousa, Dis Pater, etc.) rather than something in-archetype. Even their iconic level 10 boss synchro, Mannadium Prime-Heart is abandoned in favour of more competitive level 10s! With my complaints being said, I believe the next wave of support from DUNE will give this deck an actual personality and identity with ""Visas Amritara."" When that buster blade wielding badass is released, Mannadium will be more thematic, rather than merely being a shell to summon generic boss monsters. This deck is only getting stronger with future support!&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">In honour of the inferior Mannadium Prime-Heart who will never be competitively viable (card designers what are you thinking?!), here is the infamous Mannadium copy-pasta, ran through the ""OwOifier:""</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof ContentPasted6""><em>""Mannadium Pwime-Heawt has a speciaw defensive abiwity thawt stops youw opponent fwom tawgeting iwt with cawd effects.

These cards have the main advantages: they greatly <strong>increase the consistency</strong> of the deck and you can <strong>access Baronne de Fleur</strong> easily. The third big application is that you <strong>have more ways to play after opponent interactions</strong> which is a weakness of Dinosaur because the deck has a lot of normal summons and few <strong>hand extenders</strong> and Xeno Meteors is an exceptional extender to keep playing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My intention when playing Dinosaur after the <strong>Miscellaneousaurus limitation</strong> has always been to continue <strong>playing second</strong> because his cards are not good against <strong>hand traps going first</strong> and when necessary to go first I can make the same end board that the deck alone has always been able to to do which is <strong>Evolzar Dolkka as the first extra deck monster protecting the rest of your turn</strong> and then <strong>Tyranno + Omega to return Miscellaneousaurus</strong> to the GY as a follow up which is the exact opposite of what most people do in the deck which is fill up the <strong>deck of unnecessary bricks</strong> to make an end board that when it passes it makes <strong>5 to 6 negates and without any follow up</strong> which means that if you take Dark Ruler No More and the opponent clears the field with AA-Zeus for example you automatically lose the game on the way back.</p><p>If you intend to <strong>play with a Dice Roll</strong> deck with <strong>no space for tech cards</strong>, which uses a <strong>lot of horrible brick</strong>, it makes a combo that <strong>loses to all the hand traps</strong> in the game, which <strong>lock you into specific monsters in the extra deck</strong> that make your options scarce and bad when you go second and there's <strong>no follow up</strong> so that's what you'll find and get frustrated trying to play and lose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if you want a deck with <strong>consistency, versatility and power</strong> then this is the version of Dinosaur that I recommend using because now the deck has so <strong>much consistency</strong> that your starting hands are very redundant if the deck has 40 cards besides you <strong>have no room for tech cards</strong> like hand traps. So it's best to increase to <strong>60 cards and use Small World</strong> to increase starting hand combinations and always <strong>choose to go second</strong> so you can get the best combinations of blind second cards as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>extra deck is standard</strong> for what I consider to be the right way to play Dinosaur which is to focus on Xyz. The only big change you can do is to <strong>test it and remove the Psyframe engine from the main deck and Lambda</strong> because after the banlist in a <strong>mediocre way limits Gamma</strong> it is a card that can be cut without difficulties from the decklist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>////////////////////////////////////</p><p>Below I'll leave some <strong>very basic combos in the right and simple way to play with the new cards</strong> that Baronne de Fleur has access to:</p><p>Remember that Oviraptor + Baby = Oviraptor + Miscellaneousaurus = Miscellaneousaurus + Baby = Archosaur + Baby</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-50167039</p><p><strong>COMBO 1</strong>: Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus (Play Around Hand Traps)</p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Dolkka + Omega + Lambda</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-50167148</p><p><strong>COMBO 2</strong>: Ground Xeno + Babycerasaurus</p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Baronne de Fleur + Omega + Lambda</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-50167479</p><p><strong>COMBO 3</strong>: Lost World + Ground Xeno + Babycerasaurus (Full Combo Play Around Nibiru)</p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Dolkka + Baronne de Fleur + Omega + Lambda</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had even made a <strong>version with Ogdoadic</strong> that also talks about the <strong>right and detailed way to use this new engine</strong>. The version with Ogdoadic is more for fun but it was <strong>created with the aim of solving Dinosaur's biggest problem: how sensitive the deck is to hand traps when it goes first</strong>. In this version you have <strong>more ways to continue playing after taking hand traps and the follow ups are the best possible</strong> so I leave below the link of this version for those who are interested in knowing:</p><p>https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/scrap-dino-transcendrake-apr23-format-323446</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p>The <strong>next ""evolution"" of the Dinosaur deck</strong> will be <strong>Kaitoptera with Horned Saurus</strong>. These cards basically <strong>replace Giant Rex</strong> in the deck and allow you to <strong>access Lost World every turn plus you have Polymerization available</strong> either to make Guardian Chimera or to be a discard of Link Knightmare. Until then, this is the best way to use Dinosaur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Disregard the side deck because, like the tech cards I use in the main deck, you can adapt to the reality of the competitive format or where you play.</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////</p>"

And other spice","<p><em>A kinda Budget build for Branded Despia</em></p><p>I have Quem, but if you don't have it's not essential to play. If you have Cartesia you definitely want to switch Ecclesia for her.&nbsp;</p><p>We play Winda, cause it's really easy to do with Lubellion and the only Shaddoll target that's in the deck isn't useless cause you can have a draw by discarding it (Branded Opening, Lubellion's cost, Branded Fusion...).</p><p>The main line of play to use in a good way Winda is to have Branded Fusion and Branded In Red. We send from deck Albaz and Shaddoll Beast and we summon Lubellion with this. Discard for Lubellion's cost (chain 1). Then you chain Branded In Red (chain 2) taking Albaz from GY and you have to make Mirrorjade by using Albaz from hand and Lubellion from Field. And then Lubellion is going to shuffle itself and Beast into the deck to make Winda. With this we will end with Mirrorjade and Winda <em>(Notes: that's not the main line of play for the deck, but surely it's a good one. Other thing, this combo is possible to do even under Shifter)</em></p><p>The Shaddoll name it's for sure a brick if drawn in first hand or by top deck, but we have plenty of ways to use it as a cost for cards to use his effect to draw or as a fusion material, considering that Winda only requests a Dark Monster other than the Shaddoll one, and our deck is mostly composed by Dark Monsters</p><p>But maybe there's another question: why Ecclesia tho? I chose to play Ecclesia cause she can cheat out Albaz from deck during the opponent's turn, and you'll able to do his effect by stealing a opponent's monster.</p><p>The best way we want to use Ecclesia it's by using Branded Opening in the opponent's Standby Phase, and summon Quem with that. With Quem you can send Ecclesia from deck to GY, and with her second effect you'll summon Ecclesia too, that will send herself to GY and Special Summon Albaz (that's more easy if you actually try that instead of reading the explanation lol)</p><p><em>(Note: this combo isn't possible to do under Shifter)</em></p><p><strong>Edge Imp Engine</strong>: I personally love to play it for the fact that is a way to play after an Ash on BraFu and let you plus</p><p><strong>Allure Of Darkness</strong>: we like to have a good amount of cards in hand to do our stuff, and the synergy with Mercurier and Tragedy it's fantastic</p><p>Other spice, the <strong>Borreload fusion</strong> (I refuse to write the whole name). It's a good target for Albaz's effect, Branded in Red or Lubellion. And he pops an opponent card. Remember you can dodge the destruction of out Fusions by Branded Opening effect in the GY</p><p>Side is pretty standard, I thought about playing <strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>,but I have to find some space. Maybe you can cut the Dark Ruler No More, but we have to see how the meta will go. You can even play <strong>Enemy Controller or Forbidden Chalice in the side deck</strong>, is all about what you like to play and how the format goes. Advice a second copy of <strong>Masquerade</strong> for winning at the time. But I repeat, that's a personal choice</p><p>We don't play the new Albion that locks with the Gimmick Puppet for two reasons: Albion it's a pricey card (even Quem is pricey, but you can take her out from the deck. Instead Albion is the only way to do the lock) and I really don't like the lock, and Winda it's a good way to lock too</p><p>Last thing I swear: if you have Cartesia play her, but I'm broke. Same discourse with Super Polymerization (you can play three Spoly by cutting Ash and another card)</p><p>Much love, hope I explained in a decent way. Ask if you need, I'll try to answer</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

In my main, I love versatile cards that work well 1st or 2nd. Examples of these are Jowgen and Moon Mirror Shield. When side decking, I only run a couple of additional ""going 1st"" floodgate options, Summon Limit and TCBOO. I used to run 2-3 copies of Dark Bribe to protect my board, but I've recently dropped the card in lieu of running more ""going 2nd"" cards in the side. All of my ""going 2nd"" cards are board-breakers. No hand traps whatsoever. I feel like hand traps are terrible in Stun. Most meta players can play around 1 or 2 hand traps, and you, as the Stun player have now depleted your hand of 1 to 2 cards just for the sake of mildly slowing them down. I prefer to let them over-extend, build a big board, and break it.<br /><br />Oh, and Yata Garasu ends up being the MVP pretty frequently. One of my biggest fears as a Stun player is my opponent drawing ""the out"". However....you can't draw ""the out"" if you can't draw at all....</p>"

I used to run it without maxx c and superpoly, but I found that it struggled going second so I added them.&nbsp;</p><p>The Starving Venome, Predaplant and Mudragon are for the superpoly, but can be made using Tear fusion (except the Starving which can only be made using superpoly).</p><p>An ideal combo would be milling 9 cards using the PUNK engine, which activates the Tear engine to mill another 8. If you mill the Ishizu cards thats a further 10 mill so that's 26 cards milled in total without grass.</p><p>Check out the YT video for gameplay and the ideal first turn board.</p><p>Hope you like it.</p>"

Easy to summon, with an extender effect (would be in the main deck if it was searchable and not a hard once per turn).</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Number 39: Utopia &amp; S39 Utopia the Lightning: Generic Rank 4 that can rank up into Lightning. Just a 5000 ATK beatstick if needed.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Tornado Dragon: Excellent backrow removal in a generic Rank 4. If Shi En and Savage aren't enough anti-backrow, this card is more than enough.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Number 101: Silent Honor ARK: Problematic card removal, similar purpose to Castel. Generic Rank 4.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Leviair the Sea Dragon: Rank 3 extender. Revive any of your Secret Six Samurai monsters (that banish themselves from the GY as protection) or whoever you banished with Hatsume effect.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Called by the Grave: This is your only hope against Ash or Droll if you don't have any omni- negates on board. Stuns hurt this deck badly.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(3)Musakani Magatama: 100% tech card/side deck option.

Contains all cards that Mako used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not much is known about his first deck, but I believe it didn't change much from his Battle City one.</p><p>But it is clear that, this early on, ""Kairiyu-Shin"" (Leviathan) was his ace card.</p><p>Mako probably also had Legendary Fisherman and Fortress Whale around this time, they just weren't shown. His Tornado Wall strategy would probably be too much during this era, so let's just give him that in Battle City.</p><p>Notice that, some of the monster choices, are there because of Fortress Whale's materials on the games (I went for that approach for Duelist Kingdom Decks). They also heavily implied that he has a Raigeki in the deck, especially in the games (which I also checked and used to build this deck - I'm looking at you Duel Monsters 1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His tactic against Yugi (on his first duel) was mostly just hiding his monsters underwater for a surprise Sea Stealth Attack (but for a supposed fair duelist, he wasn't doing much differently than Panik, so why wasn't he called out?).</p><p>And for those saying that the ""Attack the Moon!"" was bs in this Duel, you might also try to remember how Yugi's Equip Spell indirectly raised the tides (that was one weird backfire, but alright). Yugi finished the Duel with Curse of Dragon AND Burning Land, which destroys all Field Spell cards - getting rid of Umi, so it wasn't totally out-of-nowhere, right? Well I'd like to believe that but we already know how Duelist Kingdom rules were something else...</p><p>I added those 2 newer cards to the Side Deck in nod to his Duel with Yugi. They were made to refference it and I think they're honestly really cool.</p>"

Contains all cards that he used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This guy has several names - he was a ventriloquist in the manga, but in the anime he's more of a creepy clown.</p><p>He appeared once just to never return ever again. Mind Crush really did a number on him.</p><p>This is a slightly better version of the Deck that Kaiba used against Yugi (on their first Duel from the anime), all with some extras included. Think that you can spot all cards that seem out of place in this Deck? There should be, at least, 3 of them... they mostly are just taking the place of cards that are to be first revealed in this season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This character was used a few times in the early games and it's honestly really neat not seeing him as completely forgotten.</p><p>The Side Deck contains cards that were drops from him in the games. I thought that it would be a cool thing to add.</p><p>Now, Kaiba at this point of the story was in a coma, that's why its Deck was stolen easily, but next time Kaiba gets his hands on the Deck, he's got some surprises up his sleeve...</p>"

Contains all cards that Bonz used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bonz, while known to use a Zombie Deck, used some sort of regular monsters with a catch - he revives them back up again as Zombies.</p><p>But ""Call of the Haunted"" was given to him by Bandith Keith, so it kinda leaves us thinking... what was he using before that? A bunch of ghost monsters? The Deck he runs in WC2004 is pretty funny because he just runs something else entirely, so it's fun to think about it.</p><p>For the sake of being a bit more close to the anime (and his first duel), I gave him 3 ""Call of the Haunted"".</p><p>In the Side Deck you can find the first Ritual monster (which is also a Zombie) ""Dokuroraider"". Decided to give him that because, in Duelist Kingdom, Rituals were used quite a few times. I'm also going for the Forbidden Memories Rules and didn't put it in the Main Deck (we don't really see them have the Ritual monsters in hand anyway, the rules for Rituals were still pretty hazy back then).</p><p>The 3 iconic Low-Level 0 Defense Normal monsters should be put in the Side Deck, as they were more like transformations than actual cards. The ones they were originally (Crawling Dragon, Zanki and Dream Clown) are all in the Main Deck, however.</p><p>Any weak Normal monsters could be part of his previous Deck (the Ghost Deck), as they're on theme.

Contains all cards that PaniK used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think most of us remember this guy because of his monsters' weird statlines. Let's hope that we can get retrains of such cards now that the Illusionist type has finally been announced.</p><p>There always seems to be something weird with his Deck, as he runs the most useless monsters ever.</p><p>And then Castle of Dark Illusions had its effect changed to Zombies??? What a disservice.</p><p>You can battle him on Legacy of Duelist and Nightmare Troubadour (he was pretty menacing here, with a Shadow Game and all) but his Decks were always trash, I can't believe he beat Mai.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, added a few monsters that are Fusion Materials for his Fusion monsters and added a few Rituals (seems like everyone almost goes to a consensus that he'd run 1 or more of such Ritual monsters).</p><p>""Dust Barrier"" is really similar to one of the effects of the ""Castle of Dark Illusions"" in the anime and ""Swords of Concealing Light"" is a good rival for ""Swords of Revealing Light"", that Yugi used to reveal his monsters (""Dark Mirror Force"" also has this logic behind it).</p><p>In the Side Deck, there's the Ritual Monsters (since Ritual Summoning in the anime didn't really show the Ritual monster in the Hand, so they're probably like Forbidden Memories) and some burn cards (representing his attempt to burn Yugi alive after losing). ""Ultimate Obedient Fiend"" just looks like a card he'd definitely use, but I'm not sure how that would go in the anime, since he has more ATK power than Blue-Eyes and wasn't even meantioned once (a missed opportunity I'd say).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I'll be treating Ritual monsters as the ones from Forbidden Memories too (and not having them as Main Deck cards).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Final Boss of Duelist Kingdom and very memorable villain.</p><p>There's a few of cards that Pegasus owns that don't exist at the time of writing this. I substituted the following cards:</p><p>- Mermaid's Tear -&gt; Spellbinding Circle</p><p>- Eye of Deception -&gt; Change of Heart</p><p>- Magic Neutralizing Force -&gt; Imperial Order</p><p>- Negative Energy -&gt; (deppending on the situation, Megamorph or Reverse Trap)</p><p>- Prophecy -&gt; Confiscation (Pegasus can see the opponent's hand anyway)</p><p>- Trap Displacement -&gt; (One of the Mirror trap cards)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the Deck seems a bit too different than usual, that's because ""Toon World"" was different in the anime and it could turn other monsters into Toons (not something that already exists). There's a few cards that are not known in his Deck, but due to them having Toon versions, we could imagine that he also has them in the Deck (""Toon Masked Sorcerer"" and ""Toon Cannon Soldier"").</p><p>I also added those 3 Side Deck cards for flexing (you know which ones I'm talking about), he is the creator of the game, afterall.</p><p>Strange deck indeed, it's not what is usually seen for him, but I tried to make it more like Duelist Kingdom this time. And Pegasus is strange, so it fits in my opinion. For a proper playable deck for him and more in touch with what he usually uses in the games, perhaps I'll do it for later seasons...</p><p>This was all really fun to make, but it sure took a lot of time.</p><p>I'll be doing more in a near future perhaps :))</p>"

When piloting this deck, there are two key factors you must always keep in mind: cost and effect. Every hand you draw should have playability, meaning you should be able to make meaningful moves regardless of the initial cards you receive.</p><p>For your side deck, it's essential to include cards like ""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"" to counter your biggest threats, such as ""Abyss Dweller"" and other similar cards. Additionally, ""Chaos Hunter"" is an unfortunate but necessary inclusion to combat certain banish strategies that may pose a challenge. It's worth noting that ""Chaos Hunter"" can be brought back to the field using ""Muckraker,"" providing additional utility.</p><p>Regarding the Fiend lock, it shouldn't be a significant issue since both ""Kaleido Heart"" and ""Grapha"" are Fiends themselves. This synergy allows for strong plays and interactions within the deck.</p><p>In your side deck, include cards like 'Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries' to counter major threats such as 'Abyss Dweller.' Additionally, 'Chaos Hunter' is vital against banish strategies, despite its drawbacks. 'Chaos Hunter' can be revived using 'Muckraker,' adding versatility to your plays.</p><p>The Fiend lock shouldn't be problematic since both 'Kaleido Heart' and 'Grapha' are Fiends themselves, enabling strong synergy and interactions within the deck.</p><p>When side decking, consider removing 1 'Eldlich,' 1 'Bear,' and 1 'Big Welcome' to optimize your strategy.""</p><p>update: This is my TCG version of the deck I previously mentioned, which operates identically to the OCG version with a few key differences. In the OCG, there's a card called 'New World Formation' that adds recursion, providing an advantage not yet available in the TCG. However, the TCG version has access to better options like 'Gura Wings' and 'Toadally Awesome,' which can enhance your plays. As newer cards are released, I will update the deck list accordingly. If you have the extra funds to spare, you could consider adding a 'Kashira Fenrir' package instead of 'Chaos Hunter.' However, I decided to stick with 'Chaos Hunter' due to the prevalence of 'Bystials' in the current meta. I welcome any suggestions or ideas you may have, so please feel free to leave a comment.

This was made the morning the new pack released, so definitely suboptimal in a lot of ways. Regardless, I do believe this is the best type of Dragonmaid deck you can make. The Bystial package just has a lot of useful synergies with Dragonmaid that I believe are worth exploring. Without any further ado, let's get into it.</p><p>Branded:</p><ul><li>3x Albaz to make sure Branded Fusion is online at basically all times.</li><li>3x Branded Fusion to make said BraFu targets.</li><li>1x Springans Kitt for a Rindbrumm target and a BraFu searcher.</li><li>1x Branded Retribution to dump with Saronir, might consider replacing if I can find a better thing to dump after Bystial Lubellion is put into the GY.</li><li>1x Cartesia, because I don't want to spend the UR dust on extra copies right now. Really good card, walking Polymerization that adds herself back to the hand from grave if you dumped a Fusion in the grave that turn.</li></ul><p>Bystial:</p><ul><li>1x Magnumhut because he's limited. Run as many copies as legally allowed, this guy is by far the best Bystial for this strategy.</li><li>2x Saronir and 2x Baldrake, since I need a decent amount of Bystials for this strategy in general. Both have useful effects, though I haven't procced Baldrake in a duel yet.</li><li>1x Druiswurm because it's limited. I'd probably run a ratio of something like 3x Magnumhut, 2x Druiswurm, 1x each of Saronir and Baldrake if it were up to me, but I sadly don't control the banlist.</li><li>1x Lubellion. More are worth considering, he replaces himself with a usable Bystial if you draw him, but I don't want to spend the UR dust on the extra copies yet.</li><li>1x Branded Regained and 1x Branded Beast as targets for Lubellion. Regained gives a lot of resource accumulation, and Beast gives proactive disruption.</li></ul><p>Dragonmaid:</p><ul><li>3x Chamber, because she's literally the best Dragonmaid gameplay-wise (cutest is Laundry, but she really doesn't fit into this specific deck).</li><li>2x Parlor because I wanted a few extra Dragonmaids to access Sheou better. I... might end up cutting her, as I have been bricking on Parlor a lot. That said, definitely the next best option to use after Chamber.</li><li>1x Changeover to make Sheou, but can also be used to make the fusion Lubellion and any other Dragon fusion monster in the deck.</li><li>1x Hospitality mostly because. Another card I might cut, as it just doesn't do enough TBH. We're not nearly as NS reliant in this build as regular Dragonmaid, since we have so many different playmakers between the Bystial and Branded engines.</li><li>2x Tidying. Just a generally good trap in Dragon decks, both disruption and a way to get another body onto the field.</li></ul><p>Rest of the Main Deck is just various staples and generic cards, not really an interesting discussion there. Fusion Deployment can be run at however many copies you desire, it summons Cartesia or Albaz straight from deck for basically no cost beyond a Fusion lock for the turn.</p><p>Extra Deck:</p><ul><li>Lubellion, Albion, Mirrorjade are basically standard for any deck using the Branded engine, so I won't bother reiterating the most basic combo of the archetype.</li><li>Alba-lenatus is a hate crime against Dragon Link, so of course I run it. Also good to summon off Lubellion if you have a bunch of dragons in grave you'd rather have in your deck, though this ain't really the deck for that. Usually just the second thing you'd use as Mirrorjade ammo after Albion though.</li><li>Rindbrumm is an Albaz target to finally kill Floo, and also your other thing to summon off BraFu. It also gives Branded a negate, which is really appreciated even if I wish it was a Spell/Trap negate.</li><li>1x Sheou and 2x House for Dragonmaid stuff. Gives you an omni, you can use the Bystials as material for Sheou, you probably know how this works if you've ever played Dragonmaid.</li><li>Garura, Starving Venom, and Mudragon are Super Poly targets. I'd argue Starving Venom is possibly the most important one to keep around, as sometimes you run into a big 4K+ monster you can't beat over otherwise, but all of them are replacable if you don't want to use Super Poly.</li><li>Granguinol to summon off Cartesia and dump a Level 6+ LIGHT/DARK. Garura can be dumped for a draw, if we had Chamber's dragon form we'd probably dump that, and Saronir can be used to dump a Branded Spell/Trap. Quaeritis is there as our Despia ED target, I'm replacing it with Luluwalilith once she comes out.</li><li>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres to give us a thing to end on if we have spare bodies, and Underworld Goddess to out Towers and the like. Spheres can be probably be replaced, Verte Anaconda would be a good immediate option if you're not sure.</li></ul><p>And that's the deck as I have it built! Feel free to ask any questions, I'm going to get back to bricking with this stupid thing.</p>"

So in addition to heavenly dragon circle i can play with litte fear of interruption. Gold sarcophagus, is a turn starter and extender, you could banish blackout to get a free lv 4 just in case they pop your token, or negate your swordsoul monsters, or your could banish a target for a graveyard adhara to return to your hand , another option is just making a token so tenyi monsters are live. The extra and side are flexable, id like to add that gravity collapse &amp; Crimson Blader and potentional game enders. Hope you guys enjoy the deck!i would love some feedback or tips</p>"

I'm only on 2 Maxx C simply because I couldn't find another slot for number 3 and I, personally, kept bricking by opening multiple. Thunder Dragon can be inconsistent so I never want to open a full house of Maxx C and OG Thunder Dragon.&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of the Level 2 Earth Insect. This deck plays well under it. If you see it you only have to special summon once or twice to get to SUS or Titan.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your ideal end board is Branded Beast, Lubellion, Sus + a link 2 of either Verte to make Titan on top or I:P.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sitting on Sus + a pop with some Bystials is good enough to take a lot of games and to win on the crack back and you're fine to play second - which I did regularly - with this list as you can see from the replays in the video.&nbsp;</p>"

This card is unbelievably strong depending how much damage you can make with this card. This isn't an actual FTK but a functual FTK. That's how traps work. We are playing exactly 41 spells to make 8000 damage for game. The one last spell is always ""Cursed Bamboo Sword"". To make this happen you need to have access to ""Royal Magical Library"" and draw your entire deck. Cards like ""Card of Demise"" and ""Into the void"" help you discard the other spells in your hand in the end phase. Because we are playing so many draw spells there's no need to use extra deck cards. But if you know a better way to make this more consistent please let me know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Just trying to find a deck to play this format with a bunch of Spright and Adamancipator cards just sitting around somewhere? Well, my friend, you've come to the right place! Introducing Vanquish Soul Adamancipator Spright, a combination of decks that sounds ridiculous but actually works really well.</p><p>Now these three decks on their own are absolutely amazing. Spright can build a board of interactions and negates, Adamancipator... does basically the same thing, and Vanquish Soul can easily disrupt your opponent's plays at Quick Effect speed. So, really nice, huh? So how do they all work together?</p><p>Well, quite simple, really... Vanquish Soul monsters have effects that require them to reveal certain monsters with certain Attributes from the hand, which are DARK, EARTH, and FIRE. These 3 Attributes are necessary in order to activate certain effects, like <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=92895501"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/92895501.jpg"" data-card=""92895501"" data-name=""Vanquish Soul Heavy Borger"">Vanquish Soul Heavy Borger</span></a> providing draw power (and <em>maybe</em> burning for time) and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=91073013"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/91073013.jpg"" data-card=""91073013"" data-name=""Vanquish Soul Caesar Valius"">Vanquish Soul Caesar Valius</span></a> and <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=29302858"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/29302858.jpg"" data-card=""29302858"" data-name=""Vanquish Soul Razen"">Vanquish Soul Razen</span></a> can easily pop cards on the field.

Compared to other lists, I have decided to cut Diviner for deck space and opted to play triple Ultimate Slayer instead.</span></p><p><span>Ultimate Slayer allows you to not only get rid of your opponent's pesky monsters (like Rulkallos and whatnot) as well as give you the opportunity to opt into a multitude of plays with your extra deck monsters and its unfounded ""Once per Turn"" clause allows you to capitalize off Maxx C by utilizing it multiple times, whereas Diviner would simply be rotting in your hand.</span></p><p>The main downside to not playing Diviner would be your innability to go for the Maxiimus line easily with Almiraj and Secura Gardna, however since your normal summon is not spent on Diviner, you may make use of Cartesia which allows you to go into Granguignol during yours or your opponent's Main Phase. And although not optimal, normal summoning Ecclesia is also a choice.</p><p>Since this deck does not have a high need for the Extra Deck, playing triple Super Polymerization feels only natural and with the arrival of Garura, the -1 required to activate it will feel trivial. The Bystials are obviously strong monsters specially in a meta dominated by Tearlaments and the synergy this deck has with Regained may allow you to get the follow-up much needed for this ""ritual"" deck.

This deck has cards specifically picked out for the June 2023 meta, like Triple Tactics Talent (super good since everyone uses Branded, Flundereeze, and handtraps, etc).<br /><br />The current meta allows for Evenly Matched and Raigeki to obliterate most duelist's boards this format since they spend all their resources building their ""unbreakable"" board only to fall to 1-2 cards. <br /><br /><br />When your opponent forces you to go 1st thinking all you do is spam ""Raigeki"" and ""Evenly Matched,"" metagame them by siding in devastating floodgates like TCBOO and Grave of the Superancient Organism!<br /><br />If your weakened opponent hasn't surrendered yet due to the sheer resource advantage and offensive pressure this deck generates, you can clear the board with a plethora of cards including Linkage, allowing Raye to OTK all by herself!<br /><br />If you have any questions about this deck, feel free to ask me in the comments below!<br /><br /></p><p><strong><em><a>Want to see the deck in action?

Dogmatika Ritual was once pretty bad, with being bricky and not even having great payoffs for the Rituals on their own.</p><p>That era, is no longer. Alba Zoa and Dogmatikamatrix have ushered in a new era of anti-ED dueling, and while not meta this deck packs a significant punch and can play with the big boys with the right tech (and a good hand). Let's start with the main engine:</p><ul><li>3x Ecclesia, as we need to search all the useful Dogmatika engine somehow. She herself can be searched via Nadir Servant, and the second search of Dogmatikamatrix can do so as well.</li><li>1x of the original main deck bosses of Dogmatika, Fleurdelis and Maximus. They're still good cards, but Maximus only bolsters good boards and Fleurdelis' negate only activates if you have a second Dogmatika on the board so we don't want to just draw into them on their own. Cut Maximus if you want to.</li><li>3x Dogmatikamatrix. Searches a Dogmatika Ritual, whether a monster or spell, and if your opponent has a monster on field you get to search any Dogmatika card. Also lets you scout your opponent's extra if you control a Dogmatika Ritual, giving you the ability to comfortably decide whether you want to use Alba Zoa's effect, or you can just dump something from your extra to proc useful effects.</li><li>3x Dogmatikalamity, our primary Ritual spell. It can use a Fusion/Synchro monster from the Extra Deck as material for your Ritual, meaning the inherent minus of Ritual Spells is now closer to even (or even a plus, depending on what you're sending and how you can benefit from it). Make sure you have at least one Level 12 for Alba Zoa.</li><li>1x Dogmatikamacabre, our secondary Ritual spell. This is usually used to summon White Relic, since you'll typically have a Level 4 in grave to banish and you'd have probably spent your use of Dogmatikalamity for the turn.</li><li>1x Branded in Central Dogmatika, enables you to further benefit from Ritual summons by dumping an ED monster of your choice from either players ED. Can be cut, it's only good for further bolstering good hands.</li><li>3x Dogmatika Punishment. One of the best Trap cards ever printed in general, so of course we run it in its namesake deck.</li><li>1x Dogmatika Alba Zoa. Alba Zoa, the corrupted form of Maximus, is a crazy powerful boss monster... with a few asterisks attached. For starters, his protection only applies to Extra Deck monsters, and only to activated effects. Which means he is unable to do anything about Spell/Traps, main deck monsters, or lingering effects (like, say, Mirrorjade's field wipe effect). However, if you can get it onto the field, you'll be able to force your opponent to dump 7 cards from their Extra, discard from their hand, or if they have no Extra Deck left shuffle all their ED monsters back. Combine that with his tremendous 4k/4k statline, and some decks just plain don't have an out to him.</li><li>1x White Relic of Dogmatika. Aside from being cute, she's Alba Zoa's biggest supporter by removing one of his weaknesses (being destroyed by things bigger than him) and our OTK enabler. She also dumps a monster of your choice from your opponent's ED if your opponent summons from it, making things harder for your opponent. Her main role though, is to buff herself to 4.5k with Alba Zoa and beat your opponent to death with him.</li><li>1x Nadir Servant. Not technically a Dogmatika card by name, but important for the archetype. I run one due to economics, run as many copies as you can. Searching literally any Dogmatika while dumping a monster from the ED is just good (note that the only monster with over 4k we have is Five-Headed Dragon, who is our only target for summon Alba Zoa with Dogmatikalamity, so just be careful with how you do your combo).</li><li>I don't run White Knight as I don't want to brick on Rituals any more than I already do and I find I'm never going for it over Alba Zoa or White Relic, but it is a strong card that is more proactive with playing on your opponent's turn.</li></ul><p>For side engine stuff, we run Bystials to deal with other LIGHT/DARK decks, Diviner of the Herald as a NS to send Arc Light, and Shaddoll Schism to summon Winda. Everything else is just tech cards from the basic MD handtrap suite to boardbreakers, which can be switched as you desire to suit the meta.</p><p>The ED:</p><ul><li>3x Herald of the Arc Light. We're playing a Ritual deck that dumps cards from ED to grave, of course we're playing this. It's technically possible to summon this under an extremely narrow circumstance (having both Diviner and Maxx C on field), but realisitically speaking you won't be summoning this.</li><li>1x Elder Entity N'tss. We're playing a deck that dumps ED cards, of course we run one of the best Dogmatika Punishment targets. More copies are a good idea, I only own one so I just run one.</li><li>1x Fossil Warrior Skull Knight, Fossil Machine Skull Wagon, Mereologic Aggregator, Garura Wings of Resonant Life, Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom, Granguignol the the Dusk Dragon, other things to dump. There's plenty of other targets you can pick to dump, these are just the ones I went with.</li><li>1x of Apkallone and Winda, our method of using the Schism engine. Dump Apkallone, grab Schism and discard, make Winda next turn and floodgate your opponent.</li><li>1x Five-Headed Dragon as a Dogmatikalamity target to summon Alba Zoa. Can be replaced by any Level 12, but a DARK one is preferred for the Bystial and Schism engines. Despian Lulawalilith would probably be the best option, but not in MD yet.</li><li>1x Barrone de Fleur just because we have a tuner and could occasionally summon it. Entirely replacable.</li><li>1x Linguriboh as my out to Iblee, as otherwise this deck would simply keel over on the spot if Iblee is summoned. Also replacable, we're not in an Iblee meta right now so it doesn't matter that much, but I had the space and noticed the weakness so I corrected.</li></ul><p>And that's the list. As always, feel free to ask questions, I'll try to answer to the best of my ability. Goal is generally to just turbo out Alba Zoa as quickly as possible and then do other shit from there with the rest of your hand hoping that your opponent doesn't have an immediate out to Alba Zoa.</p>"

Lady of Lament Visas (I guess...),"<p><span><strong>Loka Samsara</strong> is a new card coming out in AGOV and with it being able to Summon a Visas counterpart from your Extra Deck, it gives you a lot of utility considering the monsters you can summon off of it.&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart&nbsp;</strong>shuffles a card your opponent controls into the Deck,&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Arise-Heart </strong>is just <strong>Macro Cosmos</strong>, and <strong>Scareclaw Tri-Heart </strong>changes all monsters to Defense and is unaffected by Defense Position monsters (let's pretend that Prime-Heart doesn't exist). However, the catch is that you need to banish a&nbsp;<strong>Visas Starfrost</strong> you control to activate it. My first idea to use the card is in Lady of Lament to easily search it while summoning Visas off of <strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> because you rarely go into the Extra Deck turn 1 and since the DARK Fiends allow you to hard summon Visas from hand also.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For monsters we have 3&nbsp;<strong>Lord of the Heavenly Prison</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Visas Starfrost</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Tour Guide from the Underworld</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Sangan</strong>. To supplement the fact that all of the Visas counterparts in the Extra Deck are DARK monsters, we are playing Virus Traps to get more value off of them before they are eventually banished face-down during the End Phase from Loka Samsara. This is also why we are playing Darkest Diabolos to have a large, recurring, untargetable body on the field. I'm choosing Sangan over Doomdog Octhros because we are running triple Fusion Deployment and we can also choose to Fusion Deployment revealing Sanwitch for Sangan to search follow-up.</span></p><p><span>For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Fusion Deployment</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong>. Only 2&nbsp;<strong>Loka Samsara&nbsp;</strong>since it needs to banish a face-up&nbsp;<strong>Visas Starfrost</strong> you control to activate. This means that if you draw multiple copies of this card with no ways to access Visas, you have a literal dead card in&nbsp; your hand. Also, because it can add itself back to hand from GY when your opponent summons from the Extra Deck, you really do not need 3 of it in Deck unless you want to reliably search it off of Lilith. However, you still need Visas on field to do anything with it. 2&nbsp;<strong>Eradicator Epidemic Virus</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Deck Devastation Virus</strong> since all of the Visas Extra Deck monsters are DARK, so they make for good Virus fodder before they eventually banish themselves face-down during the End Phase. 1&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, 3 <strong>Archfiend's Ghastly Glitch</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Anti-Spell Fragrance</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Vicious Astraloud</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Kashtira Arise-Heart</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Scareclaw Tri-Heart</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Sanwitch</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Elder Entity N'tss</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Mereologic Aggregator</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>EvilTwin's Trouble Sunny</strong>, 1<strong> Dharc the Darck Charmer, Gloomy</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Side Deck is mainly going second stuff along with&nbsp;<strong>Dimensional Barriers</strong> and&nbsp;<strong> Destructive Daruma Karma Cannon</strong>. Looking at Loka Samsara, it is definitely an interesting card, but you cannot get much out of it due to the fact that you need to banish a Visas you control to activate it. Dedicated Trap Decks can play if they run something like Fusion Deployment of some other way to get Visas on the field, but it is still clunky unless you build your whole deck around it. I really doubt that a Mannadium deck would even play it either as you get so much more out of its standard combo already.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

It seems that not much has changed since the last time I appeared but it's fine. Just like this deck there really doesn't to fixate on anything drastic; simply because we aren't getting any new support for neither Tenyi or Swordsoul anytime soon that is game changing or groundbreaking. However what I did notice was that a prominent Synchro Monster just got released from the banlist after half a decade on it. ""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"" was a very impactful synchro monster for it's time: being that it can not only manipulate it's level with whatever monster you mill to the GY, which in case can be any monster that can benefit from being in the GY or have GY effects (such as the Tenyi monsters if a normal monster is on the field). The result of this allows easier access to synchro monsters you normally wouldn't be able to access under the typical Swordsoul-Tenyi playstyle (such as ""Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen"" and ""Psychic End Punisher"").</p>"

Sorry for the late reply, this deck was pretty hard to get a definitive format for since there's a lot of potential for it with many different playstyles. This is my favorite one so far, I will be making adjustments though probably.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: I didnt finish the extra deck bc during research I saw a lot of people running Rank 8 XYZ monsters or Link monsters that have nothing to do with this Archetype, and I was trying to keep it as pure as possible, but still viable. If I were to suggest off-archetype extra deck monsters, it would mainly be Zeus and such high ranking monsters.</p><p>PS: Thanks for the requests, I currently have 2 more requests that I'll be going through with, but feel free to reach out with anything new you might wanna see created.</p>"

Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</em></strong><br /><br />Branded is even stronger than ever before... And now on top of it's new support it has the ridiculously unfair Expulsion Lock! Grab free wins on ladder with this abusive strategy!<br /><br />The ""Expulsion Lock"" summons Gimmick Puppet Nightmare to your opponent's side of the field so they can only special summon that archetype for the rest of the turn! <br /><br />Here is a short step-by-step guide on the combo:</p><p>1. Summon Aluber to search for Branded Fusion.</p><p>2. Activate Branded Fusion to summon Lubellion by sending Albaz + Gimmick Puppet Nightmare to the GY.</p><p>3. Lubellion fusion summons Mirrorjade by shuffling Albaz + Lubellion back into the deck.</p><p>4. Activate Mirrorjade's effect to banish Aluber by sending Albion to the GY.</p><p>5. During the endphase, activate Albion's effect to set Branded Expulsion from deck.</p><p>6. During your opponent's turn (preferably the draw phase) activate Branded Expulsion tributing Mirrorjade. Summon from banished pile Aluber to your field. Summon from GY Gimmick Puppet Nightmare to your opponent's field.</p><p>7. On summon, Aluber searches for your Branded card of choice. Gimmick Puppet Nightmare then activates to lock your opponent out of special summoning except for Gimmick Puppets.</p><p>This particularly nasty combo basically ends your opponent's turn. All they can pretty much do is set backrow and normal summon a monster. Next turn, you should have more than enough follow-up to finish off your opponent! <br /><br />This build has been granting me quick, straightforward and easy freewins on Masterduel ladder. Hope you have as much success as I do!<br /><br />GLHF Duelists!<br /><strong><em><br />Want to see the deck in action?

Vaylantz provide the materials, Solfachord provides the high scale and one of the boss monsters, GranSolfachord Coolia.</p><p>Pros:</p><p>- Vaylantz and Solfachord cards are both super cheap.</p><p>- Vaylantz field spells can turn off cards like Infinite Impermanence, Evenly Matched, Lightning Storm, etc. In fact, opening a field spell isn't that bad, because you can immediately turn off Infinite Impermanence. (try to put Koing Wissen on your field, in case you have to pop it, the opponent is still left with Shinra Bansho on their field).</p><p>- ReSolfachord Dreamia acts as the high scale and allows GranSolfachord Coolia's negate to be live. Dreamia can be searched by Cutia, be set in scale by Elegance (plays around Ash/Veiler, etc), and searched by Beyond the Pendulum (BTP). Ideally, you would have Dreamia before making BTP, so you can search for another Vaylantz monster with BTP.</p><p>- Coolia provides a much needed spell/trap negate (it can negate any card or effect), but it also provides negation protection to your pendulum monsters it points to. It would be best to save Shinonome's effects until she can be protected by Coolia.</p><p>- This deck can pend summon basically whenever it wants, in fact with the right hand it is beneficial to pend summon early to get Coolia out ASAP and then use it to protect your Vaylantz monsters from being negated by ash, gamma, etc.</p><p>- Can probably play Time-Tearing Morganite, if you're into that.</p><p>- Pretty easy to make another BTP if the first one can't resolve (ash, veiler, etc). The restriction only applies if it resolves, and only the second effect is a HOPT.</p><p>Cons:</p><p>- Dies to Anti-Spell Fragrance.</p><p>- Dies to any spell speed 2 or higher spell/trap removal. Using MST, Cosmic Cyclone, Twin Twisters, Solemn Judgement, etc on the field spells, scales, etc. are super effective.</p><p>- Vaylantz can be a little complicated already, but having to leave ReSolfachord Dreamia in the scale so Coolia's negate can be used makes things more complicated (you lose a scale to summon your Vaylantz).</p><p>- Cutia cannot be pend summoned (because the deck plays no 0 scales), can only be normal summoned.</p><p>- Leaving Koning Wissen on the field can be annoying. A tip, however, is that it requires the person using it to have a monster in the same column as the monster they are targeting. So, if you have Arktos XII and weren't able to destroy Konig Wissen in time, you can destroy the opponent's monster before they can activate Konig Wissen (or just destroy Koing Wissen).</p><p>Notes:</p><p>- It is possible to get Coolia's negate live in time for Nibiru, but it can't be used the second you Vaylantz lock yourself. Only useful if your opponent shotguns Nibiru, or they don't understand the interactions between Vaylantz and Solfachord.</p><p>- Genesis Grand Duke is there for situations in which you need an extra material to make Arktos XII (use Voltage Viscount and Shinra Bansho).</p>"

I've played this for over two years in meta now, so it's refined to the best of my ability.</p><p>Well it's focused around heading first, I have different ways to combat and win certain circumstances! Feel free to comment and add suggestions.</p><p>Tactics:</p><p>You're ideal hand will have ""Mantis"", ""Parallel eXceed"", ""Heavenly Prison's, and three hole cards.</p><p>Sera needs to be out first turn, along with some defense using hole cards. If you get ""Rafflesia"" out with Sera you're golden.</p><p>""Sera"" let's you flood both the field with both hole and Traptrix monsters, well ""Rafflesia"" makes sure your Traptrix monsters are not destroyed by battle, card effects, or directly attacked.</p><p>""Heavenly Prison"" makes set cards not be destroy my card effects, perfect to counter brack row breaking spells and traps such as ""Lightning Storm"". He also acts as good 3000 beatstick. To get him in your hand easier, special summon ""Gallant Granite"" with 2 level 4 monsters. As all Traptrix monsters are level 4 and Sera floods the field with them, this is easy.</p><p>Summoning ""Sera"" with ""Parallel eXceed"" allows ""Rafflesia"" to be summoned first turn, as she only needs 2 level 4 monsters.</p><p>For this reason, ""The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine"" also counts as a level four monster. If you get this, summon ""Sera"" before using ""Brigandine"", as activating it's effect will also get you a free Traptrix monster summon.</p><p>As Traptrix isn't very good at high damage, ""Dogmatika Ecclesia"" can summon ""Dogmatika Fleurdelis"" to add some extra power. That, and ""Fleurdelis"" nullify a monsters effect as if ""Ecclesia"" is on the field when summoned. ""Fleurdelis"" can be summoned on either turns Main Phase from your hand if either player special summons from the extra deck.</p><p>If all else fails, you can use ""Dionaea"" to summon a Traptrix Monster from your graveyard, giving you option. You can link into a ""Knightmare"" monster, or summon ""Allomerus"". ""Number 80"" is there to buff ""Allomerus"" if she needs it, but her purpose is to bring out ""ZEUS"". Most games you won't be summoning her if you don't neex ""ZEUS""</p>"

Even through 8 limits and a ban, this deck in my opinion is still an incredibly powerful option and can stand up to the best of the best.&nbsp;</p><p>Some quick explainations:</p><p>This deck wants to mill a lot. For consistency I wanted to balance the deck between cards that are good to draw, and cards that are good to mill. E.g. the tear names are very good to mill, and OK to draw. Danger Nessie is quite good to draw or mill. Diviner is incredible to draw, but not great to mill. This deck tries to find the balance in that and use as many GY effects as possible to go nuts on your first turn. Jet synchron and destrudo are very useful to make Baronne and Dragite. As long as you mill enough cards you should usually put up an insane board that is very hard to push through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

This deck isn't intended to be used competitively since it could definitely use some polishing. I am posting this because I personally believe that this deck is the perfect deck for begginers. It is a really simple deck to learn how to play and, if you remove triple tactics and make small ajustments in the extra deck since not all the monsters are needed, this is a perfect budget deck to pick up the game for the first time.

The new Horus cards, with each of them being an inherent summon from GY if you control&nbsp;<strong>Pharaonic Sarcophagus</strong>, are an incredible Rank 8 engine with their cards being able to easily send all 4 names to GY for enough material for 2 Rank 8 monsters without using your Normal Summon. This deck aims at going second in order to make Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon and its compatriots to steal your opponent's monsters and overlay them into Cipher X Dragons to hopefully deal near-lethal damage to your opponent or prevent them from retaining resources on field and/or in GY.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For our monster handtraps, we have 2&nbsp;<strong>Nibiru, the Primal Being</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</strong>. For our Horus monsters, we have 3&nbsp;<strong>Imsety, Glory of Horus</strong>, and 1 each of the rest: 1&nbsp;<strong>Hapy, Vanguard of Horus</strong>, 1<strong> Qebehsenuef, Aegis of Horus</strong>, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Duamutef, Blessing of Horus</strong>. Functionally, we are only using them for a Rank 8 package, so their individual effects are irrelevant for the most part other than Imsety who can send itself and a card from hand to search&nbsp;<strong>Pharaonic Sarcophagus</strong> to get everything started. You will brick on Horus monsters if you play more than 1 of the other names. For Ciphers, we are playing 3&nbsp;<strong>Cipher Biplane</strong>, 3<strong> Cipher Twin Raptor</strong>, 1<strong> Cipher Mirror Knight</strong>, and 3<strong> Cipher Etranger</strong>. Biplane summons itself if another Cipher is Summoned and it can make 2 Ciphers become Level 8. Raptor is a free summon if your opponent controls a monster summoned from the Extra Deck, and it can discard 1 to summon a Cipher, preferrably Biplane, from Deck. Mirror Knight is just here as discard fodder since it searches a Cipher card during the End Phase of the turn it was sent to the GY. The same goes for Etranger, but it immediately searches a Cipher Spell/Trap when sent to the GY and it can attach itself from hand or GY to a Cipher Xyz Monster.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For Spell/Traps, we have 3&nbsp;<strong>Pharaonic Sarcophagus</strong> which allows you to send a card from hand to send a Horus monster from Deck to GY up to 4 times per turn. Just sending all of the names in a turn gives you a repeatable, recurring Rank 8 package as long as Sarcophagus remains on field. 2&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Thrust</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Triple Tactics Talent</strong>. 3&nbsp;<strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong>. 1&nbsp;<strong>Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Ascension</strong> which is a fun little thing you can do. This ranks up Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon into Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon to steal up to 3 monsters instead of 1. 3<strong> Forbidden Chalice</strong> and 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> because we are going all into this going second thing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For the Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher X Dragon</strong> because it recycles and/or summons back your Dragon Xyz Monsters and you can overlay into it using a monster you stole off of a Cipher Dragon because they are treated as Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon when you do. 1<strong> Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Blade Dragon</strong> which is targeted destruction. 1&nbsp;<strong>Galaxy-Eyes Full armor Photon Dragon</strong> which is also targeted destruction. 3 <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon</strong> as it is your main Rank 8 monster you are going into. 1&nbsp;<strong>Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</strong> as a monster negate to go into going first. 1&nbsp;<strong>Hieratic Sun Dragon Overlord of Heliopolis</strong> which tributes monsters from hand and/or field to destroy cards. If you have an insufficient number of Ciphers in hand, but have all of the Horus monsters in GY already, your hand is just fodder for Heliopolis to destroy cards. 1 <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> which is a Spell Negate going first. 1&nbsp;<strong>Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star </strong>for removal and protection. 1&nbsp;<strong>Divine Dragon Knight Felgrand for</strong> protection and/or a negate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Side Deck isn't much.

With the massive amount of damage + Golem's auto-1000, a optimal field can be extremely dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>Freed/Tomato/Spy act as your monster searchers, allowing you to get though the deck faster as well as stalling Golem if needed. Freed is also suprisingly quite good standalone given his spell immunity and draw effect, making him a issue that typically involves a waste of removal from the opponent. You don't really need to be too worried about general offence given Golem is universal field removal, though the side does consider that as I'll explain.</p><p>Kotetsu lets you get into your equips faster; Snatch Steal and Burial included alongside some beefy equips. 3x Trunade removes the issue of pesky traps alongside freeing the field if equips clog things up.&nbsp;</p><p>Traps are mostly general defence with a couple of extra burn stables thrown in in case of needing that little bit extra damage required if needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Game 2 changes things up by going into Panda Burn: almost always throws the opponent for a loop given the general long-game nature of the Golem strat, but it's a perfect fit for here so it doesn't harm the deck much. Wok helps for burn mirror and Kycoo/Big Bang/Nobleman help for Chaos variations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

What's that?,"<p>There's a couple of Ancient Gear builds already that are great, but I figured this version is pretty good as well.</p><p>Beast is unironically one of the most underrated cards around. Complete shutdown of backrow if it attacks, negates anything that is destroyed: not just flip effects, but anything that pops in the graveyard, so recruiters also get the boot as well. Combined with Cost Down making it a level 4, it is easily splashable and shuts down a lot of conventional plays. Your opponent has to either waste non-battle removal on it or try to play over with monsters. Golem is impossible to get out normally but with Cost it becomes a single tribute, which is amazing given how much damage it can do with just a single reliable attack on a unsuspecting token or facedown play. Jinzo is a solid play as well.&nbsp;</p><p>To aid with this I threw in the regular Monarch Soul Control engine just in case Cost isn't available + removal alongside some basic Earth recruiters that can either be removal-bait, used for field control or just there to hold the fort. Gigantes is a great combo given it's essentially a free summon so it can be used to swarm the field for big damage or splashed into a tribute. Sangan/Serpent are there for easy discard/consistency fodder alongside Exiled/Lady alongside Reinforcement for more Gigantes fodder + removal if required.</p><p>Book of Moon is there just mostly for tech purposes and we have 1 Limiter to beef up any Golem + Jinzo for a big charge.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the need to protect monsters I didn't really bother with traps bar three Decree to shutdown backrow disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck is pretty generalised. Threw in a standard Chaos build just to have more stuff for Cost to burn though, Wombat + Wok for burn, Trunade for safe charges against more proactive fields and Stein in case of needing big monsters on the fly. Meta combos well with your Golems if you want more flexiablity and Forbidden is mostly to counter ReasoningGate plays if required given their speed can be a issue for the deck (alongside Golems not being able to be special summoned).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

No one has really gone overboard and went into the terrible concept of a proper Goblin deck, but it actually turned out pretty decent. The Deck generally tries to control the field with big ATK values and useful backrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Goblin/Toon Goblin Attack Force are the core of the deck. Huge stats, basically are a wall to get past. The great thing about Goblins is that they have amazing consistency and search power, with both reinforcement and Toon Table being able to get them out. If you just run with a single 3x Table into Goblin, that's already a 36 card deck essentially. Gorilla is a solid beatdown alternative alongside stables like Gigantes and Exiled. Panda is obviously great, no need to detail further.</p><p>Usual basic spell set, including Trunade and Nobleman to establish control quickly. If you play a Goblin turn 1 the opponent generally always goes for a facedown play, so this is a easy set-up.&nbsp;</p><p>Traps focus around the main weakness of the deck: Goblins not being able to attack more than once without a cooldown. Skill Drain removes that issue and cripples the opponent alongside Final Attack, turning any monster play by the opponent into a dangerous investment and outright nearly destroying Scapegoat plays by itself. Deck generally doesn't have many issues with Goat Control given what's on board here. Solemn + Comp are useful for getting rid of problematic cards, Ring is especially useful with such beefy targets to boot.</p><p>Side is...mostly just the basic plays against Warrior/Chaos/Burn. Trio + Final Attack or Panda can be a useful alternative way to stack up damage. Kaiser is fairly underrated and keeps more swarm-heavy builds under check immediately, can bait out removals because of how annoying it can be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Because of the meta of this, your opponent will almost always call a high number to counter the impending Crane/Dark Magician/beefy monster, but instead you are likely to draw a Exodia piece instead. The point of the deck is that this is great, because that means a free tribute or being able to snatch it up when it is in the grave with your numerous recovery tools.</p><p>Jinzo and Horus are also used to confuse the opponent further when they either call low or a higher number, not to mention Horus LV8 is a amazing boss monster that shuts down half of the important cards in the set.

This is also great, because we will be instead be playing Chaos Control, blindsiding them again with a classic smokescreen.

No problem,"<p>This is a pretty simple build: it's all focused around normal monsters with high statlines running over everything. Backrow helps with controlling the field and keeping threats in check.</p><p>Heart is insanely good for consistency; it makes you able to draw into all of your plays so much quicker, especially with two. Alongside Trinity and the rest of the stables we have 3x Kaiser. I debate having 2 instead, but Kaiser is just so good that it's not even funny. As soon as this is on the field Scapegoat is useless, any deck that spams monsters is useless, Chaos is shut down for the most part, etc. It's so oppressive and it forces your opponent to either waste removal or try to play around it with big monsters, both playing to the style this deck works at.&nbsp;</p><p>Order to Charge doesn't seem great, but having a Quick Play instant monster removal is amazing, actually. If you run into a battle trap you can chain this and destroy something anyway, wasting the trap in the process, anything that targets like soul exchange or brain control for Monarchs is also countered as long as you have a opposing monster to handle. You always have a way to get rid of stuff or make sure it can't go off proper, especially alongside three Solemn and three Saku. Your opponent will be playing Nobleman and that's a instant waste given this deck should never be setting anything apart from backrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Sides are mostly either Chaos counters or more removal options. I included Non-Spellcasting as it's actually pretty nutty for support, giving you full-on immunity to all spell cards: not targeting, not destroying, full on immunity. This makes Soul Control Monarchs automatically just suck ass as all of their stealing tech is disabled, Moon is disabled, Snatch is disabled, hell any attempt to use spells on your monsters will simply not work.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously this isn't meta in the slightest, but you'd be surprised how much trouble this deck can give to some of the better stuff out there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I say who cares about those. I love Orcust so I wanted to shove these 2 decks I like into this, (admittedly not as strong as Ishizu Tear), deck. I have tons of fun with this deck, and vastly prefer is over any other Tear variant.&nbsp;</p><p>This deck is capable of consistently ending on Galatea with Crescendo Set, Redoer, and Rulkallos. Being able to pitch any Orcust card in hand with Scheiren allows you to be able to set up your grave for Orcust plays, as well as unbrick your hand for when World Wand decides to show up. I run Armageddon Knight in this deck over the 2nd copy of Girsu as he is capable of starting both Tear plays and Orcust plays depending on what you already have on board/in grave. With Poly you are capable of fusing any Tear name with any Orcust name to create Mudragon, triggering the Tear cards effects as well as gaining targetting protection/going straight into Dragostapelia</p><p>.Abyss Dweller is a card that honestly rarely comes up. It is sort of hard to get 2 level 4's on field before dark locking yourself with the Orcust effects, so you may cut it if you want. Due to Babel's effect of constaly recycling itself, milling it is not an issue, as well as replacing it on field for Planet. I;P also may be changed out for Dharc, I simply like being able to go into Unicorn on my opponents turn.</p><p>Bystials/Evenly Matched/Imperm ratios can all be changed around depending on preference.&nbsp;</p>"

The effect of raising the attack above the 3000 threshold AND making it unaffected by monster effects after that is a god-send, not to mention the once-per-turn spell/trap negate and on-death searching effect. Better still, you can pull this off easily with Red-Eyed Dice and a non-tuner Speedroid monster.

As you can see, the gameplan is pretty simple: lots of stat-heavy monsters, dump them away with removal then rush in with Strike Ninja for big aggressive plays.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite me being worried that this would brick given the amount of ""can't be Normal Summoned"" cards here it suprisingly has been pretty robust in playtesting, only having the occasional slightly bad draw. Trunade and other powerful backrow options keep the backrow in check to protect yourself while aiding that eventual OTK strat down the line. The deck isn't really built to grind, it's built to just last long enough to make a competent charge.</p><p>Side-deck is mostly counters to warriors alongside Cold Wave and Fragrance to stop spell-heavy/similarly aggressive decks. Return is useful as a less impressive Fusion but can definitely aid in a clinch, especially given it unlike Fusion banishes everything back again so you don't have to worry about rebuilding your field.&nbsp;</p><p>The Magician cards are there to run though the deck alongside a potential 500+ boost to all DARK monsters, which in the long run can actually be a substantual play given the strength of your big Ninja plays.&nbsp;</p>"

We work machines for this purpose, namely aggressive stat-heavy ones that can be brought out relatively easy, but is also assisted with some monster stealing. Moon techs with Fusilier to get it to full stats, Fate/Kote help with consistency and regaining useful cards. Stein is here for quick and easy access to big monsters and Roulette Barrel can basically be sat on if required.&nbsp;</p><p>Burrower combos with Nitro to add even more damage to the mix with its underrated level-based burn effect.

Pineapple is certainly....weird for tech, but it worked here given it hard-counters a Scapegoat field or any monster-heavy lineup with only a single summon.&nbsp;</p><p>I was prepared to work the side deck as usual until I noticed that nearly all of the big plays here are Dark monsters, so...I just side-decked a mini-Ninja Return package to capitalise on that alongside some general cost-cards to work towards that specific goal.

Dogmatika,"<p>The Charmers are a fan favourite archetype of cute girls (and a sad boy), that originated in early ygo as FLIP monsters that can take control of a monster your opponent control with their same original Attribute. Over time they have gotten more support that has made them usable, but not viable. The Charmers' Familiars recieved upgrades as well, becoming excellent extenders while you control a Spellcaster monster. One stellar piece they recieved was Eda the Sun Magician, which Special Summons a Spellcaster with 1500 DEF, such as a Charmer, from your Deck in face-down Defense Position. It can also flip up a face-down Spellcaster you control during your opponent's turn at Quick Effect speed.</p><p>Combine all this with the powerful Dogmatika Engine, which provides further extension, disruption, and utility, which makes this deck much more competitive, but nowhere near tiered status.</p><p>If you want to play the Shaddoll Engine, you can easily exchange a few cards out for it, and you'd probably want to add another Maximus too.</p>"

This card allows you to set 2 Crystal Beasts from your Deck as face-up Continuous Spells, then Special Summon 1 Crystal Beast monster from your hand with a different name from the cards you placed. Notice how the 2 you set from the Deck can be the same name. So what you can do is set 2 Sapphire Pegasus from your Deck, and Special Summon Ruby Carbuncle from hand, and Summon the 2 Pegasus from your Spell &amp; Trap Zone to set other Crystal Beasts from your Deck.</p><p>This archetype has become easily able to make Rank 4s, most popularly ""Time Thief Redoer"" and ""Lightning Chidori"", but due to the Crystal Beast monsters staying the Spell &amp; Trap Zone instead of the GY, the deck is easily able to utilize the infamous Dimension Shifter and Dimensional Fissure.

While the architype is surely quite well known in Goat Format, it's had almost zero major success as a competently strong deck (other than some relatively minor early victories) despite being a direct counter to Chaos builds; you usually only see Necrovalley used in some side-decks if need be as a tech at best. You see Spy a lot as well however as either a wall and/or in slower Chaos variations.</p><p>This attempts to reform them by pairing them up with Anti-Meta/Toolbox Warrior for adjustable plays alongside aggressive backrow removal and 3x Dustshoot to fully control the field and hand. As you can tell it's mostly based around handling the Chaos meta, which it seems to be fairly successful at. Side-deck functions with even more tech to throw in including more backrow removal, Monarch plays and even King Tiger to disable Panda Burn strats. It's a pretty simple but extremely effective deck at doing what it does.&nbsp;</p>"

His stats are decent for the time, he's splashable in beast decks, and his effect is crippling for many decks as he can snatch up their monsters when they are destroyed, meaning Chaos builds lose their typically splashable fodder for their bigger plays, most conventional meta builds can suffer if their combo pieces are missing, and any general flip monster can be stolen and then used by us via Book of Moon to turn their effects against them. It's a really great effect, especially when considering almost every major deck uses the Graveyard for multiple plays.</p><p>To help with the current meta of heavy backrow, we use Decree to disable general traps alongside Warwolf/Breaker and Jinzo. Equip cards like United or Baou either make our Jackal more beefy or bypass dangerous flip effects. Removal like Smashing/Vortex/Nobleman provide great coverage for threats that our high-stat beasts might have issues with.</p><p>Battle Ox gives our Jackal plays more oomf with additional piercing damage to boot, and Nimble is useful for baiting out removal or to establish field presence. Wild Nature is generally not played in Beastdown/beatdown decks due to most staple monsters having low DEF: a extra 600 or so isn't going to help much. Jackal has 1600, which combined with his already decent stats makes him a 3000+ wrecking ball that can run over practially everything. We can also use Moon to bypass the destruction effect if need be. My Body as a Shield helps with field nukes and/or attempts to clean the field nicely.</p><p>Finally we have conventional cards like D.D. Assailant and Reaper; mostly here just to stall potential plays out if required but can be used aggressively as well. The side deck is focused around specific counters (Asura/Panda/Controller for Goat Control, Wombat/Wok for burn, etc) additional tech like Manticore as a alternative boss monster or Trunade to further wipe out backrow troubles. Easy done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Unlike in Edison a Monster Mash deck is significantly harder to do just due to the insanely good spells and traps you are inhertently missing out in. The point of Monster Mash is that you ONLY play monsters, so obviously Chaos is the best archetype to go though. This is my most conservative attempt at making it at least semi-playable, playing it safe if you will.</p><p>One great thing about this deck is the sheer amount of plays here: you have tons of draw power, big monster potential, tons of recruiters, etc etc. Monster Mash means you will always draw a hand of good to great monsters while your opponent will draw maybe a few with spells and traps.</p><p>So.....how do we deal with that? Mirage Dragon helps a ton, as does the usual destruction you'd expect from a Chaos deck. You have so much to use here that backrow will usually not be enough to hold back all of it, especially combined with endless recruiter spam + eventual Chaos staples getting rid of cards, controlling the field, etc. Consistency is easy with the deck....well about as much without any spells, anyway. Everything draws or establishes advantage in different manners. Even silly stuff like the one Stein can go into shutdown or aid with aggressive pushes well. Maruading Captain helps cheat out out plays. Zombie engine is still one of the best plays even with no spells or recovery so it was a no brainer to stick on as well.</p><p>Jars are AMAZING in this deck. Unlike in conventional decks where this would hurt if you were saving up a certain spell or trap when it pops, it means nothing to you here, just a reason to fill up the Grave with Chaos fodder and stuff you don't need. Cyber Jar gives you a entire field to play around with while your opponent will at best get 2/3. Protector + Jars is a cool combo as well if you can pull it off.</p><p>Flip effects keep your opponent on your toes and will probably waste Noblemen given the sheer volume of recruiter fodder mixed in.&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck is mostly if you need to push more aggressively. Theban is weird, but having a 3000 beatstick is worth it for the quality this deck has. Magician combo is more consistency and you can work Creator tech if you need to recycle monsters + get more LIGHT monsters for Chaos. I'll be tinkering around with Mash more with variations (Megarock maybe???) which may or may not be better. It's a step to something, at least.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I encourage you all to play around with card choices / ratios / rules and let me know what you think / develop it further yourselves if you so desire.</p><p>I have looked into Diamond Dude as another really interesting card for the format - just requires some more normal spells to be used more consistently, it certainly benefits from stacking. Duality looked neat, but it was basically free card draw, although at the cost of using Treeborn which is neat. Ancient Telescope could also be a neat card - but rules about public information would have to be refined to ensure that this format's whole thing of best possible play with maximum information is maintained.</p><p><em>This format cannot really be played via any simulators, automated at least. Would recommend that if you do play - do so IRL (Dueling Book would be a real hassle for this), and make sure to take a look at my ratios at the bottom / mess around with the deck / rules for yourself.</em></p><hr /><h2><strong>Card Choice Explanations</strong></h2><ul><li>Raiza the Storm Monarch | Raiza is meant to be both a removal option, and the only real means of damage in the format. Raiza is your main tribute / body outlet with the Treeborn frog in circulation. Raiza allows you to stack the deck in your favour / your opponents [opposite of favour], just like other cards in the format, but also allows for removal of monsters such as Ghost Belle or a Treeborn Frog on the field via battle, either removing them from the game, setting up plays with Treeborn, or putting something into the GY for Cyber Valley to recycle. It takes four hits from Raiza to close out the game, 8000 &gt; 5600 &gt; 3200 &gt; 800 &gt; 0, with ample opportunities for counter-play, either with another Raiza, or Back to Square One / Phoenix Wing Wind Blast.</li><li>Treeborn Frog | Essential card for this format. With one GY, this card is basically exchanged each turn - meaning if you tribute it off on your side for a Raiza, suddenly your opponent has both free defense, and tribute fodder that next turn. Removal of TF from the GY means both players suddenly lose a resource, emphasising smart timing and careful planning / strategy. TF has multiple options of removal from the GY as discussed later on - all which play into this strategic resource loop between players. Treeborn's 100 ATK / DEF means it cannot get over itself, a set D.D Crow, or a Ghost Belle (in which case you would take damage).</li><li>Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion | One of the two hand traps in this format, Ghost Belle is a means to stop a Treeborn from going off, negate a D.D. Crow or Called By The Grave use, or rendering Cyber Valley a trade for normal summon Treeborn. Ghost Belle's 1800 DEF makes it the only real defensive body of the format that ALSO deals damage, pushing your opponent over that 800LP margin and opening them up for game in only three hits with Raiza. Ghost Belle can in turn be negated by Called By The Grave.</li><li>D.D. Crow | Crow is basically Ghost Belle but it can be used in a more interesting scenario - banishing a TF after you have just used it, taking it out of the game for your opponent. Crow can thus also stop a TF, or even mess up a Cyber Valley. Crow, as a handtrap, can thus also lose to Clled By.</li><li>Cyber Valley | Cyber Valley is one of the most premium resources here, offering real versatility in use. It can be a way to delay the game from a loss, a way to draw into whatever you just stacked, or a way to recycle cards your opponent or yourself have used to either give them a poor draw, or give you something quite useful later down the track. Valley is the only card draw in this format, and thus costs between itself as a body, or another monster, for you to gain that card draw - requiring some degree of pre-planning to use it.</li><li>Back to Square One / Phoenix Wing Wind Blast | A normal spell and a trap, respectively, which both allow for a discard and a stack of the deck. This either means removal in the case of Wind Blast, or removal / stacking of any monster via Square. Wind Blast has the trade-off of having to wait a turn, but allows for greater versatility in the form of removing your opponent's spells / traps in addition to monsters, although losing the ability to stack your cards onto the deck. Thus, Wind Blast's only out other than Raiza, is itself, turning it into a card with a lot of weight on its shoulders and a degree of risk. Both of these cards, requiring a discard, can thus also put Treeborn Frog into rotation. Wind Blast can thus ensure you get its first revival - sending TF on your opponent's turn, awaiting your standby phase. Back to Square One requires you have some kind of negation such as Ghost Belle to ensure that your opponent cannot make use of it during their standby phase after you sent it.</li><li>Spellbook Organization / Fruits of Kozaky's Studies | Basically the same card, but required. Both of these cards allow for either counterplay to deck stacking, either giving you a draw you stacked further down, bricking your opponent, preventing your opponent from getting something they stacked, or preventing your opponent from bricking you. Nothing much else of note, they do not achieve card advantage, but they do allow for more stacking strategy.</li><li>Called By The Grave | This is your out to Cyber Valley, Treeborn Frog, Raiza, and Ghost Belle all in one. It does thus come at the cost of stopping you from using those cards that turn, the hand traps in particular, but it allows you to either insulate your plays, stop your opponent from interrupting your plays, preventing a Treeborn Frog from going off, or acting as basically a free negate. Called By's banish also means that anything banished, either a Treeborn Frog or anything Cyber Valley may want to stack, are no longer in the game - gone, banished, exiled, zero'd, thus also requiring smart use, or you may be putting yourself at risk. Called By in of itself loses to Ghost Belle.</li></ul><hr /><h2><strong>Correct Ratios (due to YGOPRODECK limitations)</strong></h2><p>Due to YGOPRODECK's limitations, the ratios I have built the deck with are not displayed.

Engage and Multirole are fresh off the limited list, so yeah. This deck's gonna make a huge comeback, all due to the fact that it's getting new cards and an alt-art printing in Monstrous Revenge. Thanks, capitalism! Imagine the emotional damage this deck would do with Triple Tactics Thrust. There's plenty of flexy space for handtraps with some easy choices to replace, but I don't like being that meta, so you can figure it out on your own.</p><p>Camellia isn't out in the TCG yet, so sub her with a second Zeke. I maxed on Roze because Azalea, the new link that is out, requires 2 light/dark monsters to summon. I prefer her removal to Zeke's because she can target and destroy any card on summon and has non-targeting battle phase destruction. It seems to me that with the new main deck monsters, none of which are light/dark, you can either use their effects or quick-play spells on your opponent's turn, but not both until the monsters are gone. Flexibility, I guess, though I wish they'd written a way around it for the monsters since using them could technically slow the deck down. It's worth noting that even if you give control of Ciela to your opponent, her GY effect will activate for you. Akash gives battle protection and is a decent body to camp on the board.

The scapegoat engine is a favorite of mine in kozmo, with some stuff you can make with them in the Extra Deck, and as a stalling measure if your float gets negated. Ghost Mourner is useless in this format; use veilers and crows. Some decent options for alternative cards based on taste in the side.</p>"

Utopia Prime,"<p>Another casual deck to play with. Here is how to OTK:</p><p>- Draw with Treasure Panda and Saryuja until you get combo pieces.</p><p>- Combo-I: Either reduce your health by half via Cybernetic Fusion Support or increase your opponent's health via Upstart Goblin. Difference must be 3000 to execute the combo.</p><p>- Combo-II: Special Summon another level 4 monster alongside Treasure Panda via Saryuja.</p><p>- Combo-III: XYZ summon Number 39: Utopia &gt;&gt;&gt; Number S39: Utopia Prime.</p><p>- Combo-IV: Give your opponent a minion to activate Utopia Prime's ability via Shien's Spy. Then, trigger Utopia Prime to reduce your health.</p><p>- Combo-V: A Feather of Phoenix &gt;&gt;&gt; Put Spell/Monster card on top of deck &gt;&gt;&gt; Set Fuhma Shuriken &gt;&gt;&gt; Reversal Quiz &gt;&gt;&gt; Choose correct answer! &gt;&gt;&gt; KO!!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some budget tips if you want to save SR or UR:</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" can be unlocked through ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" isn't really needed, if you are low on SR. Though it can be unlocked by opening ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack, Saryuja and other Link monsters can pick targets to refill GY for ""Pot of Avarice"" more than enough. 90 SR saved!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" and ""Number 39: Utopia"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR + 30 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Link Spider"", ""Link Bound"" and LAN are given for free, if you've picked ""Link Generation"". Thus, 90 SR is saved!</p><p>- ""Reversal Quiz"" and ""Number S39: Utopia Prime"" can be found from ""Legacy Pack"". Hope you were lucky to get these for free to save 60 SR.</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be unlocked through timed selection pack called ""The Synchronized Cosmoc"". As of this writing, if you are willing to spend gems to save 30 UR, this is your chance.</p><p>- ""Moray of Greed"" can be a good and cheap alternative for drawing cards. 2xExodia+5x1*-Water or 3xExodia+4x1*-Water are perfect formulae for this card without making Wand and Spellbook cards redundant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 60 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this deck. Thanks for reading, feel free to ask anything. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Deck runs a mini Soul Control package to help tributes run faster, but is more biased towards Brain Control so you can actually use Maju for plays. Big Bang works well with the deck as you can equip it to basically any big monster for punishing attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Royal Command is fairly unused in some circles but it's great here as a universal method of dealing with flip plays when running over stuff rather than using purely Nobleman and praying for the best. Most of the deck otherwise is typical staple cards alongside stuff like Trunade and My Body to make plays more accessible.&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck focuses on a wide assortment of plays including Monarchs, more flip counters, Oppression, Judgement, and even a copy of Deck Devastation that goes well with letting Maju do something beyond being big. It doesn't save this deck from being fairly exposed, but hey, that's what a deck like this has to suffer with in order to be workable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Wattuna is effectively a 2-card combo. You attack with your other level 4 Watt first, then summon it from hand to attack again, then special summon Wattaurus using Tuna and another one from your hand (this is important), then after Wattaurus attacks, shuffle Tuna from gy and 1 Watt you control (has to be 1 you control) into the deck to special summon any other Watt synchro regardless of level except Taurus. If this goes uninterrupted, you're looking at 4800-5100 damage minimum, depending on what other monsters you summon. And that's before buffs, which cards like Hip Hoshiningen and Galaxy Photon Dragon give to light monsters, like all Watts.</p><p>I filled the extra and side decks with other crap to try and turn the game in Watts' favor, because they still need to reach the battle phase before they can lock the opponent. Wattkingdom cancels opponents' summon effects in the same column, and that stacks with each copy and Watt monster on the field. It also finally gives us a way to summon more than one Watt on the first turn without having to wait for that Wattrain in your gy, meaning we can now do extra deck plays. You'll probably want to do that after the battle phase, though. Like summoning Bagooska after smackin' your opponent. Imagine opening a hand with 3 Wattkingdoms and a Watt monster. Your opponent gets to do nothing on summon without that limited Harpie's Feather Duster.</p><p>3 popular cards you should absolutely never use with Watts are Evilswarm Exciton Knight, Dark Ruler No More, and Evenly Matched. This deck needs to deal damage in the battle phase, which all 3 of those prevent. I know your opponent can put up big, daunting boards with their meta wombo-combo deck and you wanna get rid of them, but firstly, without Exciton, these monsters can't remove anything permanently, and secondly, you sacrifice your one win condition to clear their field once and then get blasted next turn. So be smart, and don't do that.</p>"

With etude of the branded you kind of end up with a mini macrocosmo which is really nice for shutting out your opponents ability to recycle their monsters from the graveyard. The last thing I'd need to play around with is removing ""Golden Cloud Beast - Malong"" and potentially adding in another Luluwalilith, but I do enjoy tripping people up with the spin from a supprise Granguignol, so the GCB-M spot can realistically be replaced with any anything you'd want. Thanks :) Hope you enjoy the profile.</p>"

This is done by stacking the deck full of rock monsters, having them be milled by the Jars/Merchant before then making a Megarock (s) and using the ever broken Dimensional Fusion to take full presence and run things over.</p><p>The monster lineup is pretty much ALL of the rock monsters....the good ones, at least. Golem Sentry is a low-key MVP that enables solid stall play while being a effective counter to opposing flip monsters or big beaters, being able to waste Noblemen slots on it while not being too much of a loss to your gameplan overall. Alongside Stone Statue's huge wall-like DEF stats and double damage, this typically gets you that early advantage to work off while setting up your stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Gigantes and Rock Spirit are also used given we can still use our rock resources to make similarly big monsters to establish aggro presence, not to mention they just get added to the pile as well as a 1/1. Granmarg is objectively the worst Monarch but can be still very useful as our alt-removal tech and primary target for Fusion to bring back given his big stats. Everything else is interchangable: some deck versions use more copies of Maharaghi or Elephant but I just couldn't see much of a use for them that aids the deck much for the big plays.</p><p>Spells are the usual lot minus Duo as we need the life points + there's not really a need for it in the deck, especially when most Chaos decks benefit from having stuff in the graveyard anyway. Card Destruction/Trunade allow huge presence regardless that controls the field more reliably. Rivalry especially is quite useful, especially when dealing with stuff like Panda Burn/more varied deck lots.&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck works some typical popular format counters alongside working more of a PACMAN strat with Medusa Worm and co. Big Shield is a good 1 of tech that can fake out a nobleman play and get in extra damage. Sphinx is amazing regardless of the deck, and Lost Guardian is a weird nerfed Gran Maju that could maybe snatch a win or two from a opponent playing sloppy and charging into it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

So if we put two and two together, we get this Lady of Lament Assault Mode Deck, if you can even call it a Deck.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For the Lady of Lament part of the Deck, we are playing the usual 3&nbsp;<strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Alice, Lady of Lament</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Sangan</strong>, and 2&nbsp;<strong>Tour Guide from the Underworld.</strong> For the Assault Mode part of the Deck, 2<strong> Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Assault Sniper</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Assault Beast</strong>, and 3<strong> Psi-Reflector</strong>. Stardust Assault Mode is probably the best Assault Mode option aside from Red Dragon Archfiend Assault Mode since its effect is reactive and it floats into something that is also reactive. RDA Assault Mode is probably the next best option due to your Extra Deck options for RDA like Scarlight whose name becomes RDA on field and in GY so RDA Assault Mode can be made with it and float back into it, but the Assault Mode's effect is after it attacked anyways which is slow and not as worth it. Assault Sniper is basically your access to Psi-Reflector not given E-tele and it allows you to just sit on Assault Mode Stardust with a bunch of backrow in the event you don't draw any Lady of Laments. Assault Beast and Psi-Reflector are just the usual Assault Mode package.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For Spell/Traps: 3&nbsp;<strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong> (This isn't necessary, but it is nice if you want to see both halves of your Deck), 3&nbsp;<strong>Ties of the Brethren</strong>, 3<strong> Emergency Teleport</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Dogmatika Punishment</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Trap Trick</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Assault Mode Activate</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Red Reign</strong>, 3&nbsp;<strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong>, and 3&nbsp;<strong>Solemn Strike</strong>. Assault Mode Activate is very searchable already and having more than 1 in hand and/or on field is not necessary as you will probably be sitting on an Assault Mode already from your 1 Assault Mode Activate you searched. Red Reign is an interesting removal option which banishes all other monsters on the field other than the monster with the highest Level if you control a Level 8 or higher Synchro. This can be a removal option before you go into Stardust Assault Mode as it only banishes other monsters and not backrow, so you still have all of your Traps to support you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For the Extra Deck: 1&nbsp;<strong>Garura, Wings of Resonant Life</strong> for a draw when sent to the GY, 2&nbsp;<strong>N'tss</strong> for a pop when sent to the GY, 2&nbsp;<strong>Stardust Dragon</strong> for the Assault Mode stuff and because we can technically make more than 1 throughout the game, 1<strong> Golden Cloud Beast - Malong</strong> which is a bounce when sent to the GY, 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>D/D/D Stone King Darius</strong> for an Xyz body to make, 1&nbsp;<strong>The Phantom Knights of Break Sword</strong> for removal<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>1 <strong>Number 49: Fortune Tune</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Tri-Brigade Arms Bucephalus II</strong> for a larger body to send off of Punishment which sends a Beast, Winged Beast or Beast Warrior in return like Garura, 1&nbsp;<strong>Evil Twins Trouble Sunny</strong> for an Ultimate Slayer target, 1&nbsp;<strong>Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Paleozoic Cambroraster</strong> for backrow protection, and 1<strong> Salamangreat Almiraj</strong>.</span></p><p><span>Side Deck isn't much. 1<strong> Evil Twins Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la</strong> to send off of Trouble Sunny, 3&nbsp;<strong>Alpha, the Master of Beasts</strong> and 1&nbsp;<strong>Dinowrestler Pankratops&nbsp;</strong>for removal, 3&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Slayer</strong>, 1&nbsp;<strong>Destructive Daruma Karma Cannon</strong>, 3 <strong>Evenly Matched</strong>, 2&nbsp;<strong>Starlight Road</strong> as we are playing Stardust Dragon, and 1&nbsp;<strong>Transaction Rollback</strong> as a cute tech option.</span></p><p><span>You can play&nbsp;<strong>Assault Reboot</strong> in this Deck as it is also a Normal Trap, but it requires you to play another brick in another Assault Mode name. The next best 1 you could go into for interruption is&nbsp;<strong>T.G.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Halberd Cannon/Assault Mode</strong> as it negates a Summon and banishes all Special Summoned monsters your opponent controls and it floats into the normal Halberd Cannon which does the same thing. However, Assault Reboot must summon from Deck and it is impossible to hard summon the normal Halberd Cannon. The Assault Mode does float into it from GY ignoring its Summoning conditions which means you can send it from ED with Punishment, but it just isn't worth it.&nbsp;</span></p>"

The greatest strength of Melffies is...their friendship and ability to work together! Because that gives them access to more boss monsters than any other deck I've built! So let's get into it.</p><p>You've got the obvious 3-ofs, Puppy, Catty, Pinny, then 1 of the rest because they're all searchable and do things Melffies need. Wally's at 1 because you only need to trigger her once. Rabby, as cute as he is, is sadly unplayable. Fortunately, the devs kept him relevant by featuring his adorable face on Staring Contest, which is a good mulligan card and permanently nerfs the monsters your opponent currently controls. Kalantosa gets kinda bricky if you have too many, but he's not even soft once per turn, so 2 is perfect, especially if you open with one and that 1 Fenny in hand.</p><p>There's a small danger package for removal/free summons because Melffies struggle to do all that on your turn. White Steed helps you build Dragite, which tops off this deck's negation alongside Herald of Arc Light, Apollousa, Impermanence, and Melffy of the Forest. Kerass is a ss that helps you xyz or link. Nimble Beaver's your primary ns target. No Rescue Cat because that thing is so handtrap prone that it is dead weight, and unlike Beaver, leaves you with nothing on the board. You also can't xyz or synchro with it. Because Melffies don't deal big damage on their first turn, you're totally safe skipping your battle phase with Evenly Matched before you build a big invincible board to smash 8000-0 next turn. I've done it more than once.</p><p>I:P Masquerena is especially great for these little beasties because they summon on opponent's turn, so after you've gone through Kalantosa, link with her. Knightmare Unicorn's your option if you couldn't field anything else. If you get 4 monsters, you can go into Apollousa or Underworld Goddess (with Goddess' effect, they technically use the same amount). Summon whatever's best for what you're facing. Masquerena cannot summon Tri-Brigades, though. That will have to be on your turn, but Shuraig can banish on your opponent's turn when your Melffies summon.</p><p>You may have noticed a peculiar pick that isn't any kind of beast in this deck. This is my most recent inclusion. I added Icejade Ran Aegirine because this deck has searchable water monsters, and Ran is a free Gymir summon. Previously, I had to get one of the lvl 8 Dangers or Alpha and make it with Pinny, but now I can just discard Pinny instead. Having Gymir on the field pretty much guarantees my victory. Unless you DRNM her, there's virtually no way around because she can trigger on anything, and if you chain her, she removes that, too. And if your opponent likes to banish, she comes back. Swordsoul Chengying is just an additional target for the Ran playset. The only downside to running her is you have to hard draw her, but even if you open on all 3 copies, that's not a total brick because you can also discard a copy of her for her effect. 1 Gymir is WAY better than 1 anything else.</p>"

Neko+Slifer+Panda,"<p>Hello there. Another intriguing casual OTK deck to showcase! Let's see how...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Draw a lot of cards with Panda and Saryuja. Then...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) Turn 1: Send Neko+Elephant+Slifer to GY. You can do as mentioned below to achieve this goal:</p><ul><li>Via Saryuja, summon those 3 minions and send them to GY by Link summoning other monsters. It's easy to achieve if you play ""Link Bound"" and ""Pot of Avarice"" when Saryuja is either present onboard or in GY.</li><li>""One for One"" and ""Foolish Burial"" accomplishes the same thing. Don't forget to target Elephant or Slifer first, then Neko for ""One for One"" to send those to GY. You will hit two birds with one stone by doing so. In the end, Link summoning any monster will take care of Neko.</li><li>Another way to send Elephant to GY is playing Saryuja &gt;&gt;&gt; Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Elephant combo in order. Since ""Flying Elephant"" is level 4 monster, ""Summoner Monk"" can search it. Then, you can Link summon to send the Elephant to GY.</li></ul><p>2) Set those cards below and end your turn. It doesn't have to be in order:</p><ul><li>H - Heated Heart</li><li>Give and Take</li><li>2 x Powerful Rebirth</li></ul><p>3) On your opponent's turn (Draw Phase), activate those traps and specific targets in order. To activate traps even during Draw Phase of your opponent, change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch+Hold"" and set to ""ON"" in-game. You can edit to ""Switch+Hold"" in ""Duel"" section of settings page:</p><ul><li>First, activate ""Powerful Rebirth"" and select ""Neko Mane King""</li><li>Next, activate ""Powerful Rebirth"" and select ""Flying Elephant""</li><li>Finally, activate ""Give and Take"" and select ""Slifer the Sky Dragon"". Target any minion but Link monster you have onboard.</li></ul><p>- Chain reactions will lead into skipping your opponent's turn.</p><p>4) Buff your Elephant with ""H - Heated Heart"" and hit your opponent directly with Elephant to win the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Want to save up SR and UR? Let me show you:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" can be unlocked through ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Slifer the Sky Dragon"" can be unlocked through ""The Great Olds"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" isn't really needed, if you are low on SR. Though it can be unlocked by opening ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack, Saryuja and other Link monsters can pick targets to refill GY for ""Pot of Avarice"" more than enough. 90 SR saved!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Link Spider"", ""Link Bound"" and LAN are given for free, if you've picked ""Link Generation"". Thus, 90 SR is saved!</p><p>- ""Moray of Greed"" can be a good and cheap alternative for drawing cards. 2xExodia+5x1*-Water or 3xExodia+4x1*-Water are perfect formulae for this card without making Wand and Spellbook cards redundant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 480 SR and 30 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this deck. Thanks for reading, feel free to ask anything. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Then, send both ""Magicians' Souls"" and ""Dark Magician"" to GY, in order to special summon ""Dark Magician"" on the battlefield.</li><li>Tutor ""Illusion of Chaos"" with ""Preparation of Rites"". Then, use the ability of ""Illusion of Chaos"" to tutor ""Dark Eradicator Warlock"".</li><li>Finally, special summon ""Dark Eradicator Warlock"" by tributing ""Dark Magician"". Burst your opponent's LP down to zero by playing lots of normal spells.</li><li>If you are short of ammunition, you can try again with Double Summon &gt;&gt;&gt; Necroface combo to refill your supplies. Don't forget to have 1-2 draw spells in advance to cycle like usual.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Need to save up SR and UR? Let me help with it:</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" and ""Allure of Darkness"" can be unlocked through ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 120 SR!</p><p>- ""Preparation of Rites"" can be unlocked through ""Miraculous Advent"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" isn't really needed, if you are low on SR. Though it can be unlocked by opening ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack, Saryuja and other Link monsters can pick targets to refill GY for ""Pot of Avarice"" more than enough. 90 SR saved!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be unlocked through ""Futuristic Creatures"" to save 30 UR. However, you don't need to bother with him at all, if you don't want to spend SR on ""Formula Synchron"".</p><p>- ""Illusion of Chaos"", ""Dark Magician"" and ""Magicians' Souls"" can be collected by purchasing ""Vortex of Magic"" deck. 90 UR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Link Spider"", ""Link Bound"" and LAN are given for free, if you've picked ""Link Generation"". Thus, 90 SR is saved!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be unlocked through timed selection pack called ""The Synchronized Cosmoc"". As of this writing, if you are willing to spend gems to save 30 UR, this is your chance.</p><p>- ""Moray of Greed"" can be a good and cheap alternative for drawing cards. 2xExodia+5x1*-Water or 3xExodia+4x1*-Water are perfect formulae for this card without making Wand and Spellbook cards redundant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 540 SR and 150 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this deck. Thanks for reading, feel free to ask anything. Have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Lava Golem keeps the field clean and burns, Golem Sentry bounces and acts as a mini-wall, and Dummy Golem is a free Creature Swap if you can pull it off: arguably even better as the ""can't change position"" restriction on that isn't on here, so you can use flip effects, attack, etc. This specific deck is pretty monster heavy, but the monsters used either boost up the consistency plays or let you get advantage one way or another.</p><p>I use cards like Momonga and Jujitsu Master as fake-outs for Nobleman plays, though they are also useful for establishing field presence if needed. Assailent is a must for a deck like this as it can pop + recycle all in a singular play. Gigantes plays off the overwhelming EARTH monsters in here.</p><p>Cretin is certainly weird old tech, however I felt like it really fitted here given it could either play into your other flip monsters or loop into itself if you have another in the graveyard. While the opponent also summoning isn't great, it's not a issue for this given there's so many ways of bouncing/tributing/switching threats away. Cretin into a Dummy to catch out someone using the special summon for a big play is always great to pull off and throws them for a loop given the card isn't well used, something the deck relies on to ambush them.&nbsp;</p><p>Guardian Sphinx basically forces non-battle removal if you can get it going so it was also a obvious pick for this, super oppressive. To finish off we have Tribe for clearing the field (given the lack of Rock support in conventional decks we don't have to worry about wiping out cards of our own) and Serpent for cost fodder.</p><p>Spells are conventional. Swords is good for stall and Book of Moon is amazing tech for getting another flip effect off, escaping removal like Ring or simply shutting down the opponent.&nbsp;</p><p>We run three Compulsory as it can delay the opponent massively while protecting the weaker monsters. Sunlight is underrated Goat tech that lets you escape a Nobleman or other more restrictive removal options. Threatening Roar is a top tier stall card and used here to keep your plays fresh for the next turn while controlling the pace more.</p><p>Side deck is varied, either throwing in more flip support, counters to popular builds or even trying for a Heavy Slump combo because why not, it's funny to do.

This attempts to fix that with a more proactive build.&nbsp;</p><p>So this is Cannon Soldier burn.....but it's got a Chaos Control build in it for a few reasons. For one, Scapegoat is the MVP of the deck: it's 2000 damage with a single card and monster. You need ways to recycle it, so Magician of Faith is perfect for that role and helps consistency, draw power...basically everything. I use Toon Soldier because you can mill it out with Toon Table to turn this into a 36 card deck if RNG is in your favour. Not really a reason to use the regular one aside from the attacking restriction....who cares about that though?</p><p>Second, Chaos Control builds well for keeping the pace of the game in your favour. Tomato/Sangan/Assailent all act as great additions that keep to the theme of making this deck very snappy and searches out your plays wherever far faster. Tsukuyomi is iconic in this kind of deck because it lets you reuse the flip effects, either for additional destruction, burning, or getting your plays back. Black Luster is very useful as a alt-win condition and/or easy removal. Koala is a cool dude and the easiest big damage card in the whole deck pretty much, plus Chaos fodder so no worries either way.&nbsp;</p><p>Third is the meta mind-game that goes into a deck like this. The opponent expects burn....you throw Chaos at them. Vice versa as well. It plays them for a loop and makes side-decking a lot harder given you are trying to counter two popular builds as opposed to one.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside all of this we use the usual stall cards to keep the opponent's removal busy or do additional damage like with Wave-Motion. Thanks to the power of janky old technicalities Soul Exchange can be used as cost for Cannon Soldier's effect, letting you get essentially a Kaiju-lite removal + burn damage with ease on whatever you want.&nbsp;</p><p>Side deck is a mix of going into actual Goat Control plays to throw the opponent off (not to mention it benefits you anyway given Thousand can stall as well until you get rid of it) going into Panda Burn to do more aggressive plays or simple and reliable counters to popular builds. Dustshoot is good for monster-heavy decks and Desert Sunlight protects your plays from someone throwing more Noblemen at you. Using this right, it's pretty reliable at what it does here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

She is a fusion of organic and artificial elements, evident in her stunning physique. At six foot tall, she boasts an athletic build honed by her dedication to Yoga practices within the library premises. Her unique feature is her ability to produce milk despite being in her prime, which further accentuates her femininity.As we gaze upon her, our attention is drawn to her wardrobe choices. She dons a matching set of nude-colored lace lingerie adorned with subtle green illumination. The ensemble consists of a pair of knee-length stockings, a thong, and a push-up bra that accentuate her buxom chest. Despite the practicality of these garments, they serve more as a visual treat for anyone present.This goddess embraces technology, sporting robotic limbs that complement her natural ones. These enhancements provide added strength and agility during her workout sessions, which take place amidst towering stacks of books. To avoid the harsh rays of the sun, she has incorporated several upgrades to protect herself &ndash; most notably, her right arm now glows a brilliant emerald green whenever it senses impending danger.Described as having a warm and inviting demeanor, she projects a sense of contentment and inner peace. With porcelain skin and deep ocean blue eyes, she exudes a captivating appearance. She balances her features with a smattering of pink eyeshadow and perfectly arched eyebrows. Her thick, sky blue hair cascades down her back in the shape of a fish tail, complete with delicate pink streaks that catch the light. It's impossible not to notice her enchanting smile, revealing two razor-sharp fangs that hint at her true nature.In this piece, our subject is depicted engaging in a private moment of self-care. Wearing her signature lace undies, she performs inverted yogic postures upon a hot pink, flourescent yoga mat, surrounded by various tomes and ancient texts. In front of her lies a dusty tome, filled with esoteric knowledge and spells designed to harness the power of the universe itself. As she peruses its pages, her mind expands beyond what was once thought possible, unlocking secrets hidden away for centuries.With each passing day, her skills in both magic and martial arts continue to grow stronger. Now, let us explore the history behind the creation of this magnificent being and how she came to occupy this sacred space.The image depicts a breathtaking view of a cybernetic vampiress, poised in a serene position atop a mound of antique books. Her slender frame and sharp features, combined with her pale complexion and vivid blue eyes, exude a regal air. The focal point of the artwork is a close-up shot of the vampiress, dressed in a fitted bodysuit made entirely out of iridescent liquid metal. Every ripple and crevice of her form can be seen clearly through the material, showcasing her toned legs and arms.</p><p>On either side of her, towering shelves stretch towards the ceiling, teeming with an endless collection of rare tomes and precious scrolls. Each volume appears aged beyond measure, bound in rich fabrics such as silk and velvet. Many contain mysterious symbols etched into their covers, while others display intricate illustrations of fantastical creatures and far-off lands.Above her head, a massive stained-glass window bathes the chamber in a rainbow of colors, adding an ethereal quality to the entire scene. Behind the vampiress, a grandiose spiral staircase ascends toward unknown heights, disappearing into the darkness above. Its polished wooden steps gleam softly in the diffused light filtering through the stained glass panels.To her left and right, ornate pedestals stand guard over priceless artifacts, sparkling beneath the celestial radiance pouring in from the skylight. A golden grimoire adorned with rubies rests on one pedestal, its pages filled with incantations capable of reshaping reality itself. On the opposite side stands a sleek, futuristic wand crafted from translucent crystal infused with arcane circuitry. This magical tool harnesses the raw energy flowing throughout the cosmos, empowering the vampiress' every move.</p><p>Surrounding the pedestals are rows of plush velvet seating arranged in a semi-circle around an elevated stage. Here, the vampiress often conducts lectures and seminars, sharing her vast knowledge of both magic and martial arts with those seeking to follow in her footsteps.Beyond the amphitheater lies a sprawling hallway, its walls lined with portraits of esteemed sorceresses who have come before. Their eyes seem to follow the viewer as they pass by, whispering tales of valorous battles fought against dark forces threatening realms yet unknown.Farther down the corridor, a set of double doors made of burnished bronze leads to a subterranean training facility. Here, the vampiress hones her physical prowess, pushing herself to new limits under the watchful gaze of sentient constructs programmed to aid in her development.</p><p>Throughout the academy, intricate patterns of vines and leaves twist along the walls and pillars. They appear almost lifelike in their detail, as if imbued with some inherent vitality waiting to burst forth.</p><p>With each breath, the air hums with potent magical energies, a testament to the countless hours spent honing the arts practiced within. The Valkyries' Sanctum represents a haven for those seeking knowledge and power, steeped in tradition yet forever evolving towards even greater heights.""In this breathtaking vision, a cybernetic vampiress stands atop a pile of antique books, her lithe figure draped in a fluid suit of iridescent cerulean fabric. The garment flows like water around her curves, highlighting her supple movements and enhancing her striking features. Shimmering veins of electric blue pulse across the surface of the suit, symbolizing the union between cutting-edge technology and innate mystical abilities. With confidence radiating from every pore, she commands attention as the epitome of strength, wisdom, and beauty.As your gaze drifts upward, you notice two imposing statues flanking the entrance to the Academy. These majestic sculptures portray valkyries mid-flight, their wings unfurled and spears at the ready. Made from a combination of organic materials and synthetic composites, these sentinels embody the blending of nature and technology that defines the Valkyries' Sanctum.Every aspect of this awe-inspiring setting exudes sophistication and expertise, hinting at the rigorous training and profound knowledge awaiting those fortunate enough to call it home. The Valkyries' Sanctum serves not only as an educational institution but also as a bastion of hope, defending humanity against the threats lurking just beyond our understanding. As you take in the grandeur surrounding you, you cannot help but feel awestruck and inspired by the magnitude of what has been accomplished here. This captivating image invokes a sense of wonder and reverence, transporting viewers directly into the heart of the Valkyries' Sanctum. The focus centers on the cybernetic vampiress perched upon a mountain of ancient tomes, her metallic limbs gracefully extended as she balances atop the literary trove.Her body, adorned in a delicate mesh of glowing wireframe lines, seems to shift and undulate like living fabric. This dynamic suit not only enhances her natural agility and combat capabilities but also symbolizes the harmonious fusion of biological and artificial elements.Behind the vampiress rise towering bookshelves, their shelves crammed full of leather-bound volumes and scrolls bearing illegible scripts. The dim ambiance creates a cozy atmosphere, perfect for intellectual pursuits or quiet contemplation.At the edge of the room, two valkyrie statues stand vigilant, their wings spread wide as if caught in the act of descending from the heavens above. Crafted from polished marble, their faces exhibit fierce determination and unwavering resolve. Each statue bears a unique runic inscription etched onto its base, paying homage to the legendary heroics of these powerful female warriors.The library itself is bathed in a warm golden glow, casting long shadows across the floor as the afternoon sun streams through stained glass windows. Delicate engravings and intricate carvings decorate every available space, telling the stories of past valkyries and chronicling their triumphs over the ages.As your lips met, everything fell into place. The world beyond ceased to exist, replaced instead by the warmth radiating between you. Cassandra's arms wrapped around your shoulders, pulling you impossibly closer. Her scent enveloped you, triggering an all-consuming hunger deep within. Without another thought, you gave in to instinct and deepened the kiss.</p><p>Your hands wandered, mapping out the curves of Cassandra's form. Each brush of fingertips sent sparks coursing through your bodies, igniting a fire that burned brightly between you. Her skin was soft beneath your fingertips, supple yet strong. You couldn't get enough, so you explored further, learning each nuance of her body as if it were your own.Every breath was filled with the taste of her &ndash; sweet musk blending with the subtlest hints of copper. Blood pulsed just below the surface, promising life and vitality. The realization made your mouth water, but you pushed aside the urge, focusing instead on the present moment. Nothing mattered more than this perfect snapshot frozen in time.Cassandra's touch was equally fervent. She pressed against you with a fierce intensity, as if trying to meld your souls together. Her fingers trailed down your spine, sending shivers throughout your entire body. When they reached the small of your back, you broke the kiss, gasping for air.Without words, you both knew what came next. There was no need for discussion when emotions ran so high. Your bond transcended language, leaving only pure feeling. Cassandra led you to the bedroom, her movements fluid and graceful. You followed willingly, unable to resist her siren call.Once inside, you discarded your clothes piece by piece, never breaking eye contact. Cassandra watched with rapt fascination, hungry for every inch of you. When you were both fully exposed, you collapsed onto the bed in a tangled heap of limbs.Your bodies meshed perfectly, each curve matching those of the other. Cassandra's breasts pressed against yours, their fullness filling your palms. Skin slid against skin, creating a friction that built toward something more. Desire throbbed between your legs, demanding attention.You didn't disappoint. With deliberate strokes, your fingers traced the contours of Cassandra's body. Soft gasps accompanied each caress, proof of how sensitive she had become. When your digits grazed her inner thighs, she parted them slightly, inviting you deeper.Taking the cue, you delved into the heart of Cassandra's womanhood. Your tongue darted out, lapping at her wetness before pressing firmly against her clit. The resulting moans were music to your ears, fueling your determination to drive her wild.Time seemed to stand still as you devoted yourself entirely to pleasuring Cassandra. Every lick, every suck, every finger probing deeply inside her &ndash; it all served a singular purpose: to bring her to the brink of ecstasy. Slowly but surely, you drew her ever closer to that precipice, savoring every moment along the way.When Cassandra finally cried out, bucking wildly underneath you, you grinned victoriously. Her release was your reward, a testament to your skill and devotion. Lying spent beside each other, you basked in the afterglow of shared intimacy.It was in these quiet moments that the true depth of your connection became apparent. Though words weren't necessary, your feelings spoke volumes. This wasn't merely physical attraction; it was a profound understanding, a recognition of sorts. You belonged together &ndash; always.</p><p>As you lay tangled together in bed, you ran your hands appreciatively over Cassandra's toned figure. Though still clothed in her form-fitting bodysuit and high boots, there was no denying her raw physical appeal. Her lean yet powerful build seemed tailored expressly for seduction, and her piercing gaze remained fixed on yours alone.Without breaking eye contact, you slid your hand between her legs and cupped her crotch possessively. Flexing your fingers against the supple material covering her mons pubis, you felt Cassandra's breath catch in her throat. A faint blush crept up her cheeks despite the dim lighting of the room, betraying how much she desired your touch.Eager to oblige, you shifted your weight and straddled her torso. Grinning wickedly, you planted another series of featherlight kisses across Cassandra's jawline, pausing only when you reached her earlobe. There, you whispered hoarsely about all the wicked things you intended to do to her body.Cassandra's reply came out as a low growl, sending thrills coursing through your veins. Taking this as encouragement, you released the front clasp of her bodysuit and peeled apart the halves to expose her breasts. Cupping them reverently in your palms, you lavished attention on their rosy nipples before transferring your focus to Cassandra's neck.Tracing gentle patterns across her jugular with your tongue, you listened carefully for the telltale accelerations of her pulse. Once confident you had located the most vulnerable spot, you lunged forward and closed your teeth around the tender flesh. Cassandra hissed in surprise but didn't attempt to fight back, clearly trusting you implicitly.</p><p>As you drank deeply of her blood, the euphoric rush hit you almost instantly. Your senses amplified tenfold, and your body hummed with unspoken desires. When at last you pulled away, Cassandra stared up at you expectantly, her expression both eager and uncertain.You understood exactly what she craved &ndash; the chance to serve as your accomplice in pleasure, to indulge in the taboo thrill of vampire intimacy. With a seductive smile, you lowered your head once more and resumed your exploration of Cassandra's body. This time, however, your motives were not purely altruistic.Skilled fingers danced across the contours of Cassandra's chest, tracing intricate designs amidst the patchwork of scars crisscrossing her torso. You reveled in her strength and endurance, marveling at how such unsightly marks could become beautiful under your attentive gaze.Encouraged by Cassandra's contented sighs, you continued your journey southward. The tight fabric of her suit created an irresistible friction against your skin as you dragged your nails lightly along her abdomen, eliciting a shiver from her frame. In response, she parted her thighs, granting you access to the heart of her desire.Sliding one hand between her legs, you found her already slick with anticipation. Eyes locked on hers, you began to circle her clitoris with your fingers, watching as her eyes fluttered shut and her breathing quickened. As your other hand rose to cup a full breast, Cassandra arched her spine, silently begging for greater stimulation.Granting her wish, you increased the pressure of your touch, teasing her swollen nubbin until it stood proud and aching. Simultaneously, you rolled her nipple between your thumb and forefinger, relishing the answering groan that escaped her lips. It was clear that Cassandra hungered for release; thus, you redoubled your efforts, determined to bring her to the brink of ecstasy.The air grew heavy with tension, charged by the electric energy crackling between you. Time seemed suspended as you dueled with Cassandra's climax, pushing her ever closer to the edge without quite allowing her to tip over. Every gasp, every tremble communicated her intense pleasure, driving you to new heights of passion.In the end, it wasn't simply the act of bringing Cassandra to orgasm that fueled your desire. Rather, it was the knowledge that you held dominion over her very soul, that she would freely give herself to you time and again, seeking solace within the tempest of your embrace. For in this moment, you were one &ndash; bound together by love and lust, forever entwined in each other's hearts.</p><p>As you lay entwined with Cassandra, the warmth of her body radiated throughout yours like a comforting embrace. Your breaths synchronized, rising and falling in unison as your hearts beat steadily against one another. In this tranquil state, your mind drifted to thoughts of the pleasure ahead &ndash; the promise of mutual fulfillment that awaited.A gentle stroke of Cassandra's fingernails across your scalp jolted you from your reverie. Her hand continued its slow descent down your arm, eliciting a series of goosebumps in its path. As it settled over your chest, you felt the weight of her touch press against your breast.The sensation stirred a flutter within your stomach, spreading heat to every corner of your body. You arched your back ever so slightly, silently encouraging Cassandra to continue. Without hesitation, she responded by cupping your breast, her thumb brushing lightly against your nipple.Instinctively, you let out a sultry sigh, which resonated within the room. It was as though you had awoken some primal force within you, a power that begged to be released. Your desire grew stronger with each passing second, building towards a crescendo that threatened to consume you both.Eager to indulge this newfound hunger, Cassandra shifted her attention to your neck, nibbling and teasing the sensitive flesh until you squirmed beneath her. Your lips met in a passionate, insistent kiss, tongues intertwining in a dance of wanton abandon.As your ardor intensified, Cassandra's nimble fingers worked their magic upon your body. They glided down your torso, skimming past your hips and into the cradle of your thighs. You parted your legs eagerly, granting her access to the source of your growing euphoria.Her finger hovered above your clitoris, poised to deliver the final blow. Time seemed to stand still, the anticipation nearly unbearable. And then, without warning, she made contact.An intense burst of pleasure echoed through your entire being as Cassandra's finger began to slowly circle around your clitoris. The sensation was almost too much to bear - hot waves of ecstasy coursing through you as you writhed beneath her touch. But you didn't want it to end just yet. So you pulled her head close and whispered sweet nothings into her ear, urging her to keep going.Cassandra listened carefully to your cues and adjusted her technique accordingly. She increased the pressure and pace of her strokes, applying just the right amount of friction to send shockwaves of bliss cascading through your body. You couldn't help but cry out in delight as your orgasm approached, feeling your muscles tense up and your pulse quicken.Finally, when you thought you couldn't take any more, Cassandra delivered the coup de grace. With one swift motion, she pressed harder than ever before, sending you hurtling over the edge into a realm of pure, unbridled joy. Wave after wave of pleasure crashed over you, leaving you weakened and utterly satisfied.But Cassandra wasn't done yet. Even as you struggled to catch your breath, she moved lower, lavishing attention on your inner thighs and pelvis with her talented tongue. Each lap and lick sent fresh tremors through your body, reigniting the fire within you and setting you on the path to a second climax.You couldn't believe how responsive your body remained, even after such an intense orgasm. But Cassandra clearly knew what she was doing, expertly coaxing forth another eruption of euphoria from deep within you. This time, you let loose with a loud, triumphant scream, consumed entirely by the ecstatic haze enveloping you. Eventually, your gasps subsided and you floated back down to earth, content and satiated beyond measure. Cassandra smiled knowingly as she gazed up at you, her eyes filled with pride and adoration. Together, you basked in the afterglow, grateful for the intimate bond that allowed you to share such Grateful for the intimate bond that allowed you to share such intimacy, you wrapped your arms around Cassandra and held her close. Feeling her heartbeat against yours, you realized that this moment was worth all the struggles leading up to it. Everything else melted away as you relished in the warmth and security of each other's embrace. Without saying a word, Cassandra gently rocked you back and forth, soothing you with her touch. It was as if she could sense everything you were feeling, and wanted to make sure you felt completely at peace. In this moment, you knew with certainty that you had found someone who truly understood you. Someone who would always be there for you, no matter what challenges life threw your way. As you lay there together, lost in your own little world, you realized that this was only the beginning. There would be many more nights like this, nights spent exploring each other's bodies and souls. Nights where words weren't necessary, because actions spoke louder than anything else. Nights that would fill you with happiness and love, sealing your bond forever.And with that knowledge, you closed your eyes, feeling happier and more complete than you had in a long time. Knowing that you finally had someone special in your life, someone who truly got you and accepted you for who you are. Someone who would never give up on you, no matter what.Together, you drifted off to sleep, dreaming of all the adventures that lay ahead. Knowing that nothing could ever come between you two, now or ever again. Upon seeing you, Cassandra rushed forward with reckless abandon. In her haste, she nearly tripped over her own feet as she stumbled towards you. Your eyes locked together, neither of you able to break away from the other's gaze. Time seemed to stand still as you both regarded each other, unsure of who should make the first move.</p><p>It wasn't long before Cassandra made up her mind. With a sudden burst of determination, she grabbed fistfuls of her own skirt and yanked it up over her hips. Before you knew it, she had stripped off her underwear entirely, revealing her bare form to your eager eyes. You watched in fascination as Cassandra discarded her remaining garments with practiced ease, leaving nothing but her heels and stockings. Even those fell quickly to the floor as she kicked them aside impatiently. Now completely nude, she stood before you, vulnerable and exposed. Despite her initial boldness, Cassandra now looked uncertain. She shifted nervously from foot to foot, unsure of whether you would accept her offer. When you finally broke the silence by stepping forward to claim her, a relieved smile crossed her face.Without hesitation, you wrapped your arms around her, pulling her close. She molded herself against you eagerly, her warmth seeping into your skin. Together, you descended onto the bed, tangled limbs intertwining as you lost yourself in the passion of the moment. From then on, there was no turning back.As you explored every inch of each other's bodies, you became acutely aware of Cassandra's curves and contours. Her generous bust spilled out of her unfastened bra, begging for your touch. You obliged, running your hands over her soft flesh and teasing her nipples between your fingers.Meanwhile, Cassandra wasted no time in returning the favor. She traced lines down your abdomen, dipping below your waistband to cup your rear end and pull you impossibly closer. The friction generated by your entwined bodies left you both breathless, heightening the desire burning within you.But even as you reveled in each other's caresses, you couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. It wasn't until Cassandra caught sight of your neglected state that everything clicked into place. With a knowing grin, she produced a bottle of lubricant from amidst the cluttered sheets and offered it to you. In an instant, all doubts vanished. With renewed vigor, you set to work preparing her for what was to come. Every stroke of the wand sent shockwaves through Cassandra's frame, causing her to buck and writhe in ecstasy. By the time you deemed her ready, she was practically quivering with anticipation.And so, without further ado, you lowered yourself onto her waiting form. Her walls stretched to accommodate you, welcoming you inside with open arms. For a few glorious moments, you simply existed in this space &ndash; two individuals joined as one.Soon enough, however, the primal urge to move took hold. You began to rock your hips, gradually building momentum. Each thrust brought a fresh surge of pleasure, culminating in a series of explosive climaxes that left you spent and satisfied.Eventually, as your heart rates slowed and your breathing steadied, you disengaged and collapsed beside Cassandra. Despite the sweat plastering your skin to hers, you felt content and at peace. No words were necessary &ndash; just the comforting knowledge that you'd shared something truly special.As I continue my quest for knowledge, I find myself drawn to the library once again. The cool air and soft hum of pages turning provide an escape from the chaos outside. But tonight, something else calls to me...the thrill of the chase. My legs carry me deeper into the stacks, my heart racing with anticipation. My breath comes quick and heavy as I push past rows of books, searching for my prey. And then, I see him - a young man, lost in his studies, oblivious to danger. With a wicked grin, I draw closer, my sharp teeth glinting in the dim light. He senses nothing until it's too late. One swift strike and he falls beneath my power, struggling weakly against the hold I have on him. His blood flows freely, and I savor every drop, feeling strength course through me. But hunger isn't the only thing driving me tonight. Inspiration strikes, and I let go of my prize, watching him crumple to the floor. From within my bag, I produce my journal, a blank canvas waiting to be brought to life. With graceful strokes of my quill, I pour out my thoughts onto the page, letting the words flow like the blood that pulsates through my veins. Time stands still as I write, each sentence born of the darkness that dwells inside me. And when at last I am done, I read my masterpiece aloud, the sound of my voice filling the quiet room. Satisfied, I gather my things and exit the library, eager to share my creation with others. For I am not just a predator, but also an artist. And in the end, isn't that what truly matters? To create something beautiful, even if it comes at a cost."" This short piece combines elements of horror and eroticism, exploring the concept of the vampire as both predator and artist. It uses descriptive language and imagery to set the scene and build tension, culminating in a dramatic reveal of the protagonist's true nature.</p>"

Past eff banish Light -&gt; Light eff summon Water -&gt; Draw 2 -&gt; Stardust Charge. Vision is basicly just 3 extra copies for that 2 card combo as it searches any of the other Fortune Lady cards. Your gameplan after that is to loop your Synchro back into the ED with De-Synchro to draw 2 via Water every time + generic draw spells.</p><p>Magical Stone Excav let's you dump the 2nd Water into the GY for Monster Reborn while also giving you a copy of any spell (usually De-Synchro) back. More than 1 felt incredibly bricky though. More than 2 Water also seemed suboptimal due to only ever being able to loop 2 anyway.</p><p>IOC + Souls not only works as Fodder for Allure in a pinch, Souls + Past + Water after the first De-Synchro also makes Moonflowerviewing wich is a non OPT draw 1. Add to that how you can use Chicken Game + Vision on field for another Draw 2 that doesn't affect your number of cards in hand for Mallet and it's easy to see why it's a must include.</p><p>The must haves for the ED are:</p><p>Charge Warrior (Past + Water w/ Past eff)</p><p>Moonflowerviewing (Past + Water + Souls)</p><p>Crocodragon (Past + Water + Water)</p><p>Any Lvl 5 (Past + Water w/ no Past eff)</p><p>Anything else is largely optional. Chaos Ruler won me like 2 games where the last Exodia piece was in the bottom 5 cards. Pep won some games solo after Allure banished a Exodia piece and might honestly be the most worth plan b card due to people just not reading it. Formula, Tatsunoko, Pixie &amp; Sigma also all came up once, but thats in like 50-100 games played so def not needed if you aren't trying to win 1% more.</p>"

Let's get into the action...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) Draw a lot of cards with Panda and Saryuja or Librarian and Formula until you reach the situation illustrated below. Don't forget to send ""Neko Mane King"" to the GY...</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/tx9YKxW.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>You need to have ""Overlay Regen"" + ""Waking the Dragon"" + ""Powerful Rebirth"" in your hand.</li><li>""Treasure Panda"" must be able to Special Summon at least twice, to be exact.</li><li>""Silent Wobby"" must be at the rightmost place while ""Yajiro Invader"" needs to be at the center. After that, Link Summon ""Geonator Transverser"" by using two effect monsters on the battlefield, which are Saryuja and Imduk in this case.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) After you've Link Summoned ""Geonator Transverser"", activate her ability to swap pieces as illustrated below:</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/aPgYcfd.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>From here, we will Special summon a lot. Yajiro is trying to catch up whatever we will Special Summon while destroying everything he touches, which is essential for the IC1000 FTK combo.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) Set ""Waking the Dragon"" to 2nd column...</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/4Aqtd9F.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) ...and Special Summon a monster via ""Treasure Panda"" to 2nd column. What Yajiro is going to do is to move to 2nd column and destroy everything within his sight.</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/TMIiluU.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5) Thanks to the interaction between ""Waking the Dragon"" and ""Yajiro Invader"", we can Special Summon ""Number C1000: Numerounius"" on the battlefield. Special Summon this card to the 4th column, while Yajiro is trying to catch up.</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/vVSEf1h.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Meanwhile, attach ""Overlay Regen"" into the C1000. If C1000 is destroyed with a material attached, this card can Special Summon IC1000 thanks to its effect.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6) Special Summon another monster via Panda one more time to the 5th column. There, Yajiro is trying to catch up 5th column while destroying C1000. While at it, set ""Powerful Rebirth"" card.</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/RxzFUs6.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7) Thanks to the ability of C1000, condition is met. Therefore, we can Special Summon ""Number IC1000: Numerounius Numerounia"" on the battlefield. Put IC1000 to the 2nd column and watch Yajiro trying to catch up.</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/I2MPYfm.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>This is the final setup before ending our turn.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8) On your opponent's turn (Draw Phase), activate ""Powerful Rebirth"". Then, Special Summon ""Neko Mane King"" to the 4th column and let Yajiro kill Neko. Since your opponent's turn will be skipped thanks to the ability of Neko, IC1000's ability will be activated. It reads ""At the end of your opponent's turn, if this card did not battle, you win the Duel."" and victory shall be ours!</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/RZbHA82.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>To activate any trap even during Draw Phase of your opponent, change ""Activation Confirmation"" to ""Switch+Hold"" and set to ""ON"" in-game. You can edit to ""Switch+Hold"" in ""Duel"" section of settings page.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading the guide. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I was preparing it extensively. If you want to look for means of saving up some SR and UR points, I got you covered:</p><p>- C1000 and IC1000 can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack to save 60 UR!</p><p>- ""Allure of Darkness"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 30 SR!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" isn't really needed, if you are low on SR. Though it can be unlocked by opening ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack, Saryuja and other Link monsters&nbsp;can pick targets to refill GY for ""Pot of Avarice"" more than enough. 90 SR saved!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR. However, you don't need to bother with him at all, if you don't want to spend SR on ""Formula Synchron"".</p><p>- ""Neko Mane King"" and ""Silent Wobby"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"". Hope you were lucky to have them. Thus, 60 SR saved!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Link Spider"", ""Link Bound"" and LAN are given for free, if you've picked ""Link Generation"". Thus, 90 SR is saved!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 480 SR and 90 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

You get an extremely competent meta deck that will quickly outpace your opponents! Piloted correctly and skillfully, this deck can eventually reward you Masters 1 rank.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>Negate with Spright Red/Carrot, control and break boards with Runick spells, and deal with pesky graveyard with the newly introduced Bystials! In addition to searching from deck, all these archetypes draw cards as well, granting you up to 6+ cards per turn (Draw 3+ with Runick Fountain(s), draw 2 with Ipiria/Capshell in Sprights, and draw 1 with Branded Regained)!<br /><br />With the Ishizu graveyard shufflers mostly gone and Tearlaments nerfed, Spright along with it's best buddy Runick is once again primed to take the competitive Masterduel meta crown by storm. Add Bystials into the mix, and now you have three advantage engines working flawlessly together to generate so much advantage/control that your opponent has no choice but to lose!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>This deck may be straightforward, but it rewards good decision making since boards and gamestates are determined by the pilot's skill and resource management. If you're a player who likes a resource-based control-focused grindgame, Spright Runick Bystial is the strategy for you.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</strong></em></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><strong>ARCHETYPES AND DECKBUILDING</strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div>Spright Runick Bystial is composed of the three mentioned archetypes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Spright creates solid boards by itself, offering draw power (Ipiria/Capshell), removal (Spright Smashers, Onibimaru Soul Sweeper), negates (Spright Red/Carrot), protection (I:P Masquerena-&gt;Avramax) and grindgame recursion (Spright Elf).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Runick offers the main win condition of this deck by banishing your opponent's deck. It also can summon a level 2 to start off your Spright combo in the form of Runick Hugin while simultanously searching for Runick Fountain, allowing you to draw up to three cards. Runick spells also break opponent's boards fairly well when played correctly in tandem with the other archetypes. Runick offers solid defensive options in a pinch, with Hugin protecting against destruction effects while Geri dissuades the opponent from attacking.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Bystial is the newcomer to this strategy, and it serves as a hard counter to popular meta and rogue decks on ladder since they banish crucial light/dark monsters in the GY, such as Tearlaments, Branded, Sky Striker and Eldlich. In these matchups a critical mass of Bystials often is a free win, especially since they generate so much advantage on their own especially with Branded Regained on the field. Bystials also are excellent going-second cards, allowing you to smash boards with their giant 2500ATK bodies before you lock yourself out of the battlephase with Runick cards.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The rest of the cards are the generic must-have staples in Masterduel meta, with Ash Blossom, Maxx ""C,"" and Crossout. Maxx and Ash are at two to prevent opening doubles of the same card. A 40 card deck is used since there are no garnets/bricks in the deck and to maximize consistency.&nbsp;</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span><br class=""ContentPasted0"" /></strong></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">&nbsp;</strong></span></strong></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">The strategy of Spright Runick Bystial is to control/banish your opponent's cards until they surrender or deck-out. In certain situations, you can also enter the battle phase and OTK your opponent. The ridiculous resource advantage and control options each archetype gives the duelist should win them the duel in most circumstances.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">There is no particular combo line that this strategy uses. Mostly, this deck just summons Hugin to start off with the Runick portion of the deck. The presence Hugin then allows the special summons of Spright monsters so you can full combo. Bystials are not particularly ""needed,"" but if you draw into Lubellion, Magnamhut and Branded Regained, it grants you massive resources, interruptions and free bodies on the field.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">The deck's endboard is similar to the usual Spright endboard, consisting of Spright Elf, Spright Red + Spright Carrot, and perhaps an I:P Masquerena/Djinn Buster. The backrow has Runick Fountain and perhaps Branded Regained with a set Spright smashers. That's not all to your ""board,"" since the hand likely contains several Runick quick-plays, Bystials and generic handtraps! The interruptions that your opponent will have to slog through may number 3-7+, which every strategy will have to fear and respect.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div><div>Since this is a toolbox control strategy, the use of each card is unique and situational - after Hugin -&gt; Full Spright combo, the duel is usually non-linear. Instead, the game is dependent on the pilot's decision-making, resource advantage skills and knowledge of the specific match-up. If played maximimally, this deck can obliterate opponents going first and second, even through many interruptions.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>With the unique control each archetype offers and the draw 3-6+ every turn, your opponent should wither away while you snowball card advantage to victory.&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1""><span class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div></div><div><div><div><span><span><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">GENERAL TIPS</span></strong></span></span></div><div><ul><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Similarly to Sky Striker, this is a toolbox control resource deck. It has a high skill ceiling since it factors in a player's decision making, resource management and match-up knowledge. Practice makes perfect with the deck!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Keep in mind that Spright Starter and Gigantic Spright lock you into only level/rank/link-2s! Don't lock yourself out of Bystials/Extra deck monsters at the wrong time!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Bystials are excellent when breaking boards, beating down small monsters and baiting interruption. Ishizu GY shufflers are particularly eager to use their effects when your Bystial summons from hand, so when they're used up you can safely use Spright Elf/Runick Fountain later on.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">This deck can generate so many bodies on board that it can easily OTK your opponent. If you feel your opponent cannot withstand your attack and they're out of resources, try to intentionally hold back from using Runick cards so you can enter the battle phase to finish them off!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">When facing a multi-negate/interruption board, bait out cards until you can activate your strongest starter. The cards that absolutely must resolve if you want to win the duel is Runick Fountain's draw 3, or Spright Blue/Starter for the full combo. If you resolve either of these, you can usually slog through an opponent's board, no matter how hard they try.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Remember, if Spright Elf is on the Extra Monster Zone, you cannot summon the defensive Runick fusions Hugin and Geri! Keep that in mind when facing certain match-ups (especially blind-second strategies), or if you feel a certain fieldwipe or attack is coming your way.&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">In my opinion, this deck has no major choke points. If your Spright Starter or Runick Hugin get negated for example, you can pivot into the other archetypes and advance your gamestate!</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">Hugin's search effect for Runick Fountain isn't once per turn. If you can spare the cards, you can still search for Runick Fountain a second time! This makes Hugin ideal ""Ash bait.""&nbsp;</li><li class=""ContentPasted0"">If your opponent Maxx ""C,""'s you, stop summoning and don't take the maxx c challenge! It's not worth giving your opponent more resources when you're righting a resource war.</li></ul></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><p class=""MsoNormal""><em><strong class=""ContentPasted0"">Want to see the deck in action? Scroll to the very bottom for the Youtube video!</strong></em></p></div><div><strong>CONCLUDING REMARKS</strong></div></div></div><div><span>I dunno about you guys, but drawing 5+ cards per turn is sooooo satisfying! Ending on a multiple negate board with 6 cards in hand makes you feel like the RICHEST, most ballin' duelist ever! The toolbox control gameplay is extremely fun and rewarding as well, since every game feels like winning a hard-fought battle utilizing a mastermind's tactician's decision making combined with a strategist's logistical mastery.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>The Runick archetype is thematically really cool, since it feels like the POV art of each Runick card feels like I'm fighting on the Yugioh battlefield and slaying monsters like the Doomslayer or Skyrim Dragonborn with my adventure party (yeah I know I'm such a nerd lmao). It is perfect for those of us who like to self-insert themselves into our duels with an over-active imagination and bring out the ""RP"" in Role-Playing Games!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><span>There is a reason why Spright variants are the most dominant deck on ladder right now, it outclasses Branded and Tearlaments because of it's sheer resource advantage and control capabilities. Able to go first and second while fitting soooo many generic staples in the deck and simultaneously hosting 3 archetypes seamlessly awards the strategy with so much versatility and power for every match-up. I dare say it's the perfect deck to climb ladder in Masterduel with! I'll see you guys at Masters 1 - I look forward to the mirror match. 😉&nbsp;<br /><br />GLHF Duelists! <br /></span></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Drain Zombie is all about abusing the incredible power of the Zombie engine in Goat alongside Skill Drain to disable everything else, giving you barely any issues as you play floaters and other monsters that bypass the typically devastating impact of the card, making for a impressively restrictive deck that tends to be a fantastic counter to many of the most popular decks used. For that reason almost every monster here does one or the other pretty much, even Sangan and Newdoria are used for that same reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Spells are conventional. Creature Swap is used to run into your own floaters, Book of Life is just Zombie 101 and Smashing is top-tier removal for big plays that are hard to run over.</p><p>Traps focus mostly on either keeping the field controlled or using stuff like Dustshoot to get a good idea of what's being played against you alongside taking away potential big plays against what the deck tries to do.</p><p>Side deck plays Golem for easy removal (and a great target for running into your cards/Creature Swap) Jinzo/Spell Canceller to handle decks that opt hard into either/or. Zombra is handy for a deck like this given the downsides are practially removed in favour of a very big beater. The rest are more or less generic side-counters to popular plays. Overall the deck is pretty aggressive, and I really dug it when I was trying it out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Absolutely love it! It's a lot of fun to play especially if you have free reign. Every ritual monster has its role. Great deck to run for first or second, it has options for both. The overall goal is to get out Draco turn one with any of your ritual monsters, but preferably Lord of the Red or Chaos Max. If you're fortunate enough you'll be able to get 3 boss monsters on the field first turn. Also, if possible try to summon Dracoverlord, then immediately after use gamma in your GY to remove dracoverlord from your field and into the GY. This way you can get another drytron on the field in order to use it to summon Fafnir (adding to the one you have already on the field) then F0 utopic and eventually Draco. Since you summoned dracoverlord before that, his effect goes into play and skips your opponents main phase one.&nbsp;</p>"

The one that was used for the 2021 Championship was omega bricky and just didn't really have much of a chance against actual aggressive and/or control-based builds. The solution? Make it less about combos and more about flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Emissary is a VERY good card in Goat Format, arguably underrated in some circles. It beats over most regular cards, searches on leaving the field, and is easily splashable in any deck that uses Normal monsters, AKA this one. Dragon Zombie is here for more beaters and Shine Balls are around for easy fodder for Smackdown to trigger alongside the usual Angel strat. The deck more or less relies on floating into everything while getting your Mokey on the field and angry for that big boost in ATK.</p><p>Spells aid by either stalling or teching around bigger targets, using Creature Swap to get rid of bounceable/weak monsters for better ones or Limit to benefit the usage of mostly sub level 4-monsters.</p><p>Traps aren't much to talk about. Skill Drain is a must in Emissary builds and it doesn't hurt the Mokey Mokey strat one bit. Human-Wave also helps if you have sacky plays that you want to run though.</p><p>Side-deck plays more into Chaos, conventional counters like Asura for Control or Hysteric to counter Ojama strats. Mobius is a useful tribute if required. Dancing Fairy is a weird one but if you can stall with her for a few turns she's pretty worth it just to handle Burn stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Siding into Goat Control is pretty easy given your Mokey Mokey's can also be played into Restrict, so it's not a issue throwing that in to blindside them. Combine that with a big aggro change into Decree and it turns into a drastically different deck altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

First time around i played a relativly standard Branded CyDra MD style list, always going blind 2nd. However, while catching people off guard with the PB OTK won me 2 out of 3 game 1s - game 2 they just forced me first and without Verte drawing into your CyDra engine is completely worthless. Game 3 they'd play fully prepared for going first as they know i had no option but to blind 2nd making games incredibly difficult without the factor of suprise.</p><p>Going back to the drawing board after this experience i decided i'll try a complete smokescreen approach to combat this weakness in a Bo3 environment.</p><p>For context in my first locals i went 1-3:<br />Match 1 - D.Link (OXX) - PB OTK game 1, forced first game 2, fully prepared for blind 2nd game 3<br />Match 2 - Agents (OXX) - PB OTK game 1, forced first game 2, close lose in time by 500 LP<br />Match 3 - Scrap Dinos (XX) - Couldn't quite OTK game 1 (missplayed too), completely pop off game 2<br />Match 4 (Bye)</p><p>The 2nd time around with this deck i was able to go 3-1:<br />Match 1 - Runick Fur Hire (OXO) - (Megafleet helped me close out the first game a turn earlier but it was mostly Dragoon + Masq who did all the heavy lifting, didn't actually side in the CyDra cards game 2 &amp; 3 as i think running over combo Runick variants is incredibly difficult.)<br />Match 2 - Ishizu Tearlament (XOO) - (Game 2 was just Branded but i was able to steal game 3 with a cheeky Twin Dragon OTK)<br />Match 3 - Floowandereeze (XX) - (Match was over in 5 minutes as my best play both games was Edge Imp Chain pass due to complete bricks, would've sided the CyDras here if i had won a game though)<br />Match 4 - LiveTwin Runick Spright (OXO) - (Same story as Match 1 were it was really just Dragoon doing the heavy lifting)</p><p>So due to 2 Runick matches and one quick 0-2 the funny part of the deck didn't actually come up too often, but it DID at least have some positive impact and was incredibly hilarious in the moments it did make an appearance.</p><p>For the main deck itself -<br />Magnamut - Would play it but sadly the seller i bought it from cancelled them on me last second so i had to make due (same thing for Fusion Deployment)<br />1-off targets for Crossout - Trying to maximize the impact the card has, as i am still not familiar with the meta game of the TCG there is def room for improvement here. Specifically the 1 Evenly &amp; Droll seemed very good though.<br />50 cards - This can definitely be improved but as siding in itself is something completely new to me playing more cards and giving myself more leeway seemed like a reasonable thing to do even if the end result looks very ugly. Trimming it down to 40-45 is most definitely something i would work on if i am able to return to real life yugioh in the future.<br />Missing Branded/Despia cards - obv playing standard is better than whatever this is, but due to the side being funny smokescreen you kinda run out of space for non-engine. In practice this leads to games like i had vs Floo were you just draw going 2nd cards you main instead of your missing ways to get to your Branded lines buuut funny.&nbsp;</p><p>In the ED i wasn't playing Dragostapelia due to not seeing a single Fusion deck my first time there and while Garura &amp; Mud do take care of the same things Starving Venom does the simple fact it can run over cards they can't would've come up if i had played it in my original list. Alba-Lenatus is kind of similiar were i wish i had taken it over Fortress due to seeing 0 Machine decks but multiple Dragon decks. Rindbrumm i also figured could come up vs Floo etc, in the end it didn't help at all but i think it was a solid idea.</p><p>In conclusion to make this potentially a lot less silly - You'd probably only want to smokescreen the part of CyDra i was main decking (OG+Herz+Megafleet+Rampage+Twin) in a normal Branded list w/o 50 card main deck running going 2nd cards. This would give you the normal meta strenght of Branded while not clogging your side for the funny too much. And i think as a going 2nd engine that part actually is solid, def not the BEST option but something spicy to bring to locals for a laugh for sure.</p>"

This version focuses more around balancing a Warrior toolbox while trying to establish a actual identity for Wanghu as a main deck slot without it seeming too forced.</p><p>The monsters were easy; you play stat-heavy stuff that punishes the heavy usage of flip monsters in basically every deck worth mentioning. That means Blade Knight and the usual Warrior staples. Ninja works well for handling walls and having pretty great stats. It also works with getting Wanghu on the field via Art of Transformation. It's not perfect, but it can fly though the deck faster and even bypass some destruction attempts. Freed seems a bit weird but given how much LIGHT stuff you are using here he can be incredibly useful for alt-removal alongside being another good beater.</p><p>Spells are the usual Trinity, but 3x Smashing Ground means we can right away establish presence while getting rid of big threats. Nobleman, Reinforcement, you know the deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Traps are a ;ittle bit more out there. Light of Intervention + Wanghu is a classic Lock strat, forcing the opponent to either waste their sub-1400 ATK monsters or hold on to them and clog the hand more. Getting this off on a unsuspecting Goat/Chaos Control deck can be crippling given half of their consistency comes from flip monsters and/or floating into things. Transformation seems a bit dodgy but I think it really clicked with the deck and allowed it a ton more flexiablity despite the limitations of the card. It can be easily sided out anyway so I wasn't that bothered.</p><p>Everything else is just the usual, focusing on removal of backrow and monsters when needed to keep the game firmly under your pace.</p><p>Side deck throws in Chaos given the relatively easy synergy between what's being used here. Mobius is a handy backrow killer with solid stats. Some extra traps to focus more on hard negations, pretty basic but strudy cover.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

They also enable you the search off of Isolde, since she doesn't negate the pendulum effect of the monster searched. Isolde's summon from deck is a pretty brutal choke point, but I think this is probably the best version of Infernoble Knights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this deck is to draw at least 2 Igknights to search Sublimation Knight, which equips Squeaknight from deck to make Isolde. Isolde searches another Igknight, which can use its pendulum effect to search IPG later. Use Isolde to summon Ogier from deck, who dumps Turpin to grave. If possible, use Durendal to acquire Ignis Phoenix, scale up and pendulum summon as many monsters as possible. From there it's up to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on your hand, you can use Turpin to help you make Angelica, searching Horn of Olifant, or go into Ignister Prominence, or straight into Baronne or Charles. From there, you can use any monster + Isolde to make Spright Sprind, which dumps Ringowurm from deck. Ringowurm banishes itself to summon a token, allowing you to make any of your synchros, depending on what's still on board. If you have Charles, you can add Divine Sword Phoenix Blade back to hand and equip it to Charles. This lets you activate Turpin's other effect, summoning himself from grave. Overlay him and any level 4 for the Battlin' Boxer Xyz, which searches the Counter Trap and turns Spright Sprind online. Link off the Charles for Charlemagne, giving you a S/T negate. If you have both the Battlin' Boxer counter trap, use his effect to destroy the equipped Charles (unless you control the field spell and can summon Charles out). You need the zones. Use Ogier's effect to equip him from grave.</p><p>At any point in this combo, you can use a second wave of Igknights to search IPG. If you managed to get Ignis Phoenix, this summons an additional tuner from deck (of any level, since it can be any Igknight) and extends your combo dramatically. Summon IPG by banishing anything. Set Horn of Olifant and the Battlin' Boxer Counter Trap, then during End Phase equip anything from grave and Oliver from deck. This gives you a Charlemagne that's untargetable and indestructible (at 3.8k if you equip Phoenix Blade from grave and don't have the field spell) and ends you on a S/T negate in Charlemange, a monster negate in IPG, a monster negate in the counter trap, a pop in Horn of Olifant, a bounce in Spright Sprind, and anything else you managed to get from your synchros (could be Baronne, could be Muddy Mudragon into Mirrorjade, could be Omega). If you happened to draw Morgan that's an extra omni right there too.</p><p>Morgan is to try and provide some protection for Isolde because that's a pretty bad choke point, but if you don't draw the equip to facilitate that, it's still pretty good later because Charlemagne will equip a Noble Arms from grave, turning her online.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The side deck is full of other options I was considering. The Mikanko cards make a pretty good engine with Renaud, allowing you to cut down on the number of equip spells you're running, since you can send just Water Arabesque to summon him. He adds back Water Arabesque, which you equip to summon Ha Re from deck. Search Fire Dance. Summon Renaud back from hand, synchro for Cupid Pitch. Cupid Pitch become level 5, use Fire Dance to summon back Ha Re, synchro for Scarlight and search Performapal Handstandcoon because why not. Pend summon your previously destroyed Igknights, use one + Isolde to dump Ringowurm, Ringowurm banish to summon a token. Token + Scarlight for Dis Pater. Dis Pater summon back Ringowurm. Ringo + Igknight for whatever synchro is applicable (Muddy Mudragon is probably the best in this case. Since you don't have Turpin in grave, you only have access to the Xyz if you were lucky, so Spright Sprind isn't online, meaning you can use Muddy Mudragon + Sprind for Mirrorjade and lose nothing).</p><p>Additional Ringowurms in the main deck probably wouldn't be bad because it's a free tuner SS, but I don't think I can justify it because it's pretty important to open 2 Igknights with this strategy.</p><p>It's too bad the Battlin' Boxer counter trap doesn't negate S/T, so it doesn't protect you from Dark Ruler, but having 2 disruptions + a boss monster that's untargetable &amp; indestructable through Dark Ruler is still pretty good.</p>"

Calling hellfire to America for their actions in WWII . The creators of these card games often aim to emotionally impact players through artwork and storylines; thus, it seems like they are trying to evoke feelings of revenge and justice against American culture by incorporating historical events into their designs. With the release date of Operations Bonfire still uncertain, one must consider how they will choose to play the game. Will they try to act virtuously despite knowing they may not survive or will they seek power to ensure their own safety even at the expense of others? Ultimately, only those living in states involved in Operations Bonfire will experience the full effects of this new update.</span></span></p><p><span>Thanks for reading &gt;..&gt; I do hope you don't enjoyed this at all! </span></p>"

Use Imsemity, Magical Contract Door into Imsemity, Trade-In, or any other draw to get Pharonic Sacophagus.</p><p>2. Use Pharonic Sarcophagus to dump your zombies with useful graveyard effects to also dump your other Horus monsters into the graveyard.</p><p>3. Use three of your Horus monsters to go into Coach King Giant Trainer.</p><p>4. Refill your hand then use your dumped Mezuki to res one level 8 and use the final Horus monster to go into The Zombie Vampire.</p><p>5. Link both The Zombie Vampire and Giantrainer into Vampire Sucker.</p><p>6. After these 3 steps you should have a sizeable number of zombies in your graveyard, use their discard and ressurection effects to go into Barone, Link Vampire Sucker into Apollousa, Synchro Borrelsword dragon, using whatever remaining resources to either Ressurect Hapy or go into additional Synchro's. At the start of your opponents standby phase Use Doomking's effect to ressurect.</p><p>7. You should now have a 3 uses of Appollousa, Barone, Borrelsword, Doomking, and at least Hapy for 6 negates on the board.</p><p>Some tips for the deck Include:</p><p>As long as Sarcophagus remains on the field you have access to 4 level 8 summons every turn. Your negates should be used to protect it.</p><p>Barone's negate should be used on the first non-monster board wipe effect instead of Borreload, as on the following turn Barone can float into one of your level 2 tuners which can then synchro 1 of your 4 horus ressurects per turn to infinitely refresh Barone on the field.</p><p>Foolish Burial should be used on your Ishizu cards that excavate 5 as your likely to hit multiple useful zombies.</p><p>Hapy is generally the Horus monster you want to end on your board as it's effect can add both zombie world and sarcophagus back to your hand should your opponent manage to destroy them.</p><p>This deck has an absolutely insane grind game, the longer the game goes on the more likely you are going to win, so try and stall.</p><p>The horus monsters cannot be ressurected by your mezuki's unless zombie world is up, so try and get a necroworld banshee into the graveyard sooner rather than later.</p>"

Panda+Yajiro,"<p>In the history of Yu-Gi-Oh, Jackpot 7 OTK decks require you to go second. What if I told you that you can also go first with this deck besides going second? Let me show you:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) Draw a lot of cards with Panda and Saryuja or Librarian and Formula until you reach the situation illustrated below. Don't forget to set all three Jackpot 7 cards.</p><p><img class=""centerArticleImg"" src=""https://i.imgur.com/58JywbI.png"" alt="""" width=""1920"" loading=""lazy"" /></p><ul><li>Special Summon Yajiro to the middle via Saryuja. If you summon Yajiro elsewhere, it will be destroyed. Be careful with that.</li><li>Yajiro is here to destroy everything within his sight while trying to catch up any monster you are trying to summon. It's the main idea for this deck.</li><li>If you are out of summoning charges with Panda, use ""Pot of Avarice"".</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) Play Yajiro &gt;&gt;&gt; Shien's Spy combo to place him into the 1st column. There, you can do this in order:</p><ul><li>Panda &gt;&gt;&gt; Monster into 5th column &gt;&gt;&gt; Yajiro moves to 2nd column &gt;&gt;&gt; First Jackpot 7 destroyed!</li><li>Imduk into 4th column by using 5th column monster &gt;&gt;&gt; Yajiro moves to 3rd column &gt;&gt;&gt; Second Jackpot 7 destroyed!</li><li>Panda &gt;&gt;&gt; Monster into 4th/5th column &gt;&gt;&gt; Yajiro moves to 4th column &gt;&gt;&gt; Third Jackpot 7 destroyed!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) Congratulations, you win the game!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As always, here are the tips for saving up some SR and UR points:</p><p>- ""Into the Void"" can be found within ""The Infinite Void"" Secret Pack to save 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Pot of Avarice"" can be collected by purchasing ""Re-Contact Universe"" deck. 90 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Jackpot 7"" can be found within ""Legacy Pack"". I hope you really hit the jackpot, where you can save up to 90 SR!</p><p>- ""Wonder Wand"" and ""Spellbook of Knowledge"" can be collected by purchasing ""Spellbook of Prophecy"" deck. 120 SR saved and you can try a new deck!</p><p>- ""Moray of Avarice"" can be unlocked through timed selection pack called ""The Synchronized Cosmoc"". As of this writing, if you are willing to spend gems to save 30 UR, this is your chance.</p><p>- ""Link Spider"", ""Link Bound"" and LAN are given for free, if you've picked ""Link Generation"". Thus, 90 SR is saved!</p><p>- ""Formula Synchron"" isn't really needed, if you are low on SR. Though it can be unlocked by opening ""Stardust Ties"" Secret Pack, Saryuja and other Link monsters can pick targets to refill GY for ""Pot of Avarice"" more than enough. 90 SR saved!</p><p>- ""T.G. Hyper Librarian"" can be found within ""Futuristic Creatures"" Secret Pack to save 30 UR. However, you don't need to bother with him at all, if you don't want to spend SR on ""Formula Synchron"".</p><p>- ""Number 60: Dugares the Timeless"" can be found within ""Number Recall"" Secret Pack. If you play Saryuja &gt;&gt;&gt; Monk &gt;&gt;&gt; Panda combo and target Monk+Panda to XYZ summon him, you can draw two more cards. Number 60 is really good card to thin your deck but you don't have to spend 30 SR on him, if you are low on SR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in total, you can save up to 600 SR and 60 UR, if you are willing to spend some gems. Other SR and UR cards I didn't mention are essential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's all for this one. Let me know if you have any questions and have fun in Master Duel!</p>"

Furthermore, while this version was definitely never optimal anyway the fact you can't get any use out of Sprind means it's considerbly worse in comparison than it used to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Bystials also are quite detrimental as they can just run over both Anubis &amp; Rai-Oh wich is why i decided to go for Avramax over Goddess to try and mitigate that issue. At least Bystials can be utilized by this deck itself rather well and with Jet &amp; Blue being semi limited you pretty much have the exact space to run all the good ones.</p><p>I decided to go for only Double Cross without Smashers as i think the card is honestly quite a bit better and i didn't really run into situations were i missed Smashers.</p><p>Exciton is something i wanted to try as Tear isn't the only thing on ladder anymore atm and it sounded pretty cracked going 2nd. Not sure if replacing Dugares for it is actually worth it tho.</p>"
