Five months ago Deer Note wasn't even in Master Duel and Dante was in everyones ED to unbrick bad hands with Uni and E-Tele. Now? Zombies can mill a sixty card deck without grass, spam every lvl 8 and 10 synchro possible, they can scythe lock, have a floodgate field spell that can burden the best deck in the meta, and stops the second best deck, Floowandereeze, altogether. All this while no longer getting locked into zombies. Honestly this deck has become comparable to Adamancipators. Where Adamancipators still has less potential to brick an opening, the end board zombies can make deprecates on Adamacipators as a deck that utilizes a monster type rather than an archetype. You can do anything. Rarely have I not had all three mezuki in grave along with changshi, Chaos Ruler and Doomking. Put whatever you want in the Extra Deck, it doesn't matter, if it is generic and good (or not), zombies will make it. Accesscode, Apollousa, Underworld Goddess, Dweller, Bagooska, Baronne, Chengying, Elf; people are doing Stardust Dragon lines because they can. I know Tearlaments ARE the format, but I would still give zombies a try because they have never been so powerful.</p><p>With all that said, this is my deck! It could be 60 cards, and it could play more handtraps and it could even play branded. That is the point of zombies: pure creative liberty. My deck is built to mill; I can get through a turn and end with 6 cards in main and 4 in Extra. I don't play handtraps because I like to see how far I can take a deck with it's own power, and that means going first and praying they don't have hand traps, which in tear format means I have to watch out for an Imperm and a DD Crow which is more than doable.</p><p>I do not have enough monster zones, I often have to decide what would be the best end board I can make with only six monsters on it. Thanks to Elf, mezuki, and this decks amazing ability to spam lvl 8 monsters, Mad Mauler is the MVP. Make a lvl 10 synchro, bring back Chaos Ruler from the graveyard, bring back Mauler using elf, make another lvl 10 synchro, target one of those synchros with Mauler and summon Red-Eyes, to resummon that lvl 10 in the GY on your opponents turn. End Boards look like, Elf, Red-Eyes, Baronne, Chengying, Doomking, and Rulkallos. Sometimes I will hold off on the Red-Eyes effect to see what would be better, a Chengying, a Sycthe lock, or a second Doomking depending on how they respond to the first one. Sometimes you even have Superpoly or can send your Tears back with a shuffler only to mill again with Merrli and summon Dragostepelia. Anything, anything, anything you want do you can do with this deck, so start labbing because it has never been a better time to mill with zombies!</p>"

The list has kinda changed since last time I posted the first draft but with some changes in the extra deck and and some changes to non-engine cards as well as the side deck. I took out droll and gamma for ash and bystials as well as I put D barrier in the side because they limited gamma, banned super heavy scarecrow, limited purely delicous. You can play droll if you want still if you feel you need it but I believe thats up to you for decide. I chose ash, bystials and D barrier because I am asumming more people will play Branded and Striker since Engane got semi limited and Multi role became unlimited. Ash hits Branded fusion of course and bystials hit the archetype in general which is why I added them in as well as Labrynth. Dimensional barrier is reall good agaisnt Branded and even Kash shutting them off of XYZ, though Kashtira will probably still be the best deck. However I have thought about playing Belle in either the main or side because in testing I rn into alot of bytsials that would banish Visas in GY which hurts alot sincehe is the heart and soul of the deck. I believe we are in a bystial format so be aware of that going forward so be prepared. Another card I thought about playing was destrudo which is another card to add off of Magnamut but I will test more with it and come back with an updated deck if it works. In the extra deck I added IP Masquerena and Underworld goddess. I found myslef having a hard time outing chaos angel going first so that is why I put Underworld goddess and IP was added as just a more easy way to make unicorn if needed. You can play Accesscode if you want which isnt a bad idea but I would need to test more with it and see if it works well.</p>"

I tried to put in sakitama because its easy to summon and easy to get into alembertian or other link cyberse monsters to extend or start your plays. I added the micro coder package to add an extra form of distruption if you end up going into heatsoul. In the extra deck Im using Dark Fluid becuase of how versatile it is with I:P after you go first, and you can also use Dark Fluid plus Nabla if yuo start to go into time (I got this idea from ""The Duelist Cypher"" on youtube, I encourage you to watch his videos because of how entertaining they are). Side deck s pretty simple, Anti-Spell/Sekka for labrynth, DRNM for combo decks, belle for albaz if they try to lock you out, honestly you can switch the evenly matched for anything you like.&nbsp;</p>"

Using no meta cards, this deck relies entirely on the luck of a coin flip! If you call right, pop a card! If you call wrong, well, lets talk about that later!</p><p>Use the monstrous, mechanical dragons known as Desperado Barrel Dragon, Barrel Dragon and Blowback Dragon to blast your opponents cards off the board, but remember, you must believe in your coin to get you the best hits! Even if you do get a tripe Tails, you can use Proton Blast in the GY to make all your results Heads. It's not cheating if it's written on the card!</p><p>Other than the Barrel Dragons, you also have Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler, who will be a 4000 ATK beatstick once you get three monsters on the field, flip a coin and see what upgrade you can get on him! Alongside Arcana, you also have JINZO The Machine Menace, alongside his trusty sidekick Returner. Jinzo The Machine Menance will special summon himself as a 2400 ATK monster while a trap is in the GY or face up on the field (not a Quick Effect). He can whenever tribute himself to rid all traps on the field and summon Returner, who when destroyed will summon Machine Menace again from the GY, but only for a turn, so use him wisely!</p><p>You also have cards like BM-4 Spider who can destroy an opponents monster and inflict burn damage, along with the old Blast Sphere that can do similar work. The mini Twin-Barrel Dragon can pop a card if it tosses two Heads. Keeper and Prisma help to get your Gatling Dragon on the field, Keeper can also summon a Barrel Dragon or Blowback from the Deck, but only in facedown defence position, flip him back up the next turn to activate his effect! Fusion Deployment is a free Barrel or Blowback Dragon from the Deck. Heavy Metal Raiders will upgrade your Barrel Dragons considerably, protecting them and boosting their ATK, while also summoning more Dark Machines! Limiter Removal will double your Barrel Dragons up to 5600 ATK (not permanent).&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror Force is a classic way of protecting your board, and Call of The Haunted is yet another classic that brings back anything from the GY!</p><p>This isn't a great deck, but it is fun and nostalgic. Good luck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

(That's the reason you run 1 veiler, 1 ogre, and 1 evenly matched)</p><p>Q: No Iblee in main deck?</p><p>A: iblee is a very easy card to out, even if your oppenent doesn't have a link 1 they'll just normal summon a monster then go into phoneix (because everyone and there grandmas running it). But, I do believe it is worthy to side if your going up against lots of decks that don't want to give up there normal summon (purrely sometimes), can't normal summon (kashtira most of the time atleast), or decks that just don't want to special summon (floowandereeze). I would compare this card to ra's disciple in branded (which nobody runs emphasizing my point)</p>"

Theory was, Crystal beasts also use a lot of spells, which help trigger the second effect of your sky strikers, they also have a lot of good trap cards for countering the opponent, and as well as, can be *crystalised* to empty your main monster zone, to use sky striker spells. Also, helps for making bagooska if needed, and , since you mainly use links...you see what I mean.</p><p>Flaws; You have to run the brick of rainbowdragon, which, if you watched the replay , you know.

Most combos require two cards to get started, requiring a Mannadium ball + Starfrost himself - so this deck is maxed out on finding these two cards as much as possible. With this current iteration of the deck, if this combination isn't present in your hand, boards will be suboptimal or non-existent (essentially you bricked).&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">A small hero engine is included with 3 ""A Hero Lives"" and 2 ""Elemental Hero Prisma."" Prisma is extremely useful in this deck representing about two resources upon summon, being able to foolish burial Visas Starfrost (material for Astraloud) and act as Visas on-field, turning on your Mannadium monster's special summon. Since he is ""Visas Starfrost"" on-field,you can also link him off to summon Scareclaw Light-Heart, further enabling your plays.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">9 slots are saved for staple cards, and they are the most impactful handtraps of the meta, Ash Blossom (counters Branded and Labrynth), Droll (counters Mannadium and PUNK Gold Pride) and Impermanence is very versatile in every situation. These 9 slots can be exchanged with side deck cards, allowing your deck to be ready for different match-ups.&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof""><div><span class=""ContentPasted9"">This deck's limiting factor is consistency. It faces the problem that a similar older combo deck had, Virtual World. It needed combo pieces to be present in hand or else you've straight up bricked. There aren't any ""one card starters"" in this deck like Branded Fusion, Mathmech Circular or Weclome Labrynth - you'll need at least two combo pieces, and three is optimal. This problem will soon be fixed (I think) with the upcoming DUNE support. However with CYAC, this deck suffers consistency issues, leaving it prone to bricking and having less room in-deck for staple cards.&nbsp;</span></div></div><div class=""elementToProof""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></span><br /></strong></div><div><strong class=""ContentPasted0""><span><strong class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">&nbsp;</strong></span></strong></div><div class=""elementToProof""><span class=""ContentPasted0""><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted1"">The strategy for Mannadium is straightforward (summon level 10 synchros + 3 mat Apollousa) while combos are linear, despite hands being different.

You also have materials in GY next turn to create a Astraloud and if Dis Pater survives until next turn, he can summon Riumheart from banished pile to as follow-up to get more resources from deck. What makes this board extra special&nbsp; is that it can withstand a Dark Ruler no More/Forbidden Droplet since Reframing is a backrow omni-negate.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The optimal deck's endboard is an extremely potent powerhouse that all decks would be hard-pressed to deal with. Depending on the cards in-hand and whatever interruptions your opponent has, your resulting endboard from this combo vary in power, depending on how much you bricked and how many times you've been interrupted.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This deck can also sustain being hit by several handtraps and keep on comboing, since it offers many extenders and different lines of play.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Going second, this deck naturally breaks boards with Primitive Planet Reichphobia, Astraloud, Baronne and Chaos Angel removing cards. However, as it combos, the strategy is vulnerable to interruption, preferring to go first. The good news is that the Mannadium ""ball"" combo pieces float (not once per turn btw) when they are destroyed, so you can keep on going if your opponent opts to destroy them.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span class=""ContentPasted10"">Mannadium can easily churn out over 9000ATK on board with at least 4 removals requiring minimal investment. When you've baited out all their interruptions going for the regular combo, you can pivot your strategy for the Astraloud + Accesscode OTK. First Link two monsters for Cross-Sheep on board. Contact fuse Visas Starfrost + Visas Clone in GY for Astraloud (1 pop) to a zone Cross-Sheep is pointing to so you can summon another monster from the GY. Link Cross-Sheep + another monster for Knightmare Unicorn (1 spin). Link Knightmare Unicorn + monster for Accesscode Talker (2 pops). And there we have it, 4 removals and over 9000ATK on board for OTK!</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div></div><div class=""ContentPasted0"">&nbsp;</div></div><div><div><div><span><span><strong><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">GENERAL TIPS</span></strong></span></span></div><div><div class=""elementToProof""><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">&nbsp;</span></span></span></div><div class=""elementToProof""><ul data-editing-info=""{&quot;orderedStyleType&quot;:1,&quot;unorderedStyleType&quot;:1}""><li><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">As you combo, be aware of the zones you're summoning in, or else you may stop your combo in it's tracks! For Light-Heart, keep the monster zone below it empty, so you can summon Reichheart below it.

While it is possible to play through these cards if your starting hand is strong, your board will be weaker. An option to use for this is 3 Crossout Designator + 1 of each handtrap to stop them.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">An interesting variant of the deck is True King version, where level 9s summon themselves from hand by destroying your Mannadium ""balls,"" triggering both of their effects!

Both archetypes hold immense synergy with each other, so I may begin testing the True King variant for their viability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span class=""ContentPasted0 ContentPasted3 ContentPasted5"">Is your combo stopped by a pesky floodgate?

The playstyle is a straightforward combo with little variance. I find that there is no uniqueness with this deck, since its only used as an engine to turbo out generic boss monsters, (Baronne, Apollousa, Dis Pater, etc.) rather than something in-archetype. Even their iconic level 10 boss synchro, Mannadium Prime-Heart is abandoned in favour of more competitive level 10s! With my complaints being said, I believe the next wave of support from DUNE will give this deck an actual personality and identity with ""Visas Amritara."" When that buster blade wielding badass is released, Mannadium will be more thematic, rather than merely being a shell to summon generic boss monsters. This deck is only getting stronger with future support!&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof"">In honour of the inferior Mannadium Prime-Heart who will never be competitively viable (card designers what are you thinking?!), here is the infamous Mannadium copy-pasta, ran through the ""OwOifier:""</div><div class=""elementToProof"">&nbsp;</div><div class=""elementToProof ContentPasted6""><em>""Mannadium Pwime-Heawt has a speciaw defensive abiwity thawt stops youw opponent fwom tawgeting iwt with cawd effects.

These cards have the main advantages: they greatly <strong>increase the consistency</strong> of the deck and you can <strong>access Baronne de Fleur</strong> easily. The third big application is that you <strong>have more ways to play after opponent interactions</strong> which is a weakness of Dinosaur because the deck has a lot of normal summons and few <strong>hand extenders</strong> and Xeno Meteors is an exceptional extender to keep playing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My intention when playing Dinosaur after the <strong>Miscellaneousaurus limitation</strong> has always been to continue <strong>playing second</strong> because his cards are not good against <strong>hand traps going first</strong> and when necessary to go first I can make the same end board that the deck alone has always been able to to do which is <strong>Evolzar Dolkka as the first extra deck monster protecting the rest of your turn</strong> and then <strong>Tyranno + Omega to return Miscellaneousaurus</strong> to the GY as a follow up which is the exact opposite of what most people do in the deck which is fill up the <strong>deck of unnecessary bricks</strong> to make an end board that when it passes it makes <strong>5 to 6 negates and without any follow up</strong> which means that if you take Dark Ruler No More and the opponent clears the field with AA-Zeus for example you automatically lose the game on the way back.</p><p>If you intend to <strong>play with a Dice Roll</strong> deck with <strong>no space for tech cards</strong>, which uses a <strong>lot of horrible brick</strong>, it makes a combo that <strong>loses to all the hand traps</strong> in the game, which <strong>lock you into specific monsters in the extra deck</strong> that make your options scarce and bad when you go second and there's <strong>no follow up</strong> so that's what you'll find and get frustrated trying to play and lose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if you want a deck with <strong>consistency, versatility and power</strong> then this is the version of Dinosaur that I recommend using because now the deck has so <strong>much consistency</strong> that your starting hands are very redundant if the deck has 40 cards besides you <strong>have no room for tech cards</strong> like hand traps. So it's best to increase to <strong>60 cards and use Small World</strong> to increase starting hand combinations and always <strong>choose to go second</strong> so you can get the best combinations of blind second cards as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>extra deck is standard</strong> for what I consider to be the right way to play Dinosaur which is to focus on Xyz. The only big change you can do is to <strong>test it and remove the Psyframe engine from the main deck and Lambda</strong> because after the banlist in a <strong>mediocre way limits Gamma</strong> it is a card that can be cut without difficulties from the decklist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>////////////////////////////////////</p><p>Below I'll leave some <strong>very basic combos in the right and simple way to play with the new cards</strong> that Baronne de Fleur has access to:</p><p>Remember that Oviraptor + Baby = Oviraptor + Miscellaneousaurus = Miscellaneousaurus + Baby = Archosaur + Baby</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-50167039</p><p><strong>COMBO 1</strong>: Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus (Play Around Hand Traps)</p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Dolkka + Omega + Lambda</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-50167148</p><p><strong>COMBO 2</strong>: Ground Xeno + Babycerasaurus</p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Baronne de Fleur + Omega + Lambda</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=813757-50167479</p><p><strong>COMBO 3</strong>: Lost World + Ground Xeno + Babycerasaurus (Full Combo Play Around Nibiru)</p><p>Gamestate: Tyranno + Dolkka + Baronne de Fleur + Omega + Lambda</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had even made a <strong>version with Ogdoadic</strong> that also talks about the <strong>right and detailed way to use this new engine</strong>. The version with Ogdoadic is more for fun but it was <strong>created with the aim of solving Dinosaur's biggest problem: how sensitive the deck is to hand traps when it goes first</strong>. In this version you have <strong>more ways to continue playing after taking hand traps and the follow ups are the best possible</strong> so I leave below the link of this version for those who are interested in knowing:</p><p>https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/scrap-dino-transcendrake-apr23-format-323446</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p>The <strong>next ""evolution"" of the Dinosaur deck</strong> will be <strong>Kaitoptera with Horned Saurus</strong>. These cards basically <strong>replace Giant Rex</strong> in the deck and allow you to <strong>access Lost World every turn plus you have Polymerization available</strong> either to make Guardian Chimera or to be a discard of Link Knightmare. Until then, this is the best way to use Dinosaur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Disregard the side deck because, like the tech cards I use in the main deck, you can adapt to the reality of the competitive format or where you play.</p><p>////////////////////////////////////////////</p>"

And other spice","<p><em>A kinda Budget build for Branded Despia</em></p><p>I have Quem, but if you don't have it's not essential to play. If you have Cartesia you definitely want to switch Ecclesia for her.&nbsp;</p><p>We play Winda, cause it's really easy to do with Lubellion and the only Shaddoll target that's in the deck isn't useless cause you can have a draw by discarding it (Branded Opening, Lubellion's cost, Branded Fusion...).</p><p>The main line of play to use in a good way Winda is to have Branded Fusion and Branded In Red. We send from deck Albaz and Shaddoll Beast and we summon Lubellion with this. Discard for Lubellion's cost (chain 1). Then you chain Branded In Red (chain 2) taking Albaz from GY and you have to make Mirrorjade by using Albaz from hand and Lubellion from Field. And then Lubellion is going to shuffle itself and Beast into the deck to make Winda. With this we will end with Mirrorjade and Winda <em>(Notes: that's not the main line of play for the deck, but surely it's a good one. Other thing, this combo is possible to do even under Shifter)</em></p><p>The Shaddoll name it's for sure a brick if drawn in first hand or by top deck, but we have plenty of ways to use it as a cost for cards to use his effect to draw or as a fusion material, considering that Winda only requests a Dark Monster other than the Shaddoll one, and our deck is mostly composed by Dark Monsters</p><p>But maybe there's another question: why Ecclesia tho? I chose to play Ecclesia cause she can cheat out Albaz from deck during the opponent's turn, and you'll able to do his effect by stealing a opponent's monster.</p><p>The best way we want to use Ecclesia it's by using Branded Opening in the opponent's Standby Phase, and summon Quem with that. With Quem you can send Ecclesia from deck to GY, and with her second effect you'll summon Ecclesia too, that will send herself to GY and Special Summon Albaz (that's more easy if you actually try that instead of reading the explanation lol)</p><p><em>(Note: this combo isn't possible to do under Shifter)</em></p><p><strong>Edge Imp Engine</strong>: I personally love to play it for the fact that is a way to play after an Ash on BraFu and let you plus</p><p><strong>Allure Of Darkness</strong>: we like to have a good amount of cards in hand to do our stuff, and the synergy with Mercurier and Tragedy it's fantastic</p><p>Other spice, the <strong>Borreload fusion</strong> (I refuse to write the whole name). It's a good target for Albaz's effect, Branded in Red or Lubellion. And he pops an opponent card. Remember you can dodge the destruction of out Fusions by Branded Opening effect in the GY</p><p>Side is pretty standard, I thought about playing <strong>Dimension Shifter</strong>,but I have to find some space. Maybe you can cut the Dark Ruler No More, but we have to see how the meta will go. You can even play <strong>Enemy Controller or Forbidden Chalice in the side deck</strong>, is all about what you like to play and how the format goes. Advice a second copy of <strong>Masquerade</strong> for winning at the time. But I repeat, that's a personal choice</p><p>We don't play the new Albion that locks with the Gimmick Puppet for two reasons: Albion it's a pricey card (even Quem is pricey, but you can take her out from the deck. Instead Albion is the only way to do the lock) and I really don't like the lock, and Winda it's a good way to lock too</p><p>Last thing I swear: if you have Cartesia play her, but I'm broke. Same discourse with Super Polymerization (you can play three Spoly by cutting Ash and another card)</p><p>Much love, hope I explained in a decent way. Ask if you need, I'll try to answer</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

In my main, I love versatile cards that work well 1st or 2nd. Examples of these are Jowgen and Moon Mirror Shield. When side decking, I only run a couple of additional ""going 1st"" floodgate options, Summon Limit and TCBOO. I used to run 2-3 copies of Dark Bribe to protect my board, but I've recently dropped the card in lieu of running more ""going 2nd"" cards in the side. All of my ""going 2nd"" cards are board-breakers. No hand traps whatsoever. I feel like hand traps are terrible in Stun. Most meta players can play around 1 or 2 hand traps, and you, as the Stun player have now depleted your hand of 1 to 2 cards just for the sake of mildly slowing them down. I prefer to let them over-extend, build a big board, and break it.<br /><br />Oh, and Yata Garasu ends up being the MVP pretty frequently. One of my biggest fears as a Stun player is my opponent drawing ""the out"". However....you can't draw ""the out"" if you can't draw at all....</p>"

I used to run it without maxx c and superpoly, but I found that it struggled going second so I added them.&nbsp;</p><p>The Starving Venome, Predaplant and Mudragon are for the superpoly, but can be made using Tear fusion (except the Starving which can only be made using superpoly).</p><p>An ideal combo would be milling 9 cards using the PUNK engine, which activates the Tear engine to mill another 8. If you mill the Ishizu cards thats a further 10 mill so that's 26 cards milled in total without grass.</p><p>Check out the YT video for gameplay and the ideal first turn board.</p><p>Hope you like it.</p>"

Easy to summon, with an extender effect (would be in the main deck if it was searchable and not a hard once per turn).</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Number 39: Utopia &amp; S39 Utopia the Lightning: Generic Rank 4 that can rank up into Lightning. Just a 5000 ATK beatstick if needed.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Tornado Dragon: Excellent backrow removal in a generic Rank 4. If Shi En and Savage aren't enough anti-backrow, this card is more than enough.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Number 101: Silent Honor ARK: Problematic card removal, similar purpose to Castel. Generic Rank 4.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Leviair the Sea Dragon: Rank 3 extender. Revive any of your Secret Six Samurai monsters (that banish themselves from the GY as protection) or whoever you banished with Hatsume effect.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(1)Called by the Grave: This is your only hope against Ash or Droll if you don't have any omni- negates on board. Stuns hurt this deck badly.</p><p dir=""ltr"">(3)Musakani Magatama: 100% tech card/side deck option.

Contains all cards that Mako used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not much is known about his first deck, but I believe it didn't change much from his Battle City one.</p><p>But it is clear that, this early on, ""Kairiyu-Shin"" (Leviathan) was his ace card.</p><p>Mako probably also had Legendary Fisherman and Fortress Whale around this time, they just weren't shown. His Tornado Wall strategy would probably be too much during this era, so let's just give him that in Battle City.</p><p>Notice that, some of the monster choices, are there because of Fortress Whale's materials on the games (I went for that approach for Duelist Kingdom Decks). They also heavily implied that he has a Raigeki in the deck, especially in the games (which I also checked and used to build this deck - I'm looking at you Duel Monsters 1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His tactic against Yugi (on his first duel) was mostly just hiding his monsters underwater for a surprise Sea Stealth Attack (but for a supposed fair duelist, he wasn't doing much differently than Panik, so why wasn't he called out?).</p><p>And for those saying that the ""Attack the Moon!"" was bs in this Duel, you might also try to remember how Yugi's Equip Spell indirectly raised the tides (that was one weird backfire, but alright). Yugi finished the Duel with Curse of Dragon AND Burning Land, which destroys all Field Spell cards - getting rid of Umi, so it wasn't totally out-of-nowhere, right? Well I'd like to believe that but we already know how Duelist Kingdom rules were something else...</p><p>I added those 2 newer cards to the Side Deck in nod to his Duel with Yugi. They were made to refference it and I think they're honestly really cool.</p>"

Contains all cards that he used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This guy has several names - he was a ventriloquist in the manga, but in the anime he's more of a creepy clown.</p><p>He appeared once just to never return ever again. Mind Crush really did a number on him.</p><p>This is a slightly better version of the Deck that Kaiba used against Yugi (on their first Duel from the anime), all with some extras included. Think that you can spot all cards that seem out of place in this Deck? There should be, at least, 3 of them... they mostly are just taking the place of cards that are to be first revealed in this season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This character was used a few times in the early games and it's honestly really neat not seeing him as completely forgotten.</p><p>The Side Deck contains cards that were drops from him in the games. I thought that it would be a cool thing to add.</p><p>Now, Kaiba at this point of the story was in a coma, that's why its Deck was stolen easily, but next time Kaiba gets his hands on the Deck, he's got some surprises up his sleeve...</p>"

Contains all cards that Bonz used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bonz, while known to use a Zombie Deck, used some sort of regular monsters with a catch - he revives them back up again as Zombies.</p><p>But ""Call of the Haunted"" was given to him by Bandith Keith, so it kinda leaves us thinking... what was he using before that? A bunch of ghost monsters? The Deck he runs in WC2004 is pretty funny because he just runs something else entirely, so it's fun to think about it.</p><p>For the sake of being a bit more close to the anime (and his first duel), I gave him 3 ""Call of the Haunted"".</p><p>In the Side Deck you can find the first Ritual monster (which is also a Zombie) ""Dokuroraider"". Decided to give him that because, in Duelist Kingdom, Rituals were used quite a few times. I'm also going for the Forbidden Memories Rules and didn't put it in the Main Deck (we don't really see them have the Ritual monsters in hand anyway, the rules for Rituals were still pretty hazy back then).</p><p>The 3 iconic Low-Level 0 Defense Normal monsters should be put in the Side Deck, as they were more like transformations than actual cards. The ones they were originally (Crawling Dragon, Zanki and Dream Clown) are all in the Main Deck, however.</p><p>Any weak Normal monsters could be part of his previous Deck (the Ghost Deck), as they're on theme.

Contains all cards that PaniK used in the anime in that season.</p><p>Duelist Kingdom has different rules than the current ones (those would only take place in Battle City), so duelists are able to summon high level monsters for no tributes. This deck was made for fun and wasn't meant for being competitive (there was, however, an attempt to do it considering their decks and rules of that arc and their universe).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think most of us remember this guy because of his monsters' weird statlines. Let's hope that we can get retrains of such cards now that the Illusionist type has finally been announced.</p><p>There always seems to be something weird with his Deck, as he runs the most useless monsters ever.</p><p>And then Castle of Dark Illusions had its effect changed to Zombies??? What a disservice.</p><p>You can battle him on Legacy of Duelist and Nightmare Troubadour (he was pretty menacing here, with a Shadow Game and all) but his Decks were always trash, I can't believe he beat Mai.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, added a few monsters that are Fusion Materials for his Fusion monsters and added a few Rituals (seems like everyone almost goes to a consensus that he'd run 1 or more of such Ritual monsters).</p><p>""Dust Barrier"" is really similar to one of the effects of the ""Castle of Dark Illusions"" in the anime and ""Swords of Concealing Light"" is a good rival for ""Swords of Revealing Light"", that Yugi used to reveal his monsters (""Dark Mirror Force"" also has this logic behind it).</p><p>In the Side Deck, there's the Ritual Monsters (since Ritual Summoning in the anime didn't really show the Ritual monster in the Hand, so they're probably like Forbidden Memories) and some burn cards (representing his attempt to burn Yugi alive after losing). ""Ultimate Obedient Fiend"" just looks like a card he'd definitely use, but I'm not sure how that would go in the anime, since he has more ATK power than Blue-Eyes and wasn't even meantioned once (a missed opportunity I'd say).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

I'll be treating Ritual monsters as the ones from Forbidden Memories too (and not having them as Main Deck cards).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Final Boss of Duelist Kingdom and very memorable villain.</p><p>There's a few of cards that Pegasus owns that don't exist at the time of writing this. I substituted the following cards:</p><p>- Mermaid's Tear -&gt; Spellbinding Circle</p><p>- Eye of Deception -&gt; Change of Heart</p><p>- Magic Neutralizing Force -&gt; Imperial Order</p><p>- Negative Energy -&gt; (deppending on the situation, Megamorph or Reverse Trap)</p><p>- Prophecy -&gt; Confiscation (Pegasus can see the opponent's hand anyway)</p><p>- Trap Displacement -&gt; (One of the Mirror trap cards)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the Deck seems a bit too different than usual, that's because ""Toon World"" was different in the anime and it could turn other monsters into Toons (not something that already exists). There's a few cards that are not known in his Deck, but due to them having Toon versions, we could imagine that he also has them in the Deck (""Toon Masked Sorcerer"" and ""Toon Cannon Soldier"").</p><p>I also added those 3 Side Deck cards for flexing (you know which ones I'm talking about), he is the creator of the game, afterall.</p><p>Strange deck indeed, it's not what is usually seen for him, but I tried to make it more like Duelist Kingdom this time. And Pegasus is strange, so it fits in my opinion. For a proper playable deck for him and more in touch with what he usually uses in the games, perhaps I'll do it for later seasons...</p><p>This was all really fun to make, but it sure took a lot of time.</p><p>I'll be doing more in a near future perhaps :))</p>"

When piloting this deck, there are two key factors you must always keep in mind: cost and effect. Every hand you draw should have playability, meaning you should be able to make meaningful moves regardless of the initial cards you receive.</p><p>For your side deck, it's essential to include cards like ""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"" to counter your biggest threats, such as ""Abyss Dweller"" and other similar cards. Additionally, ""Chaos Hunter"" is an unfortunate but necessary inclusion to combat certain banish strategies that may pose a challenge. It's worth noting that ""Chaos Hunter"" can be brought back to the field using ""Muckraker,"" providing additional utility.</p><p>Regarding the Fiend lock, it shouldn't be a significant issue since both ""Kaleido Heart"" and ""Grapha"" are Fiends themselves. This synergy allows for strong plays and interactions within the deck.</p><p>In your side deck, include cards like 'Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries' to counter major threats such as 'Abyss Dweller.' Additionally, 'Chaos Hunter' is vital against banish strategies, despite its drawbacks. 'Chaos Hunter' can be revived using 'Muckraker,' adding versatility to your plays.</p><p>The Fiend lock shouldn't be problematic since both 'Kaleido Heart' and 'Grapha' are Fiends themselves, enabling strong synergy and interactions within the deck.</p><p>When side decking, consider removing 1 'Eldlich,' 1 'Bear,' and 1 'Big Welcome' to optimize your strategy.""</p><p>update: This is my TCG version of the deck I previously mentioned, which operates identically to the OCG version with a few key differences. In the OCG, there's a card called 'New World Formation' that adds recursion, providing an advantage not yet available in the TCG. However, the TCG version has access to better options like 'Gura Wings' and 'Toadally Awesome,' which can enhance your plays. As newer cards are released, I will update the deck list accordingly. If you have the extra funds to spare, you could consider adding a 'Kashira Fenrir' package instead of 'Chaos Hunter.' However, I decided to stick with 'Chaos Hunter' due to the prevalence of 'Bystials' in the current meta. I welcome any suggestions or ideas you may have, so please feel free to leave a comment.

This was made the morning the new pack released, so definitely suboptimal in a lot of ways. Regardless, I do believe this is the best type of Dragonmaid deck you can make. The Bystial package just has a lot of useful synergies with Dragonmaid that I believe are worth exploring. Without any further ado, let's get into it.</p><p>Branded:</p><ul><li>3x Albaz to make sure Branded Fusion is online at basically all times.</li><li>3x Branded Fusion to make said BraFu targets.</li><li>1x Springans Kitt for a Rindbrumm target and a BraFu searcher.</li><li>1x Branded Retribution to dump with Saronir, might consider replacing if I can find a better thing to dump after Bystial Lubellion is put into the GY.</li><li>1x Cartesia, because I don't want to spend the UR dust on extra copies right now. Really good card, walking Polymerization that adds herself back to the hand from grave if you dumped a Fusion in the grave that turn.</li></ul><p>Bystial:</p><ul><li>1x Magnumhut because he's limited. Run as many copies as legally allowed, this guy is by far the best Bystial for this strategy.</li><li>2x Saronir and 2x Baldrake, since I need a decent amount of Bystials for this strategy in general. Both have useful effects, though I haven't procced Baldrake in a duel yet.</li><li>1x Druiswurm because it's limited. I'd probably run a ratio of something like 3x Magnumhut, 2x Druiswurm, 1x each of Saronir and Baldrake if it were up to me, but I sadly don't control the banlist.</li><li>1x Lubellion. More are worth considering, he replaces himself with a usable Bystial if you draw him, but I don't want to spend the UR dust on the extra copies yet.</li><li>1x Branded Regained and 1x Branded Beast as targets for Lubellion. Regained gives a lot of resource accumulation, and Beast gives proactive disruption.</li></ul><p>Dragonmaid:</p><ul><li>3x Chamber, because she's literally the best Dragonmaid gameplay-wise (cutest is Laundry, but she really doesn't fit into this specific deck).</li><li>2x Parlor because I wanted a few extra Dragonmaids to access Sheou better. I... might end up cutting her, as I have been bricking on Parlor a lot. That said, definitely the next best option to use after Chamber.</li><li>1x Changeover to make Sheou, but can also be used to make the fusion Lubellion and any other Dragon fusion monster in the deck.</li><li>1x Hospitality mostly because. Another card I might cut, as it just doesn't do enough TBH. We're not nearly as NS reliant in this build as regular Dragonmaid, since we have so many different playmakers between the Bystial and Branded engines.</li><li>2x Tidying. Just a generally good trap in Dragon decks, both disruption and a way to get another body onto the field.</li></ul><p>Rest of the Main Deck is just various staples and generic cards, not really an interesting discussion there. Fusion Deployment can be run at however many copies you desire, it summons Cartesia or Albaz straight from deck for basically no cost beyond a Fusion lock for the turn.</p><p>Extra Deck:</p><ul><li>Lubellion, Albion, Mirrorjade are basically standard for any deck using the Branded engine, so I won't bother reiterating the most basic combo of the archetype.</li><li>Alba-lenatus is a hate crime against Dragon Link, so of course I run it. Also good to summon off Lubellion if you have a bunch of dragons in grave you'd rather have in your deck, though this ain't really the deck for that. Usually just the second thing you'd use as Mirrorjade ammo after Albion though.</li><li>Rindbrumm is an Albaz target to finally kill Floo, and also your other thing to summon off BraFu. It also gives Branded a negate, which is really appreciated even if I wish it was a Spell/Trap negate.</li><li>1x Sheou and 2x House for Dragonmaid stuff. Gives you an omni, you can use the Bystials as material for Sheou, you probably know how this works if you've ever played Dragonmaid.</li><li>Garura, Starving Venom, and Mudragon are Super Poly targets. I'd argue Starving Venom is possibly the most important one to keep around, as sometimes you run into a big 4K+ monster you can't beat over otherwise, but all of them are replacable if you don't want to use Super Poly.</li><li>Granguinol to summon off Cartesia and dump a Level 6+ LIGHT/DARK. Garura can be dumped for a draw, if we had Chamber's dragon form we'd probably dump that, and Saronir can be used to dump a Branded Spell/Trap. Quaeritis is there as our Despia ED target, I'm replacing it with Luluwalilith once she comes out.</li><li>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres to give us a thing to end on if we have spare bodies, and Underworld Goddess to out Towers and the like. Spheres can be probably be replaced, Verte Anaconda would be a good immediate option if you're not sure.</li></ul><p>And that's the deck as I have it built! Feel free to ask any questions, I'm going to get back to bricking with this stupid thing.</p>"

So in addition to heavenly dragon circle i can play with litte fear of interruption. Gold sarcophagus, is a turn starter and extender, you could banish blackout to get a free lv 4 just in case they pop your token, or negate your swordsoul monsters, or your could banish a target for a graveyard adhara to return to your hand , another option is just making a token so tenyi monsters are live. The extra and side are flexable, id like to add that gravity collapse &amp; Crimson Blader and potentional game enders. Hope you guys enjoy the deck!i would love some feedback or tips</p>"
