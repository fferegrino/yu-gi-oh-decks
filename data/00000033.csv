Five months ago Deer Note wasn't even in Master Duel and Dante was in everyones ED to unbrick bad hands with Uni and E-Tele. Now? Zombies can mill a sixty card deck without grass, spam every lvl 8 and 10 synchro possible, they can scythe lock, have a floodgate field spell that can burden the best deck in the meta, and stops the second best deck, Floowandereeze, altogether. All this while no longer getting locked into zombies. Honestly this deck has become comparable to Adamancipators. Where Adamancipators still has less potential to brick an opening, the end board zombies can make deprecates on Adamacipators as a deck that utilizes a monster type rather than an archetype. You can do anything. Rarely have I not had all three mezuki in grave along with changshi, Chaos Ruler and Doomking. Put whatever you want in the Extra Deck, it doesn't matter, if it is generic and good (or not), zombies will make it. Accesscode, Apollousa, Underworld Goddess, Dweller, Bagooska, Baronne, Chengying, Elf; people are doing Stardust Dragon lines because they can. I know Tearlaments ARE the format, but I would still give zombies a try because they have never been so powerful.</p><p>With all that said, this is my deck! It could be 60 cards, and it could play more handtraps and it could even play branded. That is the point of zombies: pure creative liberty. My deck is built to mill; I can get through a turn and end with 6 cards in main and 4 in Extra. I don't play handtraps because I like to see how far I can take a deck with it's own power, and that means going first and praying they don't have hand traps, which in tear format means I have to watch out for an Imperm and a DD Crow which is more than doable.</p><p>I do not have enough monster zones, I often have to decide what would be the best end board I can make with only six monsters on it. Thanks to Elf, mezuki, and this decks amazing ability to spam lvl 8 monsters, Mad Mauler is the MVP. Make a lvl 10 synchro, bring back Chaos Ruler from the graveyard, bring back Mauler using elf, make another lvl 10 synchro, target one of those synchros with Mauler and summon Red-Eyes, to resummon that lvl 10 in the GY on your opponents turn. End Boards look like, Elf, Red-Eyes, Baronne, Chengying, Doomking, and Rulkallos. Sometimes I will hold off on the Red-Eyes effect to see what would be better, a Chengying, a Sycthe lock, or a second Doomking depending on how they respond to the first one. Sometimes you even have Superpoly or can send your Tears back with a shuffler only to mill again with Merrli and summon Dragostepelia. Anything, anything, anything you want do you can do with this deck, so start labbing because it has never been a better time to mill with zombies!</p>"

The list has kinda changed since last time I posted the first draft but with some changes in the extra deck and and some changes to non-engine cards as well as the side deck. I took out droll and gamma for ash and bystials as well as I put D barrier in the side because they limited gamma, banned super heavy scarecrow, limited purely delicous. You can play droll if you want still if you feel you need it but I believe thats up to you for decide. I chose ash, bystials and D barrier because I am asumming more people will play Branded and Striker since Engane got semi limited and Multi role became unlimited. Ash hits Branded fusion of course and bystials hit the archetype in general which is why I added them in as well as Labrynth. Dimensional barrier is reall good agaisnt Branded and even Kash shutting them off of XYZ, though Kashtira will probably still be the best deck. However I have thought about playing Belle in either the main or side because in testing I rn into alot of bytsials that would banish Visas in GY which hurts alot sincehe is the heart and soul of the deck. I believe we are in a bystial format so be aware of that going forward so be prepared. Another card I thought about playing was destrudo which is another card to add off of Magnamut but I will test more with it and come back with an updated deck if it works. In the extra deck I added IP Masquerena and Underworld goddess. I found myslef having a hard time outing chaos angel going first so that is why I put Underworld goddess and IP was added as just a more easy way to make unicorn if needed. You can play Accesscode if you want which isnt a bad idea but I would need to test more with it and see if it works well.</p>"

I tried to put in sakitama because its easy to summon and easy to get into alembertian or other link cyberse monsters to extend or start your plays. I added the micro coder package to add an extra form of distruption if you end up going into heatsoul. In the extra deck Im using Dark Fluid becuase of how versatile it is with I:P after you go first, and you can also use Dark Fluid plus Nabla if yuo start to go into time (I got this idea from ""The Duelist Cypher"" on youtube, I encourage you to watch his videos because of how entertaining they are). Side deck s pretty simple, Anti-Spell/Sekka for labrynth, DRNM for combo decks, belle for albaz if they try to lock you out, honestly you can switch the evenly matched for anything you like.&nbsp;</p>"

Using no meta cards, this deck relies entirely on the luck of a coin flip! If you call right, pop a card! If you call wrong, well, lets talk about that later!</p><p>Use the monstrous, mechanical dragons known as Desperado Barrel Dragon, Barrel Dragon and Blowback Dragon to blast your opponents cards off the board, but remember, you must believe in your coin to get you the best hits! Even if you do get a tripe Tails, you can use Proton Blast in the GY to make all your results Heads. It's not cheating if it's written on the card!</p><p>Other than the Barrel Dragons, you also have Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler, who will be a 4000 ATK beatstick once you get three monsters on the field, flip a coin and see what upgrade you can get on him! Alongside Arcana, you also have JINZO The Machine Menace, alongside his trusty sidekick Returner. Jinzo The Machine Menance will special summon himself as a 2400 ATK monster while a trap is in the GY or face up on the field (not a Quick Effect). He can whenever tribute himself to rid all traps on the field and summon Returner, who when destroyed will summon Machine Menace again from the GY, but only for a turn, so use him wisely!</p><p>You also have cards like BM-4 Spider who can destroy an opponents monster and inflict burn damage, along with the old Blast Sphere that can do similar work. The mini Twin-Barrel Dragon can pop a card if it tosses two Heads. Keeper and Prisma help to get your Gatling Dragon on the field, Keeper can also summon a Barrel Dragon or Blowback from the Deck, but only in facedown defence position, flip him back up the next turn to activate his effect! Fusion Deployment is a free Barrel or Blowback Dragon from the Deck. Heavy Metal Raiders will upgrade your Barrel Dragons considerably, protecting them and boosting their ATK, while also summoning more Dark Machines! Limiter Removal will double your Barrel Dragons up to 5600 ATK (not permanent).&nbsp;</p><p>Mirror Force is a classic way of protecting your board, and Call of The Haunted is yet another classic that brings back anything from the GY!</p><p>This isn't a great deck, but it is fun and nostalgic. Good luck!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

(That's the reason you run 1 veiler, 1 ogre, and 1 evenly matched)</p><p>Q: No Iblee in main deck?</p><p>A: iblee is a very easy card to out, even if your oppenent doesn't have a link 1 they'll just normal summon a monster then go into phoneix (because everyone and there grandmas running it). But, I do believe it is worthy to side if your going up against lots of decks that don't want to give up there normal summon (purrely sometimes), can't normal summon (kashtira most of the time atleast), or decks that just don't want to special summon (floowandereeze). I would compare this card to ra's disciple in branded (which nobody runs emphasizing my point)</p>"
