As the only 'Dogmatika' spell we play the Nadir Servant which is the E-Emergency call or the Reinforcement of the Army of the deck, the only downside to it is it doesn't have  Dogmatika in the name so it's not searchable by Ecclesia. As only Trap of the deck we play Dogmatika Punishment it's just an additional target for Ecclesia and can help you out problem monsters. In the Extra Deck we only play Titaniklad as a 'real' dogmatika card.</li>  	<li><b>The Shaddoll package</b> has only 3 spots in the main and extra they can be searched by dumping Apkalone with your dogmatika cards. We play 1 Beast and 1 Dragon in addition to the Schism in case we already drew it. Beast helps us dig deeper into the deck and to see more handtraps, Dragon helps us against problem spells/traps like Rivalry of Warlords or Gozen Match.</li>  	<li><b>The Hand Traps/other cards</b> we play about 15 Hantraps in the Main Deck and 3 Forbidden Droplet. For Hand Traps we play 3x Gamma + 1x Driver because it is actually the best Hand Trap this format, it can stop a variety of monster effects with the cost of running one brick in your deck. We also play 3 Nibiru so we can have a better chance against all the Combo Decks in the meta. 3 Ash Blossom are in here just because it is the best against every matchup. Ghost ogre is the only Handtrap we are running at 2 just because it has a limited usage in most matchups and in the matchups it's good against it can limit your opponent in his/her plays. 3 Infinite Impermanence is just the best hand trap you can have going second, in a format full of decks that turbo out true king of all calamities or utopic zexal it and gamma can help you beat those decks. 3 Droplets are essentially the same as impermanence but also can be used if you control another card on the field but only on your first turn.</li>  	<li>The Extra Deck: We play 2 Mechaba with the reasoning you only need 1 but in the mirror you can send cyber dragon nova off the opponents maximus effect to summon the 2nd, the 1 Augoeides comes up in the grind game when you have to remove monsters  from the field. Purgatrio is only in there to OTK your opponent. We play 1 of each Construct, Winda and Apkalone reasoning being you only need 1 of each for your 1 combo going first. As targets for Nadir/Maximus/Punishment we play 1 Fossil Warrior Skull Knight, 1 N'tss 1 Omega 1 Cyber Dragon Nova and 1 Titaniklad. Skull Knight and N'tss do similar where they both destroy cards on the field, the difference being that skull knight is an ignition effect that only can destroy monsters by banishing itself from the gy, but N'tss being a trigger effect that immediately after resolution is applied. I play 1 Anaconda Verte for the side decked super polymerization 2 Semi Invoked cards are Salamangreat Almiraj and Secure Gardna which turn 1 Aleister into a mechaba.</li> </ul> </li>  	<li>The Side Deck is built with side pattern:</li> </ul> <table>  <tr> <td>Side Deck</td> <td>Main Deck</td> <td>Matchups/Reasoning</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1x Pankratops + 3x Cosmic Cyclone + 3x Twin Twisters</td> <td>1x Driver + 3 Gamma +3 Nibiru</td> <td>You side these in a control  matchup going 1st &amp; 2nd like subterror or altergeist just because gamma and Nibiru don't do anything in those Matchups</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1x Artifact Scythe + 2x Sanctum + 1x Trap Trick</td> <td>1x Driver + 3x Gamma</td> <td>This is your side plan for going first against a Combo/ Extra Deck-heavy Deck</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1x Starving venom/Dragon knight draco equiste + 2x Super Poly +1x Pankratops</td> <td>1x Nova +1x Shaddoll Beast 1x Shaddoll Dragon+1x Schism</td> <td>You side these in a relevant matchup going second.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>  </table> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li> Combos: So the most simple 2 card combo is a way to aleister the invoker and nadirs servant. So you start off by doing the standard Invoked stuff with normal summoning aleister adding invocation linking aleister away for almiraj linking almiraj away into secure gardna and activating invocation banishing secure gardna on field and aleister in gy to summon invoked mechaba from the extra deck then you use invocation effect to shuffle it back and adding aleister from the banish pile to the hand. After that you activate nadirs servant to send apkalone and adding maximus. apkalone triggers adding schism and discarding it again. you summon maximus by banishing apkalone from the gy. then you use the effect of maximus sending titaniklad and el shaddoll construct el shaddoll construct triggers adding back the schism and then you set the schism go into end phase activating tianiklad summoning ecclesia and ecclesia adds fleur de lis.on your opponents turn you have 1 Mechaba negate, 1 Winda and 1 Fleur delis negate.</li> </ul>"

Neos Fusion summons Brave Neos by sending Weathering Soldier and the Neos in GY is a perfect fodder for Skull King cus it's lv7, we're playing 2 Neos as follow-up with Rainbow Neos cus it's so powerful. Mathematician and Foolish Burial can either send Jet Synchron or Weathering for Fossil Fusion (if sending Weathering, make sure we have access to Halq by having Tuning/Quickdraw Synchron).  The fossil lineup: 2 Weathering (just in case it's drawn, cus it cant activate from cost, ex. Jet Synchron), 3 Miracle Rupture (searcher and plus if have Fossil Fusion already), 2 Fossil Fusion (2 cus it's dead if drawn, no rock in GY, playing 2 as followup too), 1 Time Stream (searchable, ss Fossil monster from GY).  Tuning/Synchron package is perfect for this deck as Tuning can send Weathering/Fossil card if lucky, Jet is so powerful, and Quickdraw helps Mathematician for Fossil play. The rest is just combo pieces and staple (Nibiru helps alot too, either as Crossout target or Fossil Fusion material).  Pros: Super consistent combo, Fossil followup is self-recurring, can OTK going second.  Cons: Boring Halq deck.

Decatron + Rekindling = 8100.","This deck is 60 cards deep because drawing infernoids in your infernoid deck is a bad thing regardless of the build  The deck plays 30+ going second cards, 19 of which are hand traps you can use on your opponents turn like <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, and some of which can also be used on our own turn like <a data-name=""Psy-Framegear Gamma"">Psy-Framegear Gamma</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, and we add another 15 going second cards that can be used to force out negates like <a data-name=""Mystic Mine"">Mystic Mine</a> and push through an opponents board, several give you access to your bricks... I mean monsters, such as <a data-name=""Void Imagination"">Void Imagination</a>, <a data-name=""Void Vanishment"">Void Vanishment</a> to search Imagination or <a data-name=""Void Feast"">Void Feast</a> should you actually go first, <a data-name=""Void Apocalypse"">Void Apocalypse</a>, while a mediocre card it can bait an <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>, or set up <a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a> as well being a Void card to be used with Feast, although it will never be searched off of V<a data-name=""oid Vanishment"">oid Vanishment</a>, although it often is a wonderful top deck milling 1 or more infernoids with its second effect.  Because drawing infernoid monsters is so bad I filled the rest of the deck with extenders that go well with <a data-name=""Infernoid Decatron"">Infernoid Decatron</a> like, <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, <a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a> and <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>. One normal summoned Decatron plus a reborn card is <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> into a 5300 atk <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>  plus a summonable <a data-name=""Infernoid Attondel"">Infernoid Attondel</a> for 8100 damage.  The play is normal decatron and send whatever (pop a card depending on what was sent), link into <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a>, reborn decatron and send attondel, link into halqifibrax which summons veiler, then link into <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</a> link into Accesscode targeting Selene for 5300 atk, then summon Attondel by banishing whatever the first noid sent was and decatron for an additional 2800 atk. This combo is reliant on both players having 3 spells on the field or in the grave but you can always just place Apocalypse, Vanishment, or <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> of the field to add additional spells to the count.  Another nice play comes off of resolving Feast, you just summon a decatron to zone 2 and 4, and <a data-name=""Infernoid Sjette"">Infernoid Sjette</a> to any other zone. Next you can make 1 decatron and sjette into an <a data-name=""Akashic Magician"">Akashic Magician</a> to return the other decatron to hand to be normal summoned regardless of which extra monster zone your opponent may occupy. Then you can potentially co-link Akashic with a <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>, or a <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, Accesscode, or <a data-name=""Crusadia Equimax"">Crusadia Equimax and use her second effect to call whatever card you want in your deck, I usually call Rekindling as its a 3 of and there is a possible benefit of milling </a><a data-name=""Galaxy Cyclone"">Galaxy Cyclone</a><a data-name=""Crusadia Equimax""> to use on a future turn.  The galaxy cyclone also combos with mine and feast, you can activate cyclone in grave to turn off your own mine then chain feast while your opponent cannot respond with monster effects. You can also play around mine with feast and imagiantion if your opponent has two or more monster and one was from the extra deck. You can summon </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Tierra"">Infernoid Tierra, and use it to mill 2 </a><a data-name=""Elder Entity N'tss"">Elder Entity N'tss </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Tierra"">and something else. You can then use N'tss to pop mine and chain feast to dodge Ash.</a>  &nbsp;"

Draw 2+ per turn with the Dark Magician engine combined with the Dogmatika engine, while hati","The Dark Magician engine is really really good at doing exactly 1 thing, and that's drawing cards turn after turn. The Dogmatika engine makes Winda, and hates extra decks, and even assists with the Dark Magician thing by throwing Dragon Knight into the bin. You can also make Dragoon or The Dragon Knight, or even The Dark Magicians with Eye of Timaeus, out here rocking Yugi's playbook. Restage with Souls helps gain advantage while searching Right Hand, a Spell Negate that can even get around single copies of Spell Speed 4 spells, gives the deck a little easy negation on an extender, because being real, if you somehow didn't see Souls, you're not doing a lot.  Trying Wonder Wand and Upstart Goblin in the last couple of slots. I really like how Restage feels in combination with, but any card draw helps find souls, which is basically the deck's whole game plan, and I feel light on it. On the other hand, I don't want to run Allure, because the idea is not to banish the Souls.  Cut Eye of Timaeus. The card is great, but the deck was needing more card draw. I'm up to 2 Wonder Wand. This is not the first time I've tried the card, but I was liking it at 1 copy, and I want to see if a second copy helps increase consistency by drawing me Souls after Soul Servant. That also frees up room for Accesscode and the third Winda.  I think the Foolish Burial Goods engine is really good in DM, especially since you can search Right Hand by sending Restage in addition to the Soul Servant and Metalfoes fusion.  I'm down to one Restage. I think I can improve consistency by upping the card draw, and every copy of Foolish Burial Goods can draw me Right Hand if I run 1. I'm also back on 1 Wonder Wand. At 1 in this deck it does help improve consistency a fair bit.  Clara and Rushka should be good enough for a Spellcaster Link 1 until Magistus comes to TCG. I'd probably run Magistus link 1 over Relinquished Anima, and cut Clara and Rushka for something else, maybe another Link 4 or Big Eye.  Magician Girl was just here for the Soul Servant, so I've replaced her with Palladium Oracle Mahad. This might occasionally be another extender with a relevant floating effect, but really, all it has to do to make the slot if be occasionally slightly more useful than DMG.  Turns out DMG being a 1 Tribute monster with 2300-2600 ATK points is more relevant than occasionally special summoning a level 7. Or at the very least it started coming up pretty quickly.

With the release of meow meow, the deck has gotten infinitely more consistant, with a 1 card generic combo, a plethora of 2 card combos that either end on toad and butler or set up butler with only 4 summons, or a 3 card combo that can make toad as summon number 4, effectively playing through any handtrap. This build tries to capitalize on these combos, making decent first turn boards that interrupt your opponent. That is not to dissuade anyone from trying a build with more hand traps over the spells that extend your combos, as those builds are superior in some instances.  &nbsp;  In the future, I would like to add in crossout designator, but as of the posting of this, there are no announcements on its arrival to the TCG."

Your ideal hand is ""Nadir Servant"" &amp; ""Aleister the Invoker."" ""Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon"" adds a bit of utility in bringing back your ""Titaniklad, the Ashen Dragon"" and provides another form of non-targeting, non-destruction removal. Always utilize the invoked plays before the dogmatika plays. Additionally, ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"" typically summons better on your second turn, by linking ""El Shaddoll Winda"" with another monster to bring out ""Predaplant Verte Anaconda.""  THEME:  What we find is a chaos Spellcaster deck, wherein the church of Dogmatika fights against the heretical Aleister and the Shaddolls, whose fusion summoning has distorted and incited the power of the void in the Abyss. Empowered beyond comprehension by this chaos, the ""Fallen of Albaz,"" an entity of the void, has transformed beyond ""Titaniklad"" into his final form, ""Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon!"" The end of the world is nigh: will each side come together to summon the ultimate Spellcaster, ""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon,"" or will the world cease to exist?

However, since this deck can make multiple, somewhat lack luster negations and can be used as material for <strong>Mechaba</strong> blinding first seems viable.  A good starting hand for this deck would be a <strong>Souten</strong> monster (any is fine, but <strong>Koukoku of the Souten Kicks</strong> is best for the search for the trap and <strong>Yuuhi of the Souten Fists</strong> is best for fusion plays) and <strong>Souten Calling</strong>. <strong>Calling</strong> can summon up to 5 Tokens which is broken, but you can only fusion summon from the extra deck for the rest of the turn. If you have <strong>Koukoku</strong> on the field when <strong>Calling</strong> is activated you can summon 2 <strong>Gaiun of the Souten Kicks</strong> and have 1 live negate for your opponent's turn. If you have <strong>Yuuhi of the Souten Fists</strong>, you can make the <strong>Armades</strong> (<strong>Kongou</strong>) and a <strong>Gaiun</strong> with a live negate. If you have <strong>Invocation</strong> and<strong> Aleister</strong>, you can then banish an extra token on the field (yes this is legal) or a <strong>Souten</strong> in the grave to make<strong> Mechaba</strong>.  <strong>Koukoku</strong> searches your <strong>Souten</strong> Traps. <strong>Two as One</strong> is garbage but it searches <strong>Souten</strong> monsters and it is a <strong>Set Rotation</strong> target. <strong>Meltdown</strong> is your other field spell and it searches <strong>Aleister</strong>. <strong>ROTA</strong> is actually needed in this deck since there are only 2 unique maindeck <strong>Souten</strong> monsters and you kind of have to see them in order to get negates.  Your interruptions are <strong>Ash Blossom</strong>, <strong>PSY-Framegear Gamma</strong>, <strong>Souten Exorcism</strong>, <strong>Souten's Duty</strong> (it can copy <strong>Exorcism</strong>), <strong>Gaiun of the Souten Kicks</strong>, <strong>Invoked Mechaba</strong>, and <strong>Invoked Augoeides</strong>.  Going second, <strong>Phantazmay</strong> and <strong>Nibiru</strong> are the better hand traps. <strong>Impermanence</strong> can be sided in for <strong>Souten's Duty.</strong> <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> since this deck does not break boards.<strong> Kongou</strong> and <strong>Purgatrio</strong> are your damage dealers.  Since there are tokens in this deck, which are normal monsters, you could play things like <strong>First of the Dragons</strong> which is a <strong>Towers</strong>, but then you would have to play <strong>Polymerization</strong> since <strong>Invocation</strong> doesn't banish for the summon unless it's for an <strong>Invoked</strong> monster.

Kaijus clear bosses and set for the mekk-knights, Invoked for more negates power and flexibility. Mekks for overwhelming OTKs if all else fails This deck is about being smart with your plays. use your opponents cards for more summons (invoked or link) {Brain control / mind control}  Also do know i will educate you like you´ve never played invoked, or mekk-knight decks before so i will state the obvious.  <span><strong>Run down </strong></span>  i suppose there is never a specific play but its a very flexibly deck. 8 handtrap negates / 3 traps (negate´s) ,  1 handtrap, 1 monster, 4 kaiju, 2 spells (monster removal) , 1 handtrap, 1 monster, 1 spell (spell/trap removal).  and that isn´t including siding or Extra Deck both of which have more. invoked elysium is a monster wipe, Rainbow is monster spell or grave wipe, Augoedes BLS and unicorn are all 1 monster/card pop/removals.  i have the deck sided very specifically the only card id consider removing is the Nibirus for 1 mystic mine &amp; any 1 other tech card  Mystic Mine is for HEROs specifically shuts them down the best of all cards i´ve seen at worst force them to deck out. at best collect your resources lay a different feild spell and OTK  Artifact because most decks that specifically banish die to it IE: dino´s, Golden castle  Invocation, blue sky, neos fusion &amp; brain control are extras i interchange depending on opponents deck. if they use mostly Extra deck monsters or only end on Extra deck monsters take out brain control and add something else  Ghost bell &amp; ghost ogre  these cards i use less than the main deck handtraps but i still use semi often, you could change them for favored techs  nibiru i´ve recently been playing around with but the fact it nukes your feild as well doesn´t go well with this deck. its a first turn card that doesnt have much use after that lightning storm could atleast help a mekk-knights summon nibiru cant even do that  <span><strong>First turn plays</strong>   (* indicates a new thread of cards) <span>*Aleister -&gt; Almiraj -&gt; secure gardna -&gt; Mechaba (needs aleister in hand)  is the most obvious and one of the few first turn plays  *Aleister -&gt; almiraj -&gt; secure gardna.  *Mystic mine (needs aleister &amp; mystic mine in hand)  is a play against many spamming decks but doesn´t always work summoning mechaba and then mystic mining is an alternative as well but Secure gardna makes it if they attack your fine and then they have no monster effects  *Aleister -&gt; Almiraj *s/t *Mekk-knights (needs aleister &amp; any mekk-knight)  This is okay if your only trying to get bodies on the feild but not good for much else, you     can´t even use blue skys effect i only use it if i happen to have infinite impertinence in hand  *aleister-&gt; almiraj -&gt; secure gardna -&gt; mechaba -&gt;Elysium (need aleister &amp; invocation in hand) this is one of the better plays but still a very weak one  this deck sucks going 1st but as long as you survive a round without being OTKed you should have a chance to win  <strong><span>Going 2nd plays</span></strong><span>  </span>This is really were the deck shines, theres too many plays to list Especially since it doesn´t take into account your opponet´s cards but i´ll list some very basic plays  *purple nightfall -&gt; Blue sky -&gt; 1 / 2 mekk knights (need purple nightfall)      this will put bodies on the field for BLS or predaplant  verte  *aleister -&gt; Almiraj *set spell *mekk knight * Almiraj / mekk knight -&gt; predaplant (need Aleister &amp; a mekk knight)  this will get you rainbow assuming predaplant isnt negated ALWAYS SUMMON RAINBOW LAST to those of you who don´t know.     this also links up with the last play as you can summon purple for blue sky then use blue skys effect and later us blue sky to summon predaplant  Magic meltdown -&gt; aleister *Aleister -&gt; any invoked (need alister or magic meltdown) this is obvious but to those who can´t read what meltdown does is put aleister in hand  *Dinowrestler -&gt; pop *Kaiju slumber/ line up their cards *mekk-knights (Dinowrestler &lt;- optional , Need kaiju slumber &amp; mekk knight blue sky or purple knightfall) another semi obvious play but a useful one <strong><span>NOTES </span></strong> brain control / Monster reborn   ///   neither of these say you cannot use the monsters effect, go ahead and use your opponents monsters effects to aid you just make sure you dispose of the monster before the end of the turn or win if your using brain control     </span></span>"

Hand traps can be combo pieces too!,"Dogmatika and Nekroz actually have some interesting synergies. Notable, the Nekroz monsters are summoned from the hand, not the extra deck, and the deck likes searching by sending Herald of the Arc Light. Rather than try and fit a third engine into the deck, I decided to normal summon hand traps that can go into Almiraj then Secure Gardna, to get a monster from my extra deck onto the field and in the bin. In this sense, the 12 hand traps double as our normal summon. The usual board state you end on is some Dogmatika cards, Nekroz of Unicore, and El Shaddoll Winda on your opponent's turn. Basically you lock them out of the extra deck, and then if they break that you lock them out of summoning. You also have a slew of negation options, with Fleurdelis, Clausolas, and Apkallone (in addition to hand traps and Nekroz cards which are situational hand traps).  The whole plan is normal summon a hand trap, link it into Almiraj, into Secure Gardna, summon Ecclesia, add Maximus, Summon Maximus, send Herald + Apkallone, add a ritual spell/monster, add Shaddoll Schism, discard 1. After that all you need is one Unicore/Clausolas/Brionac/Kaleidoscope and you're making Unicore and Winda.  I have no suggestions for the side deck. Since you need to run hand traps with less than 1000 ATK you can normal summon for the combo, choices for interaction are limited. I put some cards there, but probably the best call is not to side."

Come here if you want to beat Eldlich and Rocks &#x1f440;,"With the newly added Archetype Dogmatika from the Rise of the Duelist Expansion also comes the new strategy ""Dogmatika Invoked"". Already being a top tier deck in the OCG it may be worth a try to also try it in the TCG.  The Invoked part of the Deck focusses highly around getting out Aleister. You can search him by Magical Meltdown, which also prevents the negation or interruption of your fusion summons. By normal summoning Aleister you can add the Spell Card Invocation. This can be used to fusion summon the Fusion Monsters. First of all, after normal summoning Aleister, the first thing you always do, is to Link summon Almiraj and then Link summon Secure Gardna. Like that you have the needed requirements for Invoked Mechaba, which should be your priority when going first.  The Dogmatika part of the Deck focusses more on putting Monsters from your Extra Deck on to the Graveyard to get out your Main Deck Monsters. Ecclesia is the card that can search you any other Dogmatika Card by normal summoning her or by special summoning her when a Monster special summoned from the Extra Deck is on the field. Maximus can be a great card to get 2 monsters from the Extra Deck into your Graveyard, while also forcing your opponent to put 2 in their graveyard. Fleur de Lis is best searched by Ash Dragon in the End Phase, because if you special summon her, she can negate the effects of one of your Opponents Monsters. Punishment can be good for clearing two monsters at once by first of all dumping N'Tss into the graveyard and afterwards with the effect of N'Tss also destroying one of the Opponents Monsters. With Nadir you should always add whatever the situation needs. If you have no Ecclesia I would suggest always getting her, in order for you to search another Dogmatika Card after searching her and therefore getting even more cards into the graveyard.  The Last Part of the Deck is the Shaddoll part. It is small but still very important! With any of your Dogmatika cards you can dump Apkallone into your Graveyard activating her effect to search you a Shadoll Schism. If you have then another Dark Monster on your field or your graveyard and the Apkallone still in the Graveyard you can proceed to special summon Winda in your oppponents turn, which prevents him from special summoning more than once.  Next up, I will explain why I put the Extra Deck monsters into the Deck like I did: <table>  <tr> <td>El Shaddoll Apkallone</td> <td>Like I already said, she is the searcher for Shadoll Schism so you can Summon out Winda</td> </tr> <tr> <td>El Shaddoll Winda</td> <td>Winda is very easy to get out in this Deck. You just need a Dogmatika card and one other Dark Monster (what Aleister coincidentally is). Apkallone also forces you to discard a card after activating her effect, so if you draw the Shaddoll Beast you can pitch it, draw a card and also get Winda. So much with only one card!</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Elder Entity N'Tss</td> <td>It is just a great card to pitch in your opponents turn with Punishment. Its 2500 ATK gives it a great variety of cards to destroy with Punishment and after that lets you destroy even another card!</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Invoked Augoeides</td> <td>Some play this card at 2, but I really do not like that. If necessary you can cycle it with Omega but in my opinion it does not see enough play to be worth the 2 slots. At one it is really good if you want to clear one card of your Opponents field easily and against some decks, they can not comprehend having to destroy the first special summoned card of theirs and cannot play around it. Great floodgate if you play against the right decks. Also really easy to get out later in the game if you have many Fusion Monsters in your Graveyard.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Invoked Mechaba</td> <td>Mechaba is the best Invoked card out their! You have a theoretical omni negate with only 1 card! Aleister into Almiraj into Secure Gardna gives you the needed materials and Aleister even searches you the Invocation. Because often your Mechaba gets Called or you have at the moment no easy way of recycling it, you really want to play 2 of them. Also you can get out 2 of them sometimes and they are only once per copy so you have 2 omni negates at once.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Invoked Purgatrio</td> <td>This is just the card for you to easy board wipe your Opponents monsters and often to OTK him. It is also very easy to get out with just Aleister and Almiraj. Nothing special, just a good card.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Titaniklad the Ash Dragon</td> <td>This card is just there for you to add in your End Phase after pitching him with Nadir, Punishment or Maximus a copy of Fleur de Lis for the great interruption in your Opponents turn.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PSY-Framelord Omega</td> <td>This card is a great way of recycling your already pitched cards. Also you can side in Gamma and Driver so you can sometimes even bring him out.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Wind Pegasus @Ignister</td> <td>Good for interruption, if your Opponent somehow destroys one of your cards but even better in stopping OTK's. When your Opponents tries to, for example, kill you with Borrelsword, he has to first of all kill one of your monsters, which gives you the window to bounce him back to the Extra Deck to live one more turn.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aleister the Invoker of Madness</td> <td>You do not know how many times I have the situation of being able to summon something with my  Invocation but I have no Aleister. Well that is why I put this card in. Of course you cannot just pitch him with Dogmatika cards and proceed to summon your Invoked cards, but still, I really often had the situation where this guy gave me the Aleister I needed. Also he is a backup when I banished again all of my Aleisters with Pot of Desires lol.</td> </tr>  </table> For Handtraps I chose Ash Blossom (3x), Ghost Ogre (2x) and Impermanence (3x) because I think they are the best working in this Deck but also in this format. You can easily swap them out like you want. The same goes for the Side Deck, only Gamma and Driver I would really keep if you want to play Omega, it gives you so much more value. If you want to, you can drop the Omega, Gamma and Driver and instead put Construct into the Main Extra Deck to have another target for Schism. I chose to put her into the Side Deck because in some Match ups she can be really really useless. Dark Ruler can also be swapped for Droplet and Evenly Matched can be swapped for Lightning Storm. The Kaiju comes sometimes really in handy when you want to get rid of negates like Borreload or co. With Nibiru I am thinking of putting in third one, same goes for Called. The Side can easily change depending on the format, but this one really works out for me in this particular format.  Last but not least a few warnings and tips when playing with this Deck. <ul>  	<li>Always start with your Invoked cards before using the Dogmatika Cards, they lock you out of the Extra Deck!</li>  	<li>Do not give up to easily when seeing a big enemy board, the Deck can play through these boards really good!</li>  	<li>Beware that Punishment locks you out of your Extra Deck the next turn if you activate it in your opponents turn, so you will have to wait with summoning things like Invoked Monsters.</li>  	<li>The deck is at first glance really easy to play due to the linear combos and easy to understand cards, but it is not as easy as it seems. It is a Deck where you really have to know the format and the other Decks that await you in order to win. Because of the simple and linear cards you have, you really have to be good in every situation. The Deck is not forgiving when it comes to mistakes, every game looks different when playing this Deck. Also their are very cool interactions and cheesy plays possible with the Deck you either have to learn or have to come up with them while playing.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  If you master this Deck I guarantee you a really fun time, due to the different situations every time playing. Right now it is a really strong deck and probably Tier 1 or Tier 2. If you seek for a variation of Dogmatika without the Invoked part I recommend checking out the Dogmatika Eldlich Deck, which I also like playing and which is even stronger than the Dogmatika Invoked variation. If you want to play an Invoked Deck without Dogmatika I would recommend playing Invoked Shaddoll, which is really bad in the current format, but still really fun and capable of winning Locals or even Regionals. Another variation could be Invoked Eldlich which is really good right now, but I would say worse than this Deck and also not fun to play in my opinion or you can play Invoked Mekk-Knight, the oldest meta variation of Invoked, which is pretty okay.  When further questions occur or some more tips are needed you can ask in the comment section and I will try my best to help.  I wish you a lovely day and take care!  &nbsp;"

Do your best everyone!","The core of the Rock deck has remained the same, but there are some new cards to add to the pool, such as Miracle Rupture and Koa'ki Meiru Supplier. Supplier is a clear upgrade over the other janky generic Earth Rock monsters, but Rupture to send Revival Golem might actually be worse than just running Unexpected Dai, since the Golem isn't a tuna. On the other hand, you can use it as an extender mid-combo, which isn't an option with Unexpected Dai, and you can still build ridiculous boards off of just Gallant Granite.  The other new option is Forbidden Droplet, which gives a spell speed 4 way to get through multiple monster effects at the cost of cards from the hand. Seems like an immediate going second staple in the side deck, and looks main deckable in a lot of circumstances.  The deck still ends on the same(ish) boards, a bunch of lines of interaction plus maybe Abyss Dweller, hopefully I:P with Block Dragon for fun and profit. With Droplet in the Meta I couldn't see Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos as quite as good an option anymore, but maybe I'm overthinking things, since I'm not sure Dweller fares better against the card."

There's still a lot of room for improvement to the deck, even with just the current card pool, and I was excited to see Dogmat","Eldlich deck running the Dogmatika engine to hate on the extra deck. A bunch of Rotas let you put El Shaddoll Apkallone into the GY to find the new trap, thus setting up Winda and maybe an extra negate. Forbidden Droplet gives us a spell speed 4 way to help shut down a board full of negates in the high end, and also the benefit of pitching Eldlich cards is pretty high. Eldlich numbers are pretty standard, Extravagance and Magicians' Souls work together to gather card advantage, and no longer requires bricks since Dogmatika monsters are spellcasters.  The extra deck includes a few different packages. There isn't a lot of room for hand traps in the deck, so I'm running packages of 6. Nibiru and Dark Ruler are for combo matchups, though you can also run a combo of Dark Ruler and Forbidden Droplet for Spell Speed 4 negation. Effect Veiler can come in as a generic hand trap, which is generally useful in stopping the opponent's turn, usually alongside Imperm. Lightning Storm, Red Reboot, and Anti-Magic Arrows are for backrow matchups, Eldlich, Altergeist, Guru, to stop their traps, though some Eldlich decks must be treated as combo decks instead. I'd like Cosmic and D.D. Crow for the mirror, but hating on the extra deck and making Winda should help against combo variants, and hopefully the high consistency helps pull ahead against more pure control variants."

Dark World Deck 2020,"The strategy of this deck is simple. Summon a ton of cards while also drawing a ton of cards to dig for your main combo pieces ultimately creating an extremely oppressive board that has only a couple weaknesses. Ideally you want to open a lot of dangers and if you don't your combo can be cut short before you can really get started. That is the inherent weakness of the deck. However, this doesn't happen all that often unless you are having really bad luck with getting your dangers sniped or if your opponent has a lot of hand traps.  The combo pieces you want to dig for are Cyber-stein and plaguespreader. Best case scenerio you get to hold onto your normal summon until you draw cyber-stein but sometimes you will be forced to normal summon something else like armageddon knight or plaguespreader. This is not a big deal because you can summon the cyber-stein off of saryuja's effect. Usually the first monster I summon from the extra deck is Dugares the Timeless. He is easy to summon since there are so many level 4 monsters in the deck. You are almost always going to activate Dugares' first effect, the one that lets you draw 2 and discard for non-cost. This effect is SO good in this deck because the discard will allow you to get a dark world effect if you discard it. If you have a Broww the Hunstman in hand you want to discard that, giving you another draw. After that just summon more dangers until you have 4-5 monsters on field so you can summon Saryuja. If you had 5 monsters on field try to leave a level 4 on field. This will allow you to use saryujas effect to summon plaguespreader from hand (if you drew it or had it already). You can also summon plaguespreader from the GY so don't worry if it ends up there. Once you have Saryuja, a level 4, and Plaguespreader on field, you can go ahead and link Saryuja off for Linkross. You want to summon 3 tokens upon activating linkross effect. This will now allow you to summon Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys and DRAW 4 CARDS off its effect. By now you will probably have at least one beginning of the end or pot of avarice in hand so now it is time to dig for Cyber-Stein. Just keep summoning and drawing cards until you get Cyber-Stein. You can even use Pot of Avarice to put Saryuja back in your extra deck to summon it again to dig for Cyber-Stein thus also granting you a free way to special summon it. Sometimes Cyber-Stein will be towards the bottom of your deck so my rule of thumb is if you have under 10 cards left in your deck it is best to just give up on it and settle for ending on Apollousa Bow of the Goddess, Ravenous Croc, and Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax. If you are able to grab Cyber-Stein, you are going to use its effect to summon Naturia Exterio. This card is very strong as it pretty much lets you negate half the game since it negates both spells and traps and is not once per turn or even once per chain. You just have to make sure that your deck has enough cards to put out enough negates without decking out.  Sorry if this description is confusing but it is kind of hard to make a step by step for this deck since it is all about random drawing and luck. Just test it out and you will eventually understand how to play it efficiently. Also, you can do the draw 4 combo by using Genex Ally Birdman and another monster to summon Crystron Halqifabrax and use its effect to summon Plaguespreader. Now you just need 2 more monsters on board to make Saryuja and then use its effect to summon a level 4.  If you have any questions, please feel free to message me!"

Hyper Librarian and Junk Speeder to draw essentially your whole deck on your first turn.,"I'm not very good at writing out combo guides, especially for decks like this that don't have one big long combo, instead using a bunch of smaller combos that string together, so bear with me.  The combo starts with getting a Junk Synchron in your hand and a non-tuner level 2 in the grave. You can achieve this easiest by using Quickdraw or Junk Converter to send the card, and opening Tuning, Junk Converter, or just Junk Synchron itself. From there, summon a level 2, Synchron Carrier lets you summon Junk Synch, Caligo summons itself when Junk Synch is on the field, and Doppelwarrior summons itself when Junk Synchron revives a monster. Next, go into Junk Speeder,  summoning another Junk Synchron and a Jet Synchron. From there, summon Hyper Librarian, then turn Jet Synchron and Junk Speeder into Stardust Charge Warrior, drawing one from Hyper Librarian and one from Charge Warrior.

Time Thief:  Regulator is your go to card because he can special 2 Time Thief monsters. Depending on your hand you will have to adapt, but most of the times you will be able to get enough monsters on the field to xyz.  Link summon into Bujinki to then special redoer, or go into redoer immediately, again, depending on the situation. Try to use Chronorecorder as material, banish redoer and bring back Chrono on the field. At this point you should still be able to special something (either a dogmatika or a Time thief), use them as material for Perpetua.  Redoer comes back at end phase.  Use Perpetua to give material to Redoer (Time Thief Flyback) and special a time thief from grave (best option is Time Thief Winder because his effect will activate and you can add a Time Thief card to hand.) You can use this oppurtunity to get a Negate/Time Thief Retrogade but this is completely up to you. Use Redoer to interrupt, or get rid of dangerous monsters. Also more draw power.  Dogmatika:  Dogmatika Ecclesia is a really good card that gets you another dogmatika card in hand. She also is a level 4 so she can be used as material. Dogmatika Fleurdelis is a good handtrap to have in hand that can also boost your other Dogmatika Monsters. The goal is to get Maximus on the field to use the grave effects of your extra deck.  You can either use Fossil Warrior Skull Knight or Elder Entity N'tss to destroy cards from the field, or use Titaniclad the Ash Dragon to special or add dogmatika to your hand. (You can special Ecclesia and her effect will activate)  Shaddoll:  The goal here is to block your opponent with Winda. Using Dogmatika Maximus or Dogmatika Punishment you can send Shaddoll Apkalone to grave to get Shaddoll Schism.

Cards such as Liquid Soldier, Solid Soldier, Blazeman, and Summoner Monk give you an extra boost to your speed. The magic and trap cards are designed to summon or recall as many monsters as possible to make even more fusions. EH Ocean is the engine of this deck, because it allows you to return any monster in your hand or in the extra deck (except the 2 XYZ and 2 non-HERO monsters) even if in the GY. The third copy of Ocean is in the side deck because liquid soldier allows you to summon any monster of level 4, or lower, specially. All elemental hero fusions don't have specific monster names to summon them, so all available monster cards can be used."

A pure Blackwing Deck that mixes up just slightly.,"So, this is my take on a pure Blackwing Synchro deck.  Main plays here obviously revolve around the use of Auster the South Wind and Simoon the Poison Wind. <ul>  	<li>Simoon is your main combo starter, if he and any other Blackwing are in your hand, you can banish another Blackwing to grab a Black Whirlwind from your deck, which will allow you to search Auster (or any other Blackwing you want to grab from deck to extend your combo). This not only provides you an easy search, since Simoon's 1600 attack points will allow you to search just about every other Blackwing in the deck besides Bora the Spear and Kris the Crack of Dawn, but you will be able to normal summon whatever you searched because Simoon's effect does not take up your turn's normal summon.</li>  	<li>Auster can not only bring back any one of your level 4 or lower Blackwings, but has a secondary effect that works in tandem with Blackwing Armor Master, Blackwing Full Armor Master, or even Black-Winged Dragon, for the cost of banishing it from the GY. Bear in mind that Auster cannot be special summoned at all (It shares this trait with Blackwing Blizzard the Far North). Auster also works well with the 3 copies of Allure of Darkness since it will summon your Blackwing banished by that effect.</li> </ul> There is no Go-To combo for this deck, as it's meant to be more versatile than a standard combo deck, which is why there's a large variety in the Synchros here.  Small tips and tricks other than the Simoon/Auster plays: <ul>  	<li>Foolish Burial is meant for Vayu the Emblem of Honor or Zephyros the Elite. Vayu is used to Synchro summon from the GY (usually with Bora, Kris, or Zephyros to create Blackwing Gram the Shining Star or Assault Blackwing Sohaya the Rainstorm, which, if you have a lvl 7 such as Chidori the Rain Sprinkling or Raikiri the Rain Shower on the field already, that's an easy setup to Accel Synchro Summon Onimaru the Divine Thunder).</li>  	<li>If you put Zephyros in the GY, it's best to use his effect on a face up Black Whirlwind, or Gale the Whirlwind/Bora the Spear in order to resurrect him, since both Gale and Bora have no limit on their special summons.</li>  	<li>Using any two main deck monsters to summon Raidraptor Wise Strix, use its effect to pull out Zephyros the Elite from your deck for easier combo extension, as opposed to Bora or Kris.</li>  	<li>Blackwing Breeze the Zephyr, upon being searched by Black Whirlwind, can immediately special summon itself.</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave is meant for Ash Blossoms or Ghost Ogres that try to stop your Black Whirlwind.</li>  	<li>Blizzard + Harmattan can create a lvl 6 (Nothung the Starlight) which then extends your combos since he gives you an additional normal summon.</li>  	<li>Twin Twisters/MST is simple and effective Spell/Trap control.
