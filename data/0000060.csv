He brought his new friends to show the world what he can do!,"I found this deck in a status update on Dueling Book. It seemed like a lot of fun to play, so I imported the deck. I've only made very minor changes since.  This deck isn't very strong, nor is it that consistent. However, if some of the cards work together and your opponent doesn't have disruption cards, you can bring out cards like Toadally Awesome and the 'Borrel' Link Monsters. Pretty fancy I'd say, for a Frog that was never allowed to play with the other Frogs.  Since recording the duel video that I used this deck in, I realized that Wetlands could be a very nice card to use in this deck. I will likely include that when I use this deck again. Would that happen in a duel video, then I will edit this list as well. For now, it's in the Side Deck."

Shaddoll engine is usable in a fair amount of decks, here we go with a combination of 4 engines that can lock the opponent or just OTK with Artifacts, Invokeds and Mekk-Knights.  So the strategy is to set a board using the combo with Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star to countain opponent's monster effects and back it up with Invoked monsters like Mechaba and Artifacts like Scythe if having Artifact Sanctum or a way to summon Artifacts from the graveyard. When going second, the idea is to abuse of Mekk-Knight engine and Shaddoll Fusion's full power effect to set a solid OTK board that can bypass most of boards when having sufficient ressources.  &nbsp;  So the monster engines are quite specific due to the presence of 4 archetypes. The shaddoll engine countains Shaddoll Beast, Shaddoll Dragon and Shaddoll Hedgehog to respectively draw, destroy backrow and tuto other shaddoll cards when sent to the graveyard by a card effect, meaning that you can use Shaddoll Fusion at his full potential when going second, and even Invocation if not having the Shaddoll Fusion. It is usefull to create card advantage while setting the basics of your boards, or just contribute to lock the opponent when finishing a going first turn with El Shaddoll Winda and El Shaddoll Grysta.  The artifacts are reduced to 2 Artifact Scythe and Artifact Moralltach to avoid bricks but have fair chances to have one paired with Artifact Ignition. They special summon themselves when destroyed from the spell and trap zones and trigger an effect if it was during the opponent's turn, the first one locking the extra deck and the second destroying a card on the field. They contribute to countain opponent's board when starting first to better OTK and are materials for the summon of El Construct Shaddoll and Invoked Mechaba. Be aware that since they set themselves in the backrow, they can help the summon f the Mekk-Knight monsters so you can spam more easily.  Invoked engine of course is reduced to Aleister The Invoker, and gains power thanks to Salamangreat Almiraj that can use the normal summoned Aleister to directly enable the summon of Mekk-Knight monsters when going first and have an Aleister in the graveyard to fully use Invocation. They also can give a +1000/1000 boost for any fusion monster to survive some battle phases or perform  OTKs with offensive threats like Invoked Purgatrio.  Finally the Mekk-Knight engine goes for 3 Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall, 2 Mekk-knight Blue Sky, 1 Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse and 1 Mekk-Knight Red Moon. Purple can tuto by banishing himself or another Mekk-Knight, meaning that you will be ensured to have an Invoked Mechaba when going first, and a monster that will come back for the next turn to search Blue and spam the board. Blue Sky tuto an equal amount of cards that are in the opponent's side of it's column to search the entire engine and rapidly get access to threats like Borrelsword Dragon. Indigo moves the Mekk-Knight to liberate zones for more summons and is the master piece of the control combo of going first games. Lastly Red can destroy monsters of the same column by banishing a Mekk-Knight of the graveyard and can enable OTKs by cutting annoying monsters in defense position or with some defensive effects.  &nbsp;  The spell and traps packages is designed to soften the statistics and enabling the most spam potential for defensive first turns or offensive second turns. The invoked engine countains 3 Magical Meltdown to protect monster effects and tuto Aleister, and Invocation to summon Invoked fusion monsters using Aleister from the graveyard and some monsters in opponent's graveyard to limitate some decks like Cyber Dragon by striking key monsters. Invocation can come back in the deck from the graveyard to recycle banished Aleisters and generate defensive plays or more spam plays. Lastly The Book Of The Law can fusion simmon an Invoked monster by using another on the field in rapid effect to protect your monsters from destruction or extend battle phases to gain access to easier OTKs.  The Artifact engine countains 2 Artifact Ignition and 3 Artifact Sanctum. Ignition can destroy a spell or trap card in rapid effect to set an artifact in the backrow zones directly from the deck and cycle it, this is usefull to suppress annoying cards of the opponent or just trigger set Artifact monster's effects during the opponent's turn. Artifact Sanctum summons an Artifact monster directly from the deck and can search Scythe to lock the extra deck and punish a lot of meta decks or just summon a Moralltach to destroy a card in specific match ups like Dark Magician and True Draco to catch an Eternal Soul or a Dragonic Diagram  World Legacy Cards allows more consistancy. World Legacy Succession reborns a monster in a link zone to abuse of fusion monsters effects or spam the board, and World Legacy's Secret can lock some decks when going first thanks to it's ability to be searched out by Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star to negate several monsters effect in combination with Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse or just reborn an Artifact Scythe used for the fusion summon of Invoked Mechaba.  Shaddoll fusion is an excellent card for going second match ups since the opponent will almost always ends his turn with an extra deck monster, meaning that you'll be able to fusion summon an El Shaddoll monster using materials directly from the deck to trigger cards like Shaddoll Beast or Shaddoll Dragon to cycle your hand or suppress annoying backrow cards like Monarch Erupt. The El Shaddoll monster will consist on a link material for the summon of Aleister The Invoker Of Madness and will recycle the Shaddoll fusion when sent to the graveyard to gain a free discard target for Invoked Mechaba or Aleister The Invoker Of Madness effects.  Lastly to bypass most annoying boards when going second, we use 2 Mind Control And Instant Fusion to steal opponent's monsters and use them as link materials and gain access to higher link monsters more easily or just pressure the opponent's board by forcing out negates.  &nbsp;  The extra deck is made to use the full potential of fusion spaming effects with the Aleister The Invoker Of Madness engine. The shaddol engine countains 2 El Shaddoll Construct to maximise the card advantage generated by the Shaddoll Monsters discarded from the deck, 1 El Shaddoll Grysta to pressure boards in specific configurations by striking a special summon, and El Sheddol Winda to restrain the opponent to 1 special summon per turn and completely lock decks in combination with the Artifact engines and monsters like Invoked Mechaba.  The Invoked Engine plays Invoked Caliga to start boards with Instant Fusion in case of poor hand when starting first by preparing a target for Invoked Elysium, and can just contribute to fully lock opponent's first turn before setting an OTK. Invoked Mechaba can negate one card per turn and banish it, privating the opponents of destruction effects or secondary effects in the graveyard. Invoked Purgatrio is an axcellent finisher that gains rapidly Atk Following the size of the opponent's board, being a monster that can attack all monsters in the same battle phase with piercing damage. Lastly Invoked Elysium consume more ressources but consists on a formidable weapon against decks like Thunder Dragon by banihing all opponents board with himself or an Invoked monster of the graveyard.  Thousand-Eyes Restrict is a target for Instant Fusion when going second, it can steal annoying monsters and beatsticks. By equiping them to itself, it acts like a free starter for the summon of Mekk-Knight monsters.  Mekk-Knight of The Morning Star builds consistant board for going first games by setting a board that can negate 2 monster's effects and is hard to bypass by battle. Aleister The Invoker Of Madness is easy to summon thanks to the fair number of different types and attributes of monsters of the deck and acts like a spaming fusion machine for OTK boards.  Lastly Borreload dragon is an option to bypass the most resilient monsters and Borrelsword dragon is a good OTK generator if not using the Aleister The Invoker Of Madness combo.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The side deck :  Since this deck is already consistant when going first, the biggest part of the extra deck is designed to soften going second match ups.  Nibiru, the primal being is a Deadly weapon against combo decks like Guardragons that will able solid otks and add a free material for the summon of Aleister The Invoker Of Madness on our board.  Twin Twisters is a good way of Breaking backrow cards that can be annoying if there are too much stacked. It can also discard some cards like the Shaddoll monsters to generate a little card advantage.  A third Mind Control will be usefull against decks like Thuder Dragon that runs Colossus, a threat that lock effects of key cards like Aleister The Invoker.  Artifact Lancea is a searchable card to disable decks like Orcust, and can be used as fusion material for Invoked Mechaba and El Shaddoll Artifact.  Super Polymerization and Starving Venom Fusion Dragon can stop decks by suppressing 2 key monsters of a loop and generate a beatstick that will enable quick summoning of Aleister The Invoker Of Madness next turn.  Lastly Anti-Spell Fragrance and Imperial Order could seem couterproductive, but if starting first they can completely shut down Pendulums and Sky Strikers, specially in combination with our first turn board. In the worst cases, they can be used as cost for our monsters effects."

It seemed very competitive.  As it turned out, this deck was quite easy for me to get used to. It took me a lot less time than it's taking for me to learn decks like Thunder Dragon and Sky Striker. I've used this deck quite a lot now in Singles, and the occasional Matches in tournaments. I can see how this deck can be very annoying to play against, but at the same time I think I could really enjoy playing against this deck. Being able to beat a defensive board like this deck can set up can be very satisfying."

This deck has a high OTK potential while testing the deck I went 10-0 thanks to building big boards easily and people not really knowing what to do against Magister (at least the people I went against). A combo I found useful was to use the effect of Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm from the grave or normal summon to get a Supreme King Gate Zero from the deck. Then placing the Gate in the pendulum zone along with Servant, Chronograph, or Endymion. You can use the effect of Chronograph in the Pendulum Zone to special summon Timegazer to the field and replace the Chronograph with any other pendulum you want and then special summon with the Pendulum Zones. You can then summon Electrumite and use its effect to discard then to discard and add to hand. The second effect should be Master Cerberus or Endymion and then add them back to your hand. You can then Pendulum summon to swarm the field and summon Borrelsword and use its effect so it can attack twice which should be enough to finish off your opponent."

A good budget deck with some awesome techs.,"My new Tenyi Deck, post Ignition Assault. It's mostly a going first deck. You wanna bring either the Draco Master +  Berserker of the Tenyi or Monk + Draco Berserker on the field. Skilldrain is an awesome card, because you don't need most of your effects on the field, because the Tenyi trigger in the GY or hand. The Blue Eyes Ultimate is just for Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi. Waterfall of the Dragons, is your best draw card. Just throw up on of your Tenyi and draw 2 cards. Lost wind  is just one of my favourite current cards. It's awesome for going first, and very often saves your ass.  &nbsp;  Avramax and Unicorn are actually cards I use very rarely. They can probably go out for something different. They were just inside because of the scapegoat combo, wich comes also very rarely in this deck. Maybe a Borreload Savage Dragon would be an good option, but he's to expensive for me. By the way, this deck is very cheap."

Since this deck has high field swarming (yes Nibiru is a concern) I thought of using Guardragon Elpy to summon out Rafale, Champion Fur Hire from the Deck. Now you may be thinking how will you summon Elpy with no level 4 Dragons. Well just dump Destrudo to the Graveyard, but make sure you have Beat on the field to make destrudo a level 4. I have been trying to keep this deck going in locals, but with a tight budget to get cards I need is rough. Luckily Duel Devistastor released and I now have access to cards that I needed for a cheaper price. So with all this said I am gonna be testing out this theory of the deck. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

Eternal soul and Magician's navigation is more for if you already have a Dark Magician in hand and a Dark Magical Circle on the field. Apprentice Illusion Magician can be ran at either 2 or 3, its at 3 though because of Magician's naviagtion and spellbook of knowledge spellbook of Knowledge can also be ran at 2 or 3, or even 1 as its more of a situational card, but 2 would be best for the deck Inari Fire is at 2 for the link material, though you can only control 1 it makes for a good turn 1 summon, and even as a defence if you need it Curtian is in there as a free summon + circle, but can be used as apprentice discard for cost Illusion Magic works well with a Magican's navigation, or a Eternal soul. Best used with Circle on field The Extra deck is a BIT random, mainly the link monsters but you can switch out some of the Xyz monsters for another Ebon Illusion or Ebon High. Normally with The Eye Of Timaeus you want to go into Dark Magican the dragon knight, to protect your backrow and as a free removal with Dark Magical Circle Magician of dark illusion is a good combo with the traps or even a quick-play, as long as it isnt during the damage step. you can summon it in defence position to protect your lifepoints and banish a card if you have Magic Circle on the field"

Here we play techs to ensure spam to get access to a solid offensive board, and struggle against common aggro deck weaknesses like consistant backrows.  &nbsp;  So the monster engine countains the better Cyber Dragon monsters to spam the board and add consistancy to our starting hands. The original Cyber Dragon can special summon itsel from the hand if starting second and is the key monster of the loops due to it's name and level 5. Cyber Dragon Core is an amazing starter that sports the name Cyber Dragon on the field and in the graveyard like it's comrades to enable tuto spells to trigger easily, and can tuto a Cyber Dragon spell/trap when normal summoned to gain access to all our combos. It can restart boards in case of a non-successfull first turn by banishing itsel from the graveyard to special summon from the deck. Cyber Dragon Herz is the better discard target of the deck, since it can search or recycle a Cyber Dragon to keep our ressources up, and can more occasionnaly become level 5 when special summoned. Cyber Dragon Nachster pairs perfectly with Herz by discarding a monster to special summon itself then special summon a machine with 2100 Atk or Def from the graveyard, meaning Cyber Dragon and most of the extra deck.  Lastly Galaxy Soldier is usefull to summon xyz 5 monsters and is a free extra deck summon paired with Herz effect, and Jizukiru, The Star Destroying Kaiju will be a searchable tech to bypass Dangerous monsters with great stats/protection effect/disruption effect. Ash Blossom soften the going second match ups by negating a tuto and so restrainig the opponent's board.  &nbsp;  The spell and traps package is designed to develop the spam potential and ensure OTKs. Cyber Emergency and Cyber Repair Plant are must have cards that trigger a tuto effect to search all monsters of the deck and instantly gain access to starters/extenders/kaiju. Cyber Revsystem acts like a rebirn for Cyber Dragon and will be usefull to finish a board by summoning Cyber Dragon Sieger on a Qliphort Genius. Lastly Machine Duplication is an amazing extender that will automatically summon 2 Cyber Dragon from the deck since the little Cyber Dragon monsters gains the name ""Cyber Dragon"" on the field, we have a free link summon or xyz 5 summon.  To add consistancy we play Pot Of Desires to draw 2 cards almost freely and gain numerous options to better OTK. One For One will summon a monster by discarding another, so it can create card advantage thanks to Herz and enable explosive starts.  To fusion summon Cyber Dragons, Overload Fusion will banish monsters from the graveyard to fusion summon and wil pair well with Cyberload Fusion that can use banished monsters, these two cards consisting on a great OTK potential when played together.  To add defense we have Called By The Grave that protects our starters from monster hand traps, and Twin Twisters to break through backrows and take down fatal floodgates like There Can Be Only One or Monarch Erupt/Skill Drain.  &nbsp;  To absorb the countereffect of Cyber Dragon Nachster, the extra deck countains 14 machine monsters. Qliphort Genius can pressure a negate on the field and free 2 extra zones to assemble great boards. Cyber Dragon Sieger can give 2100 Atk to a Cyber Dragon monster to gain access to powerfull OTKs and protect key monsters from opponent's battlephases.  Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon acts like a pseudo kaiju to break powerfull monsters placed in the extra zone like Apollousa to build your boards more easily. Chimeratech Fortress Dragon can be used as a beatstick in critical situations, but most notably fuse the opponent's board, being a threat for decks like Orcusts and other Cyber Dragons. Chimeratech Rampage Dragon is the main offensive threat, it breaks backrow and gain access to 3 attacks by discarding key monsters from the deck like Herz and Core being a triple 4200 Atk monster thanks to Sieger. Cyber Twin Dragon is an alternative to Otk with a potential 4900 dual attack.  Cyber Dragon Nova is easy to summon and can revive a Cyber Dragon plus boost one of it's comrades, he is equally the slap target of Cyber Dragon Infinity that absorb attack position monsters and give a great neagtion effect to the board to protect OTKs and pressure opponent's turns.  Lastly Constellar Pleiades is an alternative before using Nachster effect to bounce cards and disrupt opponent's board, and Salamangreat Almiraj is a fair way to have a monster in the graveyard to trigger Cyber Repair Plant and protect an Infinity when starting first."
