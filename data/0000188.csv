Well this is simple to answer, they float when they are destroyed and dont care if they get banished or go to the GY so long as they are destroyed. They also like to link your opponents monsters away for your benefits for the best board breaking. Spells searches and the traps SS from GY or destroy 2 cards, no matter which way they are all good to use. Only 1 ""brick"" card in the archetype but the unchained monsters can special from hand or deck so its not too bad.

&nbsp;

<span><strong><span>Why Blind 2nd?:</span></strong></span>

Because this deck can link your opponents monsters away that is a good start for disrupting your opponents monster and clearing there beat sticks easily. Also Kaiju monsters are very good as you can tribute your opponents monster to the link with your own Kaiju, this is an ideal ""combo"" unless they have multiple difficult to out monsters. Also this deck uses some special spice, Super Poly. This is even more helpful to remove difficult monsters and works wonders in this deck, although targets are few and far between. Handtraps are essential for going 2nd, this is completely upto you which you run and what you can afford, i personally like the 2 Ash + 2 Ghost belle but you can change these about to suit your needs. (i know the video shows 3 Ash but its still a deck that is evolving and changing based on the meta)

&nbsp;

<span><strong>Can this deck go first instead?:</strong></span>

Technically, Yes. you can change your side deck to run trap trick and cards that are better for going first like IDP and solemn cards, however i prefer going 2nd.

Deck is nuts.,"This is such a complex deck lol

&nbsp;

-Normal Mo ye, make Chi xiao, search trap. If you already have it, search tactician.

Always use Tai A effect after special summoning him from the grave. Please, try not wasting your normal summon on him. Use his effect on ashuna, or send the trap so you can have banish it with Chi xiao and create a target for the trap you searched.

You can use adhara to add back your boys after you banish them up. Use ashuna to extend your plays or to create non-effect monsters.

&nbsp;

The entire deck is a toolbox since these boys can make pretty much any synchro from 6-12.

&nbsp;

Try always ending on Chi xiao, Baroness de fleur and the Sudden shift trap.

If you want, you can make Cheng ying instead of baroness and trade a Omni negate with a quick effect, non target banish from field and grave.

&nbsp;

For the love of god don't forget about the tenyi's requirments. Keep some tokens for ashuna, and don't forget that they lock you into wyrms.

Now extremely consistent with Pot of Prosperity! Slow down your opponent with handtraps the,"Windwitch Generaider combines the staying power of Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon with the resource generation of Generaider Bosses for a surprisingly competent grindy control deck. Since both deck cores are so small, you can easily slow down your opponent with 15+ handtraps then outgrind them with two strong engines! This deck may have 6 bricks, but worry not! There are 13 starters in this deck which provides access to Windwitch cards or Generaider Boss Stage. This deck is now extremely consistent with with Pot of Prosperity, allowing it to field its several one card starters to dominate the gamestate. This deck is composed of three types of cards: Windwitches, Generaiders, and Staples.

The <span><strong>Windwitch Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 5 cards: 3 <em>Ice Bell</em>, 2 <em>Glass Bell</em>, and 1 <em>Snow Bell</em>. The main reason for this engine is to give you a powerful wind synchro to reside in your EMZ, which typically is a ""immune to destruction"" Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon, which is a monster negate, + to send Wind Pegasus to the GY, giving you a powerful ""target and shuffle"" back into the deck removal once a card of yours is destroyed. Best of all, this is accomplished <em>without using your normal summon.</em>

The <strong>combo</strong> with this engine is fairly simple and straightforward.

1.The main starter here is Ice Bell, allowing itself to special summon from the hand if there are no monster cards on the field.

2.Ice Bell summons Glass Bell from deck, triggering both of their field effects at once (Glass Bell searches Snow Bell from deck and Ice Bell burns for 500. hint: Chainblock with Glass Bell as chain link 1 and Ice Bell as chain link 2 so they cannot handtrap/negate your Snow Bell search).

3. Summon Snowbell from the hand since you now fulfill it's special summoning requirement of controlling 2 wind monsters.

4. The level 7 synchro you summon using Icebell + Snowbell depends on your choice. Usually you summon Wind Pegasus to destroy an opponent's backrow with it's effect, and allow for a potential ""shuffle an opponent's card back into the deck"" effect when a card of yours is destroyed. You can also summon Winter Bell if you want to give Diamond Bell its ""twice"" per turn destruction effect.

5. Finally, you summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon into the Extra Monster Zone (to allow more space for generaider tokens) using your level 7 synchro + Snow Bell. Using Snow Bell, your synchro monster is now immune to destruction effects, which makes it very annoying to out. You can also summon Diamond Bell for it's board breaking capability (it can destroy up to two cards on the field with it's effect.)

The <span><strong>Generaider Engine</strong></span> is comprised of 15 cards. The main goal of this engine is to allow access to Boss Stage so you can begin the Generaider grind game vs. your opponent. Once your opponent draws a card, you can begin summon Boss Monsters from the deck.

1. <strong>There are 10 ways to get Boss Stage</strong> out of a 40 card deck, giving you a very good chance of seeing an active Boss Stage for your opponent's turn. First, there are the three copies of Boss Stage itself. 3 Generaider Boss Fight activates as a archetypal ""metaverse,"" activating Boss Stage from the deck or GY. 3 Loptr acts as another copy of Boss Stage by tributing itself to special summon Mardel, which searches out Boss Stage. Finally, Terraforming searches out Boss Stage from the deck.

2. There are <strong>5 maindeck ""Big"" Generaider Bosses</strong>. <em>Mardel </em>searches any generaider card, which our target is typically Boss Stage. <em>Hela</em> is a monster reborn for any Generaider or zombie (notably ash blossom, then you can link up to Accesscode from there using Halq) in the GY. <em>Dovelgus</em> unclogs your hand if it's too full of bricky Generaider monsters. <em>Utgarda</em> is targeted spot removal in a form of a quick effect banish for two tributes. The main boss monster you'll summon is <em>Harr</em>, which functions as a omni-negate. Also, if you opponent adds a card to their hand (except during the draw step), they will have to discard a monster from their hand as well, which certainly messes up combo decks as well.

The rest of this deck is comprised of<strong><span> staple cards</span>. </strong>

The recent creation of <em>Pot of Prosperity</em> is part of the reason this deck is viable - it allows access to one card starters like Ice Bell or Boss Stage to give access to two separate engines. Before this card, this deck ran a serious problem of bricking disastrously since it runs 6 bricks (5 generaider bosses + Psy-Frame Driver), or only having access to one side of the deck rather than both Windwitch and Generaiders. Thanks to this card, you can see both much muuuuch more consistently! When this card gets reprinted at a cheaper price, I'm totally buying a playset!

After consistency cards like Pot of Prosperity, Terraforming and Called By the Grave, there are 15 spaces for staples. You can run any handtrap to match the meta, but here are my personal must-haves since they compliment the deck so well:

1.The ""Solemn"" package of Solemn Strike and Judgement are there since this deck wants to go first. With these cards in the backrow as you go first complimented by Crystal Wing and Harr, you will lose less likely to common blowout boardbreakers like Nibiru, Lightning Storm and Ash.

2. 3 Psy-Frame Gamma + Driver helps insulate your lines of play vs. Ash. This card is usually live when you summon from deck, since both engines activate with no monsters on board (Ice Bell activates from the hand and Boss Stage is a spell). It's like a pseudo Called By The Grave to help guarantee you can establish the board. Also, this card is a devastating card to play when you negate  destroy your opponent's card at an essential choke point of their combo!

3. 3 Ash is always relevant. Counters all the pots, destroys deck searches, etc. Nuff' said.

In the side deck, you have combo killers like Dimension Shifter (This deck can function almost unhindered by the card!) Lancea (for Dino/Virtual World) and Droll &amp; Lockbird (For Drytron/Dragon Link). There are also Feather Duster and Twin Twisters to destroy backrow decks like Altergeist, Eldlich and Sky Strikers running around.

<span><strong>General Tips - </strong></span>I play tested this a lot in Yugioh OMEGA, even reaching top 30 with this deck! It's surprisingly competent. Here are the things I've learned about it.
<ul>
 	<li>If you already have Generaiders on the field, they may easily tribute themselves so that the field can be empty. Ice Bell will be then able to special summon itself from the hand since your field is empty, also, Psy-Frame Gamma is live.</li>
 	<li>Games with this deck tend to end after 1-2 turns. You generally handtrap your opponent to a standstill, and they still have to face down high atk/def dangerous boss monsters with negates like Crystal Wing and Harr.</li>
 	<li>If you are facing a Link/XYZ monster with ridiculously high attack (Crystal Wing's attack boosting effect isn't live since these type of monsters don't have levels), you can negate/destroyed your own monster with Crystal Wing, boost it's own attack with your own destroyed monster, and hit over your opponent's monster. This came in clutch when facing down a 6000 atk Arrival @Cybverse and a 5300 attack Accesscode.</li>
 	<li>Opponents spend every single resource trying to out Boss Stage, often neglecting other things on your board, like your boss monsters, handtraps or facedown backrow. Use this psychological trick to your advantage! Opponents get so disheartened when you simply activate another Boss Stage to replace it.</li>
 	<li>You can tribute your own Generaider monsters to activate their effects (novice players tend to forget this.) It's fine if you tribute them, you can just revive them next turn with Hela anyways.</li>
 	<li>Summon Loptr with Generaider Boss Stage first to give all your Generaider monsters and tokens an attack boost. Opponents tend to attack the low ATK tokens since they're a weak point in your defense. Tribute them before they get a chance to!</li>
 	<li>If one of your Generaider monsters get negated or rendered useless, you can tribute it with Loptr to summon another Generaider Boss from deck, giving you another form of interaction.</li>
 	<li>Summon Loptr instead of Harr is kind of a greedy play if you have no form of negation on board (Like Crystal Wing/Solemns), since they can easily Nibiru you, Imperm/Veiler Loptr upon effect activation, etc. Keep this in mind when making your board!</li>
 	<li>Be aware of being locked into WIND! If you have normal summoned Loptr after you summon Crystal Wing using Windwitches, you're locked into wind for the rest of the turn so you cannot summon light attribute Mardel to search out Boss Stage. If you intend to summon Accesscode using Halq, do not activate Glass Bell's effect after you summon her with Halq, since it locks you to wind rendering the combo line null and void.</li>
 	<li>You can summon Ash (since it's a zombie) from the GY with Hela, which grants you access to Halq -&gt; Accesscode.</li>
</ul>
<span><strong>Concluding Commentary</strong></span>

Whether you go first or second, this deck consistently (thanks to Port of Prosperity) pumps out a board of Crystal Wing (monster negate). Harr (omni-negate), and Wind Pegasus in the GY (shuffle back opponent's card into deck upon card destruction). You often have set-solemns and hand traps like Ash/Gamma. Going second? No problemoooo, you have 15 handtraps you can jam into your deck since the two engines are so small! Your opponent's board is so weak you can easily set-up your bosses to outgrind and defeat your opponent with!

The gameplay is tempo based, where you go for 1 for 1 trades vs. your opponent until you come out on top because of Generaider Boss Stages sheer grind power and free resource generation every turn. Crystal Wing's monster negate, destruction protection, attack boosting ability is incredibly effective as well! It's not too complicated with it's combos which is perfect for duelists who just want to play Yugioh without worrying about messing up their complex combo/gameplay (like me lmao). I just hope this deck becomes a bit more affordable in the future, because Pot of Prosperity is incredibly expensive. I also like the concept of Bosses and Dragons, since I'm a big fan of RPGs like Dark Souls, Skyrim and Final Fantasy, and this deck brings it to life for me. All in all, this grindy control deck is very fun, refreshing and new! I hope you have as much fun as I do piloting this deck online or IRL. GLHF Duelists!

Book of moon to stop some combos and xyz climbing.

Parrallel eXceed good for going into dweller, splash mage or triggering Sunlight Wolf. Cut from 3 to 2 because 3 was chunking.

I like 3 spinny for the grindy games.

I decided to name this card after the theme song of an old video game I had as a kid, <em>Sonic and The Black Knight. </em>I was a major Sonic the Hedgehog fan as a preteen.

&nbsp;

Anyways, this deck is good going first or second. If you're going first, just summon Crystal Wing or Crystal Clear Wing and set Speedroid Dupligate. If you're going second, use your 9 hand traps to disrupt your opponent's plays so you can OTK them on your turn."

A Monster Mash WATER deck...","""Within the depths of the ocean, there exists three tribes of merfolk. The first, clad in armor, fight against their oppression. The second, soldiers that betrayed the rulers of Atlantis to aid the rebellious merrows. The third hail from a group of troubadours that seek to bring joy through song.

Through their combined might, they call upon the powers of their sacred treasures, the harmonies of the Deep Sea will creatures of the alabaster seas. The Atlantean traitors will support from afar, aiming to bring down the tyranny of Porseidra. The Mermail in turn shall serve as the face of their resistance, as they fight Poseidra's forces and draw their ire away from their allies. Together, they will break their fetters.""

The idea is Synchro Mermail. or that was the basis of it at least, but As the ED can attest I haven't quite shunned Xyz monsters. The Mermail are capable of swarming the field largely in part to <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssteus"">Abyssteus</a>' power, as well as that of <a data-name=""Mermail Abysshilde"">Abysshilde</a>, <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssgunde"">Abyssgunde</a> and <a data-name=""Neptabyss, the Atlantean PRince"">Neptabyss</a>. The Mermails and Atlanteans both have effects that proc when discarded which allows them to synergize decently enough. The Deep Sea Tuners, <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Diva</a> in particular, allow for Neptabyss plays and Synchro access. <a data-name=""Moulinglacia, the Elemental Lord"">Moulinglacia, the Elemental Lord</a> is there because its searchable and I'm certain combos exist to get just the right amount of Water monsters for it in the GY. Also worh noting is the Genex Package that can turn the NS into a Lin-2 with <a data-name=""Crystron Rosenix"">Crystron Rosenix</a>'s token.

For the more unusual on-theme monsters. <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssdine"">Abyssdine</a> is there because the little clionid is my favorte, but also becuase she serves as an extender with Abyssalacia's effect, <a data-name=""Mermail Abysshilde"">Abysshilde</a> is there because I also run her sisters <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssgunde"">Abyssgunde</a> and <a data-name=""Mermail Abysshilde"">Abysshilde</a>. More questionable is <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssmander"">Abyssmander</a>, while he helps with Synchro and sometimes Xyz plays, he's mainly here because of the Very Fun Dragon...who is now banned and pending a replacement with a certain Level 7 Synchro soon, plus I also have <a data-name=""Guitar Grunards Duonigis"">Guitar Grunards Duonigis</a> for level modulation. Also questionable is <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssleed"">Abyssleed</a> and <a data-name=""Mermail Abyssbalean"">Abyssbalean</a>, but the former at least has a use with the side deck. The lone spell is <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> which has the obvious purpose of procing effects like Neptabyss and Abysshilde (might replace with <a data-name=""Light of Sekka"">Light of Sekka</a>, but then again maybe not).

The Extra Deck as noted, is focused on Synchros but with some Link and Xyz monsters thrown in for good measure. <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a> is there as a generic way to get to <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>. I'm also planning to run a suite of Synchro Tuners to make the players easier such as <a data-name=""Tatsunoko"">Tatsunoko</a> (Made with Diva and Neptabyss and can use a Level 7 if they otherwise brick the hand), Crystron Quandax (Which can allow for Accell Synchro-like shenanigans), Coral Dragon and Deep Sea Prima Donna (the card pending to replace Calamities, also makes the Level 3s better and grans a monster some much needed protection). The ideal plays would be involving the White Aura monsters, especially <a data-name=""White Aura Biphamet"">Biphamet</a> and with Quandax, <a data-name=""White Aura Whale"">Whale</a>. I know what you're thinking and yes I'll eventually get <a data-name=""Crystron Halifibrax"">Crystron Halifibrax</a> to repalce another Link (Likely <a data-name=""Underclock Taker"">Underclock Taker</a>). And yes I do run each of the Mermail ED mosnters.

The side deck is admittedly haphazard, currently holding 9 cards ATM (Veiler and Twin are palceholders) and they all are the Abyss-scales. I could probably do a bit better, maybe I can side the Abyssleed and Pankratops to make room for the minstrels (or replace the sleeves)

It was a deck I built a few years back and I had prioritized recent decks so bear with me here. Its also way monster heavy due to the amount of WATER goodstuff there is.

I hope you enjoy!

3x <strong><a data-name=""Chamber Dragonmaid"">Chamber Dragonmaid</a></strong>: Obvious choice for the pure dragonmaid deck. A very good combo with <a data-name=""Parlor Dragonmaid"">Parlor Dragonmaid</a> and <a data-name=""World Legacy Guardragon"">World Legacy Guardragon</a>.

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragonmaid Lorpar&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragonmaid Lorpar</strong></a>: A very good boss monster. Handtrap negates, and the second effect also bounces for a Lv. 3 Dragonmaid monster (Parlor or Kitchen).

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragonmaid Tinkhec&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragonmaid Tinkhec</strong></a>: Another nice boss monster. Handtrap activates as an extra 2000 ATK.

3x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Parlor Dragonmaid&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Parlor Dragonmaid</strong></a>: Searches to GY any Dragonmaid monster. I suggest Kitchen or Chamber Dragonmaid because of their searches and easy boss monster summons.

3x <strong><a data-name=""Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a></strong>: A simple negate on deck searches. Don't use it on yourself. You can summon Vampire Sucker with it.

2x <strong><a data-name=""Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion"">Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion</a></strong>: A simple negate and shutdown of GY effects. You can run 2x.

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Nurse Dragonmaid&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Nurse Dragonmaid</strong></a>: A GY summoner.

2x <strong><a data-name=""Dragonmaid Changeover"">Dragonmaid Changeover</a></strong>: A fusion for Dragonmaids, bounces back with another Dragonmaid. Run 2 if your opponent banishes it.

2x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragonmaid Hospitality&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragonmaid Hospitality</strong></a>: A summon from the GY or hand in defense. Also a <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial for Dragonmaids.</a>

2x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Lightning Storm</strong></a>: A going-second card. Great removal.

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragonmaid Downtime&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragonmaid Downtime</strong></a>: Bounces spells and traps on opponent's side or bounces a Dragonmaid monster for the search of a Dragonmaid monster.

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Imperial Order&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Imperial Order</strong></a>: Anti-spell card. Use for Mystic Mine or other field spells.

2x <strong><a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a></strong>: A negate of a monster effect or special summon. Pays 1500 LP.

3x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Dragonmaid Tidying&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Dragonmaid Tidying</strong></a>: Bouncing dragons and opponent's monsters. I recommend using for very strong extra deck monsters or a setup monster.

2x <strong>House Dragonmaid</strong>: Destroys a card every time you bounce a monster.

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Borreload Savage Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong></a>: A boss monster from the Extra Deck. Good for negating.

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Borrelsword Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Borrelsword Dragon</strong></a>: A nice boss monster from the Extra Deck. Doesn't help the archetype but is a good monster for attacks.

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Accesscode Talker&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Accesscode Talker</strong></a>: A generally good Link monster. Doesn't require too much to get out, useful if used in tandem with another link monster (like <a data-name=""Vampire Sucker"">Vampire Sucker</a>).

1x <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Vampire Sucker&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Vampire Sucker</strong></a>: A +1 draw against handtraps with Halqifibrax.

I've chosen more of a control strategy for this deck as it plays into the strengths of Bufferlo and Desires.

This deck plays a Budget 2-Card OTK (not Accesscode) that gets rid of 3 cards in the process, you just need to see Gazelle and one of Spinny or Foxy.
<ol>
 	<li>Normal summon Spinny (or Foxy)</li>
 	<li>Link summon Balelynx using Spinny (or Foxy)</li>
 	<li>Chainlink 1 special summon Gazelle from hand, Chainlink 2 activate Balelynx effect to grab Sanctuary from your deck</li>
 	<li>Activate Gazelle effect to send Will to grave</li>
 	<li>Activate Spinny effect in grave (or Foxy by sending a Salamangreat card from your hand to grave and there will need to be a face-up spell/trap card on the field which you can use Sanctuary for) to special summon itself to the field (if using Foxy you can pop an opponents face-up spell/trap card)</li>
 	<li>XYZ summon Miragestallio using Gazelle and Spinny (or Foxy)</li>
 	<li>Activate Miragestallio effect (locks you into fire monsters for rest of turn) by detaching Gazelle then special summon Jack Jaguar from your deck in defence position</li>
 	<li>Link summon Sunlight Wolf using Balelynx and Miragestallio, then use Miragestallio effect to spin an opponents monster back to their hand (or extra deck)</li>
 	<li>Link summon another copy of Sunlight Wolf using Sunlight Wolf and Jack Jaguar</li>
 	<li>Activate Sunlight Wolf effect to add Will from your grave to your hand</li>
 	<li>Activate Jack Jaguar effect in grave to send Sunlight Wolf in grave back to the extra deck to special summon Jack Jaguar under your Sunlight Wolf, then activate Sunlight Wolf effect to add Gazelle from grave to hand</li>
 	<li>Link summon Heatleo using Sunlight Wolf and Jack Jaguar, then use Heatleo's effect to spin one if your opponents backrow back to their deck</li>
 	<li>Activate Sanctuary from hand</li>
 	<li>Link summon another copy of Heatleo using Sanctuary effect, then use Heatleo's effect again to spin another one of your opponents backrow back to their deck</li>
 	<li>Activate Heatleo's other effect changing one of your opponents attack position monsters to the same attack as Balelynx (your lowest monsters attack in grave) which is 500</li>
 	<li>Activate Will from hand, then choose it's second effect sending Will to the grave targeting Heatleo to special summon 3 Salamangreat monsters from your grave in defence position: Spinny (or Foxy), Jack Jaguar, and Miragestallio</li>
 	<li>Link summon Proxy Magician using Spinny (or Foxy) and Jack Jaguar</li>
 	<li>Activate Proxy Magician effect to fusion summon Violet Chimera using Proxy Magician and Miragestallio</li>
 	<li>Activate Violet Chimera effect to add half the attack of the materials used for its fusion summon which will be 1700 making it's new attack 4,500</li>
 	<li>Use Violet Chimera to attack the monster changed to 500 attack through Heatleo's effect, where you activate Violet Chimera's second effect to double its attack when battling a monster that's attack is different from its original attack, making Violet Chimera's attack 9000, swinging for 8,500 damage, and that is game.</li>
</ol>
You are doing this combo under the protection of Balelynx once it's in the grave and if it doesn't go through you've got your grave set up for next turn, as well as Gazelle back in hand plus 4 other cards to work with (6 if you use Bufferlo for the normal summon sending Spinny or Foxy to grave).

Going first you are trying to dig into your traps and get Bagooska onto your field as it's a hell of a card. I side in anti-spell going first which if you can pair this with a Bagooska and set Roar it's going to be a hell of a board to break as your negating all spell effects, monster effects on field (except link monsters but that's where Roar and Solemn's come in), and your opponents monsters can't attack (except Link). I have weighed up between Dweller and Rasterliger but opt for Rasterliger (the wish Accesscode) because it helps you win games whereas Dweller is circumstantial. Torrential Tribute is a 1 way nuke as Balelynx will protect your monsters, and Gozen Match is one of the most underrated floodgates as it will stop just about every meta deck if flipped at the right chokepoint, and if you get hit with Nibiru you can flip Gozen then they are locked into light monsters only which stops just about every meta deck except Drytron.

One last thing, Falco can pull off some amazing plays, one of my favourites is if you have Sunlight Wolf, Balelynx, set Rage, and Gazelle in hand (fairly common and achievable set-up) you can use the first effect of Rage to pop your Balelynx then popping one of your opponents cards, then because a Salamangreat monster is hitting the grave you can special summon Gazelle under your Sunlight Wolf where Gazelle will send Falco to grave and Sunlight Wolf will activate to add a fire monster from grave to hand (Foxy, Spinny Jack Jaguar, Bufferlo, Ash if you play it), then Falco will activate its effect in grave to reset Rage back to your field. Then on your turn you can activate Rage again to pop 2 more cards of your opponents (3 if you climb into Heatleo) as well as activating Falco's effect in grave to send Gazelle back to your hand and then you can normal (or special if another Salamangreat monster hits the grave) summon Gazelle back to your field triggering it's effect again to send another card to your grave. This play is extremely effective in your opponents end phase as they can't really follow up, overall Falco get's you at least one extra pop with Rage and at least a plus 3 in resources. If you play Dweller you can do a similar play where if you activate Roar or Rage before activating Dweller's effect, once Dweller detaches Jack Jaguar, Gazelle will activate in hand, sending Falco to reset Roar, and repeating everything else."
