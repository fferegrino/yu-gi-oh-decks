The Synergy is obvious! Dangers discard fableds, fableds trigger and drop on a field. Oh and some Fabled monsters are tuners Hi Needlefiber. This is futuristic build of Fableds because they ll be a serious perhaps even a rouge deck once fiber drops. Sure some Dangers might get semi-limited or limited by that time but thats ok.

Do you like dangers? Do you like synchros? This is a perfect deck for you

Here is the deck in action <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98qDf16-knQ</a> and below are card explanations.

&nbsp;

<strong>Engine: MONSTER Starters and extenders</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a></strong> - searches entire deck luckly the deck isn't to normal summon reliant (she is limited).</li>
 	<li><strong>3x <a data-name=""Salamangreat Gazelle"">Salamangreat Gazelle</a></strong> - a 1 card Mirage stalio at worst. The best salamangreat monster.</li>
 	<li><strong>3x <a data-name=""Salamangreat Spinny"">Salamangreat Spinny</a></strong> - Do play 3, it has synergy with cynet mining and you always wanna draw it.</li>
 	<li><strong>3x <a data-name=""Salamangreat Foxy"">Salamangreat Foxy</a></strong> - Normal summon of the deck. But you can also use it for the second effect in order to make a R3 by the end of a combo (bamboozle) just make sure not to pop your own fieldspell XD.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Salamangreat Jack Jaguar"">Salamangreat Jack Jaguar</a></strong> - Typically summoned under Sunlight Wolf, helps with R4 plays. He is what I call a perfect powerful one off.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Salamangreat Falco"">Salamangreat Falco</a></strong> - He is sort of a diff version of Jack jaguar (Sort of why you only play one of each). Another level 4 which revives himself, but he can also retrieve your Salamangreat spells/traps from the graveyard.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Salamangreat Fowl"">Salamangreat Fowl</a></strong> - He is a free level 4 (key level) Monster Drop. He increases the deck ceiling with him in a deck you can end on multiple traps + r4 like baguska with high consistency. He is quite searchable and 1 is all you need. He can also send Salamangreat monsters from the hand to the graveyard (Which is sometimes handier then the actual not once per turn effect) to prevent your opponent from activating set cards.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Salamangreat Meer"">Salamangreat Meer</a></strong> - a free monster drop which isn't correct level. With Dugales in a game he gets a slight boost because dugales can draw into him or 3x circle / 3x mining. Still a great OPT extender.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Flame buffalo"">Flame buffalo</a></strong> - Just 1 because I prefer summoning foxy/debug. You don't need no more.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Salamangreat  Foxer"">Salamangreat  Foxer</a></strong>. We are in a backrow heavy format, she combos well with Heatleo and foxy. Better of going second, This deck between Fowl, foxer, foxy and Heatleo has ridicilus backrow hate.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Backup Secretary"">Backup Secretary</a></strong> - can be another handtrap if one wishes. She is a free level 3 cyberse drop, and no she doesn't overlap with Mirage stalio restriction as she doesn't activate.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x <a data-name=""Crusadia Reclusia"">Crusadia Reclusia</a> - </strong>a free level 3 fire effect monster Drop which can pop anything She can be another handtrap if one wishes because there is lots of anti destruction specifically in this format. Granted I am not satisfied with many handtraps.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Going second cards </strong>- I am running just 9 so in average you should see slightly more then 1 per hand. Some salamangreat engine monsters such as Reclusia, Fowl, Foxie and foxer are already good going second cards. The deck can play through board to an extent so I didnt go for to many going first hate.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>2x</strong> <strong>effect veiler -</strong> better then Impermanence so that deck doesn't become to fragile to reboot.</li>
 	<li><strong>3x ash blossom -</strong> Sunlight wolf can add it to the hand. Sometimes you even use it for linking / r3 plays.</li>
 	<li><strong>2x droll - </strong>just a good handtrap.</li>
 	<li><strong>2x <a data-name=""super polymerization"">super polymerization</a></strong> - for Salamangreat Violer Chimera and Starving Venom Fusion Dragon.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The best cards in the deck</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>3x <a data-name=""Salamangreat circle"">Salamangreat circle</a></strong> - A quickplay searcher which can be retrieved back with Sunlight wolf and falco, it can also protect your links which you need on a field to maximize your trap threat.</li>
 	<li><strong>3x <a data-name=""Cynet mining"">Cynet mining</a></strong> - Discard salamanagreat &gt; search gazelle &gt; special summon gazelle because you just discarded a salamangreat. This card says special summon gazelle from the deck. Fantastic card.</li>
 	<li><strong>1x Foolish burial </strong>- there are like 5 good targets or so and some people aren't playing this card. It often times sends spinny so that gazelle can send a trap.</li>
 	<li>1x <strong><a data-name=""Salamangreat hearth"">Salamangreat hearth</a></strong> - holy fk this card is scarry good. It can summon monsters from the hand / grave each turn or mass summon if your Link monsters are ""Lets say Geminilink summoned"".</li>
 	<li>1x <strong><a data-name=""Fury of fire"">Fury of fire</a></strong> (Its a salamangreat card) - This card is not out yet in a TCG but in short its like another version of Salamangreat hearth. So just play 2 hearth till we get this card. Oh and the restrictions on this card don't matter because it says ""<strong>for</strong>"" the rest of this turn and it usually gives you a free r4 / r3 at the end of a combo or gives you a comeback / follow up  / otk play... quite versitaile card.</li>
 	<li>Salamangreat Sanctuary - People call this card a brick but what it allows is really powerful. In short you can summon the same salamangreat on top of that same salamangreat and then your other salamangreat cards and that monster have bonus effects (I call it Geminilink summon).</li>
 	<li>1x Salamangreat Rage - Pops bunch of card can be milled then added back with Falco, Sunlight Wolf.</li>
 	<li>2x Salamangreat Roar - Countertrap which negates anything. Can set itself if you ""Geminilink summon"" your link.</li>
</ul>
<strong>EXTRA deck</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Salamangreat Violer Chimera. Super poly destroys a mirror match, I am siding fusion of fire. OTK card</li>
 	<li>Starving venom fusion dragon. Super poly target for Thunderdragon / Orcust boards</li>
 	<li>Number 41. I reccomend siding dweller when he is bad but he is such an annoying card to deal with</li>
 	<li><strong><a data-name=""Number 60. Dugales of Forgotten time"">Number 60: Dugales of Forgotten time</a> - A REASON WHY THIS BUILD IS FUTURISTIC  </strong>Dugales can extend your plays with first effect which triggers falco btw<strong>, </strong>or he can revive Tapir for lulz. And it can also help you OTK with his last doubling attack effect. Until he gets out I reccomend update jammer combo for OTK</li>
 	<li>Salamangreat mirage stalio - An invoker for Salamangreat which also acts as monster removal. Only 1 because Jack jaguar keeps puting him back in the deck</li>
 	<li>Bamboozle - he bamboozles monster effects and makes both players draw a card. R3 Distruption</li>
 	<li>Borreload - to out problematic stuff</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""2x Salamangreat Heatleo"">2x Salamangreat Heatleo</a> - Outs backrow, manipulates the attack of one monster on the field if Geminilinksummoned (Ofc you need more then 1 to geminilinksummon)</li>
 	<li>3x <a data-name=""Sunlight Wolf"">Sunlight Wolf</a> - This is the most important Salamangreat card. He ensures you have a follow up play for the next turn usually by adding back gazelle unless falco bounces her, also he sets up your backrow</li>
 	<li>2x <a data-name=""Veilynx"">Veilynx</a> - you do need 2 for the combos sometimes. There is no space for the third. she can protect your salamangreat monsters from destruction</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Hiita the blazing fire charmer"">Hiita the blazing fire charmer</a> - she is a shortcut for Heatle if your opponent has a fire monster in the gravyeard, upon being destroyed she searches fire monsters</li>
</ul>
<strong>Side deck</strong>

Side deck should be, 1 fusion of fire to otk going second, mystic mine hate, handtraps for combo decks, dweller instead of 41, Knightmare phoenix if you are up against heavy and I mean heavy backrow deck

&nbsp;

Salamangreats have fantastic battle manipulator Raccoon. this card can fk up any deck which wants to gain advantage in battlephase or Otk you. So this can be sided against Trains, Lunalight, and Crusadia to stop the Otks or against Idk deskbot 004 Esque monsters. I rec siding one because if you ever notice a match-up he ll work in you ll be able to access him since he is searchable.

Salamangreats also have fantastic comeback card. Salamangreat Mole. He can help you comeback after evenly / double exciton effect. so in a matchups where the opponent blows up your board why not have this card in a sidedeck to combat this

Below you ll find explanation for every card in Isolde database. This list can help you invest in cards. I recc reading it because there wasn't enough space in a deck for all the relevant warriors.

 	<li>Marmiting Captain &gt; Channel YugiMoto out of yourself reveal a warrior &gt; Isolde</li>

 	<li><strong>The PK silent boots</strong> - if you control a bardiche (happens often so mentioned)</li>
 	<li>Overlay booster - if you control a 2000 atk monster</li>
 	<li>T.G Striker / DODODO Buster / Heroic challenger Assault Halberd / Lord gaia the fierce knight / GillaGillancer / Elder of the six samurai / GillaGillalancer (Tbh he is good in six sam as long as invoker is legal), <strong>they can all be summoned if you dont and your opponent does control a monster</strong>. DIFF levels (Most are Outclased)</li>
 	<li>Doggy Diver - if your opponent controls a monster and you control only and atleast 1 level 4</li>

 	<li><strong>Lightray grepher - banish a level 5 or higher. He is alike Dark grepher but for banish zone massive potentional good investment.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Empowerment</strong> - A fieldspell which summons Pendulum warriors from deck by discarding a card</li>
 	<li>Big one warrior - send a level 1 monster to the graveyard to SS him</li>
</ul>
<strong>The best summons off Isolde</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Dawn Knight</strong> - might get OP in future sends a light monster to the graveyard when he is sent there</li>
 	<li><strong>Brushfire knight</strong> - might get OP in future. When fire monster is destroyed send fire monster from the deck to the graveyard. when he is destroyed do the same</li>
 	<li><strong>Hero kid</strong> - I recc going into Mannequin cat after</li>
 	<li><strong>Arma / Vyon / Grepher</strong> - all can send mali. 2 of them can send dark monsters. Vyon can search poly</li>
 	<li><strong>Elemental hero Prisma </strong>- its just interesting this card can be accessed from deck</li>
 	<li>Attack gainer (Just a level 1 earth warrior tuner &gt; ez natbeast)</li>
 	<li><strong>Doppel warrior</strong> - I mean doppel has massive potentional to even get banned trust me.</li>
 	<li><strong>Junk Collector</strong> - Banishes itself and one normal trap from the graveyard to use its effect (Condition and requirements must be correct but holy thats cool)</li>
 	<li>Dragonox - he can revive but to face down position</li>
 	<li>Altitude Knight - when monster is bounced send a wind monster from deck (some potentional)</li>
 	<li>Shore knight - when his battle position is changed send a water monster from deck (some potentional) maybe with Karkakuris</li>
 	<li>A/D changer - level 1 which changes battle position. I saw this card see some play.</li>
 	<li>Dark Scorpion Chick the Yellow - anyone wants some loops=???</li>
 	<li>Great shogun shien - if you are a madman who plays 7 equips. Maybe in a year 2o25 when we finally get good equips.</li>
</ul>
Overall Knight cards are worth investing in. Aside from Dust knight I didn't mention which has Flip based earth mill.

<strong>The best equips for warriors (Quite certain nothing else ll see play)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Phoenix blade</strong> &gt; Free discard, Dystopia triggerer, Banishes BLS ritual support monsters triggering their search effects, free revive for zepyhros</li>
 	<li><strong>D.D.R</strong> &gt; not once per turn, Zephyros and powertool synergy often revives not once per turn Arma</li>
 	<li><strong>Moon mirror shield</strong> &gt; card which can return to the deck. Decent overall</li>
 	<li><strong>Sword of Deap Seated</strong> &gt; card which stays in deck no matter the discards / mills / being sent to grave</li>
 	<li><strong>Overdone Burial</strong> &gt; Equips are kinda bad, semi decent revival</li>
 	<li><strong>Living fossil &gt; </strong>see above (Lots of Warrior equips feel like just worse monster reborn)</li>
 	<li><strong>Autonomous action unit &gt; </strong>revives opponents monsters, got better with time due to handtraps</li>
 	<li><strong>Cursed bamboo sword / bamboo sword</strong> &gt; can be used with golden bamboo sword for draw power</li>
 	<li><strong>Axe of fools</strong> &gt; negate a monster effect (A budget forbidden chalice)</li>
 	<li><strong>Noble arms Arfeudutyr</strong> &gt; Some backrow hate</li>
 	<li><strong>Snatch steal &gt; its banned but it can honestly come back</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Second coming of the monarchs</strong> &gt;  Isolde monarchs are a thing, it revives monarch stat monster</li>
 	<li><strong>Galaxy zero &gt; </strong>Galaxy photon decks can spam Isolde and they already have decent equip. revives galaxy / photon monster</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Photon Warrior spam engine</strong>

Photon trasher, galaxy braver, photon vanisher, photon advancer, accelight, photon lizard, Overlay booster, Guardian of order (Altho guardian ain't needed dropped it with braver in game) By playing bunch of this you ll have a bunch 2 card Isolde combos. I suggest summoning Hero Kid off Isolde

&nbsp;

<strong>The best cards to search off Isolde</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Dragonox - Underated LL combo well with Appolousa. stops battlephase</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Necro gardna -</strong> stops 1 attack but he is quite resiliant card and worth discarding unlike dragonox</li>
 	<li><strong>Black luster soldier</strong> - Do I have to explain the BLS</li>
 	<li><strong>Super agent - </strong>Some backrow removal + by that time you ll know what you are up against so higher Pegasus predictions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Silent swordsman</strong> - a searchable spell negator is nice</li>
 	<li><strong>Lightray gearfried</strong> - So much restrictions but maybe he ll find his place someday</li>
 	<li>Destiny hero Plasma - if you are a madman who thinks he ll have enough to facilitate him next turn</li>
</ul>

There are 18 one card Ftk combos in this deck. All hail the IB and Gandora-x. I don't see whats stoping this deck from taking some tour,"Here is a video because motion is more then words but below I ll explain each card <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3P1yGAaQek</a>

&nbsp;

Cruical thing. As long as you can make IB and put a dragon vannila in the graveyard you have an FTK

&nbsp;

<strong>1 CARD FTKS (18)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Treasure Pander - as long as you can put a 1 spell in the graveyard he is an FTK. Note he can even do more as he is not OPT. There are enough spells to facilitate him most of them even draw</li>
 	<li>Cynet mining / Draconet - summon a lvl 2 vannila &gt; you can summon the IB &gt; proceed to FTK</li>
 	<li>Lonefire / Scorpio &gt; search instant fusion &gt; cerubini &gt; send &gt; carboneddon &gt; carboneddon summons a normal tuner him + monster off instant fusion = IB &gt; proceed with guardragon stuff for FTK</li>
 	<li>Fossil Dig / Oviraptor &gt; send carboneddon &gt; summon lvl 1 dragon vanila  &gt; IB</li>
 	<li>Summoner Monk + spell &gt; oviraptor / plant route / treasure pander route</li>
 	<li>Mathematician &gt; carboneddon &gt; summon lvl 2 normal dragon</li>
</ul>
Note fossil dig can be an extender to make your combo less fragile to handtraps since it searches carboneddon and since Cynet / plant stuff discard him

Since this deck is full of 1 card FTKS you can run so many anti handtraps its funny XD
<ul>
 	<li><strong>3 Called by the grave</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>3 Crossout Designator</strong> (free activation for panda, you need to main lots of Popular handtraps for this)</li>
 	<li><strong>3 Dragged down into the grave</strong> (An upstart to draw into your ftk cards + removes handtraps LUL), it basically never matters what they discard</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Extenders (Fossil dig and carboneddon already mentioned)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Unexpected dai. Well it puts a vannila on the field ...</li>
 	<li>Shaddoll fusion sending carboneddon to the graveyard</li>
 	<li>Foolish burial &gt; it puts a vannila on the field by putting carboneddon in grave or draws with shadd beast</li>
 	<li>Instant fusion + lvl 1 vannila or unexpected dai is an ftk</li>
</ul>
<strong>Draw cards</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>In case you don't draw one of your 18 1 card FTKS</li>
 	<li>3x Magical mallet - <strong>NO THIS IS NOT A BAD CARD </strong></li>
 	<li>Already mentioned 3X dragged down</li>
 	<li>Shaddoll fusion sending the only target shaddoll beast for draw 1</li>
</ul>
So yeah its really not a 60 card deck with this much draw power, the deck only has few bricks but you would still rather go to 60.

&nbsp;

Handtraps in general (since this deck is full of 1 card engines it can play many) and for Crossout. Crossout has to send from the deck
<ul>
 	<li>2x Maxx C (this is the most popular handtrap in the ocg)</li>
 	<li>2x Ash (the card is limited but stillalso stops maxx C so why not)</li>
 	<li>1x Droll</li>
 	<li>1x veiler (also stops maxx C)</li>
 	<li>2x Impermanence (Crossout negates traps to, Imp aint once per turn)</li>
 	<li>1x Belle</li>
 	<li>1x Ghost ogre</li>
</ul>
There is also 1 pankratops as second oviraptor search target and being decent in general

(If any other handtrap you think is popular like d.d crow except for Phantazmei as he doesn't stop you add it)

<strong>Combo pieces</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Lvl 1 Vannila dragon tuner (Flamvell guard)</li>
 	<li>Lvl 2 vannila dragon tuner (Lustia the guardragon)</li>
</ul>
You need both as different 1 card ftks require diff ones
<ul>
 	<li>2X Carboneddon (Because you don't mind drawing it + you like having him in deck at all times)</li>
 	<li>1x Fairy dragon Larvalaur searches the gandora</li>
 	<li>1x gandora x (It with Equimax at 8k is an FTK &gt; Equimax points to Saryuja and Archfiend Abyss)</li>
 	<li>Predaplant darling cobra</li>
 	<li>World chalice guardragon &gt; IB summons from deck / grave so if you draw him discard him.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Extra deck is all just combo pieces. Everything is needed sort off. Lambda is there because you gotta link of shekk. Raidjin is just good in case you had the extenders. in case fiber gets handtraped why not draw with formula.

Side deck should be more handtraps and mystic mine hate.

<div class=""card-name"">Ancient Gear Fortress to protect Ancient Gear Wyvern, Frame and Hunting Hound. you're going to use frame, link slayer, Trade-In and Hand Destruction to send monsters to the grave to mill the deck for Overload Fusion or get to Ancient Gear Fusion. i run Called by the Grave and Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring just for <b><b>defense </b></b>against gnomaterial and Ash Blossom or effect veiler. Ancient Gear Castle is more for the counters on this card so you can Tribute this card. i use Scapegoats During my opponent's turn then if i can go out to Borreload Dragon.  in the extra deck category you have Ancient Gear Howitzer, Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem and Ancient Gear Megaton Golem let's say you got Overload Fusion and not enough materials in grave go out to Ancient Gear Howitzer it needs 2 ""Ancient Gear"" monsters  and Unaffected by other cards' effects. During your Main Phase: You can inflict 1000 damage to your opponent. You can only use this effect of ""Ancient Gear Howitzer"" once per turn. Your opponent is going to need to get rid of it and when its destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard: You can Special Summon 1 ""Ancient Gear"" monster from your Deck, ignoring its Summoning conditions.  Next is Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem ""Ancient Gear Golem"" + 2 ""Ancient Gear"" monsters it's not great but If this card is destroyed, you can Special Summon 1 ""Ancient Gear Golem"" from your Graveyard, ignoring the Summoning conditions. Next is Ancient Gear Megaton Golem its generic it needs 3 ""Ancient Gear"" monsters f this card was Fusion Summoned using 2 or more ""Ancient Gear Golem"" and/or ""Ancient Gear Golem - Ultimate Pound"" as material, it can attack up to that many times during each Battle Phase. If this face-up Fusion Summoned card in its owner's control leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect: You can Special Summon 1 ""Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem"" from your Extra Deck, ignoring its Summoning conditions.

Your opponent's monsters cannot activate their effects during the Battle Phase. This card can attack all monsters your opponent controls, once each.

Once you have this field, you just build off of it.  Maybe fusion summon your dragon destroyer swordsman, or  use red resonator to give you some extra life points while summoning a powerful dragon archfiend, or use yours and/or your opponents monster to super poly into a five headed dragon.  But that's just extra spice. The deck is built around getting that ideal field in which I explained in the first paragraph as quickly as possible--the rest comes later."

I think the ability to pop a spell card using <a data-name=""Dragonic Diagram"">Dragonic Diagram</a> and then being able to use <a data-name=""Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!"">Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!</a> to heavily search and draw is a brilliant idea. The deck did pretty well in testing. Your beginning turn should look like, using your Sky Striker cards and attempting to gain massive card advantage in hand, bringing out <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku"">Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku</a>, and then tribute summoning your True Draco continuous spell and trap cards using your True Draco cards, like <a data-name=""True Draco Heritage"">True Draco Heritage</a> to summon a True Draco monster, or a couple if you have the other True Draco continuous spell card, <a data-name=""True Draco Disciples"">True Draco Disciples</a>. You want to go first, although it can go second without any problems, as long as you're not facing any variant of Thunder Dragons. <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> definitely shuts down this deck very fast, which is why a big chunk of the side deck is dedicated to the Thunder Dragon match up. Another couple of hard match ups are Orcust and Cyber Dragons, which is why I came up with the idea to side <a data-name=""System Down"">System Down</a>, also ABC is still a thing as well. System Down really eliminates Orcust if it resolves since their entire engine is Machine type. You have to bait their Orcust counter trap first and then use it and there's nothing they can do to stop it. So using something like Engage first which they will want to negate, and then once they do, use System Down and they will immediately realize the game is over haha. Once again, I think <a data-name=""Book of Moon"">Book of Moon</a> is a seriously underrated card, it has won me many games because of being able to force your opponent to negate it if your going second and they have negates on board is great. You can activate Book of Moon to target their card that can negate, for example <a data-name=""Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon</a> and they will have to negate it with that monster or a different monster otherwise they won't be able to use its negate effect since it becomes face-down and unknown. Not only that, but going first if you shut down their normal summon to make their monster unknown, it can really hurt them depending on the match up. Like against Salamangreat being able to Book of Moon their normal summon really hurts them because then they can't link off or activate <a data-name=""Salamangreat Spinny"">Salamangreat Spinny</a> in grave since they don't control a Salamangreat monster and will most likely have to pass their turn. Also, I know being able to OTK with True Draco and Sky Striker in general is a problem, which is why I added <a data-name=""Hiita The Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita The Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a> because she can special summon an opponent's fire monster from their graveyard, and then you can go into <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> or <a data-name=""Ningirsu The World Chalice Warrior"">Ningirsu The World Chalice Warrior</a> and clear their board for an OTK. You can also summon another monster and go into <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, which 90% of the time finishes the game, or they scoop before hand haha. Anyways, I hope you guys have a fun time playing the deck, and of course, stick around for more!"

&#x1f534; Deck strategy (How does the deck work)

Deck focused on sent to the GY our Phantom Knight Monsters to search the Phantom Knight Trap cards. The main card of the deck is The Phantom Knight of Rusty Bardiche because it allows us to sent Phantom Knights to the GY and set Phantom Knight cards to the field directly from the Deck. The most important Trap cards of the Deck let us summon Phantom Knights from the GY so they have different uses that give to the Deck more versatility and Recovery.

In the Side Deck, you will find budget options to replace the most expensive cards of the Deck and other cards to improve this version."

No Balerdroch because I don't really like that card personally. This deck is extra deck-based heavily focus on summoning Shiranui synchro monsters. This deck is better to go second, with Squiresaga's effect, she can banish herself to destroy two cards on the field, or gain various advantages if you banish other Shiranui from GY. Zombie World can at least slow down type-based decks and can be useful to summon the guardian of this deck, Skillsaga Supremacy. It is also possible to bring out Sunsaga during your opponrnt's turn by using Riser Dragon (summonned using Needlefiber) and Squiresaga on the field.

To start a play you can use Ghost Meets Girl, Solitiarie, Spiritmaster, or Squire, I don't feel like running 3 copies of Uni-Zombie so I focus more on the Shiranui cards instead. At least you can get rid some of your opponent's cards with them, and still have a chance to attack."

its hard to fusion buster since no kaiju are dragon type. to deal with this, you can have neos fusion first to discard rainbow dragon, or use prologue to discard destruction sword fusion and buster blade, and pray so the opponent use dragon type and you have buster blader in hand, so next turn, you can take back yur fusion by discarding a hand, and then fusion using enemy monster."

Turn 2 you need to keep your extra deck open for shiranui synchro and link plays. Main issue to worry about is NOT TO RESUMMON DAKKI if you need to make a mayakashi synchro to get rid of HAJUN or YUKI-MUSUME. You have 3 options to go with on turn 2 reset the mayakashi float monsters by resummoning gashadokuro with mezuki or board clearing with Yoko/tengu, unicorn, squire saga, and spirit master or otk by clearing monsters or backrow to ensure the otk with Yoko/tengu and squiresaga and making borrelsword.

","Thank God for Dark Neostorm. Burning Abyss is back with some Orcust friends for those saucy negates/disruptions. Now I know this list also runs Sekka's Light, but after reading my reasoning below, hopefully you'll understand.

Phantom Knight's and Orcust Trap cards banish themselves from the GY. Meaning, you can use Sekka's Light AFTER you have pulled off the ridiculous 2 card combos.

If you want some more fun combos, leave a comment on this list and I'll post what I know.

<ul>
 	<li>Fiendish Rhino Warrior + Any BA = Beatrice, Rusty Bardiche, Galatea, 3 Negates.</li>

&#x1f534; Deck strategy (How does the deck work)

Deck Aggro focused on summon our Super Quantum quickly with their own effects and thanks to the Brilliant Fusion and Predaplant engine to have access to an Extra Normal Summon to extend our plays. Use the GY it's crucial because every Super Quantum pilot we play have an extra effect when they are sent to the GY, so we should play around the Super Quantum we sent to the GY and the monsters we currently have in our field. With the new Super Quantal Link the problem of waste a lot of resources to summon our Super Quantal Beast with the field spell is fixed thanks to the power draw we gain with the effect of our new Link."

Bond between teacher and student is one of the best cards available for dark magician. The main strategies of the deck are the basic control and interruption plays that dark magician are known for, but with added spice. With your Dark Magic Circle, Eternal Soul and Magicians Navigation allowing you negations and banishment to your opponent the deck is a underrated rouge strategy. Ash Blossom and Infinite Impermanence are needed in the deck for added protection because the deck is vulnerable to hand traps itself.

Bond Between Teacher And Student is effectively a reverse sages stone, allowing you to summon Dark Magician Girl from anywhere, then allowing you a deck search to set your powerful advantage cards. Dark Burning Magic is without a doubt the best card to search for, Dark Magic Twin Burst is not as good but I feel is a good one of tech card that you can if you wanted to switch out for other cards, but it does have its uses. The Spellbook draw engine is used perfectly with this deck, instantly making your Dark Magic inheritance live as well as being brilliant draw power for any spellcaster deck.

In my side deck are multiple cards i feel have their uses, Mahad is perfect if you are going against a DARK attribute deck. other cards like secret village and epidemic virus can shut down your opponent before they get a chance to combat against your board."

This is my first Deck ever made on ygopro , so feel free to add any card that would make it more powerful in your opinion. Here are a few shenanigans you can do with the Deck to annoy your opponent.
1. Kaiju a monster of the opponent and then steal it with Natasha
2. Nuke the entire board with Black Rose, but protect your monster by banishing the ritual card
3. Building up your graveyard via Michaels mill for Natasha, and then link climb with her by special summoning her from the grave and snatching monsters from the enemy.

Those are just a few strategies that you can do with the deck. And it's finally a good ritual deck without abusing the impcantation cards

Edit: This is an updated version of the deck, thanks to the reader who told me that hex sealed fusion cant special summon Construct, me is dumb sury xD"

Deck Aggro focused on send to the GY our Burning Abyss Monsters to be able to summon our main Extra Deck Monsters: Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss, Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss; and The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche, which would let us gain resources sending more cards to the GY. Send cards to the GY is the main way the Deck has to gain resources and make plays but also has Beatrice, Lady of Eternal that will be very helpful to control the opponent."

(Deck Inspiration: None)

Main Goal:
Draw all Exodia pieces.

How to Accomplish:

Use Into the Void until you win.

The only way you'll possibly lose is by being Ash Blossom'd or Droll and Lock Bird, or possibly going second with negates. Only works if ""Don't Check Deck"" is activated. It abuses the bug I have discovered that can duplicate cards that I would like to call ""The Disaster Bug"".

Reflector is a 1 card combo, so it doesn't really brick you. If it gets negated, you can still go into Savage dragon later in the combo (It's dark so Orcusts don't stop it from coming out). It makes for amazing Ash Bait.

Side deck hasn't been tested very well, so add what you want.

Try this deck out if you're looking for an out-of-the-box Control deck.

Deck Beatdown focused on the Destiny HERO swarming to make a strong offensive to reduce the life point of the opponent the quickest possible. For this task, Fusion Destiny will be crucial because it will allow us to send Destiny HERO monsters to the GY to revive them with Xtra HERO Crusader.

Now let's highlight ideas that been followed through during this deck building-
<ol>
 	<li>Stall for as long as you can until you get the right card/cards. to help you stalling I added <strong>Spell-mining Cave</strong>. Using this card is quit effective against the deck that mostly relies on monster effect- like <strong>Knightmare Phonix </strong>etc. As well as prevents your opponents from attacking you as long as you have less monster than them. mean while you can prepare to assemble desired cards to spring out syncro/ xyz monsters. <strong>But never use Spell-mining Cave on your 1st turn while going first, you'll just lose this card. </strong>Though Umi deck users or who have cards like harpies fether duster may easily get rid on this card.</li>
 	<li>your Second protection is <b>Dark sanctuary, </b>though it may not full proof protection like Spell-Mining Cave but atlist gives you a chance to inflict damage on opponent if you flip head. It is advised to use Second Coin Toss with it to have better chance flipping Head.</li>
 	<li> Use Spell Reproduction to get back <strong>Cup of Ace </strong>from GY. so you can keep drawing cards.</li>

Now let's highlight ideas that been followed through during this deck building-
<ol>
 	<li>Stall for as long as you can until you get the right card/cards. to help you stalling I added <strong>Spell-mining Cave</strong>. Using this card is quit effective against the deck that mostly relies on monster effect- like <strong>Knightmare Phonix </strong>etc. As well as prevents your opponents from attacking you as long as you have less monster than them. mean while you can prepare to assemble desired cards to spring out syncro/ xyz monsters. <strong>But never use Spell-mining Cave on your 1st turn while going first, you'll just lose this card. </strong>Though Umi deck users or who have cards like harpies fether duster may easily get rid on this card.</li>
 	<li>your Second protection is <b>Dark sanctuary, </b>though it may not full proof protection like Spell-Mining Cave but atlist gives you a chance to inflict damage on opponent if you flip head. It is advised to use Second Coin Toss with it to have better chance flipping Head.</li>
 	<li> Use Spell Reproduction to get back <strong>Cup of Ace </strong>from GY. so you can keep drawing cards.</li>

Bishbaalkin summons many tokens as many tokens as the least available space from either side with same number of tokens on both sides. After tokens are summoned, Chaos MAX can go for 8000 damage OR Chaos dragon plus Bishbaalkin, Chaos Dragon attacks to switch tokens to attack, then Bishbaalkin destroys the opponent with its attack power.
