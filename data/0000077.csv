Provided you have the Golden Lord out on the field, the Eldlixer quick-play spell and trap become quick-effect reborns for your Mayakashi synchros to provide additional disruption and recover from positions of disadvantage remarkably easy. Eldlixer of Black Awakening can also serve as an additional method of getting out Hajun, allowing you to access your synchro ladder turn 3 relatively easily if you failed to do so on turn 1. Dakki/Yuki-Musume provide recurring tribute fodder for the Everglorious Golden Land, and the deck is capable of easily getting out the Mayakashi synchros using either Hajun or Dakki + the Golden Land trap-monsters (who are level 5, excluding Guardian). Mayakashi Winter also serves as both a nice consistency booster with its draw effect and as good fodder for the Golden Lord's revival effect. Eldlich and Mayakashi complement each other extremely well, as Eldlich allows you to easily control the state of the game while the Mayakashi synchros enable you to output massive damage when presented with openings, compared to pure Eldlich's normally mediocre damage output.  &nbsp;  For the side deck, most choices are cards that aid in going second as this deck is overall weak to disruption early on and struggles to start up against established boards. I have additionally included a package of Generaider cards as they are a solid addition to the deck if you choose to play them (though they are main deck material). If you do decide to run the Generaider ""engine"", the ratios of Golden Land and Eldlixer cards should be adjusted slightly to provide room (cut Conquistador down to 2, Guardian down to 1, and Eldlixer of White Fate down to 2/1, by preference. Other cards to consider cutting for room are Ash Blossom, Dakki to 1, Yuki-Musume to 2/1, or Mayakashi Winter to 1). While Hela does provide good additional quick-effect revival, she is by no means essential to the deck and can often be somewhat clunky and unnecessary as the Eldlixer cards generally have the same utility while being far more consistent, thus I would suggest that you try out the Generaider cards and see if you like them before fully committing to the idea."

With this deck, use the power of the 3 Egyptian God cards to there fullest. This deck is a combination of all my favorite original cards. Use clever traps like Gravekeeper's servant to stop your opponent from attacking, then, activate the abilities of mystic tomato or sangan to build up your dark card army, summoning enough cards to summon an Egyptian god! If you can't seem to get enough cards to summon a god, you can use Different Dimension capsule, or Gold Sarcophagus to get the cards you need, or use possessed dark soul's effect to steal your opponents monsters and use them to summon a god yourself! Meanwhile, you can use cards like Poison of the Old Man, Spirit of the Breeze, or Skull-mark Ladybug to gain more LP, either feeding that into Ra's attack power, or using it to outlast your opponent!"

The reason I put them together with kaiju's is because of the broken card called ""Interrupted Kaiju Slumber"" which if you don't already know blows-up all monsters on the field to special summon 1 kaiju to each players field which triggers the unchains effects while also getting rid of your opponents monsters, kaiju's also give you an out to monsters that can't be targeted because Konami made unchained have to target to link summon for some reason."

When you have at least 4 Lightsworns in the graveyard you can bring out one of the boss monsters called <a data-name=""Judgment Dragon"">Judgment Dragon</a>. I put in <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> in case the opponent has set the field for them to just annihilate everything plus as an added bonus if you have any shaddolls on the field they were just sent to the graveyard by a card effect so their effects still work. <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a> is in case you can't get out the nukes and if your opponent has a card in their spell/trap zones that is getting bothersome. I put in <a data-name=""Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend"">Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend</a> for the same reasons as Judgment Dragon and Black Rose Dragon, BUT I prefer using this card because for each special summoned monster destroyed inflict 500 damage to your opponent plus this card still gets to attack and there are no drawbacks. <a data-name=""Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn"">Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn</a> is in this deck because; 1. He is a Lightsworn so why not put him in this deck. 2. Just by paying 1000 life points you can banish a card on the field, so use this ability to remove a card on the opponent's field that has been bothering you. <a data-name=""Decode talker"">Decode Talker</a> is in this deck because each time I use this deck I realize that this deck makes bringing out monster onto the field way to easy so he is in to make space on the field. I have <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">El Shaddoll Construct</a> in this deck mainly because she is a must-have for any shaddoll deck and a great card that can destroy any special summoned monster. <a data-name=""Shaddoll Construct"">Shaddoll Construct</a> is in this deck because I realized people don't even use her even though she just came out and because she can just keep on reviving herself as long as you have any shaddoll cards to spare. <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">El Shaddoll Apkallone</a> is in this deck because she just can't die from a fight and can negate a card effect when Special Summoned plus gives me a shaddoll card to discard when she is destroyed. <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Shekhinaga"">El Shaddoll Shekhinaga</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Wendigo"">El Shaddoll Wendigo</a>, and <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> are really just fillers. The Combos I use Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend/Black Rose Dragon/Judgment Dragon + Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn + El Shaddoll Construct/El Shaddoll Apkallone, this combo helps remove the field of anything unwanted or can build up a serious burn on your opponent and to set up your own field. Another Combo I use is Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend + Any Shaddoll Fusion monster +<a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation""> Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a> I put in my Side Deck @Ignister card for those annoying cyberse decks like ""Salmanagreat"" and <a data-name=""Black Luster Soldier Envoy of the Beginning"">Black Luster Soldier Envoy of the Beginning </a>is in there for continuous attack. <a data-name=""Red Blossoms from Underroot"">Red Blossoms from Underroot</a> is in there to bring out lost allies. I maybe posting a version 2 of this deck to show the cards I am going to add."

From the first time i played orcust, i've fell in love with it. Orcust deck is all about summoning Dingirsu in opponents turn and send their field to the GY, very simple. Thats why this is a going first deck.  The basic combo is: firstly, u summon Armageddon knight/Dark grepher/scap recycler or mekk-knight girsu and send knightmare to the GY; ban knightmare, send world wand to the GY and  ban world wand to summon back knightmare; link out galatea and set Babel; eventually, u get dingirsu easily. And u can use danger or other ways to summon another mons and link out I:P. In the next turn, u can ban knightmare, send skeleton to the GY and bring dingirsu back to send 1 card to the GY.  The full combo require: Scrap recycler, a Danger mons. Firstly, u summon recycler, send knightmare to GY; link out wyvern. ss recycler and destroy recycler; then, wyvern gonna trigger its effect to ss golem from the deck and destroy wyvern; use golem to ss recycler and send skeleton to GY. After that, do the same as combo 1 but before u ss dingirsu, ban skeleton and ss knightmare; then when u ss dingirsu it will attach ske as material. Finally, u link out I:P, still have 1 more mons on the field and your GY will have both ske and dingirsu.  If u successfully block your opponent deck, u can link out cards like zeroboros,borreload or borrelsword to end the game  So...as you can see, Orcust is a good deck with many cards to block your opponents field  Thank you for reading my work  &nbsp;"

Well, this deck has many strategies to play with but i think this is the most effective one. This is a two cards combo of Uni-Zombie and Necroworld Banshee. Firstly, u gonna summon Uni and discard Necroworld to get the Zombie World (but u can do this by using the Danger!s). Then, you send Glow-up to the GY by Uni's effect and Glow-Up gonna trigger its effect and ss Doomking. After that u can link out I:P or Vampire Sucker. Finally, in the next stanby phase Doomking will come back and we'll have 1 negate and 1 ban.  To be clear, this is just the basic combo that u can play. So do you best to improve it!

I always liked the theme behind Cyber Dragons as much as the Character who owned them, Zane Truesdale.  For many years the deck was ALL-OUT BEATDOWN with cards like Power Bond, Overload Fusion, and with monsters like Cyber Twin Dragon and Chimeratech Overdragon.  Later on, with the release of Cyber Dragon Revolution, it became more XYZ focused but still with the power to perform a great deal of damage. Cyber Dragon Nova helped a lot with this.  Now in the modern days, Cyber Dragon Infinity is a thing, and with so many Machine Duplication targets (Core,Nachster,Herz), the deck has became more combo-oriented, and Power Bond sees less and less play over time.  For this deck I tried to bring back the whole Power Bond theme but keep Cyber Dragons Combo-Oriented still.  The the deck is really consistent with the waves of support it got over the years, and can play through disruptions like Ash, Droll &amp; Lock or Veiler easily (most of the times)  This is my Deck List.  Note 1: Cyberload Fusion is one of the greatest finishers the deck has since it can bring out Cyber Twin Dragon after the attacks of all monsters, and attack twice for least damage through direct attack 5600 and if Sieger is on the field it intensifies.  Note 2: I found Cybernetic Overflow to be one exeptionally good card in terms of removal and searching since it can give you an edge in card advantage. (Notable Example: Opponent with 4 monsters goes into Phoenix and targets Cybernetic Overflow, Activated it --&gt; Broke his board --&gt; Got a free Search  Opponent is -3 while you maintain advantage). That's The Reason I ran 2.  If you want to see the deck in action, you can watch my newly uploaded video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6GgA-6oubs&amp;t=7s"

This deck is focusing on the Goyos to beat your opponent down or have a legit 1st turn board thanks to Goyo Emperor which fits both category. We're using Deep Sea and Atlantean engine as it can snipe handtrap while peeking at opponent's hand going first, giving us great advantage while proceeding with one card combo. Another good one card starter is Righty+Lefty Driver as we need those to make Goyo Defender which is our heart and soul of this deck. I will explain the Goyo combo going 1st or going 2nd to OTK.  Going first, we need our starter like Diva or Righty, Diva is searchable through Deep Sea Minstrel+Atlantean Dragoons and we can snipe handtrap in the process. Normal summon Diva/Righty, use their eff ss Neptabyss/Lefty (dont use Lefty eff), if we go for Neptabyss route we can send Dragoons, add Dragoons, and add Minstrel to snipe. Then we ss Goyo Defender (using Righty+Lefty or Diva+Neptabyss), use Defender ss another one, repeat, and link off two of them for Isolde, use Isolde add God Phoenix Gearfried, use Isolde send Living Fossil ss Renaud, use Renaud add Living Fossil, use Living Fossil ss tuner from GY, link off Renaud+tuner for Halqifibrax, use Halqifibrax ss tuner from deck (count the level so we can make Martial Metal Marcher later with Linkross token(s)), link off Isolde for Linkross, use Linkross ss token(s), tune the tuner+token(s) for Martial, use Martial ss tuner from GY, link off Martial+tuner for Masquerena, link off Halqifibrax+Linkross for Verte Anaconda, use Verte send Miracle Synchro Fusion for Goyo Emperor using material from GY. Next main phase we can link off Masquerena+Verte for any generic link 4.  Going second, we need to ss lv2 tuner (like Diva) from Halqifibrax and 2 tokens from Linkross, then tune Diva+token for Martial, use Martial ss Diva, tune Diva+token for Mist Bird Clausolas, use Clausolas to negate effect and change 1 opponent's monster atk to 0, from there you can go for Goyo Predator, Emperor, or any link play you want.  <img src=""https://ms.yugipedia.com//thumb/c/c2/SectorSecurity-DULI.png/257px-SectorSecurity-DULI.png"" alt=""image"" />  Expected first turn:  <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/PSGJCww.png"" alt=""image"" />  (can even extend for Mermail Abyssmegalo + its equip too)  Pros: Consistent and strong going first or second, bunch of handtrap and can snipe one of your opponent's, have follow up play thank to God Phoenix Gearfried or link/synchro play.  Cons: First turn board is not strong enough, Goyo Emperor returns the monster stolen if it leaves the field, possible bricking because running bunch of handtraps (not too bad)."

Considered tapping into the power of these purple phenomena? ,"One of, by far, the oldest broken cards to be printed - goes by the name of Cyber-Stein. Not only was it banned for a consecutive <em>sixteen </em>formats; it is one of the most overpowered (not to mention rare) cards in the game. However, with great power comes a whole lot of lifepoints. By paying over 5000 lifepoints: you are granted the summon of any fusion monster in the game. But with I told you there is a way to play the card without paying the price? Come with me - and I'll show you the magic of 2 minute turns!!  So how do you pull this off? Well its actually rather simple. Reprodocus is a link 2 that can change the typing of any card. Boom! Easy as that. All you need to do make Reprodocus, somehow summon Cyber-Stein under a zone the card points to and change it to psychic. <em>Well</em>.....you also need to equip it with a specific spell that can only be searched off of a certain card which can be summoned using a specific monster that you can make usi...okay. Maybe it isn't as simple as it sounds but let me elaborate. To start the combo: you can make Isolde. This is easily achievable using monsters like Junk Forward, The Neo-Spacian package, or your HERO monsters. Once you've made her - you can start to put together the pieces of your combo. By pitching Telekinetic Charging Cell - you are allowed to summon Renaud. Thanks to his effect: you add BACK the equip spell card and kablamo! That's one part done.  Step 2: make Saryuja. This is by far the hardest step, but you have to remember that you don't always need four monsters. Let me go into more detail: we mainly use Saryuja as a means of summoning rescue ferret. While the draw 4 is nice- you only necessarily want the summon ability. Here's the other roadblock I mentioned: Rescue Ferret. Since you are summoning from hand, the combo relies on you already having the adorable emancipator. But what if you don't manage to open him? Well, no need to worry, 90% of your spells are there to reset your hand. One one side you have cards like Reload and Magical Mallet that completely warp your hand to how you want it. And on the other you have generic draw power like the bamboo engine. I can see you shaking your hand thinking '47 card upstart, he's living life on the edge!'. While I am indeed a daring ladies man - the reason you play it is in order to have that lifepoint difference. If your opponent has higher lifepoints than you - you can activate Emerging Emergency Rescute Rescue..try saying that five times.  Okay - so you've got the ferret, but what now? Well you use its effect in order to summon from the deck: 'Steam the Cloak', 'Junk Anchor' and 'Dotscaper'. From there; you can synchro summon Herald of the Arc Light and get a free token off of Steam, as well as Dotscaper returning to the field thanks to its effect. Now that you have enough monsters - Junk Anchor replaces Road Synchron and Cha-Ching! Road Warrior is on the field. Using his effect you can summon Cyber-Stein, link Saryuja and Warrior into Reprodocus - change Stein's typing to psychic and <em>mic-dropped</em> you have the god board......What's that? Nibiru? Uh...game 2?  So that's the combo. You can use Millennium-Eyes and the two Ojamas + Repro to make Apollousa. Then summon two Cyber Twin Dragons to make Dingirsu - summon Exterio, Dragun and finally Last Warrior. Congratulations your opponent cannot activate spells, traps, or monster effects and cannot summon at all. Of course you can just make the two Ojama monsters and Exterio to get the same outcome but that's not as fun.  Overall: this deck is a spicy 8.2/10. With the ability to summon any fusion monster in the game you really can mess around with this. The downside is obviously the fact this is a turbo deck: so if, by any chance, you brick - well its best to just scoop. Stein is a fun card &amp; and Renaud adding the equip spell from grave makes this ever so easier to accomplish. I'd definitely give this deck a try - seeing as though it completely stops your opponent from playing. What an engaging deck am I right?"

Here ya go!,"Try to get at least 1 Ojama blue on your side on the field and you are ready to go. (By using Ojamatch or Rescue cat or just normal summon)  Attack one of your opponent's monsters and use its destruction eff to search Ojamatch and magic(as long as there are enough of your 3 Ojamas in your Deck) to your hand then you activate Match to add blue and normal summon it to attack again but this time you can add 1 Ojamissilation.  Repeat this step but then with adding red to hand so that you can normal summon red to summon all of your ojamas in your hand ;)  (magics eff triggers and you get Ojama black, green and yellow. These are necessary if you try to activate Ojamissilation.)  Link them away to a link monster of your choice (I personally would choose Apoullousa, Saryjuya (highly recommended), Borrelsword or Abomination )  then activate Ojamissilation to summon A, B, and C by banishing 3 Ojamas from the grave (don't forget to use Ojamissilations eff to draw 1 afterward)  link them away for cross sheep and another link 2 and then summon ABC buster.(Crosshep can special one rank 4 or lower )  and if you are lucky and can summon swamp boi you can summon A to Z.  I hope you guys like it and maybe help improving it.  Long live the Ojama!!!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

You may have won your games by making unfair boards, but this time, you'll have to break boards.  &nbsp;  The deck you see before you is a Shaddoll Dinosaurs deck, using a combination of Jewel Beast - Argosaurus, Babycerasaurus, and Petiteranodon for much-needed consistency. I call it ""Hello Zepp"", inspired by the theme song you people have given me and my legacy. You call my story ""SAW"".

Prank-Kids is a really adorable archetype that focuses on link and fusion summoning and then using their graveyard effects to spam the board with even more kids and then proceeding to play on your opponent's turn, much like kids in real life, it's really annoying for everyone else involved.  All Kids monsters have an effect that lets you special summon another one with a different name if they're used as lionk or fusion material for extra deck Prank-Kids monsters, building a board can be an extremely easy task... if you happen to open well. As good as this archetype is it can brick harder than a Polish construction worker, leaving you to scoop and run off to cry in a corner. Prank kids have no 1 card combos, you need to open with at least 1 and either an Instant Fusion or Pranks, ideally you open 2 monsters and 1 Poly but that doesn't happen as often as you'd like. As long as you have 2 Kids on the field you can pop off pretty hard, Place searches you an additional monster as well as increases your monsters' attack and decreases the opponents', Pranks can help you link climb with only 1 monster as well as recycle materials at end step, Plan saves you from being OTK'd and can Link summon a monster on your opponents' turn and Pandemonium is a searchable quick play fusion although you most often want to activate that during the opponent's turn as it locks you into Prank Kid monsters if used on your turn.  The kids all have individual effects which are all quite good too, Fansies pitches a card from the deck to grave, in most cases you'll want to send Plan, Dropsies heals you for 500, Lampsies burns the opponent for 500 and Rocksies requires you to banish a card and you then get to draw another one. Rocksies' effect is easily the worst as more often than not you'll have to banish a combo piece and have a chance of either drawing something better or some absolute garbage.  The most basic of Turn 1 combos is making a Dodo, activating the effects of Kids in grave and making sure your Dodo's effect is chain link 1 so that it can't be Ashed and finally ending on a Bark and Washer with a Pandemonium set for next turn, where you can proceed to make even more plays, such as making Butler and blowing up your opponent's monsters. To help witch consistency we're playing 2 Fusion recycling plants that can further help us in getting a Poly in hand, as well as as 2 Instant Fusions and a Reasoning to help us get some bodies on board, finally 2 draw spells of Upstart and Void, the latter is a pretty safe card to sue as you'll rarely end with cards in hand. A good argument could be made for playing Desires, and while it is much better than the draw cards we're playing now, in practice it banishes important combo pieces much more often than you'd think, though feel free to replace those spells with Desires' if you personally think it works better.  The deck's most dreaded counter is Big Boy Nibiru which can stop us dead in our tracks, which is why we're playing 3 Koa'Ki Meru Guardians which can negate a monster effect once per turn, Prank Kids can afford to play without using their normal summon, which makes guardian a very good tech in the deck, after all , the best way to counter a rock is with an even bigger rock. Ash and Droll can also hurt us quite a bit, which is why we're playing Called by in main.  Finally, the extra deck is the real powerhouse, prepare to burn through almost all your copies of Prank Kids monsters that you can recycle with effects of Dodo, Bark and Pranks, so it never really runs out of steam. For extra power we're playing the OTK machine known as Borrelsword, a Borreload for some monster snatching, a Dweller and Toad for more versatility plus more disruption and a single Apollousa that we almost never go into so feel free to replace it with something else if you're playing on a budget.  Finally in the side deck we're playing some strong going second cards in the likely event we win game 1. Thanks to Master Rules coming into effect fairly soon Prank-Kids will receive a much needed boost, as well as an ability to spit a Toad out before the 5th summon, so Nibiru will be even easier to dodge as well as not needing to think of link marker position in regards to fusion summoning will help with ending on a Washer and Toad or Abyss much easier.  Prank-Kids can be an extremely fun and rewarding as well as a competitive deck in the right hands, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're willing to sacrifice hours of your life memorizing combos, or thinking up completely new ones in the middle of a duel, just like in real life it takes a lot of patience and dedication in order to guide a Kid to maximize their true potential."

Do you want to win games with as little interaction with your opponents as possible? Do you want an easy win game button? Do hate yourself? If you answered yes to any of the questions above, go see a doctor. Then come back to this guide and start playing Mystic Mine Burn, a perfectly fair and well balanced card that was begging to have a whole deck made around it to piss people off to new heights previously thought to be impossible.  Oh, your opponent has a board with 8 negations on board? OK, cool you just drop that Dark Ruler/Lava Golem on them and proceed with setting up your own board. Blinding second is the name of the game here, you let your opponent do everything they want and all you gotta do is make sure Mine stays on field until Cauldron of the Old man can finish them off. You're essentially playing 11 copies of Mine as 8 of those cards help you search it, so getting it onto the field is easy as piss. Your win condition is Cauldron, a card that gets a counter for each Standby Phase it stays on your field and burns the opponent for 300 LP for each counter OR you could use it to heal yourself instead (although be aware that the latter strategy works best in competitive games when you're under a time limit).  Silent Wobby is in the main deck for 2 reasons, in case your opponent makes you go firs or if he tries to be a smart ass about it and summon no monsters on his first turn you just activate Mine, give him the Wobby and back to business as usual, have fun with a useless fish that's clogging up your board. Prohibition can be used turn 1 to make sure that no spell removal is played, great targets include Lightning Storm, Twin Twisters and most importantly Cosmic Cyclone as Field Barrier can't protect your Mine from being banished. Field Barrier also prevents Mine from being destroyed by it's own effect, and locks your opponent out of using a field spell of their own. and Skuld insures that your opponent will never reach his spell removal. Chain Energy is a piece of light spice that will burn your opponent even further for just trying to out mine but can be replaced with anything else you might fancy.  Extra deck exists mainly as Extravagance dump, though if you find yourself with tokens on your field you an always go into Linkuriboh or Link spider to link into Barricadeborg to try and minimize the risk of having the same or more monsters than your opponent, and if Mine does die you can discard a card in hopes of getting it back. Fusionist and Emperor can be replaced with literally anything, i just put them in because they're funny. Finally the side deck consists of some negates and removal which can boost your chances of safely putting Mine on the field, as always tailor it to your own preferences, these are just some helpful recommendations.  Final thoughts... well it's slow and degenerate, 2 of my favorite things which actually provides me with a lot of fun whenever I'm playing the deck. I enjoy having to think as little as possible when playing Yugioh now and again whilst getting some tainted victories along the way, so Mystic Mine burn was right up my alley. Now i just hope Konami doesn't ban it, because that really would make me go ""Awwww maaaan..."""

They have a game plan, or an idea for one anyway but no real way of applying their effects quickly enough. Cubic counters are actually pretty powerful but the only way to distribute them is for your opponent to attack Vijam however most of the time he'll be taken care of with other removal effects rather than straight up battle which makes that strategy really inconsistent. On the other hand Nova is an extremely powerful boss monster who has a really good summoning condition but Cubics as a deck don't have enough search power to open 3 cubic with different names AND a Nova on a constant basis.  The new support greatly helps the archetype simply by existing because more cards with Cubic in the names means a higher chance to put Nova on the field. Dharma has a really nice effect where it lets you pitch a cubic to draw a card, as well as letting you add one of your monster back upon being destroyed, and it's battle protection can help you ram Vijam into the opponent's monster to spread cubic counters. Ascension and Causality would be perfect as spells but in trap form they're way too slow, also You rarely control more than 1, sometimes 2, Cubic monsters so the counter spreading effect is underwhelming to say the least, you can always send it to grave then normal Vijam, hit your opponent's monster with it then have Nova burn your opponent even harder but that combo requires way too much setup for what it's worth.  Your first priority should be to play a different deck. Second you want to focus on having 3 cubic cards with different names and a Nova in the hand, easier said than done believe you me. Worry not though, if you have around 300 Great British pounds burning a hole in your pocket you could spend that hard earned cash on a playset of Pot of Extravagance, why you'd play them in Cubics of all decks is beyond me however. Jokes aside Extravagance is the best draw card in the game at the moment and you will absolutely need it if you want the deck to perform somewhat OK. We're also playing 3 allure and 2 Dharma because a draw of some kind is absolutely necessary, Summoner Monk is also here due to being able to pitch a Karma or any other spell which in turn would special a Duza on the field, he would pitch a karma and we can then get an upwards of 2 searches, mind you the effects of both these monsters can be negated which is why we're playing Called by in main, only 2 though because I wanted to keep it 40 cards. Twin twisters destroys back row as well as helping with graveyard setup, and the Nibiru and Kaiju cards help with OTK'ing as efficiently as possible.  The deck is meant to go second, if you try to go first the cards will jam, start producing smoke, shit themselves, break down and die. It's an OTK deck that has trouble getting it's main damage dealer on the field, what do you expect? You might be able to end on an Abyss Dweller an nothing else, which is why the side deck is almost filled with going first cards.  Don't get me wrong, I love the simple big number play style and overall Hindu theme of the deck but as I hope i outlined above it has a lot of issues it needs fixing, mainly a better searcher and a more efficient counter spreader, something akin to the Alien Link monster. It's pretty nice that the deck is excelling in Trinity Format somewhat and I hope that Konami eventually cubes up and releases more support that will make the deck much more playable in the traditional format. I just hope Vishnu, the Cubic creator answers my Cubic Prayers sometime soon"

You wouldn't be looking up a Crusadia deck if that wasn't the case. This build focuses on going first and ending on a board with near infinite negates by utilizing the Guardragon engine. The ideal board you want to end on is Spheres, Savage and Gameciel, plus any other negation you can, be it a Dawn Dragster or a set called by the grave. The combo is as follows;  Normal any Crusadia, link into Magius, special Crusadia from anywhere, Magius search Draco (or any other Crusadia monster if you already have a Draco in hand), Link off for Spatha, special Draco, Draco effect to get a Crusadia from grave to hand, Link off for Elpy, Spatha effect, move Elpy 1 zone to the right, special Red-Eyes, Red-Eyes special Draco from grave, make Saryuja, draw 4, put 3 back and depending on your draws find a way of ending on Savage plus another negation and Spheres.  Most people are unawere that Gameciel has an effect that isn't the special summon, you see whenever a card is sent to the grave Kyoutou Waterfront gets a Kaiju Counter on it, remove 3 and you can add Gameciel to hand, simply summon him using Saryuja's effect and bam, you have near infinite negates as Gameciel removes 2 from anywhere on the field to negate a card. Combine that with making a Savage and attaching a Saryuja from grave to him for 4 Negates and when you opponents turn is up you can use spheres to summon Goliath to the field, meaning no extra deck summoning until they get rid of it somehow.  The combo has a bunch of choke points and if you get Nibiru'd or Drolled you're basically screwed. To ensure that the Droll or Ash doesn't go through we're main decking 3 called by and 3 Crusadia Power and  3 Dark Ruler in the event we're forced to go second in game 1, it doesn't matter that we can't do any damage, if we can set up that board and then proceed to clean out the opponent's field we can win without doing any damage as recovering from that will be near impossible. Even then Nibiru is still a nightmare to deal with so just try your best not to get hit with it and you should be fine.  Side deck consists of other going 2nd cards which can help you OTK if you don't want to rely on hard drawing Dark Ruler each and every game, many of those cards and easily;y bait out negates too so there shouldn't be many times where you can't make a big boy Equimax and attack for game, unless you brick or something. You can replace There can be or Evenly with a Nibiru of your own, or any hand trap that you feel would work much better in the side deck, as always these decks aren't 100% optimized, more of a skeleton to go by.  The deck does pretty well against meta decks, mainly thanks to outside engines, and you can build it real cheap, most expensive card here is Savage which is like £25 I think, and can get a good number of those fat juicy W's that make this game worth playing. Overall, I give Paper Mario 2 a 4/5, just a solid RPG."

It should come as no surprise then that Timelords are one of my most favorite decks, with their strategy being summon no more than 1, max 2, monsters onto the field and keep reducing your opponents life points in the slowest way possible, or get rid of their on board that they took 20 minutes to build.  The deck is designed to go second, the deck has almost no first turn plays as most of your monsters gain effects whilst they're attacking, or after battle. Hence why 3 copies of Mystic Mine, a perfectly balanced and skillful card (sarcasm)  has amazing synergy with the deck, as stated above you will rarely have more than 1 monster on the field, so why not go the extra mile and insure your opponents hate you with a burning passion?  Strategy is very simple, first priority is to get Michion on field, halve your opponent's life points and stall until it's time on the round. Depending on your opponent's board you might want to prioritize getting rid of their back row or monsters which is where Zaphion and Metaion come in. The draw cards are self explanatory, Advance Draw is a fantastic card to get rid of a Timelord before the end phase so that mystic mine can be kept in play, the same goes for Celestial Transformation as it will destroy the said monster during the end phase. The traps help with consistency and add even more draw power, and activating Infinite Light is pretty much a game ender as your opponent will have a real hard time getting rid of your monsters. Unless they drop down a kaiju or something but hey, deck has to have a weakness.  Side deck is filled with stuff to help you get rid of really problematic cards, Extravagance is there as card to experiment with as the extra deck is of almost no importance, however it does prevent you from drawing more cards which could conflict with using an Advance Draw, feel free to make any adjustments to it, I suggest teching in an Artifact Scythe and Sanctuary for some turn 1 options.  As much as I'm hyping these guys up they don't win as often as you'd like, any form of effect negation or spinning or non-destruction removal will shut these things down harder than a beaten up toaster, however if you like your duels to be nice and slow you'll have a lot of fun with the deck on a somewhat casual level. Hell, you might even take some opponents by surprise and get a few wins on tournaments, who knows."

Its by far the main and best part of almost any Blackwing deck, but of course, you can only have 3. Maybe something like Black Whirlwind but when you normal summon it brings a monster with less attack from grave to hand? I don't know, just a thought. It could be called Black Ominous Wind or something.  &nbsp;  Anyways, first up hopefully you drew into Black Whirlwind, if not, you can use this strategy if you have Simoon in your hand.  Activate his effect to banish a Blackwing, then activate the Black Whirlwind from deck and get the Normal Summon from Simoon, Use Whirlwind to bring Breeze (or Gale if you'd like) and Special Summon them, then, Link Summon Barricade Borg and discard a card for his effect.  Now when the Whirlwind gets sent to grave due to Simoon, you can add it to hand from grave due to Barricade.  &nbsp;  There are a lot of easy small combos such as:  Normal Summon Blizzard to Special one of the many lvl 4 monsters you could have in grave, allowing you to Synchro for Nothung or Armed Wing  Normal Blizzard, Special Kris and Bora for an instant Full Armor Master  Whirlwind can let you even Normal Breeze or Gale and bring Gladius to hand, which you can Special (if all you have is one Blackwing) to create a lvl 6 Synchro.  Shura attacking and killing something allows for a Blackwing with 1500 or less attack to be Specialed from deck (Preferably with Glowing Crossbow)  If you can bring Nothung out, and you have Auster in hand, you can Normal it (Cause of Nothung) then Synchro for Full Armor, IF YOU DO, then you can Banish Auster to put a Black Wedge counter on all monsters your opponent controls for Full Armor.  You can of course do the Utopia Combo with any combination of the many lvl 4 monsters.  &nbsp;  Good luck and enjoy"

Also, a new Fusion monster, ""The Dark Magicians"" with materials pretty easy for the deck summon that offers draw power and recursion,a fusion/ritual Quick-play Spell Card ""Secrets of Dark Magic"" and a Continuous Trap by the name ""Magicians' Combination"".  Because ""Magicians' Souls"" is currently so expensive, I tried to make most of the deck without it, taking into consideration that the card's main reason is to quickly access Dark Magician. I made use of a 3rd Apprentice Illusion Magician and Dark Magic Veil, and the deck ran pretty smoothly.  The reason I decided to make this deck is because, I didn't like the whole idea of building a deck that is going to take all my wallet money to play, and still having no chance against the meta.
