I wouldn't simply summon Atlantean's unless through an effect. Your main monsters are the Mermail. Deep Sea Dive is for the easy Synchro into Tatsunoko (I would special summon neptabyss for her effect) and then into largerÂ  synchro summons. Ash Blossom and Ghost Ogre is for support to stop opponent. Fishborg Launcher is also good for synchro summon if needed, but synchro isn't the main goal. The main monster is Abyssmegalo. Use Mastar Boy for ATK boost. Solemn Warning never hurts to have and stops big summons when you may have a weak-hand. Take advantage of Salvage and use Abyss spell on Abyssmegalo or Abyssteus(mainly Megalo)."

""<a title=""Shiranui Spectralsword"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Spectralsword"">Shiranui Spectralsword</a>"" is currently the only Tuner of the archetype and allows the player to Special Summon a Zombie-Type Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck, by banishing itself alongside with a non-Tuner Zombie-Type monster, both from the Graveyard. Although this Special Summon is not treated as a Synchro Summon, this effect allows the player to unleash monsters that would normally require specific Synchro Materials, notably ""<a title=""Archfiend Zombie-Skull"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Archfiend_Zombie-Skull"">Archfiend Zombie-Skull</a>"".  There are currently three boss monsters in the Archetype, all of them being Synchro Monsters: ""<a title=""Shiranui Samuraisaga"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Samuraisaga"">Shiranui Samuraisaga</a>"", ""<a title=""Shiranui Shogunsaga"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Shogunsaga"">Shiranui Shogunsaga</a>"" and ""<a title=""Shiranui Sunsaga"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shiranui_Sunsaga"">Shiranui Sunsaga</a>"". ""Shiranui Samuraisaga"" can recycle one of your banished ""Shiranui"" monsters and then restrain the opponent's aggression; if it ends up being banished, it can weaken one opposing monster's ATK by 500 points. ""Shiranui Shogunsaga"" has higher stats and a more straightforward set of effects: when it is Special Summoned by any means, it can banish one Zombie-Type monster from the Graveyard in order to raise its 3000 base ATK by an amount equal to the banished monster's ATK; this effect is obviously more powerful when its target is a ""Shiranui"" monster, that will have its second effect triggered. When it is destroyed, its owner can return one of their banished Zombies with 0 DEF to the Graveyard. ""Shiranui Sunsaga"" has the highest ATK of the group, at 3500. It's summon effect allows it to recycle any number of Zombie-Type Synchro monsters, banished or in the Graveyard, back into the Extra deck, then destroying cards the opponent controls up to the number of cards recycled by this effect. Its main power comes from its destruction negation, as it can prevent the destruction of any Zombie-type monster (by battle or card effect) by banishing a ""Shiranui"" monster from the graveyard, saving your monsters and activating the banished monstered effect. Each boss monster is two levels higher than the previous boss, allowing the effect of ""Shiranui Spectralsword"" to special summon the next boss monster should the previous one be destroyed.  LETS GO OVER THE 3 GANDORA'SÂ  their main effects banish and destroy cards while offering a atk boost but at a price. it halves your lp. but clears the field. giga is easy to summon (2 tributes from hand or field) while the others need tributes. to prevent bricking from high lvl cards i use montage dragon. heres how i go about this deck.  i use the grass looks greener to throw cards into the gy. youll notice that most of the cards have effects that activate when sent to the gy. this is the decks main defense and summon engine. while i wait for that... ill summon two level 4 monsters with mezuki, fairytail or a shiranuis effect. (fairy-tail and pot of desire will also help power giga-rays when the time comes) and special summon bagooska to give me time. and help set the field while offering effect negates. this is when i set cards like peropero or electroturtle if they are in hand.  after a couple turns of throwing cards into the grave and banish pile. i use spectralsword or anothers effect to special summon the higher lvl shiranui and keep that going to test and clear the field. just gage it from there. once you hit that point its extremly easy to spam the field. phantom chaos is in the deck to futher trigger gigas effect. other than that have fun. hope you guys like the deck!  &nbsp;  this is for the pc (og) version so i follow the banlist. but for mobile players (ygopro) add 2 more copies of the grass looks greener and take out a unizombie and book of life and youre set.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "

That's about it.,"<p><strong>Intro to the cards</strong></p> <p>The usual main attackers are Deskbot 001, Deskbot 004, Deskbot 007, Deskbot 008, and Deskbot 009. The support cards are Deskbot 002, Deskbot 003, Deskbot 005, Deskbot 006, and Deskbot Jet. All of the Deskbots, if they have the proper setup, can deal heavy damage. The four Pendulum Monsters are Deskbot 005, 006, 007, and 008. 007 and 008 are more attack based because their effects are aimed at them getting damage in. 005 and 006 are better for Pendulum Summoning and their effects are aimed at getting more Deskbots onto the field. Deskbot Jet is the Synchro Monster. It has two effects that can be activated, but only once per turn, and once that turn. It also has it's normal effect which boosts its power. The Field Spell, Deskbot Base, is sometimes annoying, sometimes helpful. It can boost all Deskbot monsters on the fields Attack and Defense by 500. This can ruin part of the strategy. It's more useful effects are as follows: Once per turn: You can reveal any number of ""Deskbot"" cards in your hand and shuffle them into the Deck, then draw the same number of cards. You can banish 9 ""Deskbot"" cards with different names from your field and/or Graveyard, except ""Deskbot Base""; shuffle all cards from your opponent's hand, field and Graveyard into the Deck. The more useful out of the useful effects is shuffling and drawing cards. It can help refresh a bad hand. The other effect is situational.</p> <p><strong>How to play them</strong></p> &nbsp;  I'm going to show you a combo I love to use with this deck. The ideal hand is as follows (If you are going first); Machine Duplication, Deskbot 003, Deskbot 005/006, Bottomless Trap Hole/Raigeki/Twin Twisters, and Deskbot 009. Place Deskbot 003, and activate his effect to Special Summon a Monster, but don't use his second effect. Special Summon Deskbot 002, and activate its effect. Add either Deskbot 005/006 to the hand (Depends on which one you got in the starting hand. If you got 005, add 006 and vice versa). Use Machine Duplication on Deskbot 002, Special Summon the two others in your deck, activate their effects. When it asks you what to add to the hand, add Deskbot Base and Deskbot 007/008 to your hand. Put 005 and 006 into the Spell/Trap Card Zones, Special Summon Deskbot 009. Place down the Bottomless Trap Hole/Twin Twisters. Activate Desktop Base, and if you want, exchange some cards. If you have yet to do so, activate Deskbot 003's effect. Use it on Deskbot 009, and once you do, activate 009's effect (Be amazed!). End your turn, and try to keep Deskbot 003 alive. This is just an example of a combo that you can use, but find more yourself.  &nbsp; <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p> &nbsp;  A few major weaknesses this deck has are: Mirror Force (Any kind), Effect Negating Cards, Solemn Cards, getting a bad hand, and misclicks.  &nbsp; <p><strong></strong>Thank you to anyone that looks at this. Enjoy the deck!</p>"

Link Format,"This deck uses Trickstar, but also takes advantage of the Star-Seraph engine. You have two options you can usually do. You can either use the Star Seraph or the Trickstars. For the Trickstars the usually combos <strong>ALWAYSÂ </strong>Candina or Lightstage. Depending on your hand of course, I would get lightstage on the board then search Candina or Lycorissia (depending on your hand) and use Candina to search Lycorissica or Trickstar Reincarnation. From there search out Candina for Lycorissica and activate Reincarnation to get big damage. There's multiple ways to pull this off, but the main goal is to bring out holly angel or decode talker to take out your opponent. Don't force the link summon though you have XYZ and synchro for a reason.  Star Seraph engine explains itself, summon all 3 to get sentry on the field to take out 1 pesky card. The synchros are meant for Lycorissica and Gofu. I would always resort to Beelze as it is easy to summon and hard to get off the field for some unprepared decks. Double summon is meant to help combos, dark hole, and raigeki for protection. The Solemn cards and Ash Blossom will help stop your oppoenent from advancing their board. Overall, more Trickstars is needed for the TCG and until then combining types is the best method."

IT DOES NOT relay on that card. World Chalice takes practice and a great intro into the link-format.Â  In the general sense you want to summon Link Spider and Imduk for additional summons. Eve the Shrine Maiden is a link card not meant for the extra monster zone. She can protect everything she points to from card effects and she can't be destroy by battle or card effect so she is very handy. I would focus on getting on Borreload or Aurum immediately. Use each spell card wisely and experiment to find out their purpose they can be used multiple ways. The World Legacy and Guarddragon are meant for the graveyard to recycle cards back on the field or to the field. So use them for link summoning. Use Imduk ability in the grave to get World Legacy on the field.  Only 3 traps which help recycle or special summon. Solemn Strike because you can't go wrong with that card. This deck is a good intro into Link summoning in general and if the cards are played right this can take out meta decks."
