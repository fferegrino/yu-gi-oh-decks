First turn setups are less about putting several negates/floodgates up and moreso about establishing a variety of different disruption, protection, and floating effects via backrow, monster effects, and GY setup, then pushing through whatever your opponent throws at you while accruing card advantage. OTKs come easy thanks to huge stat totals as well as Quaeritis's ATK zeroing and easy access to the Numeron Dragon package. Guardian Chimera fits perfectly into the deck, providing strong removal and cycling on a big body while triggering Despia on-Fusion effects, making it pretty much your best choice when using Branded in Red. In conlusion, Konami, please don't ban/limit Aluber just because you decided to print a bunch of broken Branded/Albaz support that doesn't do anything for this deck."

A kingdom of sweets. An enigma to the people that visit this enchanted land. Ruled bya  monarch, the kingdom resembles a landscape made of various confections, with all the edibility that entails. The residents there are even strnagers, resembling plastic dolls or plush toys, thought inquiries into that are usually met with confusion.

The two princesses are the talk of the kingdom. the heiress known as <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Puddingcess</a> lives a charmed life as she attends her royal duties, prepares to inherit the throne, and tries to keep her little sister out trouble. Recent gossip claims that she is enamored with ser <a data-name=""Madolche Chouxvalier"">Chouxvalier</a>, but he seems reluctant to confirm it. Among the nobility lie the royal staff, including the royal teacher <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Glassouffle</a>, the clergywoman <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Sistart</a> and the angel she is in communion with, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Anjelly</a>.

Visitors are often left charmed by the kingdom's delights, thought her political neighbors often suspect something amiss, as if there is a fey air around it. Interestingly, a young child with an expansive doll collection went missing a year before contact with the kingdom as established, and no records tell of the kingdom's existence before that point, furthermore the missing child bore an uncanny resemblance to <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Queen Tiaramisu</a>...""

Well I haven't made a post in a while and I had some decks IRL to adapt to this site's decklist so I'd thought I'd rectify that for once. Be warned thought some aspects of this list are, puns aside, half-baked.

The gameplan of the scrumptious Madolche kingdom seems to emphasize Summoning (mainly from the deck) and their adorable princesses, the eldest of which being needed for certain cards in the archetype to get bonus effects and herself has an Xyz variant that serves as a beater and another way to pull from the deck. The last common ingredient is a reliance on continuous backrow cards. They are predisposed for going second but have tools to weather the storm should they have to go first (of course some of those tools are out of theme and not ones I can apply to the deck yet).

The main playmakers are <a data-name=""Madolche Magileine"">Madolche Magileine</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Petingcessoeur"">Madolche Petingcessoeur</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Anjelly"">Madolche Anjelly</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Hootcake"">Madolche Hootcake</a>. Hooty and Angelly here both summon direclty from the deck, as does Petingcessoeur, but in her case that is meant to bring out her big sister, <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess"">Madolche Puddingcess</a> as the kid reduces the level of any monster she summons and otherwise messes up the Rank 4 plays with any other monster. Magileine OTOH is just a searcher, but one with no HOPT.

Another important card is <a data-name=""Madolche Messingelato"">Madolche Messingelato</a> who can fetch a needed spell card if he's special summoned. <a data-name=""Madolche Mewfeuille"">Madolche Mewfeuille</a> is another normal summon that can summon out another Madolche from your hand. Madolche Cruffsant meanwhile is card that bounces a Madolche to grant himself a level and 300 ATK, a little niche TBF but it is another way for Rank 4 plays and helping proc certain cards.

Moving onto the spells we have <a data-name=""Madolche Chateau"">Madolche Chateau</a>, <a data-name=""Madolche Salon"">Madolche Salon</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Ticket"">Madolche Ticket</a>, all of which are important to the strategy and play off of each other in interesting ways. Chateau is a field spell that brings every doll in the GY back to the deck to ensure certain effects are live and if any subsequent monsters left there are returned to the deck you have the option of bringing them to the hand instead (and it has a 500 ATK boost to Madolche monsters). This brings us to Ticket which can special summon or search monsters every time Madolche cards are returned to the hand or main deck. Last but not least is Salon, which gives us an extra normal summon (Notable because the archetype does have a few cards that plus on normal summon, two of whcih were already mentioned and of those two at least one isn't HOPT) and also helps to search backrow

&nbsp;

Moving onto the traps. <a data-name=""Madolche Lesson"">Madolche Lesson</a> is a simple 800 ATK boost, decent by the standards of such powerups but the effect itself is mediocre since the focus is away from the battle phase. still it can help close out games considering that Puddingcess's Xyz version can reach 3800 with this and Chateau active. <a data-name=""Madolche Nights"">Madolche Nights</a> serves as a monster negate and with Puddingcess herself out a way to remove a card by returning it to the deck. <a data-name=""Madolchepalooza"">Madolchepalooza</a> is...mostly there for fun, the effect to summon any amount of in theme monsters form your hand is nice but kinda wasteful economy wise given they will all return to the deck at the end and as a trap you can't use thus turn one. <a data-name=""Madolche Promenade"">Madolche Promenade</a> is the deck's best trap yet, negating a monster in exchange for bouncing one of your own, while also have an effect that lets you attach a Madolche monster to one of their xyz.

Onto the Extra deck, the off-theme ones were cobbled together from cards I have that weren't in another deck. ranging from the metaish such as <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crisadia Avramax</a>  to some small utility like <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and <a data-name=""Barricadeborg Blocker"">Barricadeborg Blocker</a>, to the less played such as <a data-name=""Evigishki Merrowgeist"">Evigishki Merrowgeist</a> and <a data-name=""Topologic Trisbaena"">Topologic Trisbaena</a>. Of course the majority of the ED is dedicated to copies of the 4 in theme monsters. Staring with the OG boss monster, <a data-name=""Madolche Queen Tiaramisu"">Madolche Queen Tiaramisu</a>. Tiaramisu is a primarily reason why the deck wants to go second as her effect a powerful piece of removal with a rate quality that moots certain forms of responses and ""cannot be targeted"" effects. For going first we have <a data-name=""Madolche Fresh Sistart"">Madolche Fresh Sistart</a> and <a data-name=""Madolche Teacher Glassouffle"">Madolche Teacher Glassouffle</a>, which serve to protect your backrow and one of your monsters, respectably. the latter also has a nifty recycling effect that procs when another Madolche goes to the GY, helping to keep your GY clean. The last monster is <a data-name=""Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode"">Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-mode</a>. Puddingcess here taking on a new dress, 1500 extra ATK and the ability to summon a mosnter from the dekc (provided Puddingcess herself is an overlay unit, this explains Petingcesouer and Prominade's effects)

Madolche Butlerusk is another monster that search a card on Normal summon, however instead of a Madolche cards it is instead a field spell. the catch is that you need another Madolche monster to use it, if you're wondering why this dude wasn't teched in every deck that uses a field spell. He's here more becuase of the fact that I don't currently run Terraforming and Metaverse (despite having a lot of copies of them, I am considering them of course)

<a data-name=""Madolche Tea Break"">Madolche Tea Break</a> is a counterpart to Nights, whereas Nights responds to Monster effects, this card responds to spells, and like Nights,m it also has a Puddingcess reliant bonus effect. In this case popping a card. <a data-name=""Madolche Waltz"">Madolche Waltz</a> is in the side deck concept for some cute Game 3 memes, as it is a burn card that deals 300 damage each time one of your dolls battle, it can also potentially close out games (Puddingcess Chocolat with 3800 ATK plus this means up to 4100 damage), but the changes are minor.

Last card of note is <a data-name=""Trap Trick"">Trap Trick</a>. This one helps search your Normal Traps provided you can spare a copy of the one you want to search and lets you activate it the same turn. Naturally if I do have these in the IRL deck the ratios of some of the traps would bump up.

thus ends my Madolche deck profile. I am aware that this is half baked and that other options are available (Traptrix Raflessia+Gravedigger's for starters). It is for that reason that I will appreciate any feed back you have on this deck. Especially where the Extra is concerned."

Spiral Cards are HEAVILY DEPENDENT of his field spell but can compensate it using more traps not like Gravekepper's that you can't get around it.

Fish Sonar is really good here, good at a point that you don't need to use Phantasm Spiral trash equip spells to summon Phantasm Spiral Dragon.

Since this is meant to be a control deck, you don't need to use the level 8 XYZ and Phantasm Spiral, you can trade that for more traps like dogmstika punishment and fill you extra deck with cards akin to N'tss or add level 2 normal water aqua monsters to get Toadally Awesome out more frequently."

It actually provides in archetype interruption which is very new to a deck like D/D/D, it allows you to lock yourself up now with the fiend locks and the like and still build a semi solid board.

The griffon is a neato card, it comes with a free extension, a trade in effect to flush out your hand, and a search if summoned from the graveyard, the problem is getting it to your graveyard but it can search any D/D card in general which is good considering the trap that’ll be reviewed later, all three of these effects suffer from hard opt but you can definitely trigger multiple effects in a turn.

Patented is kinda a funny card, I get the idea and it looks like it’ll work but I haven’t taken it for testing just yet, on the bright side it does recycle when it goes bye so spell and trap removal will trigger it and you’ll likely be able to get it out again via recycling.

D/D/D headhunt is actually really good, you can steal stuff and make them D/D/D monsters! In the zoodiac matchup if you trigger it on your turn and steal a big stack you can make a ridiculous makina

makina is a once per chain interruption which is really good because it can keep on stealing things again and again and it allows you to get its effect 3 straight times if you manage resolve thomas pop a pend zone to summon a ddd (most likely requium) overlay into dark Armageddon, take the popped card as overlay, recycle a graveyard contract if possible, then solo overlay into makina."

You can also use tenyis instead of token for synchro but I prefer to use tenyis for support effect. This deck very solid and your main goal is to summon Cheng Ying, the Grand Swordsoul Duke and Chi Xiao, the Grand Swordsoul Swordmaster have a strong board (often deadly)
- Here is a cool OTK combo to do if you have Tai A, the Swordsoul Swordmaster and Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda (and nothing on your board at that turn)

+ Activate the ability of Vishuda to sp-summon it (special summon). Link summon Monk using Vishuda as material.

+ Then normal summon Tai A then activate Tai A effect to summon a token by banishing Vishuda. Then synchro summon Chi Xiao. Then activate Chi Xiao when synchro summoned to add Long Yuan in to your hand (if you can/want to OTK) or add Sudden Shift as a control card (I gonna assume we added Long Yuan), also activate Tai A when send to GY (graveyard) effect to send Tenyi Spirit - Adhara to the GY

+ Banish Adhara from the GY to add back Vishuda from the banished zone. Then activate Long Yuan effect, tribute Vishuda to summon Long Yuan and also summon the token. Then synchro summon Cheng Ying, then activate Long Yuan effect in the GY to deal 1200 damage to your opponent.
<h4 class=""engine-dark-box""> Now you have a Monk, Chi Xiao and Cheng Ying on the board which normally have a total damage of 6900 damage meanwhile your opponent has 6800. ALSO DONT FORGET that you also have a vishuda in the GY which you can banished it and remove 1 of your opponent card from the field, which also activate Cheng Ying effect to banish 2 more cards (1 from your opponent field, 1 from their GY), WHICHHHHH increase the damage of Cheng Ying by another 300.</h4>
<h4>You can go a step further if you can special summon 1 more monster (mostly by Ashuna or by Swordsoul Sacred Summit), you can link up to Shaman of the Tenyi using the Monk and the 1 normal monster you summoned, then activate Shaman, discard 1 card then bring back the Monk. Now your field end up with Cheng Ying, ChiXiao, Monk and Shaman</h4>
If you can go for both Cheng Ying , and Qixing thats a very very fun, OP combo. Banish, banish, destroy, destroy

Pros:
<ul>
 	<li> Easy to execute combos</li>
 	<li>Have pretty strong effect/removal</li>
 	<li>DESTRUCTIVE</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
 	<li>Get countered by Macro Cosmos/Mystic mine</li>
 	<li>Your combos can be ruined by card effect like Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence soo make sure you have a backup plan</li>
 	<li>Token collector (but for some reason I dont see much)</li>
</ul>

It's hard finding 1 card engines with consistency cards, few bricks, and little conflicting with Necrovalley, but Toad is a card.

So, the list started with me thinking that Necrovalley is pretty good right now, we're in a format where two of the top decks are kind of in a league of their own, and Necrovalley is very disruptive to both of them, especially Drytron. It's also such an appealing engine to run, because you have so many copies of Necrovalley. Since it is good right now it has an edge over other field spell floodgates. However, Necrogoon is a little bit linear and relies a lot on Dragoon. Sure it usually puts up a Dragoon, but 1 negate + Necrovalley seems a little easy to out, provided people are prepared for a meta with Dragoon in it.

Dogmatika was the easy alternative engine to pair with it. Getting an interruption or three off of easy cards and searching backrow works well with the plan of Royal Tribute and traps, and there is no conflict with Necrovalley. The Fish part came in later in deckbuilding - I was basically looking for a 7 card engine, 3 starters 3 consistency cards and a brick, that could summon from the Extra Deck for Ecclesia, and worked under Necrovalley or at least could play around it being on the table. Invoked was the first thing I tested, but I found the engines conflicted too much to make Mechaba reliable. Destiny Hero would be appealing, save that Phoenix Enforcer can't revive itself under Necrovalley. I tried a few other small engines before remembering that Beautunaful Princess was a card and settled on the fish engine. It's actually pretty good, 1 card starter that gets you an omni-negate that pops with upside, and while it conflicts slightly it is really minor, and it was the perfect size, 3 consistency cards, 3 starters, and 1 brick. The brick is even not a brick sometimes.

The interruption suite has basically remained the same since inception, you need cards that don't conflict with Royal Tribute and are high impact."

The deck is basically a pile of cards that search Necrovalley, a pile of cards that make Dragoon, some Pots, some Traps, and 3 copies of Royal Tribute. The game plan is simple, you establish Necrovalley + Dragoon and hope that it is enough to deal with everything they've got, and maybe occasionally Royal Tribute them.

So, 3 Necrovalley and a Terraforming seems obligatory. Necrovalley is the whole point of this deck, and you really want to maximize naturally drawing this card over searching it, and Terraforming remains the best way to search it. 3 Gravekeeper's Commandant seems like overkill but I want to try it out at 3 before trimming it back - it is effectively more copies of Necrovalley, which could be redundant run in these numbers but helps ensure you actually see Necrovalley. Necrovalley Throne searches for Commandant to find you Necrovalley, but I like this card more because it also searches for Headman for access to Dragoon, meaning seeing this alongside Commandant makes Necrovalley + Dragoon boards. 1 Headman to enable this. We're on 3 Red-Eyes Fusion and 3 Red-Eyes Insight to search Red-Eyes Fusion, with the bricks these entail. These are for easy access to Dragoon, which protects Necrovalley and is hard to out and a source of pressure, all at the same time. This card is stupid. We have 3 Royal Tribute. These can be a defensive card if you already have Necrovalley, but are mostly an offensive card to just shut opponents down by destroying all of their starters. 3 Droplets, these should just be a staple in most deck lists this format, even though we run low monster count this card is still just incredible. 3 Pot of Extravagence. You need card advantage in this deck, and you need to eat up those Ash Blossoms, as not a lot else stops your deck, but Ash really does hit both sides of the trick. 1 Called By the Grave, another way to eat up those Ashes, I'd make space for 3 if I could. 3 Torrential Tribute with 1 Fury to search it. This card doesn't pop Dragoon and combined with Solemn Strike will eat up whole combo boards, and is really powerful, so even though the spell telegraphs it I thought 4 in the main was a good idea. Lastly, I'm on the Solemn brigade, 3 Judgment and 3 Strike. Strike is really good alongside Dragoon or Torrential Tribute, and is just generically good going first or going second. I wanted some Judgment in the 55 for games 2 and 3 when the disruption comes in, but I'd prefer to main the card and side cards that are more impactful in specific matchups or circumstances. The card is amazing going first and still pretty good going second, and is a great generic answer to most sources of pressure an opponent can apply.

So, working through some probabilities, I discovered the deck has just under a 75% chance of making Dragoon and just over a 75% chance to make Necrovalley. This is pretty good all things considered, but it did change my attitude about Pot of Prosperity. You'll only get both on the field in about 50% of your games without it, but it improves your odds of making both greatly by standing in for either, digging 6 cards deeper into your deck. The maths started to get way above my head for just a children's card game, but you should see Necrovalley + Dragoon in over half of your games without Prosperity, and Prosperity should theoretically improve your odds of making both together, with 6 cards and several 2 card combos standing in for Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, and 9 cards total representing Necrovalley. The reason I'm off Terraforming is running the 1 Terraforming seems a little too redundant while not actually improving our final odds by that much, and Commandant represents part of a 2 card combo to make Necrovalley + Dragoon. The other adjustment is running copies of Needle Ceiling to represent more Torrentials without giving up the game.

Nope, I was wrong. Extravagence is better in this deck. You need raw cards for Dragoon and you're consistent enough in seeing Necrogoon before the Prosperity. In every test hand I saw it Extravagence was comparable or straight better. Extravagence is still a decent consistency boost in a deck with such high odds of seeing your players, and it plays well with traps and Dragoon."

Anyways, i tried my best to make metalfoes can go against MORE decks, thats why i ain't using Super Polymerization because even if it make a good Synergy it's not good enough.

Just a combo idea:

Normal summon Rescue Rabbit ~Activate Rescue Rabbit and summon any normal monster ~link summon 2 link spiders using the normal monsters ~Verte Anaconda.

This can be done in various ways since it's a pendulum archtype.

The ideal first turn board (and the best i could think) is having a dragoon, Alkahest, 1 Fullmetalfoes Fusion and 1 ""Metalfoes"" monster. This combination gives you one negate and two ways to get cards out the field, so, three disruptions if you use in the right timing.

I just realized that maybe DPhoenix Enforcer can be even better then Dragoon in this deck because of his destructive effects, but now is too late to change!

I aim to do another metalfoes deck soon.

The goal is either to combo out one of the Red Dragon Archfiend monsters turn one and wipe your opponent's board or to play a slower control style continuously bringing back Summoned Skull until your opponent has run out of options. This deck is NOT meant for the meta but is fun to play against other nostalgic or casual decks.

It's a fun deck that I am happy to say that I have finished building.

I've wanted to play Adamancipators since Secret Slayers, but as a budget-ish player, I really couldn't afford the deck but the 2021 Mega-Tins have really helped a lot with the building of this deck, and this list was really inspired by the list that Farfa used in his sub-a-thon in his match vs Mystic Mine Fossils ( Yes, the one he got 2-0'd by XD ) and then I went around my local game shops and anime stores to see if anyone had the titular rocks, and thankfully they did. I'm really hyped to play this deck and hopefully I can do pretty well with this deck. If y'all have any suggestions for the deck, feel free to comment it, and I am down to try out the suggestions that y'all put. Thx.

-Update-

I got roasted by Farfa over the past weekend and I've got to say that it was hilarious. I also pulled a <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - &lt;a data-name=&quot;Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer&quot;&gt;Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;"">Destiny HERO - </a><a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> after 1 and 1/2 booster boxes. I've been play testing it, and I personally feel like it is working better but it might be a short term effect befire my ratio-ing takes a noticable affect, so I will be tinkering with the build a lot more. If you can play Dragoon, I would say play it over DPE.

-Update - 2022 Edition-

Holy Moly has this deck gone some good, and I've got new goodies for the deck, so let's see where it will take us.

As the title says, I have been enlightened by my peers. My locals has 2 other PK players and they've suggested me some ideas. One of which is adding Sangan to the deck to search out handtraps mid combo, The other is more Junk Forwards. Why? Because having much more consistent access to a free special summon just for not having monsters. Another major thing of note: This is not a Dark Requiem build, nor is it a kali yuga build.

So the play is:

Danger engine to mill unwanted hands, the new myutant support FIXES FOLLOW UP PLAYS, so that means no more zombies! We can use dogmatika engine for extra control and interruption! myutants rely on the main deck monster and the extra deck monster only on the opponents turn, so, punishment doesnt realy hurt the deck if you use it to interupt a important play from your opponent! Side deck is optional but, i do recomend having TTT in the deck to help against heavy hand traps decks you might encounter or even dragoon!

If you already know myutant well i recomend this deck to further complicate the deck and make it more stronger, if you are new to myutant, i HIGHLY recomend you play my danger zombie version to learn myutant combo decks, since i dont build the pure versions usually!

Mutator is the bread and butter of the deck, every time i got my normal summon negated, mutator was there to save the day! so USE IT TO EXTEND OR BAIT."

Step 2: You must special summon <a data-name=""Allvain the Essence of Vanity"">Allvain the Essence of Vanity</a> and normal summon a monster.
Step 2: Link summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and activate its effect.
Step 3: Summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> from deck using Halqifibrax effect.
Step 4: Make <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado"">Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado</a>n +3 tokens and Summon Deskbot 001 using it's effect.
Step 4: Synchro summon <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> using 2 tokens and Deskbot 001. With Shooting riser's effect you must send a level 2 monster to the grave for the next step of the combo. (Ex: <a data-name=""PSY-framegear Gamma"">PSY-framegear Gamma</a>).
Step 5: Synchro Summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> and PROFIT. The combo can continue in many paths from here but for the sake of efficiency I will end it here.

Notes:
Use <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> only after you exhausted all your other combo options, because it locks you out of summoning anything but Fusions.
When <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a> is used in conjunction with <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> it is a devastating combo."

The field spell is kinda nuts against the right deck. Headhunt is a neat piece of interuption searchable off of griffon. Machina is just a great all around boss monster, although I struggle to make it with more than three materials.

For the older cards of note, zero king is insane, azathot is banned for a reason and this is just an in theme version of that card. Swirl slime is the heart and soul of this deck, if you don't draw this card, you basically can't access any lines from what I've tested. Lamia is jet synchron for the deck.

I've opted for a more adaptable and flexible version of the deck. Some opt for a more all in combo approach for the deck, I suck at the combos for this deck anyhow, so the simpler combos makes it a bit easier.

The main end boards mostly include a level eight synchro and halq to go into baroness on the next turn, big gungis is a decent end board card. Machina is good if it goes off, and big caesar is a summon negate.

The side deck is tech options.

I would like to make a full on guide on the deck, but I suck at it any help and advice would be nice, the deck is very much a WIP

<span>Tell me if you have any idea how to improve consistency and anti-meta nature of the deck</span>

The strategy is to gain as much LP as possible from your opponent's plays, gaining advantage from the LP gained, and to OTK with Mars

&nbsp;

Main deck:

<em>The Agent of Force - Mars</em> is unaffected by spell cards and can't be ashed. It gains ATK equal to the positive difference of LP between you and your opponent when <em>The Sanctuary in the Sky</em> is on the field

<em>Nova Summoner</em> and <em>The Agent of Mystery - Earth </em>(tuner of the deck) are bodies and searchers for <em>The Agent of Force - Mars</em>

<em>Zeradias, Herald of Heaven</em> is a good level 4 Fairy monster and a searcher for<em> The Sanctuary in the Sky</em>

The 2 <em>Performapal Kuribohble</em> and the 1 <em>Checksum Dragon</em> works as the three battle faders with the advantage of making you gain LP

<em>The Agent of Life - Neptune</em> and <em>Master Hyperion</em> are plan B. The first allowing you to special summon Mars from graveyard if necessary and the latter being an easily summonable beatstick with a destruction effect

<em>Ghost sister</em> <em>&amp; spooky dogwood</em> and <em>Child's play</em> are the two best LP gain card under normal playing conditions (which isnt the case of <em>Soul Absorption</em>)

<em>The Sanctuary of Parsath</em> works as a clone of <em>The Sanctuary in the Sky</em> to increase the probability of Mars having his attack boost

<em>Gingebread House</em> is a tech card that allows you to get rid of your opponent's monsters that have more than 2500ATK while gaining 500LP for each monster destroyed. Its a bit slow and risky, so it has been replaced by a 2nd <em>Mystic Mine</em> to stall if you dont have<em> The Sanctuary in the Sky</em>

<em>Divine Punishment</em> is a type specific <strong>solemn</strong> to save your monsters

<em>Dried Winds</em> is a continuous trap that allows you to destroy a monster every time you gain LP

<em>Rainbow life</em> is the best LP gain trap card, which can be activated in any players turn, can be chained to its destruction, and is effective the whole turn its activated to convert monsters attacks into LP gains

&nbsp;

Extra deck:

<em>Dispatchparazzi</em> is a Link 2 that allows you to redirect all attack to it, thus saving a monster of choice, while gaining half of the attacking monster's ATK as LPs. <em>Sweet Majoram</em> is a <em>Dried Winds</em> searcher as well as a <em>Dried Winds</em> on legs, allowing you to destroy a monster every turn in which you gain LP. <em>Ancient Sacred Wyvern</em> is the synchro version of Mars, non-dependant on a field spell, with a 2100 base attack that can be revived by paying 1000LP.<em> Colossal Fighter</em> works in a loop with <em>Rainbow life</em> to make you gain any amount of LP you want if it attacks a monster with higher ATK than itself as it revives at will. <em>Celestial Knightlord Parsarth</em> is a link 3 that can search every card with<em> ""The Sanctuary in the Sky""</em> in its text."

Use the diverse array of water attribute cards in this deck to cool down your hard hitting Cyberse Link monsters!,"Altered Marincess deck with a full Link card extra deck. Based on mixing my favorite attribute (Water), with my favorite card type (Link), as well as my favorite species (Cyberse) . I was lucky the Marincess archetype existed, as without it these 3 concepts would not gel smoothly at all. The strategy for this deck is simple, Marincess Marbled Rock is your ace monster, use either her or Marincess Great Bubble Reef and ramp their power using the effect monsters in the deck such as Marincess Star Fish! Most of your high in monsters have solid defense provided from the trap cards as well as some of the other Link Marincess girls providing a nice shield from card effects and battle damage. You may be wondering about Relinquished Anima, and to be honest, I just like him :) use the DeepSea MacroTrema to get him on the field and be mean! Any other cards that may seem out of place are used to either ramp your more efficient cards, or are used in a specific way to effect combat specific situations (Like ShootingCode Talker). All in all this deck was made for me to have fun with! I hope you can appreciate this deck as much as I do!"
