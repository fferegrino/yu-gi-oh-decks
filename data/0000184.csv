The red eyes monster might feel out of place but it can be special summoned by banishing a dragon, something this deck has plenty of, and then lets you special summon a dragon once during each main phase for free, from the graveyard or the hand, this provides plenty of recycling considering all but one of your level 8 monsters are dragons as are five of the available tuners. Metaltron requires three tributes but will let you tribute continuous spells and traps as substitutes for monsters and he is level 9 so while he can brick he helps  somewhat, plus call of the haunted doesn't leave the field unless the card it brought back was destroyed so if you use the monster it brought back as a tribute for something, it will just sit there clogging up a backrow space. but you can tribute it to summon Metaltron which makes him more useful. And Cloudcastle revives a level 9 when summoned but prevents level 8 or lower monsters from attacking the turn they were summoned."

The entire core of Orcust is really cheap (besides Girsu).  My advice is to take your money and invest it into stonks that cover a variety of future-proof innovations, like the development of nuclear fusion generators and oversized bananas for scale.  No? .... Oke!  Jokes aside, this deck can be very fun! It has taken part in the imnious ""Eternal Format"", and who knows? As things develop, maybe we will return to it after the next ban list. Or should we ask: Did we really ever left it?  The side deck presents hopes, dreams and disappointment and can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!  &lt;&lt; Edit:  For SOME reason I didn't include Foolish Burrial in the deck list. I took out One for One for it.  Orcust Cymbal went from 2 to 3.  Orcust Bass went from 2 to 1.  I took out Dingirsu for a Linkuribo. &gt;&gt;  &nbsp;"

Now the film also becomes a game. <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/balsinjehan</a>  The game in question is simply called ""Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game"" and seems to be inspired by 90's beat em up games like ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time"" and ""Final Fight"". <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/jombikeuleoswi-heili</a>  The game was apparently created after fans sent in ideas for a ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" game, where Narayan from India and Ricky from the USA won. The developers behind it are Digital Eclipse, which made some games in the 90's and made itself known for releasing old games in new formats. <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/yeol-ahob</a>  The premise of ""Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game"" seems simply inspired by the movie where the playable characters LeBron James, Snurre Sprätt and Lola must fight The Goon Squad to get out of Warner Bros.'s servers and save the basketball star's kidnapped son. <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/goegimaensyon</a>  Also read: The first trailer for ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" has landed <a>https://yourdramainfo.wildapricot.org/bichnaneun-sungan</a>  The game will be released exclusively to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription service on July 1st. As of July 15, however, it is free to play on the Microsoft Store.  The film ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" has its Swedish cinema premiere on July 16. In addition to Looney Tunes characters, we can expect to see plenty of other Warner Bros.-owned characters from movies such as ""The Matrix"", ""The Iron Giant"" and ""A Clockwork Orange""."

This is not the typical control style Sky Strikers deck. This deck is very aggressive.  Crystron Halqifibrax is the easiest way into Accesscode so having access to a tuner is of course required. Shaddoll Falco, Effect Veiler and Instant Fusion facilitate this requirement.  <strong>Shaddoll</strong>  Shaddoll Fusion will bring out Winda or Construct, and can also send Raye or Roze to the GY.

Kaiju and Barriers. Puppet Queen is an OCG exclusive atm. ,"<span>WR Meteoragon 2600</span>  <span>WR Bashileos 2700</span>  <span>War Rock X</span>  <span>Puppet Queen 2200</span>  <span>Puppet King 2800</span>  <span>+600 War Rock</span>  <span>+1000 for 2 turns </span>  <span>Solemn Strike</span>  <span>Negate </span>  <span>So, I've been keeping my eyes on War Rocks even with all the hate it's been getting. I especially love the Myutants-angle when people discuss their hate for War Rocks. </span>  <span>Over the last month-ish I've been stockpiling bad cards ahead of the Armageddon. With the introduction of another hate magnet of a card. Puppet Queen. I've been digging deeper in bad side of bad decks and then I see that there is a bit of hope coming in the direction of War Rocks and pure warrior decks. Though this hope is very basic. It is not a combo-enabler. Or 1 card AAccesspollousa. It won't even contribute to the traditional concept of control. I just saw a potentially, oppressive board that made me think of an old movie with a tide turning ambush scene.</span>  <span>First off, this deck to work. You need access to a War Rock Mountain to get your War Rock targets out. A Puppet Queen in hand and a lv7 Warrior in GY or hand. You have to manage to get 1-2 warrior's on board with Queen in hand and a target for her effect.</span>  <span>Queen's effect is to SS a lv7 and buff the board (of Warriors) by 1000 until the end of the next turn. 2 turns.</span>  <span>So, with 2-3 War Rocks and Puppet Queens boost. That will be a 1400-1600 attack boost to your War Rocks, for 2 turns.</span>  <span>Meteoragon with boost, can sit at  3600-4200 and can attack two targets with 1 of it's own monster effects and lockdown monster effects during Battle Phase</span>  <span>Bashileos can/will be able to attack directly with 3700-4300+.</span>  <span>Then add another 400-600 Atk boost to your War Rocks if your opponent doesn't read your cards and tries to attack during their turn. </span>  <span>Anyways, I'm playing around this pile of cards and searching for consistency cards to get out early high level warriors and the field spell. Field spell support that doesn't help War Rock Mountain miss timing. There is not a lot of generic Field Spell support that gets around a ""when"" condition. AND! War Rocks are missing better ways to get it out outside of Fortia attacking or being attacked. It's kind of of a sad situation... </span>  <span>Anyways(again), I've been toying around with basic hand traps, Kaiju's and a barrier statue.  With the lopsided loadout; They have been proving too strong against weak decks to properly test progress and too often, too slow against proper rogue and meta decks. So, I am trying to find a middle ground while keeping the identity of the deck.</span>  <span>What I would love to see added (now that they are imported over to the OCG is): An Archetypal Field Spell/Spell card search that immediately activates. A counter trap or strong board disruption to assist and coordinate you into the Battle Phase. Like, a battle prep kind of effect. </span>  I'm actually currently using a 42 version of all this."

Synchros always have been my favorite amongst all other monsters and since I never got around into making a full deck back then, I thought it would be a good idea to make it now. After some trial and error I came up with this:  &nbsp;  Summon Dux and Phalanx with Dragunity Whirlwind, synchro summon Vajrayana, equip then summon Phalanx with its own effect, normal summon Deep Sea Diva, then another one from the deck with its effect, then synchro summon Red Supernova Dragon.  &nbsp;  Special summon Ice Bell, then Glass Bell, then Snow Bell, then synchro summon Clear Wing Synchro Dragon (first) then Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon (second).  &nbsp;  Ideal conditions to bring Ruddy Rose Dragon: normal summon White Rose Dragon, then special summon from your hand or GY (can be sent there with Foolish Burial) one Red Rose Dragon. Synchro summon Black Rose Dragon, then using Red Rose's effect special summon Roxrose Dragon from your hand or deck, then all you have left to do is synchro summon Ruddy Rose Dragon using both monsters as materials.  OR (the hard, unorthodox way)  Synchro Summon Black Rose Dragon using Angraecum Umbrella and another level 4* monster, then you can clear the field, use Stardust Shimmer or Monster Reborn to bring him back, activate Double Summon and summon a level 3* tuner, then synchro summon Ruddy Rose Dragon. If you don't have Double Summon in your hand at the time, you can wait a turn, use Stardust Shimmer, then normal summon the level 3* tuner.  Tip: Once you clear the field with Black Rose Dragon you can freely use your Ice Bell to summon Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon  &nbsp;  Disclaimer: I moved these cards to the side deck bc of how inconsistent this combo was during each duel (it can work but its kinda hard to pull off in THIS deck, might have to make a seperate one just for that). Anyway.....  Using One For One, summon Glow-Up Bulb, send Dandylion to graveyard. Summon 2 tokens, then synchro summon Formula Synchro. After that, normal summon Debris Dragon then using its effect, special summon Dandylion. Synchro summon Stardust Dragon, then special summon 2 tokens with Dandylion's effect, activate Glow-Up Bulb from the GY, then Synchro summon T.G. Recipro Dragonfly. Once they're all on the field synchro summon 1 Stardust Sifr Divine Dragon.  &nbsp;  That's all that is packed in this deck. The rest of the cards are there for support, support meaning excessive drawing power using cards such as Graceful Charity, Pot Of Greed, Morphing Jar, Magical Mallet, Reload (x3).  &nbsp;  29/01/2022 edit:  Deck can be tuned to be tournament friendly by removing Graceful Charity and Pot Of Greed for Magical Mallet/Card Destruction/Card Trader (your choice).  Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon summon conditions (1 turn summon): you need Righty Driver, Double Summon and Angraecum Umbrella, plus one level 4* monster in your hand or GY. Activate Double Summon then normal summon Right Driver. Summon Lefty Driver using Right Driver's effect then once both are on the field Synchro summon Tatsunoko. Normal summon Angraecum Umbrella, activate its effect, pick a level 4* monster, special summon it, then synchro summon Clear Wing Synchro Dragon. Once Tatsunoko and Clear Wing Synchro Dragon are on the field, you can freely summon Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon. <h3 class=""LC20lb MBeuO DKV0Md""></h3>"

This is a beginner-friendly deck with o,"&nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>Utopia. </strong> That card was always a little 'out-there' as a viable deck that did anything other than make a guest spot on any Rank-4 Toolkit deck-list. But that all changes with the new structure deck!  But the most important aspect of this deck is coming to terms with the fact that playing Utopia as Yuma intended is.... Awful. Dododo etc are just... not great in a format where we constantly have to deal with negation effects. This deck<strong> NEEDED</strong> ways to set up XYZs plays without being so vulnerable. Enter 'Random-Jank I threw together so it's resistant to negation'.deck.   With cards like <a data-name=""Heroic Challenger-Assault Halberd "">Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd, Goblindbergh and Summoner Monk, this made the deck more responsive due to the support of the all new Zexal Server (ZS) monsters, ZS Ascend Sage and ZS Arms Sage!  Two powerful new monsters who can special summon themselves if you meet their requirements. (Instead of all that Dododo Gagaga normal summon stuff.)</a>  This deck is meant to streamline your way to victory using the Zexal Weapons (ZW) which are in your side deck to adapt to different matches so you can OTK easily using combos like Utopia Beyond! and ZW - Ashura Strike to reduce all opponent monster's attack values to 0 and attack multiple times!  Or just use the field spell to make King Overfiend with its proper material to lock the opponent out of monster effects so you can achieve game easier this way. You're a pure and simple beat stick deck and don't you forget it!  This has been UtopicJay &amp; don't forget to High-Five the Sky!  (Or 'Kattobingu' if you're weird.)  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck has a similar strategy as the 'AI_DarkMagician'-deck that is integrated as a bot in 'ProjectIgnis: EDOPro', but it works without <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> as the main difference. When you play with <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> you have to build the whole deck around it and your combo can get negated when this key-card gets destroyed. So this deck works with Graveyard-effects instead of summoning the dark magicians with <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> again, this means it has a lot more of combo-options and can adapt against every play-style. It has more power- and combo-potential but it has a bit slower build-up against 'OTK'-decks, then it would be better to play only one combo that works everytime in a deck.  <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>: It's part of the <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> combo and is a very fast special summon, that gives you a <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> to the hand, and has also a defensive effect for the battle phase.  <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a>: With this card you get <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> or <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> for free, but you only need one in the deck for 2 possible cards to search for.  <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>: It can get special summoned with the effect of <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> from the deck if you don't need <a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a>, and it gives all Spellcaster's a target-immunity. It also has a shoot-effect as a quick effect if you should need it.  <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a>: The only Fusion monster in the deck is <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, which has a strong draw-effect and you get <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> and <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> back when it gets destroyed. <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a> works with material from the Graveyard, so it's good to discard <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> and then instantly fusion-summon from the Graveyard. You can also do this with <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>, but the effect of <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a>, that you can special summon with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, can only put Monsters up to level 6 from the deck to the Graveyard.  <a data-name=""Palladium Oracle Mana"">Palladium Oracle Mana</a>: It has a destroy-Immunity for level 7 and higher Spellcasters which are <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>, <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>, and <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Haine"">Witchcrafter Haine</a>. It also has more special summon effects as a backup but it is a bit more random because you can not special summon it with <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> because it is a light-monster.  <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a>: It has a draw-effect that brings a Spellcaster to the Graveyard which works great in a Graveyard-deck, if you discard <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> or <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a>, you can also use it to fusion summon very fast from the Graveyard.  <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Armor&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Armor""</a>: World Legacy cards are a good side theme with Graveyard effects, you can put it to the Graveyard with <a data-name=""Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> and then special summon it to use it's special summon-effect and get another World Legacy Card. This way you can also get <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> to the hand which has a special summon-effect. The normal summon effect is more a backup-effect but it can be good against special summons.  <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a>: It'a World Legacy Card with a good special summon to synchro-summon or link summon it instantly. The normal-summon-negate-effect effect is again more a backup effect.  <a data-name=""Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight"">Girsu, The Orcust Mekk-Knight</a> – You can summon really fast <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> with it, and also bring another World-Legacy monster to the graveyard to special summon it.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> – You can special summon a second <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> and build <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> to special summon <a data-name=""Magical Hound"">Magical Hound</a> or <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>. If you special summon <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> with <a data-name=""Deep sea Diva"">Deep sea Diva</a> you can also special summon the second <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, this is important when you want to synchro-summon <a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a> with a level 6 monster.  <a data-name=""Deep Sea Artisan"">Deep Sea Artisan</a> – When it gets special summoned with a Graveyard-effect, with <a data-name=""One for one"">One for one</a> or <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a> you can special summon <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, or <a data-name=""Chocolate Magician Girl"">Chocolate Magician Girl</a> from the Graveyard. This is mostly good to have another 'token' for Synchro- or Link-summons.  <a data-name=""Magical Hound"">Magical Hound</a> – The best level 1-tuner to search with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> because when you link summon or snychro summon after you special sumoned it, you can special summon it again from the graveyard and put a face-up spell/trap to the hand. This can also be good with card destruction.  <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> – A good Token-card that is also level 1 to get it with <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>, and which is also a tuner to special summon it with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, you can often stall a round with it to play counter-cards more effectively or you can summon link-monsters.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a>, <a data-name=""Allure Of Darkness"">Allure Of Darkness</a>, <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>, <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> –  draw cards, <a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a> and <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> are good draw cards with Graveyard-effects. For <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a> you have 10 Spellcasters, without the fusion- and link-monsters, and for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> you have 12 Dark monsters. To use <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a> you can also play instant fusion and send <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> to the Graveyard, or you link-summon <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> with a 'level 1'-effect monster.  <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""One For One"">One For One</a> – Fast special summons to get <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> (spellcaster), link-summons or synchro-summons. <a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a> can also put a card to the Graveyard to special summon it then with another card.  <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a>, <a data-name=""Magicalized Fusion"">Magicalized Fusion</a>: <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> has a strong banish-effect, and it can bring you <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> or <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> to the hand, otherwise you can maybe still rearrange the next three cards to play then a draw-card.  <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>: Reborn-cards, you can get <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> with the effect of <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> or with special summoning <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Armor&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Armor""</a>.  &nbsp;  Traps:  <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a>, <a data-name=""Escape from the Dark Dimension"">Escape from the Dark Dimension</a>, <a data-name=""World Reassembly"">World Reassembly</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Landmark"">World Legacy Landmark</a> - Special-summon cards from the Graveyard, deck and banished cards. <a data-name=""World Legacy Landmark"">World Legacy Landmark</a> is a 'double-reborn' as a trap which works also good to link-summon in the opponent round with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> or <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a>.  <a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a> – Strong Special summon-card and then also a strong-negate card, because of all the other special-summon cards you should only need 1 of it.  <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>: Strong Negate-Card that works twice against special sumoned monsters. Most Special-summon-effects need 1-3 effects to trigger until you can special summon the 'boss-monster', so negates are often necessary.  &nbsp;  Extra Deck  Link-1:  <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> – it is used to get a spellcaster, for <a data-name=""Wonder Wand"">Wonder Wand</a>, to link-summon <a data-name=""Selene, Queen of The Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen of The Master Magicians</a>, or to fusion-summon <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a>.  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> – it is used to use the tokens for the link-summons.  Link-2:  <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> - you can get Instant Fusion for <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> which is also a spellcaster, or you can fusion summon with a spellcaster and a <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>/<a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> from the Graveyard.  <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> - It gives the link-monsters a 'destroy by card-effects-immunity' when you use it as material, you can also use it in the opponent round with the quick effect.  <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> - you can link summon it in a fast way with only one <a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>, or together with other special summon-cards. With the Banish-effect in the opponent's turn you can get <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> and then put <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> for a fusion summon to the graveyard, or <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> for <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> or another monster. When you put a 'level 6'-monster to the graveyard you get a 'level 1'-tuner that can instantly synchro-summon. With a level 6 monster on the field you can get <a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a>, and with a level 6- monster and another level-2 Tuner (<a data-name=""Deep Sea Diva"">Deep Sea Diva</a>), you get <a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a> to banish 3 monsters, you can also use a 'level 7'-monster and two 'level 1'-tuners. You must use 3 effects in a row for this in the opponment's turn, so you want to have a negate or a plan-b when you summon in this way.  <a data-name=""Lib the World Key Blademaster"">Lib the World Key Blademaster</a> – You can only link-summon it with <a data-name=""World Legacy Landmark"">World Legacy Landmark</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a>, <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Armor&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Armor""</a> or <a data-name=""World Legacy - &quot;World Crown&quot;"">World Legacy - ""World Crown""</a> in the graveyard. <a data-name=""World Reassembly"">World Reassembly</a> does not count as a 'World Legacy'-card, but it can special summon one. Then you can get <a data-name=""World Legacy Succession"">World Legacy Succession</a> from the deck and special summon one monster with it to link-summon again, this triggers the second effect that puts an opponent's card back to the deck.  Link-3:  <a data-name=""Selene, Queen Of The Master Magicians"">Selene, Queen Of The Master Magicians</a> – This card is used to have a reborn-effect for the Spellcaster-Monsters. You get one spell counter for every Spell on the field an in the graveyard, and it counts the spells of both players. With at least 3 spell counters you can special summon 1 Spellcaster from the graveyard and maybe use another combo-effect then with it.  Link-4:  <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow Of The Goddess</a> – You can summon it get a lot of negates that can be used more than one time in the opponent's turn, you can also use it later as a link-4-material to summon <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> if you get it back from the graveyard or if it survives.  <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> – It is good with link-4 and link-5 monsters because then it gets 6300 or 7300 atk, so you do not need a monster that has 'battle-damage'-immunity anymore. It also has a shoot-effect, needs only 2 monsters, and can be combo'd with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> to get a 'destroy by card-effects'-immunity.  Link-5:  <a data-name=""Underworld Goddess of the Closed World"">Underworld Goddess of the Closed World</a> – You can use one monster from the opponent as material, so you can outplay 'destroy'-immunities (but not 'target'-immunities) with it, it is also good with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> as a trap in the opponent's turn, you need 3 of your own monsters then and one has to be link-2. As secondary effects it has an 'activated-monster-effect'-immunity and a Graveyard-summon-negate, but it can be destroyed in battle.  Synchro:  <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> - You can summon it with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> or in another way. You can put one monster to the graveyard as a main effect, and then synchro-summon another monster.  <a data-name=""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"">Clear Wing Synchro Dragon</a> – A good monster with negate-effect, that is also easy to summon with a 'level 6'-monster and a 'level 1'-tuner.  <a data-name=""Crystron Quariongandrax"">Crystron Quariongandrax</a> – You can summon it after you used the effect of <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>, or later in the game when you can summon two tuners from the graveyard or the deck. You need one 'level 6' or 'level 7' card and two tuners to gel 'level 9' in total, then you can banish three monsters as a 'burst'-effect and get a banished monster back when it gets destroyed.  Fusion:  <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> - A target for <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> and a spellcaster.  <a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a> – A strong 'draw effect'-card, that gives you up to two monsters back when it gets destroyed that you can use for more combo's. It is easy to summon it when you put <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>/<a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> from the deck to the graveyard, with only two effect monsters then for <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>. With the draw-effect you can also directly set traps and use them if you draw a trap-card with it. You can draw one card in your turn and one in the opponent's turn, so it can become fast very effective."

The seventh Transformers movie has been given an official title. Gizmodo confirms that the film will be called ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"".  <a>https://fastandfurious9guias.wildapricot.org/</a>  It will be the first film in the successful, toy-based film series after 2018's ""Bumblebee"". The film will take place in 1994 and will be an adaptation of ""Beast Wars"". Some new robot characters will be introduced, including the villain Scourge. <a>https://fastandfurious9enfrancais.wildapricot.org/</a>  - One of the most important things we try to do with the film is to give the audience a lot of new. Our hope was to find new villains and priorities… If you have seen the other movies and like them, you will see villains you have never seen before. Autobots you've never seen, promised producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura during Thursday's press conference. <a>https://thesuicidesquadguid.wildapricot.org/</a>  We also know that shooting star Anthony Ramos takes the lead role as a former military man with a tech-crazy little brother. Ramos is most recently featured in the musicals ""Hamilton"" and ""In the Heights"", and is thus ready for his first starring role in a major action film. <a>https://thesuicidesquadenfrancais.wildapricot.org/</a>  - I watch classic movies like ""Indiana Jones"", where you go on an adventure but you also learn something along the way. Hopefully I can also shed light on the culture and the people, says the director.  <a>https://spacejam2guias.wildapricot.org/</a>"

Attempting to go turn 1 and stunning with Fossil Dyna on the opponents turn, while having a well built board. the most powerful board to end on is <span>Adamancipator Risen-Dragite, <span><span>Adamancipator Risen-Leonite, <span>I:P Masquerena, <span>Red- Eyes Dark Dragoon, <span>Predaplant Verte Anaconda, <span><span>and</span> Crystron Halqifibrax (EMZ)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>  So the most important thing about this combo is to be able to set up Koa'ki Meiru Guardian for prtection, Play through the Pran-kids combo. by having these ready to go you just continue extending with other cards like Koa'ki Meiru Supplier, Block Golem, Doki Doki, Madolche Petingcessoeur, and Parallel Ecxeed. just be mindful to capitalize on popping off Block Golem since its effect is easily abusable.  Its important to at least end on <span>Adamancipator Risen-Leonite,</span> <span>I:P Masquerena,</span> (<span>Adamancipator Risen-Dragite</span>/<span>Borreload Savage Dragon),</span> <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Crystron Halqifibrax (EMZ), </span></span></span></span></span></span></span>and any other card from the Extra Deck or Main Deck.  Now the stun part of the deck, on your opponents turn you can exhaust your opponents resources through your various negates, then banish <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Crystron Halqifibrax, <span> to synchro summon into <span>Shooting Riser Dragon<span> to then activae trigger effect on summon to send Fossil Dyna to the graveyard.

The decklist is not updated for the new Banlist so I already tell you not to join if that is,"I describe below why you should disregard the existence of the deck after limiting Misc.  Easy to use cards that automatically give you an advantage are the best cards in the game. This is the safest way to play a game like Yugioh, it's much better to make a simpler move, weaker but much more efficient than a much more powerful move that has several weaknesses. In this aspect my problem as a Dino player since Archosaur's arrival is the fact that the deck doesn't have much versatility, don't get me wrong it has excellent cards like Ovi, Misc, Lost World and Tyranno and excellent extra deck monsters having a power very big but there are no different follow ups and versatile plays like card recovery in GY. It has always been a frustrating deck to play compared to other goals that generate free resource and extend for no reason like Dragon Link was. And now with the hit on the banlist I don't recommend anyone to test the deck because it will just be a waste of time since the Misc dependency is not even a 2 card combo consistency issue (as if it's unfair to try to be consistent in making 2 card combo when most current meta decks do 1 combo card) and yes the fact that it is needed every turn as your follow up is like playing Invoked with 1 Aleister and the Aleister's effect is negated by a hand trap because the deck is cyclic and have to access the engine every turn to play (go through all the combo pieces and this is no longer possible). So it doesn't even make sense anymore to think that Dino will be a Rogue because it's a completely dead deck that goes all or nothing: either I can break field and OTK or I'm dependent on my established field not being broken or instantly forgiven for not having a play on my next turn and relying on a miraculous top draw that won't help me much anyway because what's the point of giving Oviraptor a draw if my play will be to add Tyranno and maybe I'll even make an xyz bringing Rex from turn, that is, what is missing is not Misc's stolen protection effect, but that from my next turn on, no move will be the least bit decent to have control of the game. And it's no use trying to return Misc with Omega or Nemeses. The following Lithium2300 video demonstrates everything I said about why the deck is dead when it plays twice against the Sky Striker deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPm0Xpuc1Kc.  So just accept that the Dinosaur type is forgotten in the game again waiting for a new archetype that I believe will not be made for years to come.  I apologize for not knowing how to write an article and having talked about the banlist in a deck profile but I really wanted to talk about it."

This means that they cannot be Special Summoned from the hand or Deck except by Ritual Summon and th,"Ritual Monsters (Japanese: 儀ぎ式しきモンスター Gishiki Monsutā), colored blue, are monsters that must normally be Special Summoned with a Ritual Spell Card. Examples include ""Magician of Black Chaos"", ""Demise, King of Armageddon"", and ""Nekroz of Trishula"".  Ritual Monsters are Special Summon-only monsters. This means that they cannot be Special Summoned from the hand or Deck except by Ritual Summon and the card ""Ritual Foregone"", and cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard or while banished unless they were first Ritual Summoned (even with a card like ""Fulfillment of the Contract"").  Ritual Summoning  Main article: Ritual Summon  <a>https://mccookbison.instructure.com/courses/10413/pages/123movies-watch-here-luca-2021-full-movie-online-free-hd-%7C-disney-pixar</a>  In some ways, Level 5 or higher Ritual Monsters can be easier to Summon than Normal or Effect Monsters of the same Level, since their Tributes do not need to be on the field. However, Ritual Monsters require a number of specific cards in the hand or field at once, which can be difficult to achieve. Some Ritual Spell Cards such as ""Advanced Ritual Art"" can ameliorate this by using monsters from the Main Deck instead, instead of using monsters from your hand/field. Searchers such as ""Preparation of Rites"" and ""Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands"" help to assemble the necessary components for a Ritual Summon, while support such as ""Ascending Soul"" and ""Ritual Buster"" help alleviate the costs of Ritual Summoning. The ""Djinn of Rituals"" series can serve dual purposes, as they make the Ritual Spell monster requirement easier to fulfill by banishing themselves from the Graveyard, and also grant an additional effect when used for the Ritual Summon of a Ritual Monster.  A card that allows Ritual Summoning does not always need to be a Ritual Spell card (but usually are). Examples include ""Secrets of Dark Magic"" and ""Conductor of Nephthys"" which are not Ritual Spell cards but have effects that include Ritual Summoning.  <a>https://mccookbison.instructure.com/courses/10413/pages/luca-2021-cz-dabing-videa-%7C-filmy-online-zdarma-hd</a>  Playing style  Because Ritual Monsters are not stored in the Extra Deck, it is usually necessary to have the Ritual Monster and its corresponding Ritual Spell in the hand before that monster can be Ritual Summoned. As a result, Decks focused on Ritual Summoning often include ways to search Ritual Monsters and Ritual Spells.  Some modern Ritual Monsters have effects which can be activated by discarding them from the hand, allowing them to function even when they cannot be Ritual Summoned. Some modern Ritual Spells allow Ritual Summoning from locations besides the hand (such as the Graveyard), or allow using monsters to meet the requirement from locations other than the player's hand or field.  <a>https://mccookbison.instructure.com/courses/10413/pages/123movies-%7C-luca-2021-full-movie-free-hd-%7C-watch-online</a>  Monsters that support Ritual Summoning can have effects including being treated as the entire requirement for a Ritual Summon, activating or applying their effects when used for a Ritual Summon, or granting an effect to the Ritual Summoned monster.  Ritual-reliant Decks benefit from having multiple copies of Ritual Spells and Ritual Monsters, as the chances of drawing both the Ritual Spell and the Ritual Monster increases greatly. Ritual Summoning can cost the player a large number of cards from their hand or field, so ways to generate hand advantage and recycle Ritual Spells are important.  In the anime  Ritual Monsters have not featured as a major mechanic in the anime.  In Yu-Gi-Oh, some prominent characters used Ritual Monsters, including Yugi Muto, Joey Wheeler, Seto Kaiba, Maximillion Pegasus, Dartz, and the Rare Hunters Umbra and Lumis.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Ritual Monsters occasionally appeared; Fusion Monsters were more prominently associated with the series. Alexis Rhodes used the first Ritual Monster-focused archetype; ""Cyber Angel"". Bastion Misawa, Titan, and Kaibaman all used a Ritual Monster.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, a single Ritual Monster appeared, used by Kite Tenjo.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V, Ritual Monsters were used by two characters, Alexis Rhodes and Aura Sentia, neither of whom were featured significantly.  In Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS, Ritual Summoning was the first non-Link Summon Special Summon method reintroduced in the series. Yusaku Fujiki and Theodore Hamilton used one Ritual Monster each, and Ai later used one of his own."

Do we really need it? And is it not like ten years too late?

Wombo Combo 1:  We use 1 copy of Guldefaxe because it is extremely easy to bring out Thor in this deck: Special summon 3 Ojamas by various methods i.e. Country, Obedience Schooled, Tri-wight etc. Summon Guldefaxe and Synchro Thor  Wombo Combo 2:  This combo is to forcefully activate waking the dragon. This is by no means reliable but if you manage to pull it off you're a boss. Special summon an Ojama (preferably Ojama Pink to activate its ability) to the middle monster zone, set waking the dragon to the spell/trap zone diagonal to the middle monster zone. Tribute your Ojama for Yajiro Invader. Activate creature swap and swap yajiro for any monster your opponent controls. Summon their card to anywhere on the board except for the colomn you set waking the dragon on and summon yajiro to the middle monster zone. Now just special summon another Ojama to the monster zone above waking the dragon and yajiro (now controlled by your opponent) will destroy waking the dragon, allowing you to summon anything you want i.e. Naturia Exterio, Ultimate Falcon etc. I came up with this combo primarily for Naturia Exterio since this deck lacks backrow destruction/management.  General info/ Tips: <ul>  	<li>This deck excels at swarming the field with monsters. If you play it right, you can end off with a Ojama Emperor, King, Knight and Apollousa in one turn. This end board pretty much locks your opponent out of playing the game unless they have a spell/trap card to get rid of our monsters. Which is why we have Wombo Combo 2 to bring out Exterio to deal with backrow.</li>  	<li>Ojama duo is an extremely powerful card but can easily backfire if used incorrectly. Unless you're sure your opponent cannot utilize the tokens, always activate your Ojama Duos during the end phase so they don't get a chance to use them for special summons. This allows you to utilize the second part of the effect immediately, since a turn has passed since it was sent to the graveyard.</li>  	<li>More often then not, you're going to be dumping your Ojamas into the graveyard like poop in your toilet after taco bell. Make sure you're sending the OG Ojamas first to make use of Tri-Wight to special summon all 3 from your GY.</li>  	<li>There are a ton of other good cards you can splash into this deck such as Ground Collapse, It is already a 50 card deck so i just put it in the side deck. Hand traps are also a welcome addition as well.</li>  	<li>Have fun! this is by no means a competitive deck, this deck is meant to piss your opponent off while you summon an army of speedo wearing gremlins and laugh maniacally as they can't do anything to stop you.</li> </ul> &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Spheres is strong and with a solemn or tidying in the back row it adds another negate/pop  Best starting combo line is to get out spheres and Sheou for a return and negate destroy  Going second  If you can combo off enough without interruption going into borrelsword should win you most games this deck produces enough most of the time to do that  If your opponent has interaction you can always default into spheres  If your feeling like a menace to society you can play through the negates with the dragonmaid combos and then verte into dragoon  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Though some of the cards may or may not be in the TCG GOAT Format, I see absolutely NO reason whatsoever why some of the GOAT cards from the GOAT OCG shouldn’t be in the already lackluster GOAT TCG in the first place. Also I made very gosh damned sure that these cards were viable for the age span of the GOAT Format and paid damn attention to the forbidden/limited list from the TCG GOAT version as carefully as possible.  I also wanna point out that this is my first, GOAT Format WATER Deck… EVER… so any constructive feedback is welcome."

The Fleur Synchro can be replaced by any level 10 Synchro that requires 1 tuner and 1 non-tuner, such as Leo or Ruddy Rose Dragon.  A single Scrap Raptor in the hand often leads to full combo if done right, however, with Scrap Factory also on the field, you can go into even crazier plays.

An awesome day, a very good day indeed. Sky striker mobilize: engage is back to game to make some storms. Sky striker is the first deck that I made a guide for explain every detail, and is one of my favorite decks of all time. School girls and mech suit?!

Of course not , not even close to a tier 2 I believe , but this deck is a pandora box in yu-gi-oh! History. The future will tell us if this action of konami was good or not, but for now I’ll relax and play with my favorite deck. Does this deck deserves the hate? Definitely not!!  I hope you enjoy it my little guide, any doubt or ways to improve it, just comment!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Hordes of Demons, Superpowerful Dragons, Masters of Arcane Arts,  &nbsp;  Or a single girl in a mech suit?  &nbsp;  I’d put my money on the girl with the mech suit, because her favourite tool Engage, is back to 1!  &nbsp;  The unban of Engage! is absolutely bonkers for Striker, increasing it’s power <strong>exponentially</strong>. It enables more consistency, an improved grind game, and a search with +1 every turn!  Sky Striker can be <strong>splashed in every deck now as an engine again</strong> with minimal investment. It generally consists of 1 Engage/1 Hornet Drones/1 Widow in the maindeck and 1 Kagari/1 Hayate/1 Zeke in the extradeck, rewarding the player a free link-2 without using up normal summon, a quick effect negate/change of heart with widow anchor, and a “better pot of greed” with Engage! (Seriously Konami what are you thinking lmao). Anyways, on to the deck (it’s a redo of another deck I made a couple months back):  &nbsp;  This deck is the usual Sky Striker's deck, but with an unusual twist - less control/lockdown cards (I refuse to play mystic mine) in favour of cards that blow up the opponent's board. The philosophy with this deck is to destroy most if not all of your opponent's resources that they slap down on the board going first, and then close out the match with Sky Striker's unparalleled grind game. NOW WITH ENGAGE!  &nbsp;  The deck features 3 card types, Going Second Cards, the Generic Staples and the Sky Striker Core:  &nbsp;  <strong>7 Going-Second Cards, the board breakers!</strong>  &nbsp;  2 Lightning Storm - The most expensive card in the deck (About $100 each as of this writing, reprints soon I hope!) it is incredibly powerful. It can wipe either backrow or monsters given the player using it doesn't have face-up cards. This is useful going second, but can become a brick mid/late game, that’s why there are only 2. This card can be replaced by a cheaper alternative like Twin Twisters or Dark Ruler No More.  &nbsp;  3 Evenly Matched - One of the most potent board killers out there, it's non-targeting/destroying removal can out most boards if allowed to activate. Just skip to the end of your battlephase as you go second, and watch your opponent's carefully crafted board that they've spent 10 minutes building disappear into the Shadow Realm.  &nbsp;  1 Raigeki - No explanation needed, smash your opponent's monsters!  &nbsp;  1 Feather Duster - No explanation needed, obliterate your opponent's backrow! This is especially useful during this meta as it is dominated by control cards in the backrow, like Dogmatika Punishment, Ice Dragon's Prison, and Torrential Tribute.  &nbsp;  <strong>17 Generic Staples</strong>  3 Pot of Desires – I know some people are reluctant to run Pot of Desires in their deck, but resources are absolutely essential to Sky Striker’s win-condition of coming out on top of the grind game after breaking the board. Try to tutor out your important one-ofs in your deck before you use this, like Multirole and Engage because of either or both of these are banished, the power level of your deck goes down dramatically.  &nbsp;  2 Pot of Avarice – This card is for resource recycling especially of your Sky Striker link monsters, especially because you burn through a lot of them. This card is a easy +2 because it's conditions of shuffling 5 monsters back into the deck from the GY is so effortless to do in Sky Strikers. Since this card's unban, I've chosen to take out Sky Striker's own resource recycling card Hercules Base because I feel this card is superior even though it's unsearchable. Feel free to bump this card to 3, and maybe take out the Upstart Goblin. This card may be a bit bricky/sticky sometimes though, so be careful.  &nbsp;  1 Upstart Goblin to put a free spell in your GY strengthening your Striker Link monsters as well as a relatively free +1 draw. It may give your opponent +1000 lifepoints, but arguably in most cases lifepoints don't matter if your opponent has few resources left after you whittle them down with your Sky Striker cards and board equalizers.  &nbsp;  1 Terraforming to allow for easy access to Area Zero.  &nbsp;  1 Called by the Grave to out those pesky ghost girl hand traps or banish that old annoying Eldlich dude being a creep in the GY.  &nbsp;  1 Reinforcement of the Army to search for Sky Striker Raye to allow more consistent access to Striker link monsters.  &nbsp;  3 Triple Tactics Talent is optimal because of the sheer power and utility of this card. This card will almost always be live, because in a going-second build of Sky Strikers you will bait negates which are often monster effects, and that’s when this card will make it’s move. For example, after throwing down a Lightning Storm and having it negated with your enemy’s Dragoon, you can use this card to steal their Dragoon and pop two monsters + burn! Also, if you get handtrapped, this card can always give you a +2 to possibly get you out of your sticky situation with more cards.  1 Monster Reborn is self-explanatory. Incredible all-purpose extender.  3 Ash Blossom is essential in the 1 for 1 resource war Sky Striker excels at.  1 Dinowrestler Pankratops is great for breaking boards and getting rid of pesky backrow that your spellcards can’t get rid of, like Imperial Order. It also has 2600 atk, so it can get over a 3 negate Apollousa.  &nbsp;  <strong>15 Sky Striker Cards</strong>  &nbsp;  Everyone knows what these cards do already, so I'll just explain why I picked the ratios for each card. 3 Raye (obviously) and 1 Roze. 1 Roze is fine because she is easily dumped into the GY with Hayate and can be searched through the newly unbanned Engage. 3 Airspace Area Zero and 1 Hornet Drones are also added to allow for maximum access to the Striker links.  &nbsp;  1 Engage does so much for the deck – exponentially increasing the power of Sky Strikers. Arguably the most broken card ever to be released in Yugioh, Engage is a better pot of greed since it allows you to choose the first card you draw and you still get the second card with minimal set-up in the graveyard. This card can be used repeatedly through the recycling of Kagari and Multirole.  &nbsp;  1 Multirole for resource recycling of Sky Striker Spells. Whatever you do, DO NOT let this card get banished by something like cosmic cyclone, if it does, that represents about half the grind game power of Sky Strikers down the drain. Ideally, after you equalize the gamestate in turn 2, you search this card with your first Shizuku at the endstep to initiate your grindgame for turn 3.  &nbsp;  3 Widow Anchor is to maximize your ability for fieldwide control of your opponent's cards and to disrupt plays. I only added one Shark Cannon because I find that other cards are more useful. However, if you come across a deck that uses a lot of monsters in the GY (such as Eldlich) feel free to swap out other cards for Shark Cannon to control the graveyard.  &nbsp;  2 Afterburners are in this deck because it is an excellent board breaking card that can easily bait out negates, preparing for your truly devastating board-breakers. For example, bait out their one spell/trap negate by targeting their Borreload Savage, then proceed to slap down Evenly Matched and watch their entire board EXPLODE! This card can also destroy an active Area Zero if it's already on your field, giving you another Sky Striker monster on the board. Against backrow decks, feel free to swap a copy of this card out for Jamming Waves! to destroy their face down cards.  &nbsp;  <strong>For the Extra Deck, we have</strong>  &nbsp;  11 Sky Striker link monsters - 3 Kagari (spell recovery from GY), 3 Hayate (direct attack + dump Striker card to GY), 3 Shizuku (Free search and endphase), 1 Kaina (stop opponent's monster's attack), and 1 Zeke (Primarily to link away your oppenent's monster you gained control over and to banish an opponent's monster on board).  &nbsp;  1 Hiita the Fire Charmer because it also allow access to Selene by stealing your opponent's used Ash Blossom, Almiraj or any other fire monster that is running around in the meta nowadays. Hiita is easily able to be made by first going into Kagari, the fire attribute Sky Striker and linking it away.  &nbsp;  1 Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior is a common out (since it is non-targeting/destroying removal) to hard to kill towers monsters like Dragoon. A favourite play I do (after baiting out Dragoon’s negate) is to steal the Verte Anaconda used to summon Dragoon and link it away with my Striker link-1, then send Dragoon to the GY!  &nbsp;  1 Knightmare Unicorn to shuffle back your opponent’s card. It’s also the easiest way to link climb to Accesscode talker and give it 5300 atk with it’s link-3 rating.  &nbsp;  1 Accesscode is used to smash your opponent with a slam dunk after you’ve sufficiently tenderized their rock solid defense and depleted their resources. After getting their LP below 5300, push for game with Accesscode Talker with 4+ pops since the GY is packed with different attribute striker links! This badass will be the last thing many opponents see before dropping to 0 LP.  &nbsp;  Additional Commentary  &nbsp;  Weaknesses - This deck is very strong, and it can consistently contend vs. the strongest decks of any era of Yugioh (so far), especially since the unban of Engage! to 1. However, this deck autoloses vs. anti-spell floodgates such as Secret Village of Spellcasters and Imperial Order. A deck that uses both of these cards is very difficult to beat (I'm looking at you, Altergeists &gt;:c)  Monster cards that are untargetable/undestroyable/unaffect are very difficult for this deck to get rid of as well, such as the commonly seen Red Eyes Dragoon and The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister. These cards are specifically why I side kaijus like Gadarla to use in match-ups where these cards are common.  Finally, there are some decks that actually still recover quite competently after you wipe their board and can counter-attack your fragile board with strong gigantic monsters for an OTK. Watch-out for these games, and try to force a grind-game where you're several steps ahead to avoid this situation.  &nbsp;  As a machine player that loves to play aggressively in dynamic interesting back/forth games, I absolutely LOOOOVE this deck. Methodically cracking an established “impregnable” board and going for 1 for 1 trades until you win out feels incredible satisfying. It's super fun wiping your opponent's carefully crafted board, then having your favourite pretty mech girl destroy monster after monster like the Doomslayer. Hope you folks have as much fun playing this deck as I do, even though Sky Strikers technically are not meta anymore. Engage and Afterburners to pierce the heavens!

CASSER. Déchaînés est un deck entièrement basé sur la destruction de carte. Le deck a une (ré)génération de ressource énorme, puisque absolument toutes les cartes Déchaînés invoque un monstre de l'archétype quand elle sont détruites. Cela permet de puissant combo mpliquant de détruire ses propres cartes pour en invoqué encore plus. Cette version du deck est plutôt prévue pour commencer, mais les effets de destruction lui permettent aussi de se débrouiller en deuxième.</p>  <h2>Cartes clés</h2> <p class=""Textbody""></p> <p class=""Textbody""><u>Areha/Rakuha</u> : Les starters du deck, ils permettent de détruire les cartes piègespour lancer les combos, soit en invoquant <b>Sarama</b>, qui va permettre de continuer à combo, soit les plus gros monstres qui vont gêner l'adversaire.<u></u></p> <p class=""Textbody""><u>Les Links, Rage, Angoisse et Abomination</u> : L'autre objectif du deck est de grimper dans les niveaux de Links, <b>Rage</b> et <b>Angoisse</b> peuvent absorber les monstres de l'adversaire pour invoquer de plus gros monstres Links (Rage peut absorber pendant le tour de l'adversaire et est donc un objectif à atteindre quand on joue en premier). Les cibles principales sont <b>Abomination</b> (pour détruire petit à petit) et <b>Dragon Bombe Topologique</b> (pour un gros nettoyage de plateau)  <u>Guide touristique/Esprits sombre </u>: Al'aide de Guide Touristique en main de départ, vous pouvez mettre au cimetière vos deux Esprits Sombre (Bannissement et Malice). Ces monstres entraînent un boucle de ressource avec vos Déchaînés lvl 8. Pour ce faire, invoquez normalement Guide touristique, invoquez un Esprit Sombre, Invoquez Cherubini de votre Extra deck, utilisez Cherubini pour envoyer l'autre esprit au cimetière. Plus tard dans le tour, si vous arrivez à invoquez un Déchaînés lvl 8, utilisez pour faire un Link ou détruisez-le, ce qui vous permettra de reprendre les deux esprits sombres en main. Pendant le tour de l'adversaire, vous pourrez commencer à ramener vos lvl 8 avec les esprits, puis récupérer vos esprits quand le lvl 8 quitte de nouveau le terrain.</p>  <h2>Tips/Limitations</h2> <p class=""Textbody""></p> <p class=""Textbody"">Les monstres de départ Déchaînés forcent à invoquer des démons, bloquant certaines options pendant le tour (<b>Phantom Knight, Dragon Bombe Topologique, Cherubini</b>)  <b>Ame déchaînée de l'angoisse </b>et <b>Ame déchaînée du désastre </b>n'ont pas d'effets rapide, ils sont donc plus intéressant à utiliser à partir du tour 2/3. Si vous avez déjà <b>Désastre</b> au cimetière, vous pouvez le ramener avec une<b> Chambre Abominable</b>.  Si vous commencez avec un monstre <b>Artéfact</b> en main de départ, vous pouvez les détruire avec vos propres effets pendant le tour adverse pour activer leurs effets.<b><u></u></b></p>"

Can probably perform pretty well against stuff that isn't meta, but I don't play competitively so maybe there's someone better than me that can look at this  and gimme 50 reasons to fix it.  &nbsp;  edit: changed my mind cant be fucked to fix it just update the cards yourself if smthn is limited or whatever  &nbsp;  Main gameplan here is to get to go first, then play Trickstar Candina and Lycoris out here, then hit them with a trickstar reincarnation on the enemy draw phase. If used with lightstage you're looking at like a 4th of their total hp and it banishes their first hand which is usually the biggest one imo. The amazement cards are here just because I like the archetype and I feel that trickstars does need some sort of real presence on the field, so Arlekino can serve as that very capable beatstick."
