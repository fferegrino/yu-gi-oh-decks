This is fundamental and why the Lock strategy now does works because before the Deck was not able to surpass Monsters with more than 2500 ATK as easily as now

ABC Guardragon Sekka's Light Turbo (Going First) (With Combos and Tutorial),"After testing this hypothesis of mine 2 weeks ago that the Danger engine would work super well with the ABC pieces, I realized it was a real combination that actually works really well together. Then I realized well if this works then why not combine the Guardragon engine and just make the deck broken? So I did that, and this is the end result. A deck that can, if uninterrupted, end on 2 negates, and 2 or 3 interruptions, plus ripping a card out of your opponent's hand. And the deck is super consistent, I made sure that after testing that this deck could be a competitive deck in the meta if you chose to play it for real just like I do for most of my other decks. This idea from scratch I have come up with has just performed so well in testing and I figured I'd share this special deck with you all! I will have a link to downloadable replays I uploaded to mediafire which contains the replays from ygopro of the full detailed combos for this deck. Just click the link, download the replay, put the .yrp file into your ygopro replays folder in your applications. Then launch ygopro and watch the replays! Anyways, the goal of the deck is to go first. For the main combo, first summon a couple of Dangers. 2 or 3 will be enough. You should have at least one ABC piece in your hand so normal summon it and link it and another Danger off to go into <a data-name=""Reprodocus"">Reprodocus</a> and activate the ABC piece you sent to the graveyard. Then activate Reprodocus to make the monster you left below it dinosaur so you can go into <a data-name=""Summon Sorceress"">Summon Sorceress</a>. After that, you need to special summon a dragon monster from your hand or graveyard somehow, like using <a data-name=""Defrag Dragon"">Defrag Dragon</a> or some sort of dragon extender in the deck. If possible you should avoid using the White Dragon and Black Dragon because they can be abused at the end of the combo to repeat the <a data-name=""Eclipse Wyvern"">Eclipse Wyvern</a> combo using <a data-name=""Guardragon Pisty"">Guardragon Pisty</a> and add a second Chaos Dragon from your deck to hand. After you summon a dragon monster you want to use Summon Sorc 's effect to target that dragon monster and summon Eclipse Wyvern from your deck, and use that dragon plus Summon Sorc to go into <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> then use the Eclipse Wyvern to go into <a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a>. Use Eclipse Wyvern's effect to banish <a data-name=""Chaos Dragon Levianeer"">Chaos Dragon Levianeer</a> for later. Use Elpy to special summon Destrudo from your deck to the field. At this point you need another dragon monster on the field or any monster in general. So using the White Dragon or Black Dragon is important here because you need to use the Black Dragon to banish the Eclipse Wyvern in grave to get back the Chaos Dragon you banished off it's effect. After you get another dragon onto the field or had another monster from before, use Destrudo and Saryuja to go into <a data-name=""Guardragon Agarpain"">Guardragon Agarpain</a> and you can use it's effect to special summon <a data-name=""Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss"">Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss</a> directly from the extra deck. Then use Agarpain, Elpy, and the other dragon monster you had to go into Saryuja. At this point you've done the Guardragon combo, there's so much more you can do at this point but its too much to further explain. Please refer to the replays I have provided down below to help answer your questions about the combos and such.

I'll list out all uses and combinations to other cards here: <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a>: This is the soul of the deck. It's able to be Ritual Summon by all Ritual Spell of the deck: <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a>, with <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> in the GY or monsters with total Level equal to 7, <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Ar"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> with a Dark Magician in the Deck and <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>, with any combination of monsters with Level exceed or equal to 7. Moreover, due to the fact that it is a Dark Magician while on the field or in the GY, so <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> will be the most effective way to pull it back from the GY. When you activate a Spell/Trap card or effect, you can pop 1 card on the field, which means it can also be destructive, but it can also destroy <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> for its effect, or, if you are good enough to use this, after attacking, activate a Spell/Trap or effect to destroy your own Eternal Soul to Special Summon another Magician of Chaos, or if you have, Special Summon <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> for intense damage. Don't forget that it can also interact with <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a> for banishing or for Impcantation monsters.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>: Nothing much to say about this guy. Fuel for Eternal Soul and Dark Magical Circle at the start of the game and to use as Material for <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a> or <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a>: The main searcher of the deck. It can search for <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> or <a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a>, as usual, but it can also go for <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a> since Chaos Form does list ""Dark Magician"" in its text. Moreover, its second effect helps us to recover it, only by Tributing 1 Spellcaster-type monster. You can Tribute <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> (if you've used its effect, that's better) to return it to your hand, then activate Eternal Soul to resurrect it. Dark Magical Circle will banish a card and Magician of Chaos will also destroy one.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a>: Most of the time we will be using its first effect. You would reveal it and discard 1 card to Special Summon 1 Impcantation monster from the Deck, activates its effect for a Ritual Spell/Ritual Monster in the GY/from the Deck. You can Ritual Summon it for its second effect to destroy an extra card.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a>: You can reveal 1 Ritual Spell in your hand for its effect, so it can combine with <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a> for <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a> to activate its effect. Special Summon another Impcantation monster for Deck effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a>: Combine with <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a> to Special Summon it and an Impcantation monster for its Deck effect.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Bookstone"">Impcantation Bookstone</a>: Similar to <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a>. (Fact: It is Spellcaster-type, so Magician's Rod can also Tribute it for recovery.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Pensilver"">Impcantation Pensilver</a>: Similar to <a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a>: You can Special Summon it with <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> or Ritual Summon it. You can use Impcantation Inception or Chaos Form, but note that Chaos Form needs the exact Level, so combinations are 2 <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> or <a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a> / <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> / <a data-name=""Impcantation Bookstone"">Impcantation Bookstone</a> + <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a> / <a data-name=""Impcantation Pensilver"">Impcantation Pensilver</a>. (You cannot use <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a> because it requires Normal Monster in the deck, but we only have <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a>s.)</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Artifact Scythe"">Artifact Scythe</a>: Simple. Set it as Spell to be destroyed (either by your opponent or <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a>) or Special Summon it from the Deck with <a data-name=""Artifact Sanctum"">Artifact Sanctum</a>. When you finish it, for the rest of that turn, your opponent Extra Deck is locked.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>: Tribute it from the hand to prevent your opponent from banishing cards. You can also use <a data-name=""Artifact Sanctum"">Artifact Sanctum</a> then Tribute it from the field. Unless you have only a bit of monster(s), don't Set it because they might banish it or use <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> to lock your Lancea.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a>: Use it to search cards and alter your first 3 cards. In addition, combine with <a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a> and <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> is a good way to banish cards every turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a>: Use it to Ritual Summon <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> or <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a>. You can get it again or search it by <a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>, <a data-name=""Impcantation Bookstone"">Impcantation Bookstone</a>, <a data-name=""Impcantation Candoll"">Impcantation Candoll</a> and <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a>: For Ritual Summoning <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a> or <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a>. You can have it in your hand just like with <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a>, but you cannot add it by <a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a>. But, it's the best card at the start of the game because it only needs <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a> in the Deck.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Preparation of Rites"">Preparation of Rites</a>: Ironically, when you play 3 copies of this card, you are playing 6 <a data-name=""Magician of Chaos"">Magician of Chaos</a>, 4 <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a>, 4 <a data-name=""Chaos Form"">Chaos Form</a>, 6 <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a>, and 4 <a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>. This card doesn't only have the searching ability but also the recovering ability.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Impcantation Inception"">Impcantation Inception</a>: An alternative card to <a data-name=""Advanced Ritual Art"">Advanced Ritual Art</a>, but it can Summon <a data-name=""Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon"">Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</a> and don't have to be the correct Level. But it cannot have Materials from the Deck, and since it has the self-recovery ability, we will only play 1.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>: Nothing to say. It's a staple that acts as Pot of Greed for decks that don't use the Extra Deck. Its only drawback is that it can only be activated at the start of Main Phase 1, greatly reduce this card power.

The deck is also capable of some explosive OTKs under the right circumstances, either with Bravo bumping up a full board, or the deck being very competent at making large link monsters such as Borrelsword Dragon. The deck's biggest weakness is, like many lower tier decks, disruption. A full playset of called by the grave and a copy of Millenium-Eyes Restrict in the extra deck to be summoned with Instant Fusion are basically mandatory to play the deck, and depending on how often you find yourself dealing with Evenly Matched and Infinite Impermanence, a playset of Red Reboot is a very good sidedeck option.  &nbsp;  Edit: Gonna add a small addendum to here to explain some of the weirder card choices as it now occurs to me that some of these things in the deck might not make much sense without proper context.  Instant Fusion and it's targets in the extra deck are there for a few main purposes, helping mitigate the deck's weakness to handtraps, provide materials for Folgo without conflicting with the main monster types of the deck and preventing special summons, and opening up a small synchro engine. Millenium Eyes is being ran over ol' Thousand Eyes purely because the deck has other capable options for removing problematic monsters, and ensuring that you can kickstart your deck's main engine in the form of Folgo is much more important than the removal Thousand Eyes provides. If you still desire Thousand Eyes in the decklist, my recommendation is to remove a copy of Sea Monster of Theseus rather than Millenium Eyes.  Second is One For One, and Linkuriboh. The simple answer to their inclusion is that Linkuriboh can swap in for your Restrict so he doesn't lock off Folgo's ability to summon a Spellcaster type Fur Hires from the deck, specifically Wiz, and Linkuriboh in the graveyard can add an extra splash of potential protection involving Philo, Messenger Fur Hire. I <em>cannot</em> stress enough how incredible Philo is for the deck, enough so that she basically necessitates One For One with how much advantage she can generate you. She's a hilariously strong play extender, and the deck's best comeback tool in longer games. If any changes are going to be made to the overall decklist, it'll likely be me finally falling to temptation and slapping in a copy of Foolish Burial to ensure she has a target to revive from the graveyard. Always run her at 3, and never any less.  To put the 10 card side deck into context for people, the two main serious side deck options are Dyna, as he's a great way of clearing out the GY against decks that heavily rely upon it, but is otherwise pretty useless. I recommend swapping out the lone copy of Sagitta should you need to include him. And Red Reboot, which as stated above is to prevent Infinite Impermanence from ruining your day. The Lullaby of Obedience and Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell are a more personal thing, and are simply there because eventually you'll get tired of getting stomped on by Sky Strikers, and both are very strong tech cards to run against them specifically."

The deck went off the grid for a while ever since it won it's first YCS and still is in the dark but can easily top on a regional level or even YCS if played properly without misplays. The goal of the deck is to go first and stun your opponent so that they can't play and slowly drain their life points by spamming <a data-name=""Altergeist Multifaker"">Altergeist Multifaker</a> and <a data-name=""Altergeist Sliquitous"">Altergeist Sliquitous</a>. A spicy tech I added to the deck is <a data-name=""Witch of the Black Forest"">Witch of the Black Forest</a> because she is another way to search off Multifaker during your Main Phase 2 if you choose to go into Clara &amp; Ruska using Witch as link material. Although her effect says that the monster you add from your deck to hand cannot be used that turn, it does not matter because you use Multifaker mainly during your opponents turn. Shes also a card you can just set going first and when it gets destroyed you can search any Altergeist for your upcoming turn or to shuffle back into the deck using <a data-name=""Personal Spoofing"">Personal Spoofing</a> to add Multifaker and have Multifaker's effect go off. I hope you guys enjoy the deck and the spice! Stick around for more soon."

In my opinion, this version is more versatile than my Blue Eyes version, since the Guardragons require levels 4 or less, except Agarpain. This deck also contains more ways of easier special summoning, but the way to use it is similar to my Blue Eyes version. The new spicy dragon in the deck is Defrag Dragon since you can special summon it for free by discarding a monster. Take note that you can only special summon him this way once."

Besides a slight consistency issue, the deck is pretty good at going first and second, and can usually put up a board that can both survive your opponents turn and survive a war of attrition. The deck can struggle at putting up enough damage for game (thus giving your opponent another turn) and the lack of extra deck space means getting over something that can't be destroyed can be an issue.  &nbsp;  Overall, the deck is pretty fun to play, and it makes for a viable rogue deck that, if more solid support of Earth-Machines comes out, could be even more viable.  &nbsp;  Like or comment if you'd like me to build a version with Trains as I think that deck could have a lot of potential as well.  &nbsp;  Also, The build your own side-deck, the cards I have in now are just ones I experimented with."

True Draco has been a deck that's always been sticking around as a relevant deck ever since its introduction in 2016 having been at the top of the metagame for some time as well. Despite the introduction of link format and the banning of Master Peace, limiting Return of the True King to 1, and now Dinomight Knight the True Dracofighter limited at 1, the deck has shown promise as an avid, control-based rogue deck that can utilize floodgates to perhaps their maximum potential.  Though I didn't play True Draco during their prime, I did pick up the deck in 2018 and decided to play around with it for a while. After working with the variants that exist (which I will post later), I have found that this variant of the deck has been the most flexible with the diversity of the format in mind and general strategy of most decks which currently dominate the metagame. <h2>Strategy</h2> <em>Note: I won't go over specific ratios as I think it's more worth the time to discuss the general strategy and theory behind the deck. If there are questions about ratios, then please go to the comments section and I will gladly answer!</em>  First, a bit of theory on why I think playing blind second is strategic in the February 2019 format. If we look at the decks which have been performing at the top of the metagame, you have the following four decks consistently showing results: Sky Striker, Danger! Thunder Dragon, Salamangreat, and Danger! Orcust. If you lose the coin flip, it's generally going to be the case that they'll go first in which you are forced to go second, thus having this version of the deck is useful then. Now let's say you win the coin flip, the problem is that decks like Danger! Thunder Dragon and Sky Striker are fully capable of breaking apart your board to a large degree. Considering that you don't know what your opponent is playing until game 1 starts, it's better to just start off going second so you can know what your opponent plays and have a good chance of being able to respond using the cards in your deck designed for going second.  The above theory works especially well with True Draco which is by nature able to break boards using the graveyard effects of the continuous spells and traps within the archetype. Not to mention, using the floodgates allows the deck to further simplify the game state. <a data-name=""There Can Be Only One"">There Can Be Only One</a> is great vs every deck you would worry about except Sky Striker for which you can already utilize True Draco's natural ability to break apart the board along with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>. The key strategy with this deck lies in using the going second options you have, such as <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> to slow down your opponent along with Evenly Matched to break their board apart or bait out a negate, in order to effectively allow for you to effectively turn the pace of the game to your favor.  Since Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries is used, it can be guessed that most of the cards in the Extra Deck are targets for Cherries. The only exceptions are <a data-name=""Number 61: Volcasaurus"">Number 61: Volcasaurus</a><a data-name=""Number 61: Volcasaurus"">, </a>which is there due to its utility in helping to either end the game or be used to win with the new time rules, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Violet Chimera"">Salamangreat Violet Chimera</a> which is a target for <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> which is also a target for Super Polymerization, and <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a> which is just useful generic utility.  <span>The side deck is designed to help you in future games with certain cards being preferable for going first and others for going second. There is more of a focus on going 2nd cards mainly to capitalize on the fact that you have a game 3 which you can come back from in the case you need to go that far since the opponent is likely to force you to go second if you win game 1, then they lose game 2. In case you lose game 1 and you win game 2, then they’ll again most likely force you to go second again due to the nature of their deck hence making this the best strategy.</span> <h2>Matchups</h2> I will be primarily focusing on the following matchups: Sky Striker, Salamangreat, Danger! Thunder Dragon, and Danger! Orcust. If there are any other matchups that you, the reader, are curious about please feel free to ask about it in the comments section. <ul>  	<li><strong>Sky Striker</strong>: This matchup is overall more on the difficult side especially when put in the position of going first unless you gain access to the necessary cards. When going in blind second as you can use Cherries to banish <a data-name=""Sky Striker Ace - Kagari"">Sky Striker Ace - Kagari</a> and or Shizuku (if you happen to have multiple Cherries) which then you can follow up with Evenly Matched or use the natural board breaking abilities of True Draco. However, when going second, it is risky to play a long game vs Striker due to cards such as <a data-name=""Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburner"">Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!</a> which pose quite a threat. Going into future games, it is highly recommended that the player side in all three copies of <a data-name=""Anti-Spell Fragrance"">Anti-Spell Fragrance</a> to work with <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> and side out Super Polymerization along with There Can Be Only One which will greatly help with this matchup. If desired, <a data-name=""Wiretap"">Wiretap</a> could also be sided in for future games to avoid Evenly Matched or maybe <a data-name=""Inspector Boarder"">Inspector Boarder</a> to potentially slow down the opponent's plays.</li>  	<li><strong>Salamangreat</strong>: This matchup is overall pretty easy due to the natural board-breaking ability that True Draco has along with their comfort playing floodgates like There Can Be Only One which cripples Salamangreat significantly. In future games, depending on how the Salamangreat player tends to play as observed from game 1, it may be recommended that <a data-name=""The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode"">The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode</a> is sided in for future games if you anticipate that you will go second again. Playing the third copy of There Can Be Only One would be highly recommended for future games while siding out Imperial Order in exchange.</li>  	<li><strong>Danger! Thunder Dragon</strong>: This is arguably the most difficult matchup due to <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a> posing such a huge threat to True Draco, not to mention the sheer amount of negations which are usually set up. When going in blind second, it's recommended that Cherries is used for <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> in order to heavily restrict the ability of the opponent to extend their play to their full potential. However, if desired and depending on the situation, the player may prefer to pick Thunder Dragon Colossus or <a data-name=""Guardragon Elpy"">Guardragon Elpy</a> as the Cherries target instead. Following up with Evenly Matched or Super Polymerization would then be best while setting up There Can Be Only One. Cards such as The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode, <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a>, Inspector Boarder, and the third copy of There Can Be Only One should be sided in to help with this matchup in future games.</li>  	<li><strong>Danger! Orcust</strong>: This matchup is rather easy and True Draco has practically little to no problem with this matchup due to the natural board-breaking ability of True Draco, not to mention Azathot not being an issue to worry about. To help secure the match victory, it is recommended that the player side in Artifact Lancea and side out Imperial Order.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> This is a fun while competitive deck to play in this current format which is full of Salamangreat, Sky Striker, and Danger! Thunder Dragon. I encourage players to at least consider picking up True Dracos for the February 2019 format! If there are any questions about card ratios or strategy, please ask in the comments section and I will reply!"

The link was...nice, but not nearly what they needed.  &nbsp;  The deck aims to control your opponent. You really want to go first. Get your transformation, and go into Goliath or Aether. Your other cards either get you to that goal or help to slow them down. The deck is ok on consistency, but really struggles if your opponent has main deck destruction/negation.  &nbsp;  Play around with it. It is pretty fun. New support could make this deck pretty viable.  &nbsp;  Make your own side deck. Any suggestions for the deck is greatly appreciated."

No body runs S/Ts that can pop field spells anymore, so this will catch so many decks off guard. However, if you do run into that one weirdo that is playing MST at 3, cards like dark bribe, and more importantly  field barrier can aid you in assuring your victory. The rest of the cards in this deck either help you draw some (Balance of Judgment) or mill your opponent's cards (Present card).  I can't tell you how many names I've been called for using this deck strategy. If you love trolling too, this deck is for you!  &nbsp;"

Infernoids are great from disruption as they don't only negate they also banish the opponents cards and use opponents cards for the required tributes (through the use of lair of darkness). There are cards to bounce cards to owners hand, banish from field or destroy the spells and traps.  The boss monsters of the deck can special summon themselves from the hand or grave and each can either wipe all monsters or all back row and each have  very healthy base stats.  Void feast is a centre piece of this deck allowing for the special summoning up to three infernoids permitting that their levels equal 8, meaning that you can special summon cards with negation in your opponents turn as you see fit.  Infernoid decatron is the most versatile card in this deck as two of them can be summoned from a void feast and they each can gain the level and effects of another infernoid monsters. They can gain negations, be used to XYZ and as they are tuners they can be used to synchro."

All I saw in the archetype were Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Blue-Eyes Fusion, and a bunch of ""of Blue"" tuners. I felt like this deck alone isn't good enough to make it on it's own. (For the people who were able to do this, great job!)  So I decided to up their support with some other side monsters. Invoked Fusion Monsters were good, but left a whole lot of space for cards and tuners (which I try not to use too much or less in a deck). I tried the Galaxy archetype, but it failed in being a great support (I saw other people make decks mixing Blue-Eyes and Galaxy monsters, so good job to them).  But finally, I found to perfect combination: Hieratics! All their effects Special Summon a Dragon-Type monster from my deck. So with their strategy and Blue-Eyes, I can unleash what is contained in the Extra Deck! I won three times in a row with this deck (I even beat a Cubic Deck with this once. Don't get mad at me if you can't do it, it was probably the way you used the deck). A very successful deck, you should try it.  &nbsp;  Here's the deck. Enjoy :)  (Like this if you want, the likes encourage me a lot!)  &nbsp;"

The Noble Knights seemed to be a good option because you can trigger them off Neo's as well as there own monster from normal monster, which gives you a good excuse to run Unexpected Dai.  &nbsp;  The deck is shockingly consistent and can play through a few negates, though it will end with a less impressive board. Though, if you were just playing Noble Knights or Hero's, you probably wouldn't have anything.  &nbsp;  The usual board is Dark Law, Arcana Extra Knight, and a Fusion. There are a lot of alt paths you can take with the combos, which can lead to more Noble Knight plays (for more removal), First of the Dragons (Solid Protection/stalling) or OTK if you can. I'm not very satisfied with the extra deck, so any suggestions on what I can add would be very appreciated.  &nbsp;  Play around with the deck and let me know what you think. It's better, in my opinion, then HERO and Noble's are on their own, but the ""boss monsters"" seem to struggle in this format. Turn one Dark Law is still pretty solid though.  &nbsp;  Add Whatever Side deck you like."

This now has more popping, healing and attacking power with the addition of Hexe Trude and Stromberg. Show yo","The point of this deck is to do three main things:  Cut off your opponent's graveyard  Heal for massive amounts of life points  Feed ""Da Eiza""  &nbsp;  If you have been playing on ygo pro lately, you have probably seen a variation of this deck. However, my deck has several built in win conditions. This done through a few simple combos. Lets go over a few:  Toll Hike or Extra Toll / Gravekeeper's Servant + Banisher of the Radiance / Macro Cosmos / Dimensional Fissure / Dark Law  This combo does not allow your opponent to even declare an attack. However, Toll hike doesn't allow you to make one either. Therefore, only use that as a last resort. This can stall for a while until you get Gren Maju Da Eiza. You also can use Lava Golem to put your opponent on an 8 turn clock. Lastly, you can use Battle fader (or Gren Maju Da Eiza if you do not have any banished cards; you can perhaps use necroface then have your Gren Maju Da Eiza have zero attack for this) and attack Lava Golem in order to activate Inferno Tempest (I on run one at this time. Even in a 60 card deck, I couldn't find any space for a second one. But two is not bad).  Ledger of the Legerdemain or Seer's Passbook / Inferno Tempest / Eater Of Millions / Pot of Desires + Soul Absorption  What makes this combo so op to me is that you're actually benefitting from the cost requirement of these cards. In most decks, the cost of Pot of Desires or even Pot of Indulgence is devestating. However, in this deck it's a huge plus. It allows for you to use the powerful draw engine card Ancient Leaf.  Trade-In + Danger! monsters (With or without banish cards)  Trade-In triggers the effects of Danger! monsters even when they're banished. This is just another bonus in this deck as everything fits well with each other.  Soul Absorption + Golden Castle of Stormberg + Necroface  This combo takes a bit of set-up to do. I put metaverse instead of terraforming because Stormberg's banish effect only works the turn after.  Funky one ofs:  Balance of Judgment: This card is incredibly op to me and no one is using it. It has no draw back to it  Gold Sarcophagus: I'm more surprised that Necroface didn't get limited rather than this card. In any case, I primarily use this card to activate necroface's effect while also adding it to my hand.  Please try the deck and leave me any feedback on what cards you took out and maybe would put in. Would be greatly appreciated.  &nbsp;"

This deck, however, exploring new territories, It's creating a burn deck with old school cards.  The object of this deck is to get Lava Golem onto the field, adding a mask of restrict on him, and having 2 nightmare wheels out all while building a wall of marshmallons and using kuriboh to mitigate damage.  There are other cards to help burn down the life points of your opponent throughout the deck.  This is my first ""serious"" deck that evolved from a deck i used to annoy people where the object was to return all the opponents cards to their hand before they could use them.  Made a few edits, I figured that Thousand-Eyes Restrict was a good card to put in this deck as another safeguard from your opponent attacking with Lava Golem, and Kuribohs have been changed out with their Rainbow and Winged Counterparts.  The Deck has been made larger, but there are more monsters and less traps and I think that's good for the overall scheme."

I've played around with an Artifact engine, but that can be super bricky and it's a ""Lets hope my opponent can't do anything without their extra-deck"" Strategy. While this can be successful in this format, it isn't consistent enough to be considered viable.  &nbsp;  What I took away from it is that the only elements of Evil Eye that are good enough are the field spell, the equip (obviously), and the Stratos. You can then use Serziels gimmick of destroying your own cards to gain advantage. Like I said previously, Artifacts work ok with this strategy, but I found it's better to supplement an entire engine that can benefit from the Evil Eye's being splashed in then rely on Evil Eye's as the core play makers.  &nbsp;  So the deck's idea and play style should be somewhat obvious from the list. Turn One: You get Serziel and equip it with Evil Eye (Which serves as solid protection and interruption/removal).  You then use any Metalfoes you drew into to set up your board for next turn (for when you'll be popping with Serziel(hopefully)). If you survive to turn 2, you should have accumulated plenty of advantage to be able to steamroll over your opponent, even if a lot of your board was dealt with.  &nbsp;  A notable combo is Using 2 Metalfoes to pop your field spell and your Evil Eye equip, then using the equips grave effect to return it to the field.  &nbsp;  This is by no means a finished product, but in testing, it did pretty well, especially after a few tweaks.

",This deck has many possibilities and an extremely strong turn 1. Going 2nd you have strong OTK potential but your board could be broken more easily. Main strategies include farm more than bringing out Full Armor Master right away even though it's extremely easy to do so. Generally you bring Wee Witch's out when you need a generic link also her effect synergies well with Black Whirlwind allowing you to search for even stronger monsters. Another big link is Summon Sorc which allows you to create Zephyros the elite onto your side of the field which can bring himself back from the dead by returning 1 face up card from your side of the field to your hand. This is important b/c its a huge extender and can secure black whirlwind back to your hand ignoring Simoon's secondary effect at the end of your turn. After Summon Sorc you'll make Bardiche and this is important because now you have a link in the grave for Borreload Savage and you also have Bardiche on the field to give you 2 fog blades. You use his effect send 1 phantom knights to the grave then the phantom knights effect removing it from play adding another fog blade to your hand. Lastly you make Borreload Savage which is 1 negate and you have 2 fog blades on the field. These combos are super lenient you can branch off into any extra deck monsters you feel you may need and it's all generally easy to do.

Good for Ritual beginners, can be taken to a Rogue le","If you've been looking for the Ritual Equivalent to Salamangreat's ""do stuff over and over again and achieve absolutely nothing until your opponent rips their hair out"" playstyle, boy do I have something good for you. Here we have a Gishki-Impcantation build that aims to spam Gishki Zielgigas, loop his non once per turn ""draw one, if it's a Gishki Monster then spin an opponent's monster to the deck without targeting"" effect, then summon Ravenous Tarantula to go in for the kill.  The aim in a Gishki Deck is to Ritual Summon using your own Ritual Monsters, creating costless Ritual Summons through the effect of Gishki Aquamirror. This is a very unusual playstyle, but given absolutely nothing is Once per Turn in the archetype, we can get away with some super degenerate stuff (Remember the weird Mind Augus FTK in 2013? No? You're better off not.). With this in mind, as mentioned before, we can loop Zielgigas to go up to +7 in good circumstances and potential break a board while doing so. Then, we can access Ravenous Tarantula to OTK our opponent, or attack with 2 Zielgigas and then bring out Gustav Max to burn them for game.  For your normal summons we have 3, although we do not use them too much. We're typically special summoning out the ass until we finally assemble a...small board with some big, big monsters. However, they are important to know when you're playing the deck when you're starting to run out of resources. <ul>  	<li>Gishki Beast <ul>  	<li>Your primary option, being able to summon Gishki Abyss from the graveyard to trigger his non once per turn ""Search a Gishki Monster"" effect.

Once again, something you do be obligation, not by choice.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> The searching ability of this deck is very vast, thanks to not only the sheer level of Gishki Abyss spam you're doing but also your Impcantations. We run 3 Candoll and Talismandra to search our pieces when Abyss cannot, as well as run 2 Bookstone and Penciplume in cases where we need to get something out the grave. However, we don't like to use Bookstone or Penciplume for their summon from the deck effects. You see, our Ritual Spell is always in the deck, and our Ritual Monsters are always in the hand. As a result this can create some awkward situations, so using them to summon the others is best. However, you may have reason to do it at some point. We also run one Chalislime to assist with our plays that bit more: discarding Abyss to summon something else is always a good thing.  For Draw Power, we have Zielgigas and Moray of Greed. These two work very well together, as typically your Ritual Monsters are in the hand after leaving the deck. Thus, you will very frequently have 2 Zielgigas in your hand at the end of your very long combo that achieves...not much, which are great for using the Moray to fetch your resources and keep the ball rolling. Don't run 3 Moray of Greed, as it is very bricky. Outside of that we don't have much, although Pot of Extravagance can be considered.  This deck has decent matchups against a lot of the meta decks, as cards like Ash Blossom or Ghost Ogre don't really do anything against it. It takes a Droll &amp; Lock Bird to halt this thing, and even then there's options out of that if your hand is favorable. We can very easily play through hand traps, but the issue we have is against stun effects. Thunder Dragons can especially screw over the deck, so I have provided a Side Deck that aims to dismantle them instead while still carrying other cards decent against Sky Striker, Altergeist, Guru Control and Salamangreat as well. Should be flexible but obviously you can edit that as you want.  We also have The Seven Sins in the Extra Deck who is relatively good against Thunder Dragons as well. If you're in a Droll-heavy format, definitely main deck Called by the Grave.  As a note for those looking at the OCG for future cards, Marincess Coral Anemone is shaping up to practically BE Gishki Support. While it locks you out of Water Monsters for the rest of your turn, this is an amazing last ditch effort to get more searches through reviving Abyss to get your plays off. Definitely replace Decode Talker with this one. Impcantation Creator - Crealtar is also looking like a good addition for the archetype to help build larger boards, and also help if you misplay and wind up locking yourself out of Ravenous Tarantula. He is also Level 10, which synergizes with the deck's ""bring out the tarantula"" aim perfectly. Like Chalislime, you definitely want to run 1 at least somewhere in your deck.  Overall this deck is a good starting point for those interested in Gishki or ritual decks as a whole, and can be used as a basis for future deckbuilding for other small ritual archetypes as well."
