However, after looking into the cards, they are very intersting to me due to the way they function. the 'Sons of Horus' cards can come back once as long as 'King's Sarcophagus' is in play. along with the aforementioned 'Son's of Horus', there are many available cards to support 'King's Sarcophagus'. In addition, the use of '<span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #212529; font-size: 16px;"">Orcustrated Babel' allows for many cards to use their abilities despite not even being on the field.

Pretty easy to attain early on, most of the stuff you can unlock by purchasing a copy of the The Dark Emperor Structure Deck from the store, and from that point you just have to craft more copies of the various Monarchs and D.D. cards.</p><p>This deck also just kinda breaks the game. More specifically, it breaks the AI - they can't handle the resource loop caused by constantly resummoning D.D. Survivor and D.D. Scout Plane. The resource loop also helps during the final stretch of the game where you have to play two to three duels in a row without LP recovery or resetting your deck - you can just constantly summon Survivor and occasionally tribute it for Monarchs.</p><p>You can probably modify various cards to more easily fit the slightly different banlist (replace a Dust Tornado with a MST since it's Semi-Limited in that game, etc.) but I posted a list that could also be legally used in Edison if you decide to use this IRL.</p>"

The cannon has a few rounds and can remove a player from the game very easily. Have had it play through some disruption but if the deck gets focused that definitely won't hold up.</p><p>Mathmech Multiplication is a good card to manipulate to your advantage as it enables a lot of quick kill options with the Four Bosses of the deck (Accesscode Talker, Darkfluid, Final Sigma, and Arrival.) Sending it to the grave via Darkfluid, Billion Blade, or Circular seem to be the easiest way to trigger it on demand. Got to get tricky with it otherwise.</p><p>Deck does not stuggle with getting out the bosses of the deck, just a matter of figuring out what can be made when.</p><p>Sigma works well as the deck master as if your board gets blown up or tributed as often as mine did, the free special summon does wonders for going into the next boss monster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Most of the budget goes into Ulcanix, lol.","<p>To my surprise, Promethean Princess didn't cost an arm and a leg, so I was glad I could add it to the deck.</p><p>Ulcanix is definitely the hardest card to get for the deck, since I'm 99% sure just one copy costs like 29 AUD at the most. I'm Australian, so it might be different in other countries.</p><p>Three Trolling Trolls are there due to the surprising lack of a Level 3 fire Beast, Beast-Warrior or Winged Beast tuners. Fire Fist Boar is there simply because it's easy to search, and this deck can actually pull off most of it's combos without using it's normal summon on a good hand.</p><p>Extra deck is just a Rank 8/ Rank 4 toolbox with Lavalval Salamander and Exlord because they're actually pretty solid for Fire based decks. Hiita is there just cause, and Promethean Princess is there because it's Promethean Princess.</p><p>Have fun. :)</p>"

The win condition is straightforward: go second King of the Skull Servants beatdown. The strategy revolves around using Lightsworn cards and strong extenders as board breakers to bait interactions while filling your graveyard with Wight monsters. Every match feels like a puzzle, especially if you match into a meta deck with layered interactions. If you enjoy decks like Dark World or Tearlaments, you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy this one, as it&rsquo;s all gas, no brakes.</p><p>First, use Lightsworn cards to mill as much as possible while searching Judgment Dragon. Typically you will want to Summon the Synchro Athena ASAP, who sends two more Lightsworn names to the graveyard. That way you can make sure one of the 4 Lightsworn names in GY includes Dragonling which searches for the Judgment Dragon upon being sent to the GY.</p><p>Then the next step is to summon Judgment Dragon and nuke the board repeatedly (it's not once per turn). Your opponent pretty much has to stop you from doing this with removal or special protection, or they are cooked.</p><p>After the field wipe(s), use your other engines to keep forcing interaction: The Xyz Athena to mill more, Horus lines into the Zombie Vampire, use 2 monsters to go into Fiendsmith lines, etc.</p><p>Once the coast is clear, focus on milling Wight cards. After using as many Wight mill effects as possible, end with Wightlord (searched via Wightbaking) to mill about 7-10 cards🔥🔥🔥, potentially triggering additional Lightsworn effects to extend further. Finally, summon King of the Skull Servants, whose ATK will easily surpass 8000.</p><p>If you need to go to turn 3 because you bricked, you can pivot by making a Kikinagashi Fucho or Assembled Nightingale that you will rank up into Zeus to clear the way for the King.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The whole point of the deck is to use a VERY small Unchained engine, to have the board end on a Unchained Soul of Rage, Wave High King CAesar, and any Rank 3 of your choice, with any hand traps or other back row to help disrupt your opponent's turn.</p><p>My favorite tech option is Reincarnation Unveiling Mail, the Equip spell tied to the Armored Xyz package. Searching this gives a free pop target for Sharvara that recurs itself during either End Phase as a possible deterrent for combat and possibly a way to close out a game. Full-Armored Xyz is still there, given how good of a card it is in the dec, but having that second target allows for (just barely) less predictable lines of play in the deck when searching for a card with Xyz Armor Fortress.</p><p>The ratios for the Goblin Bikers is to ensure that most hands, more often than not, are playable. While the deck still has a tendency to brick, it's more infrequent than one would assume. I'm also running two of the main Gone Wild targets in case I open one and it kills the combo a bit or different resources need to be used when they possibly didn't need to be.</p><p>I think this build is pretty good, but I will concede that the extra deck could use work and that the deck isn't quite as good as the Fiendsmith variant. However, it is a hell of a lot cheaper than that variant and gets the same job done.</p>"

Additionally it serves as a pseudo floodgate against cards that require specific attributes, the most prevalent of these is the fiendsmith engine.</p><p><strong>Metalmorph </strong>- By tributing a fiend or dragon we can bring out either of the metalmorph monsters which are powerful enough on their own. Where these cards truly shine is when lair of darkness is on the field allowing the tribute of the opponent's dragon or fiend cards. This comes up more often then you might expect as many boss monsters fall in these catagories, ie. Fiendsmith Desirae, Crimson Dragon ect.</p><p><strong>Bystial -&nbsp;</strong>These are the only hand traps in the deck and serve as dragons for Max Metalmorph. Unlike standard bystial usage, Baldrake is the best summon of the bystials as Lair of Darkness allows for the tribute of the opponent's monster to activate the effect, if timed right can shut down an opponents turn.</p><p><strong>Labrynth</strong> - This bridges the gap between the archetypes allowing for the search of metalmorph traps as well as offering a fiend for the summon of Metalzoa X. Lady Labrynth prevents opponents from responding to activation of normal traps with monster effects, insulating from Ash Blossom. Special mention to Big Welcome Labrynth which not only allows the summon of a labrynth monster but also can return bystials and Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay to the hand for reuse.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Supreme King Z-ARC -</strong> Utilizing Soul of The Supreme King prevents your opponent from activating spell effects (unless they want to let you summon 4 powerful dragons) as well as providing a 4000 atk beater for lethal or clearing the field of problematic monsters. Keep in mind it returns to the extra-deck at the end of the turn, counter it by tributing it for Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon which allows you to place either of the two pendulum monsters included.</p><p><strong>Pendulum Monsters -&nbsp;</strong>Vulminia - Statue of the Sacred Dragon turns any trap that summons a monster into a bounce as well as providing conditional battle protection.

When done right you should have at the minimum a 3 material Detonator, a Ancient Gear Dark Golem, a ryzeal cross and an ancient gear duel on board. In grave i normally have an ancient gear wyvern and an ancient gear tanker.</p><p>The idea of the deck is to use the ryzeal stuff to stop any big board breakers and create interruptions. If your opponent gets through that, you can use the ancient gear dark golem and the 2 ancient gear monsters in the grave to go into an ultimate ancient gear golem that can attack 3 times and is unaffected by monster effects. I prefer to do that fusion last just to lure out any last interruptions.</p><p>Have fun witht the deck and if you have any comments to make this deck even better, please leave a comment.</p>"

(Centur-Ion for example do stuff while back there, CBs just sit patiently) Well with Supreme Darkness the Crystal Beast strategy got a second wind in the form of 2 new monsters to utilize in their extra deck:</p><p><a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=58071334"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/58071334.jpg"" data-card=""58071334"" data-name=""Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon"">Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon</span></a> and <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=41739381"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/41739381.jpg"" data-card=""41739381"" data-name=""Clockwork Knight"">Clockwork Knight</span></a> do wonders for this deck.</p><p>However the first question we're gonna ask ourselves would probably be: ""Why would we even consider touching this deck from 18 years ago?""</p><p>The answer: ""Because it is based as fuck""</p><p>Also: Crystal Beasts might have the issue of being a pretty old deck, but it aged pretty well since its main gimmick was swarming the board with small monsters that can now be used for generic Xyz and Link fodder.</p><p>The next reason: <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=7093411"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/7093411.jpg"" data-card=""7093411"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus"">Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus</span></a> (while capable of missing timing) does NOT have a Once per Turn clause.
