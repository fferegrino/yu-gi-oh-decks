However, after looking into the cards, they are very intersting to me due to the way they function. the 'Sons of Horus' cards can come back once as long as 'King's Sarcophagus' is in play. along with the aforementioned 'Son's of Horus', there are many available cards to support 'King's Sarcophagus'. In addition, the use of '<span style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #212529; font-size: 16px;"">Orcustrated Babel' allows for many cards to use their abilities despite not even being on the field.

Pretty easy to attain early on, most of the stuff you can unlock by purchasing a copy of the The Dark Emperor Structure Deck from the store, and from that point you just have to craft more copies of the various Monarchs and D.D. cards.</p><p>This deck also just kinda breaks the game. More specifically, it breaks the AI - they can't handle the resource loop caused by constantly resummoning D.D. Survivor and D.D. Scout Plane. The resource loop also helps during the final stretch of the game where you have to play two to three duels in a row without LP recovery or resetting your deck - you can just constantly summon Survivor and occasionally tribute it for Monarchs.</p><p>You can probably modify various cards to more easily fit the slightly different banlist (replace a Dust Tornado with a MST since it's Semi-Limited in that game, etc.) but I posted a list that could also be legally used in Edison if you decide to use this IRL.</p>"

The cannon has a few rounds and can remove a player from the game very easily. Have had it play through some disruption but if the deck gets focused that definitely won't hold up.</p><p>Mathmech Multiplication is a good card to manipulate to your advantage as it enables a lot of quick kill options with the Four Bosses of the deck (Accesscode Talker, Darkfluid, Final Sigma, and Arrival.) Sending it to the grave via Darkfluid, Billion Blade, or Circular seem to be the easiest way to trigger it on demand. Got to get tricky with it otherwise.</p><p>Deck does not stuggle with getting out the bosses of the deck, just a matter of figuring out what can be made when.</p><p>Sigma works well as the deck master as if your board gets blown up or tributed as often as mine did, the free special summon does wonders for going into the next boss monster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Most of the budget goes into Ulcanix, lol.","<p>To my surprise, Promethean Princess didn't cost an arm and a leg, so I was glad I could add it to the deck.</p><p>Ulcanix is definitely the hardest card to get for the deck, since I'm 99% sure just one copy costs like 29 AUD at the most. I'm Australian, so it might be different in other countries.</p><p>Three Trolling Trolls are there due to the surprising lack of a Level 3 fire Beast, Beast-Warrior or Winged Beast tuners. Fire Fist Boar is there simply because it's easy to search, and this deck can actually pull off most of it's combos without using it's normal summon on a good hand.</p><p>Extra deck is just a Rank 8/ Rank 4 toolbox with Lavalval Salamander and Exlord because they're actually pretty solid for Fire based decks. Hiita is there just cause, and Promethean Princess is there because it's Promethean Princess.</p><p>Have fun. :)</p>"

The win condition is straightforward: go second King of the Skull Servants beatdown. The strategy revolves around using Lightsworn cards and strong extenders as board breakers to bait interactions while filling your graveyard with Wight monsters. Every match feels like a puzzle, especially if you match into a meta deck with layered interactions. If you enjoy decks like Dark World or Tearlaments, you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy this one, as it&rsquo;s all gas, no brakes.</p><p>First, use Lightsworn cards to mill as much as possible while searching Judgment Dragon. Typically you will want to Summon the Synchro Athena ASAP, who sends two more Lightsworn names to the graveyard. That way you can make sure one of the 4 Lightsworn names in GY includes Dragonling which searches for the Judgment Dragon upon being sent to the GY.</p><p>Then the next step is to summon Judgment Dragon and nuke the board repeatedly (it's not once per turn). Your opponent pretty much has to stop you from doing this with removal or special protection, or they are cooked.</p><p>After the field wipe(s), use your other engines to keep forcing interaction: The Xyz Athena to mill more, Horus lines into the Zombie Vampire, use 2 monsters to go into Fiendsmith lines, etc.</p><p>Once the coast is clear, focus on milling Wight cards. After using as many Wight mill effects as possible, end with Wightlord (searched via Wightbaking) to mill about 7-10 cards🔥🔥🔥, potentially triggering additional Lightsworn effects to extend further. Finally, summon King of the Skull Servants, whose ATK will easily surpass 8000.</p><p>If you need to go to turn 3 because you bricked, you can pivot by making a Kikinagashi Fucho or Assembled Nightingale that you will rank up into Zeus to clear the way for the King.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The whole point of the deck is to use a VERY small Unchained engine, to have the board end on a Unchained Soul of Rage, Wave High King CAesar, and any Rank 3 of your choice, with any hand traps or other back row to help disrupt your opponent's turn.</p><p>My favorite tech option is Reincarnation Unveiling Mail, the Equip spell tied to the Armored Xyz package. Searching this gives a free pop target for Sharvara that recurs itself during either End Phase as a possible deterrent for combat and possibly a way to close out a game. Full-Armored Xyz is still there, given how good of a card it is in the dec, but having that second target allows for (just barely) less predictable lines of play in the deck when searching for a card with Xyz Armor Fortress.</p><p>The ratios for the Goblin Bikers is to ensure that most hands, more often than not, are playable. While the deck still has a tendency to brick, it's more infrequent than one would assume. I'm also running two of the main Gone Wild targets in case I open one and it kills the combo a bit or different resources need to be used when they possibly didn't need to be.</p><p>I think this build is pretty good, but I will concede that the extra deck could use work and that the deck isn't quite as good as the Fiendsmith variant. However, it is a hell of a lot cheaper than that variant and gets the same job done.</p>"

Additionally it serves as a pseudo floodgate against cards that require specific attributes, the most prevalent of these is the fiendsmith engine.</p><p><strong>Metalmorph </strong>- By tributing a fiend or dragon we can bring out either of the metalmorph monsters which are powerful enough on their own. Where these cards truly shine is when lair of darkness is on the field allowing the tribute of the opponent's dragon or fiend cards. This comes up more often then you might expect as many boss monsters fall in these catagories, ie. Fiendsmith Desirae, Crimson Dragon ect.</p><p><strong>Bystial -&nbsp;</strong>These are the only hand traps in the deck and serve as dragons for Max Metalmorph. Unlike standard bystial usage, Baldrake is the best summon of the bystials as Lair of Darkness allows for the tribute of the opponent's monster to activate the effect, if timed right can shut down an opponents turn.</p><p><strong>Labrynth</strong> - This bridges the gap between the archetypes allowing for the search of metalmorph traps as well as offering a fiend for the summon of Metalzoa X. Lady Labrynth prevents opponents from responding to activation of normal traps with monster effects, insulating from Ash Blossom. Special mention to Big Welcome Labrynth which not only allows the summon of a labrynth monster but also can return bystials and Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay to the hand for reuse.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Supreme King Z-ARC -</strong> Utilizing Soul of The Supreme King prevents your opponent from activating spell effects (unless they want to let you summon 4 powerful dragons) as well as providing a 4000 atk beater for lethal or clearing the field of problematic monsters. Keep in mind it returns to the extra-deck at the end of the turn, counter it by tributing it for Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon which allows you to place either of the two pendulum monsters included.</p><p><strong>Pendulum Monsters -&nbsp;</strong>Vulminia - Statue of the Sacred Dragon turns any trap that summons a monster into a bounce as well as providing conditional battle protection.

When done right you should have at the minimum a 3 material Detonator, a Ancient Gear Dark Golem, a ryzeal cross and an ancient gear duel on board. In grave i normally have an ancient gear wyvern and an ancient gear tanker.</p><p>The idea of the deck is to use the ryzeal stuff to stop any big board breakers and create interruptions. If your opponent gets through that, you can use the ancient gear dark golem and the 2 ancient gear monsters in the grave to go into an ultimate ancient gear golem that can attack 3 times and is unaffected by monster effects. I prefer to do that fusion last just to lure out any last interruptions.</p><p>Have fun witht the deck and if you have any comments to make this deck even better, please leave a comment.</p>"

(Centur-Ion for example do stuff while back there, CBs just sit patiently) Well with Supreme Darkness the Crystal Beast strategy got a second wind in the form of 2 new monsters to utilize in their extra deck:</p><p><a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=58071334"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/58071334.jpg"" data-card=""58071334"" data-name=""Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon"">Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon</span></a> and <a class=""type-link-monster"" href=""/card/?search=41739381"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/41739381.jpg"" data-card=""41739381"" data-name=""Clockwork Knight"">Clockwork Knight</span></a> do wonders for this deck.</p><p>However the first question we're gonna ask ourselves would probably be: ""Why would we even consider touching this deck from 18 years ago?""</p><p>The answer: ""Because it is based as fuck""</p><p>Also: Crystal Beasts might have the issue of being a pretty old deck, but it aged pretty well since its main gimmick was swarming the board with small monsters that can now be used for generic Xyz and Link fodder.</p><p>The next reason: <a class=""type-effect-monster"" href=""/card/?search=7093411"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/7093411.jpg"" data-card=""7093411"" data-name=""Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus"">Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus</span></a> (while capable of missing timing) does NOT have a Once per Turn clause.

In the side deck there are more options for those banishing deck or if you prefer handtraps the board break. And tha core of the deck with running the essential 3x ohime 3x arabesque, but only 1 hare 2 huli and 1 nini, you can put Hare on 2 might be better this is NOT the most optimal so do changes try new things but the deck is fun and has the SUCCUMBING SONG MORGANITE it locks you from your ohime but hopefully will end the duel anyway, yes you might brick on it so its easy swap for one more Hare or Diviner.

The idea is to mill out your opponent fast. and it does just that and more. You want to board wipe your opponent? done. Want insane draw power? you got it. and this deck still keeps on giving. you also get stalls, boss monsters, and you can beat you opponent to death with there own cards lol. dont let the 2 different field spells throw u off they work well together. And the beautiful part is u can use field spells as bait to rip your opponent a new one. This deck is still in the testing phase as of 1/22/2025. so if you have read to this point you probably want 2 know a few combos? The biggest combo is using mimighoul maker to pick up cyber jar and any mimighoul u need at that moment most the time this will be dragon. then you go for the board wipe. combo 2 is to force flip mimighouls with swords of revealing light to fuck up your opponents deck and build your board..... SIDE NOTE: "" you can add the spell Book of taiyou to force more flip summons"". and combo 3 use mimighoul charm and force flip summon to rip cards from your opponents extra deck to your side of the field. i havent really built extra deck because most the time u wont need yours because you use your opponents :D thats about it please leave me some tips and ideas to improve this deck.</p>"

The deck wasn't intended to use all the <strong>Visas Starfrost</strong> connected archetypes in one deck but it turned out that way. Normally you do not think of Mannadium as a deck that wants to mil its cards however they turn out to have a surprising amount of cards that can gain you an advantage from the graveyard such as <strong>Viscious Astraloud</strong>, <strong>Mannadium Abscission</strong> &amp; <strong>Cross Sheep</strong>.</p><p>Starters are <strong>Scareclaw Reichheart</strong>, <strong>Mannadium Riumheart,</strong> <strong>Tearlaments Reinoheart</strong> &amp; ""<strong>Visas Starfrost</strong>"" (or cards that call themselves Visas Starfrost)</p><p><strong>Visas Amritara</strong> bridges your archetypes and allows Mannadium/Scareclaw lines to search <strong>Tearlaments Grief</strong> to start Tearlaments plays if you don't have access. Since <strong>Scareclaw Reichheart</strong>, <strong>Mannadium Riumheart</strong> and <strong>Visas Starfrost</strong> are <em>warriors</em> they can be tagged into <strong>Tearlaments Reinoheart</strong> via <strong>Tearlaments Grief</strong>. <strong>Mannadium Abscission</strong> is useful to trigger our Mannadium tuners and <strong>Tearlaments Schrein</strong>'s &amp; <strong>Tearlaments Havis</strong>'s graveyard fusion effects, it also has a beneficial graveyard effect to let us summon monsters that are named ""<strong>Visas Starfrost</strong>"" or have 1500ATk/2100 which allows us to extend into our starters if they are stuck in our hand.</p><p><strong>Cross-Sheep</strong> is the Link monster we want to try to make each duel, ideally, triggering both its synchro and fusion effects to boost our monster ATK and special summon either a tuner from the graveyard for synchro plays or one of our level 4 searchers. We can easily trigger Cross-sheep by summoning <strong>Vicious Astraloud</strong> to its link zone, by milling our deck it is not difficult to fulfil this summoning requirement, or we can summon a fusion monster using one of our Tearlament cards. <strong>Baronne de Fleur</strong> provides a disruptive negative and can destroy a card on the field once per turn, we can either destroy our opponent's cards or use it to trigger our own cards' effects such as our Mannadium tuners, Tearlaments cards and a large amount of our spell and trap line such as <strong>Rainbow Bridge of Salvation</strong> to search field spells with its graveyard effect. <strong>Spright Elf</strong> acts like <strong>Cross-sheep</strong> 2 with targeting protection though it's also useful for going into <strong>S:P Little Knight</strong>. <strong>S:P Little Knight</strong> is a great card that disrupts our opponent's plays, we can banish our <strong>Baronne de Fleur</strong> until the end phase along with an opponent's monster which lets us reset the negate if we have used it already letting us stack disruption.&nbsp;</p>"

Coined as one of Joey Wheeler's signature monsters in the first installment of the anime series, Flame Swordsman was literally just some guy with a sword that occasionally caught fire. Given that there was absolutely no way Joey would carry the fusion requirements, let alone Polymerization, in his deck, he just straight shotgunned a normal summon and boom. Fusion Monster.&nbsp;<br />The retrain, however, has proven to be a little lackluster. While it's a great, straight-forward OTK strategy, Flame Swordsman can't necessarily stand on it's own as a proper deck. Hence why we are pairing it with...&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Infernobles</em>! I've been meaning to build these guys since they released on Master Duel. Matter of fact, I'm almost certain I had the entire suite, but wanted to build a full-fledged Noble Arms deck and got too impatient. Regardless, I had the leftover dust from building Ashened (I know, I know...) and figured it was time to finally give these guys a shot.&nbsp;<br /><br />Infernobles are Noble Knights only... on fire. The end. Roll credits. Cue Linkin Park.&nbsp;<br /><br />But this particular strategy revolves around monsters becoming equip cards that also double as Synchro Material to reach their boss. Everyone is well aware that the deck is really good as a Rogue strat. Heck, there's probably several of these builds lying around.&nbsp;<br /><br />That said, we're gonna take a crack at making this a consistent, FIRE Warrior strategy.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">-&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p><hr /><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Endboard &amp; Combo Line Example</strong></span></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Let me just start by saying I absolutely LOVE how intuitive this deck is. At first, it took a second to really get the hang of how the cards worked, but it's almost criminal how well everything synergizes with each other.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you're familiar with the slang 'Voltron' in MTG or 'Towers' that's basically what we're trying to accomplish here.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our Turn 1 Endboard has us ending on both&nbsp;<strong>[Emperor Charles the Great]&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>[Ultimate Flame Swordsman]</strong>. Bonus points if you have&nbsp;<strong>[Immortal Phoenix Gearfried]&nbsp;</strong>in hand as it's an insane negate.&nbsp;<br /><br />To access a board like this, we would need only 4 cards total. So, not a dedicated 1-card combo, but sweeping strategies nonetheless. Regardless, anything you end on will be a problem for your opponent.&nbsp;<br /><br />The hand should look something like:&nbsp;<strong>[Fighting Flame Swordsman]</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ogier</strong>, <strong>Renaud</strong>, <strong>Ricardetto</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Gearfried.&nbsp;</strong><br /><br /></p><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Start with banishing Ricardetto to Special Summon <strong>FF Swordsman</strong>. Trigger the ETB and grab <strong>[Flame Swordsrealm]</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Normal Summon&nbsp;<strong>Ogier&nbsp;</strong>and dump literally anyone (<strong>Oliver</strong> is a great pick for extra protection)&nbsp;<br /><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>Renaud</strong>, add back whatever you feel like you need. (<strong>Turpin&nbsp;</strong>is a great dump as well considering you get an extra Special Summon)<br /><strong>4.</strong> Activate <strong>Swordsrealm </strong>and send <strong>FF Swordsman </strong>then Special Summon <strong>[Flame Swordsman] </strong>from the Extra Deck. GY Effect triggers and you'll want to send&nbsp;<strong>[Salamandra, the Flying Flame Dragon]</strong>. Then THAT GY Effect triggers and you'll want to grab&nbsp;<strong>[Salamandra Fusion]</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Equip&nbsp;<strong>Fusion</strong> to&nbsp;<strong>[Flame Swordsman]&nbsp;</strong>and activate the effect which will allow us to Special Summon&nbsp;<strong>[Ultimate Flame Swordsman]</strong>. Activate&nbsp;<strong>Salamandra FFD&nbsp;</strong>in the grave and equip it to&nbsp;<strong>UFS.&nbsp;<br />6.&nbsp;</strong>Now, we'll Synchro Summon into <strong>Angelica</strong>. With her, grab <strong>[Noble Arms Museum]</strong>, activate it and grab <strong>Almace</strong>.&nbsp;Activate it targeting <strong>Angelica </strong>to trigger her effect. Banish her and Special Summon the Synchro monster:&nbsp;<strong>Captain Roland</strong> (we're roland, roland, roland... WHAT?? Roland, roland... okay, I'm sorry.)&nbsp;<br /><strong>7. </strong>This is where things get a little tricky. Go ahead and equip one of the monsters from the grave onto&nbsp;<strong>Roland.&nbsp;</strong>Per&nbsp;<strong>[Noble Arms Museum]</strong>, we can Special Summon our <em>Infernoble</em> Equip Spell as a monster (PREFERABLY ONE THAT IS NOT A TUNER, very important.) From there Summon our boi&nbsp;<strong>Charles</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong>Thankfully, we can use&nbsp;<strong>Roland's </strong>second ability to equip him to <strong>Charles</strong> making him eligible to link off for&nbsp;<strong>[</strong><strong>Emperor Charles the Great.]&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong>Lastly, if you can, equip any remaining monsters to <strong>Big Boy Charles </strong>and use <strong>Gearfried's&nbsp;</strong>ability to banish any Equip Spell from field or grave to Special Summon. At the End Phase, <strong>Charles </strong>will add an Equip Spell from&nbsp;hand or grave on top of a FIRE Warrior Monster from Deck.&nbsp;<br /><br />BOARD COMPLETE!&nbsp;<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Follow-Ups &amp; Tech&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></strong></span>Tell you the truth? There's not much else this deck does outside of bringing out our 3 flaming bois and running over everything the opponent might dish out. The good news is that it's increasingly difficult given you can attach any of the <em>Infernoble </em>monsters onto all three of them respectively.&nbsp;<br /><br />As our secondary strategy, we have&nbsp;<strong>Princess</strong> and <strong>Amblowhale</strong>, of course. If anything, these will be our main recursion pieces as you can reborn <strong>Princess </strong>alongside any of the Link-2s used for her with <strong>Amblowhale</strong>, of which both are exeedingly glowing choices.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course,&nbsp;<strong>Princess&nbsp;</strong>can revive our main lads so it's best to save this particular line until some of our dudes are down and out.&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, <strong>Captain Oliver</strong>. As easy as it is to bring this guy out, he's definitely in ""last resort"" territory. The way I saw it was that they'd have to deal with an untargetable, destruction immune, swole AF&nbsp;<strong>Oliver</strong> while you set up your recursion line with&nbsp;<strong>Princess.&nbsp;</strong>Granted, most of my games have almost never gotten to that point. However, the option is there.&nbsp;<br /><br />For additional protection, we have&nbsp;<strong>[Fighting Flame Sword]&nbsp;</strong>which is basically the Swiss Army Knife of searchers. It also doubles as counter destruction against monsters attacking your FIRE Warriors and a Negate that specifically targets a&nbsp;<strong><em>Flame Swordsman</em>&nbsp;</strong>monster.&nbsp;<br /><br />We're also playing the in-archetype Trap Cards for added distruption as well as providing a workaround to bring out <strong>[Fighting Flame Dragon]&nbsp;</strong>of which nobody plays in most builds. I'm a big fan of utilizing the most out of any archetype and, since we're trying to dominate the board with just 3 guys, having another attack during the Battle Phase is quite nice.&nbsp;<br /><br />For Handtraps, it's important to note that our entire Spell &amp; Trap field will be preoccupied with our equips so Imperm, TTT and so on are out of the question with the exception of&nbsp;<strong>Called By.&nbsp;</strong>Any monster that can snap from hand will do, really.&nbsp;<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Sideboard</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Not too much to go into here. We have obvious picks like&nbsp;<strong>Baronne&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Diabellstar</strong> as well as some FIRE-Attribute tech in the event you're looking for some alternatives.&nbsp;<br /><br />You can do a lot with&nbsp;<em>Infernobles </em>alone, but alongside&nbsp;<em>Flame Swordsman&nbsp;</em>is where it starts to get a little too tight.&nbsp;<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Theorycrafting</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>I've been wanting to explore a <em>Salamangreat</em> variation just to see how it plays out, but we're short a couple of UR crafts, sadly. Even then, I don't think the ED will have nearly enough space, but we shall see.&nbsp;<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>I would confidently recommend this deck to anyone who stepped away from the game for an extended period of time and has no familiarity with modern mechanics.&nbsp;<br /><br />Not only is the main strategy simple to understand, but it's very easy to accomplish even against most disruption heavy decks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hell, I'd recommend this being the first deck for anyone starting out. Equip Spells were some of the first to make their way into circulation in the earlier years of the game. Introducing recognizable mechanics in the form of monsters is merely a speed bump sized hill in what is the learning curve of this deck. Even then, it's not even that steep to begin with.&nbsp;<br /><br />Either way, if you enjoy unga-bunga strategies with some added goodies, definitely give this deck a shot.&nbsp;<br /><br />-&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #404040; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;"">FOLLOW ME ON MASTER DUEL FOR ROGUE/MEME/NON-META NONSENSE&nbsp;<br style=""box-sizing: border-box;"" />181-209-956&nbsp;</p><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6rem; color: #404040; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 16px;""><br style=""box-sizing: border-box;"" />Also, feel free to use my campaign code in case you have a fresh account, or are just starting out: 00cdab64</p>"

You then revive Crystal Skull with Stonehenge or Adamancipator Signs and deal another 1000 damage. Cabrera Stone searches Triangle O on summon and Ashoka Pillar searches Stonehenge on summon, so they do not need to be run in multiples.<br /><br />Originally this deck would use Totem Pole by banishing it from the GY to double any effect damage dealt to the opponent that turn. In this build I eliminate the need for Totem Pole altogether by using Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis to halve the opponent's Life Points. This is due to Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket being more consistent and easily searchable thanks to synergy with the Adamancipator cards.<br /><br />The idea is to get Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket onto the field and send a Chronomaly Number monster from the Extra Deck to the GY (I use Chateau Huyuk here in case I need to make it with two copies of Tuspa Rocket, but Number C6: Chaos Atlandis would work for a bigger ATK boost on Atlandis in a pinch if necessary).<br /><br />After / during that you do the usual Adamancipator plays to get two Level 6 Synchros on the field and any of the three of Crystal Skull, Ashoka Pillar and Cabrera Stone. The two Level 6 Synchros can make Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis and attach Chateau Huyuk from the GY, then send it to the GY again to halve the opponent's LP. This eliminates the need for Totem Pole in the OTK since the opponent only has 4000 LP left and you don't need to double your damage. <br /><br />Totem Pole has been included in the Side Deck as an additional option if you can find space, as it's more of a shortcut to just set Totem Pole if you happen to draw it and destroy it with Triangle O. However I would recommend against running three copies or running Foolish Burial Goods as adding to the Spell / Trap count messes with the consistency of the Adamancipator engine.<br /><br />Cartorhyn and Saryuja can be used as extenders to enable additional Normal / Special Summons to help get your Triangle O pieces onto the field. Adamancipator Signs can also help with this, either by reviving them from the GY or reviving an unused Adamancipator and putting a piece on the top of the deck. I've decided against using Adamancipator Friends as it locks you into only Rock types after use (Atlandis and Skull Dread are Machine and Dragon, respectively) so this restricts their use early on and ironically makes hands brickier. Also, Gallant Granite fills the same role and can be summoned at any time.<br /><br />Living Fossil provides an alternate target for Ashoka Pillar to search assuming you already drew Stonehenge (and vice versa). It can help extend into Gallant Granite or the Synchros.<br /><br />Crystron Quandax and Morphtronic Earfon are included to allow you to ladder more easily with Cartorhyn. They give WATER and EARTH Level 4 Synchro Tuner options depending on if your other monster remaining on the field is EARTH or WATER respectively, allowing both to be on field to enable Cartorhyn's revival effect.<br /><br />Pilgrim Reaper is mostly included as an alternate summon instead of Chronomaly Atlandis if you decide to use Totem Pole after all, to increase the chance you might mill it off the top of your deck. If not using Totem Pole feel free to replace it.<br /><br />Adamancipator Risen Dragite and the Naturia Monsters are there in case you get interrupted by your opponent and need to divert into a defensive board.<br /><br />Foolish Burial can set up Cartorhyn or Adamancipator Signs (the latter is helpful in getting hold of Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket or Triangle O pieces, especially). It also sets up Stonehenge but I would recommend against using Stonehenge outside of the OTK unless you have a spare Adamancipator Signs, as you need to be able to revive Crystal Skull after using Triangle O.<br /><br />The Extra Deck can be updated to your preference, but the absolutely necessary cards are:<br /><br />- 1x Adamancipator Risen - Leonite<br />- 1x Adamancipator Risen - Raptite<br />- 1x Crystron Quandax<br />- 1x Morphtronic Earfon<br />- 1x Gallant Granite<br />- 1x Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis<br />- 1x Number 36: Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk<br />- 1x Saryuja Skull Dread</p>"

ARC-V Tag Force Special didn&rsquo;t make the list! The Yu-Gi-Oh! series (ARC-V, GX, 5D&rsquo;s, and Zexal) explores themes that can feel surprisingly unsettling beneath the surface. It&rsquo;s strange how these complex issues aren&rsquo;t discussed more, especially since exploring them could help us better understand and learn from them.</span></p><p><strong id=""docs-internal-guid-0a09ef27-7fff-7b6a-c03e-45c56fc3dddb"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0f0f0f; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">For example, the Main Yugioh serise dives into the harsh realities of systemic corruption, with inmates trapped in a brutal hierarchy where survival depends on exploiting others. The guards profit off the inmates&rsquo; suffering, creating a disturbing metaphor for unchecked institutional power. about how the characters are living after tragic moment like Simon saying don't drop the soap like how he was ra pe in jail and Jammie just always mad about he couldn't stop it just mad at the government while the Syun just making profits on the situational, but no one else have that&nbsp; type of money needed to buy these homes, but the government in which they already own these homes and lands in the first place, or how the rest of the people are scared and they are broken just not know what to do! </span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0f0f0f; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Similarly, GX raises questions about gender dynamics, with GX treats its female characters like trash. Female characters often sidelined or treated as plot devices rather than fully realized participants&mdash;highlighting frustrating societal norms. And did the people on the island really let a character just be killed? Or How the male characters treated the female characters...&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0f0f0f; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">In 5D&rsquo;s, the Satellite slums emphasize the disparity between social classes, showing how the powerful exploit the powerless. This dynamic, while not always explicit, highlights the moral decay of a fractured society.&nbsp; Kids like Rally are forced to steal cards to survive, while adults like Kalin Kessler manipulate them. Also I think a few of the characters where talking about raping the little kids since are always losing from the people they help with there stolen cards, or as a way to replay the for the best cards since those girls do have best playing deck. Sector Security doesn&rsquo;t care; they&rsquo;re too busy brutalizing the poor to maintain the elites&rsquo; playground.</span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0f0f0f; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Meanwhile, Zexal touches on broken families and resilience, with characters often shouldering responsibilities far beyond their years. Zexal where after the se x/ra pe of a female just broke down or was already missing something in the head since she had kids and turn to playing this game in a way to fight back and to get along with hers new kids though it's feel like the kids are taking care of the adults. This also replied how the cycles repeated, also rise the question about the female being ra pe by father and now her kid is her brother and son. </span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0f0f0f; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">lastly in Arc-V Where the Kids are copying the adults where. Since The &ldquo;apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree&rdquo; in ARC-V: Yuya&rsquo;s forced to mimic his father&rsquo;s dueling style, while Serena is brainwashed into becoming a soldier. The series starts in school, where kids are already weaponized&mdash;indoctrinated into war before they understand what they&rsquo;re fighting for. It&rsquo;s a gut-punch commentary on inherited trauma.</span></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""><br /><br /></strong></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0f0f0f; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Yu-Gi-Oh! isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;dark&rdquo;&mdash;it holds a mirror to society&rsquo;s worst impulses: ra pe culture in prisons, systemic misogyny, child exploitation, and cycles of abuse. These themes aren&rsquo;t spelled out, but they&rsquo;re there, festering under card battles and flashy monsters. For a series marketed to kids, that&rsquo;s terrifying. ARC-V Tag Force Special might be a game, but it&rsquo;s part of a legacy that forces players to confront uncomfortable truths.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #0f0f0f; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Agree?

Going first the deck focuses on using the Punk cards as a synchro 8 turbo engine to get into Primus and Centur-ion combo. Going second the deck can still Centurion Combo but ideally uses the standard Punk strategy to synchro for 11 and break boards.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Side Boarding</strong></span></p><p>In terms of side boarding the deck can side in additional breakers when going second and Crossout/Called by when going first. Against Malice specifically thrust for Sanctum ensures 6 copies of lancea when going first. The deck already has a decent matchup against Malice in my testing even without lancea so it's possible to go lighter on the lancea. The deck can struggle against Ryzeal going second which is why the side deck maximizes on copies of Ultimate Slayer. Siding out Sharakusai when going second is reccomended if the punk engine is trimmed at all during siding.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Ratios</strong></span></p><p>1 Card Starters: 16</p><p>2 Card Starters: 3 (Deer Note, Shirakusai, Rising Scale)</p><p>Bricks: 3 (Gargoyle, Atrii, Stand-up)</p><p>Non-engine: 19 + 1 (Pot of Prosperity)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maintaining 40 cards seems objectively incorrect in this version of the deck. The 2 card Punk starters require another Punk in hand otherwise they are bricks. Adding 2 extra Punks as cards 41/42 actually increases the chances that 2 Punk cards are drawn together while lowering the chance that any of the 1 off cards are drawn. Going up in cards also reduces the chance of drawing a brick. The downside is the odds of drawing two non-engine in the opening hand does go down slightly. The flip of cutting down non-engine to get to 40 cards may seem like a plus but where that does increase the chance of drawing 2 Punks it decreases the chance of drawing 2 non-engine (more than adding 2 more cards does).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deck does not play Centur-Ion Phalanx because there is already enough bricks in the deck and ideal engine draw is Punk cards regardless. This does limit the power of the Centur-Ion one card combos but at the end of the day the deck has far to many bricks. This version of the deck attempts to cut down on bricks as much as possible and reduce the odds of bricking in general.&nbsp;</p>"

Elzette Azamina simultaneously bridges White Forest, Azamina and Sinful Spoils together into one cohesive deck since she summons herself essentially for free and can search any Sinful Spoils card when she's used as synchro material! Sinful Spoils of the White Forest also has come out with Supreme Darkness, allowing White Forest to fusion summon its fusion monsters Ilia Silvia or more notably, Guardian Chimera! Finally, Supreme Darkness also has imported Magistus Chorozo, which gives the deck an easily accessible tuner from the Extra Deck, just by sending the GY a spellcaster and Extra Deck monster! The extra consistency that this deck has now allows White Forest to not only use the sizeable Toy Box engine and Bystial package, it allows room for 15 staples cards!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Increased consistency, enhanced power level and additional extension&nbsp; for White Forest is now possible with the new Supreme Darkness support!

White Forest cards also synergize very well with spell cards, since they use them as cost to enable them to spam tuners and synchro material on the field. The starters are 1 Astellar, 3 Elzette and 3 Silvy - all searchers and summoners from deck. 1 Rucia and 1 Azamina Elzette are used because they aren't starters, but it is a valuable extender since she summons from hand. 1 Tales of the White Forest (searcher), 1 Sinful Spoils of White Forest (quick fusion) and 1 Woes of the White Forest (interruption) are used since they all reset themselves on the field when they are sent to the GY as cost for a monster effect, and are combo pieces for the strategy.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A <strong>TOY BOX </strong>engine is used to further fuel the White Forest portion of the deck. Toy Box and Toy Soldier search each other, and Toy Box sets two cards from deck - giving White Forest plenty of spells to send to the GY as cost. It's not even a ""hard"" once per turn, so if you have multiple Toy Boxes you can keep setting resources from deck! The Toy Box monsters also summon themselves to the field whenever they're sent to the GY, so it gives additional bodies for synchro summons. Finally, Toy Box has a surprise battle phase effect to destroy attacking monsters by sending a set card to the GY, offering further defensive play. It is composed of 3 Toy Box, 3 Toy Soldier and 1 Toy Tank.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The <strong>BYSTIAL </strong>engine works extremely&nbsp;well with the White Forest strategy, granting the deck level 6 bodies to synchro summon with. It also allows access to a level 6 Dragon body to synchro summon into Bystial Dis Pater which has a lot of synergy with this light-focused deck. Since White Forest is a light deck, it also synergizes very well with the interactions Bystials offer. On top of that, Bystials counter a fairly big number of today's meta like Fiendsmith cards and rival White Forest duelists.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A mini <strong>AZAMINA </strong>engine is used to help bridge the Sinful Spoils and White Forest cards together.

In the Extra Deck, your fusion summon targets are Ilia Silvia (omni-negate) and Mu Rcielago (searcher).</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This White Forest decklist has 15<strong>&nbsp;STAPLE </strong>cards, despite having 4 different archetypes featured!

They consist of climbing to Synchro 6s -&gt; 8s -&gt; 10s and potentially link climbing as the combo goes on. Depending on your hand, White Forest duelists end on a mix of Chengying (banish), Dis Pater/Dragoon (negate + destroy), Diabelle (quick synchro), Silvera (set opponent's entire field), S:P (banish) and several handtraps in hand due to draws and searches. These boards are generally enough to stop an opponent's turn and outresource them for an OTK the following turn.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here is a regular opening combo for White Forest (Keep in mind this is only the basic combo, with more extenders like Bystials/Toy Engine the board gets stronger!):&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><em>Silvy + Elzette of the White Forest + 1 monster in-hand </em>= Ilia Silvia (omni-negate), Diabell (Quick Synchro-&gt; Chaos Angel banish or Silvera's ""Book of Eclipse), S:P Little Knight (Banish), Sinful Spoils of the White Forest (Guardian Chimera's multiple pops/draws), Draw 3-4 (Draw 1 with Rucia, another draw 1 with WANTED: Seeker of Sinful Spoils, and draw 1-2 with Guardian Chimera), Woes of the White Forest (Silvera's ""Book of Eclipse), + Elzette, Astellar, Rucia and Silvy recursion (follow-up for next turn).</div><ol style=""text-align: left; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1997""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Normal summon Silvy to search for Tales of the White Forest.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Elzette White Forest's effect in-hand to summon herself and search for Elzette Azamina.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Tales of the White Forest's effect in the GY to reset itself.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Elzette Azamina's effect in-hand to summon herself.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Synchro summon Rciela using Silvy + Elzette Azamina.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">CL1 Elzette Azamina's effect to search for Sinful Spoils of Deception, CL2 sending for cost Tales of the White Forest to search for Woes of the White Forest.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Sinful Spoils of Deception tributing one monster in-hand to search for The Hallowed Azamina.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate The Hallowed Azamina sending Sinful Spoils of Deception to the GY to fusion summon Azamina Mu Rcielago.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Mu Rcielago searches from deck WANTED: Seeker of Sinful Spoils.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate The Hallowed Azamina in the GY shuffling back Elzette Azamina back into the deck to it from the GY.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate The Hallowed Azamina CL1 to fusion summon Ilia Silvia (summon it either in the middle or side zones for Cross-Sheep), then CL2 WANTED: Seeker of Sinful Spoils to search for Diabellestar.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish WANTED: Seeker of Sinful Spoils in the GY to shuffle back Sinful Spoils of Deception from the GY into the deck to draw 1 card.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Summon Diabellstar from hand sending 1 card from your hand.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Diabellstar sets from deck Sinful Spoils of the White Forest.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Link summon Cross-Sheep using Mu Rcielago and Diabellstar.

Woes of the White Forest can quick-synchro into Silvera Wolf Tamer as well to set all your opponent's monsters facedown. Finally, S:P Little Knight can banish monsters on the field. Elzette and Astellar automatically summon themselves or add themselves back to their hand if certain conditions are met, giving you ample follow-up next turn. Finally, Rucia and Silvy can summon themselves from the GY by placing back from the field/GY Silvera, Rciela or Diabell!</div></li></ol><div style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><br />For your follow-up next turn, your incredible resource engines (Bystial/Toy Box) and White Forest recursion should allow you to out-resource your opponent!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Going first, you make an unbreakable board with multilayered interruption and with plenty of follow-up next turn.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Going second, you weaken your opponent with the 15 handtraps/staples you have.

You get so much interruptions that it's sometimes difficult to do it optimally! Usually, the best order of interruption for the White Forest duelist is Ilia's omni-negate, Diabell's quick-synchro -&gt; Chaos Angel, Woes of the White Forest's quick-synchro -&gt; Silvera, then when you recurred Elzette, Astellar, Silvy and Rucia, you can use that additional material for Sinful Spoils of the White Forest's fusion -&gt; Guardian Chimera. With your opponent trying to psyche you out, it's pretty difficult to do this properly, so practice makes perfect!</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">The Toy Box engine represents 3 separate pieces of material you get to use for White Forest's send fodder, as well as additional bodies on board for your Synchro, XYZ, Link and Fusion summons! Toy Box also isn't a hard once per turn, so if you have another copy, you can set more resources from deck!</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">If you have full combo (for ex. Astellar + Toy Box), try to go through your White Forest combo first, then go for Dragoon or whatever other synchro boss monster afterward. That way, if you get Nibiru'd you can still keep extending with your White Forest Synchro and level 4 White Forest lady in the GY.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">If you get Shifter'd, Droll'd, Mulcharmie'd or get hit some other lingering floodgate and can't extend anymore, make Bagooska to stall until your next turn so you can try comboing again.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Bystial Dis Pater and the Bystial engine can recycle and resummon your banished Light/Dark monsters!

White Forest can pump out very competent synchro-centric boards with threats like Dis Pater, Chaos Angel and Chengying! This reminds me of how Mannadium used to function in both lore and game mechanics - a lore heavy combo deck that builds unbreakable boards with immense amounts of gas! The rare ability to field a fusion powerhouse like Guardian Chimera and an XYZ staple like Bagooska is an amazing boon for this strategy as well giving it a lot of adaptability in any gamestate. Its resilience through handtraps, it's flexibility in the meta, and its sheer power as a combo juggernaut has earned White Forest a place in the highly competitive metagame dominated by the likes of Ryzeal, Maliss and Fiendsmith.</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;Don't underestimate these mysterious sorcerers from the forest, or else you'll be blasted away by their myriad of interruptions and sheer card advantage!

None of the other Unchained cards here actually lock into fiends either so you just get access to the Unchained interruptions with a fairly small deck investment and a bit of care</p><p>b) Shyama pops a card to special summon itself from graveyard, doesn't lock into fiends, and most of the Mikanko cards are reuseable from graveyard but it also acts as a way to set up equip spells for Oohime's effect or just make use of the set Cards from Sharvara. Shyama can only destroy face down/fiend exclusively which is of note but it's also literally any face down or any fiend monster and Mikanko steal monsters.&nbsp;</p><p>c) (besides Sarama) they're level 6 or 8s which means they're enough stars or more for ritual summoning Oohime (or whatever else fits) and, while not necessarily benefiting from being tributed, still have the aforementioned effects giving a way to amass board despite the cost for the initial ritual summoning</p><p>d)...Oohime discards i guess? enables most of the Unchained cards, pitching an Unchained for the search is pretty profitable, even the traps are useful since Sarama turns those into a body.</p><p>e) You can force your opponent to have something you can link off with the Unchained cards if needed or extra material for summoning whatever tech you fit into the extra deck since it's incredibly flexible.</p><p>the rest of the reasoning gets kinda vague but the idea in general comes down to:</p><p>Unchained has pretty decent board breaking while contributing to ur own advantage compared to traditional tools like Raigeki letting you pick more specifically which monsters you want left to abuse with the damage reflecting effects or steal etc. Though they only target which can be annoying it's still potent. Unchained don't really need a ton of cards to be able to access the majority of the deck/extra deck. They are pretty good link climbers and there's a fair few pretty potent link monsters.</p><p>The droll and triple tictacs are kinda placeholder, i figure you could fit more Unchained names in the main deck (like one of each other twins at least).

The consistency and powerboost that the strategy gets in the form of 5 cards in the form of Inclusion, Cluster, Suldafor, Tristaros and Eleskeletus actually propel the deck from unplayable to competitive! Crystron surprisingly goes toe to toe with top decks like Maliss, Ryzeal and Fiendsmith variants and can grind them out in an extended game. The deck is now consistent enough to jam in about 20 staples, it has a ton of inherent gas, and by nature of how Crystrons combo many common handtraps don't effect them much. They can weave and make plays through powerful lingering handtraps like Shifter, Mulcharmies Droll and Nibiru - and of course, minor handtraps like Veiler, Ash Blossom and Imperm get shrugged off.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Crystron is a difficult deck to play because of all the combo lines for each sort of gamestate, so it rewards a highly skilled pilot. If you're looking for a powerful midrange deck that catches duelists off-guard with weird combo lines, I highly recommend playing Crystron!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong><em>Want to see the deck in action?

The Crystron deck core is fairly compact, consisting of 18 cards.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">The 3-ofs in the deck are Inclusion (searches any Crystron card) and Smiger (searches spell/trap, basically Inclusion) since they are both 1-card combos that get you your full board and GY set-up. Sulfefnir is a 3-of as well since it is a important combo piece that replaces itself (just like Kashtira Fenrir)!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">2-of Tristaros are used since it is the key piece of the deck which allows synchro summoning during your opponent's turn, and can summon 2 Crystrons at once from your deck. It is this deck's best normal summon, since if your opponent does something, it can react to it to immediately and synchro summon. This number can be bumped up to 3 if you like extra consistency. Sulfador is used at 2 as well since it's a double foolish burial! It's a highly searchable combo piece, but two is needed for an extended grind game.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">1-of of Prasiortle (summons from hand), Rosenix (summons a token) and Thystvern (searches monster) are used since they are highly searchable combo pieces, each with a certain specific use in different situations. 1 Cluster is used as this deck's ace trap card interruption, able to destroy an opponent's card by shuffling back Crystron cards from the GY or Banishment - giving the strategy potentially infinite grindgame!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">A tiny <strong>SPEEDROID </strong>package of 4 cards is used in this deck as a consistency booster, composed of 3 Terrortop and 1 Taketomborg. These special summon themselves without using up your normal summon and these 2 level 3s can link summon Cherubini. Cherubini can send any level 3 from deck to GY for cost, including Smiger which is full combo!&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">This Crystron decklist has a whopping 19<strong>&nbsp;STAPLE </strong>cards! The best handtraps for the current meta are included, including x2 Nibiru, x3 Ash Blossom, x3 Imperm, x3 Fuwalos, x2 Droll and x3 Veiler granting a total of 16 handtraps. 1 Foolish Burial and 1 Pot of Prosperity are added for consistency. 1 Called By rounds out the staple line-up.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>COMBOS AND GAMEPLAN</strong></div><div style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">In terms of interruption, the board that Crystron sets up is relatively straightforward. It ends on 1 targeted pop with Cluster, 1-2 spell/trap negates with F.A. Dawn Dragster and potentially triple monster banish from field/GY with Quariongandrax. Some hands can pivot into Cyber Dragon Infinity's omni-negate.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Regarding execution of the Crystron strategy, it's fairly difficult&nbsp;to sequence interruption properly, especially if your opponent doesn't play into it. Crystron's gimmick is all about quick-synchroing during your opponent's turn, and those actions are only available during your opponent's Main Phase or Battle Phase. If you don't have proper synchro materials on-board or in GY, the quick synchros won't work, especially Quariongandrax which specifically requires two tuners.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">That being said, if you get handtrapped, you can generally still end on Cluster's targeted destruction and sit on your handtraps. Next turn, you can attempt to combo again with your set-up GY/Banishment.&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Here a regular 1 card opening for Crystron:&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">Inclusion = Double F.A Dawn Dragster (x2 S/T negate), Crystron Quariongandrax (triple monster banish in-field/GY), Crystron Cluster (targeted pop), + follow-up for next turn.&nbsp;</div><ol style=""text-align: left; flex-direction: column; display: flex;"" start=""1"" data-listchain=""__List_Chain_1997""><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; align-self: start; text-indent: 0px;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Inclusion to search for Sulfador.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Sulfador targeting Inclusion to destroy it.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">On-summon, Sulfador sends to the GY Cluster and Thystvern.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Thystvern in the GY to search for Tristallos.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Normal Summon Tristaros.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Synchro summon Eleskeletus using Tristaros + Sulfador.</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">On-summon, Eleskeletus recovers Cluster from the GY.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Tristaros from the GY to destroy Eleskeletus and summon Sulfefnir and Rosenix.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Eleskeletus' trigger effect when destroyed to summon Tristaros from Banishment.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Rosenix's effect to targeting Sulfefnir to destroy it and summon Citree from deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Activate Sulfefnir's effect to summon another Sulfefnir from deck.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Synchro summon F.A Dawn Dragster using Citree + Sulfefnir.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">Banish Inclusion from the GY to summon Citree from the GY.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent's Main/Battle Phase, activate Citree to summon Sulfefnir from the GY to synchro summon a second F.A Dawn Dragster using Citree + Sulfefnir.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent's Main/Battle Phase, activate Cluster to target destroy 1 card your opponent controls by shuffling back Citree from Banishment.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">During your opponent Main/Battle Phase, activate Tristaros summoning Citree from deck to synchro summon Quariongandrax using Tristaros + Citree + level 5 F.A.

Learning to properly sequence your interruptions, especially in the heat of the moment is difficult, so practice a lot! Otherwise, the deck is simple and straightforward to learn.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;""><div style=""margin: 0px;"">The interruptions from Crystron is relatively minor compared to decks with bigger boards like Ryzeal and Maliss. The strength of Crystron comes from resilience through interruption and a robust grindgame. If you can force out a grindgame from your opponent with full Crystron set-up you have a high chance of winning.&nbsp;</div></li><li style=""font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">If you get hit by a crippling handtrap like Fuwalos or Shifter, the best thing to do is set up Crystron Cluster and sit on your handtraps.

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical playing with the new Crystron cards, but they are suprisingly powerful and resillient! There are combo lines to get through nearly every harrowing situation, and the ability of the strategy to play evenly matched in grindgames vs. meta powerhouses like Ryzeal, Maliss and Fiendsmith is incredible! These quick-synchro bots have served me well in online ladder and perhaps at Locals when I take the deck there. I hope you duelists have as much fun with Crystron as I do!</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"">GLHF Duelists! </div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Dominus impulse isn't exceptional this format so it's cuttable the only real miss are the mulcharmys. If you can't afford abyssgiaos play a zealantis so going second you can use coral anemone zealantis to board wipe as you'll be locked into water and can't summon back the opponents monsters. Also If you can't afford abyssgiaos go into abysstrite summon back a level 4 and use the equip spell (searched off mermail king - neptabyss) to make a dweller alongside your double toad's made off coelacanth. The 16 hand traps should also stop most decks but if you want to you could swap them out for board breakers. I'd recommend playing taking out all the handtraps and playing 1 detonator and 1 aggregator for millenium eyes restrict and dragite so you can metaltronus both ryzeal and maliss and have a good ultimate slayer target against ryzeal, 3 ultimate slayer, 3 metaltronus, maining the 2 poseidra in the side deck, 3 dark ruler no more and 3 forbidden droplet while cutting the deck down to 40. I would change the side deck to 3 droll for mitsiguri as board breakers aren't amazing against them; 3 lancea and 3 chaos hunter for maliss as board breakers aren't amazing against them; 3 dimensional barrier as most handtrap decks which could stop your combo aren't link decks at the moment so they will pass back to you after dimensional barrier and 3 xyz encore to stop dweller and give you an extra board breaker against ryzeal. This deck's main problem at the moment is dweller so try to stop your opponent getting their but hopefully it will be banned soon and this deck can become a lot more meta</p>"

I wish I could have worked more Subterror cards in here so that it was an acutal proper subterror control deck but when I tried that it was honestly too slow / I bricked way too much so I downsized it into primarily a Guru Control strategy.</p><p>Got the idea while looking for decks that would synergize well with Heat Wave and found a Subterror deck on here that had Heat Wave/Skill drain in the side deck and thought that was a funny idea. Shoutout to whoever made this deck:</p><p>https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/subterror-alternative-542513</p><p>Z-ARC idea came from watching a YouTube video on playing Flame Swordsman as a control/trap strategy.</p><p>Example combos/synergies:</p><ul><li>All Subterror effects are still live under Skill Drain as long as you activate Subterror Final Battle every turn and choose ""prevent effect negation"". Your Subterror monsters can also get massive under Skill Drain via Subterror Final Battle and Subterror Cave Clash.</li><li>Activating Subterror Final Battle can trigger Lord of the Heavenly Prison and also Lady Labrynth of the Silver Castle. Both of these cards can also search Subterror Final Battle.</li><li>Subterror Final Battle is NOT once per turn!! You can play two copies and get two flips/attack boosts etc.</li><li>Similar to Skill Drain trick: Heatwave prevents Normal/Special Summons of effect monsters but doesn't stop Set/Flip summon. You can activate Heat Wave at start of Main Phase 1. Set Guru. Flip Guru using Final Battle or The Hidden City to get search.&nbsp;</li><li>All the Subterror monsters are different levels and types so they're all still playable under There Can Only Be One and And the Band Played On.&nbsp;</li><li>And the Band Played On is a decent floodgate, especially against swarm decks with a lot of monsters with the same level/rank.</li><li>Soul of the Supreme King + Z-ARC can be used as a board wipe. Z-ARC's boardwipe will trigger on summon but because it's effects are negated by Soul of the Supreme King. However, if you flip it facedown it's effects stop being negated so the boardwipe will go off. This deck has a few ways to do this:<ul><li>Z-ARC hits the field and its effect activates -&gt; Chain book of moon, destructive daruma karma cannon, or guru's effect.<ul><li>If using Guru's effect: Make sure you have another face-up subterror card so it's a quick effect! If you forget you can chain Final battle (pick any of the effects other than flipping guru face down) to Z-arc's activation and then, bc final battle is face-up, you can chain guru's effect.</li></ul></li><li>You activate Soul of the Supreme King -&gt; Chain Final Battle to flip up Guru (make sure you have another subterror card face-up so it's effect is quick effect) or Ultramafus -&gt; Z-ARC hits the field and its effect activates -&gt; Chain Ultramafus' flip effect or Guru's quick effect depending on what you flipped.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Random caveats:</p><ul><li>I almost always use Heat Wave &gt; Extravagance if I have both in hand on first turn. Heat Wave is harder to negate if going first and also I just enjoy it more so there's that.</li><li>I don't really use the extra deck except for potential Z-ARC so I didn't put a lot of work into it. Could be improved/tweaked.</li><li>The OCG and TCG have different rulings on whether both Guru and the other monster need to be flipped for it's flipping face down effect to be activated. There's also some funkiness around whether the Subterror monster Fiendess targets needs to be flipped for the negate to work but forgot the specifics.</li><li>I usually search out Guru -&gt; Final Battle -&gt; Fiendess -&gt; Ultramafus -&gt; Cave Clash in that order for my guru searches.</li><li>If you have both Guru and Hidden City, always set Guru and then use Hidden City to flip him to get his search on turn 1!</li></ul>"

Side deck right now is other cards I'm still experimenting with.</p><p>Build notes:</p><ul><li>When going first, on your end board try and avoid leaving more than 1 mimighoul on your opponent's field at the end of your turn if you don't know what kinda deck they're running.<ul><li>Leaving more than one mimighoul makes it easy for them to get rid of them by tribute setting for common level 7/8 monsters like Kashtira Fenrir, Blue Eyes White Dragon, Dark Magician, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Avg. end board is:<ul><li>Mimighoul Dungeon + Mimighoul Master + Mimighoul Throne + Giant Mimighoul and some traps in backrow and 1 mimighoul special summoned to opponent's field.</li><li>Having swords of revealing light or summoning curse up are ideal floodgates.</li></ul></li><li>Summoning curse in this build is an insane hand rip in this build because you can banish 1 card from your opponent's hand every time you special summon a mimighoul to their field.<ul><li>If you have summoning curse, it can be tempting to activate at the start of your turn because you might summon enough mimighouls to banish most of their hand, but setting up your board also costs a bit of special summoning so I typically only activate summoning curse when I'm done special summoning to my own field and/or if I have something I'm okay with banishing (Ex. a second copy of mimighoul fork).</li></ul></li><li>Would not advise using summoning curse against Maliss players lol.</li><li>On your first turn, always choose dragon + archfiend if you're using mimighoul maker and have no mimighouls in hand. If you already have a dragon or archfiend in hand then feel free to pick other cards and use the special summon off maker to special summon either the dragon or maker in hand.</li><li>If you have swords of revealing light in hand then you can just special summon a bunch of mimighouls to your opponent's field and activate swords to flip them and trigger all their effects.<ul><li>Every mimighoul deck should run Swords of Revealing Light. Period. It's such a useful card for this archetype.</li></ul></li><li>In all honesty, mimighoul fork is not that good of a card. But I like using it as a decoy in my backrow to draw attention away from my other traps or just trick my opponent into thinking there's more follow-up than there is.</li><li>Triple tactics talent + thrust is live if you can flip a mimighoul on your opponent's side of the field using fork/master/swords etc.</li><li>Mimighoul has a lot of good synergy with Kashtira for the above reason but I personally just like playing the pure build so I didn't include Kashtira cards. Maybe in the future I'll build another one.</li><li>Big part of this build is using cards like Floodgate Trap Hole, Terror of the Overroot, Reverse Reuse, and Mimighoul room to put facedown monsters on your opponent's field to stop their special summoned monsters from attacking and stop them from normal summoning.<ul><li>Funny combo is waiting for your opponent to hand trap you then activating terror of the over root to send a key combo piece to the GY and put their hand trap facedown on the field (Ex. Ash).</li></ul></li><li>Mimighouls are still decently effective under skill drain (as long as they're on your side of the field already). Because they get their massive attack boost from mimighoul dungeon.</li><li>You can use Giant Mimighoul's burn effect to finish off your opponent's if they're close to death. You can destroy your own cards too to burn them! Just don't try and destroy Mimighoul Master with Giant Mimighoul because it's protected from effect destruction while you have other mimighouls.</li><li>In mimighoul mirror matches, it's important to remember that Mimighoul Dragon's board wipe DOES NOT affect other mimighouls.</li><li>In mimighoul mirror matches, you should also remember that if you can flip your opponent's mimighoul flip monsters facedown on their side of the field they'll become your mimighouls when they're flipped back up.</li><li>Mimighoul dragon's boardwipe effect can get around so many protections because a lot of boss monsters have card text protecting them from being ""destroyed by your opponent's card effects"" but these protections don't apply to being destroyed by a player's own card effects. Because mimighoul dragon is controlled by your opponent when it's boardwipe effect activates, it's destruction effect is counted as a player's ""own card effect"" rather than ""an opponent's card effect"" and can get around a lot of these protections.<ul><li>Ex. Chaos Angel summoned with a light monster as material has the effect ""<span style=""color: #0f0f0f; font-family: Inter, 'system-ui', -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;"">Synchro Monsters you control are unaffected by monster effects activated by your opponent."" However, if mimighoul dragon is flipped on your opponent's side of the field, it's flip effect is technically being triggered / activated by whatever player is controlling it so it would be able to destroy Chaos Angel.</span></li></ul></li><li><span style=""color: #0f0f0f; font-family: Inter, 'system-ui', -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;"">If you steal an opponent's monster with mimighoul cerberus and you have other mimighouls lying around on your field, consider linking it off into I:P Masquerena.

But keep in mind that WF likes to have plenty of Spells/Traps in hand.Your go First is excellent, not much can beat you and you can play through 3 HT on normal hands.Going Second, depend on the BoardBreakers and the engine you will touch, I would say it is average.<br /><br />Shifter is an instant lost, Droll is a lost unless your Fiendsmith engine is active.<br />Nibiru alone is not threat unless with a combo of other HT.
