That's in theory is easy, but in practice will be hard to go first, since King of the Skull Servants has no negates or protection, also will be hard to go second, since your enemy probably has at least one negate or disruption in his field, but i love skull servants.  'The Chaos Creator' is to recycle the combo and for XYZ summon.  Because of the deck don't having any good negate, i added Solemn Judgment, but it's not completely necessary and aslo can be replaced by some hand trap like Infinite Impermanence or ash.  GLHF"

Look I love the color blue, blue cards are awesome, and not these knock off dollar store blue cards called ""link"" monster... even if they do dominate the meta.  This deck runs 3 engines: <ol>  	<li>Drytrons: Purely to search out ritual monsters, spells, and summon Mu Beta Fafnir to help with ritual summoning with Meteonis Drytron.</li>  	<li>Nekroz: These are the blue cards we're looking for. Nekroz monsters are power crept in the game, although their search power and consistency is still unmatched my most deck and should not be overlooked. Unicore is a skill drain for all extra deck monsters. You see that Dragoon? What's that it can't be targeted or destroyed by battle? With my homie Nekroz of Unicore Dragoon is just a 3k beat stick that my blue bois can steam roll over.</li>  	<li>Fairies: Look, Herald of Ultimatness is amazing, but popping off with Drytrons and having him on the field with 4 fairies in your hand as omni negates isn't fun for me. I like to play with my opponent, not stop them from doing anything fun. If you want meta go play any of the meta Drytron Fairy deck and make people hate you at locals. Now for what we play. Benten needs to be banned but until it is run him, Diviner, Orange Light, and Eva. I would run 3 Diviners but I'm making this profile for someone who doesn't have 3. All of these are good cards and with diviner being able to become a level 6 when sending arc light with her effect and is a tuner means you can actually synchro level 8 monsters. More on that later.</li> </ol> This deck has one main goal: <ol>  	<li>Get Unicore on the field alongside your strong ritual monsters (Draconids, Valkyrus, Areadbhair). Non of your monsters are extra deck monsters meaning Unicore only effects your oppenent. All of your strong monsters can still use their effects because their rituals.</li> </ol> How do we achieve this goal?: <ol>  	<li>Drytron comes in handi for this. In my mind they are the fuel for the entire decks engine. The most important ones, in this order, are Alpha, Zeta, Gamma, Delta. As long as all 4 exist in your hand/field/GY you can cycle through them all each turn. If you have all 4 available, go through them in this order: <ol>  	<li>Start with Alpha: Get any ritual monster you may need</li>  	<li>Zeta: Get a ritual spell. Meteonis can summon all ritual monsters including the harder to summon Nekroz ones (Areadbhair/Valkrus/Trishula) as long as their in the GY (so dump them to the GY for a Drytron effect). I always want a Meteonis before the Nekroz specific rituals. Nekroz Kaleidoscope is the next best, followed by Cycle, then Mirror.</li>  	<li>Delta: Reveal that ritual monster or spell that you will always have in your hand and get a free draw card.</li>  	<li>Gamma: Instant Mu Beta Fafnir summon, materials can be used to ritual summon, dump Draconids from deck, use meteonis drytron to ritual Draconids from grave, lower Mu beta fafnir attack to bring back Meteonis to hand, profit.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>The Nekroz monsters are really good at searching themselves but for the most part I just use them as tribute fodder for the Drytrons then bring them back from grave, use their in hand effects, or straight up summon them.</li> </ol> The extra deck contains some creatures they are not meant to be summoned but instead meant to be sent off of Kaleidoscope. What this means is you can trade these out for any other extra deck Synchro of Fusion with the same levels and they will serve the same purpose, although I picked these for a specific reason and will note them below. These include: <ol>  	<li>Herald of Arc Light (also sent to grave with Diviner of Herald). I would keep this becuase its synergy with Faries is too good.</li>  	<li>Elder Entity N'tss (I've personally made a Meta Dragoon player at locals scoop because I destroyed their $100 dragoon with this with the Unicore play I describe below. I will always run this. That's what you get for playing a meta deck against actual 12 year olds trying to have fun at locals you ass. As an adult I feel responsible to right these poor kids when someone is trying way too hard to win. We need new people to be in this game to keep it alive and it's our responsibility to make sure they have a good experience and teach them nicely. Laughing at them when you beat them with a $1,000 deck against their structure deck their parents bought them is not cool. Ok, rant over).</li>  	<li>Stardust Dragon is a good level 8 to send or summon with Herald. I would keep this as a level 8.</li>  	<li>Trishula is just a level 9 to send for a Brionac and Clausolas summon, replaceable with another level 10.</li>  	<li>Ruddy Rose is a level 10 for a Brinac and Unicore summon, replaceable with any other level 10. I just think the secret rare of this looks beautiful and I happened to pull one.</li>  	<li>2 Stardust Divine Sifr. 2 level 12's is very smart because with Kaleidoscope you can summon: <ol>  	<li> 2 Brionacs (6+6)</li>  	<li>Valkyrus and Unicore (8+4)</li>  	<li>Trishula and Clausolas (9+3)</li>  	<li>Not to mention when this card is in the grave due to Kaleidoscope you can resummon a properly Synchroed Stardust Dragon from the Grave. This card does a lot of work in this deck</li> </ol> </li> </ol> It's hard to lay out any one specific combo because this deck has so many ways to get to the same end board. I mean half your cards say something along the lines of ""search desired card"". This deck is more about what you're trying to do and less about how you get there, because you almost always get there. Just don't get Droll and Lock Bird'ed.  Some fun things this deck can do in situations: <ol>  	<li>From hand Nekroz of Valkyrus can end the battle phase instantly. Many times when you have Unicore on the field people try to attack over him so their monsters have their effects back; this tells them no.</li>  	<li>If you're able to get 2 Brionac in your hand, play Nekroz Kaleidoscope to send a level 12, special summon both the Brionacs, then XYZ into Gauntles Launcher for the memes of destroying stuff on the field.</li>  	<li>If your oppenent summons the dreaded Dragoon and doesn't negate the Kaleidoscope while you attempt to summon Unicore you're in for some fun.  Play Kaleidoscope to send Elder Entity N'tss to summon Unicore. Unicore on summon shuts off all extra deck monster effect, meaning Dragoon is just a sad dragonborn sorcerer with no spell slots left (D&amp;D reference for those who don't understant). That Elder Entity N'tss that you sent to the graveyard can now target the Dragoon and destroy it. LOL.</li>  	<li>If you send Arc Light off Diviner of the Herald to make him a level 6 you can synchro with a level 2 to actually summon stardust dragon which is fun. Then if you Kaleidoscope the Stardust Sifr you can banish Sifr  to resummon stardust dragon since you were able to properly synchro startdust. Pretty cool imo. This is only possible with Diviner of the Herald.</li> </ol>"

The goal is to slow your opponent down with savage preventing otk and then on your turn use bsl field spell in tandem with dillingerous ef in grave to pop off into borrelend.  What to do when board is broken: recover with furious ef; attack using link 2 go into stronger monster by using rokket recharger ef to recover link4/5 in grave; excharge dragon comeback  Explaining several deck choices:  Why no hieratic heavenly spheres? spheres is good for control but this is a combo deck maxed out meaning we keep extending with dillingerous always plus spheres cannot be recovered with furious  why 3x furious dragon and 3x dragon's mirror? answer: furious is my favorite borrel card with recovery and interruption ability you can cut 1 dragons mirror and furious so you are less likely to brick with double dragon's mirror, however I don't recommend it since you can use it on the following turn for recovery  Why no ritual Borrel Riot dragon or Duelweil dragon?  answer: elpy was banned so now duelweil is not practical to summon since you have to hard draw it.  riot is ritual so pre-prep of rites works with it but it takes on field monsters which hinders link plays alot and you have to run the 2 bricks 1 ritual spell and 1 riot dragon.  3x  pot of desires why? answer: mandatory draw power use after searching with striker dragon for bsl love draw power  Conclusion:  GL have fun and combo off into explosive victory!!!  &nbsp;"

Vylons aren't terrible and have seen a few semi competitive variants through the years, but only one of those is even remotely playable, that being omega turbo. A weird sacky deck that takes a large amount of setup, but puts up some insane boards if it pops off.  The Combo (element, Kay-est, vylon equip spell, non-tuner vylon):  Element summons a tuner from deck whenever an equip spell is destroyed (not once per turn ), kay-est pops cards equipped to the card it's equipped to, and the vylon equips all float into another one when the are sent to grave. This gives you a shit ton of link material (or synchro, or xyz) to do basically whatever you want. the issue comes from the fact that this is a four card combo that takes two specific cards that aren't really searchable.  This version of the deck is mainly just to shit out a ton of links to do shit. This is most likely not the optimal build of the deck, but it can be funny"

Below is a link showing of an example combo.  https://www.duelingbook.com,"This deck specializes in making a very strong first turn board using just two cards with up to 5 or more interactions. I will both explain the combo and post a replay showing a general first turn combo <strong>in the deck summary</strong>.  Step 1: All you need to do the combo is <a data-name=""Ready Fusion"">Ready Fusion</a> and any normal summonable monster. Step 2: You must special summon <a data-name=""Allvain the Essence of Vanity"">Allvain the Essence of Vanity</a> and normal summon a monster. Step 2: Link summon <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> and activate its effect. Step 3: Summon <a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a> from deck using Halqifibrax effect. Step 4: Make <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado"">Mecha Phantom Beast Aurorado</a>n +3 tokens and Summon Deskbot 001 using it's effect. Step 4: Synchro summon <a data-name=""Shooting Riser Dragon"">Shooting Riser Dragon</a> using 2 tokens and Deskbot 001. With Shooting riser's effect you must send a level 2 monster to the grave for the next step of the combo. (Ex: <a data-name=""PSY-framegear Gamma"">PSY-framegear Gamma</a>). Step 5: Synchro Summon <a data-name=""Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon"">Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon</a> and PROFIT. The combo can continue in many paths from here but for the sake of efficiency I will end it here.  Siding: You may side <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> into backrow heavy decks or decks that make a stong turn one board. <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and the other sided fusion monsters may also be good into certain first turn board decks. <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> is good into hand trap decks but locks you out of your bread and butter combo.  Notes: If you want to make this deck 100% TCG I would recommend a second copy of Allvain. If it's more readily available in the future, <a data-name=""Master Flare Hyperion"">Master Flare Hyperion</a> can be used as an alternative to <a data-name=""Baroness De Fleur"">Baroness De Fleur.</a>"

This can be an OTK but will never be a FTK. All XYZ monsters are rank 10 as you can use the Eldlich’s to recycle themselves for lots of monsters. good against meta decks and any decks with negates. This deck is not cheap, I will tell you now. This deck has been called “A B*tch Deck” before. So, if you want to upset people with a deck, then try this one."

I choose Gizmek for my deck, since I can't figure out how to play this deck, pls send help.  Gizmek got recently new support, but it didn't make the deck much better. Historically Gizmeks have seen success in Gren Maju otk decks and as an engine to go into VFD in Zefra. (For all that I know about)  My attempt is the classy Halq combo combined with some other Crystron plays.  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. : O )  Have a nice day, everyone!"

This is how the King duels!,"This is my current build for Red Dragon Archfiend, Resonators, Red Supernova Dragon turbo, whatever you want to call it. The idea of the deck is to get to our Synchro Monsters as consistently as possible, using Resonators and our Level 4 Monsters to Synchro Summon Red Rising Dragon, then bringing back a Resonator with its effect to use the two Monsters to Synchro Summon once more. The main gameplan is as follows: Special Summon Crimson Resonator with its effect, followed by Normal Summoning a Level 4 Monster, preferably Witch of the Black Forest, or Special Summoning Wandering King Wildwind. Then, Synchro Summon Red Rising Dragon, and use its effect to bring back Crimson Resonator. Use Crimson Resonator's effect to Special Summon two Resonators from our deck whose Levels add up to 4 (preferably Synkron Resonator and Creation Resonator for reasons I'll go into later, but two Red Resonators also works) and use our three Resonators and Red Rising Dragon to Synchro Summon this deck's strongest Monster, Red Supernova Dragon. Red Supernova Dragon combats many Monster-focused strategies by waiting to banish the opponent's field in just the right moment to remove problem cards and stop the opponent's plan in its tracks, and ending games quickly with its extremely high attack power.  The ideal Level 4 Monster to perform this setup with is Witch of the Black Forest. This is because she can search any Monster in our main deck after she's sent to the Graveyard, so using her in a Synchro Summon is excellent. In the above setup, using Crimson Resonator and Witch of the Black Forest to make Red Rising Dragon would allow us to search a Monster, such as Red Familiar. Then, using Synkron Resonator as one of the Tuners for Red Supernova Dragon allows us to add a Resonator from our Graveyard to our hand, such as the Creation Resonator we also used. Because Red Familiar can tribute itself to bring back a DARK Dragon Synchro from the Graveyard, and Banish itself to change that Synchro's Level, then combining it with the Creation Resonator (Special Summoned, assuming we still have Red Supernova Dragon) allows us to access most of our other Synchros, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss. In short, this means if we have Crimson Resonator and Witch of the Black Forest in our opening hand, we have the setup for not only Red Supernova Dragon, but also for another powerful Synchro Monster the following turn. Alternatively, if we open with Crimson Resonator, Red Familiar, and Wandering King Wildwind, we can achieve something similar by Special Summoning Crimson Resonator and Wandering King Wildwind with their respective effects, Synchro Summoning Red Rising Dragon and Red Supernova Dragon as normal, but then Normal Summoning Red Familiar and Special Summoning Creation Resonator. Tribute Red Familiar for its effect to bring back Red Rising Dragon, then use it and Creation Resonator to make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, similar to the above setup with Witch of the Black Forest, but on the same turn we Summon Red Supernova Dragon. Regardless, when Abyss deals battle damage we can bring back Synkron Resonator and make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane. This would normally deprive us of Abyss's amazing negation effect for the following turn, but Synkron Resonator lets us add Creation Resonator back to our hand once more, which we can then Special Summon and tribute for Bane's effect to bring back Abyss. Afterwards the main use of Bane will be using it to make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity, either through Bane's own effect, or, if we have two level 1 Resonators in the GY already, we can use Red Rising Dragon to bring them back and make King Calamity before the Battle Phase. This is the general gameplan, of the deck, but Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons and Void Ogre Dragon, provided we can empty our hand of cards, provide a solid backup plan for different scenarios.  Unfortunately, there will be times where we don't have Crimson Resonator available, despite having three copies of it and three copies of the two cards we can use to search it (Resonator Call and Resonator Command) in which case we need to improvise. If Red Resonator is available, along with a Level 4 Monster, we can still go into Red Rising Dragon, but you'll have to stop on a Level 8 Synchro, being Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend, or Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon, as neither Void Ogre Dragon nor Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons can be summoned this way. (Both require a DARK Tuner). Scarlight is good for clearing the field or simply being ""Red Dragon Archfiend"", while Chaos Ruler can be more helpful going first as it can dig through the deck to help further our plays next turn, or ideally, find a Synkron Resonator we can use to make Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, the ideal monster to have if Red Supernova Dragon isn't an option. If not, we may be forced to fall back on Samsara, Dragon of Rebirth, or Black Rose Moonlight Dragon, or, the worst case scenario, nothing at all. This is where we get into the deck's weaknesses; if we can't Synchro Summon on our first turn, there isn't really anything we can do. It's tempting to add Link Monsters to circumvent this, but I couldn't find any that were good enough to justify the space they'd take, and even if we decided to run the Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon engine, it would hurt the deck's consistency and we wouldn't even always be able to have two Monsters we could Summon to make Predaplant Verte Anaconda anyway. Another issue is the deck struggles to play through hand traps; Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence in particular can stop us in our tracks, leaving us on a Red Rising Dragon we can't do anything with. Fortunately, this is something we can address with Called by the Grave, which we include in the Main Deck to give us a shot at shutting these cards down. The final weakness worth mentioning is the deck doesn't have much for dealing with Spells and Traps, though Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss, Infinite Impermanence, and Red Reign can help circumvent this, as can the Side Deck.  The Side Deck contains two six-card packages: a Kaiju package, and a Crossout Designator package. The idea here is we can decide which one we need, and take out the same six cards from the Main Deck for either one; the three Red Sprinters, the two Resonator Engines, and the one Chain Resonator. This is the most painless way I've been able to think of to fit these packages in without hurting the deck's consistency too much. The Crossout Designator package is designed for combating hand traps, specifically Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring, Effect Veiler, and Ghost Belle and Haunted Mansion. These are the ones that I've found tend to foil our plans the most, but Nibiru, the Primordial Being, is also a significant threat. Depending on the current climate of the game it may be wise to use that to replace one of the other targets. In fact, in some contexts it might be better to simply have this package in the Main Deck by default, but as this is a non-meta deck I've designed it with the assumption it will usually be used against other non-meta decks, which may or may not be using hand traps at all. The Kaiju engine, however, is simple enough to use, as its main purpose is simply monster removal when going second. However, in this deck specifically there's enough possible interactions that I think it's worth going into in more detail. I've always been fond of Kaijus, as unlike most other outs to dangerous cards, Kaiju Monsters can interact with the rest of your deck in fun ways, with their varied Types, Levels, and Attributes. This deck plays Dogoran, the Mad Flame Kaiju, Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju, and Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju, along with three Interrupted Kaiju Slumber, as a package to clear out problematic Monsters and possibly enable our Synchro Monsters in one swoop. For example, if we use Interrupted Kaiju Slumber to give ourselves Dogoran and our opponent Gameciel, we can Banish a Red Rising Dragon in the Graveyard to Special Summon two Level 1 Resonators from our Graveyard and use those along with Dogoran to Synchro Summon Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend, or if we have Radian we can use a single Level 1 Resonator to make a Level 8 Synchro Monster. Of course, we can also keep our Kaiju on the field as means of preventing our opponent from using their own Kaijus to out our Synchro Monsters, particularly Red Supernova Dragon. As for the three Lightning Storm, they're a good safe option if we expect to go second and don't think either the two six-card packages are necessary, in which case we simply side out Chain Resonator and the Resonator Engines.  This deck is subject to change and improvement. It's currently my main focus as far as Yu-Gi-Oh is concerned.

I wanted to make a Cybernetic Horizon-less build because that card kills the deck with its Extra Deck lock into Machines (seriously Konami what's the point of stopping Cyberdarks from accessing Verte Anaconda and Buster Whelp?? And you didn't even release a good Link or fusion spell to make up for it. I hate you). It's a simple build really, similar decks already exist, I just swapped handtraps for extenders. It's still not rogue tier but is better than what Konami calls 'Cyber Style', in my opinion.  *This deck has lots of starters and extenders and can actually play through interruptions, except Droll &amp; Lock, Dimensional Shifter and Nibiru. But depending on your hand you should be able to make Dragoon anyway, as opposite to the ""Cyber Style"" build which just dies.  *Dragoon is sadly not only way better than Cyberdarkness and Dark End, but also easily accessible so there is no point in not using it -- best win condition of the deck. What does Dragoon gain from protecting Cyberdarks? Well for starters, the buster lock completely invalidates Super Polymerization. And the resource recycling game pretty much guarantees Dragoon will always have something to discard. Plus Cyberdarks add lots of destruction removal so it's not like they do nothing  *The second win condition is the Cyberdark themselves equipped with Dragon Buster Destruction Sword. Try to equip it with Cyberdark Invasion rather than with the effect of the Cyberdark itself; this way, the little dragon will stay equipped even if Keel, Edge and Horn get their effects negated. Even without Dragon Buster, the Cyberdark trio can hold their own with Invasion and Inferno support  *Magicians' Souls lets you draw into your extenders to make Link plays and is a prime Link material itself. It can also fix your hand in a pitch. Send the equips to gain easy card advantage over your opponent. Shuffle REF back in the deck with Illusion of Chaos.  *Add Revsystem with Core when your starting hand lacks extenders.  *Ningirsu The Wold Chalice Warrior should be put over Fossil Warrior Skull Knight to out some troublesome cards but eh, I never needed it so far. BLS + Pegasus + Megafleet should be enough.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Making a dinosaur trap control deck is a little bit ambitious with the fact that they float, giving them the go ahead with torrential, support traps, letting them play a ton of cards, are Dinos which you get why, misc and tons of searchers, have no regard for life points giving them more traps, particularly rebirth for a free summon of a counter trap searcher, arc rebellion shake, and even enabling cyber stein as an extremely viable option!  That’s what I played in this build but there’s more, below is some ideas that I had  &nbsp;  Playing primarily on opponents turn and built in such a way you can run the dogmatika engine shaddoll winda engine as well.  Play with sky strikers.  Dragoon turbo, it’s stupid but effective  Play floodgates, they can just do that  Combine with a lot of midrange decks that are capable of pumping out bosses every turn and still sitting behind traps  Play with Paleozoic, I think you can understand this one  Run so many different kinds of cards for generic searchers  eldlich, because people are somehow managing to shove eldlich into anything  ns alister, for instant content  buster blader lock with counter traps be like  True king actually works here  lost world will trigger these guys floating effects apparently  Evil eye helps you reach your goal  when under 2000 LP you don’t have to pay the cost for ANY trap, if I’m correct then imperial order won’t ever be able to leave but this one I could be wrong on.  This archetype is actually too good, Konami why did you make this? This was written way too poorly, they float, protect from damage, and do everything you could ask for from a control deck and stun deck combine.  What this deck is capable of doing is easily meta potential."

This is why Needlefibre needs to be banned. Okay, Auroradon is actually a card you could maybe hit instead, or you could be stupid and ban Deskbot and every other Tuner Needlefibre can summon, but broken stuff keeps popping up with Needlefibre.  So, this is a shell for that combo. So why this combo, and why this shell? Well for starters, the combo is real. Yes, it can lose to handtraps - in fact you're doing literally everything the most common hand traps hit, searching, summoning, summoning from the GY, activating effects from the GY, activating effects on the field, even making tokens - the combo requires you to dodge or play through hand traps. This is exacerbated by playing Dinosaur, since 1 Lancea is a huge swing in the matchup. Crossout helps but isn't perfect. But the reward for taking that risk is real, a couple serious boss monsters and Herald, which is an omni-negate and a floodgate. And Lost World helps a lot by protecting your monsters from targeting.  So why Dinosaur for this combo? As mentioned above there are cons, mainly that you now lose to basically every hand trap if you don't draw Crossout. Well, the reason is partially for consistency, and partially for power, and partially to mitigate the risks of the combo. It does none of these exceptionally well, but it does all of them well enough. Running 3 Rotas and 3 starters means you're more likely to put up the start without running excess bricks or multiple 1 card Needlefibre packages. Running Lost World helps mitigate the inherent weakness to hand traps. You can also just make Dinosaur plays in the event of hand traps, and my basic mentality when it comes to dinosaur is consistent UTCs are pretty good. That means we have nice consistent 1 card starts, and Babycerasaurus or Petiteranodon + Archosaur will also start you into the combo, so we have multiple ways into it with cards we want to see. Also, Jurrac Aeolo isn't really a brick - not only is it not a Garnet, it isn't a Taketemborg either, since seeing it alongside Oviraptor is the exact same result as seeing Oviraptor + Babycerasaurus, one of your common starts (you can Rota for. That means we can keep it down to 1 Garnet and 2 Taketemborg. Just don't draw Coltwing and you'll be fine. It is also powerful, since you can easily fill those 2 remaining monster zones with good high-quality interruptions in UTC and Pankratops.  So, I started by putting in the bricks and the combo. I hadn't even decided on Dinosaur at that point, I was just looking at easy 1 card Needlefibres and trying to find a home. That became Dinosaur because of Oviraptor, Fossil Dig, and Misc. Misc doesn't really help with the combo the way Lost World does, but it is good nonetheless. Jurrac Aeolo was my next card, a necessary card for going into Needlefibre, but again not really a brick so much as a combo piece. 3 Lost World and 1 Terraforming, this is a big part of the reason to play the combo in this deck. I put in 1 Giant Rex, because you can still make some ordinary Dino plays and the deck wouldn't feel right without him. Sometimes, your combo gets interrupted and you've got to have a backup plan. 2 Archosaur and 2 Pill. You do want to see these, there just isn't space to run 3 each. 3 Babycerasaurus because it is strictly better than Petiteranodon in this deck, but I still want 2 Petiteranodon so you'll occasionally see this and get an extra Pankratops off of your UTC. 2 Tyranno, this is typically your 4th interruption throughout your normal combos, and it is your main back-up plan. Good to see, good to search, good to summon off of pill. 3 Prosperity. This does sort of kill a lot of your backup plans, but all of your main cards leave just about 6 spaces of ""filler"" and I think having that consistency boost is important. It is also Ash bait, which is really its main purpose, since we're vulnerable to a well-timed Ash. 1 Pankratops, this is a good going second card, but it is also the 5th interruption you put up with Petiteranodon or Pill. You need another high-level monster to summon in your combo. I mean, need is going a little far, but it definitely helps. I like filling all of my monster zones. The rest of the deck is Crossout and random 1 ofs that disrupt the combo if timed right.  This deck goes through the usual Auroradon / Cupid Pitch combo to put up Baroness + Savage + Herald, with Auroradon in the extra monster zone. However, if you have a Baby in your hand or start with a Archosaur + Baby, or just have Pill or UTC in your hand, you add a UTC to that board. You can search UTC to make that even more consistent, and will sometimes add a Pankratops to that board, either by using pill when you have UTC or popping Petiteranodon with UTC. You run 1 Barricadeborg Blocker just to clear up zones so that you can use the Archosaur, Linkuriboh into Secure Gardna for more easy UTCs, and Dollka and Laggia as mascots. For my final cards, I went with I:P into Goddess for a going first option, and Lyna into Accesscode for a going second option, but these slots could be anything and are basically banish fodder (you decide whether you need Dolka/Laggia or Linkuriboh/Gardna).  Getting real LinkFibre era vibes from this combo. One plan I considered was running more Backrow, and the Solemn Judgment in the side deck still seem good, especially vs DRNM, but I felt the combo loses to hand traps badly enough that Crossout was obligatory in the main.  Reprodocus has become the generic link 2 of choice, because it being a Dinosaur is relevant for some hands. I cut Giant Rex. In this combo-focused version it became another brick we couldn't afford. One notable thing about the deck is you can use Baroness to pop the Jurraegg token to summon Pankratops before you make the Herald. So you're using Baroness's pop to get an extra spell-speed 2 interruption."

It's mostly solved now so I felt like posting the decklist that I use. This deck has great ability to play through cards and can catch people off guard. The win condition is to make your opponent waste resources and then decimate them on turn 2. Sorry if the text is weird in some places, it won't let me put the names of the spells.  <strong>@Ignister monsters -</strong>  Bururu @Ignister (1) - Searchable by cyberse wicckid. Foolishes a card (usually your negate, or something to be revived by splash mage for a meet you only hand), then when used as synchro material you can special summon the other monster used as material. Very important for combo, but is searchable and doesn't help otherwise.  Pikari @Ignister (3) - Starter, searches any AI spell or trap, which is incredibly useful. No reason not to play at 3. Plus it makes light dragon which is funny sometimes.  Achichi @Ignister (3) - It's Stratos.  Doyon @Ignister (3) - This card is absolutely nuts. When it's summoned, you can add 1 of your monsters from your grave to your hand, which is great for the field spell's gimmick. And that's not all - When it's sent to the graveyard as link material for a cyberse monster, you can add 1 of your A I. s/t from your graveyard to your hand. It's both achichi and pikari in one if your graveyard is loaded, which is why i play 3 and not 2. Drawing it is ALWAYS good.  Danmari @Ignister (1) - banish from grave for HRDAA negate while you have arrival. Sent during combo.  Gatchiri @Ignister (1) - Negate the effects of one Cyberse monster you control to special summon it. When it's sent to the graveyard, you can give your cards immunity. Nice for making safe plays, plus protects on board as well. Great for 8300 attack unaffected accesscode.  Hiyari @Ignister (1) - Free special summon if you control an @Ignister monster, searches gatchiri by tributing one.  <strong>Engine Spells - </strong>  AI. Meet You (3)- LOCKS INTO CYBERSE EFFECTS! (Search by revealing an ED monster. Deals 2300 burn to you if you didn't special summon the monster you revealed). At 3 because you can still do combo off of starting with it.  Ignister AILand - (3+Terraforming) The focus of the deck. Special summons a mon from hand while there's nothing in your MMZ. Can come back from graveyard by its effect.  Cynet Mining - (3) More copies of starters. Can send combo pieces to GY sometimes.  AIdle Reborn - (2) Is a quickplay monster reborn. Can use on opponent's turn and then link off doyon to use it again, going very high in card advantage. Also can be helpful to extend.  AIContact - (0-1) Spicy draw 3 if you open an extra AILand. Can recycle it to go to the moon in card advantage.  <strong>Extra Deck -</strong>  Accesscode Talker(1) - I think you know why.  The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister- (1) The big man.  Transcode Talker (1)- Summons a link-3 or lower in your GY. Used on turn 2+ to go for a push  Update Jammer (1)- Makes OTK with Accesscode  Splash Mage (2) - Amazing card for cyberse, reborns any cyberse monster in defense position.  Cyberse Wicckid (1) - I love this card. Searches a tuner when a monster is summoned in a zone it points to, and offers protection to itself and monsters it points to. Sometimes you just pass on this guy and call it a day.  Dark Infant @Ignister (3) - Link 1, searches field spell. That's all you need to know.  Fire Phoenix @Ignister (1) - This card is only there for Meet You, it's 2300 and fire.  Dark Templar @Ignister (1) - Very important part of your combo, protect mr. soul charge at all costs.  Link Spider (1) - Solid rocks brother. Turns nib into a cyberse.  Light Dragon @Ignister (1) - Meet You, plus it can wipe a few cards off of your opponent's board.  Wind Pegasus @Ignister (1) - Synchro monster for Bururu, plus if your arrival gets removed, your opponent's monster gets removed.  &nbsp;  <em>Everything else in the deck is flex spots. Your hand traps are important, as that is how you apply pressure with your Arrival Cyberse. Not hooked on crossout for this deck yet, as resolving combo doesn't mean instant win. I don't have combos on here right now, but you should be able to find the most important ones pretty easily. It's all for the same endboard anyways.</em>"

Spam draws and special summons ~synchro into Boardefly activate it effect ~use De-Synchro to bring Boardefly materials back - summon Lightflare. If you got more De-Synchro you can do more loop and add Moonflowerviewing in the combo for more draw power.  Pot of Avarice may be a good idea for the main deck but i didn't found space for it.  The side deck is irrelevant so i added some prision and trishula stuff to fill it.  GLHF

Ive been playing this Deck for quite a while now so heres how it works: Your general gameplan is to get 1x Gouki monster + at least 1 extender in hand.  You almost always want to normal summon your Gouki and then play further with your extenders like ""War Rock Gactos"" or ""Fire Flint Lady"" which guarantee you the Isolde. When you summon Isolde your Chaining is essential. You always want to use your Gouki, which you send for her summon, as Chain Link 1 and the Isolde as Chain Link 2.  For the searches you get of these two the optimal options are to add a ""Gouki Headbatt"" from the Gouki and whatever Gouki you used for Isoldes summon through the search you get of Isolde. We add the Gouki we used already by Isolde so we have a material for Headbatt, since he needs to discard a Gouki Monster to be special summoned. After this you wanna use Isolde to either get your ""Gouki Twistcobra""(3 equip spells needed in Deck) ,""Gouki Octostretch"" (1 equip spells needed in Deck) or ""Gouki Guts"" (1 equip spells needed in Deck). This should leave you with 3 Monsters on Board. The Isolde in the Extra Monster Zone, the Monster you summoned of Isolde and the headbatt you summoned trough its effect. Then you go into a Link 4 with these Monsters for the ""Saryuja Skull Dread"" and then add a Gouki Rematch to your hand. You'll use this rematch to summon back 2 Goukis (be carefull not to summon your Isolde target) and then start the codebreaker combo. This will give you enough materials for a Rusty and leave you with a Link-3 Monster as well. You'll use the Rusty to dumb the silent cloak and set the Shade Brigandine, the you activate the brigandine and banish the cloak to add a boots to hand which you can special to your side. You can then go into a Gryphon or an Apolusa (depending on if you fear the late Nibiru). IF you decide to go for Gryphon remember to first of: Add Phoenix Blade back to hand Seccondly: To use Brigandine for its Summon.  Then you can, if you have no more extenders, end your Turn by summoning a Verte Anaconda and using its effect to summon a Dragoon to your side (remember to summon it in a Zone where a Link monster Points to, if you Summoned a Gryphon) and banish the silent boots for a Fog Blade.  This is your basic bread and butter combo which will leave you with 2 Monster negates trough Apolousa, 1 trough Fog Blade and one Omni negate trough the Dragoon.  Of course, the Deck can play trough the multitude of engines, like the striker engine, in many different ways on your turn, based on of what you draw.  Here are a few combo specific plays:  If you draw Engage or Hornet Drones: You activate it to summon the token. Then you go into the Kagari to add back the Hornet drones, and reactivate it. Then you summon the Kaina by using the Kagari as Material for the Summon. Trough that you have a Link zone and a Warrior Monster. This gives you even with one extender enough room to do your combo or more.  War Rock Gacta : You have to normal summon a warrior to trigger his summoning condition. Thats about it  On another note: If you dont want to use Dragoon just play 3x War Rock Mountains instead of the Dragoon engine, since it searches you the Gacta which serves as an extender.  Pros of the Deck: Many options to get to your Combo pieces Space in the Extra Deck  Cons: Very Vulnerable to Handtraps and/or negates in general"
