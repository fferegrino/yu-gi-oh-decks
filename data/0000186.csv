The main strategy of the deck is to activate Cynet Codec and basically abuse the card to search all of the cards you need to combo with. You will mostly want to search the cards that can special summon for the hand fairly easily. For Earth, search Gatchiri, Wing search Link-infra Flier, ect. You can find combo guides and other deck profiles on Youtube but I wanted to share my own build here. I play 0 handtraps bc it is easier to get the pieces of the combo you need just by drawing into them. Also you want to play the deck going 1st and generally try to make a U-Board with Iblee on the opponents field and Salamangreat Sanctuary active which would lock them into only link monsters but the zones are taken so they basically can't do anything. The only way to get Iblee off of the field is for your opponent to either tribute it or use Dark Hole, or negate its effects or something of the sort."

El ángel de la muerte ha vuelto para lle","Deck creado por: Darklab

<strong>Objetivo:</strong> Invocar a Angel of Mischief usando a Utopia con muchos materiales para ganar el duelo! &gt;w&lt;

<strong>Link a la demostración del Deck:</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  https://youtu.be/QfcdK5eXHiw  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

<strong>Requisitos para iniciar el combo:</strong>

Para iniciar el combo sólo necesitaremos invocar a Isolde. Para eso hay muchísimas cartas que nos ayudarán a hacerlo. Si tenemos suerte, sólo hará falta 1 carta!

<strong>Extenders para invocar a Isolde</strong><strong>:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Neo Space Connector: </strong>Con esto no hará falta nada más, adicionalmente, al traer a Dolphin, podremos encargarnos de una handtrap.</li>
 	<li><strong>Marauding Captain: </strong>Sirve junto con otro guerrero en mano.</li>
 	<li><strong>Junk Forward: </strong>Se invoca gratis si no controlamos monstruos.</li>
 	<li><strong>Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin:</strong> Es una Normal Summon bastante decente (ver Connector)</li>
 	<li><strong>Fire Flint Lady: </strong>Se invoca gratis si controlamos otro guerrero.</li>
 	<li><strong>Blue Mountain Butterspy: </strong>Se invoca gratis cuando invocamos otro guerrero. Ojo con el timing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Kagemucha knight:</strong> Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales: </strong>Manda al Cementerio a Cloak, que añade a la mano a Boots, quien se invoca gratis.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine: </strong>Es un cuerpo gratis. Ojo que no cuenta para el Phoenix Blade, así que tendremos que descartar el guerrero que nos da Isolde para seguir con el combo.</li>
 	<li><b>Reinforcement of the army: </b>Trae a cualquier guerrero.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Deck bastante consistente. Incluso si roba un garnet, es posible devolverlo con Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>
 	<li>El deck no depende del burn, por lo que no es afectado por incrementos de LP del oponente.</li>
 	<li>El deck tiene muy pocos garnets (6).</li>
 	<li>Puede baitear hantraps con los extenders suficientes.</li>
 	<li>Versátil. Es fácil adaptarse a distintos recursos en mano.</li>
 	<li>El deck tiene acceso a protección como Sauravis y Dragged Down into the Grave.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Contras:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>El deck requiere de varios pasos específicos para lograrse, si alguno no se realiza correctamente, uno puede bloquearse.</li>
 	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, si se roba 2 Garnets, será gg.</li>
 	<li>El deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Called by the grave y Ghost Belle, al igual que a Veiler e Impermanence si los usan correctamente.</li>
 	<li>A pesar de tener burn infinito, sigue perdiendo ante Ghost Sister.</li>
</ul>"

The original idea was to go for an affordable Sky Striker deck that would hold it's own against meta decks, but eventually I started to get my hands on staples and other higher value cards through lucky pulls and trades. The main strategy here is going second with the goal being to disrupt your opponent during their turn, break their boards and get your resource cycle going. Link Hayate, poke for damage and send Engage, grab engage with Kagari and search for whatever Sky Striker tool you need, link to Shizuku and grab Multirole to start recycling resources as you need them."

End your first turn on a couple of monsters and the link with at least a handtrap or two to stop your opponent. This deck also has a going second option that may be better for this format.

The scales help you summon monsters up to Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon and you can switch them by special summoning Pendulum Sorcerer. Most of the Times i use Pend Sorcerer to bring one scale 1 or 8 and Skullcrobat Joker and by normal summoning Joker i can get another scale 1 or 8 depending on what i previously searched.

This is an alteration of my original list, submitted yesterday, which brings in a bit more interaction in-place of main deck card draw. It does also employ the red-eyes fusion package to accelerate out R-EDD, along with a reduction in Comic Hand to add more trap interaction. I'm still trying to decide if main deck Ash is a good move, especially since I've introduced the Toon trap package now--only play-testing will determine that."

The ""Fast &amp; Furious"" movies have reached another milestone. With number 9 rolling in cinemas, the popular action franchise has become the 5th most lucrative film series of all time! <a>https://architizer.com/firms/the-journey-anime/</a>

The total revenue for all the movies (including the spin-off ""Hobbs &amp; Shaw"") now amounts to 6.29 billion dollars, writes MovieWeb. Revenues for ""Fast &amp; Furious 9"" are expected to tick up this summer when the film is released in more and more countries (it will have its Swedish premiere on July 14). <a>https://outof.cards/hearthstone/decks/27543-the-mat</a>

""Fast &amp; Furious"" thus beats the ""X-Men"" franchise, which has earned just over $ 6 billion spread over a total of 13 films (this also includes ""Logan"" and ""Deadpool"")."

Get tribute fodder, summon Slifer, opponent cant summon anything with 0 or ","Purpose of the deck, get tribute fodder on the field and summon Slifer. Its a fun deck that isn't perfect (can brick a little sometimes). A lot of people on here could make it better and stronger by throwing in more meta cards like hand traps and such but this deck is designed for fun using God support cards, God themed typed cards or cards similar to the cards used in the anime by characters who summon the God cards (Reactor Slime/Egyptian God Slime for example).

&nbsp;

The point of the deck is get tribute fodder (mostly tokens) on the board and get Slifer in your hand using spell cards or through the draw power and then lock your opponent out of summoning &lt;2k monsters as your hand builds up and Slifer becomes a massive beat stick.

Below is a quicks breakdown of the deck and why they are used:

<strong>1 x Obelisk:</strong> is thrown in because its only God that has built in protection and increase odds of you getting a God in your hand since just 3 Slifer isn't enough. Other monster's are pretty self explanatory.

<strong>3 x Reactor Slime:</strong> for its token effect and ability's to bring Metal Reflect Slimed on the field, which is then used for Egyptian God Slime.

<strong>3 x Ra's Disciple:</strong> gets another 2 and if you got a god and Advance Draw (combo this with The True Name), you'll get a God out on your turn or use Soul Crossing during your opponents turn, tribute their monster's and you then keep a few ready for another god to come out later.

<strong>3 x Scapeghost:</strong> is slow being a flip effect, but if it Flips, BOOM! 4 monsters....cant say no to that.

<strong>1 x Vanitys Ruler:</strong> because why not (can easily be taken out if don't like as the deck is at 41) Another tribute summon option with a good effect. Doesn't need to be here but fun if he is

For the spell cards I've quickly explained above the combo of Card Advance and The True Name and the usage of Soul Crossing.

<strong>2 x Thunderforce Attack:</strong> Doesnt need to be at 3, easily a brick card early game but good enough to utilize for its destructive power on opponents turn, or its destructive and draw power if used on your turn. plus its a Slifer card so why not.

<strong>2 x Mound of Bound Creator + 1 x Terraforming:</strong> Extra protection for Slifer, plus using a Terraforming to get one to hand thins the deck (Can easily be taken and replaced if wish for hand traps or other cards you might prefer)

<strong>3 x Supply Squad:</strong> If you don't get a God, and your tokens are just a line of defense, this works quite nicely just to help get to Slifer or other cards. Especially fun when have 2 or all 3 copies out (if they don't get destroyed ofc)

<strong>1 x Scapegoat:</strong> Play during opponents turn, use them for link bait (hence the Link-1s and 2s in Extra Deck)

<strong>1 x Upstart Goblin:</strong> Thin deck

The Monster Reborn, HFD and MST are there for the back row destruction and free special summon. These can easily be changed if you want for stronger/better/preferred cards, I use them cos I like them and when I paly casually with friends, back row is used quite a lot (plus HFD was in the Structure Deck, i enjoy the nostalgia)

For Traps:

<strong>3 x Reckless Greed:</strong> used for more hand size and getting a Slifer in hand. Best played in conjunction with another copy of its self making it worth the loss of a draw phase for 2 turns. Combos nicely with Supply Squad as that allows you to draw as your tokens are maybe getting destroyed whilst you Reckless is stopping you drawing so you don't real feel the draw back as much.

<strong>2 x Metal Reflect Slime:</strong> in here for Reactor Slime effect and to get Egyptian God Slime out. Doesn't need to be at 3 cos Reactor Slime can get it from Graveyard and tbh could easily be a 1, but its a card I've always loved and I have 2 Ultimate rare copies so thought might as well use both. Can be reduced to 1 and throw in cards you'd like to use but its still a nice 3k DEF monster if used from hand.

The Extra deck revolves around

<strong>2 x Egyptian God Slime:</strong> 3k beat stick, offer protection to other things and can be sued as 3 tributes for Gods. He is the sub-boss monster of the deck. Bring out using the Reactor and metal Reflect Slime combo mentioned previously

<strong>Links:</strong> The link-1s and 2s are in here to be used in conjunction with Scapegoat and if they allow, for use with other tokens and monster's so your deck can possibly do something if all 3 Slifer's are hiding at the bottom of your deck. If you wanna use this build my links are probably not the best choice so they can all be changed for better cards or better choices, I'm just using the cards I have. Just ensure whatever link monster's you pick, tokens can be used to summon them and that you have enough Link1s/2s so you can have at least 3 link monster's on field to make full use of Scapegoat's effect.

&nbsp;

Hope everyone has fun trying out my build, suggestions welcome. To be honest you could alter this build and make it Obelisk, just replace the Slifer specific cards with Obelisk and his specific cards. If your looking for a cheap build the money card in this is Egyptian God Slime its cocsltys roughly £20+ last I checked in UK (Not inc Black Luster but he's actually a proxy in my physical deck) so you can take him out and leave Reactor Slime and Metal Reflect in as their effects are still good and Metal Reflect has 3k DEF so not easy to power past."

This is the base strategy.

&nbsp;

Play Numeron Network and either use its effect to activate or activate Numeron Calling from your hand. Summon all 4 Numeron XYZ monsters for the extra deck. Then you can activate Memories of Hope to draw 4 cards for free. Then you use the 4 Numeron XYZ monsters to summon Saryuja Skull Dread. Then activate its effect to draw 4 cards and the shuffle 3 back into the deck. Then you can activate Link Bound and draw 4 cards to shuffle 4 back into the deck. Don't worry if you don't have Exodia. There are many more ways than this to draw from your deck."

This deck is more of a nostalgia deck for people who are looking to get back into the game casually and want to play newer versions of old cards. This deck goes first to end on ""At Best"" an <strong>Arcana Knight Joker</strong>, an <strong>Arcana Extra Joker</strong>, and 1<strong> Thunderspeed Summon</strong> which will summon <strong>Sphere Mode</strong>. This is only if you draw literally the god hand going first as your end board is usually only 1 of those 3.</span>

<span>First the poker knights: 1 <strong>Jack's Knight</strong>, 3 <strong>Queen's Knight</strong>, and 3 <strong>King's Knight</strong>. 3 <strong>Arcana Triumph Joker</strong> which is a horrible card going first while decent going second since she could've been a quick effect and nobody would've cared. She is a nice discard since you can summon her from grave using her own effect later on in the duel. 3 <strong>Joker's Knight</strong> who foolishes a poker knight to summon himself as a body with the same name. He can be used for <strong>Arcana Knight</strong> and <strong>Extra Joker</strong>. 3 <strong>Imperial Bower</strong> which is literally <strong>Rescue Rabbit</strong>. 3 <strong>Sphere Mode</strong> is the god I chose to maindeck since <strong>Thunderspeed</strong> doesn't have the <strong>Soul Exchange Effect</strong> that<strong> Soul Crossing</strong> has and it can search <strong>Sphere Mode</strong> on top of that since you can either choose to have 3 poker knights on field or use them for <strong>Arcana Knight</strong>/<strong>Extra Joker</strong>. 1 <strong>Fire Flint Lady</strong> for either an extender or fusion material for <strong>Gilti-Gearfried</strong>.</span>

<span>1 <strong>ROTA</strong>. 3 <strong>Fusion Deployment</strong> which is <strong>E Tele</strong> for any poker knight. 3 <strong>Unexpected Dai</strong> which unfortunately clashes with Imperial Bower, but you have no way of searching Bower so it's rarely a problem. Only 1<strong> Face Card Fusion</strong> since your only fusions can only negate things that ""TARGET"" themselves. 3 <strong>Joker's Straight</strong> which is literally begging to be negated since it essentially gives you 3 bodies in the 3 poker knights. 3 <strong>Extrav</strong>. 3 <strong>Thunderspeed Summon</strong>. 3 <strong>Joker's Wild</strong> which copies one of your poker knight spells. Something to consider about the spell/trap lineup is that you can choose to run things like<strong> Pot of Avarice</strong>. All of the new support takes almost all copies of your poker knights out of the deck turn 1 so you have no follow-up if you draw something like <strong>Joker's Straight</strong> or <strong>Joker's Wild</strong>. You need some way to put your materials back into the deck to actually use your cards in later turns.</span>

<span>Extra Deck is an <strong>Extrav</strong> build. 3 <strong>Arcana Knight Joker</strong>, 3 <strong>Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos</strong>, 3 <strong>Arcana Extra Joker</strong>, and 3<strong> Link Spider</strong>. 3 <strong>Gilti-Gearfried the Magical Steel Knight</strong>. It is simply <strong>Arcana Knight Joker</strong> combined with <strong>Bad Aim</strong> that can also attack twice and has relatively generic fusion materials.</span>

<span>Side Deck is just cards you can consider running. <strong>Obelisk</strong> cannot be targeted and with how easy it is to get monsters on the field in this deck, you can also tribute 2 monsters to<strong> Raigeki</strong> your opponent. <strong>Slifer</strong> is literally a floodgate that gets rid of normal summons and starting plays. <strong>Soul Crossing</strong> is insane if you open it and a god. Going second, consider breaking boards with <strong>Dark Ruler</strong> and spell/trap removal like <strong>Twin Twisters</strong> or something of that sort.</span>"

Strategy is to use Scapeghost, Nimble monsters, and tokens to keep your board full of monsters until you can draw, or search Obelisk or Slifer (or have in hand already).

This Magnet Warrior Deck operates a lot like most present day Cyberse Decks, the only difference being that it is made up of Rock-types (because Rock-types need love too).

The Deck offers mediocre swarming potential which allows it to easily crank out the Level 8 ""Magna Warrior"" monsters from the Main Deck and a lot of the offensive threats present in the Extra Deck.

The Deck also has a lock down mode, where you'll want to have the following cards on the field (note that although this field IS achievable, it requires a couple turns of set-up):
<ul>
 	<li>Monsters: Knightmare Griphon (who must be linked to as many of your monsters as possible), Adamancipator Risen - Dragite, Gorgonic Guardian, and Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior.</li>
 	<li>Spells/Traps: Magnetic Field, and Triamid Pulse.</li>
</ul>
Knightmare Gryphon in the Main Monster Zone shuts down your opponent's Special Summoned monsters if they aren't linked, while protecting your own monsters, assuming it is linked to all of them. Adamancipator Risen - Dragite provides Spell/Trap negation as well as non-targeting and non-destroying removal of your opponent's cards. Gorgonic Guardian shuts down your opponent's monster effects and can eliminate defensive tokens (if you're into that). Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior adds extra coverage and is the only monster that can take advantage of Magnetic Field's secondary effects. Traimid Pulse let's you revive Adamancipator Risen - Dragite and Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior upon destruction (which works well with Magnetic Field), has the ability to recover Magnetic Field, and has the ability to destroy an opponent's card during their turn. Your opponent cannot do much in this situation with all of the limits brought forth, what more when the other capable monsters are brought forth?"

<strong>The History of Butter</strong>

Butter's origins go back about 10,000 years to the time when our ancestors first began domesticating animals. Today, butter in its many flavorful forms is the world's most popular fat. As a versatile spread, a delicious enhancer for so many foods, and the essential ingredient for baking, butter's simple goodness has no equal...

The first reference to butter in our written history was found on a 4,500-year-old limestone tablet illustrating how butter was made. It is generally believed the word butter originates from the <em>boutyron</em>, Greek for “cow cheese”, however it may have come from the language of cattle-herding Scythians.

&nbsp;

<strong>Butter</strong> is a <a>dairy product</a> containing up to 80% <a>butterfat</a> which is solid when chilled and at <a>room temperature</a>. It is made by <a>churning</a> fresh or <a>fermented</a> <a>cream</a> or <a>milk</a> to separate the butterfat from the <a>buttermilk</a>. Butter consists of <a>butterfat</a>, milk <a>proteins</a> and water.

&nbsp;

<strong>Unsalted Butter</strong>

This is your best bet for cooking and baking. For many recipes, it is recommended that you bring the butter to room temperature first so that it better incorporates with other ingredients. The exception is pie crust, for which cold butter is a must. If you wish, you can season unsalted butter yourself to meet your personal taste preferences when using it as a topping or spread.

&nbsp;

<strong>Clarified Butter</strong>

When butter is melted and made clear by separating and discarding the milk solids and water, it makes the perfect dipping sauce for shellfish and other seafood. But because it will not burn at high temperatures, it is also a good choice for frying and sautéing.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cultured Butter</strong>

Made from cultured cream, cultured butter has a rich, complex flavor. It is ideal for baking because the lower moisture content produces flakier pastries and fluffier cakes.

&nbsp;

<strong>European-Style Butter</strong>

This old-fashioned variation is made from cream that is churned more slowly and for a longer time. It has a butterfat content of at least 82 percent—higher than standard butter. The increased amount of butterfat is beneficial for cooking and baking.

&nbsp;

<strong>Whipped Butter</strong>

After it is churned, nitrogen gas is whipped into butter to create this soft, spreadable butter."

This is a suuuuuper fun deck i've been working on, the Harpies and Dragunity have massive synergy with each other, and Harpies are such a nostalgic archetype for me and so many other players, and they're actually pretty damn good, don't get me wrong, they're not a meta deck, but god damn they're a lot of fun (and also pretty cheap).

So, why Dragunity and Harpie? Wellllll, first off, I love Dragunity, but we all know what they're lacking. M̶a̶s̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶m̶o̶m̶m̶y̶ ̶m̶i̶l̶k̶e̶r̶s̶  Combo Starters. with this deck, Perfumer and Channeler (provided you have a discard) will give you full combo, plus more than often a few extenders. As well as this, <strong>HAVE YOU READ ANY HARPIE SPELL/TRAPS????????????</strong> Harpie's feather storm is literally a quick play dark ruler no more, and Hysteric Sign searches a free extender and is a block dragon in the end phase.  I'm not kidding.

So the general idea of this deck is to use elegant egotist and world chalice guardragon to spam out them vanilla harpie ladies, and make big link monsters, and then use your Dragunity monsters to put up synchro negates or big chunguses.

This deck was very much made with budget in mind, and accordingly, the most expensive card in the deck is harpie perfumer, that's right, you'll find no Noodles or Savage Dragons or Zeus or Dragoons in this deck.

Let me explain some of my card choices real quick, first of all, why Crystal Wing over Borreload Savage Dragon or any other synchro? Cos I think it's funny. Why Avramax over Borrelsword or Accesscode? Cos I think it's <strong>REALLY</strong> funny. Why Harpie Conductor over any other generic link 2? Well, the reason rhymes with ""Leather Pants"". wait.

In all honesty, this deck was made with fun in mind more than competitive viability, because I feel these days we're so focused on how GOOD a deck is, we forget the simple things, like putting big chunguses on the board and slapping your opponent. We forget how hilarious it is to use waifu cards (we all know that's part of the reason you're playing Harpies ;) (Don't worry I won't tell anyone)) to combo up into huge boys with big numbers and slap the shit out of your opponent. That said, there are a few cards in here that make the deck more viable if you did want to go play this at your locals. For example. Dragunity Arma Gram is your out to Winda, and Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds is just funny lol.

Now, how about tech cards? We got Tempest, Dragon ruler of motherfuckin' storms babyyyyy, this boy provides a healthy dose of nostalgia whilst also being a searcher and combo extender! We also got Queen Dragun Djinn, which is a blast from the past, but this Dragun ain't nothing like the one you're probably used to. She's a solid extender in this deck, and comes up a lot more often than you'd think! You can use her to quickly get out a synchro in your grave and make a crystal wing, or get another dragon to make Heavenly Spheres. Harpie Dancer has a really funny interaction with Harpie Perfumer. Notice how perfumer isn't once per turn? Yep, you can add as many elegant egotists as you want by bouncing back your harpie perfumer.

Speaking of funny interactions, you can discard Hysteric Sign off Dragon Ravine and just add 3 cards from your deck to your hand in the end phase. Funny, right?

In short, this deck has everything from semi-viability to cool dragons to Mai Valentine's massive b̶o̶o̶b̶s̶  personality and character.

Give it a shot! :)"

<a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>:

it has a target-immunity against all card-effects and gets special summoned from the hand or the graveyard when a dark monster gets tributed.

Ways to special summon it:

-If you have <a data-name=""The Black Stone of Legend"">The Black Stone of Legend</a> you can use the effect to get a red-eyes-monster without losing a monster from the tribute.

-If you tribute <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> to prevent battle damage it triggers the effect, if you use Linkuriboh's second tribute-effect from the graveyard on dark monsters it also works.

-When you play <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> to summon <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>, it has also a tribute effect that triggers the effect. When you use <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>'s effect to destroy all cards on the field when it's summoned you destroy also <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>, because you can only chain the summon effect after the trigger-effect of <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>. This means he will also get destroyed then, so you can still use it to get <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> but then you can't use <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>'s effect.

-<a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> can also tribute dark monsters to put a card from the opponent's hand to the deck.

-<a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a> tributes a level-8-or-higher monster

<a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a>:

it has multiple different effects.

-When you draw it you can shuffle it back into the deck, to draw a new card and bring <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> to the Graveyard in the same time. This is good because then you can use <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> to fusion summon from the Graveyard or you can special summon <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> to trigger the fusion-summon effect of it and use a 'level 8 or higher'-monster of the opponent as fusion-material.

-When you have <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> in the hand or it is in the Graveyard, you can special summon it, but you have to discard <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> from the hand.

-When <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> is in the Graveyard it can trigger the effect even when you do not have <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> in the hand, then you can shuffle it back into the deck and bring <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> to the graveyard. If you put <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> to the graveyard from the deck in this way you can set it to the field in the end phase. This works because it's name become <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> when it's in the Graveyard or on the field, but not when it's in the hand, then you wouldn't get <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> in the end phase.

<a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a>:

It has a special summon effect, that destroy's one of your monsters and one of the opponent cards, so you can shoot an important card with this effect, with <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a> and a normal monster or token you can choose it as a target and it won't get destroyed, because the monsters get destroyed after the special summon happened. When this card is sent from the field to the graveyard you get a level-1 plant monster from the deck to the hand, which is <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>. It has to be on the field before it is sent to the graveyard, so you can not fusion summon it from the hand or discard it to trigger the effect, but you can fusion summon or link summon it from the field. It puts a monster from the graveyard back to the deck as the second effect then, and when you do not have a monster in the graveyard, the effect does not trigger and you won't get <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>. With this second effect you can put fusion material for the red-eyes fusion back to the deck, so it can work even when one of the materials got destroyed first. You can for example also put <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> back to the deck to maybe fusion summon again with it later. You can let <a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a> get destroyed if you have no other monsters and then special summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a> when the opponent attacks directly to destroy another monster and to get <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> for the next turn.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a>:

To fusion summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> you must have <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and a Warrior-monster (<a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a>) in the deck or in the hand, or it won't work. You can also summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> or with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> and use it as a normal monster. This is good with <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a>, or if you cannot fusion summon it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> and you want to use <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> or <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a>.

<a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a>:

The Red-Eyes Fusion target, it can shoot spells/traps with the '<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>'-combo. It can also special summon a Red-Eyes-Monster but then you can't use the shoot-effect.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>:

When you use <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> it's best to summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> with the tribute-effect. Then you can wait for an attack or attack an opponent monster, if you attack and it gets destroyed by battle you get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> in the same battle-phase, so that you can attack again. With <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> you then have 2700atk and a normal monster, and with <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> you can unequip <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> directly to shoot a spell/trap. If the opponent has a spell/trap this is the fastest way of shooting it without extra-costs, you get then a level-1-dragon to the hand, so it's also more effective then getting a 2700-monster. The best level-1 Dragon is <a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a> because you can get a level-8 Synchro when you normal summon it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> in the graveyard, as an alternative you can also get <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>. To trigger this second effect of <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> it has to get sent to the graveyard as an equipment (spell/trap), so if the monster gets destroyed you get nothing, because the equipment-target gets destroyed before the effect triggers. This is why you must unequip it with <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a>'s effect,  you can also trigger this effect with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a>'s effect which can destroy any equipment-cards for the negate-effect. Other alternatives are the shoot-effects of <a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a> and <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>, that you could also use to shoot your own cards, or with the effect of <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>. <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> destroys the monster and the equipment at the same time, so the effect gets triggered by it.

<a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>:

You can use it to summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>, to have a better defense, or you can use it's tribute effect to trigger <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>'s special summon effect. The second effect of it can bring <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> back in the deck if you want to fusion summon it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>. This effect can be used to get <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> back to the hand. You can not use the tribute effect in the same turn you got it back to the hand, but you can use it for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, or to get <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>.

<a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>: It's a good special summon card. It can be used as a monster with a different type to link summon <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>. It's second effect can bring <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> or any other monster-card to the graveyard, but only when you play the second <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a> in one duel to banish the first from the graveyard, you can not use the effect twice in one turn.

<a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>: Good Token-card that works good with special-summons. The tokens are good with <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi</a>, and you can also link-summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, without other cards when you use <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>.

<a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a>: When it get normal summoned or special summoned you can discard one card and fusion summon a level 8 or higher monster of the opponent to <a data-name=""Brigrand The Glory Dragon"">Brigrand The Glory Dragon</a>. You could also use an opponent's fusion-monster to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>, or 2 opponent dark monsters, when you have Lair of Darkness, to fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a>. You can put it with <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> from the deck to the graveyard, to special summon it later, if you draw <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> first. <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> is a Fusion-card that only works with at least one dragon as material, and that can be only used with cards in the graveyard when <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> (or <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a>) is one of the materials. Another secondary effect is that you can Discard <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> with <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>'s Trigger-effect if you have both in the hand, and then set it in the End-phase, this is powerful, because then you can fusion summon with <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> from the Graveyard in the next turn. If you summon <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> with <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> or <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a> it also triggers the fusion-effect.

<a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a>: When you normal summon it you get <a data-name=""Blooming of the Darkest Rose"">Blooming of the Darkest Rose</a> as the only 'Rose'-card in the deck. When it is in the Graveyard and <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> gets destroyed by an opponent's card effect or by battle, you get it back to the hand. You can use it as a level-3 tuner with a level-4 monster and a level-1 monster to summon a level 8-synchro-monster. You can also summon <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> with only one other level-4 monster, but then you can not revive <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> with <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>'s effect, after you used the destroy-effect.

<a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a>: If you have a level-8-monster in the hand you can summon <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a> with its fusion-effect, and then you also have a level-8 monster in the graveyard that you can banish when <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a> gets destroyed to summon it again. You can also use it to fusion summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> or <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a>, and if you already have <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> you can put predator tokens on the opponent monsters and then also use them as fusion material.

<a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>: When it battles the opponent monster gets destroyed, so is good to set it as a defense, but you can also attack monsters to destroy them with the effect. When you have it in the hand you can special summon it when an opponent monster attacks directly, and you can get it to the hand with <a data-name=""Sage De Fleur"">Sage De Fleur</a>'s effect. When it gets destroyed by battle or when it gets detroyed by your or your opponent's card effect you get <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a> from the deck which you can use to fusion summon a Predaplant-monster.

<a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a>: It's a level-1 Tuner to summon <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of The Tenyi</a> with only one level-7 card. When you have it in the hand or maybe get it with <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a>'s effect, you can normal summon it to summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> from the Graveyard and use it as Synchro-material.

Draw cards, <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a> is as a Field Spell also used to get more Tokens with <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>, it can be used when you set monsters, when you summon tokens with <a data-name=""Phantom Skyblaster"">Phantom Skyblaster</a>, <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> and maybe <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a>. It also works with normal monsters and gives them a 'monster-effect'-immunity, you can use <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Berserker Of The Tenyi</a> then. <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a> can be used to secure normal monsters and tokens from the destroy-effect of <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>, but it will also get destroyed after the monsters got protected by its effect. <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a> is a better alternative to <a data-name=""Trade-In"">Trade-In</a> because you can summon level-8-or-higher-monsters very fast in the midgame, if you use the tribute effect it will also summon <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>, so you could tribute a fusion monster and still have a monster with 3000 atk then, it can tribute an opponent monster if you have <a data-name=""Lair Of Darkness"">Lair Of Darkness</a>. Chaos space brings Chaos Valkyria to the hand, you also have to discard a dark monster, this way you can instantly special summon Chaos Valkyria by banishing a monster in the graveyard. For the draw effect you can banish <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a> or any extra-deck monster (they cannot be normal summoned) with the second <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>. You could also banish <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> with it's own effect or a fusion/synchro monster with <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a>'s effect, it also works for <a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a> as the 'Instant Fusion'-target

<a data-name=""Lair Of Darkness"">Lair Of Darkness</a>: If you have Tribute Effects that tribute monsters you can also tribute the opponents monsters. You can use this effect with <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> on any monster, with <a data-name=""Advance Draw"">Advance Draw</a> and with <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> on level-1 monsters if it is in the graveyard. You could make a monster level-1 if you have <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> with the Predator counters. You also get tokens with it together with the other tribute-effects that are self-tributes and with normal tribute-summons. The Second effect makes all monsters dark so you can fusion-summon the opponent's monsters with <a data-name=""Super Polymerizatio"">Super Polymerizatio</a>n or with <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a>.

<a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">, </a><a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">, </a><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>: Reborn-Effects, Special summon-effects, with <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> summoned in the opponent's end phase, it's possible to summon <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> to clear the whole field with <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> and then normal summon after the destroy-effect, you can also use the tokens for defense or only for <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>, <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a>: Fusion cards, you can 'copy' <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> with <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>. It's always best to first use <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, to make the draw phase better and to not draw the fusion-material-cards later. You can get <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> with <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> if you discarded <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> first with another effect so that it is in the graveyard. <a data-name=""Branded in White"">Branded in White</a> can fusion summon with material from the graveyard if you have <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> or <a data-name=""Albion the Blackclad Dragon"">Albion the Blackclad Dragon</a> in the hand, on the field or also in the graveyard.

&nbsp;

Traps:

<a data-name=""Call Of The Haunted"">Call Of The Haunted</a>, <a data-name=""Escape From The Dark Dimension"">Escape From The Dark Dimension</a>:

Special Summon-Cards from the graveyard and the banished cards from <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> or <a data-name=""Chaos Valkyria"">Chaos Valkyria</a>.

<a data-name=""Paleozoic Olenoides"">Paleozoic Olenoides</a>, <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>:

good token-cards for <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a> can be used more than one time because you can shuffle it back into the deck. With <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a> in the graveyard you have also a good protection for <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> and <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>, if they would get destroyed by a card-effect, you can chain this card to it and banish them first until the next turn. You can also protect them from battle damage, especially <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> with 500 atk, if you use it before the battle.

<a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a>: good defensive card that works good against other extra-deck monsters, it has a good earlygame-strength. This deck is best with <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>or <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a> in the graveyard, then it becomes fast in the midgame. The deck is also a bit counterplay-heavy, so it can be good to wait a turn with some plays.

&nbsp;

Extra Deck:

Link:

<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a>: used to use the tokens, <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> has also two tribute-effects that trigger <a data-name=""Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair"">Darkest Diabolos, Lord Of The Lair</a>'s special summon effect, and that work good with <a data-name=""Lair Of Darkness"">Lair Of Darkness</a>. You can also link-summon <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> when you have <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a>. When you tribute it to prevent battle-damage, you can get <a data-name=""The Black Stone Of Legend"">The Black Stone Of Legend</a> back to the hand and link-summon <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> again.

<a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>: It's best to alyways summon it first to get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> and to have <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> in the graveyard and not in the deck for a better draw phase.

<a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>: You can summon <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> and destroy all cards on the field then with its effect. You can use it as a quick effect in your or in the opponent's turn. You need two monsters with differens types to summon it, and then you also need a plant monster that you can tribute for the effect. As plant monsters you can use <a data-name=""Predaplant Chlamydosundew"">Predaplant Chlamydosundew</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Sarraceniant"">Predaplant Sarraceniant</a>, <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> or tokens from <a data-name=""Blooming Of The Darkest Rose"">Blooming Of The Darkest Rose</a>. You can also use the Fusion-predaplant-monsters because all cards get destroyed anyway. If you have 4 monsters a good play would be to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, and then use the effect to summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> by using it and one of the opponent monsters as material. Then you can't special summon, but you can activate the Crossrose-effect in the opponent turn and use the <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a> as the tribute, this way you get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> to the hand in the next turn because of the secondary effect of <a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>.

<a data-name=""Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Berserker Of The Tenyi</a>: It's a normal monster if you have <a data-name=""Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi"">Flawless Perfection Of The Tenyi</a>.

Synchro:

<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>: It's effect can destroy all cards on the field, which is good to outplay a lot of combo's that need 2 or 3 cards to work. When you summoned it with <a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a> you also get it back after all cards got destroyed but it only has 2400 atk. You don't have to use the destroy effect but then you can not use it later, if you have it on the field with or without the destroy-effect you can also turn monsters from defense position to attack position and change the atk to 0, by banishing a plant-monsters from the graveyard. <a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a> as a level-10-synchro-monster is also not a good card in a graveyard deck because it only destroys all cards when you banish the graveyard-monsters.

<a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a>: The level-7-alternative to <a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a> if you have <a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a> and a level-4-monster. <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> can put extra-deck monsters back into the extra-deck by attacking them, so they won't get targeted, with a link monster you can also build a 'wall' with it.

<a data-name=""Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi</a>: It's a strong Level-8 Snychro-monster that you can summon very fast when you play <a data-name=""Rokket Synchron"">Rokket Synchron</a> to get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> from the Graveyard. 'Level 8'-monsters are goot for <a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, then he can come back one time for every level 8 monster in the Graveyard, you can also use it as fusion-material. This card is an alternative to <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> is slower in the early-game and in the deck are only a few link-monsters, it is a dragon and also stronger as a 'midgame-card', but this deck needs fast combo's for the early-game because most combo's need 1 or 2 turns to function. You can also revive <a data-name=""Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi</a> and it still works, but you can not revive <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> and use its effect. <a data-name=""Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi"">Draco Berserker Of The Tenyi</a>'s negate works only for monster-effects but it has a banish effect and a double-attack-effect.

Fusion:

<a data-name=""Thousand-Eyes Restrict"">Thousand-Eyes Restrict</a>: 'Instant Fusion'-target

<a data-name=""Brigrand The Glory Dragon"">Brigrand The Glory Dragon</a>: It is a '<a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>'-Fusion to use the fusion-effect of <a data-name=""Fallen Of Albaz"">Fallen Of Albaz</a> with an opponent monster. It has to be level 8 or higher as an alternative to <a data-name=""Sprind The Irondash Dragon"">Sprind The Irondash Dragon</a> and <a data-name=""Titaniklad The Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad The Ash Dragon</a>. It also has the best effects together with the other monster, because it has 'battle-damage'-immunity and can protect other monsters from the opponent targeting monster-effects.

<a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a>: It is a bit like <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> but a bit weaker. You have to summon it as the first 'boss-monster' if possible in every duel, to have a better draw phase. This makes the duels similar to each other, and it's often about the flow how you archieve the set goals of the deck. It can negate one card or monster effect per turn, but only if you already attacked the opponent. When you attack you get the equipment that you can destroy to trigger the effect, the only way to get a second negate in one turn is to destroy <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Baby Dragon"">Red-Eyes Baby Dragon</a> while it is equipped to <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Black Dragon"">Red-Eyes Black Dragon</a> because in the deck are no other Equip-spells and also no other warriors, and it would also take too long to use them, <a data-name=""Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight"">Gearfried The Red-Eyes Iron Knight</a> could have an equip but it is already used as the 'equipment'-warrior. You still can attack with two Red-Eyes-monsters, this way, if you negate one time during the battle, you then maybe get the negate-effect back when you attack with the second Red-Eyes-monster. It is not good to play <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Slash Dragon"">Red-Eyes Slash Dragon</a> in the first turn, because you only have 2800 atk then instead of 3000 and also no negate, so you have to wait until you can attack after you summoned it or you revive it to attack then. Then it can be strong, because it can negate every turn after it attacked without further activation costs but attacking.

<a data-name=""Predaplant Chimerafflesia"">Predaplant Chimerafflesia</a>: it's a good starting-monster in the early-game, because you have 3500atk in a battle and the opponent loses 1000 atk, so the opponent has to destroy it with card-effects. You also get <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a> or maybe <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> to the hand in the next turn after it got destroyed.

<a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a>: it can negate monster effects by putting predator-counters on them as a quick-effect that works once per turn.

<a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a>: It can be often summoned with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> with up to 3 of the opponent's monsters. It has a special-summon negate as effect, and if you fusion summon it then with one dark monster to <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a> you can put one predator counter on a monster and directly special summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum</a> again from the graveyard.

<a data-name=""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"">Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon</a>: It is the strongest Predaplant-monster as a 'midgame'-monster. Every time it gets destroyed all monsters on the field gets destroyed, then you can get it back by banishing on of the level-8 monsters from the graveyard. Since it needs a level-8 monster as material you always have at least one in the graveyard, except you used one of the opponent monster as material. It also has a negate-effect."

You win by pulling the 5 Exodia cards :3

Works if opponent doesn't have a million handtraps / negates per turn. Also, Nibiru killes the deck lmao.

How to utilize the deck (this is just for you if you want the deck to be explained, you can just start playing the deck and learn it as its pretty goddamn easy to use) :

Combo 1 (Numeron)
<ul>
 	<li>Use""Numeron Network"", can be searched out by ""Terraforming"" as well as ""Numeron Wall"" if conditions are met (easy)</li>
 	<li>Activate it and discard ""Numeron Calling"" from deck to GY (be sure to not have monsters in your side of field)</li>
 	<li>Summon the 4 Numeron XYZ gate monsters into field in face-up defense positions just to be save</li>
 	<li>if possible; Activate ""Memories of Hope"" from hand to draw 4 cards. If you don't have this in your hand, do  Combo 2 to try and get it first.</li>
 	<li>Link summon Skull Dread and activate it's effect to draw 4 cards and return 3 cards. The best cards to return to deck is Numeron Calling, Any spellbook cards (prefer Spellbook of Knowledge), Any duplicate cards. Do not return [Numeron Network unless you have a Numeron wall in your hand], [Torrential Tribute], and stall cards</li>
 	<li>Set cards so your hand only has 6 cards. If possible, set 1 [Torrential Tribute]</li>
 	<li>End turn</li>
 	<li>When your opponent summon a monster, Torrential tribute it to destroy your Skull Dread so you can activate Numeron Network the very next turn and draw up to 8 cards again.</li>
</ul>
Combo 2 (Spellbook) ;
<ul>
 	<li>REMINDER ; Don't do this combo and Numeron's combo in the same turn, you can't normal summon Spellbook Magician AND link Skull Dread, dunno why</li>
 	<li>Use either Spellbook magician or Spellbook of secrets to search the other and then search Spellbook of Knowledge to tribute Spellbook Magician and draw 2 cards</li>
 	<li>do not use this combo if you already have [Numeron Network]/[Terraforming]/[Numeron Wall] + [Memories of Hope] in your hand as your opponent can negate [Spellbook of Knowledge]'s tribute, leaving you with a sad and stupid Spellbook Magician in the field, preventing you from activating [Numeron Network].</li>
</ul>
Combo 3 (Draw of Fate) ;
<ul>
 	<li>Use if you have 3/4 Exodia pieces already</li>
 	<li>Activate [Draw of Fate], select 1/2 last Exodia piece + allure of darkness + any draw card</li>
 	<li>If activated, Any card you draw will likely win you the game.</li>
 	<li>Don't start your turn with this cause it only lets you activate 1 other card effects after.</li>
</ul>
Don't attack with Skull Dread directly as you want your LP to be lower than your opponent to activate [Draw of Fate]

Activate Pot of Avarice to return only XYZ and Link monsters, return 1 Spellbook Magician only if you have a leftover Spellbook card.

&nbsp;

Best starting hand (probably);
<ul>
 	<li>5 Exodia pieces (Pog)</li>
 	<li>Numeron Wall/Terraforming + Memories of Hope + Torrential Tribute + One Day of Peace + Spellbook searcher</li>
</ul>
Like I said, its a super easy deck that anyone can immediately play, granted you won't win a lot as I have only won max 30% of my games i think, but hey, at least you get to play Exodia and win .

Sick of losing to nibiru and dark ruler? Look no further.,"This deck theoretically is good. It is nibiru proof, is hand-trap resilient and doesn't run as many bricks as dark warriors do. It also is drnm and forbidden drip proof. The only things that can beat it going second are cards like cosmic cyclone or blizzard, or handtraps like lancea or d shifter. It also does relatively well against trap decks, having a built in heavy storm. Not only this, but it is also relatively budget, especially if you drop a few of the expensive cards for extenders or generic cards. This is of course, all theoretical, as i have not done any real testing on the deck.

Use the Impcantations to search your ritual pieces, so that you can summon a Chaos MAX. If going first, you can instead make Amorphactor Pain, skipping your opponent's main phase 1, which also skips their battle phase.

You don't use your normal summon in any of that, so there are some normal summons included :

-Iblee, since if you summon it before any impcantations, you can link it away into an Almiraj, giving your opponent a 0-def monster to OTK with thanks to Chaos MAX, and as a bonus, it restricts your opponent to only special summoning links while they control it.

And then, if you have two impcantations out by using their effect, you can do a tribute summon instead :

-Zaborg, to destroy itself and then send 8 cards from both player's extra decks to the GY. You can sent N'tss or the Fossil Knight to destroy enemy's cards, or Arc Light to search ritual pieces.

-Vanity's Ruler, to prevent your opponent from special summoning.

The combination of floodgate effects and OTK potential means you at least have plays, whether you're forced to go first or second.

The idea here is locking in 3 aspect.

Buster blader fusion + syncro locking out of monster effects and attack position.

The equip lvl1 locking the extra deck.

Locking spells.

The engin I put here is ROKKET + chaos, since this is a very fun splashy engine.
We have <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes+Dark+Dragoon"">DRAGOON</a>, which has good synrgy here, firstly he is the main spellcaster for <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Secret+Village+of+the+Spellcasters"">Secret Village</a>, also the Prolog combo happends in the opponent turn so we happy to use <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Red-Eyes+Fusion"">Red Eys Fusion</a>.
We have the base Buster Blader cards for the combo (we play 2 of each ""brick"" so we can still combo if we draw them).
Lastly we have 7 card that each allow for spell block.
prosperety is optinal but good for acquiring last pice for perfect combo.
0 handtraps becose this build only tries to combo, feel free to add some.
Fun fact this deck can play TCBOO if you want.

&nbsp;

1 card well known prolog combo.

hand: prolog + dragon / Buster Whelp.
normal your dragon, make link 1 (defult is striker go for anima if need spellcaster).
set prolog.
opponent turn activate prolog send memories and buster blader.
chain memoris banish buster blader and dragon from grave.
resolve both

end board: Buater fusion+syncro. (+link1)

&nbsp;

Combo for extradeck lock.
hand: Accses to Prolog + acsses to Protector Whelp.           Example hand: quicklunch + Buster Whelp.
Make protector, send to GY <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dragon+Buster+Destruction+Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword.</a>
Set Prolog same as before.
After prolog combo activate the syncro to equip DBDS to fusion.

end board: Buater fusion+syncro+equip. (+link2)

full moneymaker combo

hand: acs to prolog, acs to village, any way to Summon 3 monsters this turn.
normal summon+extender link to protector
send to GY the equip lvl1. (if have BB in hand can SS here).
protector + extender link to verte anaconda.
anaconda make dragoon.
set Prolog.
activate Village.

end board: Buater fusion+syncro+equip, dragoon, verte, village.

general tips:
Try exploring how to summon combo picese.
protector can SS the brick from hand.
syferd can suffle red eyes back to deck.

The Charmers are a group of students with the potential to become such mages. They train under with the great Doriado, a dryad that not only mastered one element, but six. They train so that they can become masters of their element

Originally there were four, Eria, Wynn, Hiita and Aussa. these maidens were discovered when their respective families noticed them in a trance and acting strangely. Their trance was a result of possession by a being aspected to the same element. Doriado managed to find such beings and quell their hold before taking the girls who then adopted their possessors as familiars. The bond between the students and their familiars, as well as each other, strengthened over the years.

Lyna and Dharc came later. A pair of siblings tuned to the primordial and chaotic elements of light and shadow. Doriado noticed they seemed to have greater control over their powers and even contact with their possessors before meeting her, and that their previous circumstances weren't as king to them as their peers'.

The fates of these six are now as avatars of the elements. Forces of nature and elementals themselves. Will these roles lead to them being consumed by that they study to tame or will their humanity shine through and make them powerful mages in their own right? And what will become of the familiars as their training is compete?""

What we have here is a Familiar-Possessed Charmer Control deck. As such it relies mainly on two cards. <a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Luna"">Fairy Tail - Luna</a> and A<a data-name=""wakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend"">wakening of the Possessed - Nefariouser Archfiend</a> for consistency and power. While most people likely use the original quartet of Aussa, Hiita, Eria and Wynn and some had decided to add in Lyna as well since LIOV, I make the decision to run all 6 of the FP cards and all the available Link counterparts, as well as all 4 of the Awakened Familiars (thought they are all at one each)

The gist of their game plan seems to be to use <a data-name=""Awakening of the Possessed"">Awakening of the Possessed</a> to turn your Charmers into beatsticks, but also to go for a control playstyle with Luna. To the latter end I use the in-theme cards <a data-name=""Possessed Partnerships"">Possessed Partnerships</a> and <a data-name=""Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin"">Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin</a>. For off-theme cards I run <a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a>, <a data-name=""Witchcrafter Golemn Aruru"">Witchcrafter Golemn Aruru</a>, <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> and <a data-name=""Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries"">Ghost Reaper &amp; Winter Cherries</a>. the Side deck also plays into this with <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a>, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a>, <a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a> and <a data-name=""Denko Sekka"">Denko Sekka</a> in triplicate as well as a 3rd Possessed Partnership and for one-offs Raigeki and Dimensional Barrier. I also run two copes of Fairy Tail Tales, but for some reason that's not in the database (Rohcha however is, but I'm obviously not running her). <a data-name=""Spirit Charmers"">Spirit Charmers</a>, <a data-name=""Spellbook of Knowledge"">Spellbook of Knowledge</a>, <a data-name=""Terraforming"">Terraforming</a> and <a data-name=""Metaverse"">Metaverse</a> are there to help me get to key cards.

&nbsp;

Rounding out the extra deck would be...
<ul>
 	<li>Cherries Targets: <span>Winda</span>, <span>Trishula</span> and <span>Vortex</span> (might replace Trish with <span>The Arrival Cyverse</span>, <span>Dark Templar</span> or <span>Dark Infant</span>)</li>
 	<li>Rank 4s: <span>Castel</span>, <span>Emeral</span>, <span>Dweller</span> and <span>Tornado Dragon</span> (Some can double as Cherries targets, thought I might replace Dweller for another Cherries target)</li>
 	<li>Links: <span>Apollousa</span>, <span>Borrelsword</span>, <span>Barricadeborg Blocker <span>(Link-4s can also double as Cherries targets)</span>
</span></li>
</ul>
I'm certain there is room for improvement, especially regarding the ED (and the lack of Trap Trick), so any and all feedback is appreciated."

&nbsp;

It still weak towards hand traps like always, until they give us something to counter that I can't really offer a solution that it.

&nbsp;

Main combo normally results in a lock down board, or hand wipe. It can brick but I find it runs at about 60-70% effective rate to end the board with lock down. I find it runs about 20-30% brick, and 10% hand loop.

CORE:

1x Ghostrick Stein: For the searching of Ghostrick Spells/Traps.

3x Ghostrick Mummy: For the extra summons.

1x Ghostrick Yuki-onna: She's just cute, not really functional though.

2x Ghostrick Fairy: For the summoning of GY monsters.

1x Ghostrick Nekomusume: For control of the board when a Lv. 4 or higher monster enters.

3x Ghostrick Doll: For deck summons.

1x Ghostrick Jackfrost: A neat self-summoning handtrap but no need for more than 1.

2x Ghostrick Lantern: Same as Jackfrost but 2

3x Ghostrick Specter: Same as Lantern but 3

1x Terraforming: For easy access to Field Spells.

3x Book of Taiyou: For flipping. The monsters have self-flipping effects already, so this just speeds things up again.

1x Ghostrick Mansion: The main Field spell. Halves non-Ghostrick damage.

1x Ghostrick Museum: A helpful support for Flip cards and helps stall oncoming damage.

1x Ghostrick Parade: A search card. Helpful when you have all your monsters flipped down.

1x Ghostrick Night: For when your opponent runs Flip monsters. Otherwise, not very good.

1x Ghostrick Go-Round: For when you flip a lot. Very funny.

1x Shaddoll Schism: All-around better version of Shaddoll Fusion. Feel free to switch out for Shaddoll Fusion.

3x Ultimate Providence: Good for negation. Since there are many different card types, I thought it would be good in here.

1x Ghostrick Break: Just a good mid-game card for when your monsters get deleted.

1x Ghostrick Renovation: Decent Field Spell recovery plus an extra XYZ effect. All around, it's a nice card.

1x Ghostrick Scare: For flipping your opponent's monsters down.

3x Subterror Succession: Helps with all Flip monsters. A good support card.

1x Subterror Guru: A support for flips and the other Subterror card in this deck.

1x Subterror Behemoth Umastryx: Good removal card and a good defender.

1x Reeshaddoll Wendi: Searches Ariel. All-around good search card, used with Shadoll Schism to fusion into El Shaddoll monsters.

1x Naelshaddoll Ariel: Good Shaddoll material. Can fill in for monsters such as Apkallone.

1x El Shaddoll Construct: Can be summoned with Shaddoll Construct's attribute.

1x El Shaddoll Apkallone: Good negation.

1x El Shaddoll Wendigo: Used with Schism to protect a monster.

1x El Shaddoll Winda: Used to cancel your opponent's combos.

1x Ghostrick Angel of Mischief: Win-con, plus a searcher for Ghostrick monsters. Use with other XYZ Ghostrick monsters to summon it.

1x Ghostrick Alucard: Useful support for Angel of Mischief.

1x Ghostrick Socuteboss: A monster zone deleter. Very good when you want to control with Winda.

1x Ghostrick Dullahan: A simple beater or boss monster for Ghostrick.

1x Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians: Used with your Spellcasters to get them back into the field.

1x Vampire Sucker: A good Zombie support card.

1x Shaddoll Construct: Used to get El Shaddoll Construct.

Fight me.,"Oh boy it's banlist season. Dino got hit, Dragons finally got hit and Drytron's allowed to live for once. While these changes were to be expected Konami went a little wilder than last time. There's the Drident ban. A *checks notes* quick effect, targeted destruction for *checks notes again* face-up cards? I'm sure that'll stop Zeus. It does stop Utopic Future Dragon from selling but it's not like that card releases next set in 2 weeks or anything, right? Right? Then there's Engage back to 1, making Sky Striker meta again. Well, every eight match at least. And how does Konami justify bringing back such a powerhouse? By giving us Salamangreat players a...chokepoint? Don't get me wrong, bouncing a monster's fun and all and summoning Jack from your deck to add Gazelle back to hand is great but it's not like it increases the deck's power level like Engage does. It did, however, invite a lot of people to brainstorm on how to best play Salamangreat. And the results are...mellow. What do I mean by that? Let's break down the issues modern Salamangreat deckbuilding has.

&nbsp;

<span>The Flame Bufferlo versus Lady Debug debate:</span>

Salamangreat has two main starters, Bufferlo and Debug. Both are fantastic cards but each for completely different reasons. Let's go over their core strenghts. I'm a fan of Bufferlo so I'll start with that one.

<span><a data-name=""Flame Bufferlo"">Flame Bufferlo</a></span>: While it is a level 3 Fire Effect monsters let me be clear: There's an almost 0 percent chance you'll use it to make Miragestallio! It's strength is that it's effect doesn't trigger until it's linked off, meaning you can ""chainblock"" it's effect with Balelynx, guaranteeing you a draw 2 effect. It discards when resolving it's effect, making way for another great strength of his. It doesn't contest with your Salamangreat monsters for your Normal Summon. Jack Jaguar, Falco and especially Foxy are other cards that you could normal summon to start your combo. You can discard them with Cynet Mining but it's far more likely that you'll get them into the GY by linking them off. If you normal summon Bufferlo instead he then discards them, turning your otherwise normal summon into an extender. In short, he doesn't ""add"" to your normal summon since he'll just turn your other normals into specials. What he doesn't do is search Gazelle. That makes him fairly weak in a deck that runs only one of each trap and a lot of handtraps. If you're going first seeing handtraps is great and all but traps are generally stronger and if you're going second drawing into your handtraps then is usually too late. but if you're heavy on traps, and on 2 of each Salamangreat trap, it doesn't matter as much if you go first or second, you'll draw, set, pass and win the game during your opponents turn. After all, Gazelle only sets up one interruption anyways and good luck resolving that against an established board. Since it ""converts"" your Salamangreat normal summons I'd recommend 3 Foxy and 2 Spinny (Foxy is great at playing through Nibiru as you don't need to control a Salamangreat monster).

<span><a data-name=""Lady Debug"">Lady Debug</a></span>: This card is a powerhouse. It's a one card OTK with Accesscode Talker and searches Gazelle or a Spinny if you already have access to Gazelle. But the strength of a card's usually negatively correlating to how often you'll resolve it. It's an easy choke and loses to both negates and spot removal. That's why it's generally used in a deck playing a more handtrap/extender oriented version (I say extender oriented but I don't think there's much of a difference in how many extenders both versions play unless you're leaning strongly towards level 3 spam). If it resolves you might just as well win and if you don't you just try again next turn and stop your opponent with your handtraps. Another strong suit of Debug is that it searches <a data-name=""Prohibit Snake"">Prohibit Snake</a> which, in this Winda infested format, is one of Salamangreat's only outs to that card. Since it does use up your normal summon I'd recommend 2 Foxy and 3 Spinny.

<span>The Mix</span>: This is where I find my issues with late Salamangreat deckbuilding. A lot of people like running Bufferlo and Debug in a 3-2 or 2-3 ratio, which I personally don't think is a good idea. As a normal summon they conflict with each other, bricking if you draw both. It also results in people playing both handtraps and traps but both only to a smaller amount, making both strategies less impactful. Now Bufferlo might just draw handtraps going second and your Debug is less likely to resolve as you have less of a chance to disrupt your opponent on their turn. I saw some people run both at three to which I gotta say: Why? In short, I think both version's have their own individual strenghts and weaknesses and I'd advise not to play a mix of both. You'll just end up playing into both weaknesses without gaining much of their individual strengths, resulting in, as I said earlier, mellow decks.

&nbsp;

<span><span>The Bufferlo Version:</span></span>

I said I before and I'll say it again, I love Flame Bufferlo. Drawing 2 and worst case setting a few feels great. Not having to worry about having your normal summon negated is awesome. Seeing your opponent's reaction in realtime when they learn that Bufferlo triggers in hand if they bounce it is priceless. Also I played Drytron when it was meta with VW and everyone was siding against it. No need to say, I did not often resolve my cards and started leaning towards control in the process. Anyways I don't think there's one right version of this deck. Some might play <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a>, some might not. Some might play less Spells and add <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> to their list. <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a>'s also totally optional and just a card I personally like a lot. Heatleo is just as good at two but I needeed space for Linguriboh and I mostly summon one to force out backrow anyway. So this is not so much me asserting Bufferlo's dominance or claiming to  have figured out the perfect deck but rather an introduction into the diversity of Salamangreat. The same is true for the side deck. There are a lot of good cards to side and I personally feel like it's hard to settle on which cards are best, especially now that the format is so young (so young in fact that hasn't even started). Nibiru, Lancea and Droll are all incredible blowout cards when you know you're going second, while floodgates might just win you the match going first but Rivalry and Gozen's strength is directly related to the current meta. Some backrow removal is important too and other's - and maybe I myself later down the line - might lean a little deaper into backrow removal. Reboot's great though, pretty much instantly wins you the game against control but too situational to play in Main. If there's anything I strongly stand by in this deck profile it's that I don't think the Bufferlo-Debug-Handtrap-Trap mix I see a lot of lately is the way to go and that purer version's of each will be the way to go. Also don't get me wrong, Miragestallio's great and I'm happy to have it back!"

This here is my attempt at a Shark deck, using Number 4: Stealth Kragen and Gozen Match to hopefully lock down the opponent's summons. Actually, even if you don't end on those two, going first is your best option.

If going first, you can sit on a Number 59: Crooked Cook that was summoned with Right-Hand Shark, leaving you with a Rank 4 that can't be destroyed by battle, and is unaffected by everything if it's the only card on your field. OR you can set up boards of Toadally Awesome, Torrential Tribute, and even Utopic Future Dragon.

But if you need to go second, you have Utopia Double for OTKs and 2 Cosmic Cyclone and Harpies' Feather Duster because screw backrow.

&nbsp;

As for this card's name, it's named after ""The Great Wave off Kanagawa"", one of Japan's most popular paintings and works of art."
