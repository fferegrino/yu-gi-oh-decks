Decklist tried 200+ times ","EDIT: I have done some changing so some of the card that I wrote could not be in the deck anymore

The starters are Aluber, Jester of Despia and Indulged Darklord.

With Aluber, if you don't already have the field spell (Despia, Theater of the Branded), you search for that, otherwise search for Branded Opening that let you search Dramaturge of Despia or, if you have high level fusion monster in the GY, Ad Libitum of Despia.

Now, with the field spell, you can fusion summon using Aluber on the field and what you have in the hand.

With Indulged Darklord you want to give to the opponent Darklord Ukoback, if you can't usually the best one to give is Darklord Superbia and you want to search for Darklord Mornigstar, if youÂ  can fusion summon into The first Darklord to nuke the board or Darklord Ixchel to cycle the deck.

Some nice interactions are:
<ul>
 	<li>you can use the darklord you give to the opponent for a fusion summon using super poly</li>
 	<li>the second effect of The first Darklord that let you special summon a fairy monster triggerÂ  Aluber, Indulged, Ukoback, Superbia</li>
 	<li>the best card to discard with Ixchel effect are the two trap cards that you can later use from the GY without paying the activation cost</li>
 	<li>the effects that discard cards like super poly, branded opening, allure of darkness, all of them synergize with Despian of tragedy letting you search for a despia monster</li>
 	<li>with golden sarcophagus if you target Despian of tragedy you trigger it's effect letting you search a despia monster and after 2 turn you take it into the hand (that's why i prefer it despite foolish burial, i found that the second effect to retrieve a speel is not that useful and i can still use it later sending Despian of tragedy to the GY with another card)</li>
 	<li>Darklord Superbia sometims miss timing so i reccomend to summon it at the end of a chain or outside of it</li>
</ul>
I don't like using card outside the archetype so I put staple cards in the side deck.

It's very easy to summon rank 8 xyz monster and I decided to use N.38 and N.90 to cover the negating effect that the deck lacks.

N.97 can be used as a finisher summoning N.100 that go easily at 9000 atk.

The deck has a lot other synergies and interactions so I reccomend to try it and have fun.

The deck is very very consistent and you have a dead hand 1/10 of the games, probably even less.

Feel free to comment if you have any advice to improve the decklist."

Kepler- searches [contract with gate to search any monster] or [contract with darkness to lockdown]
Laplace - always at double opponent's atk, piercing, once per turn battle protected
Rage - if your opponent is 4k or less LP you can direct for game
Swirl - Fuses in hand with any other monster, banish from gy to special 1 from hand
Copernicus - Foolish Burials on summon to send:

-Lamia to summon itself from GY
-Swirl to special 1 from hand
-Necro to fusion in GY
-Rage/Laplace to be summoned out of GY by another card

-Flame King Genghis
-Flame High King Genghis (also on Normal Summon)

&nbsp;

<strong>! A CAUTION ABOUT DUELIST ALLIANCE !</strong> - activating a single scale from hand to allow duelist alliance to be played will prevent Gilgamesh from activating 2 scales from deck.
Make gilgamesh first then activate duelist alliance to search:

Pendulum Switch - Special a scale to field or move a monster on field to scale
Pendulum Fusion - Fuse from field and/or the scales that you just filled with Gilgamesh (only way to make Purple Armageddon or Ceasar Ragnarok)

<strong>PRIMARY PLAY</strong> - optimal starting move to make in any duel
Get any 2 monsters on field while leaving your scales empty
Link 2 into D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh
Gilgamesh activates any 2 scales directly from deck and you take 1000 damage
-(take no damage if King Rage is one of your Scales. Pair with Kepler for scales 0+10)

<strong>Example of primary control play</strong>
Start with Kepler+Swirl+any D/D
Swirl activate in hand, fuse with D/D to summon either Genghis fusion
Normal summon Kepler to search Dark Contract with Eternal Darkness
On Kepler summon Genghis activates to summon Swirl from GY
Link 2 with Kepler+Swirl for Abyss King Gilgamesh
Gilgamesh on summon activates King Rage + Abyss Ragnarok as scales from deck
King rage stops the 1k effect damage from Gilgamesh
Pendulum Summon Kepler back from extra deck
On Kepler summon Abyss Ragnarok summons the D/D from GY
Set Contract with Eternal Darkness, activate on opponent's standby phase

Activate Swirl Slime in hand to fuse with Lamia into D/D/D Flame King Genghis
Use Lamia in GY to send Contract with Gate from hand or field to GY and special summon Lamia
Genghis activates on Lamia's summon and special summons 1 D/D from GY, choose Swirl Slime

Summon your XYZ monsters to punish your opponent for using their graveyard!,"This is my current work-in-progress pure Exorsister deck.

My build here is a lot more slower-paced compared to some other Exorsister lists. Instead of turboing out Mikhaelise to search Vadis, I opted to run more traps and sit on main deck monsters.

&nbsp;

The Game Plan:

Summon the main deck Exorsisters to try to proc them on your opponent's turn and utilize traps to interrupt your opponent's plays.

&nbsp;

My thoughts on plays:

I normally don't really like summoning Mikhaelise turn 1, opting instead to just keep the main deck monsters on the field, but Mikahelise turn 1 is definitely not a bad idea. Depending on the matchup and your opening hand, Mikhaelise turn 1 can help shape your board around the opponent and round out your plays. However, the deck is not all Exorsister. This deck runs some traps to help back up your sisters. This deck runs Traptrick to help turbo out sisters using Vadis, but it could also search out other traps in case you open Vadis or search it with Mikhaelise. IDP is great against some decks and if used properly can end turns. Imperm is nice because it can be a hand trap and a normal trap. Speaking of hand traps, this deck also runs Dimension Shifter. Dimension Shifter on its own can also end turns. If you open Dimension Shifter turn 1, you can just normal summon a main deck sister to keep Dimension Shifter active.

&nbsp;

Some of my card choices explained:

Some things I think this deck struggles with are hand advantage and finishing games.

When you're playing this deck, you often have to vomit out your hand. It feels almost like BA to me, except without the Cir-Dante loop. To combat this, I decided to add desires.

As for finishing games, it's a bit hard to link climb, and Vadis locks you into sisters, so I chose to run utopia the double, which does have some conflict with desires. Until I think of a better finisher, this is what I'll stick to.

I've also been thinking of messing with all of the sister ratios some more. I was originally running 3 of all the main deck sisters, but I felt like Elaine just wasn't doing much, so I decided to cut it to 2 for another copy of a trap. The ratios I have feel pretty good because you want to see at least one every turn. But I might experiment with it some more especially if I implement other engines.

&nbsp;

My Thoughts

Overall, I've been having a lot of fun with Exorsisters. They're not the most competitive deck, but they are a lot of fun to play. Specifically, I love Carpedibel, their in-archetype prohibition. It just feels super rewarding to use. I'm thinking of experimenting with some other engines as well. I've seen some Magistus, Brave Token, and other builds that seem fun.

&nbsp;

Please let me know if you have any thoughts or changes! Also, The side deck doesn't have much thought put into it, it's just some random stuff I threw in there."

Remove it if you like, it won't hurt an","This deck contains the usual Red-Eyes cards as well as the materials needed to summon Mirror Force Dragon- possibly the worst things to put in one of these decks.

&nbsp;

Using Insight, you can send one Red-Eyes and add one Spirit to your hand. You set spirit and chain it when you can- except to a Raigeki or other cards that remove your monsters.

You can use Cards of the Red Stone to get a pot of greed AND allow for one more use of the aforementioned Insight.

You can also use the XYZ monster to really quickly fill up the board- one Red-Eyes per turn. The turn you activate it- 2800 [from the XYZ monster] plus 2400 [from the Red-Eyes you summon by detaching material] = 5200 attack total. The next turn you add 2400 [from another detach] making it 7600 ATK. Over the 2 turns you deal over 12,000 ATK, and is enough to kill the player from full LP. All you need is 2 Red-Eyes monsters.

&nbsp;

You can easily get Red-Eyes Alternative by discarding one Red-Eyes, or even the Alternative.

There are many more combos but these are the ones that come to mind."

The deck manages to do some cool stuff if you open decently and the search power is amazing if you can blow up the field spells, Pit stop acts like a little pot of greed and if you banish it special summons and Test Run increases the level of your monsters and destroys one card on the field.

As for some plays going into Dawn Dragster manages to negate spells and traps, Shining Star gets counters to negate and destroy monsters and Dark Dragster is not a hard once per turn spot removal.

Scrap Dragon blows up your field spells so you get a search and blow up a card on the field, but if you are feeling destructive and want a board wipe it's very easy to access Black Rose Dragon

It manages to do some cool stuff and it's less than 10 euros, so i hope you guys enjoy it!"

<p></p>
<p>Grupo 1: Monstros de LV 8 (parte agressiva/defensiva)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Esse grupo tem a funÃ§Ã£o de invocar os Monstros Rituais ""MegÃ¡lito"" da mÃ£o, ao se enviarem como custo e tributando monstros cuja soma dos LVs seja igual ou maior do que o LV do monstro a ser invocado. Tenha em mente que, infelizmente, o monstro enviado para o GY e que estÃ¡ invocando outro por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual nÃ£o tÃªm seu LV contado para a soma, apesar de enviÃ¡-los ainda ser o custo do efeito de invocar. AlÃ©m do efeito de InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual, cada um deles tÃªm efeitos diferentes quando em campo. Ambos os efeitos de cada monstro sÃ£o Hard Once Per Turn. SÃ£o eles:</p>
<p>""Aratron"": este serve como uma hand trap durante a Fase Principal, pois seu efeito de invocar 1 monstro ""MegÃ¡lito"" da mÃ£o Ã© um Efeito RÃ¡pido. Isso Ã© Ã³timo porque: 1. VocÃª pode pegar seu oponente de surpresa, destruindo o campo do seu oponente com ""Bethor"" no turno 1 do oponente; 2. Te permite esquivar de efeitos que dÃ£o alvo nos seus monstros, fazendo os efeitos deles passarem mesmo tomando ""ImpermanÃªncia Infinita"" (""Infinite Impermanence''), por exemplo. Seu outro efeito, em campo, Ã©: ""Quando seu oponente ativar um card ou efeito que dÃª alvo em um card que vocÃª controla (Efeito RÃ¡pido): vocÃª pode colocar um Monstro Ritual do seu GY no fundo do Deck; negue a ativaÃ§Ã£o, e se isso acontecer, destrua-o."" Eu acho muito feio quem roda menos que 3 em qualquer decklist;</p>
<p>""Bethor"": ""Se for invocado por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual: vocÃª pode dar alvo em cards que seu oponente controla atÃ© o nÃºmero de Monstros Rituais com nomes diferentes no GY; destrua-os"". Ãtima carta, mas, apesar do potencial, vocÃª precisa preparar seu campo e GY para fazer bom uso dele. Eu gosto de rodar 2, mas nÃ£o julgo quem roda menos que isso;</p>
<p>""Phaleg"": Ã© o powerhouse do Deck. Enquanto ele estiver em campo, todos os seus monstros ganham 300 ATK/DEF para cada Monstro Ritual no GY. NÃ£o Ã© raro vocÃª ficar com 3 ou 4 monstros com mais de 2500 de ATK quando ele entra em jogo. Mesma coisa que ""Bethor"", eu gosto de rodar 2, mas tambÃ©m nÃ£o julgo quem roda menos que isso.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Grupo 2: Monstros de LV 4 (buscadores/extendedores)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Todos eles tÃªm um efeito de invocar 1 Monstro Ritual da mÃ£o ao tributar monstros, incluindo eles mesmos, cuja soma dos LVs seja igual ou maior do que o LV do monstro a ser invocado. Esse efeito Ã© hard once per turn. E cada um deles tÃªm um efeito ao serem invocados por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual, e esses nÃ£o sÃ£o hard once per turn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>""Ophiel"": ""Se este card for invocado por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual: vocÃª pode adicionar 1 monstro ""MegÃ¡lito"" do seu Deck Ã  mÃ£o"". Buscador que busca quantas vezes vocÃª puder invocar ele no mesmo turno. Preciso falar que Ã© 3 no Deck? Preciso, nÃ©? Roda 3.</p>
<p>""Hagith"": ""Se este card for invocado por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual: vocÃª pode adicionar 1 card de Magia/Armadilha ""MegÃ¡lito"" do Deck Ã  mÃ£o"". Buscador de backrow. Esse Deck ama backrow, mas nÃ£o o suficiente para 3 Hagith. Eu gosto de usar sÃ³ 1 porque o que nÃ£o falta Ã© jeito de buscar ou reciclar ele nesse deck.</p>
<p>""Och"": ""Se este card for invocado por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual: vocÃª pode comprar 1 card e descartar 1 card"". Mas esse nÃ£o Ã© o talento dele. Ele se diferencia dos outros LV 4 porque pode invocar da mÃ£o qualquer Monstro Ritual em Velocidade de Magia 2. Ã por causa desse carinha que a galera gosta tanto de rodar ""ShinobarÃ£o PavÃ£o"" (""Shinobaron Peacock""). Roda de preferÃªncia 1 pelo mesmo motivo que o ""Hagith"".</p>
<p></p>
<p>Grupo 3: ""Phul"", o Foda</p>
<p></p>
<p>""MegÃ¡lito Phul"" Ã© um Monstro Ritual de nÃ­vel 2 que ""Se este card for invocado por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual: vocÃª pode dar alvo em 1 Monstro Ritual no seu GY; o seu LV se torna igual ao alvo e depois adicione o alvo Ã  mÃ£o"". AlÃ©m disso, ""Durante a Fase Principal (Efeito RÃ¡pido): vocÃª pode ativar este efeito; Invoque 1 Monstro Ritual ""MegÃ¡lito"" da sua mÃ£o ou deck tributando monstros da mÃ£o e/ou campo cuja soma dos LVs seja igual ou maior que o LV do monstro invocado"". Ele busca, recicla e pode interromper o turno do oponente. SÃ³ seria melhor se desse um impeachment no Salnorabo. Se puder, roda 5.</p>
<p></p>
<p>O Problema do Deck</p>
<p></p>
<p>O problema Ã© que os Monstros Rituais do arquÃ©tipo necessÃ¡rios para comeÃ§ar a invocar outros monstros sÃ£o de nÃ­vel 8, ou seja, nÃ£o podem ser buscados com ""PreparaÃ§Ã£o de Rituais"" (English: ""Preparation of Rites""), muito menos por ""PrÃ©-PreparaÃ§Ã£o de Rituais"" (English: ""Pre-Preparation of Rites""), o que reduz muito a consistÃªncia necessÃ¡ria para fazer o que o Deck deveria fazer. O arquÃ©tipo conta com alternativas de busca, por meio dos monstros de LV 4 e LV 2, mas que, para buscarem, precisam ser invocados por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual (ï½¡Åï¹Å). O Deck tambÃ©m conta com uma Magia RÃ¡pida que invoca por InvocaÃ§Ã£o Ritual 1 ""MegÃ¡lito"" direto do deck, que, por ser uma Magia RÃ¡pida, tambÃ©m nÃ£o pode usufruir de suportes genÃ©ricos de Rituais, dependendo, assim, dos meios do prÃ³prio Deck.</p>
<p>Â AÃ­ entram os ""DiabretiÃ§os"", que nÃ£o sÃ³ aumentam a consistÃªncia do Deck, buscando as cartas Rituais chaves do Deck, mas tambÃ©m gera monstros para tributar para InvocaÃ§Ãµes Ritual, sem falar nos combos com ""Soberano da Vaidade"" (""Vanity's Ruler"") e o ""Zaborg o Mega Monarca"" (""Zaborg the Mega Monarch""). SÃ³ que ""MegÃ¡lito"", por nÃ£o ter Magias de Rituais prÃ³prias, deixa embaÃ§ado para usar o ""Velaneco"" (""Impcantation Candoll"") e o ""Livropedra"" (""Impcantation Brookstone""), restando praticamente metade da engine.</p>
<p>Fora tudo isso, eu me canso fÃ¡cil quando diferentes Decks, por terem a mesma engine (""Nekroz"", ""Shinobird"", etc.), acabam ficando repetitivos e, por fim, enjoativo para a minha gameplay. Por isso eu tento misturar com outras engines para variar, por exemplo, trocar os ""DiabretiÃ§os"" por ""Dogmatikas"" ao jogar de ""Nekroz"".</p>
<p>DaÃ­ eu comecei a gastar massa cinzenta para deixar o ""MegÃ¡lito'' mais diferente de outros Decks que rodam a mesma engine.</p>
<p>EntÃ£o, depois de gastar muito ATP e horas de experimentaÃ§Ã£o, acabei com a seguinte lista. Vamos abordar o que tÃªm de diferenÃ§a de outras builds comuns de ""MegÃ¡litos''.</p>
<p></p>
<p>""DragÃ£o Branco de Olhos Azuis"" (""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"") e ""DragÃ£o de Alexandrita"" (""Alexandrite Dragon""): alvo para as ""Artes de Ritual'' para trazer os monstros dos dois grupos. A escolha desses dois monstros se dÃ¡ principalmente pelo LV 4 e 8, e tambÃ©m por terem a capacidade mÃ¡xima de ATK dentre os vanillas.</p>
<p>""Arte de Ritual AvanÃ§ada"": ajuda bastante a pÃ´r os primeiros monstros em campo sem gastar muito esforÃ§o, por enviarem os tributos do Deck. Te ajuda, tambÃ©m, a economizar os Rituais de LV 8 para que vocÃª possa usÃ¡-los de forma mais agressiva. E, por Ãºltimo mas nÃ£o menos importante, vocÃª tem mais alvos para ""Velaneco"" e ""Livropedra"", deixando eles mais viÃ¡veis e o Deck mais consistente. Esse Ãºltimo argumento tambÃ©m serve para a ""Arte de Ritual Superior"".</p>
<p>""Arte de Ritual Superior"": Traz Monstros do Deck. Ãtimo para trazer os LVs 4 pro campo e realizar as buscas e Ã³timo tambÃ©m para deixar os LVs 8 tambÃ©m mais acessÃ­veis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ConclusÃ£o</p>
<p>Acredito que tenha resolvido os problemas do Deck que apontei anteriormente por meio dessas aÃ§Ãµes. NÃ£o tenho nada contra as engines genÃ©ricas, tanto que atÃ© continuei as utilizando. SÃ³ acho que quando roda o ""Soberano da Vaidade""/""Mega Zaborg"" fica meio repetitivo e reduz a versatilidade do Deck, deixando a condiÃ§Ã£o de vitÃ³ria dependente de poucas cartas que nÃ£o sÃ£o tÃ£o acessÃ­veis o tempo todo.</p>
<p>Apesar disso tudo, nÃ£o acho que ele tenha ficado OP Tier 0 1 card combo, mas acredito que desse jeito seja a forma mais divertida e consistente que vocÃª pode esperar desse Deck atÃ© entÃ£o.</p>
<p>ValeuzÃ£o! Espero ter ajudado! E atÃ© a prÃ³xima ideiaâ¦ ...se pÃ¡</p>

Monster ratios are the same, I feel pretty good about them.

9 hand traps is pretty standard right now, will probably throw in chalice post BODE. You always have more handtraps in the side deck.

I'm considering swapping Gold Sarc + Dotscaper for two One-Time Passcode. The deck just really needs all the extenders it can get to beat established boards.

I was able to pick up a playset of TTT. The draw two after getting interrupted can help you pivot into an accesscode/final sigma play. Crossout might be decent, but I prefer the flexibility of TTT.

You don't need to know everything about Subterror archtype to use this deck, but because Subterror cards here have some unique effects, its better if you read them carefully.

The reason to Dragoon be here and not DPhoenix Enforcer is because you will almost never special summon and when you do, then you probably won't need Dragoon because of Guru effects.

Experimenting with a smaller and affordable Zeus package in the extra, you could probably cut Omega or a Bearbrumm if you wanted to play with Downerd and Sky Cavalry. Fraktall/Kitt/Tenki + any Tri-Brigade monster in hand will get you to Apollousa + Revolt. Rescue Cat also gets you full combo with Apollousa + Revolt as well. Use the Gamma in hand on your turn to prevent you opponent from using Ash/Skull Meister on your Rescue Cat/Fraktall. I cut Rescue Cat to 2 copies because after the first resolves the 2nd is usually dead with no targets in deck for you to summon. Also options to switch the cards in the extra deck around to potentially play Daruma Doll, a 3rd Shuraig, a larger Zeus package, or even a Dragoon/Phoenix Enforcer engine. This deck is very fun :)"

Let's goooooooooo!,"<span><strong>Hello there,</strong></span>

this is my new attempt on the Majespecter archetype.

It is more of a ""pure"" version of the deck and I think this way, it is much stronger!

<span><strong>Strategy</strong></span>

The Strat is simple, set scales, pendulum summon as much as you can, search for traps and stop your opponent from playing Yu-Gi-OH! !!

Turn three, you try to otk with <a data-name=""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"">Number S39: Utopia the Lightning</a>. (that is also your plan going second)

<span><strong>Card highlights</strong></span>

<span><strong><a data-name=""Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA"">Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA</a> -</strong></span> ME-PSY-YA is a very powerful new pendulum card. It is a generic low scale with no restrictions, but an interesting floodgate effect. It banishes all spell and trap cards that would go to the GY while placed in the pendulum zone. This effect helps against decks that rely on floating or recycling spell and trap cards like Sky Striker and Eldlich. ME-PSY-YA' monster effect is quite strong as well, but not too important for this deck. Its main purpose is to be a low scale for the deck.

<span><strong><a data-name=""Saambell the Star Bonder"">Saambell the Star Bonder</a> -</strong></span> While Saambell is not as strong as I initially believed, it is shares the same type and attribute as the Majespectors. It is a target for <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a> and helps to go into Totem Bird, thanks to it being level three.

<span><strong><a data-name=""Servant of Endymion"">Servant of Endymion</a> -</strong></span> Servant's only purpose is to be a low scale for the deck while also being a target for <a data-name=""Ties of the Brethren"">Ties of the Brethren</a>. Together with <a data-name=""Spell Power Mastery"">Spell Power Mastery</a>, I play three copies of it.

<span><strong><a data-name=""Secret Village of the Spellcasters"">Secret Village of the Spellcasters</a> -</strong></span> Village is a difficult one. I have seen many deck lists maining Village. The problem I see is that the Majespecters are getting tributed from the field to activate their traps and spells, eventually leaving you with no spellcasters on the field, resulting in Village to lock you down and not your opponent. Maybe I am too paranoid in that regard. It is still a strong floodgate against certain decks, so I decided to play it in the side deck.

&nbsp;

The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.

Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)

Have a nice day, everyone!"

But the deck is still playable, i want to show you how IÂ´m playing today.

The Main focus depends on the consistency while you try to combo. 3 copies of Polymerisation and 3 copies of Prank-kids Pandemonium are important to play through interruptions. To punish interruptions, 3 copies of Triple Tactics Talent does also a good job.

Pot of Desires is optional. The funktion of this card is getting faster into the game, but the card also hurtÂ´s your grind game a lot. You can chance it to pot of avarice (for a very good grind game version) or to more interruptions like main decking nibiru, or even solemn judgement (when going first). Lock-down like Mystic Mine is also possible.

So try it out, itÂ´s personally one of my favourite decks.

Have fun!"

With any other card on the field that eats the Scrap Wyvern Pop instead of Scrap Wyvern itself, including an opponent's card, random backrow, or extra extender, your end board turns into 2 Fog Blades, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Babel letting you use Orcust quick effects, a quick effect Dingirsu special summon in a zone Bardiche points to for quick double removal, and Crossrose Dragon summoning Black Rose Moonlight Dragon to bounce your opponent's first special summon.

At the very least it has potential, I actually like the synergies between it an Eldlich. But ultimately I think a purer version of the deck can still compete. Don't get me wrong, there are reasons the deck is underexplored, and it probably won't be a tier 1 strategy any time soon, but the core of the deck is really good. You Normal Summon Serziel, then turn his ability on with Evil Eye of Selene, giving you one pop on an opponent's turn and a boss monster with great protection. This 1 card 1 interruption schtick has proven to be good enough in the past, and having other useful spells and traps to search if you see the Evil Eye of Selene is pretty boss too. In addition, it has a Field Spell that searches it.

So, when building an Evil Eye deck you have to consider which element to build around, are you a more ""combo""ish Zerziel Turbo or are you Serziel Stun. The elements for both of these are okay. I ultimately decided on playing a very small Evil Eye package featuring none of the extra-deck monsters. I think this plays to Serziel's strengths better than playing the more comboish version, and I discovered this when melding the engine with Eldlich. You don't actually need to play a lot of Evil Eye cards outside of the core engine, the combos you are giving up aren't good enough, whereas Serziel by itself if at the very least close. My thought was to make this a dumb trap deck - summon Serziel, set 4 backrow is the nuts in this deck.

So, I started with tech cards. I'm not sure I'll stick to this system, but for now deciding on Tech Cards first is something I'm adopting into my deckbuilding process. This allows me to figure out what interactions I am playing ahead of my engine, so that I'm less inclined to ""cut"" tech cards in my deckbuilding process. Solemn Judgement IMO is obligatory in this type of deck - if you're playing a trap deck Lightning Storm and Evenly Matched and even Twin Twisters will ruin your day if you don't run this card. It could easily be in the side for games 2 and 3 but I like the card and it is a staple in my decks, because it is so versatile and powerful. Solemn Strike was added in the same breath, it's just a strong versatile card that is great going first and still very good going second, and a staple in successful Trap decks. Next I wanted a little spice. 2 Dogmatika Punishment made a lot of sense to me, but I wanted to run Trap Trick for essentially extra copies of this. With Trap Trick you're effectively running 4 Dogmatika Punishment for some purposes, but won't mind seeing the two of them together. For hand Traps I'm running 3 Imperm and 3 Dimension Shifter. Imperm is high enough impact, and doubles as a useful spell for Trap Trick to set, that it is worth running. D Shifter is potentially huge, we don't really play the GY game in this version of the deck and D Shifter is such a high impact hand trap that it is absolutely worth maining in basically any deck that can run it. Then I'm running 2 Evil Eye Retribution. You need at least 1 copy of this for when you see Evil Eye of Selene, but I think 2 gives us 5 cards Lightning Storm which is huge IMO. It also can't be negated if you have Evil Eye of Selene equipped to Serziel, though the downside is it does nothing if you don't see a Serziel. Evil Eye Defeat is also a huge interaction card, basically a 2 for 1 if you're strategy is online. We would only run 1 of these for the purposes of searching, but we need 2 to be able to use this off of Trap Trick. This way Trap Trick should almost always have something to set (and usually activate on resolution).

The next step was to throw in my Pot cards. As I said, you really need to see Serziel for the deck to do its thing, and the fact that it can play Prosperity and Duality for free is actually a huge upside for the deck. The pots don't even conflict, it is so insane.

After that it is 3 of the Field Spell with Terraforming, 3 Serziel, and 1 Evil Eye of Selene, your brick or Taketemborg for the engine. Evil Eye of Selene can reset itself, , so I think 1 copy of it is fine. It does leave you a little more vulnerable to Twin Twisters, but not by much. The Field Spell is always better to see than Serziel himself, since when Serziel pops you own card you can give up the Field Spell instead of something valuable. Regardless, I think you need all 7 copies of Serziel to play the Evil Eye engine. Sadly, you really don't need much else.

That left 6 spots in the deck, which was just perfect. I wanted to run packages of Floodgates that combo together, and to avoid bricking I thought packages of 2 made a lot of sense. So from just having put in everything I wanted I had the exact room to put in 2 Rivalry, the weakest floodgate but meta relevant and combos with There Can Be Only One, There Can Be Only One, the strongest individual floodgate that again combos with Rivalry of Warlords, and Summon Limit, which doesn't directly combo with either but puts a second limitation on opponents that combined with the first will frustrate them. These also have the advantage of being continuous spells, meaning you can pop them with Evil Eye cards after they've already done their job.

Punishment really didn't jive with the D Shifter in the deck, so it got cut for an Artifact Package. What is nice is that popping these cards yourself with Serziel lets you pop another card, so even if Scythe is dead Sanctum still puts in work in this deck. Scythe is also just really good, and is even half-decent to set a lot of the time.

In tuning I settled on a second copy of Selene because while it can be bricky, seeing it is nice, and it gives the deck a backup plan if your first is banished. I actually basically did what I always do and rebuilt the deck from the bottom up again, this time incorporating a couple copies of Zombie World. This card is decent as a floodgate in it's own right right now, but is notable for combing with Rivalry and There Can Be Only One very effectively. The idea is to have floodgates that are good on their own, but also combo with each other, and Zombie World fits that bill right now. The other notable new inclusion is 2 copies of crackdown. Much as I love the artifact engine in Evil Eye, when you only have 2 spaces to fill Crackdown is notable for stealing an opponent's monster to pop once it's on your side of the field, and means we might actually use our extra deck when our floodgates will let us. I still think 5 spell/trap negates is plenty, since when you see 1 of your copies of Selene you can search Retribution."

<span>The goal of this deck is to summon either <strong><a data-name=""Gren Maju Da Eiza"">Gren Maju Da Eiza</a></strong> or <strong><a data-name=""Calculator"">Calculator</a></strong> and make both of them gain tremendous ATK and DEF points with the help of Shiranuis. Shiranuis are good at swarming and banishing themselves out of the play to activate their innate effects. They can also return either to the field, GY or deck with the help of their support cards.</span>

<strong><span>Gren Maju Strategy:</span></strong>
<span>Using the effects of <strong>Dimensional Fissure</strong>, <strong>Pot of Desires</strong>, <strong>Pot of Extravagance</strong>, <strong>Golden Castle of Stromberg</strong>, <strong>Pot of Prosperity</strong>, <strong>Shiranui Style Samsara</strong>, <strong>Shiranui Squiresaga</strong> and <strong>Shiranui Samurai</strong>, this will increase Gren Maju Da Eiza's ATK and DEF dramatically. (possible ATK/DEF gain: 20,000+)</span>

<strong><span>Tips:</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><em><span><strong>Pot of Desires</strong> is good if you already have Gren Maju during your first 5 draws. You can just banish cards without worry. It is best paired during the first draw with anti-summon, anti-spells/traps and anti-monster effect cards like <strong>Solemns, Ash Blossom </strong>and<strong> Ice Dragon's Prison</strong>.</span></em></li>
 	<li><em><span>If you don't have Gren Maju during your first 5 draws, swarm the field with Shiranuis and use them as a material to link summon <strong>Shiranui Skillsaga Supremacy</strong> which has a beneficial effect for FIRE monsters in which they can't be destroyed by battle. With this, once you summon Gren Maju, it will not be destroyed by battle and you can use cards that can banish other cards freely.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<strong><span>Calculator Strategy:</span></strong>
<span>By swarming the field with high level Shiranui Synchro monsters, you can dramatically increase Calculator's ATK. (possible ATK gain: 11,400. This is the sum of all Shiranui Synchro Monsters except 1 <strong>Shiranui Samuraisaga</strong> just to have a space for calculator to be summoned.)</span>

<strong><span>Tips:</span></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Prevent Calculator's destruction by using your anti-magic/trap/summon/monster effect cards.</span></li>
