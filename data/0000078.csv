This deck isn't exactly perfect, so you can mess with the ratios if you want. It's a godless combination of Relinquished and a small Blue-Eyes engine. It does things. You can use White Stone of Ancients to either ritual Relinquished off of the actual ritual spell, or synchro into Formula Synchron, which will give a Blue-Eyes in the end phase to make Leo with on your opponents turn. Relinquished Fusion is a quick play, so you can summon Thousand-Eyes during the battle phase to save you a turn. Chaos MAX is in there because as long as I have Advance ritual art and Blue-Eyes, why not. Honestly this deck can do some cool things, but can brick harder than my jumpshot. Try it out if you want to have some fun."

Raviel and Hamon each have 4000 ATK, so Beatdown is the name of the game. If you are going up against a Mystic Mine Stall/Burn deck (which didn't get hit at all on the banlist), you can use Exodia, because you can draw out your entire deck very quickly.

Hero Malicious, Destrudo, etc.,) I have been experimenting with using more cards from the zombie archetype. Since the deck has two natural targets for Cyrstron Halqifibrax's effect to summon a level 3 or lower tuner to your field in the form of Glow-Up Bloom and Uni-Zombie the number of brick-hands has been practically eliminated. The ideal going-first board can be achieved with a relatively consistent 3 combo;  Drawing a play starter (Shiranui Solitaire, Uni-Zombie, or Gozuki,) discard fodder (Necroworld Banshee, or Mezuki,) and any other extender/ free summon (Jack-o-Bolan, Danger! Mothman!, etc.) With a variation of these 3 cards alone it is possible to achieve an end-board of Zombie World, Doomking Balerdroch/Jack-o-Bolan (whichever you want to make off of Glow-Up Bloom,) Artifact Dagda, Artifact Scythe in the spell/trap zone and a Crystron Halqifibrax. During your opponent's main-phase you can activate Halqifibrax to summon T.G. Wonder Magician and destroy the set Artifact Scythe, triggering its effect to summon and lock your opponent out of their extra deck. Whenever your opponent summons or activates a card you can use Wonder Magician's effect to synchro summon with Scythe and make Shiranui Sunsaga, allowing an additional disruption in the form of destroying an opponent's card by shuffling back the Wonder Magician (not to mention at any time during all this you can chain to a monster effect to banish a monster from the field or grave, or negate a monster effect with Balerdroch.)

The deck's main offensive feature is the bouncing of threats with The Weather Thundery Canvas, which can lead to your opponent's boards being made completely obsolete.

Another useful feature of the deck is that it is difficult for your opponent to prevent the activations of your spells and traps because usually you won't be activating them, you will insteaed be ""placing"" them directly from your deck which doesn't count as an activation, thankfully.

You also have access to The Weather Painter Sun, which can be used to make The Weather Painter Rainbow and then make its negation clause live almost immediately. Allowing you quick access to what is, in essence, three omni-negates and a copy of Solemn Warning with 2400 attack points.

Also in the deck you have access to both Borreload and Borrelsword, which can both lead to quick OTKs with their high attack points and steal effect.

Really devastating buster blader deck. comment what you think. And enjoy. ,"okay so the strategy is pretty straight forward, the goal is to have a finish board of Buster dragon, Dragon destroyer and Vortex for negate.
easiest way to get there is:

either normal summon or special summon (using its effect) Darkwurm to bring Gate zero to your hand. ( if you use darkwurm as a discard for pendulum call, it’s an easy plus 2; bringing harmonizing and white wing to your hand).

If you still have a normal summon summon a level 4 or lower dragon monster. Buster welp’s effect adds destruction fusion to your hand. But if it dracoslayer that’s fine too. Link summon into Romulus, adding dragon ravine to your hand. Discard a card a send tempest to your graveyard (unless it break your scale)

use gate zero and any 8 scale apart from harmonizing magician for your pendulum scale. (harmonizing is to valuable when pendulum summoned but if it has to be done it has to be). Pendulum summon the harmonizing, darkwurm from your extra deck and dracoslayer if you have it, white wing magician if you have it and leave a zone open.

Upon pendulum summoning harmonizing special summon dragoncaller from you deck. And sychro summon Star eater. (Due to dragoncaller a effect if it attacks a dragon monster then it’s attack becomes 6400).

link summon Elpy and pisty using darkwurm and other level 4 or lower dragon monster. Special summon another darkwurm from your deck. Sychro Summon Buster dragon in defense using white wing and darkwurm. (This turns all opponents monster to dragons). Then special summon another dragon from your grave yard using pisty.

link summon skull dread using pisty, Elpy, Romulus and dragon to break guardragon lock. Drawing 4 cards, if you don’t already have destruction fusion in your hand then hopefully you draw it. If not add level 7 monster. (If you have another card in your hand so you can have a level 7 and destruction fusion then that’s the best) skull dreads effect to special summon level 7 and activate tempest effect banishing Elpy and pisty to special summon itself. Xyz summon odd-eyes absolute then link summon into galaxy satellite using absolute and skull dread. Which special summons odd-eyes vortex.
attack if you feel like.

if galaxy satellite is still on the field at the end of your opponents turn put buster blader or destruction fusion on top of your deck.

next turn is simple fusion summon dragon destroyer. Attack. ( if you are not going to end the duel by attack or it’s negated don’t worry) in main phase 2 pendulum summon any monster and link into protector welp, if you did not attack with dragon destroyer upon ending your turn protector welp then does damage to your opponent equal to dragon destroyers attack (which if there’s dragons on the field or graveyard then that’s quite a lot).

but that’s it, get your game on and high five the sky."

Increased deck consistency. (10 copies of golden castle.)
Improved chances of defeating unbeatable monsters. (2 copies of Lava Golem).
Less chances of getting bricked. (Magical mallet)
Overall 77% increase in fun and enjoyment.

Other tactics: (read first the original strategy <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/fun-castle-combo-deck/"">here.)</a>
◘ If somehow you didn't got 4 cards to summon saryuja skull dread, summon bow of the goddess.
◘ When there is atleast 20 banished cards you can summon topologic zeroboros for an epic finish.
◘ Use trade-in with 'Danger!' cards or Gizmek Orochi so you can activate their effects.

List of things that can still beat this deck:
◘ First turn shaddoll deck.
◘ First turn herald of perfection deck.
◘ Skilled salamangreat user.
◘ Kaiju-Lunalight deck.
◘ That combined time-thief with heraldic beasts and psy-frames deck.
◘ That power rangers quantum layer deck.
◘ Handtraps."

This deck is unfortunetly not a budget option (rip destrudo), in this deck I play more Rokkets than other monsters.

Like in most decks You must play a few bricks.

Galactic Spiral Dragon is not a brick here but a ""free cost"",

You can discard him for Dragon Ravine, Twin Twister or Quadborrel and then return him from the gy to the field to make Harbinger.

&nbsp;

Basic combo start for Dummies:

1. Summon any Rokket or best case scenario Seyfert.

1.1. Special summon if You are able Absorouter.

1.2. If you summoned Sefert you go ""one card combo"".

1.2.1. Tribute Seyfert for Collapserpent -&gt; banish Seyfert -&gt; Link Collapserpent into Striker -&gt; add Boot Sector -&gt; special Wyverbuster -&gt; etc.

1.1.2 Link monster into Striker -&gt; add Boot Sector -&gt; link Absorouter and Striker into Romulus -&gt; chain1-Romulus chain2-Absorouter -&gt; etc.

2. At the end You usually have board with Spheres, Harbinger and Savage.

I could probably commit some grammar crimes, I'm not a native speaker.

Have fun and remember Dragon bullets for live~"

There's also a DNA surgery in it for non dragon type decks. Does it work?

Also we can easily make use of <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</a> and preventing our opponent from summoning monster from the extra deck(Honestly I have no idea why Konami did not hit this card instead of destrudo). Anyway the typical board ends on <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a>, <a data-name=""Naturia Exterio"">Naturia Exterio</a>, <a data-name=""i:p Masquerena"">i:p Masquerena</a>, <a data-name=""Union Carrier"">Union Carrier</a>, <a data-name=""Doomking"">Doomking</a>(equipped with <a data-name=""Dragon Buster Destruction Sword"">Dragon Buster Destruction Sword</a>) and in some rare cases even<a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda""> El Shaddoll Winda</a> aswell. If you have any questions about the combos, ratios or anything feel free 2 leave a comment.

&nbsp;

The deck is relatively consistent and you will likely have a Redoer turn 1 at least though you can set up far more than that if the cards in your hand are good enough. the real issues for the deck mostly come in the form of towers monsters which the deck can really struggle to beat over outside of utopia double or in draguns case trying to bounce it with Redoer's trap effect. Other than that the deck has the same good/bad match ups as strikers and thief typically do with the exception of shaddoll which Redoer's effect will trigger when detached.

The 2 widow anchor is definitely nice to have back but the deck will need more to ever make a splash on the meta again besides new main deck stuff."

Use cards like Nightmare's Steelcage and Gravity Bind to stop your opponents from attacking with there most powerful monsters. The get a revival jam on the field. You can activate Jam Defender and place some more monsters on the field, like Humanoid slime or Man-Eater Bug as a defense, and then you can summon and attack with Jinzo #7, who won't be effected by Gravity Bind, and can attack directly. By this time you might have Wave-Motion Cannon, and this can pretty much make you auto win if you've waited enough turns. After some more turns go by, you can use a combined effort of Wave-Motion Cannon and Gem flash (and also Jinzo#7) energy to deplete your opponents LP, and keep using Revival Jam as the ultimate defense, continuing to revive it! Of course, things might not always go this way, and we have XYZ's and Links, who don't have levels. You can easily destroy these monsters with Raigeki, plus you have other good spell and trap cards to foil your opponents plans as well, like Mystical Space Typhoon and Divine Wrath. If you don't have Raigeki, or it gets destroyed some how, you can use a better alternative to get rid of your opponents monsters: Lava Golem. Lava golem gets rid of two of your opponents monsters AND does 1000 damage to them turn after turn. And if you still have a Gravity Bind on the field, It won't be able to attack. If none of that works though, and you don't get lucky enough for the perfect strategy above, believe in the heart of the cards more! And try this next strategy. Using some new strategy, you can get Metal Reflect Slime on the field fairly easily, and with it protecting your LP get some more monsters on the field, protecting them with spells and traps. The easiest way to get quick monsters with this deck it to activate Jam Breeding Machine, summoning you some little jam tokens every turn. Now, once you have some Jams on your side, activate Mystical Space Typhoon, and get rid of your ow Spell: Jam Breeding Machine. With that card of the field, you can summon Slifer the Sky Dragon! If you don't have or have already used all your Mystical Space Typhoons, wait until your opponent destroys Jam Breeding Machine with one of there effects. People do that a lot when I duel them with this deck for some reason. Next use fusion sage if you've got it from the side deck, or use polymerization if you have it to fuse Slifer and Metal Reflect Slime to summon Egyptian God Slime! This card is practically unbeatable, not being able to be destroyed by battle, or targeted by card effects. This card can then destroy your opponent (with some help from the rest of your amazing deck) insuring victory. I know that you probs won't always be in the best position for one of these strategies, but there are many more inside the deck to explore. Have fun with this deck. It's surprisingly good. Btw in the extra deck a Fiber Jars, they are a banned card but if your playing for fun with no banned cards it's cool to have in the deck. (This is an updated version because my last didn't include polymerization.)"

Use cards like Nightmare's Steelcage and Gravity Bind to stop your opponents from attacking with there most powerful monsters. The get a revival jam on the field. You can activate Jam Defender and place some more monsters on the field, like Humanoid slime or Man-Eater Bug as a defense, and then you can summon and attack with Jinzo #7, who won't be effected by Gravity Bind, and can attack directly. By this time you might have Wave-Motion Cannon, and this can pretty much make you auto win if you've waited enough turns. After some more turns go by, you can use a combined effort of Wave-Motion Cannon and Gem flash (and also Jinzo#7) energy to deplete your opponents LP, and keep using Revival Jam as the ultimate defense, continuing to revive it!

<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Key goal – get a gladiator beast &amp; non-gladiator beast monster on board (and ideally and extender in hand)</li>
 	<li>Whenever tenyi spirit vishuda is summoned, link it away for monk of the tenyi and use vishuda GY effect before continuing combos</li>
 	<li>Generally always want to summon GB domitianus first (protect against nibiru) and summon GB heraklinos second to protect against evely matched etc.</li>
 	<li>Can replace ash blossom with nibiru or mind control to increase combo potential in a go second strategy fully committed to board-breaking</li>
 	<li>Budget builds should replace 3x evenly matched with 1x rescue rabbit and 2x world legacy succession, and shift focus from a board-breaking go second strategy to a more balanced combo-centric strategy</li>
 	<li>Pot of desires may limit/dictate what combos you have access to, but the number of different combos as well as the consistency increase PoD provides outweighs the limitations</li>
 	<li>Apollousa not necessary for this build (though would be a good option) – decode talker has more utility with the going second aim of the deck to assist OTK potential whilst requiring one less link material</li>
 	<li>Vishuda &amp; adhara have some level of recursiveness with each other if needed in the grind game</li>

If they don't negate anything, Normal Summon Darklord Morningstar using Condemned Darklord's effect and try to get some Level 8s (Superbia/Zerato) or Level 10s (2 Ixchels) to go into Xyz plays. If the opponent isn't immune to destruction effects, Xyz Summon Number 35: Ravenous Tarantula to get rid of all their monsters, otherwise, summon Dingirisu, use its effect, and then Rank Up into Number 77: The Seven Sins by summoning Number 84: Pain Gainer.

I picked Dangers! as a side engine for more draw power and the ability to get rid of certain cards in your hand, which Darklords can use in the GY. Bigfoot and Thunderbird were chosen specifically because they're Allure of Darkness and Trade-In targets and they can also pop cards if you need them to.

Monster Gate and Reasoning serve as potential millers for the deck, which can also lead into easy Special Summons. Be aware that any Nasten or Ixchel that you already Special Summoned this turn will just get milled if Monster Gate or Reasoning got it. Morningstar will always be milled because it can't be Special Summoned. For Reasoning, your opponent will most likely guess Level 8 if they know the Darklord matchup.

The most common way to turbo out a Morningstar is by using Ixchel and discarding another Darklord monster, drawing 2, and then using Darklord Contact to Special Summon Ixchel and then the other Darklord. Do this the other way around if you discard Superbia with Ixchel's effect. Link those 2 Darklords into Condemned Darklord, then use its effect (preferably discard a Darklord Trap or a Danger! Monster) and search for Morningstar. Use Morningstar's effect to swarm the board with huge Darklords and then go into your plays from there.

The main weaknesses to Darklords as an archetype are basically backrow removal and their dependence on Special Summoning and draw power. DROLL &amp; LOCK BIRD IS REALLY ANNOYING FOR THIS DECK. Zombie World changes your gameplan of Summoning Morningstar because Condemned Darklord requires Fairy Monsters. This means Zombie World also makes Superbia's effect not work. Because the deck is mostly Dark-Attribute, that does mean your opponent can use Super Polymerization to summon Starving Venom Fusion Dragon, so be aware that they can disrupt your plays that way.

However, they are really good at non-targeting effects, as all of their Trap cards don't target and Dingirsu has non-targeting removal. They're also really great at summoning a bunch of high ATK/DEF monsters to the field if your opponent isn't the strongest against high ATK/DEF swarm.

For the side deck, I have 3 Twin Twisters for the backrow removal issue, 2 Darklord Tezcatlipoca if you need an extra Darklord with the Spell/Trap effect, 2 The Sanctified Darklord in case I need to search for effect negation or mill it with Ukoback, 2 Archlord Kristya for another Trade-In target and in case I need to lock my opponent out of Special Summoning, and 2 Michion, the Timelord for another Level 10 and for huge damage (Xyz into Gustav Max in MP2 to do even more).

Other side deck cards (these might change later on) are Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe, Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld, Five-Headed Link Dragon (it does come up sometimes), and Topologic Bomber Dragon."

Then again, with Merfae Hide-and-Seek the deck has a really solid plan to win in the grind-game. I feel like the deck would struggle at the competitive level, largely because of the timer, but also because it's weak, and also highly skill-intensive to pilot, since your plays happen on your opponent's turn. You have to finish setting up while they're setting up, and then know when to do everything to get the most value and that also means understanding your opponent's deck. So if that sounds like your kind of game plan, you could probably pilot it to moderate success. They ARE cute AF tho, and stronger in practice than they look on paper."

ABC and Dangers have such amazing synergy it's shocking that it's been overlooked in favour of the Infinity build with the upcoming Union support. Given that almost every player anticipates the Infinity build being the main ABC build for the new format, this version often ends up being a deadly surprise.

What surprised me most when testing this build was how flexible the extra deck is. The Dangers, Destrudo and Gizmek allow the opportunity to use so many cards for going both first and second that at times I've struggled to find a permanent setup. Once the meta defines itself, the extra can be tailored to be a lot more specific.

The side deck is pretty general right now. Can easily be tailored to the format, but i'm pretty happy with it as an initial start.

Once the Mine is activated, the next step will be to leave the support cards such as Dark Bribe (denier), Field Barrier (obviously, field protector), Threatening Roar (insurance in case the mine is destroyed) and Demise of the Land or Metaverse (so that if the mine is destroyed we can bring another one immediately). Obviously we cannot play all of them, we will have to be smart to know which ones should be left on the field; the optimum is 2 although as long as we have no more than 3 it will be fine although we can have complications with cards that need to stay on the field like Shard of Greed. To help us find the cards we need, we have a good variety of draw cards (be careful, you should not underestimate the draw power of the deck, I have mistakenly burned it all for activating cards without seeing how many cards were left in the deck).

Last and most importantly, the win conditions. Of course we have Exodia, the king of the Deck who with so many draw cards and our safeguard strategy will not be very difficult to get, and we have Final Countdown too that gives us an extra win condition (I do not recommend activating it without at least 25 cards remaining especially if they are in a tournament and there is little time left since we could lose for LP).

The Extra Deck can be anything since we will only use it to activate Pot of Extravagance although we can make a good security strategy with Linkuriboh, Almiraj and Gardna although we will have activated Final Countdown or have done side deck Dark Factory (or both) or practically we can give up (in any case I don't recommend summoning monsters since that could give our opponent the opportunity to purposely keep a single monster to destroy the Mine by its own effect in case we don't have Field Barrier, it's difficult but it is not about giving opportunities to our opponent).

Finally, the Side Deck does not need much explanation; Dark Factory in case our opponent has what to send the exodia pieces to the cemetery with, foolish burial is by itself only one piece was sent to the cemetery we can send another to activate the effect of Dark Factory, Cosmic Cyclone can help us to activate Hope for Escape and the rest of the cards you just have to be wise to know what to change, it is what will help us win.

NOTE: I know that Pot of Extravagance is very expensive so if you don't have it and you can't afford it I suggest Jar of Greed to replace it. Of course it is not the same but the strategy of activating 3 Reckless Greed at the same time will not be difficult and sending 10 cards from the deck to the cemetery with Pot of Desires is not a very good idea playing Exodia so I consider it the best option (I accept suggestions).

Going 2nd is the best thing if you want to make a disaster, but if you go 1st you could block your opponent summoning both Rafale and Wiz, so you will have 2 negation. You could play cards as There Can Be Only One or some Solemn cards to block opponent's combos.

The main combo is:

Normal summon Beat, Special Summon another Fur Hire Monster with Beat's effect and search for Rafale (or another Fur Hire if you already have Rafale in your hand), Special summon Another Fur Hire Monster and special summon Rafale as the 4th monster triggering his effect and adding a card to your hand choosing between 3 cards (better a Fur Hire monster or Eschatos). Special summon Folgo using the three Fur Hire monsters on the field (do not use Rafale) and triggering his effect special summoning Wiz. Trigger wiz's effect and gain 1000LP. So, special summon Eschatos by banishing the 3 monster you used to link summon Folgo, active his effect to cleaning the oppenent's side of the field and triggering Folgo's effect to draw 3 cards! So you can attack with Folgo (2400), Rafale (2800) and Eschatos (3000) and win the mach!

If you go 1st you can stop at the summoning of Wiz, so you will have 1 monster's effect negation and 1 spell/trap's negation. If you set cards like Called By The Grave or Solemn Warning/Strike or There Can Be Only One to block other opponent's combos, you are quite sure to start your second turn without problems.

&nbsp;

Other little tips:

If you want you can start with Reasoning. Your monsters are all of different levels and guessing the correct level will be very hard to your opponent. You can use Reasoning to restart the effects chain after a nagation too.

If your opponent negates one of your Fur Hire monster's effect, you can use Monster Gate to ""switch"" the Fur Hire monster on the field with another one and restart with the effects chain.

If you haven't enough monster to link summon Folgo, you can use One-Time Passcode to summon a cyberce-type Token and have a free material to summoning Folgo.

For the same problem, you can siding One For One and use it to sending a monster to the GY and special summon Filo from the deck, then special summon another monster from your hand and trigger Filo's effect to special summoning the monster you sent to the GY with the effect of One For One, thus having 3 monster for link summoning Folgo.

I suggest you summon Rafale under Folgo, so you can link summon Underclock Tacker on his right and active his effect to make one of your opponent's monster lose 2800 ATK and make easier to you to destroy that monster by battle.

the extra deck isn't very important: Borreload and Topologic Bomber are only supports 'cause you won't need them too much."

I build this deck to play at the incoming ygo local tournament in my city, BUT the COVID 19 has F**K everything up, so i never have a chance to try this deck in the tournament.

Although, i don't have many chance to play, i still think this is a good deck. This is a going first deck; nevertheless, it can also go second with cards like raigeki and dark ruler.

The combo of this deck is countless. However, u only need mathematician/tour guide and another card can ss from the hand like danger, block dr or dotscaper. First, u normal mathematician, send O lion to GY and ss a token, link out cherubini send graff to GY, ss a burning abyss, link out curious, send glow or dot and ss it back. Now, u can deal with the rest card in your hand and GY to ss more mons to blk your opponent field. By the way, instead of summoning curious, u can also ss dante and send the top 3 cards of your deck to GY. After u successfully blk your opponent field, u can OTK them by cards like borrelsword, mekk-knight crus avramx,...

Basically, to play this deck, u have to know all cards in your deck and improvise.

Thank you for reading (and F**K COVID 19)

Let me introduce you Pot of Avarice. ,"Engage might be gone, but the engine is all there, and it allows you to go +1 every turn.

The main strategy is starting your Sky Striker plays going second, do the Hayate-Kagari play and end with Shizuku adding 2 cards on the process.

You need 3 Roze to draw them consistently. Hayate can send Raye to the GY and don't forget to use Roze's effect.

Ghost Belle and Called by the Grave are musts against hand traps because if your cards does not resolve you cannot control the board. (Keep in mind that Belle can negate Called so that your Raye will resolve)

This is basically the same thing we've been done during the last format, but now Pot of Avarice is unlimited, and in this deck you can basically call it Pot of Greed. Now you don't need to worry about using all of your Link monsters because your're going to take them back anyways. there's no need to run Hercules Base, whose equip effect was almost never used.

Foolish Burial goods is still alive and it helps you getting your widow anchor if forced to go first. Three copies of Area Zero will help you change brick spells for your engine cards and the field's second effect is more accessible with Zeke.

Please, don't run multiple copies random Striker cards like Jamming, Eagle, Vector, Scissors. I'm using 2 Cannon and 2 Afterburners because they are really useful, but there are no excuses for running Scissor or a Second Jamming Waves, keep in mind that if your Engine is disrupted you need defense and draw power, not a third Eagle Booster.

Sky Striker Ace - Zeke is the new Link monster, and that card's effects may not impress that much but it does so much for this deck. Now you can take you opponents monsters (shark and anchor) without fearing a field miss and link them off for another Sky Striker Ace monster ending the turn with your spells on full power. The Banish effect is really convenient because it helps you clearing the board, but also versatile once you can banish himself to always have a play or banish the monster you took with Shark Cannon, so that it can attack when it comes back. Not to mention that Zeke has a down arrow which helps you making Ningirsu.

The hand traps are really important because they can fulfill your graveyard with targets for Avarice and simplify the game state. Also you can normal summon them to link scale when needed.

Pankratops is a good body that can help you outing Imperial Order, link scaling and doing that extra damage Sky Strikers Need from time to time.

Of course this deck is not good going first, but it's one card engine allows you to side whatever cards you think will perform well on the format like TCBOO, but in this case i'm running Dimensional Barrier. Against Combo decks i'm running Sphere Mode and Dark Ruler no More, but if you don't want to give away your normal summon just use Nibiru instead.

On the overall Sky Striker might not be the most explosive deck available but you have a ton of in-theme disruptions and a lot of space for extra negates which makes it playable.

The deck could be even more powerful with Mystic Mine, but i don' like that card and i think you have to play the deck in a complete different way otherwise you will just be surprised when your opponent outs it and OTKs you :)

Consistent link 4 (Giant Ogre, Apollousa, ","<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/s3NNKNn.png"" alt=""image"" />

Basic strategy is to resolve many different Gouki monsters as much as possible (minimal 2 so our Gouki Rematch is online). From there you can go for any link play while searching tons of card, my preferred end board is Apollousa + Linkuriboh/Silent Swordsman. Also dont forget to search God Phoenix Gearfried via Isolde. Going second is much easier as we can OTK with Giant Ogre or Accescode to break board + big damage (you can link climb it from Unicorn for maximum atk gain and more removal).

Expected end board:

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/hHChR4n.png"" alt=""image"" />

Pros: Very consistent, every Gouki monster replaces itself, great follow up play, great going first or second, bunch of handtraps, many possible big beater monsters (some with non-targeting removal).

Cons: First turn board isnt too strong, bad matchup against backrow deck, possible bricking with the Silent Swordsmen and handtraps."

So what can this deck do? With enough extenders you can end on a board with:
- apollousa (3 counters)
- Cyber dragon infinity
- Abyss dweller (or any other rank 4 xyz)
- Evil swarm knightmare (Equiped with Dragon buster destruction sword)
- Union carier

This wil give you 3 monster negates, 1 omni negate, no effects in grave, no special summon from the extra deck and you can set a special summond monster face down. Besides that this board is hard to supper poly. It does have a hard time against lava golem and sphere mode.
