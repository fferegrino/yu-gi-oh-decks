The main focus of the deck is to turbo out <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dominance"">Destiny HERO - Dominance</a> with <a data-name=""D - Tactics"">D - Tactics</a> on the field in order to banish your opponents cards and bring all the D - Boys back.</span>  The main combo requires either <a data-name=""Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio"">Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio</a> or <a data-name=""Lonefire Blossom"">Lonefire Blossom</a> in your hand with another monster to discard (without having <a data-name=""Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra"">Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra</a> in your hand since it turns off your combo). Normal summon either of the monsters, (Lonefire gets Scorpio from deck by tributing itself) use Scorpio's effect by discarding the monster in your hand (dont discard <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Plasma"">Destiny HERO - Plasma</a>, <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Honest Neos"">Elemental HERO Honest Neos</a>, or <a data-name=""Vision HERO Faris"">Vision HERO Faris</a> unless you need to since their effect can be useful) to special summon Cobra from your deck. Activate Cobra's effect to add Fusion Destiny to your hand. Link summon <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> right after using Cobra and Scorpio. It is important to do this before activating Fusion Destiny since it locks you into dark HEROs for the rest of the turn. Hold off until using Anaconda's effect till the end of your turn.  At this point, after summoning Anaconda, you can use Fusion Destiny to make Dominance. The material you use for Dominance depends on your hand but the best targets to use are <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Malicious"">Destiny HERO - Malicious</a>, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster"">Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster</a>, and <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Drawhand"">Destiny HERO - Drawhand</a>. Malicious is an excellent extender as all HERO players know and Dreadmaster is there for the D - Tactics combo. The reason I choose Drawhand instead of <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Disk Commander"">Destiny HERO - Disk Commander</a> as the 3rd is because if your opponent destroys your Dominance right away you can't use it's floating effect to summon the D - Boys back from the grave if you have Disk Commander (and no extra D - HEROS) since he cant be summoned from the grave the turn he is sent there. You need 3 valid targets in your grave to trigger Dominance's floating effect.  If you have <a data-name=""Allure Of Darkness"">Allure Of Darkness</a> or Destiny Draw with a Destiny HERO in your hand, use Dominance's sorting effect on your deck before using them to try and get what you need on the top. The best targets, if you don't already have them in your hand, are D - Tactics, <a data-name=""Mask Change"">Mask Change</a>, and Honest Neos. Other good cards are Plasma and Faris if you have the material to use them. If you have Mask Change you can either special summon Malicious and use it on him to make <a data-name=""Masked HERO Dark Law"">Masked HERO Dark Law</a> or set it to use it on Drawhand on your opponent's turn. If you have Faris you can use their effect to place <a data-name=""Vison HERO Increase"">Vison HERO Increase</a> in the spell/trap zone, tribute Faris, special summon itself to special summon <a data-name=""Vision Hero Vyon"">Vision Hero Vyon</a> from the deck. Use Vyon's effect to send <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Shadow Mist"">Elemental HERO Shadow Mist</a> to the grave (if you haven't already this turn) using Shadow Mist's effect to add Plasma, or whatever else you need. you can then special summon Malcious and tribute Malicious, Increase, and Vyon for Plasma.  If you are finished with all your other plays you can then use Anaconda's effect to send a different copy of Fusion Destiny from your deck to the graveyard to special summon <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dystopia"">Destiny HERO - Dystopia</a>. The materials you want to use now are <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dynatag"">Destiny HERO - Dynatag</a> and Disk Commander. If you don't have D - Tactics set you can use Dynatag's effect to banish itself to give Dystopia 1000 atk damage, enabling it's quick effect pop effect. You want to target either Drawhand or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Celestial"">Destiny HERO - Celestial</a> in your graveyard for it's burn effect on summon to do 1600 effect damage.  Your end board will most likely be Anaconda/Dominance/Dystopia with the possibility of having Plasma or Dark Law on top of that. Pretty much a board of a Drident/Skill Drain/Macro Cosmos + 1 hand rip if they search. During the standby phase use D - Tactics to boost your dude's attack points.  The fun part is when your opponent destroys Dominance or it gets destroyed at the opponent's end phase by Fusion Destiny's effect. If your opponent destroys it before Dystopia dies then you want to summon Dreadmaster, Disk commander, and 1 other Destiny HERO (Normally Malicious if you used Dynatag/Drawhand's effects and banished them already) activating Disk Commander's effect to draw 2. If your opponent does not destroy Dominance or Dystopia dies first, then you want to summon Dystopia instead of the other Destiny HERO and use it's effect to burn your opponent again.  When you summon Dreadmaster (or Dystopia) off of Dominance's floating effect on their turn while D - Tactics is on your field you can banish a card from either their hand (random), field, or graveyard. The cool thing about Dreadmaster is that the turn he is summoned, Destiny HEROs cannot be destroyed by battle or card effect AND you don't take battle damage from them, protecting your cards to set up for the next turn, guaranteeing you at least 3 monsters if your opponent has no other ways to get rid of them. What you can do from then on is summon <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Cross Crusader"">Xtra HERO Cross Crusader</a> using Disk Commander and Malicious/Dreadmaster/another hero in your hand as material to bring back Dystopia/Dominance from the graveyard, banishing ANOTHER opponent's card with D - Tactics. If you summon Dystopia again you could burn your opponent again up to 4800 damage over the two of your turns.  The extra deck isn't super strict. 2 Dominance and Dystopia just in case. <a data-name=""Masked HERO Anki"">Masked HERO Anki</a> and <a data-name=""Vision HERO Trinity"">Vision HERO Trinity</a> as OTK tech cards. 2 Dark law standard. <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dangerous"">Destiny HERO - Dangerous</a> is there as a polymerization play as an extender or a third Fusion Destiny target if you run out of Destiny HEROs in the deck haha (this is actually a serious problem stop laughing). <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Dread Decimator"">Xtra HERO Dread Decimator</a> and <a data-name=""Xtra HERO Wonder Driver"">Xtra HERO Wonder Driver </a>are standard. 2 Cross Crusader pretty standard. <a data-name=""Cross-Sheep"">Cross-Sheep</a> is not necessary at all, just had extra space and its a nice card with <a data-name=""Elemental HERO Stratos"">Elemental HERO Stratos</a> and Shadow Mist, activating their effects from the grave. Anaconda is really the only necessary expensive card in the deck. You need one copy in order to do the combo. I guess you could do without it and just use the Scorpio and Cobra for Cross-Sheep or material for Plasma (or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Dogma"">Destiny HERO - Dogma</a> if you are feeling extra spicy).  The side deck is just additional draw power/<a data-name=""Destiny End Dragoon"">Destiny End Dragoon</a> in case you want to use him instead of one of the other 2 monsters going second.  Overall this is a nice approach to the normally cookie cutter HERO standard strategy that everyone uses (myself included...). It is relatively budget; with the exception of the Vision HERO engine and Anaconda it is less than 50 dollars. Deck is about 135 dollars. Vision HEROS + Anaconda is about 91 dollars. 135 - 91 = 43 dollars. Pretty cheap huh? I was thinking about making a bigger deck since the deck runs out of resources but it hurts the chance of finding D - Tactics.  Thank you for checking out my deck profile.

I’m sticking with my pendulum magician destruction sword deck so strategy is very similar with various end results but we all know getting Dragoon on the field is a must, getting an addition negate with vortex is a must; and locking monster effects and the extra deck with Buster Dragon, Dragon Destroyer and Dragon Buster is a must. I know that seems like a lot but it can be done in one turn consistently with guardragon, skull dread and protector welp and made more likely with Hali. my friend runs a six Sam deck that burns in one turn so I’ve been consistently improving to lock him in one turn."

Only 2 <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping"">Plunder Patroll Shipshape Ships Shipping</a> and <a data-name=""Plunder Patroll Booty"">Plunder Patroll Booty</a>: I decided to cut these 2 down because I ended up bricking a lot with them. I would only max out shipshape if I could play Magicians souls but sadly I only have 1 and I don't want to buy more :D  3x <a data-name=""Salvage"">Salvage</a>: I saw a lot of people playing 2 but I think this card is really important for the deck and I want to see it as much as possible because I always want to have plunder cards in my hand before I end my turn.  no desires, 1 <a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>: I would play desires but I wanted to keep this deck at 40 cards and I feel like all the other cards are very important for my strategy and I think 1 avarice can really help you out if you top deck it. I will probably put it back in my next list but I decided to to this one without desires.  Extra Deck Plunders: I saw a lot of people running 3 of every Plunder Patroll card in their extra deck. I get that you always need them to summon out your monsters on your opponents turn but I don't think you need to max out all of them. In fact I used to run only 1 of each but I decided to play 2 Moerk and Lys because they are the most important Extra deck plunders in my opinion. They both have really good effects and Moerk is also dark which is a pretty popular attribute. The reason why I don't want to play too many plunders in my extra deck because of 2 reasons: 1. The main combo of my strategy takes too much extra deck space and 2. there are plenty of options to recycle your ED monsters from the grave either with Booty, Avarice or <a data-name=""Daigusto Emeral"">Daigusto Emeral</a>  &nbsp;  <strong>Strategy/Main Combo</strong>:  The Strategy of this deck focuses around 1 Main combo with <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>: Ideally you have a <a data-name=""whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm"">whitebeard, the Plunder Patroll Helm</a> and another monster to make Halqifibrax. use Halq effect to summon <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast o-lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast o-lion</a> from your deck. Link halqifibrax into <a data-name=""Linkross"">Linkross</a> and summon 2 Tokens. Use 1 token and o-lion to synchro summon <a data-name=""Martial Metal Marcher"">Martial Metal Marcher</a>. Chain link 1 Material Metal, Chain link 2 o-lion. Then you can synchro summon <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc light"">Herald of the Arc light</a> with Marcher and the lvl 1 token. be careful before you summon Herald because any monster you will send from hand or deck to the GY will be banished instead after he is on the field. Then you can synchro summon <a data-name=""Cyberse Quantum Dragon"">Cyberse Quantum Dragon</a> with the lvl 3 token from o-lion and whitebeard. Now you can trigger Whitebeards effect to summon out another plunder patroll from your deck. After that you will be locked into plunder patrolls but you can still summon <a data-name=""Blackbeard, the Plunder Patroll Captain"">Blackbeard, the Plunder Patroll Captain </a>using that plunder patroll monster and linkross as link material.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss can use it's effect of negating your opponent's face up card once per turn. Using Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane's effect of tributing 1 monster to special summon 1 ""Red Dragon Archfiend"" monster from the GY is a must-do if you want many synchro monsters on the field.

General plays:  Photon Vanisher + another level 4 monster -&gt; Starleige Photon Blast. you want to use vanishers effect to special summon it and draw a Galaxy-eyes photon dragon, then summon Photon blast to special summon photon dragon. Photon blast also serves as protection for your other monsters and can special summon galaxy-eyes photon dragon from your gy or banished zone, and if you can attach Photon Orbital, Photon blast will protect itself.  Situations:  Opening play on an empty board.  Starleige Photon Blast Dragon: will protect your other monsters from card effects and can special summon galaxy eyes photon dragon.  Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord: will be able to negate a monster effect, and serves as a draw engine.  Galaxy-eyes solflare: you can use photon lord to add galaxy-eyes photon dragon and have fuel for solflare to pop a special summon, disrupting your opponent. (look for key targets like tuners, link monsters ect)  Opening turn and the opponent has played  Galaxy-eyes full armor photon dragon will be able to destroy any face up card by using its effect, also the 4000 attack is good enough to deal with most monsters.  Galaxy-Eyes cipher blade dragon will deal with pesky face downs that you don't want to trigger.  Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon dragon, if you just need to negate all monster effects on board. pretty useful and can OTK with a combo that we will get to later.  Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, basically if you need to just negate all effects on the board and you need something that's beefy, 4500 attack base and will indefinitely negate all effects on the board. if you get the option or are just able to, try summoning him first then your other monsters as to keep those effects.  Big damage Combos  Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon (has Galaxy-Eyes photon dragon and Galaxy-eyes afterglow as matierial) + other Xyz monsters. if you have this card and another Xyz monster, and you know its safe to attack, attack with number 62, activate its effect and remove afterglow as material, number 62 will gain attack equal to all the added up ranks of Xyz monsters on your field x200 (if you have 2 lvl 8 Xyz that will equal 8+8=16 x 200 = 3200) and then activate Afterglows effect, and since its activated during the damage step all number monsters have their attack doubled (in the case previously 4000+3200 = 7200 x 2 = 14400.)  Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon + Galaxy-Eyes Afterglow Dragon. This is pretty simple, at the start of your damage step, if you know its safe to attack, activate number 107's effect by removing afterglow as its material, you negate all monster effects on board and since its afterglow and you did this during the damage step number 107's attack will be 6000 and it will be able to attack twice."

(Most likely chip damage). Also you depend on your field spell a lot but hopefully you go into time before your opponent can side s/t hate.  Non Ghostricks in the Main Deck:  Mystic Mine: You play 4 copies of metaverse. It can be a free win going first and can stall so you can get resources. It's just nice to have.  Needle Ceiling: It Blows up your opponents board but not yours since it only effect face up monsters  Drowning Mirror Force: Your opponent is going to attack directly most of the time due to the your field spells or you bricked which resulted in a t set pass. Either way it's a good way to remove stuff but it is vulnerable to s/t hate.  For the extra deck Break Sword is there because good rank 3. The links are generic. They're nice to have but if you want to run extrav then I recommend swaping 2 of them for another alucard and a socuteboss.  Other options (All of these can replace Needle Ceiling or Drowning if you want):  The Rock: It's needle ceiling but a handtrap. It only tributes face up monsters meaning most likely your not deleting your stuff.  Battle Fader: It's a better lantern but not searchable and not recoverable.  Pot of Extrav: It's a plus one. If you want to use it then I recommend taking out a skeleton and jiangshi or 2.  Titanocider/Lost Wind: Negates stuff and makes your opponent suffer more. What's not to like?

Initially only 8 Salamangreat monsters were being ran in the main deck (no Fowl), however I found that Salad's lose if they don't see Salamangreat monsters, so an extra extender in the form of Salamangreat Fowl was added. Now the deck has 13 Starter Cards, 14 Extenders (including the field spell) and 13 Handtraps+Traps+Interruptions. This is quite even, allowing for nicer ratios when drawing.  For the extra deck you can side out the Avramax or one of the XYZ monsters for the second Heatleo if you find that you need him. There is a Salamangreat Almiraj as a slightly more generic link 1 that can be used for when Zombie world is up. You can play Traptrix Rafflesia and Gravesdigger's Trap Hole if you want instead of Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow to play around Nibiru.

This deck also plays an array of hand traps allowing it to easily play second. To do the combo is you need to have 3 level 4 monsters on the field which is easy, then you overlay 2 for Force Strix and detach a material to search singing Lanius, then you special singing Lanius from your hand then link Force Strix and Singing Lanius to summon Wise Strix, then you special Summon Zephros the elite from your deck then overlay it and the last level 4 for Force Strix, then activate its effects detaching Zephros to search Raiders' Wing, then Wise Strix sets Soul Shave Force from your Deck, then detach 1 material to special Raiders' Wing from your hand, then you activate soul shave special summoning force Strix from your GY to use it as material to summon Beatrice, then you activate Beatrice sending Orcust Knightmare to the GY, then you banish Knightmare to dump World Wand, wand banish to summon Knightmare, link Knightmare and Beatrice to summon Galatea, galatea shuffle wand to set Babel, activate babel then bounce it to summon Zephros then activate babel again, overlay zephros and Raiders' wing to summon evilswarm nightmare, then overlay galatea int Dingirsu, Link for I:P then end you turn.

Really in love with this archetype for not only the beautiful card art, but their versatility as well. Black Rose Dragon also being one of the most iconic of the Signer Dragons.  &nbsp;  Not many long winded combos, but most of the better plays are as follows:  White Rose Cloister to special summon a rose dragon or one of your plant type monsters. If you summon a tuner: you can bring out Dark Rose Fairy as well.  Rose Girl can special summon herself if you have her in hand when using Lonefire Blossom's effect, or when using any of your plant type monsters to perform a Synchro or Link summon.  In addition, White Rose Dragon can special summon itself from hand by having any dragon or plant type tuner on the field.  Twilight Rose Knight's effect of special summoning a level 4 or below plant type monster from hand enables the classic level 7 combo for Black Rose Dragon, or level 6 for Splendid Rose/Queen of Thorns.  More to come on this since it's my first deck I'm posting, but the side deck is there mostly to play around with. Hope this is useful to someone :)"

I've edited the deck so that it uses Yuki-Musume and Yuki-Onna 4, and I made space by trimming Gozuki and some Link plays I didn't really find too useful. I also extended the second round of the Mayakashi ladder, so that it has better reach against abnormal deck counts, as well as giving it more fuel in case it has to fight conventionally. This comes at the cost of some toolbox space, but this deck is pretty committed to its game plan anyway.  Play lines all revolve around finding a way to get Dakki, 2 Level 1 material, and Bone Tower onto the field. Common lines almost always involve Hajun somehow, since he's a one-card trigger for the ladder.

The key is to always be aware of the attributes of the opponent and have fun practicing it.  Kaiju, the kaiju engine is to take care of hard targets and throw new attributes onto your opponents field for you to summon new Plunder Patrol monsters. <p class=""engine-dark-box"">Immortal Phoenix Gearfried, this card is very good in this deck. By banishing emblem or a monster that is equipped to another monster you can Special summon it and get an extra negation after the battle phase.</p> Utopia combo, if you have 2 L4 monsters (which happens a lot) you can create a 10,000 attack monster. You start by overlaying them to summon Utopia Double then activate its affect and get Double or Nothing and summon Number 39 Utopia. since it was summoned by utopia double it is at 5,000 attack then proceed to the battle phase attack then activate N39's affect and negate the affect then activate Double or Nothing and it attacks with 10,000 attack. The only downside to this combo is that you are not allowed to attack directly so never use it if the opponent does not have a monster."

If you get this far and farther to Martial Metal Marcher, you are most likely to succeed in achieving the board. This board I speak of consists of Apollousa, Borreload Savage Dragon (equipped with Dragon Buster Destruction Sword and Crystron Halqifibrax which means it gets 2 borrel counters which you can use to negate cards and effects), and Herald of Arc Light or Adamancipator Risen Dragite if you manage to make it that far (it is possible to achieve summoning both level 8 monsters in the first turn.

","Red Resonator is a really important card in this deck, normal summon Red Resonator to special summon a level 4 fiend monster from your hand. (Such as Red Sprinter, Red Familiar, Performage Hat Tricker, etc.) You will then be able to synchro summon Red Rising Dragon from your Extra Deck. By using Red Rising Dragon's effect you'll be able to special summon Red Resonator from the GY and use Red Resonator's special effect of targeting a monster on the field to gain LP equal to the monster's ATK.  You can then synchro summon for Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend.  Keep repeating this process and you'll have multiple synchro monsters on the field. Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss is a good card to synchro summon for, use something like Synkron Resonator or Chain Resonator to synchro summon it with Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend. Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss can use it's effect of negating your opponent's face up card once per turn. Using Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Bane's effect of tributing 1 monster to special summon 1 ""Red Dragon Archfiend"" monster from the GY is a must-do if you want many synchro monsters on the field. Counter field sweeps with Hot Red Dragon Abyss's effect.  Pretty fun deck, not too competitive."

A cool combo I came up with that I think is really good is with the Fire True King, you can use his effect to pop 2 fire monsters in your hand to special summon himself and banish an opponent's monster which is pretty sick. Sending Infernoids as cost from your hand to grave via Agnimazud isn't really a cost because you don't go neg since Infernoids can be special summoned from your graveyard anyway. </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Imagination"">Infernoid Imagination</a><a data-name=""Reasoning""> is also an insane going second card, allowing you to send basically all of your Infernoid monsters from deck to grave to special summon </a><a data-name=""Infernoid Tierra"">Infernoid Tierra</a><a data-name=""Reasoning""> and send all 3 copies of </a><a data-name=""Reasoning"">Elder Entity N</a>'tss and using their effects to pop 3 cards on the field. You can also pop <a data-name=""Nine-Tailed Fox"">Nine-Tailed Fox</a> using Agnimazud and it will generate 2 tokens. I know its not that consistent because its a two card combo that isn't searchable by any means, but its a cool tech I liked when testing. I've surprisingly beaten a lot of meta decks in testing with this deck. You just have to go second and bait out their negates with your lesser powerful interruption cards and then blow them out with <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> or Infernoid Imagination. I hope you guys enjoy and see you next time!"

Your other objective is to get Unicore on field. You can get the Phul on board quite easily since you are running a ton of searchers. I can't stress it enough that getting Phul on the board is your #1 objective. Unicore is just the icing on the cake. But if you open a way to get Unicore + Kaleidoscope + Either Ophiel, Phul or one of the big Megaliths you can use Kaleidoscope to make Unicore, sending Herald of the Arclight, then using Herald Of the Arclight's effect to grab the missing combo piece. After turn one, you pretty much just keep setting up Phul to make Bethor, not allowing your opponent to get a hold on the game and slowly poke away at their lifepoints.  PROS <ul>  	<li>It's Consistent. Like I said, you are running so many searchers that there are almost always multiple ways to get the cards you need.</li>  	<li>A well placed summon of Bethor can just completely shut down a lot of decks.</li>  	<li>It's extremely cheap. All of the Megalith cards are 15 cents or less, and the most expensive cards are Arclight ($3) and Chalislime ($3) and Manju ($4)</li> </ul> CONS <ul>  	<li>It is extremely fragile at the Phul resolution on your opponent's turn. It is easily stopped by an Imperm or ash, and at that point you just have a blue boy on field, and maybe a Unicore.</li>  	<li>Nuking your opponent's board is cool, but there is a reason why Raigeki is not played in every deck today. Most meta decks can play through this, a lot like how they can play through Nibiru.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"

A loopable destruction protection for jowgen.,"I found that most people would be countering the one card winda by siding Cyber Dragon Nova and Mechaba, when I realize that Jowgen the spiritualist just says no to all special summons, and that is the point of this deck. With the added protection from Spellbook of Fate and the new Dragma Punishment, it makes jowgen control more better and consistent. All the small dragma monsters are lv4 light spellcaster which is perfect for target for Downbeat to special jowgen straight from the deck!  The spellbook portion is only to engine your card advantage and fuel fate. Deck space is tight so we run only 2 Spellbook Magician of Prophecy as this card is searchable easily by Spellbook of Secrets. Spellbook of Life is an additional extender and can be use to link climb as you can don't have to banish a monster that has a level, but the usual target is either jowgen or magicians' souls. Grand Spellbook Tower was way more useful than I thought as it would help you in the grind game AND if your opponent is going second, 8/10 times, they want to lightning storm your backrow as say you have dragma punishment facedown to protect your cards and forgetting the tower has a graveyard effect to special summon a monster from your deck.  The Dragma portion allows the setup for protection and not usually to use up your normal summon. Adin is convenient that has 1000 atk to link into Almiraj which would back your other Dragma special summons live. Ecclesia in most decks searches Fleur but in this instance we want to to search Dragma punishment to set as a backrow. Fleur is of course a target for magicians' souls and a monster negate when needed. Now the second main reason why this deck came was Dragma Punishment. Dragma punish can send an extra monster to pop a monster on the field with atk less then or equal to the monster sent. There is 3 cards usually you want to send with this: <ol>  	<li>Ashen Dragon, for the end search of Fleur or special ecclesia for another search if you haven't</li>  	<li>N'tss, pop another card on the field</li>  	<li>Omega, to put back dragma punishment into the deck to be searched again</li> </ol> The only other card I see worthy talking about is Dark ruler No More, it gives the deck a go second option to combat those n-negate boards."

Also BLS, Chaos Ruler, and the Draitrons can return fro","Draitron is Impcantation on crack and super compatible with Black Luster Soldier, being lv1 light it means you can have Overtex for Pill using Super Soldier Synthesis to fetch it from deck. Combo depends on what you draw, it means you need practice on how to maximize the Draitron advantage (key point is Synthesis can summon BLS from GY like Draitron ritual and Synthesis needs lv1 light fodder in hand). So, the deck has to be carefully tweaked for its ratio and after countless of testing, I found this ratio are the best (subjective, means you can still tweak it to find the objectively best ratio/combination). Tutorial: <a>https://bit.ly/30sLjuO</a>  Diviner is combo piece searchable from Benten. Cupid Volley is there as it is a lv1 light for Synthesis and another light fairy target for Benten while can mill Draitron/BLS/Overtex/Meteornis. Effect Veiler is lv1 light for Synthesis and can be fetched from Chaos Ruler for extra interruption. Meteornis Draitron can be recurred from GY, summon ritual from GY. Gateway to Chaos for BLS and super easy to have counter for ritual spell searching. Fafnir mostly as extra Nova for Draitron, can search Meteornis too.  Extra deck: N'tss and Arc Light as Diviner target. Michael as lv7 (Diviner + 1 Draitron) removal and mills card like Cupid Volley. Reprodocus as fodder if we draw Tyranno.

I'm expecting a Linkross ban, but with Coronavirus this might be legal for longer. I initially built this combo (or at least the shell of it) for HEROES, on the basis of using Cross-Sheep to res Stratos to search Faris after finding fodder with Isolde. The problem with the combo in that shell was threefold - the deck had no follow-ups, couldn't play through hand traps, and had too many bricks and not enough space. Eldlich seems like a much better fit for the combo, since it solves those problems - it even ends on additional monsters, since I didn't feel as bad about running the Seyfert/Black Dragon/White Dragon engine over REDM. That means either more negates for Apollousa, or a lingering effect in the form of Abyss Dweller. There are some problems - you can mill bricks with Tuning and kill your own combo, for example. And it does still take 8 bricks to do the combo, meaning nearly a 1/4 of the deck are bricks (though soft ones you don't mind in your hand). Also, Dragoon summoned this way can't break boards, significantly reducing its utility. Still, you get 2-4 negates, plus a potential lingering effect from Abyss Dweller, and an Omni-negate on a great beatstick before you start dropping backrow, and if you get interrupted you should still be able to get some Eldlich stuff going most of the time."

""Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince"" allows us to send ""Atlantean Dragoons"", to search for ""Atlantean Dragoons"", thus allowing us to get 2 searches for the price of one, or sending ""Atlantean Heavy Infantry"" to destroy an opponent's card (Infantry targets so be careful what you try to upset).  ""Moulinglacia, the Elemental Lord"" is the key to destroying your opponent's hand before they even have a chance to play, Special Summon him when you have 5 WATER monsters in the Graveyard to remove 2 cards from their hand.  ""Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys"" when Synchro Summoned allows us to draw a card to extend with, and also allows us to XYZ Summon ""True King of all Calamities"", or destroy a card on the field while sending cards such as: &#x2666; ""Mermail Abyssgunde"" to <em>Monster Reborn</em> a ""Mermail"" monster from the Graveyard; &#x2666; or any ""Atlantean"" to combo farther.  ""Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"" is our 4th hand destruction card, and allowing us to Banish other cards from the Hand, Graveyard and Field (1 each).  ""Bujinki Ahashima"" allows us to setup the ""Bahamut Shark"" ""Toadally Awesome"" giving us another out to ""Nibiru, the Primal Being"", or to Negate a card in general.

In almost 16 years but I decided to try updating my October 2004 deck for fun.  This deck includes a lot of old cards from my October 2004 deck as well as some newer cards I think sound interesting.  Before I quit in October 2004, I had plans to put the Horus LV cards in my deck if I decided to keep playing so I put them in this deck.  The deck relies on the Horus cards as a major strategy but it also relies on Waking the Dragon to get powerful monsters out of the extra deck easily.  Of course, Injection Fairy Lily is also a major factor in the deck as she was in my 2004 deck and I’ve included two copies in the main deck and one in the side deck (she was limited in 2004).  I’ve also included Lullaby of Obedience in the side deck to maybe use in the second duel of the match in order to disrupt the opponent’s strategy."
