If you don't know the drill, the main objective is to summon Crystron Halfquifibrax and a White Stone of Legend as soon as possible in order to have material to summon Guardragon Elpy and Guardragon Pisty to each of Halq's arrows, Special Summon Starliege Seyfert and use it to get Nebula Dragon or other level 8 dragon.  Then, you Link Summon Saryuja Skull Dread in order to dig through your deck and get the combo pieces to get your final board, which must have at least: Hieratic Seal of Heavenly Spheres (1 interruption), Number 38 (1 Spell Negate) and Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon (Pendulum Prevention, if relevant, an 1 GY Negate).  Since this is an early format for Dragon link, you can sometimes get away with some shenanigans, like summoning Photon Lord with Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon as material, in order to negate AND destroy whatever monster you negate. In real TCG you should remove that gimmicky stuff and change them with 3 Chaos Space, substitute CED with Chaos Ruler, the Dragon of Armaggeddon, add 1 or two Noctovision Dragon, remove Infinite Impermanence and add a couple more hand traps.  Again, keep in mind that this deck is only meant to be played in this game, the format, card pool, banlist and playing mindset is very different from that of TCG, even compared to the format closest to this game (March 2020 pre-ETCO)."

I freaking love Generaiders. Are they strong? Well, Harr is  surely not bad and technically they do have access to a very fun dragon who's name I won't say but getting it out during turn one requires either 2 specific cards or a wacky one card Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight combo that flees in fear at the sight of pretty much any handtrap. I guess that makes them decent, they have access to a lot of powerful draw spells if playing pure but very limited access to strong boss monsters.  So what <span>are they good at? <span>Communism</span>. That's right, com</span>munism. Generaiders turn their turn into OUR turn. Doing barely anything on your own turn you're playing in their Draw Phase longer than it takes a Sky Striker player to shuffle their deck. WHY IN THE WORLD ARE YOU MAKING TEN PILES, THERE'RE ONLY FIVE MINUTES ON THE CLOCK!! If you haven't noticed yet, I like to use these deck descriptions to proccess my yugioh trauma.  So as I was saying I was going through some Generaider decklists and found BorgarTimeYGO's latest list. And what I saw was eye opening. It was my epiphany toilet on the roof moment. What I saw was obvious and clear as day, yet completely new in every way. I saw a Red-Eyes Fusion.  You don't summon during your turn with the exception of Loptr but even without him you have 10 cards to access Generaider Boss Stage. So I thought if Gravekeepers and Subterrors can do it, why can't I? Or rather, why can't <em>we</em>?  I hereby present to you: The Boss Monster Archetype mixed together with what is probably the strongest boss monster ever printed, Generaider Dragoon.  To be fair I have not tested this deck much (as in I just made the decklist and wrote this article while at work in between calls) and some of the cards may be opted out for different ones but <em>that's</em> what a community is for *roll any sitcom outro*  And don't mind the two extra Jormungandr in the ED and the Loptr in Side. They represent the three Knightmares/Droll &amp; Lock Birds but the <em>lovely</em> new feature that automatically assigns the archetype descriptions apparently considers my deck to be too Knightmare and Machine centric so I'm trying to outsmart the system. Just in case the feature takes words into consideratiom: Generaider, Generaider, GeNeRaIdEr, GENERAIDER!!! (also Red-Eyes)"

I myself have never been a fan of meta decks, but Dino has caught my interest the past few weeks. This deck has all the things I want in a deck, handtraps, boardwipe, draw power, negates, and anti-negates, seeing all of it in one deck definitely made me make a version of my own. The deckbuilding process didn't take much as the deck itself runs a pretty standard ratio, the only thing that you'll tweak are the handtraps, extra deck ratios, and sides. The gameplay is pretty simple since you have a lot of cards that will protect you against disruption, you don't need to think much of any other routes unless your hand is complicated and at the same time, you have cards that will not let your opponent play.  <strong><span>2 Card Combo Going 1st (Miscellaneousaurus + Babycerasaurus) </span></strong><span><span>Note: You can search the missing piece/s by using Fossil Dig.</span></span> <ol>  	<li>Use <span>Miscellaneousaurus' effect, sending it to the GY to provide protection for dinosaur monsters against activated effect (Ash, Gamma, Nibiru, etc.)</span></li>  	<li>Use <span>Miscellaneousaurus' second effect banishing it to special summon Animadorned Archosaur.</span></li>  	<li>Activate Animadorned Archosaur's effect,destroying <span>Babycerasaurus to add Double Evolution Pill.</span></li>  	<li><span>Babycerasaurus effect will trigger since it's destroyed by a card effect, use it to special summon Oviraptor.</span></li>  	<li>Activate Oviraptor's effect to add another copy of <span>Babycerasaurus, normal summon it.</span></li>  	<li>Activate Oviraptor's second effect to destroy <span>Babycerasaurus to special summon the other Babycerasaurus in the GY.

But when it works, be it a quick Montage Dragon OTK attempt, focusing on the banishing plays through the Chaos Dragon engine, or just playing the Malefics to try and thin the deck, whatever floats your boat. Maybe one of these days, I'll update it to fit with the modern era. ^^;"

Her quick effect to link off into any of the other Sky Striker links helps her to dodge many hand traps such as Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence. In addition to her quick effect to link, she also has a constant reviving effect that allows for her to come back every time a Sky Striker link monster is destroyed, which makes her a very persistent and hard to out card.  Sky Striker Link Monsters: Kagari, Hayate, &amp; Shizuki all work hand in hand, helping you to obtain cards and advantage. Hayate is a foolish burial that helps to set up for Kagari which adds cards from the graveyard to hand. This basic combo helps to bring out certainly needed spells in the deck such as Widow Anchor or Multirole. Shizuku is a searcher for every spell that isn't in the GY, so it is important to know what spells to add back from the GY using Kagari, rather than just choosing a card that may only be situational. Finally, Kaina and Zeke, are the outliers that are only played as one-ofs. Kaina helps to stop any large attacking monsters and Zeke is a Link-2 which helps to remove any monster in your main monster zones.  Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor - The strongest spell in the whole Sky Striker Spell arsenal. Not only does this card negate effects, but can also steal the opponent's monsters. This card is played as a 3 of because it is never bad to open at least 1 and helps to protect your Sky Striker cards from any potential negates from opponent's monsters.  Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer: One of the strongest monsters in terms of both attack power and keeping your opponent in check, not only popping problematic cards but also reviving itself every turn.  Crystron, Selene, Accesscode: This simple combo is an easy game-ender, which allows for you to easily wipe out your opponent's board and attack over any large monsters your Destroy Phoenix Enforcer or Sky Strikers can not beat. Keep in mind, Accesscode is like a glass cannon, and this whole combo can be stopped by any monster or summon negation."

I opted for a going first control based strat, using the Magikey negation trap and Dogmatika Punishment as centerpices of this. The main idea is to get a usable board, and then set the backrow. I also included a strong floodgate as to make sure the opponent can't do much of anything. If anyone has any ideas as to what another engine would work aside from Dogmatika, it'd be appreciated. I plan on building this IRL but I can't afford Dogmatika, so I need a different engine. I feel like Magikeys have a lot of potential and can really pop off, given the right support."

Much thanks!  The idea of the deck is to get out <a data-name=""Lilith, Lady of Lament"">Lilith, Lady of Lament</a> and <a data-name=""Malice, Lady of Lament"">Malice, Lady of Lament</a> as quickly as possible, then use them and <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> to tribute the opponent's monsters (as well as your tokens) during their turn for the ability to freely set and recycle trap cards. You're free to swap out any traps you'd like, so long as you have Normal Traps in their place. I picked cards that allow you to recycle <a data-name=""Lair of Darkness"">Lair of Darkness</a> and use it infinitely. That is, if Lair gets banished, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Leanchoilia"">Paleozoic Leanchoilia</a> will return it to the GY, where <a data-name=""Jar of Avarice"">Jar of Avarice</a> can recycle it. Also, <a data-name=""Dark Spirit Art - Greed"">Dark Spirit Art - Greed</a> can be used to speed the deck up as much as necessary, providing an additional two cards per turn.  Aside from this, you can also use <a data-name=""Chaos Hunter"">Chaos Hunter and </a><a data-name=""Chaos Hunter"">Barrier Statue of the Abyss</a> to prevent your opponent's actions. Both can be summoned with <a data-name=""Super Team Buddy Force Unite"">Super Team Buddy Force Unite</a> for a surprise effect, and both can be added to your hand with <a data-name=""Sales Pitch"">Sales Pitch</a>. (Their effects can be used because they are not *activated*. That is, continuous effects get a free pass with <a data-name=""Sales Pitch"">Sales Pitch</a>."

""A.I.dle Reborn"" can special summon an ""@ignister"" monster from the GY; if you don't control ""Pikari"" and have ""Backup Secretary"" ""Cyberse Converter"" or ""Catch Eve L2"" in your hand you can special summon one.  And with that you have all the materials needed to link summon ""The Arrival Cyberse @ignister"" and more than likely have some support cards (""Wind Pegasus,"" ""Gussari,"" and/or ""RA.I.te of Battle"" to ensure that you get a chance to use it."

Magikey also known as enchanted key is a new archetype revolving around a vanilla. The fusion/ritual spell even gains an advantage if you control a vanilla and the fusion monsters list a vanilla as one of the requirements. Does that sound familiar? Yes it does! Metalfoes is basically the same thing! </span>  <span>~Perfect~Synergy~</span>  <span>Both archetypes have normal monsters required on the field to use good effects to fusion summon. Both archetypes use level 4 monsters and in my eyes they have ~perfecto~sinergia~</span>  <span>Yes I’m aware I said that twice. (I love saying that idk why) </span>  <span>The Magikey archetype is not meta relevant or anything, it is rouge at best and can put up promising boards (I have combos for them in my video) consisting of a berserker (banish a monster), the level 4 ritual (monster negate during battle phase) and a counter trap (negates a backrow and has a DNA surgery like effect that kills decks relient on attributes) with only 2.5 cards and can also do this WITHOUT even touching the metalfoes part of the deck. The deck can do so much more (metalfoes can put up 4+ interruptions on it’s own). The field spell of this new archetype is REALLY good and it can search any monster AND it can search the fusion/ritual spell which is a brilliant fusion for the deck. I think it definitely has potential, but we will have to wait and see for future support coming out for this deck. If you want to have some fun and have a break from the meta, I recommend trying this deck out - But if you want to win, Just play Dragon link. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>YouTube video link (has combos as well) - <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gO7nfLGqEJ8</a></span>  &nbsp;  <span>Thanks, and I’ll see you on the next one! :D</span>"

Sick of your deck being able to play through handtraps? Don't worry, I got you covered.  I've been trying to get my friends into the game, and they both like Blue-Eyes from the anime. So I got to cracking on making a decent Blue-Eyes. Initially, I said screw it. I threw in a bunch of broken traps and a bunch of Blue-Eyes cards. We're talkin' Dogmatika Punishment without any other Dogmatika cards. It was bad. Then I thought ""Huh, this deck doesn't need a normal summon."" so my monkey brain instantly went to the Invoked package. Then I realized, Mechaba is a <strong>Level 9</strong>. Then I thought, ""Huh, can't Blue-Eyes occasionally make <strong>Level 9</strong> Synchros?"". Like any war criminal, I saw the capacity of making 2 Level 9s to go into the <strong>Very Fun Dragon</strong> and tirelessly worked in a feverish haze to create the dumbest combo deck. Without any recollection of what happening during the building and testing, I woke up from a horrible nightmare and saw the monstrosity I created, <strong>Invoked Blue-Eyes VFD Turbo</strong>. Now you may be asking, ""Wouldn't just making it janky Dragon Link with a Rokket Engine be way better and more consistent than an Invoked Engine?"" The answer to that is yes, absolutely.  Basically this deck creates VFD. That's it. Using the Invoked Engine you get out Mechaba, which can kinda protect you from handtraps and gets your first level 9. Then you get out the other level 9 through absolutely ridiculous and obtuse combos to get out a vanilla Blue-Eyes or Alternative and a level 1 Tuner. Your ability to play through established boards is very limited, and so is your ability to prevent them from establishing those boards. Our handtrap of choice is <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Skull Meister &lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Skull Meister </strong></a>simply because can pitch it off <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Chaos Space &lt;/strong&gt;""><strong></strong></a><a data-name=""Chaos Space"">Chaos Space</a> for the White Dragon. When it comes to synergy, we need to take what we can get. My side deck is just really broken cards that might help you break boards, I did not spent more than a minute making it.  Normal Combos are like Dragon Link, but way more fragile and inconsistent. <strong>Chaos Space</strong> pitches the useless cards out of our hands and can search our <strong>White &amp; Black Dragons</strong>, which need no explanation. Obviously we want our <strong>White Stones</strong> in the Grave with <strong><a data-name=""Dragon Shrine"">Dragon Shrine</a></strong>, but <strong>Foolish Burial</strong> also lets us get our <strong><a data-name=""Master With Eyes of Blue"">Master With Eyes of Blue</a></strong> in the Grave. If you're unfamiliar, he shuffles himself from the Grave, sends a monster you control to the GY, and gets a <strong>Vanilla Blue-Eyes</strong> or a properly summoned <strong>Alternative</strong> out of your Grave. This is really useful later in the combo when you need to manage your Link Arrows with the Guardragons, or when we can summon him off <strong>Halqifibrax</strong> to make a 9 Synchro. Another monster you probably won't be familiar with is <strong><a data-name=""Sage With Eyes of Blue"">Sage With Eyes of Blue</a></strong>, he pitches himself from the hand, sends a monster you control to the Grave, and grabs a <strong>Vanilla Blue-Eyes</strong> from the Deck. It's because of this card we don't want to abuse our <a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;White Stone of Legend&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>White Stone of Legend</strong></a> to move all our bricks to our hand, which is a mandatory effect. In the case we don't want our bricks in hand, we use the <strong>White Stone of Ancients</strong>, which also allows us to add any <strong>Alternatives</strong> in our Graveyard to our hand. Anyways, back to <strong>Sage</strong>, opening him with <strong>Aleister</strong> is especially good, because we can use his effect to send the <strong>Secure Gardna</strong> we were about to banish anyways, and similarly he's useful later in the combo if you want to do some jank plays re-arranging the arrows.  As for our ridiculous Extra Deck options, we're running <strong><a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a></strong>, a legitimately terrible card that happens to fit a specific niche; a downward pointing arrow that we can make with <strong>Almiraj</strong> and any other card in the deck that we can make under a Dragon Lock. See, a lot of combos start with an <strong>Almiraj</strong> we made from <strong>Aleister</strong>, pointing down and to the right. Now let's say we have a <strong>Chaos Dragon</strong> combo going, let's say for example we use the <strong>Black Dragon</strong> to make an <strong>Elpy</strong>, then use the <strong>White Dragon</strong> we added with the <strong>Almiraj</strong> to make <strong>Crossrose</strong>, making our <strong>Elpy</strong> live and getting one of our <strong>White Stones</strong> out of the deck. From here we can go into whatever preferred Rank 2 for the situation, either <strong>Halq</strong> or <strong>Romulus</strong>. A better deck would make <strong>Seal</strong>, but we need as many extenders as we can get. <strong>Number 38</strong> is a flex card. Demonstrated in this flex combo with a test hand I definitely didn't mulligan 3 times to get the absolute nuts on. I also definitely didn't forget to add White Dragon from Black Dragon during it, then drawing 1 with Chaos Space, I simply decided I did not need free cards. Also <strong>Artemis</strong> is to get our shitty Spellcaster Tuners off the board if we get them with Halq to convert them into a Brick-Eyes White Dragon. I do not know why <strong>Avramax </strong>is in this deck.  For other Spells, <strong>One For One </strong>is fine I guess because we run a lot of cards that are just useless in hand so we don't care what we discard off it. <strong><a data-name=""World Legacy Guardragon"">World Legacy Guardragon</a></strong> is an obviously busted card with Elpy. It can be extremely awkward, and have situations where you can't actually use it's Reborn effect cause the dumb fucking X With Eyes of Blue cards are Spellcasters and not Dragons.  <a class=""anchor-3Z-8Bb anchorUnderlineOnHover-2ESHQB"" tabindex=""0"" title=""https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=117911-26424695"" role=""button"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=117911-26424695</a>  Overall this deck is really funny and worth playing just to hear the surprise in your friend's voice when you normal summon Aleister, then start going into Guardragon plays. Called By should probably be in the main deck, however I have opted to instead decide that my opponent will not draw any hand traps when I play this deck. If you're seriously thinking about playing this, <strong>just play Dragon Link instead. It is way more fun and versatile than this pile of trash.</strong>"

It relies on abusing the link-material generation from Scapegoat, Scapeghost, and Tri-Wight to activate Law of the Normal.  <span><strong>Main Deck</strong></span>  <a data-name=""Mokey Mokey"">Mokey Mokey</a> - Nothing in the deck actually requires Mokey Mokey, so it can be replaced. But if you do this, know that you have sinned greatly. Its LIGHT attribute allows you to summon Lyna the Light Charmer.  <a data-name=""Charcoal Inpachi"">Charcoal Inpachi</a> - Replaceable by Bunilla for the EARTH element. It has the highest defense out of all level 1 normal monsters.  <a data-name=""Ankuriboh"">Ankuriboh</a> - Extra defense for your deck and is also searchable by Where Arf Thou?  <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a> - An ideal card to set on turn 1. Protects you and sets up your next turn if any tokens survive.  <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Effect Veiler</a> - Interrupts your opponent's combos and is also searchable by Where Arf Thou? You can also use it link material for Relinquished Anima or Linkuriboh in an emergency.  <a data-name=""Painful Decision"">Painful Decision</a> - Used to setup your graveyard for Tri-Wight plays. It also has the added effect of thinning out your deck of normal monsters, which tend to be weak draws. Keep in mind, if for example have 1 copy of Mokey Mokey in your hand and a Painful Choice, you should use it to search other copies of Mokey Mokey. You want to keep a future Painful Choice usable.  <a data-name=""Law of the Normal"">Law of the Normal</a> - This is one of your win conditions. The activation requirement can be easily met by having four tokens and one normal monster on the field. Keep in mind that it cannot be activated if either you or your opponent do not have a single card to discard. Your monsters are still left on the board after wiping the field.  <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a> - Your best token generator. It is best used at the end of your opponent's turn to bypass its monster summoning restriction.  <a data-name=""Where Arf Thou?"">Where Arf Thou?</a> - Searches level 1 monsters from your deck, including the important Scapeghost. You take 2000 damage if you don't normal summon the monster, but in most cases, this is a negligible penalty.  <a data-name=""Tri-Wight"">Tri-Wight</a> - Special summon 3 monsters with one card? Pretty powerful when it doesn't brick you.  The rest of the cards in the deck are additional cards to either accelerate the strategy or protect you. They can be replaced with alternatives should you see fit.  <strong><span>Extra Deck</span> </strong><strong> </strong><a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> - Three copies are needed to convert your normal monsters into effect monsters. They also provide you an additional summon if you have a normal monster in hand.  <a data-name=""Relinquished Anima"">Relinquished Anima</a> - If your opponent mispositions a monster, you can remove and steal its power with this card.  <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a> - An additional card to convert your normal monsters. If you have this card in the graveyard and Topologic Zeroboros on the board, you can use this card to help create the activation requirement of Zeroboros's field nuke.  <a data-name=""Missus Radiant"">Missus Radiant </a>- Used to start the link plays for your Scapegoat tokens.  Charmers - Additional cards with attribute coverage to start your link plays with. If the conditions are right, you can revive one of your opponents monsters.  Knightmare Cerberus and Phoenix - Provides you generic destruction effects in a pinch.  <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a> - The main boss monster of the deck and is what you generally will try to aim to activate if Law of the Normal isn't in your hand."

VRAINS and this archetype is @Ignister.  @Ignister is an archetype of cyberse monsters with various attributes who rely on swarming and beatdown strategies and this archetype is capable of ritual, fusion, synchro and XYZ summon.  Why am I discussing this archetype? Because recently @Ignister has shown it’s fangs in the OCG competition.  Anyways, let's jump to the deck list.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Monsters</div></blockquote> 3x Nibiru, The Primal Being  I think this card is the right card to be used as a hand trap in this @Ignister deck. The reason is because @Ignister really needs enough space to execute the combo perfectly, especially when the opponent has taken the link zone position on the right which makes Dark Templar @Ignister unable to use it’s full effect (special summon 3 @Ignister monster from graveyard). With the right timing this card can stop the opponent combo and force them to end their turn.  3x Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring  This card is perfect for counter every archetype on Yu-Gi-Oh! Starting from stopping add card from deck to hand, special summon from deck and send a card from deck to graveyard. Three copies are needed to increase the chances of getting this card in opening hand.  3x PSY-Framegear Gamma  If you are wondering why I choose to use PSY-Framegear archetype as my hand trap in main deck. Before I upload this deck I always test it first by dueling with competitive decks that are often used in TCG ranging from meta to rogue. Many events like when I use A.I. First Meet You and Cynet Mining in 1st turn where the enemy will negate that card using Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring, so I can negate it back using PSY-Framegear Gamma and we also got free 2 monster on board (PSY-Framegear Gamma and PSY-Frame Driver). It also gives us a chance to fight back against True King of Calamities.  1x PSY-Frame Driver  A Psychic soldier that rides into battle against the Security Forces on currents of lightning, using an autonomic amplifier called ""PSY-Frame”, and he is a normal monster.  1x Danmari @Ignister  If this card in your hand, you can special summon this card and negate opponent attack. If this card in your graveyard, you can banish this card and negate 1 face-up card effect. We're going to use the Bururu @Ignister effect and send this card to from deck to graveyard so we have 1 negate in opponent turn. One is enough.  3x Pikari @Ignister  Pikari @Ignister is a amazing searcher that can search spells/trap and add it from deck to your hand. We use Pikari @Ignister effect to search When A.I. First Meet You/A.I.dle Reborn depending on what card we have in hand.  2x Doyon @Ignister  We use Doyon @Ignister effect to add back to hand @Ignister monster and spell in graveyard.  2x Bururu @Ignister  We use Bururu @Ignister effect to send 1 @Ignister monster to graveyard, the best part is to send Danmari @Ignister, also we use Bururu @Ignister to synchro summon and trigger it’s effect to special summon other monster which has been used as synchro material.  3x Achichi @Ignister  Achichi @Ignister also an amazing searcher like Pikari @Ignister, he search @Ignister monster and add it from deck to your hand. We use Achichi @Ignister effect to search other @Ignister monster to maximize our combo, depending on what card we have in hand.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Spells</div></blockquote> 3x When A.I. First Meet You  Reveal 1 cyberse monster and add 1 @Ignister monster with the same attribute, that is a very good thing, but there is another problem that we have to take 2300 damage if you didn’t special summon the revealed monster. Eldlich and Amazement only pay 800 LP while we burn 2300 LP, sort of mission impossible for me. The best way to use it is to search Doyon @Ignister and Bururu @Ignister, because in our combo we will definitely link summon Dark Infant @Ignister and synchro summon Wind Pegasus @Ignister.  3x Cynet Mining  Another spell for search @Ignister monster, but you need to send 1 card from your hand to the graveyard. It's quite risky, but we have no other choice at the moment, for now, maybe.  3x Three Tactical Talent  I choose Three Tactical Talent as supporting spell in this deck. This card has 3 effects that is draw 2 cards, take control 1 monster your opponent control and look at opponent hand choose 1 card from it and shuffle into the deck. I choose this card as a support over the Pot of Desires, Pot of Extravagance and Pot of Prosperity. This card is the safest choice because it will not interfere with the performance of this deck, like banish 10 cards from top of your deck or banish some monster from your extra. Other alternatives for Three Tactical Talent if you don't like this card is Pot of Avarice, since you only shuffle back to deck 5 monsters in graveyard and draw 2 cards, this is another great option to increase durability and recovery. I recommend this card more because I know TCG deck has a lot of hand traps in their main deck, and it will help to trigger this card effect with lots of options offered from this card.  1x Monster Reborn  Target 1 monster in either graveyard and special summon it. It's important to turn the tide and a nice spell to recovery.  1x Harpie’s Feather Duster  One of the best removal spell and trap in Yu-Gi-Oh! I choose to play this over Lightning Storm. The reason is because the @Ignister archetype really needs their field spells, which is quite the opposite of Lightning Storm requirement that’s if you control no face-up card you can activate 1 of 2 effect. Based on my experience it is quite rare for my opponents to choose to destroy field spells, they prefer monsters instead. Lightning Storm might fit in the 2nd turn but for the 1st turn it will be quite a hassle in certain situations.  2x Ignister A.I. Land  The most important thing from the @Ignister archetype, because with this card we can carry out the best combos. Sometimes many people forget the best effect this card has, if this card in your graveyard you can banish 1 @Ignister monster from graveyard and set this card. As long as we don't meet the Cosmic Cyclone, everything will be fine.  3x A.I.dle Reborn  This is a quick spell that can target 1 @Ignister monster in your graveyard and special summon it. If this card is in graveyard you can banish this card and 1 card from your hand then add back 1 A.I. spell/trap that’s banished or in your graveyard except this card.  3x Forbidden Droplet  Still the best card for overcoming Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon and this card is a quick spell. You can use field spell Ignister A.I. Land instead of @Ignister monster to activate this card, because we can set back Ignister A.I. from graveyard by banish 1 @Ignister monster.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Extra</div></blockquote> 1x Wind Pegasus @Ignister  I choose Wind Pegasus @Ignister over the Cyberse Quantum Dragon, because Wind Pegasus @Ignister can destroy spell/trap your opponent controls up to the number of @Ignisiter monsters you control, and we can banish this card then target 1 card your opponent control shuffle it into deck.  1x Light Dragon @Ignister  XYZ monster that can destroy face-up monster and can special summon 1 link monster from your graveyard if another cyberse monster inflict battle damage, also this card is light attribute that can be used to trigger When A.I. First Meet You and add Pikari @Ignister.  1x The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister  Front line defense from this deck and also one of the boss monsters in this deck. A.I. from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this  1x Accesscode Talker  Second boss and Yusaku Fujiki from Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS approve this. You can combine this with The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister and make Accesscode Talker have 8300 ATK, this number is come from 2300 ATK as basic ATK of Accesscode Talker plus 6000 ATK from Link 6 that’s The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister have or you can use normal combo with Transcode Talker and Update Jammer so Accesscode Talker can attack twice.  2x Transcode Talker  We need it 2 copies, 1 for link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister and other 1 for link summon Accesscode Talker.  1x Decode Talker Heatsoul  Substitute for Fire Phoenix @Ignister, also he burn 1000 LP for draw 1 card. Amazing.  1x Dark Templar @Ignister  Let's fill the board with @Ignister monster. He is the beginning to summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister.  1x Update Jammer  Make Accesscode Talker can attack twice.  2x Splash Mage  Same like Transcode Talker we need it to link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister and Accesscode Talker, also it's a nice card that help in link climbing.  1x Cyberse Wicckid  Only used to search Bururu @Ignister.  2x Dark Infant @Ignister  1 Link monster, who can add Ignister A.I. Land from deck to your hand. 2 copy is needed, 1 for search field spell and 1 to trigger Dark Templar @Ignister effect.  1x Link Spider  Why spider links? Because we have normal monsters in this deck? Did you guys forget we have Nibiru, The Primal Being and PSY-Frame Driver. This card is quite useful if your opponent drops Nibiru, The Primal Being.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Side</div></blockquote> 1x Dinowrestler Pankratops  Hidden beater.  1x Artifact Lancea  With this card we can stop opponent banish cards for one 1 turn. In several duels VS Drytron, Drytron always drops this card when I finishes link summon Accesscode Talker, really annoying. So we're going to play defense with a Crossout Designator.  1x Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion  Ghost Belle &amp; Haunted Mansion is also a problem in itself when I using Dark Templar @Ignister and Doyon @Ignister effect.  1x Skull Meister  Eldlich used this card a lot in their main deck, so 1 copy for Crossout Designator.  1x Droll &amp; Lock Bird  With this card we can stop opponent add more card from deck to hand.  1x Called by The Grave  Virtual World used this card in their main deck, just in case, so 1 copy.  2x Cosmic Cyclone  The real problem is coming from Cosmic Cyclone since this card is banish and not send to graveyard, really bad for field spell Ignister A.I. Land, so 2 copy for Crossout Designator also this is a decent removal by pay 1000 LP.  3x Crossout Designator  Good under certain conditions, but because I tested this deck by dueling with the TCG deck, this card is better to be a side, because we can first observe in the first duel what hand traps the opponent has and prepare the counter. Also the thing to remember is this card only negate one card for 1 turn and not counter back and send it to graveyard, so in next turn opponent can use it back. This card only provides temporary protection. As an alternative you can play 3 Torrential Tribute and 3 Solemn Strike as a better defense in a slow game tempo.  1x Infinite Impermanence  Believe it or not this one is more troublesome than a monster hand trap, because this card is a trap card and we cannot trigger an effect from Three Tactical Talent since it’s need monster effect.  1x Solemn Strike  Pay 1500 LP.  1x Solemn Judgement  Pay Half LP.  1x Imperial Order  This is a troublesome card because it completely stops @Ignister, we can't use spell cards.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 1st turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 3000 ATK, strong 6/10</li>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 4000 ATK, very strong 7/10</li>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 5000 ATK, almost perfect 8/10</li>  	<li>Link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with 6000 ATK, perfect 9/10</li> </ol> Note: The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister is unaffected by other cards effect, it’s mean that Nibiru, The Primal Being, Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, Borrelsword Dragon, Raigeki, Lightning Strom, Forbidden Droplet, Ice Dragon’s Prison, Solemn Strike and Solemn Judgement can't touch The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister  Note: The only thing that can beat The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister is Kaiju.  Recommendation: I recommend that you all link summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister with atleast 4000 ATK, since Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon, Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder and True King of Calamities have 3000 ATK the opponent can carry out a suicide attack and destroy The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister by battle. Also Invoked Augeoeides can make his ATK over 4000 depending on situations and conditions in duel.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Strategy in 2nd turn</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Use The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister that already link summon in 1st turn, strong 6/10</li>  	<li>Link summon Accesscode Talker with 5300 ATK, very strong 7/10</li>  	<li>Link summon Accesscode Talker with 8300 ATK, almost perfect 8/10</li> </ol> Recommendation: You all better not rush to make Accesscode Talker by sacrifice The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister because you will waste the only one of the strongest defenses in this deck.  &nbsp; <blockquote><div>Basic combo using Achichi @Ignister in 1st turn to make The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister 5000 ATK</div></blockquote> <ol>  	<li>Normal summon Achichi @Ignister and search Pikari @Ignister</li>  	<li>Link summon Dark Infant @Ignister and search Ignister A.I.

This really solidifies your position on the board.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another combo is the nephthys rebirth, a level 2, conductor, and two spare cards in your hand. Ritual summon conductor using the level 2, use her effect to summon devotee, use devotee to summon disciple, disciple effect to destroy the spare hand card and search sacred phoenix, link devotee and disciple to make preserver, preserver effect search cerulean phoenix and recycle ritual spell in graveyard, devotee effect destroy other spare hand card and summon it, play ritual spell and tribute sacred phoenix to summon cerulean. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Three rituals summoned for the main event... sacred flame, at this point you might wonder why you would do this with killing so many resources. To put it simply, two things, the first thing is that the materials are able to be fished out of the deck really quickly and the second thing is that the cards you sacrificed from your hand may also trigger effects and extend your combo to make even more threats (like the true kings to make a VFD as well).</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Another little thing I found out is that you can ritual devotee, summon a nephthys, link both for cross sheep, then devotee can summon herself from the graveyard to trigger cross sheep’s draw 2 discard 2 effect.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I really like using this deck and I hope you guys might enjoy it too!

It's pretty versatile, draws a lot, OTKs often, and have good defences for brick hand situations. I rarely lose if I have Infinite Light active but I'm not a big fan of Infinite-trio either as I believe it takes too much space (5 to have 3-1-1 ratio) that can be dead draws too if drawn in the wrong order. And you don't always get to the final step of it anyway or you get it started too late. I prefer using 5 slots for better synergy and draws.

Once summoned activate Hajun's effect to special summon Dakki the Graceful Mayakashi from the deck. Then you should go into the level 3 Mayakashi synchro, activate Dakki's graveyard effect to special summon itself to go into the level 5 Mayakashi synchro monster using Dakki and the level 3 synchro monster to do so. Then you just keep synchro summoning using Dakki and a Mayakashi synchro monster until you go into your level 11 Mayakashi synchro monster. Now you have milled out a large chunk of your opponents deck and have a level 11 synchro monster. You can use the many revival cards to revive Dakki and the level 3 Mayakashi synchro to summon until you have the level 9 and level 11 synchro monsters on the field. As you special summon opponents deck gets thinner by the effect of Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower and with zombie world on the field all monsters they summon also count as zombie monsters to make it even easier to deck your opponent out."

The main strategy of this deck is field control. Use your resources to control the field until you can bring out your more powerful monsters the level 7's. Combined with Sea Stealth Attack, the level 5 &amp; 7 monsters are a nuisance. An ideal field is to get A Legendary Ocean, Sea Stealth Attack, and 2 water monsters on the field doesn't really matter which.  I would recommend at least 1 or more Gameciel in the main deck if you can figure out what to take out for it."

Your main goal is to either stall your opponent/break their bo","Very much on the expensive side, but this is a work in progress. So it's best to copy this to a dueling site/game (I use duelingnexus.com), then adjust it there for your liking. Even though it has 52 cards in the Main Deck it's been incredibly consistent so far.  I won't write down any combos, because  Shaddolls in my opinion (this build at least) are intuitive. I will say say though that you can use Nadir Servant  to send Apkallone to the grave  to search for your Shaddoll cards, which is why I run so many-- you could however replace one with  Titaniklad or Elder Entity N'tss if you want to search more Dogmatikas/pop more cards. You can use  gravity controller to get rid of troublesome boss monsters. In the Side Deck I haven't personally used the Galaxy Eyes monster, Mekk-Knight Crusadia and Nightmare Gryphon yet, but I'm sure they'll be useful in some match-ups (can use Construct to make the Galaxy Eyes). Lastly the generic traps can be swapped out with what you want like Solemn Strike instead of Torrential Tribute(I like Torrential because it triggers the Shaddoll effects too), which makes the deck a bit flexible (just keep in mind the traps that discard obviously really  help the deck)."
