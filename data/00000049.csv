Show those trespassers the divine wrath of angels.,"<p>So, this is a deck for a format called Domain! Rules of deckbuilding are simple, for those unaware.<br /><br />1. 60 card main, 15 card extra deck, singleton, no banlist.<br />2. I can use any spells and traps I desire, however I can only use cards that fit my ""Deckmaster's Domain"", in this case my Deckmaster is the Harest Angel Of Doom (Hence it being in my sideboard). Domain consists of all cards of the Deckmaster's attribute, type, any archetypes listed in their name, as well as any attributes, types, archetypes, and exact statlines listed in the Deckmaster's text, with the exclusion of reminder text (aside from archetypal, like summoned skull being an archfiend).<br /><br />In this case, I can use any dark monster, and any fairy monster. So, I decided to go with Sanctuary In The Sky, a mix of Counter Fairies, Parshath, and The Agents! I want opinions on this. Also, the Barian's Chaos Draw is really supposed to be a Seventh Tachyon, but it wasn't on here when I moved the deck in.<br /><br />Goal is simple. Control the board, and beat face while they have nothing. More difficult as this is singleton and against 3 other people, but that's what I like about this deck- the challenge. Plus, it makes Iron Thunder hilarious due to the way collumns work in Domain, hehe.</p>"

It got me to try master duel, and start my whole journey.&nbsp;<br /><br />My second favorite archetype was Ogdoadic, because I raise and care for reptiles, and the just looked like the would go perfectly with Ra. I was able to make a deck with Bishbaalkin, the one from DarkArmedDuelists channel, that essentially let me add Slifer and Ra, and use them pretty consistantly without having to normal summon. But once Bishbaalkin was banned that deck was no longer usable on masterduel. I was no longer able to use both in a useable way. In comes Horus (which Horus himself looks like Ra). It lets us increase our starters and get maximum consistancy.<br /><br />HOW THE DECK WORKS<br /><br />Deck Breakdown:<br /><br />12 starters:<br />Ogdoadic: 3x Nunu, 3x Nauya<br />Horus: 3x Imsety, 3x King's Sacophagus<br /><br />9 Conditional starters/extenders:<br />Ogdoadic: 3x Ogdoadic daybreak, 1x Ogdoadic Serpent Strike, 1x Ogdoadic Water Lily, 1x Zohah<br />Reptile: 1x Black Mamba, 1x Night Sword Serpent, 1x I.A.S. Invasive Alien Species<br /><br />9 Bricks (extenders when sent to graveyard, often with Horus engine):<br />2x Guardian Slime, The Ogdoadic Light &amp; Dark, Both Ogdoadic Overlords, Blessing, Protection and Guidance of Horus<br /><br />10 Ra Summons/Seachers:<br />2x Winged Dragon of Ra, 2x Sphere Mode, 3x Ancient Chant, 3x The True Sun God<br /><br />Exta deck:<br />Necassary: Fera Imps is needed for the Nunu 1 card combo<br />Conditional:<br />-Galaxy-eyes cards optional, 2 card destroyed on the field, change of heart that can be used as material for rank up, protection for light monsters, or an omni-negate.<br />-Number 97 engine and Nummeron Dragon optional, just for OTK if you dont get Ra, a spell negate, or defense piercing dmg<br />-Alien Shocktrooper and Cosmic Slicer, optional, especially if you go first, and can get lots of tokens on the field, it&nbsp; basically negates all on field opponent monsters and changes them to defense position, if you add alien kid to the deck and swap it out with one of the non Ogdoadic Reptile cards.<br />-Lizadose Optional, banish reptile from gy draw one<br />-Echidina Optional, makes an opponents monster 0 atk, good for OTK<br /><br />Goal of the Deck:<br />To get Ra on the field going 2nd with a 6 card hand basically every single hand in a digitially shuffled or a well in person shuffled deck. I have tested 20 hands and was always able to either get Ra on the field, or&nbsp; 3/20 instances go into Nummeron Dragon or Galaxy-Eyes Dragon. The following figures are based upon the Yugioh Probability Calculator.<br /><br />Basically we have 12 starters that can each individually get 3 bodies on the field for Ra, as a 1 card combo(nunu is the only one that would require using a normal summon to get 3 monsters on the field, the other 9 require no normal summons), and combined with the 9 situational starters (situation being 1 normal summonable reptile monster), we are going to have about 92.93% chance to open with 2 of any of these 21 cards.&nbsp;<br />But if we just want to concider the 12 starters, we have a 90.18% chance to draw at least 1 of them.<br /><br />With 10 Ra cards, we have a 84.53% chance to draw at least 1 Ra card. (Im not counting Guardian Slime which is classified as a brick/conditional extender, but if we include it, it rises to 90.18%)<br /><br />With 9 Brick/Conditional Extender Cards, we have a 80.82% chance to draw at least 1, 40.98% chance to draw at least 2, and an 11.47% chance to draw at least 3, and an 1.63% to drawing at least 4.&nbsp;<br /><br />Basically you are competing against a very small likelyhood you would draw 3 or 4 bricks, and there is an exremely high likelyhood you will draw at least 1 one card combo starter, and a Ra/Searcher. (If you add 3 Ashes and 3 Maxx C, for 46 cards, it lowers the chance to pull 1 one card starter combo by 5%, so it goes from 90% to 85%)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>"

The fairies actually make the deck worse but they were the only reason i made this deck.<br />The combo starts with lady past and light on the field (you can summon, one for one, hikari or fortune visions -&gt; lady calling them).<br />Activate past's effect to increase her level, using light. Activate light's effect to summon lady water, synchro summon 999 times charge warrior and catastor with desynchro for bootleg pot of greed. You should end up with zoroa, a 2/3 monsters apo if you manage to hold calling and a bunch of useless shit. Half of the deck (dangers/magicians soul) is used to draw stuff, to get free bodies and to recycle the useless crap in hand.<br />If you manage to summon 2 pasts, you can also end up with crystal wing and hatsune miku in the graveyard!</p>"
