Show those trespassers the divine wrath of angels.,"<p>So, this is a deck for a format called Domain! Rules of deckbuilding are simple, for those unaware.<br /><br />1. 60 card main, 15 card extra deck, singleton, no banlist.<br />2. I can use any spells and traps I desire, however I can only use cards that fit my ""Deckmaster's Domain"", in this case my Deckmaster is the Harest Angel Of Doom (Hence it being in my sideboard). Domain consists of all cards of the Deckmaster's attribute, type, any archetypes listed in their name, as well as any attributes, types, archetypes, and exact statlines listed in the Deckmaster's text, with the exclusion of reminder text (aside from archetypal, like summoned skull being an archfiend).<br /><br />In this case, I can use any dark monster, and any fairy monster. So, I decided to go with Sanctuary In The Sky, a mix of Counter Fairies, Parshath, and The Agents! I want opinions on this. Also, the Barian's Chaos Draw is really supposed to be a Seventh Tachyon, but it wasn't on here when I moved the deck in.<br /><br />Goal is simple. Control the board, and beat face while they have nothing. More difficult as this is singleton and against 3 other people, but that's what I like about this deck- the challenge. Plus, it makes Iron Thunder hilarious due to the way collumns work in Domain, hehe.</p>"

It got me to try master duel, and start my whole journey.&nbsp;<br /><br />My second favorite archetype was Ogdoadic, because I raise and care for reptiles, and the just looked like the would go perfectly with Ra. I was able to make a deck with Bishbaalkin, the one from DarkArmedDuelists channel, that essentially let me add Slifer and Ra, and use them pretty consistantly without having to normal summon. But once Bishbaalkin was banned that deck was no longer usable on masterduel. I was no longer able to use both in a useable way. In comes Horus (which Horus himself looks like Ra).

Invasive Alien Species<br /><br />9 Bricks (extenders when sent to graveyard, often with Horus engine):<br />2x Guardian Slime, The Ogdoadic Light &amp; Dark, Both Ogdoadic Overlords, Blessing, Protection and Guidance of Horus<br /><br />10 Ra Summons/Seachers:<br />2x Winged Dragon of Ra, 2x Sphere Mode, 3x Ancient Chant, 3x The True Sun God<br /><br />Exta deck:<br />Necassary: Fera Imps is needed for the Nunu 1 card combo<br />Conditional:<br />-Galaxy-eyes cards optional, 2 card destroyed on the field, change of heart that can be used as material for rank up, protection for light monsters, or an omni-negate.<br />-Number 97 engine and Nummeron Dragon optional, just for OTK if you dont get Ra, a spell negate, or defense piercing dmg<br />-Alien Shocktrooper and Cosmic Slicer, optional, especially if you go first, and can get lots of tokens on the field, it&nbsp; basically negates all on field opponent monsters and changes them to defense position, if you add alien kid to the deck and swap it out with one of the non Ogdoadic Reptile cards.<br />-Lizadose Optional, banish reptile from gy draw one<br />-Echidina Optional, makes an opponents monster 0 atk, good for OTK<br /><br />Goal of the Deck:<br />To get Ra on the field going 2nd with a 6 card hand basically every single hand in a digitially shuffled or a well in person shuffled deck. I have tested 20 hands and was always able to either get Ra on the field, or&nbsp; 3/20 instances go into Nummeron Dragon or Galaxy-Eyes Dragon. The following figures are based upon the Yugioh Probability Calculator.<br /><br />Basically we have 12 starters that can each individually get 3 bodies on the field for Ra, as a 1 card combo(nunu is the only one that would require using a normal summon to get 3 monsters on the field, the other 9 require no normal summons), and combined with the 9 situational starters (situation being 1 normal summonable reptile monster), we are going to have about 92.93% chance to open with 2 of any of these 21 cards.&nbsp;<br />But if we just want to concider the 12 starters, we have a 90.18% chance to draw at least 1 of them.<br /><br />With 10 Ra cards, we have a 84.53% chance to draw at least 1 Ra card. (Im not counting Guardian Slime which is classified as a brick/conditional extender, but if we include it, it rises to 90.18%)<br /><br />With 9 Brick/Conditional Extender Cards, we have a 80.82% chance to draw at least 1, 40.98% chance to draw at least 2, and an 11.47% chance to draw at least 3, and an 1.63% to drawing at least 4.&nbsp;<br /><br />Basically you are competing against a very small likelyhood you would draw 3 or 4 bricks, and there is an exremely high likelyhood you will draw at least 1 one card combo starter, and a Ra/Searcher. (If you add 3 Ashes and 3 Maxx C, for 46 cards, it lowers the chance to pull 1 one card starter combo by 5%, so it goes from 90% to 85%)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>"

The fairies actually make the deck worse but they were the only reason i made this deck.<br />The combo starts with lady past and light on the field (you can summon, one for one, hikari or fortune visions -&gt; lady calling them).<br />Activate past's effect to increase her level, using light. Activate light's effect to summon lady water, synchro summon 999 times charge warrior and catastor with desynchro for bootleg pot of greed. You should end up with zoroa, a 2/3 monsters apo if you manage to hold calling and a bunch of useless shit. Half of the deck (dangers/magicians soul) is used to draw stuff, to get free bodies and to recycle the useless crap in hand.<br />If you manage to summon 2 pasts, you can also end up with crystal wing and hatsune miku in the graveyard!</p>"

You could experiment with 1 of each golem, but prepare to loose to one runick spell if your unlucky.</p><p>Note: With support in the form of dragon and Statue, this deck gets some more options for going second, mainly being able to replace frame and being able to summon wyvern later into an uninterupted combo, more akin to the geartown catapult 2 card combo which generates significant advantage.</p><p>When playing with dark golem, judge your need of the fusion spell with the cards in your hand / grave, if you havent used catapult in summoning it (tanker usually or a popped geartown), you can add geartown catapult, discard catapult, and give your access to an additional monster, if tanker hasnt been used, this may fetch your searchers for the fusion spells later, while allowing you to more efficiently delay your opponent with chaos giant / bagooska pass, or chaos giant + dugaress for double attack.</p>"

Basically this is what happens when I try to figure out how to make Ashened work.</p><p><em><strong>V1: Pure Ashened</strong></em></p><p>By God it doesn't work. Don't let those YouTube videos with all their bombastic titles fool you. Cross my heart, this deck when run pure is just Dark Hole Dragon with extra steps. You'll wonder why the field is empty, then you'll realize you did all that yourself in the first place... on turn 1. Just don't.</p><p><em><strong>V2: Ashened Gaia</strong></em></p><p>Fusion Armament from Duelist Nexus gave the deck a nice tech: Gaia Prominence, The Fierce Force. For some reason both it and its named material Gaia Blaze, Force of The Sun are both Pyro monsters. That's a monster negate in 4 summons, insulating you from a certain space rock. However, it trades with your main Ashened line, resulting in a weaker Veidos due to being summoned with less materials.</p><p><em><strong>V3: Ashened Despia</strong></em></p><p>When you think of Fusion-centric decks, Branded is the first thing that comes to mind, so I drafted this up. Obviously we can't fit the entire arsenal in here, but with what few cards that fit in, it does <em><strong>wonders&nbsp;</strong></em>for the deck. God bless Albaz.</p><p>It gives you extra body rapidly, plays around your locks (you can even apply two locks -Fusion and Pyro- and still play through if you know what you're doing), but most importantly: it gave the deck an objective to build towards.</p><p>Basic gameplan here is to make sure you always have an access to a Fusion Summon. Where do the materials come from is a secondary concern-- Branded doesn't care. Haven't playtested this one as of the initial post, will update when I have more data.</p>"

Kycoo for chaos. Asura priest and spear dragons for Goats and combos with robbin goblin to get huge discards in one turn or when opponent sets/has goats. Triple bladeknight for damage and BLS. Warrior returning alive is an underrated pick that can substitute the second Zaloog. Back to square one is a strong removal that bounces on top of deck, goes together in combo with DROP OFF, which is the focus of the deck together with time seal.

Ty for any feedback! :)</p><p>Melodious and Solfachord are two very similar archetypes, both of them incorporate fairy types pendulum monsters and a strong love for music! It's basically a match made in heaven. To give more consistency to the deck, I added a Herald + Hierarchia core, which perfectly supports this deck as it allows for an easy Cutia from the deck!</p><p>Solfachord's boss monster, GranSolfachord Coolia, is a very cool piece for an endboard, as it acts as an omninegate! She also provides fantastic extra zones for Pendulum summons. With Solfachord's main strength being its ability to fill the extra deck with face-up Pendulum monsters, it is a way to gain additional bodies fairly easily, therefore providing the deck a solid endboard!</p><p>This deck's most important combo is the one described in this video from ggGio on youtube, the classic Melodious routing. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: var(--link-decoration); cursor: pointer; outline: 0px; word-break: break-word; white-space-collapse: break-spaces; background-color: rgba(2, 2, 2, 0.06); font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;""><a href=""https://youtu.be/RIr6P_NUIrY?si=ie5FK5JldlOBAtRd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/RIr6P_NUIrY?si=ie5FK5JldlOBAtRd</a></span></p><p>s/o to Anoter for helping me build this prototype, ty bro &lt;3</p>"
