This deck is pretty consistent, theres not much to say about it, it's a control deck. You want to go first and setup a negate(s) and or interruptions with Mechaba and the True Draco cards. Triple <a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a> was actually really nice, if you don't like it you can take it out and replace with something of your choosing.

You can either go the immortal dragunity strategy of always having dragunity monsters easily summon able with divine lance equipped or otherwise, or you can do the dragon drowning strategy. getting as many dragons out on the field as possible suffocating your opponent in sheer power and size. its not a very meta deck but it has a lot of ways where, despite the inherent inconsistency of the 60 cards its very good at finding a playable strategy with almost any cards in hand. once again not meta, so you wound be pulling off massive combos in the first turn. its a good deck to feel powerful but slow down the gameplay a little for some fun."

Another staple 3 of.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Dark Magician Girl: This card is mainly used as a beatstick, as it has an easy summoning condition to fulfill, and has the ability to attack the turn it is summoned. BLS does a slightly better job at what this card does, however.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Cyber Dragon: Toon Cyber Dragon is an alright card, as it does have the amazing effect of Cyber Dragon. This card is mainly used for plays with Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon and Cyber Dragon Infinity.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Mermaid: While this card doesn’t have an incredible effect, it can be special summoned for free, and is not limited to once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Harpie Lady: This card is similar to Toon Mermaid in the fact that it can be summoned for free, and even allows you to pop a Spell/Trap if another Toon is on board, but it can only be summoned once per turn, which is why it’s at 2.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Eater Of Millions: This card synergizes well with the negative effect of Toon Kingdom, turning it into a positive for this card. It’s also a good piece of removal. For its summoning condition, you should banish the entire Extra Deck, except for: Cyber Dragon Nova, Cyber Dragon Infinity, and Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x The Black Stone Of Legend: Allows you to summon Red-Eyes Toon Dragon for free, and lets you recycle it from GY.</span>  &nbsp;  <span><strong><span>The Spells/Traps:</span></strong></span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Comic Hand: An incredible card, allowing for a lot of cheesy plays. It’s very easy to sneak wins off of this card. It’s even better now, considering it is able to be searched with Toon Bookmark.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Kingdom: Is a great replacement for Toon World, as it treats itself as Toon World when on the field, and offers protection for your Toons. However, it’s cost for its effect is quite the downside at times.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x One For One: Used to search The Black Stone Of Legend.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Terraforming: Used to search Toon Kingdom.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Bookmark: A great search card, allowing you to search Comic Hand where Toon Table Of Contents could not. However, it balances this out by being a once per turn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Table Of Contents: Your main search card, used to get cards such as Toon Bookmark, Toon Kingdom, and any of your Toon monsters.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Page-Flip: Used as a one of, because drawing into it without Toon Kingdom is really bad, and the card itself isn’t a necessity, and is more of a “nice to have” card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Terror: Amazing negate.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Extra Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon: Good card that pairs well with Toon Cyber Dragon, letting you remove an opponent’s monster for free.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 38 Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy: Used mainly for its negate effect. It’s a great summon if you can get 2 Toon Black Luster Soldiers, or 1 Toon Black Luster Soldier and an Toon Ancient Gear Golem on board.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Number 11 Big Eye: You’re more likely to get this on field than you would Number 38. It’s used for its control effect. However, Comic Hand is better, so it’s best to use Comic Hand over this card.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Nova: Used with Cyber Dragon Infinty; overlay your 2 Toon Cyber Dragons to summon this.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Cyber Dragon Infinity: Yet another incredible negate, along with a removal effect that doesn’t target.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Time Thief Redoer: Used as an easy to summon Rank 4 with generic materials and a great effect.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Abyss Dweller: Same reasons as Time Thief Redoer.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Gagaga Cowboy: Same reasons as Abyss Dweller and Time Thief Redoer.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Borrelsword Dragon: Good boss monster, and a staple Link.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Unicorn: Good spot removal.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Knightmare Phoenix: Pops an s/t, and is easier to summon than Unicorn.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Linkuriboh: Ran in case of bricks with Black Stone Of Legend.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Relinquished Anima: Same reason as Linkuriboh.</span>  &nbsp;  <strong><span>The Side Deck:</span></strong>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Buster Blader: Used for its level, being viable material for Number 11, and is supposed to replace Toon Ancient Gear Golem.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Barrel Dragon: Again, used for its ability to be material for Number 11, and is used to replace Toon Ancient Gear Golem. Its effect, while being a gamble effect, is still relatively useful.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Cyber Dragon: In case you want to consistently get out Cyber Dragon Infinity.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Harpie Lady: In case you want to get your Rank 4s out easier.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Bahamut Shark: Used with Toon Mermaid as material, and its intended effect target is Toadally Awesome.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toadally Awesome: Great Bahamut Shark target, you could even say it’s totally awesome.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Mimicat: Isn’t ran in Main Deck due to its lack of usefulness. It’s heavily outclassed by Comic Hand. But, if your opponent runs a lot of staple spells/traps, this may be an okay card to run.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Page-Flip: Used if you want to see Page-Flip more.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1x Toon Terror: Good negation.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3x Toon Briefcase: While this card doesn’t negate summons, it can completely mess up plays by removing key monsters from the field without destroying or targeting.</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2x Toon Mask: Good summoning effect, but it’s a bit too reliant on the opponent running high level monsters.</span>"

Let me run down the details real quick:  I made this new deck so that you could do one of three things: <ol>  	<li>Pay life points to have something awesome happen</li>  	<li>Gain life points to keep yourself in the game</li>  	<li>draw extra cards so you are never out of a viable option</li> </ol> If you guys have followed my past decks, you know that I am better at making 60-card decks; this deck is another example of that.  I even made it so that the extra deck contains all cards that have to do with one of the three themes that I put into the main deck.  It was hard but I hope you like it and we can forget about the whole ""Exodia"" Thing for the time being.  If you still want to hold a grudge, that is fine, but I have done everything I can to fix my mistake so please take your grudge somewhere else.  Please enjoy the replacement deck that I worked really hard on and even tested for you guys!"

The main playing style of this deck is to spam out Trickstar monsters, activate their effects to burn, and go into the bigger links, most likely Bella Modanna. You'll want to activate lots of effects as you go, to burn as much as you can. You'll also want to set up a Live Stage before you link climb, as it provides more link materials. And, if your opponent has a board that's really hard to out, you can go into Accescode Talker instead. This is my first Trickstar deck, so any suggestions are appreciated; it's more so a rough test to try them out."

Even if you start running out of cards you always have final count down. So just last till then and you will win almost every time."

The XYZ extra deck is something you can change, depends on your playstyle.  Same for the side-deck. It's something you can change as you want and depends on the meta. My side deck is just an idea.  This deck is good going first, but sadly it's very sensitive to Handtraps. One Droll &amp; lock bird and you can surrend. If your loop get negated, this is hard too. That's why I play <a data-name=""Triple Tactics Talent"">Triple Tactics Talent.</a>  Thanks for reading and I hope you like it!  Here is a quick combo video I made:  https://youtu.be/6SXCSCSux8s"

The strategy works by firing off with Rikka Petal consistently from the first turn and during every turn you're able - DNA Surgery could make this easier given that the Extra Deck uses a lot of the Galaxy-Eyes and other Dragon Rank 8s because of how easily you can go into them via Snowdrop. Rikka Petal can fetch you Snowdrop or Mudan from the deck every turn and with just those two cards you can build the entire strategy. The idea is to flood the field via Snowdrop's effect of summoning two Rikka cards by tributing Petal, with Primula in hand as well, this becomes 3 and they can all be changed to Level 8, 4 or 6 via Snowdrop. This gives you access to all three of the deck's boss monsters (Teardrop, Strenna and Kanzashi respectively, or even Number 87: Queen of the Night!) and can lead to systematically removing your opponent's monsters by using Rikka Flurries off of Mudan's fetch effect. Once Snowdrop hits the GY (you ideally want to detach her from any Xyz monster first), simply use Rikka Tranquility to bring her back and circumvent her locking effect. With a recycled Snowdrop, the Galaxy-Eyes and Dragon Xyz portion of the Extra Deck becomes available to use and finish off your opponent with overwhelming prejudice.  By using either Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, or the small portion of Blue-Eyes support as well, you want to link into Galaxy Satellite Dragon for the final combo (if you can get Galaxy-Eyes Solflare Dragon out too, that's a bonus) in cooperation with Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon. Combine these dragons' effects together and Tachyon Dragon will soar to 10,700 attack points, attacking your opponent twice, and negating their board for that Battle Phase. At that point, the game is over.  Constantly tributing your Rikka and plant monsters will keep Rikka Flurries firing off, which forces your opponent to tribute their own monsters. And with a plant material on any of your Teardrops, her effect becomes a quickie and will tribute yet more monsters for your opponent. A cheeky tech is using Strenna in rapid play and tributing her to fire off Flurries and gain a fresh Teardrop and using her effect too. With Kanzashi on the field with them, you don't even have to tribute cards you don't want.  The real gem in this deck, is Rikka Petal - providing you control only plants or no monsters at all, she comes back to the field during your opponent's End Phase. And this can be extremely annoying for them to try and deal with. Even if they banish one of her, you still have two copies, and even Lonefire Blossom to fetch her again and again. Constantly recycling Snowdrop and Mudan with Tranquility can recycle so much of your GY, so don't worry about your deck thinning, this is what you want. Combining DNA Surgery, or possibly even two copies of it can help you keep Flurries on the field, as well as dealing with the Zombie World Deck at Rogue currently by making your Rikkas plant monsters even after they've played Zombie World. In addition, Rikka isn't effected much by Buster Blader and his deck given that you can force them to tribute around the Swordsman/Dragon lock combo and then use Teardrop to get rid of the other one once you're out of it.  In combination with the Rank 8 package, this deck just becomes mean with a consistent method of summoning monster after monster with 3000+ attack points or equally annoying effects."

Typically you would like to see a first hand consisting of Dragonmaid Ernus, Kitchen/Parlor Dragonmaid, Interrupted Kaiju Slumber/Any Kaiju and either a utility spell (Dragonmaid Hospitality or World Legacy Guarddragon) or another smaller girl such as Nurse (to be used in tandem with Kitchen and/or Parlor to recycle whatever you feel the need to ditch) or Chamber Dragonmaid to push for a very early Fusion. In my opinion, Sheou should be brought out first to bait a negation or any other kind of response, given her effect to give you a free House Dragonmaid after the fact. You want to have House out during those standby phases if you don't have the full quattro of smaller girls and if going for the Kaiju strategy, she can help push for total game if you're able to revive or summon two girls.  Going 2nd, and with Kaijus, House and only two other Dragonmaids will win you game providing your opponent is either asleep at the wheel or you outsmart them with either Sheou or some other trickery. Chamber can fetch you Changeover and any other Dragonmaid spell in the deck and thus is essential when played with Kitchen/Parlor - these two smaller girls are your main combo with their ditching and fetching effects, Nurse acts as a total bonus if you can play her with them. Laundry is not to be overlooked either, and she can easily come through for you, given that she only ditches three cards and can come from behind with this if you're lacking in Kitchen. If played with Nurse, you hopefully can recycle something for a series of effects.  Note! The start of your or your opponent's Battle Phase provides the opportunity to tag out your little dragons for their bigger counterparts (either from hand or the GY, which means you can chain both Ernus and/or Tinkhec for basically entirely free effects) but these effects of the smaller girls DO NOT chain. Tagging out Kitchen for Tinkhec, for example, will not cause you to chain Parlor for Lorpar. It is always the start of the Battle Phase until you declare your very first attack target, this is such an sneaky tech - on top of all that, House's pop effect doesn't chain either! Her effect is inherited by the tagging in and out. This means you can wipe your opponent's monsters away without any chains going off to potentially make your strategy vulnerable!  And like I said - Interrupted Kaiju Slumber into House +2 or just three Dragonmaids should net you the game in a single Battle Phase, but do not be afraid to play the longer game. Due to this deck's ability to play without the worry of your hand (as you'll be constantly with four cards in hand after setting up the whole board), it can actually play the grind, especially if you can give your opponent some bother with House Dragonmaid. Dragonmaid Welcome can also recycle Changeover if you control two of more Dragonmaid monsters so you can aptly go into House and Sheou as much as you need. Even if they hit the GY, Chamber can swap into them there as well!  Be confident and be bold and these lovely girls can net you a swift or a must desired win regardless of the turn or time limit. Have faith in them!"

We’re hosting the first in a series of tournaments this month The Winter Revel, with a set of custom deck building restrictions to encourage a more archetypal style of play. Check us out <a>here</a> if you’re interested.  So lately I find myself worn out by the deck building constraints of the current meta. As of now PHRA has failed to oust the top decks like Infernoble or Dragonlink from Tier One. Zoodiac have taken over the lower tiers with help from the Dogmatika engine and Divine Arsenal AA ZEUS – Sky Thunder. This has left many of my favourite decks high and dry at the lower tables; simply incapable of climbing the ladder. Luckily for anyone in this position there have been a number of smaller casual tournaments as of late with more yet to come as November unfolds. One of these encouraged me to build a new deck so I decided to revisit an old favourite: Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon. Now the title might be confusing to some, to clarify<em><u> this build does not include Chaos Max.</u></em> Now that’s out of the way this build does include a variety of level eight monsters and a small Lightsworn engine to assist with setup. All of this is tied together with a rank eight extra deck of Hope Harbinger and Draglubion plus its targets of Numbers 100 &amp; 99. This gives us a variety of options going first or second for both control or OTK lines. Join me below as I breakdown my deck building choices and a selection of effective lines. <ol start=""2"">  	<li><strong> Main Deck: Dragons, Birds, and Bigfoots Oh My</strong></li> </ol> <u><strong>Main </strong></u><u><strong>D</strong></u><u><strong>eck Monsters</strong></u>  <strong>Blue-Eyes White Dragon x 3</strong>  We start our look at the maindeck with one of the most iconic monsters in Yu-Gi-Oh history Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Famously used by Kaiba throughout the Duel Monsters arc of the anime and nearly every spin-off the character appears in. As far as Blue-Eyes goes in this build we’re mostly using it as a resource to fuel our draw engine and as extension from the grave with cards like Master with Eyes of Blue. To this end it’s fantastic as we have numerous ways to set-up and pay-off our engine like Raiden and Alternative White Dragon. Even Blue-Eyes's attribute comes in handy for extending with Levianeer. Overall while I wouldn’t run less of this as its the core resource of this build, two could be an option if you’re cutting down on Trade In in favour of other draw spells.  &nbsp;  <strong>Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon x 1</strong>  Another iconic anime monster next with Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. Used by Atticus in his final duel against Jaden in the GX arc of the anime to limited effect, Darkness Metal Dragon’s diminutive performance isn’t reflective of it’s storied competitive success. Red-Eyes Darkness Metal has had top-cut appearances starting all the way back in 2010 and continuing all the way to this year with ten top eight appearances despite the current state of in-person play. Its performance is due to this card’s effects that allows us to first summon it from the hand by banishing a face up dragon from our side of the field before summoning any dragon from the hand or grave. It’s due to the ease of summoning and generic tribal extension that this card finds itself on the limited list. Due to this we can only play one copy although if it ever comes off the list we’ll be playing more.  <strong>Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon x 1</strong>  A rather new addition here with the retrain of this deck’s namesake Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon. Most players should be familiar with the original Chaos Emperor Dragon, Envoy of the End as it was an early format-warper back in the aptly named Chaos format. The retrain was released to the public this year in Battles of Legends: Armageddon to much hype as it had already seen some competitive success, appearing in twelve topping decks since 2018. We play it here to help with setup on the play in niche hands and to assist with board clearing going second. It can even be used as an explosive finisher due to its board-wipe dealing 300 damage for each card sent to your opponent’s grave by its effect. One could play this in multiples although without greater focus on Pendulum or Guardragon combos I find it to be bricky in the hand.  <strong>Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon x 3</strong>  Next up is the card responsible for Blue-Eyes’s World Championship win in 2016 Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon. Used to great effect by Shunsuke Hiyama Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon is arguably the decks most powerful card, then and now. Between its essentially free summoning condition to its targeted pop Alternative almost always pluses while allowing us to climb into our rank eight package. We can search for Alternative a couple ways, optimally through Melody of Awakening Dragon but Chaos Space is also an option. This together is why I choose to play three Alternative, although it could be cut to two if you’re using a different rank eight engine.  <strong>Danger! Bigfoot! x 3</strong>  Onto another level eight extender; Danger! Bigfoot! Provides a similar set of benefits to the aforementioned Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon. As with all Danger! monsters Bigfoot allows us to reveal him in hand before our opponents discards a random card from our hand. If that card wasn’t Bigfoot he can then be special summoned from the hand, drawing us a card in the process. If Bigfoot was discarded we can target and pop an opponents face up card. Aside from that Bigfoot is our primary discard with Chaos Space in situations we need Alternative and don’t have Melody. Much like Alternative Bigfoot almost always pluses us while allowing for easy access to Draglubion or Hope Harbinger, hence why we play three. You can cut this in favour of other rank eight engines — Schwarzschild Limit Dragon comes to mind if you value more tribal synergy with Blue-Eyes.  <strong>Chaos Dragon Levianeer x 2</strong>  The second of our eponymous Chaos Dragons, Levianeer is a powerful extender or board clear in the right circumstances. Searchable off of Chaos Space, we have a good chance (<strong>50%</strong> going first,<strong> 57%</strong> going second) of opening Levianeer anytime we need it. More often than not its a fantastic going second play to clear problem cards from field or climb into Number F0: Utopic Future Dragon for the OTK. Due to a lack of dark attribute monsters it can sometimes be hard to get the hand-looping effect off going first but that’s not the focus of this build. If you value it more a number of dark engines could be used to increase the likelihood of resolving it. In that case I’d recommend playing three along with the dark Warrior engine and Summoner Monk to assist in seeing them more often.  <strong>Danger! Thunderbird! x 1</strong>  Our last Danger! Monster, Thunderbird is mostly here to up our chances of opening a Danger! monster. With three copies Bigfoot and one of Thunderbird we have a<strong> 42%</strong> chance to open either one going first. This is important for consistently getting our rank eight onto the board going first, although Thunderbird has utility going second as well. This is thanks to its discard effect as like Bigfoot when this card is discarded you can target and destroy one card, this time a set card instead of a face up card. Mostly we use this to clean up problem back-row like Dogmatika Punishment or the ever-popular Mystic Mine. I’ve experimented with playing two or three of these as well as an extra Danger! Monster in Danger! Ogopogo! to assist with our rank eight game plan. This is a valid choice although it tended towards bricking in my testing.  <strong>Dragon Spirit of White x 1</strong>  Now we look at another Blue-Eyes favourite Dragon Spirit of White. We play it here mostly as a fourth copy of Blue-Eyes White Dragon for the purpose of our search and draw spells. Aside from that its also useful with Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon’s stand-by phase effect as a banish of any spell or trap your opponent controls. We can also trigger the banish proactively with Return of the Dragon Lords should you need to. I didn’t find playing more than one necessary due to how searchable this is but two could be warranted in a more Blue-Eyes focused build.  <strong>Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn x 3</strong>  Finally we reach our normal summon of choice Raiden, the Hand of the Lightsworn. He’s well known these days due to a brief stint this year in the short-lived Lightsworn Eldlich as its normal summon of choice. We play him for much the same reason as he lets us mill a total of four cards over the course of a turn. We can use this to further our Chaos plays or set-up Blue-Eyes combos with the aforementioned Return of the Dragon Lords or Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon respectively. The fact that he’s a tuner also gives us a great followup line into Accesscode talker on the draw. I did briefly experiment with other starters like Mekk-Knight Orcust Girsu for lines into True King of all Calamities or the old Blue-Eyes staple Sage with Eyes of Blue but neither preformed as well as Raiden. If you dislike this choice feel free to try any other options you like.  <strong>The White Stone of Ancients x 2</strong>  Next up is another of our tuners: The White Stone of Ancients a favourite of the 2016 Blue-Eyes lists. In their lists this was played as the primary tuner for lines into Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon and as a search through its grave effect. In this build we play it more for the latter although there are Halqifibrax lines that can still make Spirit if necessary. We have a number of ways to get White Stone of Ancients in the grave — ideally we’ll be using Cards of Consonance but Foolish Burial or Melody of Awakening Dragon will do. I sacrificed playing three of these in favour of a single Master with Eyes of Blue for followup plays but if you’d prefer you can play the extra copy.  <strong>Master with Eyes of Blue x 1</strong>  As I mentioned above I sacrificed an extra copy of White Stone of Ancients in favour of this. Master with Eyes of Blue helps with unbricking certain niche hands and making Spirit Dragon or Accesscode Talker on the followup. This is aided by the same Foolish Burial and Melody of Awakening Dragon mentioned above. Once he’s in the grave we can make use of his effect or attribute for extending our plays, but my favourite is to resurrect him with Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians for an easy Accesscode Talker. This lets us close out games quickly but if you value the boosted consistency of an extra White Stone of Ancients go for it.  <strong>The White Stone of Legends x 1</strong>  Finally our last maindeck monster and tuner all-in-one The White Stone of Legends. It’s played for its ability to search a Blue-Eyes when it’s sent to the grave and its tuner status as its an alternate Halqifibrax target if we’ve banished both of our White Stone of Ancients. Like all the level one tuners we can also normal summon it and link it off for Linkuriboh or Relinquished Anima if we have no other way to get the search. You could definitely cut this but it would come at the price of less Foolish targets and searching.  <u><strong>Spells </strong></u>  &nbsp;  <strong>Return of the Dragon Lords x 2</strong>  We start off the spells and traps with Return of the Dragon Lords, essentially a tribal Monster Reborn for dragons. This allows us to convert a lot of the set-up Raiden provides into extension towards our rank eight payoff. It also has a secondary graveyard effect that can prevent our dragon monsters from being destroyed by battle or card effect. This is obviously relevant to any lines that end on Spirit Dragon or Draglubion/Hope Harbinger as it allows us to preserve their field presence and inherent negates for more ideal targets. Three of these tended to brick in testing although if you choose to play an increased Blue-Eyes package that will likely change.  <strong>Trade-</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>n x 3</strong>  Our first of several draw or search spells starting with the most ubiquitous. Trade-In is an iconic Blue-Eyes staple since its release in the Rise of the Dragon Lords Structure Deck as a common of all rarities. While it has a place in any rank eight strategy Trade-In is especially welcome here for setting up our Blue-Eyes and Chaos Dragon plays respectively. This is the reason I choose to play three here. Ideally we see it with Melody of Awakening Dragon for the maximum possible set-up. It would be pertinent to switch this up in-line with whatever your normal summon of choice is however I still think three copies is warranted for consistency.  <strong>Cards of Consonance x 1</strong>  Another draw spell and counter-point to Trade-In, Cards of Consonance is a powerful option for Blue-Eyes decks since its release in 2010. With that said you may be wondering why I’ve only chosen to play one, reason being due to a lack of targets. Since we’re playing a total of three targets one copy of Consonance is all we need due to how rarely it’ll be live in our opener. At<strong> 33%</strong> to open any one of our dragon tuners one is enough to ensure we can resolve it anytime we need it, however rare those might be. You could play One for One instead if you value the synchro lines over the XYZs lines but I find the synchro to be kind of underwhelming as a going first option compared to Draglubion.  <strong>The Melody of Awakening Dragon x 3</strong>  Now to look at our first of three search spells we play, The Melody of Awakening Dragon. Melody allows us to discard any card to search two dragons with 3000 or more attack and 2500 or less defence. This is of course Blue-Eyes White Dragon’s exact stat line for convenient access to Alternative and Dragon Spirit of White for example. As luck would have it we can also search Levianeer for followup hands requiring more than a single pop. The synergy is at a point where we can often go plus three or four off of a single copy plus discard. We play it at three because of this as the searching and setup are too good to pass up in my view.  <strong>Foolish Burial x 1</strong>  Another setup tool and one that I’m very fond of playing, Foolish Burial. Released in the same structure deck as Trade-In, Foolish Burial is powerful enough to be on the limited list at time of writing. For those who are new to the game Foolish Burial allows us to send one card from the deck to the graveyard, an effect so ubiquitous most players, myself included refer to any effect that sends monsters from deck to grave as a Foolish. We play Foolish here to do a number of things from assisting with setting up Blue-Eyes and Chaos Dragon plays to searching us fodder for Trade-In. If I had the chance to play more copies I would so bear that in mind for future builds.  <strong>Charge of the Light Brigade x 1</strong>  Next up is a powerful searcher for our normal summon that doubles as an explosive set-up piece in specific hands. Charge of the Light Brigade mills three from the top of the deck and adds a level four or lower Lightsworn monster from the deck to the hand. This allows us to mill a total of five cards if both this and Raiden go off uninterrupted which can produce some truly ridiculous combos depending on what you mill. Now astute readers might be wondering why I haven’t chose to prioritize this set-up combo by playing more copies of Charge instead of the three Raiden mentioned above. The reason is two-fold, firstly the number of handtraps being played even causally today makes it unlikely that both of Charge and Raiden will resolve. Secondly the extra copies of Raiden are useful for followup plays into Accesscode Talker whereas the extra copies of Charge of the Light Brigade are useless after the first turn. If you’d prefer more copies of Charge I would recommend switching focus away from Accesscode lines on the followup to something like Borrelsword and I:P Masquerena instead.  <strong>Chaos Space x 3</strong>  The last of our searchers and the newest by far, Chaos Space is a boon to all Chaos strategies. Released earlier this year in Toon Chaos, Chaos Space has featured in a number of top tier strategies including both versions of Dragon Link. This popularity is due to its incredibly versatile searching effect that allows us to discard a light or dark attribute monster in order to search a level four to eight monster with the opposite attribute from the deck. Beyond this when it’s in the graveyard Chaos Space allows us to banish it to target a banished light or dark monster that cannot be normal summoned or set before placing it on the bottom of the deck and drawing a card. The first effect can search almost any monster in the deck short the tuners with the correct discard while also setting up our Chaos plays with the discard and recurring our resources with the grave effect. It should be obvious at this point why we play three of these and personally I wouldn’t recommend cutting any regardless of the build.  <strong>Emergency Teleport x 1</strong>  Finally we’ll look at the last spell card, Emergency Teleport. Famously released in same set as Charge of the Light Brigade, The Duelist Genesis ushered in a new era for the established DAD Returns deck. TeleDAD would go on to define an entire format as one of the game’s most famous tier zero decks in Yu-Gi-Oh’s history. Emergency Teleport has seen widespread play long after the decline of DAD as a strategy in decks from Kozmo to Synchron Eldlich builds earlier this year. It’s mostly played these days as an extender for any deck trying to make Halqifibrax and this build is no different. Our target of choice is Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit both for its tuner status and light attribute which lets us set up our Chaos plays while also climbing into our synchros though Halqifibrax. In a spot it can even be an additional copy of Ogre if you’re desperate for interaction as her effect can be activated from the hand or field. Feel free to cut this in favour of something like Upstart Goblin if you value the consistency over extension.  <u><strong>Extra Deck</strong></u>  <strong>Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon x 1</strong>  We start our look at the extra deck with the first Blue-Eyes synchro monster Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon. Azure-Eyes has a couple of useful effects we’ll go over: firstly on the turn it’s summoned it prevents you and your opponent with targeting or destroying dragon monsters you control, and secondly it lets you summon a normal monster from your graveyard during your standby phase. The primary effect is obviously most useful when summoned off of Spirit Dragon during your opponent’s turn but it can also assist with OTKs in hands where you have your XYZs on the field already. The secondary effect can help with extension and popping spell or trap cards with a little setup. It all depends on what you have available in the grave — if you have a Dragon Spirit of White you’re good to pop a spell or trap, but if not the best option is a Blue-Eyes White Dragon for extension. You can absolutely cut this if you’d prefer to go deeper into the XYZs package but I like it for its ability to resolve niche hands with a single level eight.  <strong>Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon x 1</strong>  The second extra deck card we’ll be going over is the other notable Blue-Eyes synchro Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon. I’ve gone over his effects at length but briefly for those of you skim reading: he stops anyone summoning more than 2 monsters at once plus he can negate any effect that activates in the graveyard once per turn. His last effect lets us tag him out for any light Dragon extra deck monster, normally that’ll be Azure-Eyes but we play another target in Black Rose Moonlight Dragon. Which of these you choose depends entirely on what sort of board state you’re facing but I’ll go more into detail about the use cases of each target in their respective entries. You can cut this and the entire synchro package if you’d like but you’ll want to update the maindeck to include more rank eight support at that point.  <strong>Cloudcastle x 1</strong>  Our third synchro is here purely for True King of All Calamities setups on the followup. Cloudcastle is slated to get a little more popular with the release of the Virtual World archetype two days ago at time of writing. I suspect it’ll be popular there for much the same reason it is here; it allows for simple True King set-ups on the followup using spent level nine synchros like Spirit Dragon or Azure-Eyes. Its on field effect actively works against our strategy so I’d recommend only going into Cloudcastle when you have access to another level nine in grave. You can remove this but I wouldn’t recommend it as True King of All Calamities is a significant part of our game plan.  <strong>Black Rose Moonlight Dragon x 1</strong>  The final synchro monster and the second Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon target is Black Rose Moonlight Dragon. We play Black Rose as a monster negate accessible by our synchro line so as to not be left without interaction on some niche hands. We have no way to summon this normally so I wouldn’t recommend relying on this without Spirit Dragon access or alterations to the main deck. Feel free to take this out for another Spirit Dragon target or a larger XYZs package.  <strong>True King of All Calamities x 1</strong>  The first of our XYZs is also the most well-known and oppressive card in the deck. True King of All Calamities has been the gold standard of floodgate monsters since its release in 2017 in Maximum Crisis. As I mentioned above we summon him through followup lines specifically involving Cloudcastle and a spent Spirit Dragon or Azure-Eyes in grave. As a followup play True King is incredible; if your opponent’s board is already simplified by various pops and negates, True King of All Calamities will stop them from coming back altogether. It’s 3000 attack is also notable as a way to close out games, given that every extender in the deck has at least 2500 attack. I wouldn’t recommend cutting this as it’s our most powerful followup, but if you dislike floodgates then more Blue-Eyes extra deck support could be an option.  <strong>Number 92: Heart EartH Dragon x 1</strong>  Next up is our first Draglubion target Heart EartH Dragon, a situational but powerful option against decks lacking in non-destruction removal. Its first effect prevents it from being destroyed by battle while dealing all battle damage you would have taken to your opponent. Its second effect allows it to resurrect on destruction providing you have material with the added bonus of it gaining 1000 attack for every banished monster on re-summon. This together can make it hard for decks without highly specific tech or non-destruction removal to out this card before we run it into their most powerful monster for big damage. You could remove this in favour of another relevant Draglubion target but I’ve found this to be unexpected and powerful in casual play.  <strong>Number 97: Draglubion x 1</strong>  Finally onto the card that ties our XYZs package together and allows us to cheat out a variety of targets, Number 97: Draglubion. For those unfamiliar Draglubion’s effect allows one to detach a material to summon any Dragon-type Number monster from the extra deck by attaching another one from the extra deck to it. This is the core of our best lines as we can turn any two level eight extenders into 9000 damage going second or a negate going first. Aside from this Draglubion also cannot be targeted with card effects which can help in keeping it alive for followup plays. Not much more to say on this one as I’ve gone into greater detail in the entries for the targets above and below. I wouldn't recommend cutting this as it ties the extra deck together but there are a huge number of targets for its effect that you could test.  <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy x 1</strong>  The second to last XYZs and Draglubion target that we’ll be looking at is Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy. The name is quite a mouthful so I’ll be referring to him as Hope Harbinger for the sake of my editor. Hope Harbinger’s effect is a combination of synergistic negation and powerful floating that compliments our first turn end boards nicely. Its first effect is a standard spell or effect negate that attaches the negated card to it as material while its second effect allows us to redirect attacks to it by detaching a material. This can be useful for keeping our other XYZs alive or preventing any OTKs. On the chance that an XYZs is destroyed while it’s on the field Hope Harbinger allows us to give attack equal to one of the destroyed monsters to itself or any other XYZs you control. This helps to facilitate OTKs on the followup as the attack gain is permanent. I wouldn’t recommend cutting this as it’s another of this build’s powerful going first options, but if you do decide to cut it I’d recommend another negate to replace it.  <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon x 1</strong>  Our last XYZs and Draglubion target is Number 100: Numeron Dragon, the largest beat-stick in the build. We summon this with Draglubion’s effect like the rest, however unlike the rest this tends to end games in one swing. When on the draw one only has to summon this with the above effect before detaching its one and only material to have it gain attack equal to the combined ranks of all XYZs monsters on the field times 1000. Assuming itself and Draglubion are the only monsters on the field this will result in 9000 attack for Numeron Dragon, which providing you’ve chipped in over prior turns should result in a win. This makes up the majority of followup plays from boards where Draglubion survives to your second turn and your opponent has left something in attack position. Worse for them if they happen to have an XYZs monster on the field as that will result in even higher attack for Numeron Dragon. I wouldn’t cut this if you value the ability to close games quickly, however if you’d prefer to favour the next monster removing it could be an option.  <strong>Accesscode Talker x 1</strong>  Next up is last stop of our link climb and second OTK enabler Accesscode Talker. My readers will probably recognize Accesscode as he was released earlier this year in Eternity Code and has been played in anything capable of making a link four. We climb into Accesscode in a typical line involving Halqifibrax and Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians aided by our single copy of Master with Eyes of Blue in grave. This will give us a 5300 attack monster and one to two banishes from the field to resolve whatever board our opponent has. Feel free to remove this combo and payoff — I favoured it because of going second hands that lack a second level eight extender but that's only relevant in this build specifically.  <strong>Selene, Queen of the Master magicians x 1</strong>  Next up is Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians, the third stop on our link-climb to Accesscode Talker. A good link monster in her own right, Selene is played mostly for her effect. On summon she gains spell counters equal to the number of spell cards in both graveyards and on the field which can be removed three at a time to summon any spellcaster type from your hand or graveyard. This is always Master with Eyes of Blue in this build but if you replaced Ghost Ogre with Effect Veiler you’ll have more targets on average. From the summon of our spellcaster from hand or grave we link Selene off with it for Accesscode, enabling our alternative OTK line. If you cut Accesscode obviously cut this in favour of something more synergistic with your build.  <strong>Crystron Halqifibrax x 1</strong>  I really hope all my readers understand why we play this next link monster, Crystron Halqifibrax. At time of writing Halqifibrax has been at large in the TCG for eight months since its release in Duel Overload, enabling all sorts of combos. In this build it enables the above mentioned Accesscode combo along with a few synchro lines in hands with at least two extenders. Normally you’ll want to summon the one copy of The White Stone of Legend off of Halqifibrax’s effect, although The White Stone of Ancients is acceptable in a pinch. Both can be linked off for one of a couple options we’ll go over shortly to get their searches off should you need them. As with the other links we’ve been over this can be cut if you don’t favour the Accesscode lines; alternatively one could emphasize this option with the addition of Linkross and Martial Metal Marcher for better synchro payoffs.  <strong>Heiratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres x 1 </strong>  Our last link two is a favourite of many modern Dragon-tribal lists such as Dragon Link. Heiratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres is probably the most generally playable of all the Heiratic archetype as it allows us to cheat out our Dragon Spirit of White while bouncing a card from our opponent’s field. This can be enough to stall out an opponent’s turn long enough for one to draw into one of this build’s two OTK lines. I tested replacing this with I:P Masquerana but that often lost me games even with proper targets instead of the Accesscode climb. As a result I would recommend keeping this in the build regardless of what changes you make as until Blue-Eyes gets a link two of their own, this will be the best option.  <strong>Linkuriboh x 1</strong>  Time for the second to last link monster now, Linkuriboh is one of the best generic link ones out there. Many of you will be familiar with this one and its uses as it has been played in a variety of strategies thanks to its ability to convert tokens into link fuel. We play it here as a corner case for getting our level one tuners in the grave if we have no extenders or alternative normal summons. This doesn’t come up often mind, as we have a<strong> 76%</strong> chance to open at least one extender, but I still value this pick. You can cut this if you want to move away from the synchro lines with your build as another target for Draglubion would be better in that case.  <strong>Relinquished Anima x 1</strong>  Finally we reach the last extra deck monster, Relinquished Anima: a link one that doubles as a removal spell in specific cases. Like the other extra deck Relinquished monsters Anima can equip one face-up monster to itself, providing it’s pointing to that monster. In practise this means that any player careless enough to leave a monster face up in front of either extra monster zone can be punished with Anima and any of our level one tuners. Like Linkuriboh above, this also assists in getting our level one tuners in the graveyard for their effects or for a Chaos Dragon play. I wouldn’t cut this from any list with level ones as it can be an amazing boon if your opponent forgets or doesn't know to play around it. <ol start=""2"">  	<li><strong>Sidedeck and Tech Choices: </strong><strong>The Casual Dilemma </strong></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <u><strong>Handtraps and the Side Deck</strong></u>  &nbsp;  <strong>Notes on the Side Deck</strong>  Before I get started I’d like to explain my choices around the side deck and the handtraps I’ve elected to include in the main deck. This deck was built for a couple smaller tournaments that I predicted would have a slower meta compared to the current competitive scene. This proved to be the correct call for the tournaments I was in but I would caution against the same side deck for competitive play. That aside the reason I decided to maindeck Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit was mostly due to it being live more often than PSY-Framegear Gamma and it not taking up another maindeck slot with PSY-Frame Driver. If you’d prefer Gamma it doesn't alter much of the deck beyond finding a slot for Driver so go for it if you need a more competitive option. One last thing of note before I go over Ghost Ogre is my inclusion of Dante, Pilgrim of the Burning Abyss. He’s here as an optional punish for Dogmatika strategies running Maximus as when he’s sent off of an opponent’s Maximus he rips a card from their hand. I find this funny and worth playing in a casual setting but if you’d prefer N’Tss that is a better option.  &nbsp;  <strong>Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit x 3</strong>  Now to look at our only main deck handtrap Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit. I’ve already gone over a lot of why we play it above so here I’ll go over its synergies with the rest of our build. Chief among the synergy is the aforementioned Emergency Teleport allowing us to summon one of these anytime we can can fire off a quick-play spell. This will allows us to get more interaction if needed or more commonly to extend into Halqifibrax on the followup for Accesscode Talker. If you prefer Ash Blossom or any of the other popular handtraps you can switch this out for them, although in that case you’d be better switching Emergency Teleport for Upstart Goblin or another consistency booster. <ol start=""3"">  	<li><strong>Combo Guide: </strong><strong>The Real Return of the Dragon Lords</strong></li> </ol> Time now to look at some of the deck’s combos going first along with some notes on potential followup plays. I’ve chosen to include three of the more common openers to hopefully illustrate how the deck performs on average along with some data to show how often one can expect them. One of the deck’s strongest suits is its flexibility while playing through a couple interruptions going first or second so I’ll try to highlight this where possible. <ol>  	<li><strong>Any Level 8 Extender Plus Level 1 Tuner </strong></li> </ol> Starting off with a classic opener of Blue-Eyes decks, this opener will leave us with a Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon and the ability to tag out into Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon for its protection effect. This hand can take several forms with a<strong> 22% </strong>chance to open any variant of it. The most optimal is a hand of Blue-Eyes Alternative and White Dragons plus The White Stone of Legend. To start we’ll summon our level eight of choice — say Alternative White Dragon in this case but any of the Dangers work too. From there we’ll normal summon our White Stone of Ancients and then synchro summon Blue Eyes Spirit Dragon. If we have a couple extra extenders Hope Harbinger or Draglubion can be good additions to increase the stickiness of your board. A followup from here can be as simple as going into True King of All Calamities with the aid of Cloudcastle, or detaching your other material from Draglubion to summon Number 100: Numeron Dragon for a swift OTK. This alone is the weakest of our openings but with the addition of other interaction it can still close out games.  &nbsp; <ol start=""2"">  	<li><strong>2</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon plus Blue-Eyes White Dragon and a Danger! Monster</strong></li> </ol> Next up a slightly more common opening at <strong>40% </strong>to open going first and <strong>50%</strong> going second. This play ends on boards of our rank eight XYZs package — normally Draglubion and Hope Harbinger going first, or Draglubion and Numeron Dragon going second. This represents a negate and Towers-ish effect in Draglubion’s first effect going first or 9000 damage on board for a quick OTK. All the followups I recommend from here involve using Draglubion’s effect again either for the above-mentioned damage line or Heart-eartH Dragon for stickier boards. This opening is normally enough to close out games against the build’s intended targets but if you have the option combining this with any of the other lines mentioned here it’ll result in exponentially stronger boards.  &nbsp; <ol start=""3"">  	<li><strong>3</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Raiden plus any extender; going second </strong></li> </ol> The final line we’ll be looking at is our alternate OTK line going second, although this can double as a followup effectively. All you’ll need is Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn and a monster you can special summon like any of our Danger! monsters. At<strong> 31%</strong> to open this going first and <strong>40%</strong> going second this hand is hardly rare but exceptionally powerful. To start we’ll normal summon Raiden, remembering to mill two with his effect before special summoning our extender and linking both off for Halqifibrax. We’ll then use Halqifibrax’s effect to special summon Master with Eyes of Blue providing we didn’t mill it off of Raiden’s effect. This will allow us to link both of them off for Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians before using her effect to summon back Master with Eyes of Blue and linking both of them off for Accesscode Talker. From here you’ll have a 5300 attack monster and two banishes from the field with which to close out the game. There’s normally no need to followup from this point but if you find yourself not winning from here I’d recommend a rank eight play or anything that’ll put more damage on board.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <ol start=""4"">  	<li><strong> Final Thoughts</strong></li> </ol> &nbsp;  Finally we reach the end of this guide, I appreciate all of you who took the time to read this. If you enjoyed this or found it helpful why not leave a like or comment? I try to put out one of these every couple weeks so if you’d like me to cover a specific deck or archetype let me know in the comments below or on Discord @CryptidYgo#6296. I’ll also take a minute to plug my Discord server The Yu-Gi-Oh Writers Guild. We’re a community of Yu-Gi-Oh content creators who provide help and feedback as well as opportunities for self promotion. At the end of this week on November 15th we’ll be hosting the first in a series of four free-to-enter tournaments, The Winter Revel. If you’d like to learn more about this or the Discord check us out <a>here</a>.  As for my final thoughts on the deck I have to say I was surprised by how much fun I had with this list. I haven’t tried to hide that this is a casual list for casual play but despite that this list exceeded my expectations. The combo of Draglubion plus Hope Harbinger wound up being too much for many rogue tier and below decks due to how consistent it is. While I don’t think this list would hold up competitively in today’s meta I was surprised how much fun Yu-Gi-Oh can still be. Despite all the Halq-Kross combos and nine negate set-ups going first that plague the current meta it is still possible to have fun playing Yu-Gi-Oh at any level. If like me you’re feeling a tad burned out by the grind of meta play I would highly recommend returning to a more casual environment with a deck like this. That’s going to be it from me but until next time stay safe and have fun.  &nbsp;"

So here it is, in all of it's degenerate glory. (Yes it runs Mystic Mine, don't whine about degeneracy in the comments, just run Cosmic Cyclone bro) Deck list 3x Stained Greaves- can chain onto a Boots to make a Bardiche, and can  special summon a monster from the Grave. great card 3x Ragged Gloves- pretty good starter that can buff a Break Sword to make ranking it up into Zeus easier, and can search a Boots, albeit through a complicated matter that Ash or Lock Bird adores to negate. 3x Anchient Cloak- Can be a shitty garnet but, I run at 3 because of how good it's search it. Can be a simple normal summon to use Boots or Kage on though, if you're in a tight spot 3x Torn Scales- Graveyard setup galore, which leads to searching more Boots and Fog Blades. 1x Snake boy- can't spell the name but, he's a good boy which leads to a free monster and either a draw or GY setup, or both. great card 1x Jackalope- see above 3x Kagemucha- leads to much easier XYZ in brickier hands, if you dont have a boots or something like it 3x Mystic Mine- seriously slows down the opponent and the game in general to a level that this deck likes, and then gets eradicated by Zeus 1x Terraforming- searches mystic mine lol 3x Fog Blade- easily stuns an opponent's big monster if you dont have a Mystic or if your Mystic's been eradicated. 3x Sword- Buffs your Bardiche if you leave it on the field, because im really paranoid about Bardiche being run over. 3x Mist Claws- recovers the banished PK's, to make more XYZ after you use their searches and shit that they banish themselves for 3x Fiendish Chain- does the same thing as Fog Blade 3x Trap Trick- searches a lot of your good trap's like Fog Blade that you need 3x Metaverse- same thing as Terra, just worse Extra deck list 3x Break Sword- the first monster you want to make so you can destroy cards and attack to rank up into Zeus 3x Dante- 2nd in command if all Break Sword copies are gone 3x Leviar- Good for late game recovery of resources 3x Zeus- The boss monster, really- rank it up from Break Sword and wreak havoc. 1x Bardiche- Nice option if you have a ton of dark monsters on the field and can afford to make one 1x Megaclops- good for grindier, slower games, where you might make 3 XYZ. very situational though 1x Knightmare Gryphon- good resource recovery late game Playing guide Like the original PK build I made, this isn't super complex or anything. You set up a strong backrow and Mystic Mine and then start building up an XYZ by getting out enough monsters with effects like Kage and Boots, overlay into Break Sword. Then you use Break Sword's effect to set up your graveyard and pop one of your backrows to pop the opponent's boss monster (if possible). Then you go into the battle phase, and attack with what should be a 3k Break Sword if you got Glove's boost. Afterwards, go into Main Phase 2 and rank up into Zeus. Then you wait for the opponent's turn, wipe everything they work for. Go into your turn, make more XYZ, set up more backrow if possible (don't set up another Mystic Mine, you want to just use it in the first time to slow the opponent), then wittle them down little by little as you basically Evenly Matched them with Zeus, until you eventually finish them off. (Note: Go second for this, and if your Zeus rank up gets negated/destroyed, stall the opponent with Mine and Fog Blade and Chain until you can make another Zeus, then go about the strategy i entailed above. Also, if your opponent is running heavy Mystic Mine hate, I reccomend siding it in favor of Pot of Desires and that one floodgate trap that  makes it so you cant activate spells.) Like normal, any suggestions are appeciated. Have a good day. Also, fun fact: A dude tried to fuse my Bardiche while I was in the middle of my effect when I was play testing this, then started spamming slurs when I said he couldn't do that"

Linkuribohs are good for <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, it's also good to have 2, because then you can link <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> and draw a card with its effect for example when you have 3 token's with the same name with <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>.  &nbsp;  Spells:  <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, <a data-name=""Amazoness Call"">Amazoness Call</a>, <a data-name=""Link Burst"">Link Burst</a>, <a data-name=""Pot Of Disparity"">Pot Of Disparity</a> - The draw engine, it is dependent on stalling cards which is why there are defensive spell and trap cards together with the Amazoness Cards, <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a> gets triggered when any monster or Token gets destroyed by battle or card effects, but only once per turn, so you don't want more than one monster to get destroyed per turn if it's possible. <a data-name=""Pot Of Disparity"">Pot Of Disparity</a> is better than <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>, because then you can use the Link monsters more effectively, if you banish cards you can banish the backup-cards, 1 <a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>, <a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a> because it needs 2 different names as monsters, <a data-name=""Soul of Silvermountain"">Soul of Silvermountain</a>, <a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys"">Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys</a> and <a data-name=""Ascension Sky Dragon"">Ascension Sky Dragon</a>  <a data-name=""Amazoness Village"">Amazoness Village</a>, <a data-name=""Scapegoat"">Scapegoat</a>, <a data-name=""Swords of Revealing Light"">Swords of Revealing Light</a>, <a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>, <a data-name=""My Body as a Shield"">My Body As A Shield</a>, <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> - Strong defensive cards to get tokens and to support the Amazoness-engine and the Draw-engine.  &nbsp;  Traps:  <a data-name=""Statue of Anguish Pattern"">Statue of Anguish Pattern, </a><a data-name=""Shapesister"">Shapesister</a> - A defensive card that maybe triggers <a data-name=""Supply Squad"">Supply Squad</a>, it is a Rock-card, so you can also special summon <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> with it. With <a data-name=""Pot of Disparity"">Pot of Disparity</a> <a data-name=""Shapesister"">Shapesister</a> is a great card, this way you can get a fast <a data-name=""Stardust Dragon"">Stardust Dragon</a> or <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> for more negations as a support, it also can maybe trigger the destroy-effect of <a data-name=""Statue of Anguish Pattern"">Statue of Anguish Pattern</a>.  <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> - If you special summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Princess"">Amazoness Princess</a> with it you can search for another Amazoness card from the deck, and if you summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>, your Amazoness-monster-cards get undestroyable.  <a data-name=""Amazoness Onslaught"">Amazoness Onslaught</a>- The strongest trap card, because you can banish every monster you attack with Amazoness cards, works best with undestroyable Amazones-monster-cards with <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a>. You can also summon <a data-name=""Amazoness Queen"">Amazoness Queen</a> or other Amazoness-monster-cards from the hand with it.  <a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>, <a data-name=""Graveyard of wandering souls"">Graveyard of wandering souls</a>, <a data-name=""Storming Mirror Force"">Storming Mirror Force</a> - Supportive Trap cards that support the token-engine and also the draw-engine with <a data-name=""Graveyard of wandering souls"">Graveyard of wandering souls</a>."

This deck has several different ways to get to its end board, so there is no one specific combo to get there. But I'll try to explain the kind of route you'd want to take. <ul>  	<li>In most cases you want to try to get Striker Dragon out as soon as possible with Rokket Tracer either in hand or GY, the preferred way to do this is by using Chaos Space or Quick Launch.</li>  	<li>Search Boot Sector Launch with Striker Dragon, and if Tracer is in the GY use Strikers effect to get Tracer to the hand.</li>  	<li>Use Boot Sector Launch to special summon Tracer. Then you can use Tracer together with any extender to go into Halqifibrax, then use Halqifibrax's effect to summon out Plaguespreader Zombie.</li>  	<li>Link Halqifibrax into Linkross and summon 2 tokens with it's effect. Then synchro summon Martial Metal Marcher using Plague spreader and one of the tokens. You can use Martial's effect to summon Tracer back out again. With this you already have the setup for Herald of the Arc Light and have a lv4 tuner ready for Borreload Savage Dragon.</li> </ul> From this point it's all dependend on which extenders you opened with or were able to get throughout making combo's.  If you have Necroworld Banshee in the graveyard or Zombie World in hand, you could revive Plaguespreader through his effect, activate Zombie World and use Plaguespreader and Linkross to go into Union Carrier for the Dragon Buster.  When you get stuck but you are able to go into a lv8 synchro there is the possibility to go into Chaos Ruler to mill some cards and get a new card in hand. It's risky but can help you out, additionally Chaos Ruler can be used as an extender through his floating effect.  I know it's not really the most helpful explaination but I hope you'll get the basic gist of this deck and have fun playing around with it."

First step is to get Curse Necrofear into the graveyard, there are multiple ways to do this:  1. Summon Tour Guide From the Underworld &amp; use her effect to summon Fiendish Rhino Warrior, go into Link or XYZ play &amp; send Fiendish Rhino Warrior to the graveyard &amp; use his effeck to send Curse Necrofear to the graveyard, you can also send one of the Drak Spirit's there if you use Cherubini.  2. Use Foolish Burial to send Fiendish Rhino Warrior the the graveyard &amp; then use his effect to send Curse Necrofear there.  3. Use Trade in to send Curse Necrofear to the graveyard.  Dark Sanctuary &amp; Battle Fader are the deck's stall cards, after you summon Battle Fader, if you have Destiny Board/Spirit Message's &amp; Sentence of Doom set up, get rid of it &amp; use Sentance of Doom's effect to return it. Terraforming &amp; Metaverse will help you get it.  Even if Destiny Board gets destroyed you can use Dark Spirit's Mastery's graveyard effect to send them back to the Deck &amp; draw more cards potentially going +4 also &amp; it's probably better your opponent waste's their resources trying to stop Destiny Board, it you do manage to get Destiny Board &amp; 3 of the other Spirit messages use Sentence of Doom to place the last one &amp; win the Duel.  Finally there's Curse Necrofear &amp; Dark Necrofear, use the Dark Spirits effects to summon Curse Necrofear from the graveyard &amp; preferably get it destroyed if you have face up spell &amp; trap cards at the end of the turn it will return potentially destroy up to 5 of the opponents cards. Dark Necrofear needs to be summoned properly first by banishing 3 fiend type monsters, but you should have no trouble getting fiend type monsters into the graveyard &amp; you can use Sentence of Doom or Curse Necrofear summoning condition to retrieve them. if both of them get destroyed on the same you can take control of on of the opponent's monsters and destroy a card on their field since Dark Necrofear counts as a spell when equipped to an opponent's monster. When either of them get destroyed use the Dark Spirit's graveyard effects to add the to your hand allowing you to summon them again."

I have ran 3 before, I decided I prefer them at 2.  It opens up <em>more plays</em> for me and makes space for my extremely important backrow removal.  MST is a great spell. It's a quick spell with no costs, and has a classic feeling. Twin Twisters require discarding, and Cosmic Cyclone requires you to pay 1000 LP to banish. The discarding effect is great, it puts things in my graveyard, but I need a hand to play with. I don't run more than 1 TT. and I haven't come across a spell/trap that I so badly needed to banish. Destroying it is enough. Presumably there won't be another turn for your opponent to use the effect of whatever spell/trap you destroyed.  I main deck Sphere Mode of Ra, Kaiju, and Zoo King Alpha because, why not? why should I have to lose game 1 to bring them in for game 2? Why can't I win game 1 with the help of Kaiju? Why must I lose that first game to Dragun, Infinity, Borreload and Apollousa? or to UCT, Laggia, VFD and Wind Barrier Statue?  I don't have to. I can run whatever removal I need in my main deck. I don't need a whole entire 40 card archetype in my deck. I only need about 18 - 20 Lunalight cards,  10 utility cards, and the other stuff can be anything. I prefer backrow removal and things to deal with monsters. You bait an effect here, bait an effect there, Kaiju this, negate that, and proceed with your play.  &nbsp;  Now that that's out the way, onto the strategy :  I prefer to search Tenki via Tiger King's effect. Tiger King is good for 2 reasons :  1 . Searches your Beast-Warriors.  2 . Negates the effects of all non Beast-Warriors.  In other words, your opponent will be forced to negate if they want to protect their monsters.  You <em>can</em> OTK without normal summoning, it is possible and I have done it. It's why I main deck Sphere Mode of Ra.  I don't <em>need</em> that normal summon to pull it off. and then Tiger King will just negate Sphere Mode, so you can attack it for game.  <em>**Dark World Dealings triggers your Lunalight monster's effects.</em>  Do NOT use Lunalight Fusion as your main fusion card.  Lunalight Fusion uses a MATERIAL from the DECK, use it to SETUP your GRAVEYARD.  Do NOT miss out on a play because you used Lunalight Fusion to summon Sabre Dancer.  Lunalight Fusion triggers the effects of your Lunalight monsters. So send Emerald Bird from your deck to activate her effect to summon one Lunalight (only Kaleido Chick is worth this summon) from the graveyard or banished zone.  Or use it to send Yellow Marten to activate her effect to add a Lunalight trap from your deck to your hand.  This trap can be discarded a million different ways.  <em>**Psst, The only way you should be fusion summoning is through Wolf.</em>  Why Wolf? Because Wolf BANISHES your KALEIDO CHICK, which has an effect that ACTIVATES when she is BANISHED.  This effect reads :<em> "" If this card is banished: You can activate this effect; this turn, your opponent's cards and effects cannot be activated during the Battle Phase.""</em>  <em>*Drops the mic*</em>  <em>*And his Diet Coke*</em>  Only go for game if you banish Kaleido Chick, otherwise don't risk attacking. It's a One Turn Kill. Not Dogmatika Invoked Shaddoll.  Go for the One Turn Kill <em><span><span>if and only if</span></span></em> you banish Kaleido Chick.  Thy Goal : To get Leo out as soon as possible AND secure the OTK.  Steps To Achieve Thy Goal :  1 . Protect yourself first. Use the Kaijus and Droplets to protect yourself from getting negated. This deck can bait and deal with negates pretty well, but realistically no one is surviving 7 interruptions. USE the mf'ing Kaijus and Zoo King Alpha and Sphere Mode to protect yourself from threats.  2 . Get Kaleido Chick in Hand, Field and/or Graveyard ASAP. The more the merrier.  3 . Get Wolf in Hand or Graveyard (Field is OK too but you will need to use Yellow Marten to put him back in your hand. Least optimal scenario)  4 . Have some way to Special Summon Blue Cat, either from Hand or from Graveyard. Blue Cat will double Leo's original attack.  5 .

""Flamvell"" and its sub-archetypal ""Neo-Flamvell"" are a completely Fire-based group that almost exclusively consists out of monsters. The archetype is often seen as the alpha version of ""Laval"", who just so happened to be able to use their main playmaker in form of ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" as much as ""Flamvell"" could. Strategy-wise, the monsters feature a mix of Special Summoning, burn damage and beatdown-/battle-focussed effects, but the overall age of the archetype(s) is clear for anyone to see. ""Flamvells"" was one of the first archetypes to receive Synchro monsters, showcasing how old the archetype actually is, and the loose group of members really does not have that many similar factors and strategies to work with in unison. Nonetheless, I tried to build something with them and I feel like the deck at least tries to make the best out of what the archetype has to offer.</p> <p>One cannot talk about ""Flamvell"" without mentioning ""<a data-name=""Flamvell Firedog"">Flamvell Firedog</a>"". This 1900 ATK critter can summon monsters from the deck if it manages to destroy something in battle, which is rather mediocre from a modern standpoint but really one of the best cards the archetype has to offer. Together with the other key card in the deck, ""<a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a>"", you can actually manage to summon Synchro and Link monsters in turn one, despite the fact that ""Flamvells"" are terribly slow. ""<a data-name=""Red Resonator"">Red Resonator</a>"" also has the huge benefit of having 200 DEF and therefore being revivable via ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"", and as an added bonus it even heals your life points when Special summoned, giving the deck an odd amount of survivability in certain situations. ""<a data-name=""Neo-Flamvell Lady"">Neo-Flamvell Lady</a>"" is the newest support card and brings disruption and graveyard setup, both well received in the archetype. The single copy of ""<a data-name=""Flamvell Archer"">Flamvell Archer</a>"" serves both as a Level 3 Tuner monster, as well as a potential ATK boost after a ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" play. The last archetypal monster in the Main Deck is ""<a data-name=""Neo-Flamvell Origin"">Neo-Flamvell Origin</a>"", who can technically serve as further swarming, just in a fairly limited amount of scenarios.</p> <p>This alone does not make the deck though: I added two copies of ""<a data-name=""Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner"">Cataclysmic Scorching Sunburner</a>"" and two copies ""<a data-name=""Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag"">Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag</a>"" to the deck; the first one provides a small amount of burn damage while being a sizeable beatstick that can summon itself when you lose resources, while ""<a data-name=""Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag"">Gizmek Kaku, the Supreme Shining Stag</a>"" is a big beater that can enter the field rather easily by getting rid of opposing Extra Deck monsters. The two copies of ""<a data-name=""Volcanic Shell"">Volcanic Shell</a>"" are just there to be ditched via ""<a data-name=""Neo-Flamvell Lady"">Neo-Flamvell Lady</a>"", but they do provide further deck thinning and a card to discard if necessary. Lastly, the ""<a data-name=""Guerilla Kite"">Guerilla Kite</a>"" might seem odd, but it is one of the few Level 4 Fire Tuners in the game, has more attack than ""<a data-name=""Flamvell Magician"">Flamvell Magician</a>"", the necessary 200 DEF for ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" revives and a small burn damage to edge you closer to OTKable life point numbers.</p> <p>The backrow consists entirely of Spell cards in order to make the deck run smoother and faster. Three copies of ""<a data-name=""Resonator Call"">Resonator Call</a>"" are there to make sure that you can pull the summoning of two monsters turn one off, two ""<a data-name=""Pot of Desires"">Pot of Desires</a>"" and one ""<a data-name=""Pot of Avarice"">Pot of Avarice</a>"" are reasonably priced draw options, ""<a data-name=""Reasoning"">Reasoning</a>"" is another swarming tool, ""<a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a>"" can fetch stuff back for attacks and Extra Deck summons, while ""<a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" all destroy opposing cards that you might struggle with. The main star of the show are the three copies of ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"", which can turn the deck from a weak pile of cards into an actual thread, either by kicking for enough damage to allow for an OTK or by using the summoned monsters for various Extra Deck shenanigans to gain board control that way. To allow ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" to work at full potential, there are also options like ""<a data-name=""Slash Draw"">Slash Draw</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Card Destruction"">Card Destruction</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Performapal Popperup"">Performapal Popperup</a>"" which all fill the graveyard with revivable monster cards.</p> <p>The Extra Deck features a number of options to either get rid of certain threats on the opposing side of the field or to support the Extra Deck summon chain after the successful ""<a data-name=""Rekindling"">Rekindling</a>"" play. For the former there are ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Salamangreat Heatleo"">Salamangreat Heatleo</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier"">Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"", all taking care of certain threats that might come up. For the swarming, there are three copies of ""<a data-name=""Duelittle Chimera"">Duelittle Chimera</a>"", which I previously ran at a lower copy count but I found that summoning all three is actually possible and sometimes even very helpful. ""<a data-name=""Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze"">Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a>"" can transform pretty much any monster into more helpful option, while the new ""<a data-name=""Infernity Doom Archfiend"">Infernity Doom Archfiend</a>"" can become a pretty solid beater/destruction option if you play your cards right.</p> <p>It has to be said that this is not a competitively viable deck as ""Flamvell"" is a rather lackluster archetype; in fact, I would say that they do not get even close to anything meta-related in terms of power level or consistency. However, for Casual rounds this deck should perform just fine and it was in all honesty the maximum I thought there was to get out of the archetype without simply throwing lots of money cards at it. If you are interested in the archetype and might even want to try giving your own ""Flamvell"" deck a spin, I invite you to look at my ""Flamvell"" analysis on my blog here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/03/archetype-analysis-neo-flamvell/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/10/03/archetype-analysis-neo-flamvell/</a></p>"

Hide-and-Seek, other than being Melffys favorite game, allows you to save your beast monsters from being destroyed by card effects the first time each turn. It also allows you to shuffle three beasts with different names into your deck from your GY and draw a card. <strong>Melffy of the Forest</strong> lets you search cards, but also allows you to cancel the effects of a summoned monster once per turn if it activates a Melffy's ability to go back to your hand. This is why you should always have at least one Melffy monster out at all times. (which is VERY easy to do!)  &nbsp;  The Melffys!:  You pretty much always want to have <strong>Melffy Puppy</strong> out. This lets you grab <strong>Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest, </strong>activating its ability to destroy a card on the field.  <strong>Melffy Catty</strong> lets you search cards you need to add to your hand. This very useful to grab a <strong>Rescue Cat</strong> or the Boss, <strong>Alpacaribou, Mystical Beast of the Forest.</strong>  <strong>Melffy Fenny</strong> lets you summon from your hand completing the combo to get out <strong>Alpacaribou</strong> or any other monster stuck in your hand.  <strong>Melffy Pony</strong> and <strong>Melffy Rabbi</strong> are mostly just fuel for <strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> or Xyz.  <strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> is interesting and can be utilized really well for direct damage, a wall or <strong>Melffy Playhouse</strong>.  &nbsp;  ...and Friends!:  <strong>Naturia Beast</strong> is what you will mostly use <strong>Rescue Cat</strong> for summoning <strong>Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest</strong> and either <strong>Mine Mole</strong> or <strong>Crusadia Leonis</strong> to syncro for <strong>Naturia Beast</strong> in one turn.  <strong>Nimble Beaver</strong> helps you get out your Xyz and I have subbed them for <strong>Amazoness Pet Baby Tiger</strong> which works better for <strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> (and keeps everyone EARTH)  <strong>Missus Radiant</strong> is your go to for Link summoning. The attack boost is a huge help and with the help of <strong>Scapegoat</strong> you can summon both at once for little effort!  <strong>Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu</strong> is a big help against foes with a lot attack power. It's tokens can fight the toughest boss monsters and with the help of <strong>Missus Radiant</strong>, <strong>Closed Forest</strong>, or <strong>Ayers rock Sunrise</strong> you can overtake them easily!  <strong>Melffy Mommy</strong> has a huge pocket that works sort of like a bag of holding. She likes to turn it inside out for a <strong>Dark Hole</strong> magic attack that, if <strong>Melffy Hide-and-Seek</strong> is active, only gets rid of your opponents monsters!  <strong>Aussa the Earth Charmer, Immovable</strong> likes to wander into the forest every once in awhile, but mostly to chase random creatures around for fun  &nbsp;  I hope I covered everything! This deck is all about getting cards on and off the field and being cute and having fun! Though sometimes you need some protecting from the guardians of the forest.  NOTE: I just got <strong>Joyous Melffys</strong> and I haven't played with it yet, but wanted it in there anyway"

At its core, we summon high attack level 8 fiend monsters such as Archfiend Empress and Curse Necrofear, to help overwhelm your opponent with destruction effects and pure attack power. The Extra Deck in this build is mainly used as utility for the likes of Pot of Disparity, and Dogmatika Punishment, but we can also go into Rank 8s such as Dingirsu and Zombiestein (sometimes you just need a beater!).</span>  <span>There's plenty of cards to help mill and search, such as Dark Spirit's Mastery, Void Apocalypse, Foolish Burial, and Danger! Mothman. The Dark Spirit monsters help revive your fiends and maintain pressure, whereas cards such as Skill Drain, Gozen Match and Mystic Mine help render your opponent powerless.</span>  <span>Mystic Mine works very well with Archfiends, as they rely on destroying themselves. Therefore, you can pop cards on the field with monsters such as Archfiend Emperor, only for him to get destroyed as well, ensuring that you always have less monsters until you need to push for lethal!</span>  <span>In addition, we also run 3 copies of Successor Soul and 2 copies of Zoa to send monsters rather than destroy. Since Archfiend Emperor destroys himself, you can use his effect to pop cards, then send an additional card through Successor Soul and then rewarding your efforts with a 2600 beatstick!</span>  <span><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/knVe6oSPUpc"">Check out the deck profile here</a></span>  <span>Enjoy, and until next time I'll see you around!</span>"

Their main strategy is to disrupt the opponent's plays with cards like Infinite Impermanence, Paleozoic Canadia, Paleozoic Dinomischus,  and the Solemn series of counter traps. Using such a large amount of traps allows them to take advantage of the effects of the Paleozoic traps from the GY, which special summon them as level 2 aqua type monsters. This just so happens to coincide with Toadally Awesome's summoning conditions, which is a powerful negation card. However, there is a plethora of rank 2 XYZ monsters to take advantage of. Post Phantom Rage, the deck doesn't actually change much. I just wanted an excuse to post this. But, it does add the new TCG card, Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder, which is an incredible piece of XYZ support. While being slightly situational, its ability to nuke the field effortlessly can't be ignored.  &nbsp;"

Unlimitied Pantheism makes Pot of Desires a viable option.","I used to be a big fan of this archetype, having invested a lot of time and love into building <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/dark-lockdown-monarchs/"">my own version</a> for a good couple of years, then stopped playing it during late 2018. That was the point where I realized that, even at full power, nothing but new support could ever bring the king of bricks back to their former glory; the meta is way faster, way more consistent, and with cards like <strong>Lightning Storm</strong>, <strong>Dark Ruler No More</strong> and <strong>Forbidden Droplet</strong> becoming the new powerful staples along <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> and <strong>Infinite Impermanence</strong> (which already gave Monarch players a pretty hard time to deal with), I'm confident that Domain Monarchs have been reduced to an archetype to play with, for fun, against your friends. That being said, since there's honestly no way to take consistent wins against more competitive decks, I decided to focus on making a build that is, at least, as consistent as it can get. You will still brick from time to time, it doesn't have a perfect search engine like other archetypes do, but at least you'll be able to do its main functions and get the feel that you're playing ""pure"" Monarchs.  &nbsp;  The main differences between this and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/dark-lockdown-monarchs/"">my previous build</a> are: <ol>  	<li>Having 3x copies of <strong>Pantheism</strong> allows for using <strong>Pot of Desires</strong> as a viable draw-card, without the danger of killing the only copy of the best card in the deck.</li>  	<li>Same goes for the <strong>Prime Monarch</strong>, where I have 2x copies this time around, which run better than 1x with an unlimited Pantheism, hence tribute fodder is better.</li>  	<li>Also, 3x copies of <strong>Ehther</strong> means easier to search, though running 6x lvl.8 Monarchs instead of 4x makes it slightly more dangerous to brick.</li>  	<li>Last but not least, running 2x copies of <strong>Majesty's</strong> instead of <strong>Vanity's</strong> suits <strong>Tenacity</strong> better, though I still believe that Tenacity is very occational and not that great of a card. Plus, the lack of <strong>Allure of Darkness</strong> opens slots for less Dark monsters, which is also a reason why I chose to run <strong>Mithra</strong> instead of <strong>Kaiser Vorse Raider</strong>; Pantheism and Desires bring more consistency, meaning you can more easily draw Monarchs and not rely on KVR's double nature.</li> </ol> &nbsp;  It's worth noting that I choose to main only 1x copy of <strong>Stormforth</strong>, as opening with even 1x when going first bricks hard. I save the remaining 2x copies for when going 2nd, while the rest of my Side Deck gives plenty of option to counter both monster-spams and spell/trap-spams."
