Good luck to you!

Take advantage of Victory Viper XX03's effect to summon Option Tokens to the field while powering up the main ship to put multiple powerful monsters on the field.

Lord British can attack more than once, take advantage of this to wipe out your opponent's Monster Zones and keep putting out damage.

Both of these, in tandem with the effects of Honest are a very powerful combination in the right circumstances."

Summer means holidays, sun and swimming, but also a lot of exciting games that are released. Mov has listed the hottest titles coming between June and August.
The hottest months of the year are perhaps more associated with sun, swimming and barbecuing than with video games, but that does not stop the industry from releasing a lot of exciting titles between June and August. <a>https://cruellahebrew.splashthat.com/</a>

The game was already catchy looking on Playstation 4, but this summer a new version will be released that has higher image update and generally nicer graphics on Playstation 5. <a>https://conjuring3hebrew.splashthat.com/</a>

The icing on the cake with this release is that a brand new episode follows while waiting for the regular sequel, which is about how the character Yuffie infiltrates the city of Midgar to steal a powerful magic from the evil organization Shinra, in parallel with the plot in the original . <a>https://conjuring3hebrew.splashthat.com/</a>

""Intergrade"" is simply a good excuse to replay the already fantastic game, or a great opportunity for newcomers to grab it. <a>https://f9hebrew.splashthat.com/</a>

Since the beginning of the 2000s, Insomniac Games has entertained players with its action-packed and colorful adventures with ""Ratchet &amp; Clank"", which now has a really nice sequel that uses the power of Playstation 5. <a>https://spacejamlegacyhebrew.splashthat.com/</a>

This time, the radar pair Ratchet and Clank once again fight the evil robot Dr Nefarious, who has acquired a weapon that can open portals to find an alternative universe where he always wins. Our heroes are separated in different dimensions, where Clank meets the new playable character Rivet.

this past weekend i learned alot of things. that destiny board, to <em>most</em> people, is one of the slickest alternative win conditions and will earn you heaps of respect. that agonizing over making your deck exactly 40 cards isn't the best idea when you're already worried about not being able to include cards that would mesh great with the deck. that the edopro shuffler is a cruel god that refuses to let me see a single super poly or waking the dragon from my side deck. but most importantly, i learned that it doesn't matter if you make the greatest destiny board list in the history of yugioh, any deck that can use effects better than, or equal to, a single raigeki break, <strong>will fuck you up.</strong>

my dreadful failure aside, it's plain to see how this deck can fuck. dark necrofear setting up for curse necrofear and the dark spirits keeping them in rotation, tour guide and fiendish rhino warrior to set up the grave and help go into the knightmares and maybe even accesscode, dark sanctuary keeping away attacks and protecting your spirit messages as well as giving material for linkuriboh and anima, dark spirit's mastery allowing you to go massively plus if your destiny board is destroyed halfway or your hand spells out ""THE"" aswell as searching a board or level 8 fiend, which includes abominable unchained soul to let you clap back if your opponent tries to remove your board. it's the <em>coolest shit ever.</em>

and don't even get me started on the side deck, all you need to worry about is the triple super poly, waking, and mystic mine accompanied by the risky set rotation, based one day of peace, handtrap killer called by, and the stupidest card i could think of, lullaby of obedience. it's genuinely fuckin nuts, cashews even. every monster is dark for super poly, popping backrow is literally how you win against destiny board so you can supremely bone them with an exterio, dark sanctuary is basically mystic mine's dropout cousin that's addicted to gambling, so having both in one deck is only natural, and if you're the boldest goober out there you can go and yoink your opponent's most important cards, at worst getting either free material for accesscode or a free discard for super poly and dark spirit's mastery.

now, i know the deck is still very flawed,

&nbsp;

so yea, that's the deck, a whopping last place finish at the only tournament i bother joining, now leave me alone while i cry about how this somehow did worse than egyptian convulsion and simultaneously remake egyptian convulsion for when the prismatic god box releases

<span>at least i got an accomplice to my based-as-fuck enterings on these chalislimes from this decklist</span>"

This time we’re talking a combo deck!,"The main combo starts with a single way of opening scrap recycler, you got 12 cards that can achieve this.

Normal summon recycler

Recycler effect mill rosenix

rosenix effect summon a token

limk for scrap wyvern

summon recycler and destroy it with wyvern

Wyvern again to summon scrap golem and destroy wyvern

use golem to summon recycler to your field

use recycler to mill cyber dragon core

use core’s effect to search Cyberdark world

link golem and recycler for protector welp

protector welp mills dragon buster

activate Cyberdark world and search a horn, edge, or keel

Use Cyberdark worlds effect to normal summon the monster you just added and then use that monster to equip dragon buster from the graveyard.

one card and you got a buster lock, this lock is fragile but if you have extenders and do a couple modifications to the combo you can get a power bound Cyberdarkness dragon with dragon buster equipped. If you’re lucky enough you can also have Cyberdark invasion set to recycle your lock when Cyberdarkness uses it’s negate, I’ve once had Cyberdarkness with buster lock, invasion, and inferno (which protects it) basically making a win game situation unless the have a kaiju, they didn’t btw and I won two turns after it was all set up."

The dots never go out? In Disney's punk ""Cruella"" we meet a sympathetic version of the supervillain Cruella de Vil - but the result is unfortunately not completely spotless. <a>https://centervagt.wildapricot.org/10575712</a>
Whether it's the adorable cartoon versions or the more realistic variations, the Dalmatians Pongo, Perdita, and their 101 puppies are for most of us a part of our childhood. In the children's films, the cute puppies are nastyly stolen by the unpleasant diva Cruella - a dramatic lady in black and white hair, who can, uh, walk over corpses to get her claws in her long-awaited fur. <a>https://retfaerdighedens-ryttere.wildapricot.org/news/10575834</a>

In the 2021 ""Cruella"", we start again from the beginning and meet a young Estella (Emma Stone), miles from the terrifying Cruella we feel today. Estella has hopes and dreams of becoming a fashion designer, but life takes its toll and in a tragic accident involving her own mother, both fear and disgust for Dalmatian dogs arise. As a troubled teenager, she ends up on the streets among London's shady neighborhoods. <a>https://wptest.candle.com.tw/community/profile/conanfilm2021/</a>

Together with newcomer companions Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Water Hauser), the petty thieves make the streets unsafe - until Estella encounters the biggest boss of them all, the Baroness (Emma Thompson). Estella now has to weigh how much of herself is the everyday and friendly Estella, and how much is now taken up by her more theatrical persona - Cruella. <a>https://oldpelicula2021.wildapricot.org/pelicula/10576619</a>

In the footsteps of the acclaimed ""Joker"" (2019), ""Birds of Prey"" (2020), and the upcoming TV series ""Loki"" (2021), it is thus villain stories that are highly topical on the wallpaper.  <a>https://pakleneulice9.wildapricot.org/</a> Nobody wants to see a hell hero save the cat from the tree, we rather want to see how the torn cat ended up there from the very beginning. ""Cruella"" wants to be challenging and extravagant, but the film comes to itself that it is ultimately part of a family-oriented Disney world.

Cruella is a difficult figure to deal with, you have to give it to them anyway. A lot of other famous villains, for example Cinderella's ""Maleficent"" (2014) gave us a anything but light-hearted background story that made the fairy tales' division into black or white blurred at the edges. But Cruella, how do you instill sympathy in such a hated character - the one who literally made fur coats out of dogs?

The soundtrack to ""Cruella"" is awesome with The Clash, Blondie, and The Doors. There are cool costumes, glamorous balls, and the vicious fashion and clothing-filled scenes of the dynamics of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2006). But with a superficial theme, unfortunately, also comes a superficial result, as the desire to get a time-typical depth in Emma Stone's villain is spun away in the eagerness to make the film both dramatic and furiously elegant. <a>https://steemit.com/denmark/@dk-sv-no-fi/synopsis-cruella-og-hvordan-man-ser-online-med-tekst-dansk</a>

""Cruella"" is definitely a cool film, where both Emma Thompson and Emma Stone make spotless contributions as their respective fashion stars. As the film is supposed to be edgy and a relatively dark story, I strongly miss the humorous touch that Glenn Close added in his role as live-action Cruella in ""101 Dalmatians"" (1996). The rest of the film is too long, too annoying - all the gala events will soon be tiring to watch - and not as innovative as I had imagined. ""Cruella"" does not deserve all the barking, but it would clearly have offered more nostalgia and less superficiality."

The monster you will be using to kill you opponent will be <a data-name=""Megalith Phaleg"">Megalith Phaleg</a> because of it's attack boost for each ritual card  in your GY, this also works best when this is two or more of <a data-name=""Phaleg"">Phaleg</a> on the flied as the attack boost stacks and you use a lot of ritual card to summon ritual card. <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> popping effect is also great because you should at least have two different ritual cards in your GY by the time you summon <a data-name=""Bethor"">Bethor</a>. <a data-name=""Megalith Phul"">Megalith Phul</a> is the best way to summon Megalith monsters, since you can target cards in your deck and then ditch cards from your hand putting them into the GY. But since it is also a quick effect if you can activate during your opponents turn to summon something like <a data-name=""Megalith Bethor"">Megalith Bethor</a> to destroy their card during their turn. The Impcantation cards are there for search and return, <a data-name=""Impcantation Talismandra"">Impcantation Talismandra</a> on summon from deck adds Megalith ritual monster, <a data-name=""Impcantation Penciplume"">Impcantation Penciplume</a> returns Megalith ritual monster from GY, though <a data-name=""Talismandra"">Talismandra</a> and <a data-name=""Penciplume"">Penciplume</a> you can reveal ritual and summon the other from deck you can use <a data-name=""Impcantation Chalislime"">Impcantation Chalislime</a> to discard it's self to summon one from deck.

This deck in its own way has gained even more consistency with the new cards that came in the latest Booster Pack, LIGHTNING OVERDRIVE. With the addition of cards like ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=When%20A.I.%20First%20Met%20You"">A.I. Meet You</a>"", and the newest Link-1 monster for the archetype, ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dark%20Infant%20%40Ignister"">Dark Infant @Ignister</a>"", which added the more consistency to the Deck.

The main strategy of the Deck is swarming your Cyberse monsters, from your hand, Graveyard, and Extra Deck, which can be easily made with their field Spell ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Ignister%20A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I. Land</a>"", that allows you to Special Summon your Ignister monsters from your hand, as long as you control no monsters in your Main Monster Zone, and you can use its effect as many times you can! Since this card is a Once Per-Attribute, which makes you not able to Special Summon a second monster with the same Attribute as another @Ignister you summoned previously with its effect. To Special Summon your @Ignister monsters from your graveyard you can use cards like ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=A.I.dle%20Reborn"">A.I.Dle Reborn</a>"", which is a Quick-Play Spell that lets you Summon any of your @Ignisters, ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Splash%20Mage"">Splash Mage</a>"" for a single multi reborn, and ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Transcode%20Talker"">Transcode Talker</a>"" for your Link Monsters, which can be used for a Link Summon of ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Accesscode%20Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>"" that can bring you the win in many cases.

For more disruptions you can run basic trap cards, such as ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Infinite%20Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Paleozoic%20Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>"", ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Solemn%20Strike"">Solemn Strike</a>"", and in optional, ""<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Compulsory%20Evacuation%20Device"">Compulsory Evacuation Device</a>"".

<strong>Simple Combo:
</strong>This combo is a simple one, which all you need is 1 Achichi, and 1 Doyon in your hand.

You first Normal Summon your Achichi, and you search for a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Bururu%20%40Ignister"">Bururu @Ignister</a>.

Next you are going to Link Summon into your Dark Infant, which will let you add an Ignister A.I. Land directly from your Deck.

Activating your A.I. Land you are going to use its effect to Special Summon Bururu, and using Bururu's effect to Send a <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Pikari%20%40Ignister"">Pikari @Ignister</a> from your Deck to your Graveyard.

Using your Dark Infant and your Bururu, you go for a Link-2 of Splash Mage.

Following that you use your Ignister A.I. Land to Special Summon your Doyon, and using its effect to add Pikari from your Graveyard to your hand.

Using Splash Mage's effect you can either Summon your Bururu or Achichi, which doesn't matter which you want to Summon.

By Linking your 3 monsters, Doyon, Splash Mage, and your Special Summoned monster into a Link Summon of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Dark%20Templar%20%40Ignister"">Dark Templar @Ignister</a>.

Ignister A.I. Land to a Special Summon of your Pikari, triggering your Dark Templar, which in this card you are going to declare Pikari's effect before the Dark Templar.

With Dark Templar, you are going to Summon your Bururu, and Doyon, and with Pikari you are going to add A.I.Dle Reborn to your hand.

Next you Synchro Summon using your Bururu and Doyon into <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Wind%20Pegasus%20%40Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a>  triggering Bururu's effect, while allows you to Summon 1 of the Synchro Materials used for the Synchro Summon, bringing back Doyon.

Using Pikari's second effect, you are going to make your Wind Pegasus a Level 4, and using Pikari and Wind Pegasus for an Xyz Summon of <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Light%20Dragon%20%40Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> .

And finally, using your Doyon and Dark Templar into your Link-4 <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://db.ygoprodeck.com/card/?search=Topologic%20Bomber%20Dragon"">Topologic Bomber Dragon</a> , and ending by setting your A.I.Dle Reborn.

This combo gives you a monster destruction by using Topologic Bomber's effect and A.I.Dle Reborn to Special Summon any of your @Ignisters, and combining Light Dragon's effect that prevents destruction in order to protect your monsters. And when using Light Dragon's effect that protects your monsters, you must detach Wind Pegasus in order to use its effect in the Graveyard when you are able.

<span>2019 Orcust was the strongest deck of the TOSS/Eternal Format, it was generic (until the mermaid ban), it could make VFD (until the rusty ban), had an very good grindgame and had cards like crescendo and dingirsu which were pretty good interuptions and protections. And then the 2020 banlist happened and pretty much killed the deck with the ban of harp horror, many orcust players hoped that mekk-knight orcust girsu could make the deck good again, but sadly it failed and MR5 wasn't helping. With the new Eldlich deck which was combined with the jet-synchro/halqifibrax/auroradon combo and adamanicipator which could gain huge amounts of advantage with block dragon and make almost unbreakable boards with a buster dragon lock, the age of orcust was over. </span>

<span>Until some crazy dude thought: Wait a sec... Eldlich has a pretty good grind game, wasn't there another good grind deck which was meta and had pretty good cards. And this is probably how Orcust Eldlich was created, sadly this deck toped 2 times (as much as I know) and harp is still banned. So the deck is not a tier 1 contender, but hey the deck looks like a good rogue/tier 2 deck to me.  </span>

<span>So basically the deck uses the orcust engine to get crescendo, which is an omni negate as a counter trap. And they also use it to get dingirsu which protects your backrow from stuff like lightning storm, sends a card on the field to the gy and recycles banished orcust monster. The other engine is eldlich which replaces traps, can summon golden lord as a beatstick with protection and uses golden lord as interuption.

Auroradon is prefect for a lair of darkness deck as you will come to see if you play this deck.

You can use a cursed eldland to bate an ash and then follow through with this combo.

With lair of darkness on the field, you can tribute golden lord for either of the viruses to get rid of their spell, traps or monsters with 1500 or less def.

this deck can be blocky at times but it's really fun to play if you draw a decent enough hand.

Any improvements would be appreciated.

Hope you enjoy this composition."

You do not become legendary by being kind. This is the (possibly dubious) message in Disney's ""Cruella"", about the iconic villain's young years. Emma Stone plays fashion-loving Estella, whose feuds with a legendary designer (Emma Thompson) make her pick out her inner troublemaker. Gone are the cute 101 Dalmatians, the focus is instead on the sharp competition of two determined women. <a>https://architizer.com/firms/release-date/</a>

- They let Craig (Gillespie) and Tony (McNamara) write what they wanted. It was undeniably darker than a regular Disney movie, but not as dark as a child-forbidden movie, says Stone. <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/fastandfurious9denmark/</a>

Who do you prefer among Estella and Cruella, and who was a bigger challenge to play?

Stone: It's interesting, because Estella gets rejected at some point. She is cute but not completely realized. There's something exciting about Cruella, she's who she is. I'm more interested in her world. But she crosses certain boundaries that I would never do but… I prefer Cruella. it's so much fun to play over! <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/centervagt/</a>

She does not think she's the villain.

Stone: I could never play someone who's just mean. No one who is evil thinks they are evil. They think they are right.

What was the craziest outfit you wore, something that made you 100 percent Cruella? <a>https://hairlosshelp.dk/community/profile/smagen-af-sult/</a>

Stone: My absolute favorite was the dress I wore on the garbage truck, because it had a 13 meter long trailer. It was not part of the dress because I would not have been able to move otherwise. They put it on at the last minute when we were going to film. There was nothing to wear in reality, not even nearby. Then there is an epic dress where I cover the whole car, it was also fantastic. Then you know you're in a movie.

This is the deck for you!,"The full combo for this deck is opening up 2 level 3 monsters and either
feather storm or trap trick which gets us our feather storm.
Besides that you pretty much play a regular Burning Abyss.
This allows us to just simply go second, while virtually FTKing when
going first. The lock is very devasating, although counters do exist.
One can then easily side out the simorgh/feather storm engine game 2
and 3 if you are playing a match.This lock might even have competitive potential, although the pricetag
might scare some people away.
In reality many expensive cards can be replaced however."

Then this might be the deck for you!,"Kozmo is a classic deck that focuses on summoning strong monsters from
their main deck. Their ability to OTK is still hard to match. Their biggest
issue lies in Emergency Teleport and Reasoning still being limited.These being at 1 definitely hold them back sadly, but even with those
at 1 new cards like Pot of Extravagence breathe new life into them.If you like a strategy focused around big monsters from the main deck
but don’t really like going all in on control, Kozmo might be the deck for
you. Also they have cool space ships. Who doesn’t like space ships?"
