He, alongside Obelisk &amp; Ra share the same summoning condition that requires a Tribute Summon of 3 monsters and when Summoned, neither player can activate cards or effects. Slifer unique effects are that its gains 1000 Atk/Def for each card in your hand; if your opponent Normal or Special Summons one or more monsters, all of those monsters loses 2000 Atk/Def and if its Atk becomes 0 by this effect, they are immediately destroyed; also, if it was Special Summoned instead of Tribute Summoned, it sends itself to the GY at the End Phase of that turn. A very iconic boss monster that, in my opinion, has of the most strongest floodgate effects if your opponent cant get rid of it.

Both Slifer and Obelisk recieved new support cards in order to favor their playstyle, as well as making them a bit easier to summon and what legacy support would exist without making them cards that represent their signature attacks in the anime?

Since this is the Slifer deck, we'll start with his signature card, <strong>Thunderforce Attack</strong>. Is a Quick-Play Spell that can only be activated while you control AN ORIGINAL <strong>Slifer the Sky Dragon</strong>; it allows you to destroy as many face-up monsters your opponent controls. After that, it gives you the choice of drawing cards equal to the number of destroyed monsters that were sent to the opponent's GY (this is to prevent the player to place your own monsters or tokens and then blow them up), but if you do, you can only declare 1 attack for the rest of the turn. It can act as a Quick-Play <strong>Raigeki</strong> while also being a +1/+2 in the most common scenarios, however it can be bricky and requires setup. Playing it at 3 can be risky, so I recommend playing 2.

Next is another Quick-Play Spell, <strong>Soul Crossing</strong>. During the Main Phase, immediately after the effect resolves, you can Tribute Summon a Divine-Beast monster by tributing any 3 monsters on the field, including your opponents (by the way, yes, you can use up to 3 of your opponents' monsters). If you used at least 1 monster that belongs to your opponent, you can only activate 1 card effect for the rest of the turn, but the effects of Divine-Beast monsters are excluded from this effect lock. Unless your opponent negates this card effect, this is card is a non-target, non-destruction removal of 1 to 3 of their monsters, while also giving you a free monster. This is a safe 3 of, and also allows to play 3 copies of Slifer since it can prevent it from being a brick in your hand.

The last new support card that I used from the deck is <strong>Ultimate Divine-Beast</strong>, a Continuous Trap. If your opponent declares an attack, you can discard 1 Spell/Trap to Special Summon a Divine-Beast monster from the GY in Defense Position and then it redirects the attack to itself. During the End Phase: if you control a Divine-Beast monster, you can destroy all face-up cards your opponent controls that activated their effect this turn. While it can be a bit costly to activate, it has good effects and yes, you can activate the second effect before Slifer goes back to the GY.

The deck also includes <strong>Tellus the Little Angel</strong> and <strong>Millenium Seeker</strong> as support cards, but this build will not use them. As a quick explanation, <strong>Tellus the Little Angel</strong> is a token generator that works from the GY, and <strong>Millenium Seeker</strong> can Special Summon itself for the hand but it has a very double-edged effect.

And now, the outside support:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Level 10 Slimes</strong> (*sad train noises*): This Structure Deck features <strong>Reactor Slime</strong> and <strong>Metal Reflect Slime</strong>. <strong>Reactor Slime</strong>, during the Main Phase, can Special Summon 2 tokens, but locks you on only summoning Divine-Beast monsters for the rest of the turn; and during the Battle Phase, as a Quick Effect, can send itself to the GY to set a <strong>Metal Reflect Slime</strong> from your hand, Deck or GY and it can be activated that turn (which is a Continuous Trap that Special Summons itself as a Level 10 WATER Aqua monster with 0 Atk/3000 Def). In order to have the full engine, I added 3 copies of <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> and <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong>. <strong>Guardian Slime</strong> is a Level 10 WATER Aqua monster with 0 Atk/Def that can Special Summon itself from the hand if you take battle or effect damage. During damage calculation, it can make its Def equal to an attacking monsters' Atk. If it is sent to the GY from the hand or field, it can search any Spell/Trap that enlists ""<strong>The Winged Dragon of Ra</strong>"" on its text. On the other hand, <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong> is a Level 10 WATER Aqua Fusion monster with 3000 Atk/Def that can also be Special Summoned by Tributing 1 Level 10 Aqua monster with 0 Atk. It cannot be destroyed by battle, your opponent can only target this card for both attacks and effects and it can be treated as 3 tributes for a Tribute Summon. Both cards are very reliable and grants a lot of protection to the deck while paired with...</li>
 	<li><strong>Mound of the Bound Creator</strong>: A Field Spell that makes Level 10 or higher monsters unable to be destroyed or targeted by card effects, if they destroy a monster by battle it burns the opponent for 1000 and if it is destroyed, you can add 1 DIVINE monster from your Deck to your hand. If <strong>Egyptian God Slime</strong> is on the field, it indirectly makes your entire field untargetable for card effects while making him a nearly undestructible monster that protects your monsters from being attacked. And since Slifer is also Level 10, not only it can be searched, but is also protected by the Field Spell. A <strong>Terraforming</strong> is added to the mix to either search it or search...</li>
 	<li><strong>Lair of Darkness package</strong>: This Deck also features <strong>Ahrima, the Wicked Warden</strong>, <strong>Duke Shade, the Sinister Shadow</strong> &amp; <strong>Lair of Darkness</strong>; where its intended use is for using the <strong>Torment Tokens</strong> as Tribute fodder. By this logic, both <strong>Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair</strong> &amp; <strong>Lilith, Lady of Lament</strong> to use their effects in combination with <strong>Lair of Darkness</strong>. In the Side Deck, I added some of the Trap Cards it could be useful for this deck's playstyle that can be searched with Lilith's effect.</li>
 	<li><strong>Millenium Revelation</strong>: Since I wanted to give a use to <strong>Guardian Slime</strong>'s search effect, I added a copy of this card. Is a Continuous Spell that can send a Divine-Beast monster from the hand to the GY to add <strong>Monster Reborn</strong> from your Deck or GY to the hand. It also has another effect related to Ra's Summoning condition, but I mostly use it to search <strong>Monster Reborn</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Extra Deck: Pretty much anything you like. In my case, I added Synchro and Link monsters that could help to draw more cards, and a Halqifibrax as an extender; since this deck actually runs a Tuner, that being Scapeghost.</li>
</ul>
And that's for the Slifer version. The Obelisk version will be uploaded later today or tomorrow. Also, I would like to say that from now on, I'll try to post new recipes for the series every 2 weeks, on Fridays. This will give me time to playtest the decks and see which pros and cons each one has.

Anyway, thanks for reading all this wall of text as always and I hope you like this kind of decks."

The Twin of my other Rose-themed deck ""World of Roses"".","<blockquote><div>Death offers you thorns, eternity offers you roses, and life offers you both.</div></blockquote>
There is only one thing in YuGiOh! that I love as much as I love Cyber Dragons: Rose Dragons!

The Rose Dragon archetype to me has always been a cool concept, Dragons and Roses combined, centered around Synchro summoning. The archetype features one of the most beautiful set of artworks in my eyes. However, the Rose Dragons have never been a really consistent or all around strong archetype. There was always something missing, an important part that somehow got lost. Until now. With the release of Lightning Overdrive, the deck got all the cards it needed so desperately. ""<a data-name=""Basal Rose Shoot"">Basal Rose Shoot</a>"" for example, is a wonderful spell to make the effect of ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" change from an all-in suicide bomb into a black hole with self protection. The archetype also got a new field spell with ""<a data-name=""White Rose Cloister"">White Rose Cloister</a>"". Nothing crazy but it shouldn't be underestimated.

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/NQoaPOi.png"" alt=""image"" />

Anyways, let's get to the ""how-to-use"" section of this page. It's actually really not that hard, not that special. The heart of the deck are the Rose Dragonlings. ""<a data-name=""White Rose Dragon"">White Rose Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Blue Rose Dragon"">Blue Rose Dragon</a>"" are your LVL 4 non-tuners while ""<a data-name=""Red Rose Dragon"">Red Rose Dragon</a>"" as well as ""<a data-name=""Roxrose Dragon"">Roxrose Dragon</a>"" are your LVL 3 tuner monsters, which you will be use mainly to summon your Boss monsters like ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Dragon"">Black Rose Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Black Rose Moonlight Dragon"">Black Rose Moonlight Dragon</a>"" as well as ""<a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Dragon"">Ruddy Rose Dragon</a>"". To keep a good 50:50 between Dragon type monsters and monsters of a different type is important to get ""<a data-name=""Crossrose Dragon"">Crossrose Dragon</a>"" out more easily, which then goes into your Synchros without the need to fulfill its LVL requirements. You basicly go around the whole process of Synchro summoning via adding up the monsters levels to each others, basicly call it ""Alternative Synchro Summoning"". ""<a data-name=""Rose Princess"">Rose Princess</a>"", altho not being a tuner, can act as one as well if you summon her with her effect. Otherwise, if you don't already have it, you use her to search out ""White Rose Cloister"" as this helps you to easily bring out a tuner and a non-tuner (or simply two monsters) in one turn, by allowing you to special summon a Rose Dragonling or a plant type monster from your hand in case you don't control any monsters but your opponent does. It also helps you buff your LVL 7 Dragon Synchros for a whole 1000 ATK if you make a right guess at the beginning of your turn. Via ""<a data-name=""Ruddy Rose Witch"">Ruddy Rose Witch</a>"", you can even put a plant-type monster on top of your deck, to make the guess for the next turn a 100% right one. The 50:50 in therms of monster types also lets you use ""<a data-name=""Frozen Rose"">Frozen Rose</a>"" more effectively if you are willing to make a little sacrifice. Once you got your Rose-Synchro Boss monsters out, you can protect them more easily with your trap cards. ""<a data-name=""Blooming of the Darkest Rose"">Blooming of the Darkest Rose</a>"" lets your Black Rose Dragon ""dodge"" a fatal blow/effect from your opponent, while ""<a data-name=""Shadow Impulse"">Shadow Impulse</a>"" lets you swap your Synchro monsters, in case your opponent destroy one of them. This works with Black Rose Dragon -&gt; Black Rose Moonlight Dragon and vice versa as well as Ruddy Rose Dragon -&gt; ""<a data-name=""Ascension Sky Dragon"">Ascension Sky Dragon</a>"" and vice versa which leaves you at least not completely open, if your opponent gets over your Synchros. ""<a data-name=""Synchro Transmission"">Synchro Transmission</a>"" however lets you place a trap for your opponent to easily wipe the whole board before he ends his Main Phase if you use it to summon a Black Rose Dragon, as well as giving you a nice little extra card in your next turn, by sending your Black Rose Dragon back to your Extra Deck.

All around I really gotta say that Lightning Overdrive definetely brought some new delicious stuff to this archetype, mostly with its brand new Boss monster; the Ruddy Rose Dragon; as well as with the spell card Basal Rose Shoot. Thanks to Roxrose Dragon, it's almost laughably easy to bring out a Black Rose Dragon which then immediately goes into its new, stronger variant.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 vector pendulum, another name</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 darkwurm, darkwurm is just a good card in general, I couldn’t refuse it tbh</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 skullcrowbat joker, it came back! I used to not think anything of it’s return but now that I learned of how well it works in dracoslayer I changed my mind, it searches revolution dragon who in turn searches luster pendulum, plus it a level 4 pendulum, I’d play 3 if possible tbh.</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 double iris, I mean, star pendulumgraph is useful plus it just got out of the banlist so I may as well as get it some use, right?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 celestial magician, provides two namesakes and a end phase search for the grind so it go’s a slot.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 pendulum sorcerer, one of the ace cards searching skullcrobat joker and celestial magician, and triggering destruction effects, not bad.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 hexasaucer, a little tech I thought up of, hexasaucer is the closest I have at the moment to plushfire, so I took it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 harmonizing, summoning free synchros sense the pendulum era</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Star pendulumgraph, search for iris, floats your cards</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 dragon shrine, for dumping master pendulum and darkwurm, the idea of dumping pendulum is because dinoster summons from the graveyard</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 duelist alliance, allowing you to search any dracoslayer or dracoverlord, they’re all pendulum cards!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 pendulum call, im playing enough pendulum magicians that it would be wrong not to play it, right?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 draco face-off, setup for play, wish it was at 3</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 infinite impenitence, for the sake of having something to do on their turn</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 starving venom, gateway zero summon</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 dinoster power, as an extender and protection</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 ignister prominence, easily one of my favorite cards of all time, prominence is a deck summoner and boss in one.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 supreme king dragon clear wing, another boss</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 number 38, with all of these level 8 dragons I just decided to play it</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 arc rebellion, a seriously powerful way to push for game, I love it</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 supreme king dragon dark rebellion, namesake, extender, and beatstick that can sometimes turn a game around if your opponents monster is big enough</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 timestar, literally only there because it searches, protection is just an added bonus</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 raider’s knight, how else would you summon arc rebellion? It’s what makes it work!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 ascending dracoslayer, extender, look below</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 draco future, because the ascending dracoslayer searches on its end phase and then gives you a monster that can help you summon a different dracoslayer which summons a dracoslayer monster to help you get another ascending dracoslayer you can do that chain for a utopic future, it’s complex but effective</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 utopic future, to get dragon, why not?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The deck is really weird and is entirely wing it</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Strong points: </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This deck is really good at recursion and really resilient with all of the floating</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There are tons of searchers and lots of card advantage, it’s really hard to open a hand so bad you can’t do anything, you’ll always have something in the end if you go uninterrupted (which is unlikely but most of the time you can even go interrupted)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you’re opponent is in the advantage you can suddenly surprise them with some super unexpected and sometimes stupid stuff like “arc rebellion shake”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Weak points</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The pendulum mechanic sucks at times</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You always want to start off with getting luster pendulum out, this can lead to some easy turn ending negates at times</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Droll is an absolute pain for this deck</span></p>"

Use these monsters to link/xyz summon various monsters. Extra deck is pretty subjective to whichever cards you want to run. I personally like #13 and #31. They're easy to get both out and can force your opponent into attacking them and taking the damage. I chose I:P as a way to give protection to other link monsters. Still looking for link monsters that may be more useful than the ones currently in the deck."

It also grants you one extra summon, and gives Ra the power to absorb the ATK/DEF of the monsters tributed to summon him. These are all self-evidently great effects that don't need much examination, but here are a few general notes about making the most of this spell:</div><div>1. Just playing the card gives you an extra tribute summon. You have to remember to banish it from your graveyard before performing the tribute summon if you want Ra to gain the tributes' ATK. On that note, <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=5253985"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/5253985.jpg"" data-card=""5253985"" data-name=""Soul Crossing"">Soul Crossing</span></a> lets you sacrifice your opponent's monsters for a Divine monster (like Ra!). <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=5253985"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/5253985.jpg"" data-card=""5253985"" data-name=""Soul Crossing"">Soul Crossing</span></a> is a Quick-Play spell, and that's obviously awesome, but if you play it as a normal spell on your turn, you can banish <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=78665705"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78665705.jpg"" data-card=""78665705"" data-name=""Ancient Chant"">Ancient Chant</span></a> from your graveyard first, and Ra will absorb your opponent's monsters' ATK points. This can lead to some interesting variations on Ra's ATK, since the only monsters of your own you'll ever really be sacrificing are Reactor Slime and its two slime tokens for 1500 base ATK points, or <a class=""type-fusion-monster"" href=""/card/?search=42166000"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/42166000.jpg"" data-card=""42166000"" data-name=""Egyptian God Slime"">Egyptian God Slime</span></a>&nbsp;for 3000. Of course, that base ATK is in addition to the life points you can then pay to Ra's ATK.</div><div>2. On rare occasions, you might find yourself in a situation where all three copies of Ra are in the graveyard, and you have the Sphere Mode of Ra in play. Sphere Mode only searches Ra from hand or deck. <a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=78665705"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/78665705.jpg"" data-card=""78665705"" data-name=""Ancient Chant"">Ancient Chant</span></a>&nbsp;can put Ra back into your hand from the graveyard in this instance, letting you activate an otherwise useless Sphere Mode.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a class=""type-spell-card"" href=""/card/?search=4059313"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""card-editor-tooltip"" title="""" data-image=""https://images.ygoprodeck.com/images/cards/4059313.jpg"" data-card=""4059313"" data-name=""Blaze Cannon"">Blaze Cannon</span></a>&nbsp;is the card that turns Ra into the all-powerful, game-warping god that he was in the anime. It is a quick-play spell that can't be negated, and it grants Ra three effects for one turn:</div><div>1. Ra is unaffected by your opponent's cards' effects</div><div>2.

This is simply untrue; the confusing design of Ra, with its ""?""

Basically we try and keep it really similiar, just adding a few more fusion target, a new side play for heavenly sphere and thats mostly it. The most important thing is, that we are not aiming for five head dragon + 1-2 negates anymore. We rather try to set up follow up turns where we explode and sheer force our self over the opponents board, or grind them turn by turn out.

Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.

The dragonmaid core :

3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.

3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere

1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.

1 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl or House in rare cases. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.

2 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !

3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~ Also REMEMBER the targets once targeted dont need to stay on board to resolve. You can tar sphere, chain sphere and bounce 2 cards.

1 Dragonmaid Ernus : Can summon a maid in your opponents turn before they set up the negats , else just for its name and level

1 Dragonmaid Lorpar : Name and Level again. But its also a decent card to force a negate with its discard effect.

&nbsp;

Rokket :

2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free  Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time. Also its a 1 card I:P , allows you to do guardragon through hand traps and is always a combo saver / extender / starter.

1 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up

1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice. ( Update : after maybe 100 games, the banish eff still never came up. Still a different name so we keep it)

1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector
<ol>
 	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li>
 	<li> 3x Quick Launch : Not once per turn free rokket Monster</li>
</ol>
Dragons :

2 Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.

2 Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With Sky Striker and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion. Also it lets you dig for super poly and other cards which may save your day when the opponent starts playing solitair. Also it annoys sky striker and we love to do that

1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender. Or send Gram for another big body. Also cleans your hand of cards you dont want to have there

1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search  Parlor or....well there is only Parlor left. Maybe Lorpar in rare cases?

1 Fallen of Albaz : You summon him of Sphere most of the time and just poly away their boss Monster for a titanclad, its a easy dragoon out, as if they negate sphere bounce you just summon him and fusion dragoon away. Its probably my favorite non maid in this deck. ALSO we have a new combo for him, I will explain later.

Hand traps : 3 Ash + Super poly/ Lancea . Super poly is king in this deck as we can also use it during the BP to get a bit more damage on board, while it also just ruins dragonlinks day, and annoys shadoll / invoked to no compare.

2 Ghost Bell : With Tri bri, Sky Striker and Drytron running around this card became much more important again. Specially as it can negate tri bri revolution which is usally the end of the game for them

Extra :

1x Dragonmaid Sheou : Its your best card, its your free summon omni negate, waifu, dragon. Also we play only one because she shuffels herself back.

2x House Dragonmaid : So we can use Sheou omni negate, or pop a whole opponents board. We can shuffel her back and usually dont need more

1x Borrel Savage : Omni negate, whats to say. Sadly not a maid

1x Titanclad the Ashdragon : Summon of Albaz to remove a boss monster or if its send by maximus to get you a free albaz to combo with / fusion into venom dragon

1x Starving Venom Dragon : Its a awesome super poly / fallen of Albaz target. While also a threat to the board right after being summoned.

1x Romulus : Searches Dragon Ravine for you and is a good link 2 target with good zones

1x Pitsy  : The extender dragon which is the last link guardragon not banned YET.  Its a link 1 dragon we can summon to extend and can still use zones of goddess and five head. But dont force a summon with it without the 2. Its rarely worth it

2x Sphere : One of the stronges interrupts in the game + free summon from deck + good zones + being a dragon + 1 card out to dragoon. And can make any light based deck go -3. Will explain that combo in the side deck

1x Mudragon : Super poly target , also the target protection is lovely against sky striker

1x Striker Dragon : link 1. dragon. searches boot sector launch. the only thing this thing misses is a it pointing downwards

1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World : The new card we try to abuse, or atleast flex with. We usually will always summon her with I:p but its not to hard  summon her with all the dragons and maids rotating at all times. She also doesnt care about DRM and all the annoying things being played. Laughing at Dragoon with her only being outed in battle

1x Link God Dragon/ Fiveheaded Link Dragon : We want to make him almost every turn, as your opponent will 99,99% not play anything that can out this thing. You will have a full grave for atleast 3-4 turns were you could just sit on it , but as you play maids, you will just combo again and again with a 5k beater who cant be stopped.

Side deck : Its really up to you what you play in here but this combo I wanna showcase

1x Albion fusion dragon :

1 x Rokket fusion dragon :

The combo is basically to use sphere to bounce a card of your opponent (-1) summon Fallen of Albus and fusion it with a n opponents light monster into Albion (-2) , summon with Albion Rokket fusion and pop another card with its effect (-3)

All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on more. But keeping a few hand traps, traps is currently better.

Afterwords : I am happy with how this deck developed over the past months and I think it was close to being as good as this version can be. However the elpy bann really weakend it sadly, more than anyone expacted. The deck rewards you for making decisions in either players turn while also having straight goals which you play towards. But in the end the best part of this deck is, having your opponents scoop instantly after playing five head / no fully realizing how immun it is / not wanting to belive what they read for a moment, while than seeing that they are now on the glock to out this thing or lose.

I think in all my games only 1-2 Persons were able to win after it was summoned. One was just stalling until I ran out of cards to banish other was a Kaiju top deck. So its still a good average of staying and winning you the game.

And thats my new crap guide to Dragonmaid, you welcome."

THE BOX OF GAWBAGE DECK!!!,"<strong>BEHOLD! THE BOX OF GAWBAGE DECK!!!</strong>
Now sit back son and i will tell you the creation of the Box of Gawbage deck. It was a day like no other, I wanted a deck that had a lot of special summoning but I didn't want to use any main/popular archetypes at the time. I grew interest in garbage lord and his effect as well as others like rescue rabbit and tour guide. It's a simple deck with Box of Friends and Garbage Lord and his Ogre friends. <em><strong>The Goal</strong></em> is when you have a Garbage Lord in your hand you can special summon it, with Lab Wall or Mill Shield on the field you can then use shield &amp; sword for an awesome combo. The XYZ's are just a bonus as well as the instant fusion i just added as fodder plus to put those 3k def monsters to use instead of wasting to the GY you could XYZ summon.

<strong>MONSTERS</strong>

For the meat of the deck, Melffys, the three best for this build are Fennec, Puppy, and Catty. By returning to your hand on an opponent's summon or battle declaration, Fennec allows you to special summon a Beast from the hand, Puppy allows you to special summon a Level 2 Beast from the deck, and Catty allows you to add a Beast to your hand from the deck. Overall, these three have the best main-deck synergy and open up the board to the other combos of the deck. Ponpoko is a great lead into Tantan, who can special summon Kalantosa, which when special summoned by a Beast, it can destroy any card on the field. This makes Kalantosa the main-deck's carry to maintain board. Additionally, Valerifawn has the ability to special summon Kalantosa from the GY (proccing effect), and leading into, at lowest, level 4 synchro plays. Alpha is also a good emergency monster for when the opponent has board, between being able to special summon from hand if your opponent has a higher total attack point value (which is common since Melffys have the attacking power of a wet napkin), and being able to send Beasts from the field back to the hand to send face-up monsters on your opponent's field to their hand (which is good for clearing extra deck summons). To top it off, Barrier Statue of the Drought is a safety net to keep your opponent from building a non-Earth board for as long as possible.

&nbsp;

<strong>SPELLS</strong>

Most importantly, Obedience Schooled is ideal in a starting hand, first or second. Special summons three Level 2 or lower Beasts from the deck to the field, with the drawback of their effects being negated and only being able to summon Beasts for the rest of the turn (which is good for this deck, since extra deck plays are the build's extenders and carry). Equally important, Hide-and-Seek, which prevents card effect destruction once per turn and can shuffle three Beasts with different names from the GY to the deck, then drawing one card afterwards. Next, Child's Play is incredible in a combo-heavy meta and, if your opponent goes nuts, 10,000 life points is easy to achieve to prevent your monsters from being destroyed by battle, and Foolish Burial is included for the sake of getting Kalantosa to the GY easily to pave the way for Valerifawn. For control, Twin Twisters and Harpie's Feather Duster are solid means of keeping backrow in check.

&nbsp;

<strong>TRAPS</strong>

Mirror Force. Less is more.

&nbsp;

<strong>EXTRA DECK</strong>

Melffy Mommy and Melffy of the Forest are essential to keep this deck well-oiled. Ideally, with starting hand including Obedience Schooled, going OS into Melffy of the Forest is the go-to first play. Then, if Hide-and-Seek isn't in the starting hand, using Forest's effect to get it is the next move. Play H&amp;S, and if there's another Level 2 monster in your starting hand, you could always use it and the other monster summoned by OS to start Mommy, who at 5 materials becomes the ultimate attacker for the deck. Mommy has three stages; at 3 materials, she cannot be destroyed by battle. At 4, you take no battle damage from battles involving her. at 5, any attack position monster she's included in a battle against (whether she's in attack or defense position), her effect deals damage to your opponent equal to the opponent's monster's attack. This is the deck's boss monster and win condition, if successfully protected by H&amp;S and Mirror Force.

Secondarily, Number 64 is good for challenging heavy boards due to its ability to summon tokens with attack equal to the highest attack on the field, and Marjoram alongside Child's Play is a good way to clear cards on the field (once per turn) if Kalantosa isn't an option. Dark Mist is included for grins, but can come in handy in tight spots, as well as the other synchro monsters included in this build."

The house is on fire!!!,"<span>This is the first guid oa a deck written by my brother, being  his YCS remote duel SA choice. I hope you enjoy his guide as much as I do.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Eternal fire</b>

&nbsp;

<span>The almighty fire fiends of the great sacred tree are useful once again in this modern format . You can ask why or maybe how, and I will have answers for both questions . </span>

<span>First of all, basically every infernoid is a D. D. Crow, it means that there is no card in GY safe from being banished when these fiends hit the field . On top of that, the archetype’s big monsters can fully clean the field, monsters and back row.</span>

<span>Now, let’s go to how the deck functions and why I built it like that:</span>

&nbsp;

<span>MONSTER:</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span>I don’t want to set world on fire </span></i><span>crew:</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Antra, Harmadik and Patrulea</b><span> are here to serve as food to the bigger infernoids or for a quick answer to any threat in the field using </span><b>Decatron</b><span> . Antra bounces anything, Harmadik destroys one monster and Patrulea destroys one spell/trap, and also, they have the common quick effect of banishing any card in gy, only with a cost to tribute one monster in field (including themselves).</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Decatron</b><span> is here for a lot of reasons (pun with reasoning). Reason 1: </span><b>Reasoning</b><span> and </span><b>Monster Gate</b><span>, with these two cards you can mill almost fully deck  given space to play with almost all the other infernoids, and in the end finish with its summoning and mill the last infernoid that you need. Reason 2, is an excellent fist bait for any interactions that your opponent might have. Reason 3, with the trap </span><b>Void Feas</b><span>t, always has the chance to summon two of it and a Sjette or one of it and Seistema, in conclusion two of one mill on top of this action. Reason 4, Decatron gains the effect of any infernoid; that's awesome!! </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Sjette and Attondel</b><span> are here because I like them and they are good targets for Void Feast. That 's all.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Seistema</b><span> is strong for no reason. If it attacks it can banish a card without targeting at the end of the battle phase.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Onuncu and Devyaty</b><span>, the big Bosses. Onuncu is a dark hole on legs that negates and banishes spells/traps . Deviaty is a heavy storm on legs that negates and banishes monster’s effects.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Tierra</b><span> is the target for performing fusing using </span><b>Void Imagination</b><span> . Only in the process to summon it, the advantage gained is colossal because it is an instant mill of 6 infernoids . When she hits the field, her effect will gain even more advantage: mill 3 extra deck and top deck’s cards for each player (your opponent loses combo pieces and you can mill </span><b>Psy- Framelord Omega, Wind Pegasus @Ignister or Elder Entity N'Tss</b><span>) .</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span>Tools to set the world on fire </span></i>

&nbsp;

<b>Void Vanishment</b><span> is the search for any other void card and a set up for the Void Feast.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Void Feast </b><span>is a really cool tool, because If you have two of it and another void trap/spell, you could activate the fist one to send a void trap/spell to the Gy and activate the second send the fist Void Feast, getting the two of them resolving.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Void Imagination</b><span> lowers the level of every infernoid to one  with the downside that your opponent will receive half of damage. With that you can continue summon infernoids without worrying about the total level count on the field. However,the real good use is to summon Tierra from your extra deck using 6 monsters from your deck, if your opponent controls a monster special summoned from the extra deck. That’s a set up, follow up and a body with a lot of effects on the field.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Void apocalipse</b><span> is a good card to set up your GY with infernoids that you may need.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span>The fire is good, but I thing it’s missing some Darkness</span></i>

&nbsp;

<b>The lair of Darkness package</b><span> is here to give the cost of any infernoid to the opponent. The Field spell itself is for that, bypassing even dragoon protection. Ahrima is here to search the field spell and to possibly bring the Diabolos, a very good monster to deal with. Beat Cop is here to tribute an opponent’s monsters and give protection to the field spell.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span>Psych tricks and magic tricks are also good </span></i>

&nbsp;

<b>The PSY-Framegear Gamma package</b><span> is here to give a chance to interrupt your opponent in his turn without breaking the consistency with reasoning and monster gate. Also PSY-Framelord Omega can be used in rare synchro plays and with Tierra, if he gets milled.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Reasoning and Monster Gate are here to mill the deck, only. One for one, bring fast the Decatron. And the Pot of Extravagance is a pot of greed in this deck.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span>For the extra deck,staring:</span></i>

&nbsp;

<b>Wee Witch's Apprentice and Duelittle Chimera</b><span> to give that little atack boost for an otk.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Crusadia Equimax</b><span> for a big beat stick.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Gravity Controller</b><span> is a fun one. With Tierra on the field, because it’s level is 11 your play with infernoid should stop right there, but with him, won’t. That’s because Tierra  can be used as material to summon him, leaving the level count on the field equal zero.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Wind Pegasus @Ignister and Elder Entity N'Tss</b><span> can be sent to GY by Tierra. There Elder Entity N'Tss can destroy what you want and Wind Pegasus @Ignistertarget  can  target 1 card your opponent controls; shuffle it into the Deck if any monster gets destroyed.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Relinquished Anima </b><span>can steal one of your opponent's monsters if Deactron gets negated but not destroyed.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span> The side</span></i>

&nbsp;

IT'S A CUTE BIRB. DO YOU NEED ANY MORE REASON?,"Annoy the heck out of your opponent by 'normal' summoning one million times per turn and completely stop them from doing anything at all.

Note that if you play this deck, you run the risk of your opponent surrendering before you even finish your combo. No, it's that long. They just realize that they have no chance to win against these birbs, either that or it just flew right over their head. On the off chance that your opponent didn't surrender after seeing your monstrous birb, however, you can shut down their play with your floodgates and then peck them to death.

Jokes aside, the birbs are VERY cute, and this deck is pretty impeckkable. Try it out.

IMPORTANT: You absolutely need Lucky Straight in your extra deck. He will watch over you and make sure you don't brick your hand."

When that happens, all your D-HERO monsters will be indestructible by card effects and battle. Also, you'll take no damage in battle that involves D-HERO monsters.

With that said, activate Disk Commander in chain 1 + Denial in Chain 2. With Denial's effect, put Plasma on top of your deck.

With Disk commander's effect, you draw 2 cards.

You can also let Drawhand join the field party and allow it to make each duelist draw a card if you have a Droll &amp; Lock Bird in hands. This is the cherry on top.

There you have it. Indestructible monsters on the field ready to be tributed for plasma on your next turn."
