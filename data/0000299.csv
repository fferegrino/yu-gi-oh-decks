Why not, we are going to annoy the meta decks","This deck, for the June/2022 Master Duel format, is designed to take advantage of the control offered by the Sky Striker archetype, combined with the powerful control and versatility of the Time Thief cards [my favorite archetype], which with the extra of the D.P.E combo being the icing on the cake, it ends up achieving great control and versatility to surpass many decks in the current meta. And although it seems that the sky striker does not get along with other archetypes, but the ability of Time Thief Redoer and D.P.E to leave the field and provide advantages with said effect, in the end it gives him a power to say the least ""funny"" (so least for us) to the classic Sky Striker deck."

There are alot of combos between these two archetypes. More than I could represent here.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>[Darklord combo]</span></strong>  The best way and the main way for the deck to get big beatsticks on the Board. The main way to get Darklords on the Board is to find a way to get them to the grave. This is extremly simple due to there effects. Everything you need for one combo is Ixchel and one Darklord card. (preferebly Superbia) By discarding Ixchel and another Darklord card you'll be able to draw 2 cards. With Darklord Contact or Banishment of the Darklords you will be able to summon those two Cards back on the Field to either use them for a link summon or a fusion summon. Nearly every Darklord has a second effect you can pay 1000 lp to activate a darklord card from your graveyard. Nearly every Darklord card works like Ixchel and therefor its extremly easy to have 4 or more monsters on the Field at once.  <strong><span>[Despia combo]</span></strong>  The Despia Cards work as a support for the Darlord cards. With Aluber you will be able to get the Despia Fusion spell with which you will be able to summon the Darklord or despia Fusion monsters.  <span><strong>[Fusion Monsters]</strong></span>  The First Darklord has a special effect that triggers when you summon him with darlord Morningstar as Material. You will be able to destroy every card your oponnent controls. And your opponnent can't really counter this effect because The First Darlord makes it so that Fairy monsters can't be targeted for effects.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

Unlike many other of my decks this one had thought put into it (lol, I used to just make Mashup decks on a rainy ay cause I'd nothing better to do). Now I, like most duelists, have mixed feelings about POTE, because, though I always love new cards and new formats, Splights &amp; Tearlaments are extremely powercreepy &amp; Splights might even tiptoe towards Tier Zero (and once the Ishizu cards come out the same could be true for Tears).  But like the old saying goes, if you can't beat 'em join 'em. So if you can't beat Tearlaments, join Tearlaments (go to hell Splights).  This deck should be fairly recognizable. Humble Branded Despia players will know the combo so I'm pretty sure I don't have to sit here and say ""Use Branded Fusion to send Albaz &amp; Tragedy...""  However I should explain Darklords, &amp; with that explanation comes me telling you that typically your to NOT (when using this deck in particular) send Trag with Branded Fusion, instead you'll be sending Archlord Kristya to make Albion, then with Albion make Mirrorjade. See Darklords is just an engine to make The First Darklord, which has a effect to reborn your dumped Kristya to lock your opponent from specialing.  This should be an easy concept to grasp. And though the deck sometimes won't have a god hand and won't be able to make The First Darklord to sum Kristya, it will still be able to use not only Despian &amp; Albaz cards but also Tears in order to hold down the fort.  Darklord Ixchel should ideally send itself along with Darklord Superbia to draw 2, then later revive Superbia with Darklord Contact. Superbia summons another Fairy, all to get you the materials to make The First Darklord,(your fusion card being the Despian Field) or Condemned Darklord. Like I said sometimes your hand won't be able to make The first darklord, but you still might have a draw 2 &amp; don't forget your friends the Tearlaments!  I admit I'm not yet a Tears master, but I expect those of you aspire to be know at least the basic combos. The field gets you the one you normal summon, and you use that to dump then fuse. The Tears effects, along with Tragedy's, can be triggered by Branded opening, so if you send trag you can grab Ad Libitum or Aluber to do the Mirrorjade+Chimera play, and if you send a Tear you can fuse.  The deck can brick but many times won't. The ratios seemed right to me &amp; work but if you try this out feel free to do whatever, like add a third Despian Field to make it easier to go into the first darklord. Side deck customizable, I just put in stuff.  If you have questions I'll try to answer, if you have suggestions I'll gladly consider, and if you have a comment it's okay to let it out. Pls enjoy &amp; make this deck better any way you can.  &nbsp;"

The Dragunity Couse can be used for both a level 4 and a level 6 synchro monster, for a level 6 synchro, you recommend<a data-name=""Gaia Knight, The Force of Earth""> Gaia Knight, The Force of Earth</a>, <a data-name=""Powered Inzektron"">Powered Inzektron</a> or <a data-name=""HTS Psyhemuth"">HTS Psyhemuth</a>. Gaia Knight has the highest attack of all the level 6 synchro cards that you can summon, 2600, which can be useful as Spright's biggest weakness are low attack points. <a data-name=""Powered Inzektron"">Powered Inzektron</a> has also got a high attack (2500) but also has self protection and gives you battle protection, though the synchro line is mainly used on turn 2/3+. <a data-name=""HTS Psyhemuth"">HTS Psyhemuth</a> is a card which is essentially a bigger <a data-name=""D.D.

For a level 4 synchro, theres only really 2 options in my opinion: <a data-name=""Old Entity Hastor"">Old Entity Hastor</a> and <a data-name=""Underworld Fighter Balrog"">Underworld Fighter Balrog</a>. <a data-name=""Hastor"">Hastor </a>is effectively a negate (but you need to link it off first) and then a change of heart but only after the monster <a data-name=""Hastor"">Hastor</a> is equipped to dies. <a data-name=""Balrog"">Balrog</a> is pretty big and also if its destroyed you get a free spright/frog revive.  <a data-name=""Instant Fusion"">Instant Fusion</a> and <a data-name=""Ready Fusion"">Ready Fusion</a> are both extenders into <a data-name=""Allvain The Essence of Vanity"">Allvain The Essence of Vanity</a>, a level 2 tuner for either <a data-name=""Halq"">Halq</a> or for <a data-name=""Spright"">Spright </a>extension.  This deck cannot summon <a data-name=""Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny"">Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny</a> but the reason it is in the deck is because of <a data-name=""Artemate Slay"">Artemate Slay</a> in the side deck as it not only turns into a free spin for a link monster on the field but it also turns into a pop if you add<a data-name=""Evil★Twin's Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la""> Evil★Twin's Ki-sikil &amp; Lil-la</a> into the main deck too which can then turn into a pseudo board wipe.  <a data-name=""Codebreaker Virus Swordsman"">Codebreaker Virus Swordsman</a> is only here because its the biggest link 2  <a data-name=""Pitknight Earlie"">Pitknight Earlie</a> is an interesting card, if you have a <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a>, <a data-name=""Spright Elf"">Spright Elf</a> and this card on board with Pitknight Earlie pointing to Spright Elf, the Toadally awesome serves as negate 1 and the revive from Spright Elf actually serves as a negate as well because Earlie points to Elf and (with Toad back) we now have a 3rd negate!"

I feel this version is much better than the metalcruncher version, because it gives you the same tools as the cruncher version except with more options for felxibility and power. This version is just as good when playing thru hand traps but offers more powerful end boards and follow up.  This version can easily fit 12 - 15 handtraps/tech cards if you cut 1 forward and the revolving switchyard package and play 40-44 cards. I like having the switchyard and extra derricane bc it leads to more chances to end on lvl 10xyz and also regulus negate. When you draw a lvl 10 it also leads to getting regulus bc then you can search it with river stromer.  The deck is very complexed and has some of the most power when it comes to turn 3/ follow up plays, and board breaking. If you learn this deck inside out it can be an extremly powerful deck. It also currently not a target of any banlist threats."

But let's be honest, U.A's are 2 or 3 powerful cards away from being somewhat competitive. They have Omni Negates, Disruption, and the Power to hang with some decks. They just lack consistency and a Boss Monster. Hopefully the version I have made will fix that. By using U.A Signing Deal and U.A Hyper Stadium, you can easily flood the field with 2 or move Level 5 warrior monster to summon Idaten. By using Ultra Poly, not only can the summon not be negated, you can also special summon the monsters used for the summon back to your field. Their effects are negated but U.A's gimmick is swapping other U.A's out and special summoning others U.A's. Essentially, all you need to do is tag them out and tag them back in with their effects active.  The version I have made is budget, so obviously you can swap out cheaper cards with more expensive if you are willing to invest which would make the deck even more powerful.

There are no good reprints and playing pure Dark World just gives headaches.</strong> There are 6 archetypes in this deck to solve problems. It's still weak against common anti-meta trends. The underlying idea of this deck is to have many routes and ways to play. Feel free to add more cards like Adventurer, Shaddoll Schism and That Grass Looks Greener. *Tearalaments Kaleidoheart is a Fiend &nbsp; The current Dark World (pre-release) is full of weaknesses and bricks that Konami will not cover, and likely nothing can be done anymore. &nbsp; <strong>Some explanation for the card of choice in the deck list:</strong> Tri-brigade Mercourier - Though a dead card on its own, quite useful if you need a continuation by banishing it with Dark World Ascension. Zombie Vampire - One of my favourite Rank 8 cards. It provides continuation play when needed, helps Masquerades abuse 2nd effect and also can be summoned by using your opponent's stolen card as xyz material. Tearlaments Salic - A Tearalments searcher that doubles as a negate. Not better than the Tearalments' field card on your hand, but when can be good if you just need a discard or you can't find other ways for using Foolish Burial Goods Toy parade - Can be searched out after using Edge Imp Chain as a discard for Dark World Ascension, and used it on the 3200 Atk Grapha Branded Banishment - A super polymerization that banishes and gives a free GY special summon. <strong>Some explanations on why some cards are not in the deck:</strong> Tearalments Shaylen - at times it can be more dead than Mercourier on your hand, but you can add if you want to Dark World Supports(Library, Genta, Gates of Dark world) - They aren't that good in a pure Dark World Deck and will just be even more useless once you start mixing archetypes. Ash/Maxx ""C""/Imperm - Unless you need them, if not, they will drag you down <strong>Other ideas</strong> Triple T/Dark Ruler no more/Forbidden Droplet - generic supports that can help solve more situations Reducing card counts to 40 plus - take out 1 Reign-beaux, Cartesia, Bigfoot, Edge Imp archetype and Shaddoll Archetype, and you should be able to reach 40ish card count Fun Ideas for Dark World - Double Resonator and Ultimatl Bishbaalkin</p>"

They are very consistent due to their 1 card combos using <strong>Dark Beckoning Beast, Piri Reis Map, or Opening of the Spirit Gates</strong>. <strong>That's 9 starters 1 card starters!</strong> Sacred Beast alone can get out of hand if you can establish a bored due to their ability to swarm the field and make big monsters for very little. Byssted are here for several reasons. For starters, they work around having Dark or Light monsters in either GY and Sacred Beasts do a great job at getting that done. Them being low levels and having <strong>0 ATK/DEF</strong> means that even in the worst situations, you can Normal Summon one, make <strong>Almiraj</strong> or <strong>Linkuriboh</strong> and then banish the Sacred Beast for a Byssted monster. Byssted also act as D.D. Crows when your opponent controls a monster which gives Sacred Beasts needed interruption vs most decks. All Byssted monsters are 2500 ATK meaning at the very least, they act as pretty strong beatsticks with a chance to disrupt your opponent or stall out. Sacred Beasts have more synergy outside of just being fodder for Byssted. They can also bring back their continuous spell, <strong>Rebranded </strong>with <strong>Opening of the Spirit Gates</strong>. They can also bring back their continuous trap, <strong>Branded Beast</strong> if we choose to <strong>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts</strong>. Sacred Beasts also have banish effects and since we run 1 of the 2 that do use banish effects, we can make great use out of Rebranded for recycling and getting us a draw. Rebranded even lets us recycle our Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder by banishing it with a Byssted effect and then returning it to the deck to be searched later by any of our searchers.  <span>Why so many hand traps?</span>  You may be asking yourself at this point, ""<em>why are there 15 hand traps,</em> isn't that bricky?"" Well, yes and no. This deck looks to go second but can go first due to needing only 1 card to get the bare minimum started. Going second with this many hand traps means that 8/10, you will either completely stop your opponent in their tracks with how many ways you can screw them or severely limit what they can do and all you need is 1 card to get started.  <span>Goals of this deck.</span> <ul>  	<li>Be fun</li>  	<li>Be consistent</li>  	<li>Be flexible</li>  	<li>Include a Sacred Beast along with their specific support card</li>  	<li>Be competent to some extent</li> </ul> <span>Hands you are looking for ranging from best to worst case!</span>  1 Hand Trap + The Byssted Lubellion + any 2 of the combination of Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates or 1 of the previous searchers + Chaos Summoning Beast/Dark Summoning Beast + Cerulean Skyfire  3 Hand Traps + The Byssted Lubellion + Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates  3 Hand Traps + A Byssted Monster + Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates  4 Hand Traps + Dark Beckoning Beast/Piri Reis Map/Opening of the Spirit Gates  4 Hand Traps + The Byssted Lubellion  4 Hand Traps + A Byssted Monster  5 Hand Traps  No Hand Traps, No Starters, No Byssted Monsters  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://imgur.com/a/wwCNuME""><span>Combos!</span></a>  <span>Cards we don't run and why...</span> <ul>  	<li><strong>The Byssted Alba Los</strong> - It is a hard minus for an OK reward. Being able to basically screw over Rituals and all Extra Deck monsters besides Pendulums is pretty cool but we do not run a big enough Byssted package for it and most times, it is either a brick or seen too late. Even with all the draw power we can generate.</li>  	<li><strong>Awakening of the Sacred Beasts</strong> - While it does help us get back our 1 Branded Beast if it gets popped, it just doesn't do enough for us. The Skill Drain effect is really good but hard to achieve and requires us to run bricks to do so. In most cases, we can make enough negates and have enough hand traps that we don't need this card. The heal effect is also quite nice but can be anti-synergistic for our Map&gt;Heatsoul route in rare cases.</li>  	<li><strong>Raviel, Lord of Phantasms</strong> - This guy is pretty cool but has several reasons why Hamon was picked over him. First off, he requires 3 Fiend Monsters unlike Hamon, which requires 3 Continuous Spell Cards or just any Face-Down Spell Cards if you control Cerulean Skyfire which means you have a much higher chance of getting him out. There is a combo that you can do that uses News Reporter from the Underworld to have 3 Fiends but even then its not worth it because of the next reason. Raviel's specialty card, Raviel, Lord of Phantasms - Shimmering Scraper has more looser summoning conditions, requiring only 3 Monsters instead of Fiend Monsters but even then, it doesn't act as the original Raviel. It's effect can allow up to OTK with Raviel and it's revival effect is great for triggering Byssted Druidwurm or Saronir similar to the original Raviel's effect. Hamon's specialty card is a spell/trap negate that can stop cards like Super-Poly [the bane of this deck's existence] and Forbidden Droplet due to it being a continuous effect and a spell card instead of a monster. It is also a continuous spell so it can discarded by Opening of the Spirit Gates and added back so long as you have a level 10 monster on the field meaning you get a free summon.</li>  	<li><strong>Uria, Lord of Searing Flames</strong> - Weakest of the 3 Sacred Beasts. Even it's specialty card, Hyper Blaze is subpar at best due to it simply being an ATK booster for each Face-Up trap on your field or your GY. The destruction effect of Uria is also quite dated, only being able to target SET spell/trap cards but at least your opponent cannot respond to it. Overall, its almost never worth going this card unless you are running a trap variant and even then, I would consider other options.</li> </ul>"

The theory behind this deck was a simple one. I really enjoyed Prank-Kids and was sad to see Cat go. Unfortunately, now the biggest issue is getting the engine going, which is why the Invoked engine makes it even better.  The deck now has 5 searchable poly methods, a combo I was doing was Invocation two Prank-Kids (Rocksies was an MVP) and banish Aleister with the Rocksies, then Invo effect grab back your Aleister and then proceed to combo.  I came up against meta decks such as Punk Synchro, Adventure, etc and the deck performed well. A lot of meta decks cannot function after a full board wipe this format.  The side deck was a choice for my locals and did well, as I cannot take advantage on too many handtraps, I dedicated the deck to going first (hopefully) and setting up my board and then siding for the next games. I put DPE in as it is a draw 2, a free summon off dasher for your Prank Kids and DPE is still a strong card.  I was ended games with Mechaba, Toad, DPE with full Battle Butler and follow up."

I personally think the deck is pretty good as is, but there are some changes you can make depending on preference. There are some weird ratios in the deck for some things but i’ll go over everything in this deck explanation. If something abt the card ratios/uses doesn't make sense, read the combo and it might help! We dragon players need to keep this format alive, it shouldn’t just be a boring tear and splight meta. Dragons best deck!!</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 Abs - used to mill off of ravine to search in combo, extender if drawn and can also just be discarded to use effect and ravine can mill destrudo </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 destrudo - amazing extender, and it’s a tuner for halq plays potentially </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 white - free 2 bodies w/black and w/o normal summoning, and can be hit off of ruler since it’s light and chaos space can easily search, easily one of the best cards in the deck</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 black - same as white, just isn't as good when you draw because you need to banish a light from gy, which is very possible but not as easy/flexible as white in some scenarios </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 illusion - can search souls and can be searched off of chaos space or hit off of ruler </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 souls - can be searched off of illusion or ruler, no need for any more than 1-1 ratio, it’s only really good if the brave engine is active </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 snow - mill of of riser, amazing card and great when drawn as well since riser can mill temple for follow up and you have an extra extender + free discard </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 ze amin - to summon off of e-tele, card’s crazy - even if you draw it it’s good except you can’t use brave that turn</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 foxy tune - you search off of amin and discard self + blank to summon deer note and go into ruler early, if you draw, it’s a free summon and a discard at worst</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 deer note - for punk combo, not a good draw, but if you draw with e-tele, you can do the e-tele summon amin, amin search foxy and then deer note discard foxy to summon itself and in this case it’s the same as not opening deer note and using foxy effect normally (same number of cards used in hand)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 ghost ogre - extra card to summon off of e-tele (playing this since it’s level 3), it’s a handtrap when draw and not maximizing on it this format because there’s better handtraps to run imo</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 red rose - main halq target, cards crazy with brave or any level 4 non tuner</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 rox rose - target for red rose effect, if drawn it’s a “dragon starter” aka way to get to romulus. You can also discard it and summon it off of pisty later to use its effect. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 temple - searches brave engine and a free body if you already have access to the brave engine, it’s follow up when in the grave and it’s nice that you can use effect from grave as well since you may mill it using ruler </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 gryphon - you need this for the brave engine, helps you go nibiru proof and it’s a level 7 that can be used in the combo along with red rose to summon out fleur. Not a brick if you draw it, if you have brave engine already, you can search temple with fateful and you have a free body + follow up, and if you draw without rite, it’s still a free body and it can also be used to summon romulus since it’s a winged beast (a lot of ppl usually forget this, but romulus can take dragons and/or winged beast monsters as materials!!)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>2 tracer - best rokket in the deck, summons from deck and helps you use snow effect twice during opponent's turn. Great draw, since it’s a tuner and helps extend combo if drawn as well since you usually need to search this</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 synchron - nice in the late game as a normal summon, otherwise it’s there for hot red plays</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 recharger - best level 4 rokket, pairs nicely with striker dragon, being able to bring back any dark from grave is powerful in the late game, especially when your opponent breaks your board</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 ash blossom - most generic handtrap that’s always good (and it’s a level 3 tuner, which just works in this deck)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 nibiru - it’s a light and a really high impact handtrap that is especially good this format with all the combo decks</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 gamma - if you resolve this card in your turn, you pretty much win the duel, -1 from opponents hand (the ash they used that’s negated), free ruler, which means free mill 4 and add 1, and ruler can bring itself back from graveyard as well. If you resolve this card, you're at such an advantage you almost always just win, unless your opponent opens crazy. Can protect when you use : chaos space, e-tele, quick launch and temple</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 driver - best card in the entire deck, what else can I say?</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 galaxy cyclone - this is kinda weird, but i lose 2-1 to mystic mine decks so much this format, so i feel like it’s worth maining this just so you don't auto lose this matchup if dracoback has already been used. Playing this specifically because it’s nice when you mill it off of ruler and use it rather than having harpie’s in the main deck and praying you draw it. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 rite - amazing starter and works wonders with the red rose engine </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 fateful - not amazing when you draw this, but it’s not half bad. When you open with rite, it’s a -1, not the end of the world, but if you open it normally, you can search temple and get token + dracoback which isn't half bad. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 dracoback - this card’s crazy going second and it’s a free discard going first, main deck out to mine as well, not a great draw most of the time</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 e-tele - it’s a free ruler + halq when you summon ze-amin, and helps dig for the brave engine when you don't open it and extends the combo (since you don't need to use tracer + recharger to go into ruler, you can go straight for savage and potentially end on an extra hot red). When you already used ze-amin or you draw it in the late game, it can summon gamma as a body/tuner or ghost ogre as a level 3 tuner (this is important in this deck)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 quick launch - it’s a free dragon, rokket synchron, level 4 body, tuner or tracer: whichever you want it to be at that moment </span>  &nbsp;  <span>3 chaos space - this card’s crazy, gives a ton of card advantage and is just value in general. It gets you 2 free summons, recycles striker, and draws you a card, what more can you ask for? Can also search illusion by discarding a light (:</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 boot: for combo, not a great draw, you just won't search it </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 ravine: for combo, again, you will search so not the best draw, but at least it does something when you draw it unlike cough cough boot cough cough</span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 foolish - this card is whatever you want it to be, brave engine, tracer (via abs), tuner (destrudo) or even snow </span>  &nbsp;  <span>1 basal rose shoot: another combo card, not the best draw by interesting thing is, when you search it off of rox, you can set it instead of using it and it helps you play around dark ruler (dark ruler c1, basal c2, hot red c3 on dark ruler)</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Main combo (a way to make halq + brave engine) - </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Note</span><span>: I’ll be using souls + ash blossom + rite but it can literally be anything else here. Having souls is kind of a bonus, it can be any random monster in it’s place </span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Use rite, summon token grab fateful</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Normal ash, fateful grab draco</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Fateful eff, search gryphon and then disc draco</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Draco equip onto token</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Gryphon summon itself out (make sure you use the rightmost 2 zones or leftmost 2 zones, just to be safe, don't play the brave stuff in the middle zones so you have guardragon plays if halq gets negated)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Souls dump illusion, to summon itself</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Souls send fateful and draco to draw 2, free cash money</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Souls + ash into halq, summon red rose </span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Red rose + gryphon into fleur (dont summon in the middle, stick to one side)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Red rose summon rox rose</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Rox rose grab basal</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Rox + token into riser, use eff to dump snow</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Riser into striker (right arrow of halq, also riser is level 3 now so this is legal), grab boot</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Basal summon red rose, red rose into pisty (left halq arrow)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Pisty bring back something</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Pisty + something into romulus, grab ravine</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ravine discard mill abs search tracer</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Boot summon tracer</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Tracer pop boot summon recharger</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Tracer + recharger into ruler, mill and add</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Romulus + halq + ruler into borrend (summon into zone striker points to instead of extra monster zone, we do this so when we summon unicorn into extra monster zone in opponents turn, we get an extra draw since it’s co linked to borrelend!)</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Striker destroy itself, add recharger, recharger effect, summon itself back</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Borrelend target recharger and summon back tracer from gy</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Tracer + recharger into savage, eff to equip halq</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Now if you have an extender in hand, you can make I:P (if it’s just any random body this works) or hot red (if you have quick launch) since you have ruler in grave as the second body for these effects</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Opponents turn, we have borrelend (negate and summon back tracer), fleur (omni negate), savage (omni negate), snow set x2 (summon, then tracer eff to pop it and then snow again - can’t use if you already used synchron w/quick launch tho!) and potentially a handtrap you hit off of ruler effect. Make sure to always banish striker from gy (with ruler, snow or the chaos dragons) to recycle with chaos space for follow up! This is the basic gist of it, ending on multiple negates and amazing follow up with flexible combo pieces. </span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>Nibiru</span><span>: In this combo, you are immune to nib the entire time, having gryphon or bleur on board at all times. If your opponent has nib, they will use it to force out the gryphon negate (the ideal time is when there’s halq, red rose, gryphon and token on board, if they let you resolve red rose, there’s no point in dropping nib, because it trades with fluer, which till stays on board and can do stuff next turn and lets red rose resolve which is too much card advantage). If they do this, you still do the same combo, except you don't have gryphon, which means no fleur in the end board (oh no! One negate’s gone!). When you don't have brave engine, you can do the same combo here, except pretend the brave token is a level 4 body (literally anything from chaos dragons to snow to recharger that you summoned with quick launch) and do the combo normally. You just won't have fleur in the end board. Be mindful though! Dont just fullsend your resources in this combo right away and get punished by nib, because you are not protected here. You can do this after you made riser and used red rose effect though, because your opponent would have dropped nib by now if they had it. The nib proof version and this version lose to impem/veiler + nib though so that's something to keep in mind. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Punk Stuff (most ppl alr know how this engine works but i’ll explain anyways)</span>  &nbsp; <ol>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>E-tele out ze-amin</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Amin search foxy</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Foxy discard itself and blank to summon deer note</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Synchro into ruler, deer note bring back ze-amin</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Mill 5 add 1</span></li>  	<li aria-level=""1""><span>Ruler + amin into halq</span></li> </ol> &nbsp;  <span>This engine helps extend the regular combo and helps you dig for temple/brave engine. In the main combo, if you opened this instead of the souls + normal summon, you can go directly into savage instead of ruler, then you can summon out I:P as well, so this helps extend the combo. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Extra dec</span><span>k: Most of the stuff in extra is used in combo, except for dharc, triple burst and accesscode. The only reason I don't play seal is because it doesn't come up as often as dharc or triple burst. Triple burst is amazing when you don't have striker + pisty to make guardragon plays. It comes up a LOT and some people are using it instead of hot red in the extra. I was doing this as well, but I feel like hot red is necessary for this meta with all the mystic mine and spell stuff going around. Dharc also does come up going second and I just found myself using it more than seal. In the end, it’s based on preference, you can pick 3 out of these 4, dharc, seal, triple burst and hot red. If I had a 16 card extra, i’d definitely play all of them, but in the end there is no wrong answer as to what you pick, I’ve seen ppl run all combinations of those cards. </span>  &nbsp;  <span>Changes I’d make</span><span>: if you are a normal human being (couldn't be me haha) you’d play 51 cards with 3 droplet instead of the galaxy and ogre</span>  &nbsp;  <span>Well, thats basically all I have to say, if there are any questions lmk in the comments, I’ll try to answer them asap (been kinda busy lately tho so idk). Send mea friend request on disc with any questions (Ash_001#9275). Anyways thanks for reading if your still here lol this took quite a bit to type out. </span>"

You can also run pot of prosperity if you so desire however that is a very expensive card and it increases the deck size so it'll be harder to open a good hand. P.S this deck is for fun only it is not for really competitive play.

My best end was Cicada King, Apollousa and Atlas which is pretty good for this deck.  Also, it's fine if you draw Mantis which is hillarious since you will mostly  equip it with Picofalena.  Deck is fine and it's best Insect deck out there. It is Rogue and can fight the best decks and come out victorious."

I like Danger! Dark World decks as much as the next person, but I also like to have a field spell that actually works when I send a Danger! monster to the graveyard as well. This deck is by no means perfect. I'm still trying to get use to making decks with newer cards (in other words I'm only really good at making decks from the GX era).

There are multiple engines / packages running in the main deck that all contribute to each-other including The Magicians', Palladium, and Timaeus The United Dragon Package; The Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package; The Kuriboh Brothers Package;  The Red-Eyes Package; The Blue-Eyes Package; and The Legendary Dragons Package. (Disclaimer: Many staples were left out to focus on cards that can contribute to each-others' engines').  The deck tends to run on its own depending on opening hand. Ideally the Kuriboh Brothers are used as the main line of Defense while the Magician/Dragon Knight board gets built though any of the other engines can pick up steam quickly largely due to how light they are. The Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package is a very light and versatile package that continually recycles itself back into the deck and synergies with any discard cost in addition to providing material for Dark Cavalry, Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and for either Jack's Knight or Joker's Knight to be used as tribute for Five Star Twilight. The Red-Eyes Package stands on its own with Red-Eyes Fusion to go into Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon while Red-Eyes Baby Dragon helps serve as a bridge to either access the Black Stone of Legend OR The White Stone of Ancients (When making Red-Eyes Slash Dragon with Red-Eyes Fusion ideally it is best to use Joker's Knight as the Warrior material to set up a possible bounce back to the hand once another Light Warrior hits the graveyard. All Warrior monsters in the main deck are Light Warrior monsters). The Blue-Eyes Package is also a very light package (2 card package) that helps serve as material for any of the Dragon Knight fusion forms on top of being able to make Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon (All Dragons in the deck also increase the probability of making a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword through The Claw of Hermos).  Lastly, The Legendary Dragon's Package consists of all three Legendary Dragon spells (The Claw of Hermos, the Eyes of Timaeus, and the Fang of Critias) running in the main deck as optimized as possible. The main deck runs 10 Spellcaster monsters, 7 Dragon monsters, and 6 Warrior monsters (All are targets for the Claw of Hermos to build either a Time Magic Hammer, a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword, a Goddess Bow, or a Rocket Hermos. Time Magic Hammer and Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword possibly being the best 2 of the 4.) Though The Eye of Timaeus only has 2 targets in the whole deck (Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl) to make either of the Dragon Knight forms or Amulet Dragon, it has heavy synergy with most of the Dark Magician archetype in being searchable and in also being a target for Timaeus the United Dragon to be special summoned from hand.  Mirror Force, Crush Card Virus, Ring of Destruction and Tyrant Wing are all main decked for The Fang of Critias  and all of these Trap cards serve a double purpose in helping disrupt through their Trap Card activation OR by going into they Dragon Fusion forms. (Mirror Force is self explanatory, Crush Card Virus has a total of 11 targets that meet its activation requirements in the main deck, Ring of Destruction can easily disrupt an opponent's turn and Tyrant Wing has a total of 7 Dragon targets in the main deck (In addition to any of the other Dragons in the Extra Deck).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Deck Breakdown:  &nbsp;  The Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight Package: Joker's Knight package with King's, Queen's and Jack's Knight along with Joker's Straight and Imperial Bower. Both Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight during the End Phase can recur back to hand from the graveyard by returning 1 Light Warrior monster from the Graveyard into the deck. (Any Warrior from main deck can be returned from the graveyard into the deck to meet Joker's Knight or Joker's Straight recurring effect  because they are all Light Warrior's INCLUDING any of the Legendary Knights.)  Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear was recently added to contribute to the Joker's Package AND to also help Search Red-Eyes B. Dragon. (Giltia can also be used as tribute for Five Star Twilight along with Joker's Knight and Jack's Knight and can also be used for a Fusion summon fro Dark Cavalry and/or Red-Eyes Slash Dragon).  &nbsp;  Kuriboh Brothers Package: (Kuriboh Brothers including Kuribabylon with Five Star Twilight, Kuribohrn, Kuribandit, Magikuriboh, Skilled Brown Magician, Multiply, Detonate, and the Flue of Summoning Kuriboh). The Kuriboh's help search each other (Kuribahs' and Kuriboos' effect) along with helping search their own Spells/Traps (Kuribees' effect). Kuribandit, Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriborhn and Magikuriboh can all be brought out from the deck in several ways to assist in the duel  (Both Magikuriboh and Kuriborhn can be searched by Kuriboo's effect and be brought to hand and Kuribah's effect grants a special summon of any monster with 300ATK/200DEF onto the field after it or another Kuriboh monster on the field is destroyed by battle; All Kuriboh monsters in the deck are 300ATK/200DEF including Kuribohrn, Magikuriboh and Skilled Brown Magician). Kuribee's effect helps search any Spell/Trap with Kuriboh in its text (Five Star Twilight, Mulitply, The Flute oF Summoning Kuriboh, and Detonate are all searchable through Kuribee). Skilled Brown Magician serves multiple functions such as supporting the Kuriboh Brothers engine to even fusing with Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl into The Dark Magicians. Can also be used to make a Time Magic Hammer). Kuribandit is a VERY underestimated card. Kuribandit when normal summoned can be used as tribute during the End Phase to search the top 5 cards of the deck and add 1 Spell/Trap to the hand and send the remaining 4 to the graveyard. (Kuribandit works very well with Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight and adds any excavated Spell/Trap to the hand). Any of the DARK Kuribohs can also be used as tribute for Deck Devastation Virus.  &nbsp;  The Magicians, Palladiums, and Timaeus the United Dragon: Both Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are the main Fusion targets of the deck (Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are mainly to be used to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms. Magicians' Souls may just be the easiest way to bring either Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl out of the deck yet Palladium Oracle Mana and Palladium Oracle Mahad both provide another route to bring Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl onto the field. Apprentice Illusion Magician adds another way to search Dark Magician and be added to hand. Magician's Salvation helps bring search and set Eternal Soul onto the field at a faster rate. Magikuriboh can be searched and brought out to either the hand or field through Skilled Brown Magician, Kuriboo, and Kuribah (After battle or effect damage Makgikuriboh's hand effect can be triggered to bring out Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl from either deck or graveyard and can be recycled from graveyard back to hand whenever a face-up Spellcaster you control is destroyed by battle or card effect. Timaeus the United Dragon can be special summoned from the hand by sending any Spell/Trap that mentions ""Dark Magician"" (A vast majority of Spells in the deck mention Dark Magician) is there to help get into any of the the Dragon Knight fusion forms through contact fusion.  &nbsp;  The Red-Eyes Package: As long as Red-Eyes Fusion stays at least at 1 in the TCG the Red-Eyes Package provides a-lot of synergy to this deck. The Black Stone of Legend can be used to summon out Red Eye B. Dragon but most importantly it can be used to push Red-Eyes B. Dragon from the graveyard back into the deck to avoid Red-Eyes Fusion becoming a brick. Red-Eyes Fusion has two targets in the extra deck (Red-Eyes Slash Dragon and Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). If Red-Eyes Fusion is used to make Red-Eyes Slash Dragon ideally it is best to use Joker's Knight as the warrior fusion material because Joker's Knight can then be bounced back from the graveyard into the hand if there are any Light Warrior targets in the graveyard to recur Joker's Knight back to the hand. Red-Eyes Fusion can also be used to bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon (the most abused path in making Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon). Any of the Red-Eyes monsters also serve as additional targets for the Magicians to go into Dragon Knight fusion forms in addition to there being more targets for the Claw of Hermos to make a Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword.  &nbsp;  Keeper of Dragon Magic: Keeper of Dragon Magic adds any ""Fusion"" normal spell ""or ""Polymerization"" from deck to hand (targets are Red-Eyes Fusion or Fusion Deployment) and helps add ways to go into the Dragon Knight fusion forms OR Red-Eyes Slash Dragon or Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon AND can help bring back either Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, Red-Eyes B. Dragon, or Blue-Eyes White Dragon if any of them are in the graveyard as long as one of their fusion forms that lists one of them is in the Extra Deck when Keeper is normal/special summoned. Keeper of Dragon Magic also serves as another fusion target for any of the Dragon Knight fusion forms and Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon.  &nbsp;  Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear - Giltia is an easy last resort normal summon that can clear the field of a tank by banishing it through its normal summon effect. Since Giltia the D. Knight - Soul Spear is a Light Warrior, Giltia also meets both Joker's Knight and Joker's Straight bounce back-to-hand effects if either of them are in the graveyard. Giltia the D. Knight Soul Spear's effect also allows it to discard a card to be able to search a level 7 Dark Dragon Monster in deck to add to hand (Red-Eyes B. Dragon) and can also be used as fusion material to summon Red-Eyes Slash Dragon.  &nbsp;  Draw Power: Dark Magician Circle and Soul Servant serve as the main search/draw power cards of the deck. Even when Dark Magical Circle does not add a card to hand it helps set up a card for the next draw. Soul Servant at Max power can draw 4 cards and helps search nearly all of the cards in the Magicians' package including any of the Spellcasters (with exception to Skilled Brown Magician) inclusively Timaeus The United Dragon can be searched by Soul Servant as well.  Eternal Soul also helps thin the deck by searching out ""Dark Magic Attack"" and ""Thousand Knives"".  &nbsp;  The Legendary Dragons Package: Mirror Force, Ring of Destruction, Crush Card Virus and Tyrant Wing are strong disruption cards with a slight exception of Tyrant Wing. These Trap cards all serve a double purpose in helping disrupt through their Trap Card activation OR by going into they Dragon Fusion forms being Mirror Force Dragon, Destruction Dragon, Doom Virus Dragon and Tyrant Dragon by using The Fang of Critias. The Claw of Hermos serves like an equip spell toolbox depending on what Type of monster is used to make either Goddess Bow, Time Magic Hammer, Rocket Hermos Cannon, or Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword. The Eye of Timaeus helps The Magicians' Package in going into a Dragon Knight fusion form AND also increases Spell card targets for Timaeus the United Dragon to be special summoned.  &nbsp;  Fusion Deployment: Very simple yet very powerful card for any deck that focuses solely on a Fusion based extra deck. Fusion Deployment can be used to special summon Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, Red-Eyes B. Dragon, or Blue-Eyes White Dragon from the hand or deck since there are various targets in the Extra Deck that list them as fusion material.  &nbsp;  Polymerization - Allows a Fusion summon by using monsters from hand or field as fusion material. Adds additional ways to go into most of the Fusion Monsters in the Extra Deck in addition to Red-Eyes Fusion, Secrets of Dark Magic, Timaeus the United Dragon, and the Eye of Timaeus.  &nbsp;  Harpie's Feather Duster: The cream of the crop of staples. Destroys all spells and traps your opponent controls.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The Side deck can easily be any other cards though I find that Spiritual Swords of Revealing Light, Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning and surprisingly Berserker Soul can also be main decked without them diluting much of the synergy already going on in the main deck.  &nbsp;  Thank you for the interest! Please feel free to leave feedback!"

Cheers  -Exo  ( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtu.be/aSnTeZ_TZPk"">https://youtu.be/aSnTeZ_TZPk</a> )  &nbsp;  A dark age in Yu-Gi-Oh is coming as me and most of the playerbase has already known it. One way or another, the inevitable demise of the what was supposed to be a slow but smooth recovery turned into yet another avalanche of unexplained proportions. The existence of the newly created Spright archetype can easily create boards that don't have to rely on any special mechanics or anything unique or beyond the grand-scheme, such as its previous meta contenders that came before it and now. To that being said, the TCG variant is lucky enough to not really be as ""Tier 0"" as the OCG variants has made it out to be. However only time would tell if this is the came for where, and how Splight (Spright) truly stands as a competitive deck.  &nbsp;  For one reason I can say that this deck is an immediate success upon the release of POTE comes from how it can quickly (and fluently) build boards, set up a defensive wall for negations, and piece together an OTK versus other decks. However it doesn't mean that it isn't vulnerable to cards like <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a>, <a data-name=""Nibiru, The Primal Being"">Nibiru, The Primal Being</a>, and <a data-name=""PSY-FrameGear Gamma"">PSY-FrameGear Gamma</a>; but we in the TCG are also in the position to use a very particular card that was obscure for awhile, known as <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator </a>(basically <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a>, but you banish any card from your deck for said card to be negated instead of the GY). Before I go on to the XYZ monsters, there is a new Link-2 monster I have yet to mention in the Spright archetype that contributes the most to the board building and playing extensions: <a data-name=""Spright Elf"">Spright Elf</a> is a Link-2 monster that can special summon a Level 2 monster from your GY (or a Rank/Link-2 monster from your GY if your opponent controls a monster). Hence why <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"">Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax </a>was chosen here because of not only of the Synergy with <a data-name=""I:P Masquerina"">I:P Masquerina</a>; but also because it doesn't require <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> to banish important Link-2 monsters (like <a data-name=""Spright Elf"">Spright Elf</a>) to activate effects. Which in my opinion is a lot more resourceful for both sides than just banishing a link monster and trying to pop a card (on 4300 ATK) just to have it negated with any on field negate (or having your efforts decimated all together with <a data-name=""Solemn Strike"">Solemn Strike</a> if you didn't use<a data-name=""I:P Masquerina""> I:P Masquerina</a>).  &nbsp;  Finally the XYZ monsters that contributed on building the defensive structure that was necessary to further build boards and chip away at your opponents with less setbacks. While it may not come as a surprise to those who play Water base decks that take advantage of the familar XYZ monster, <a data-name=""Bahamut Shark"">Bahamut Shark</a>; <a data-name=""Toadally Awesome"">Toadally Awesome</a> is a Rank-2 Monster that negates anything by tributing a ""Frog"" monster (including itself), and recycles itself to be used later. The newest XYZ Monster, <a data-name=""Gigantic Spright"">Gigantic Spright</a>can be not only be XYZ summoned with using a Link-2 monster as well; but in doing so can get a multiplier in its base attack stat. For its features, <a data-name=""Gigantic Spright"">Gigantic Spright</a> can detach one XYZ material to special summon a Level 2 monster from the deck; but in doing so you can not Special Summon for the rest of the turn, except the aforementioned Level/Rank/Link-2 monsters (including your opponent). Finally comes <a data-name=""The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin"">The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin</a>, which is just infinite impermanence in form of a monster card; but could be a quick effect if I was able to put a Phantom Knights piece in here (however I would not recommend this for sanity sake).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

That's basically it, let's take advantage of Necrovalley being a pushed floodgate with lots of support, let's put up Gryphon Rider as often as possible, and lets see 2 HT as often as possible to really try and stop people's turns.

Some of these are good tuners that can help you put pressure on the board, but our real goal is just to not lost turn 1. I also wanted a full playset of Cosmic Cyclone.  After that, you want to see exactly 1 copy of Necrovalley, and you can run 5, so I'm running 5. Not much to say, this shuts down a lot of starters, extenders, and combo lines. We're just trying to floodgate people out with this card. It does conflict with Foolish Burial and Dracoback, so you can't mitigate the downside of Adventure as often on turn 2, and you need to know how to sequence Necrovalley, but even most idiots should be able to figure it out T1. It hurts almost every other deck more than ours anyways.  After that, you want all 5 of your Adventurer engine starters, but you also want 2 Adventure and 2 Gryphon Rider. Seeing these together puts up Grypon Rider, but mostly we're just running these so we aren't out of gas vs a single Cosmic or Ghost Ogre.  That left 5 slots. I felt like Called By was just too good to pass up in the deck, the card is very strong and close to an autoinclude. I also felt like raw card advantage would be pretty important for a stally stunny deck like this, and it really needs to see the Adventurer engine sooner rather than later. It also doesn't use the Extra Deck, so Pot of Extravagence makes sense.  The extra deck are mostly cards to make with your tuners, as well as cards to send vs Dogmatika Maximus. You should dip into this very often, but Baronne/Chengying is great to make with an unused Ash and Gryphon, and Omega/Draco Berserker is good to make with Gamma."
