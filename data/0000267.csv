And I decided to copy his play stile of the deck and combine it with the actual Dragon Rulers, and voilà, Floodgate Rulers.  I think, this would be the best way to play the Dragon Rulers in a pure version of the deck, if all came to 3 copies.  The side deck presents some accountable options, but can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day, everyone!"

A small Rokket package is included so that if you start with an above average hand, you can use <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> to search a <strong>Dragon Ravine</strong> to pitch an <strong>Absorouter Dragon</strong> to search a <strong>Rokket</strong> <strong>Tracer</strong>. By that point of the combo, you should have already gone into <strong>Striker Dragon</strong> for <strong>Boot Sector Launch</strong>. Only thing to do is to link off <strong>Dragunity Knight - Romulus</strong> and another Dragon into <strong>Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres</strong> to have a link in the GY for <strong>Borreload Savage Dragon</strong>.  Important thing to note with the deck are the Small World bridges. Only ones you super need to worry about are making sure the second card is a <strong>Black Metal Dragon</strong> or a <strong>Droll &amp; Lock Bird</strong> since that basically searches your entire deck."

Effectively, if you can summon 1 rank 4 + an extender, you have a board with 3-4 effect negates, 1 omni negate, 0-1 spell/trap negates, and 2 disruptions. It's gross, and super fun.  But, these builds struggle against any sort of interruption of your normal summon (ideally, this is regulator). That's why we run the gamma engine and called by. Is that enough to keep up with today's metagame? Absolutely not.  So, how to fix this? Take some inspiration from D/D/Ds and pendulum summon you some dark monsters to victory. We keep the deck super slim, running 4 spells and traps (all except 1 is searchable, how's that for consistency?). We also run Danger! Mothman to help unbrick your raider's wing/bezel ship, and Armageddon knight to dump one of those two after a pendulum summon (or normal + raider's wing). Even better, we have Curtain Raiser as a free special summon that can also be pendulum scaled with Supreme King Gate  When going second, they're probably going to s/t removal, so just get rid of the pendulums for some board breakers (which can include Forbidden Droplet/Lightning Storm, if you pay that much for cardboard). As an added bonus, D.D. crow is another dark winged beast, in addition to helping with scythe locks, this deck's worst enemy.  In the extra deck, the high level raidraptors can easily be subbed for abyss dweller/tornado dragon. Lambda can also be subbed for Omega, but searchable gamma is very nice.

This is an OTK deck that wants to Go Second, interrupt of break your opponent's first turn plays and run them over in turn 2.  The deck's main goal is to attack with a 6000 ATK <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a> with an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Goliath"">Infinitrack Goliath</a> as material, supported by <a data-name=""Outrigger Extension"">Outrigger Extension</a>, for an untargetable, undestructible OTK.  <a data-name=""Infinitrack Goliath"">Infinitrack Goliath</a> can be Link Summoned by tributing any 1 Infinitrack monster and can be sent to the graveyard to trigger its attach effect by either one of the Level 5 Main Deck monsters, any of the Xyz Infinitracks already in the GY, or by linking it up to a <a data-name=""Double Headed Anger Knuckle"">Double Headed Anger Knuckle</a>. You want to have a <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max</a> already summoned when you do this, something the whole deck is designed to turbo out in any way possible. Then you can Xyz Summon <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a> on top of the Gustav Max, activate its effect and attack for game. There are also a lot of handtraps and backrow removals to help you clear any inconveniences before you begin your plays.  <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> is here to help deal with the meta's most annoying turn-1 play, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>. Swordsouls always have a <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> on the field as well, our <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a> can use both of them as materials and is also Level 10. Despias have <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade the Blazing Dragon</a>, our <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> can use both of them (or another Despian if DPE is not on the field). <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a> is the only guy that can see <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> as material and is remotely possible to be Fusion Summoned. Even if you draw <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> and there are no valid plays with it though, it can either bait an opponent removal effect or be used as discard fodder for <a data-name=""Revolving Switchyard"">Revolving Switchyard</a>.  Note 1: Be aware that although <a data-name=""Outrigger Extension"">Outrigger Extension</a> is a great piece of support for your Xyz Machines, its Rank-Up effect restriction can lock you out of <a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a>, <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a> and <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. It can always be activated after these cards though, without problems. <a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a> has the same restriction on its search effect.  Note 2: There is a Side Deck section in this deck that lists a number of handtraps. These cards have all been tested and proven less useful against the meta, but they're still quite strong, and more importantly, they're quite strong against us. If you find yourself losing to any of them consistently, you can add a single copy of them into the deck as a target for <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a>.  <strong><span>May '22 Changelog</span></strong>  It's the <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> era, and we have to adapt to it. Also, Swordsoul and Despia decks are everywhere and they're annoying, so it's time someone punishes their hype. - <a data-name=""Ruffian Railcar"">Ruffian Railcar</a> and <a data-name=""Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede"">Flying Pegasus Railroad Stampede</a> have been removed from the deck. They are both too slow for the current format. Both ended up just serving as <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a> targets, but since neither can link into an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Goliath"">Infinitrack Goliath</a>, they were suboptimal even then. - <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> went up to 3. A better <a data-name=""Urgent Schedule"">Urgent Schedule</a> target that the two above, also its NS effect can become a lot more relevant due to other additions in the deck that block <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Super Express Bullet Train</a>'s self SS effect. It's now the second main NS of the deck. - <a data-name=""Night Express Knight"">Night Express Knight</a> cut down to 1. Takes up the NS of the turn, which is suboptimal and slows down the deck, also room was needed for more handtraps. Stayed to 1 instead of being removed completely because it's still a target for <a data-name=""Revolving Switchward"">Revolving Switchward</a> in a handtrap heavy opening hand that needs a way to trigger one of the other two Level 10 SS. - <a data-name=""Infinitruck Tunneler"">Infinitruck Tunneler</a> removed from the deck. It was the least useful Level 5 Infinitruck and the space was needed. - <a data-name=""Outrigger Extension"">Outrigger Extension</a> down to 1 and 3 <a data-name=""Heavy Forward"">Heavy Forward</a> added. Outrigger is searchable and its searcher is also searchable. Heavy Forward is 3 more <a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a>, or any other Infinitrack if you already have the short dude. - <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> have been removed from the deck. While still exceptionally good cards, I have noticed them impact less games less heavily in the current format. Also read ""Note 2"" for more on this. - 2 <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> added to the deck. These are mainly handtrap protection, they support the OTK capabilities of the deck immensely. <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> can also interrupt plays and remove <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a>, albeit after its destruction effect. <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> can block any card you happen to have in your deck, and since we also play a heavy amount of destruction spells, this is probably the most useful handtrap in the deck now. - 2 <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> added to the deck, along with 3 Fusion and 1 Link targets, <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a>, <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> and <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a>. This engine is the best board breaker of the current meta. Let's admit it, <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> is everywhere now. <a data-name=""Idaten the Conqueror Star"">Idaten the Conqueror Star</a> is the heavy lifter against Swordsouls, since they also go to a <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a>, he can use both of these as materials. <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> is the star against Despia and can also out the Enforcer in any deck that brings him with <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, since they're both Dark. <a data-name=""Earth Golem @Ignister"">Earth Golem @Ignister</a> coupled with <a data-name=""Salamangreat Almiraj"">Salamangreat Almiraj</a> can out any Link monster (I'm looking at you, <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess)</a>. Almiraj does need either a normal summoned <a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a> or a <a data-name=""Night Express Knight"">Night Express Knight</a>, so there goes the turn's NS. - 1 <a data-name=""Photon Strike Bounzer"">Photon Strike Bounzer</a> added to the Extra Deck. There will be a lot of times that you'll end up with both an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a> and an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Harvester"">Infinitrack Harvester</a> in the field. Using either of their on-field effects on the other can result in a Rank 6 play, and this dude can block a negate/destruction monster effect to help you get to <a data-name=""Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe"">Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe</a> easier. It does block <a data-name=""Super Express Bullet Train"">Super Express Bullet Train</a>'s ability to SS itself though, so keep that in mind (and hence 3 <a data-name=""Infinitrack Anchor Drill"">Infinitrack Anchor Drill</a>s now in deck). - Cyber Dragon engine removed from the Extra Deck and Infinitrack Goliath went down to 1. There are only 3 Level 5 Infinitrucks in the deck now, and our first Rank 5 play is always through an <a data-name=""Infinitrack Brutal Dozer"">Infinitrack Brutal Dozer</a> search that restricts us to Earth Machine monsters. It was rarely used and the room was needed. A second Goliath was also rarely used, and the deck can live without it if it already went through enough interruption to be able to use it. Again, room was needed."

Main strat is to summon one of these on the first turn by using cards like photon sanctuary or star blast and stall. This deck is not meant to be played in the tcg, and i only created this monstruosity to counter almost every deck in the game for free wins. This thing is nasty and i know it, so plz only comment cards that could be useful in the deck.  Time changed, and also the decklist got updated!!! The deck is 50 cards now, but it also has more nasty floodgates!! other good cards that u can add for more ""fun"" are Necrovalley, rivalry of warlords, evenly matched, macro cosmos, summon limit, lose 1 turn and mistake.  <hr />"

For full combos, watch: https://youtu.be/7l4tSsSC7DU","Subterror Behemoth Umastryx's effect is an optional effect (You Can) that starts with ""When"" which means it will miss activation if another event happens after ""When a face-up monster you control is flipped face-down"". Subterror Final Battle won't trigger Subterror Behemoth Umastryx's effect. Its text says ""Activate 1 of these effects, also, after that, Set this card face-down instead of sending it to the GY"". Because the text has ""after that"", another event is taking place after changing 1 face-up ""Subterror"" monster on the field to face-down Defense Position. The conjunctives ""then"" and ""also, after that"" indicate that the part of the effect before it is done strictly before the part of the effect after it, and so effects that could be activated in response to the event before the conjunctive miss the timing. On the other hand, the conjunctives ""<i>and</i>"", ""<i>and if you do</i>"" and ""<i>also</i>"" indicate that both the parts before and after it are done simultaneously. Therefore, no effect is taking place after it. You can use Subterror Guru &amp; Subterror Fiendess to trigger Subterror Behemoth Umastryx's effect.  Other trap card you can use is Ice Dragon's Prison.  https://youtu.be/7l4tSsSC7DU"

Imagine using an overpriced token engine with no DARK or more importantly LIGHT targets for a Fusion deck tha","Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back with another Branded list despite already posting a ton of it but because love this deck and I'm fucking sick and tired of people messing it the fuck up despite how hard it is to be bad at building a ""Super Poly the deck"" list and how straightforward of a deck it is to build despite being a Fusion toolbox deck. I hate redundancy, I despise it, but I hate seeing this deck be bastardized by questionable yet objectively terrible decisions even more.  <strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong>  • It can turbo out <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> without Verte or REF. Do I need to say more? • It can make DPE without Verte. Do I need to say even more? • It abuses <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a>. • It can survive without the Brave Token engine.  Before anything else, I wanna preface this with 1. There's being a good pilot and there's being a good deck builder, and that involves knowledge about what's in number 2, 2. Not because you can do what I'm about to warn you about in number 3, doesn't mean you should, and 3. <strong>DO NOT FUCKING PLAY THIS DECK WITH BRAVE TOKENS</strong>. I do not care if you see someone have a topping list that does otherwise, in theory it works great because ""hurr durr b-but free recurring omni negate opt"", but you know what does the job the same but better in practice? Fucking <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. Not to mention that you're doing yourself a disservice by using up 9 slots in your main deck for an engine, where 4 of which are monsters, and none of which are either LIGHT or DARK. I do not give a fuck if your favorite content creator tells you otherwise, I do not care if a list that uses it topped a BO1 event (any deck can so long as either they're lucky enough in the matchmaking, plays a silver bullet strategy, or uses tons of floodgates), I've been testing this deck since Despia and Albaz first came out and all I can guaran-fucking-tee you is <strong>THIS DECK NEEDS MORE LIGHT TARGETS, SO DO NOT KILL IT BY SPLASHING BRAVE TOKENS JUST BECAUSE OF THE FREE NEGATE</strong>. You can go test it out yourself but when you do, all I can say is have fun shooting yourself in the foot. Anyway, the list.  <strong>The Main Deck:</strong>  Monsters  <strong>• The Despians (<a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>, <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a>, <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a>, <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Comedy</a>)</strong> - Can't play the deck without them. Stuff they do: <ol>  	<li>Dramaturge - Main deck boss monster. Can recycle himself when sent to GY or is banished as Fusion material. Has a targeting negation effect when an Extra Deck monster is special summoned (not just from the Extra Deck). You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky.</li>  	<li>Ad Libitum - One of the reasons you can grind and recycle. This can bring back a banished <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> or <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> or in your GY upon getting sent to the GY or is banished as Fusion material. Also has an ok ATK boosting effect that can be relevant occasionally. You can play more than 1 but 3 can be bricky. You can recycle him with your Albaz Fusions anyway.</li>  	<li>Aluber - He's your main Normal Summon in the deck and THE REASON WHY YOU DO NOT PLAY THE GODDAMN BRAVE TOKENS IN THIS DECK BECAUSE IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO HIM. He also has a targeting negation effect in the GY when a Fusion monster you control is either destroyed by battle or leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect. I only play 2 because I already know how the deck plays but you can most certainly play 3 by cutting anything but the 1 ofs, except for <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Comedy"">Despian Comedy</a>.</li>  	<li>Tragedy - Playing 3 of this enables you to play draw cards like Allure of Darkness. I do not understand why people only play 1 of this considering how this is your main searcher. I don't recommend cutting this.</li>  	<li>Comedy - Utility 1 of. Archetypal hand trap to protect your Despia monsters from targeting effects, also allows your Fusion monsters to dodge your opponent's targeting effects while it's in the GY. Feel free to cut this.</li> </ol> <strong>• <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a></strong> - Your other relevant Normal Summon in the game. Super Polymerization on legs but can be responded. Regardless, weaker Super Poly is still Super Poly. You can set this against Dragon decks and contact fuse for <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus</a>.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous</a></strong> - Can special summon herself. Brings out Fallen of Albaz from the Deck. Also a LIGHT target for <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a>.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a> + <a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a></strong> - The main reason why you can bring out Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon faster than Verte turbo decks. Also a great <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a> bait.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a></strong> - LIGHT target, which the deck DESPERATELY NEEDS. A Fairy, for the purposes of summoning <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>. And you can always shotgun this against your opponent to cut off their brave token engine. Could be any hand trap, so long as they're LIGHT, DARK, or <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom</a>.  Spells  <strong>• <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></strong> - Banishing DARK monsters face-up is not a problem, your Fusion monsters can recycle them anyway. Also pair this with <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> for a +1.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a></strong> - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a></strong> - Yes, my Fusion Spell uses materials from the Deck, cry about it.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - You're almost always dumping Tragedy with either. Gold Sarc is just better because it plays around <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a></strong> - The reason why I prefer playing less copies of Aluber, because I can summon him off of this anyway. Also, if you pitch Tragedy with its effect, or if you play a Branded Shaddolls variant, you can chain block Aluber from getting <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash</a>ed.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> - You literally have no reason to not play this card. All of your Fusion monsters are Super Poly targets.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong> - Your main search target for Aluber. One of the three reasons why you can summon <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> in this deck, and also the main reason why it is so worth it to play in this deck, because it can bring him or any Level 8 or higher Fusion monster back from the GY when a non-Fusion Fairy monster you control is either destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent's card effect. Feel free to cut it to 1, but it's always good to have insurance in case it gets banished.  Traps  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a></strong> - Searchable <a data-name=""Call of the Haunted"">Call of the Haunted</a> for Despia monsters or Level 8 or higher Fusion monsters, and can also be a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> on resolution in the form of a Trap. I hope you can start to see a pattern now why Super Poly is a MUST HAVE in a deck like this.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a></strong> - Searchable <a data-name=""Solemn Warning"">Solemn Warning</a> that can also be used to recycle your Branded Spells/Traps by banishing itself. Feel free to bump it up to 3 or cut it down to 1 if you prefer.  <strong>The Extra Deck:</strong>  <strong>• <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong> - Honorary boss monster. Gives all your Fairies effect targeting protection, can also bring any Fairy monster in your GY OPT. A cute interaction you can do is summon him using <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> as Fusion Material and Special Summon it during your opponent's Main Phase and Tribute it for its effect.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Despian Proskenion</a></strong> - Despia boss monster, supposedly. Has a neat effect of either stealing or banishing an opponent's Extra Deck monster in the GY, also burns your opponent equal to the original ATK or DEF of a monster it destroys by battle, whichever was higher. Great Super Poly target.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> - This deck has absolutely NO REASON not to play Dragoon in this deck. It's a Towers boss monster that you can bring out without using Verte Anaconda or Red-Eyes Fusion, which are both the problematic parts of summoning him, has the same omni negate the racist tokens provide, except it's also a Level 8 Fusion monster that has FULL SYNERGY WITH YOUR DECK, UNLIKE THEM EXPENSIVE ASS TOKEN ENGINE, can opt pop a monster your opponent controls and burn it, and can be brought back with either <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum </a>or <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Theater</a>. This is the main reason why I am compelled to make this list even when I've already made like five or more iterations of this deck, all of which have Dragoon and I have tested against post-DIFO decks and survived well enough.  <strong>• The Branded Dragons (<a data-name=""Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon"">Mirrorjade</a>, <a data-name=""Lubellion the Searing Dragon"">Lubellion</a>, <a data-name=""Abyssal Dragon Alba Renatus"">Alba Renatus</a>, <a data-name=""Masquerade the Blazing Dragon"">Masquerade</a>, <a data-name=""Titaniklad the Ash Dragon"">Titaniklad</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion</a>)</strong> - The stars of the show, all Super Poly targets with the following effects: <ol>  	<li>Mirrorjade - Your most forgiving Super Poly target. Can once per every other turn, banish a monster on the field without targeting at a cost of sending a Fusion monster that lists ""Fallen of Albaz"" in its text from your Extra Deck to the GY. Also destroys all monsters your opponent controls during the End Phase of the turn it leaves the field.</li>  	<li>Lubellion - One of the main reasons this deck can recycle. It Fusion Summons at a cost of a discard by shuffling the materials of that Fusion monster from your GY or banished to the deck. The second reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck.</li>  	<li>Alba Renatus - The <a data-name=""Chimeratech Fortress Dragon"">Chimeratech Fortress Dragon</a>/<a data-name=""Invoked Purgatrio"">Invoked Purgatrio</a> of the Deck. It can search ANY Polymerization or Fusion Normal Spell from your Deck the turn it was sent to the GY.</li>  	<li>Masquerade - The bane of combo decks. Makes your opponent pay taxes in LP for each time they attempt to activate a card or effect. This effect is not a once per copy, so having two of him stacks, bumping it up from 600 to 1200 LP per card or effect activation.</li>  	<li>Titaniklad - Your main fodder for Mirrorjade, except this time, you won't be searching for a Dogmatika monster, but Special Summoning Fallen of Albaz instead as an interruption.</li>  	<li>Albion - Ideally you'll be summoning him first before Lubellion, but he's the third reason you can summon Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon in this deck. It Fusion Summons without a cost by banishing the materials of that Fusion monster from your hand, field, and/or GY. It also sets you a Branded Spell/Trap from your Deck if it is sent to the GY this turn, ideally either <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> for additional interruption or <a data-name=""Branded Condemnation"">Branded Condemnation</a> for protection.</li> </ol> <strong>• <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a></strong> - This deck can make Winda, so why the hell not. Also stops Brave Tokens from bringing out the chicken.  <strong>• <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia</a></strong> - Generic Super Poly targets, one of which has a pretty relevant interruption/floodgate effect.  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>  #1. Don't play it with them Brave Tokens. Not because you can, doesn't mean you should. #2. This deck needs LIGHT targets, not overpriced engine that does nothing more for the deck. You'd be much better off running Kaijus instead. Speaking of which, if you want a free omni negate but also want a LIGHT target, just play Invoked in this deck, simple. #3. I also have a 60 card list of Branded Dogmatika Invoked Shaddolls, I do not know who wants to see it or whether I should also post that or not. I'm just saying. #4. If your deck can abuse Super Poly, there's no reason not to do it while it's still at 3. #5. If your deck can abuse BOTH Dragoon and DPE, there's no reason not to do it while they're still both legal.  Overall, not to be a Conspiracy Carl but I'm starting to think that people just love to hate Fusions (and Pendulums), but if all it takes for the prices of Branded cards and Structure Deck to go down is for them to be boycotted and propagandized as being terrible, I'll take it. For now, I'll still categorize this list as a ""non-meta deck"". As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can."

The best way to do it is to get Wightbaking in the grave first then use it's effect to dump Wightprince which will also send Skull Servant and Lady In Wight to the grave. you can then Banish 2 other ""Skull Servant"" monsters along with Wightprince from your grave to special summon king of the skull servants from your deck.  If you summon Uni-Zombie, Gozuki, or Shiranui Solitare (to go into Uni-Zombie) you can dump a lot of cards in the grave!!! Plus cards like One For One and Hand Destruction maximize your ability to get as many cards into the grave as possible.

This is a fairly consistent FTK that abuses Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth, which I have thought for a long time is strong enough to be banned, so I set out to find a way to break it, and I think this is it. There is just so much about this deck that happens to work out so perfectly, it's honestly kind of crazy. The FTK goes like this:  -Get any 2 level 4 monsters on the field with a Coelacanth in the grave (Leaffish does this, as well as a discard of Coelacanth to summon White Stingray, or Foolish. Summoner Monk does this by itself if you summon Leaffish.)  -Make Dugares and Summon Coelacanth  -Activate Coelacanth summoning specifically Gluttonous Reptolphin Greethys, a Royal Swamp Eel, and any other 2 Level 4s.  -Summon Halq, bring out your Lv 1 Dark Dragon tuner (specifically Dark Dragon, the Rokket one works too), and synchro with Coelacanth to make Beelze in either the leftmost or middle main monster zone (important for Geonator Transverser.)  -Link Halq and one of the 4s to make Geonator Transverser so that it points to Beelze  -Use the Reptolphin and the last Lv 4 to make White Aura Monoceros to bring back Coelacanth  -Activate Coelacanth again (yes, it's a soft once per turn) and summon a Royal Swamp Eel and Beautunaful Princess  -Make Garden Rose Maiden and search Black Garden and Activate it  -Overlay Monoceros and Coelacanth, who are both 7s, to make Red Eyes Flare Metal Dragon, which will trigger Black Garden. Put the Token into the other Geonator Transverser Zone.  -Switch control of Beelze and the Token, then link the token for Link Spider.  -Link away Transverser, Garden Rose Maiden, and Link spider for Agave Dragon, which will burn for 100 because of the Dragon Tuner you used to make Beelze, triggering the Beelze/Flare Metal interaction which will FTK your opponent.  I haven't actually played this deck in any super competitive format, so I don't know how good it actually is. I have Crossout and a few garnets for it since after the FTK tools the deck space is pretty free.

Should work but I need to tweak it a little. Ojamas work really well with ABC but I wanted to keep it purely Union-based, plus I don't like the playstyle of the Ojama version.</span>  <span>Basically just get A-to-Z Dragon Buster Cannon out and you'll have an insanely strong wincon. Its effect is extremely similar to Herald of Ultimateness, but A2Z doesn't feel nearly as cheesy and has better stats. Herald requires Fairies, A2Z can discard any card. On the other hand, Herald can also negate Summons. A2Z can also banish itself to bring back ABC and XYZ. That's why I run two A2Z, because if you split it up and don't have something like Transmodify, you can't get it back like you can with ABC and XYZ.</span>  <span>Colossus is there because Nemeses Corridor can just generally help in the first place AND allows you to summon TD Colossus. Say you banish A2Z and bring back ABC/XYZ to stop it from being destroyed by battle or something; now you can use Nemeses, bring A2Z back to the Extra Deck, summon Colossus, and use ABC/XYZ to once again summon A2Z.</span>"

Sadly, not many of the cards used then are still applicable in modern Trinity and many were cut during the extended deck tinkering (sadly, Grandsoil was one of those casualties), so the deck is now a soup of engines with lots of micro-synergies. PUNK is perhaps the best out of the bunch, offering a good foundation of advantage and disruption to build on, plus a big finisher with the level 11 Synchro. Psy-Frames are the next big engine - warping the style of gameplay for both players, but sadly at a loss of consistency. Psy-Frames thrive on an empty field, which informed a lot of the S/T choices. Rounding out the deck are support pieces that assist with Earth, Psychic, or the Psy-Frame gameplan. Personal standouts for me include Linkslayer, Sauge de Fleur, Psychic Feel Zone, and the duo of Psy-Framelord Omega and Virtual World Shenshen. They can both put back your banished monsters, which makes the Psy-Frame drawback of banishing your Drivers far less impactful - on top of being great bosses in their own right. Give this a try if you want to have some unorthodox fun, or explore some off the wall cards.

It can go first but it is definitely not optimized to. In terms of how viable it is, I would put it a little lower than the average Blue-Eyes engine in Master Duel. In general, the idea is to try and get one of your big, bad synchro monsters out onto the field, and if that isn't possible than at least get Benki out onto the field. There are some effect negations in the form of Ash Blossom, Soulbang, Soul Beads and Flutist. I made this deck for Master Duel so the idea to have 3 Maxx Cs in the deck is a necessity for almost every deck that wants to go second. Battleball and the Kaiju in this deck have the most interesting interaction since they can be used to easily summon either your big boss Train synchro or your Susanowo, but both cards in general are useful since all of your boss monsters overpower the Kaiju and Battleball can still synchro summon while removing one of the monsters on your opponents side of the field (Note; Battleball's effect is counted as tributing, but you have to target your opponents monster).  In terms of clearing your opponents board, you have Kaijus, the Train (Discard two cards to target and destroy two cards), Ogre (The Red Synchro monster which is basically Harpie's Feather Duster), and Sarutobi (Get rid of one spell or trap + some burn damage). The only one that you'll probably abuse is Ogre, so feel free to run 3 of them if you want.  There's a lot of cool stuff in this deck but honestly, it isn't the greatest. There's a lot this cards can do, but there isn't really any consistent effect negation of any kind and also can be easily negated itself. It also usually can't OTK, and takes 2 turns to kill. If you wanna run a more consistent OTK deck, run Numeron or plenty of other better archetypes. I did get to Diamond with this deck, but that was after a lot of trial and error."
