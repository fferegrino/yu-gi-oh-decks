Use Union Carrier to equip Mist Valley Thunderbird to Simorgh, during the end phase summon Ape Avian from the had or deck with Simorgh. Proceed to negate a lot of stuff. Otherwise summon the barrier statue if you think you'll need it more.  With simorgh onslaught, you can get the birds in your hand and in your graveyard. You can either normal summon them (you get extra normal summons with bird of the beginning and the field card) or you can try to get them in the graveyard to use their special summoning effect.  The synchros and xyzs are there for when things go wrong and you either need more cards or to destroy your opponent's stuff. Nahata and unexpected dai help getting them out.  If you manage to succesfully lock your opponent out of his turn you can use borreload, and S39 to finish your opponent, if you need to stall longer summon what's left between Dark Simorgh, the barrier statue and Apex avian.

We run 9 Prologue and dragon link engine easily fulfill the materia,"No Linkross, no Elpy, it means we only use minimal dragon link combo. We turbo Romulus via Striker Dragon like usual, add Boot Sector Launch and Ravine, use Ravine discard 1 (Memories should be the discard priority if drawn, Dragon Buster comes next) send Absorouter, use Absorouter add Tracer, use Boot Sector ss Tracer, use Tracer pops field ss Synchron, make Pisty on the left zone, then make Striker Dragon again like standard, use Pisty ss 1 dragon, make Borrelend. Set Prologue/Trap Trick to complete the combo. We can have Dragon Buster lock by sending it with Prologue from deck or Ravine from hand if we already guaranteed to have Memories in GY.  The main deck is mainly consist of extender to support normal summoned Buster Whelp for dragon link. REDMD, Noctovision, Monster Reborn, Quick Launch, and World Legacy Guardragon are the perfect choice for it. Only 2 Black Metal Dragon cus its not our main normal summon but its still a 1 card dragon link (but we have to hard draw Prologue/Trap Trick). The rest is just staples.  Pros: Super consistent, big monsters, floodgate effect, many staples.  Cons: Bad matchup against backrow deck, link monster cant be in def position."

If your opponent likes special summoning from hand, slap them with a 1000 LP tax on it with Queen of Thorns. Cauldron is just to help with LP, but in case you go up against Mystic Mine and you have it, tell them to f*** off by playing it and watching them burn. Remember to chain block; all the Aromage effects will activate at the same time and are mandatory, though a lot of them are soft once per turn. Homemade and fun, enjoy the deck from the Mommy Marjoram to the basically free recycling of plants from the grave."

So far this deck has been a lot of fun playing against my friends (and long time Yu-Gi-Oh! enthusiasts) during our evening, ""Duels @ Dusk!"". I think the strategy is pretty self-explanatory when looking at the provided deck list. Not sure if it would be considered meta, but, even without the use of a side deck, I'm 12-0 against ALL of my friend's and their best decks.  Please, feel free to drop some knowledge, as I am somewhat new to the current game as it stands! I like to chat about possible strategies!  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Added a few extra tech monsters/spells to the deck for a few different options. Each variation of the deck performed almost entirely the same way (obviously), unless the effect of the new tech was introduced. 15-1 as of this evening 9/5/2020  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Played a couple games last night with an extra Mathematician. The three Mathematician actually helped the flow of the strategy. This is the best build I've had luck with so far using an almost pure Earth/rock theme to summon Fossils! 9/6/2020  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> The deck felt cluttered this evening and after adding so many different tech cards, it felt as if they were only slowing down the main focus: find Fossil Fusions and summon from the extra deck. I ended up removing a lot of the fodder cards and settled on more direct approach. relying on the Adamancipator engine to excavate those lower level cards that help my strategy more, rather than trying to negate the opponent at every turn. This build feels much faster (removing cards such as Gate Blocker, Tackle Crusader and the third Block Dragon) although, I think the single Primineral Kongreat will be swapped out for the full playset of Block Dragons.

So you can special summon with it multiple times within one turn if you run multiple copies or bounce it back to your hand with cards like Blackwing Zephyros the Elite. I chose World Chalice to go with the Empowered engine since it's a combo heavy deck and somewhat focuses on Normal Monsters that the Empowered have some synergy with. Mainly Beckoned by World Chalice since it's a Warrior and can therefore bring out Isolde which is a great combo maker. The deck can make some pretty crazy combos but isn't as consistent as some more ""mainstream"" combo decks. It has a lot of bricks like the bamboo cards and 3 normal monsters. Never the less the deck is really fun to use. I often ended up making misplays because I got overwhealmed by the possible ways I can end the combos.</span>  Replays: https://youtu.be/ZQo4DVJkswg"

Because of this, I had to try them out in Traditional Format and they do indeed work amazing as a early play for turboing the Orcust combo, as well as help lead to really crazy combos.  Adding them to the typical Traditional Format Orcust deck gives them a bit of a boost to them, just watch out for hand traps of course. The Predaplant Engine can search out Dimension Fusion for even more explosive plays. Rarely are any of these cards dead in your hand, especially with some of the new Phantom Rage support.  Side deck is alternative options you can try."

Built-in extenders, main deck boss monsters, ROTAs for days, plenty of one card combos, and even the ability to hand loop.  I wanted to run all the extra bells and whistles as well as full numbers of the combo pieces, but I didn't want to force myself to run 60 cards. I want to consistently combo off, I want to run interaction and protection, and I want those ""extenders"" that make hand looping better, or allow me to make 3 negates.  ROTA is ROTA, it's a Warrior deck, nuff said. Heritage of the Chalice searches for any Infernoble extender, as well as Durendal (thining, searching), or Arfeudutyr (backrow removal). Durendal is especially important as rotas 5-7, because you can loop it out of the GY with Renaud after sending it with Isolde. I'm running back down to 1 Smoke Grenade of the Thief. I do like to see it, actually, but not as much as an actual starter or extender, and the deck always sends it with Isolde, so access to it is still virtually guaranteed. Living Fossil is one of 4 extenders in the deck - maybe okay as a backup to start combos, or in combo with Oliver, mostly here as Equip fodder, because we need 5 different names (in case we see a brick).  Ogier is essential to run for her Equip effect, but 3 of her and 3 of Renaud help make your most reliable opening combos and anti-Nibiru combos more easily. Astolfo is only here because she's technically sort of necessary for certain Infernoble combos, and a decent extender in its own right, worth it as a 1 of to search out for the combos. Oliver is another essential combo piece - you're happy to see all of these, (but notably search most of them out in the usual combo anyways). 3 Gearfried seems essential in this deck, more than 40 cards was a tough sell at first, mostly because of how good Gearfried IS in the hand, but the exchange is having a higher % chance to see your one card starters without giving up interaction. You can search this with some of your main combos anyways, so it's not like you won't see it. Charles sees it at end of turn, and Ogier Renaud also adds it to hand.  Sublimation Knight summons Squeak Knight - a Fire Warrior way to start games. Better than that is Neo Space Connector and Aqua Dolphin, which does the same, but lets you trade a card to snipe a weak monster (like a hand trap) out of your opponent's hand. The only downside is that combo isn't fire, but it is well worth it, since it can force your opponent to use their hand traps early. Not perfect protection, since the card is Ashable, Veiler, Imperm, etc. Still good, especially in a deck already hand looping. Fire Flint Lady is the other extender - free extend, searchable off all the Rotas (Not straight through Heritage, but through Durendal through Heritage), cool bonus effect to trigger Ogier sometimes. Worth it as a one of, super free card. The other warrior Special Summons are just a LITTLE too situational to make the cut, but if you aren't running Imperm or other traps The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine might just make the cut. In a more Nibiru format (which we might see when Dragoon rage dies down) Imperm could be out, and we'd have an extra extender. I can't think of another warrior extender that is worth it.  The last engine in the deck is the Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon engine. Since we're 55 cards, you won't see your bricks as often as a smaller deck, and this really helps make the engine feel super free. It means a TRULY disrupted combo is one extend away from... Well... The best boss monster ever, I'm pretty sure. It also means you can follow-up without wasting too many extra deck slots. You aren't making this ON TOP of your board, EVER (Verte Anaconda and Auroradon are nonbos). But you're making it out of disruption reasonably often, and that makes the deck harder to disrupt properly.  There are 15 interactive cards, with one brick related to them. 9 Hand traps is actually lowish for a 55 card deck, but the other interactive cards are good in a lot of situations anyways. Gamma, Imperm, and Veiler give us good cards that hit on Zexal, Anaconda, and Halqifibrax, generic monster negates are almost always good, and these help ensure going second isn't a lost cause.  Triple Tactics Talent is mostly here to help with the hand snipe plan, it can be very disruptive if your opponent is running hand traps, and all of the effects are good. If you're going second it simply won't be dead, and if you're going first and it's dead you didn't need it. Called are also here to help with hand traps, but can be a good interruption going first, and even has strong applications going second. Wanting these cards on top of hand traps was another big reason for running more than 40 cards. We have hand traps, we are hard to hand trap, we have interaction, and we snipe hands almost by accident.  1 O-Lion and 1 Jet is fine. Sure, some combos need O-Lion in the deck (the biggest ones) but you CAN always combo off when you see O-lion, so I don't think it is worth it at all. I thought about Pot of Desires, but it left me, well, desiring. The deck is consistent enough without it, adding it warps deckbuilding decisions, and I'm unlucky with Desires banishes, so who needs em.  Side Deck was all about having 9 cards to bring in against Combo, and 9 cards to bring in against control. Evenly fulfills the role of board breaker and backrow remover together, Nibiru comes in over Called (Or Dragoon engine) vs combo, Forbidden Droplet can also come in. Since we're more than 40 cards, I needed easy to side in generic cards that I could run in multiples, so sidedeck is that.  Cut Impermanence for Ash Blossom. It's not quite as good as Imperm in this meta (Verta Anaconda dodges the effect very nicely) but this allows the deck to play Shade Brigandine for another warrior extender. I found my spell and trap zones clogged with equip spells, so being able to always activate Ash out of the hand is useful.  Sublimation Knight and Neo Space Connector are both 1 card Isoldes, which end on Auroradon + Savage + Charles, which is an Omni-negate, a pop, and a hand snipe (potentially 2 with Dolphin), and OTK damage on board. Add Oliver or Smoke Grenade to the combo, and you're getting an extra hand snipe off off Auroradon's ability. Add Renaud, and you can also get an extra hand snipe, by adding Smoke Grenade late, and popping Renaud and the Smoke Grenade. Any Isolde will go into this combo pretty easily.  Ogier + Renaud can send Gearfried, pick him up, make Ignoble Knight, equip Durandal, add Fire Flint Lady or Astolfo. It can then summon Gearfried and equip it with Ogier, Boom, Nibiru proof Combo. Since these combos use the Auroradon to search O-Lion you can't do this if O-Lion is in the deck (but between Dragoon and the normal combo, you'll still have options). Ogier + Durendal (or ROTA, Heritage) does the same thing without making Ignoble Knight.  Sub Knight or Neo Space Connector + Renaud is a five interaction board: You can use all of your resources, Halq, Linkross, Auroradon, Ignoble Knight, Jet and O-lion, most of your infernoble cards, and Phoenix Blade, and can end on Herald, Savage, Gearfried, and Charles. All told, that is 1 hand snipe, 1 pop, and 3 negates. Note that thanks to Phoenix Blade, you don't even really have to minus, since you can use Phoenix Blade to fuel Oliver and to pitch for Jet Synchron, meaning the combo also essentially searches you 2 follow-ups (usually a second Gearfried and your other 1 card Dragoon, but occasionally Renaud will take one of these spots, to recur Arfeudutyr vs backrow). This is the main way to see Herald of the Arc Light, but the deck can make it other ways. You can Living Fossil a Sublimation Knight, and recurr Jet Synchron, which will make the extra negate on some boards. If you have Sub Knight (not offa Isolde) and Flint Lady in your hand at the end of your combo, you can use Fire Flint Lady to Summon Sub Knight, then use Squeak Knights secondary ability to become a Tuner when you summon it, make Herald. Last summon! If you successfully combo off without using your Normal Summon, you can Normal Sub Knight for the extra Herald. If you combo off sans Normal, you might be able to use Aqua Dolphin or Neo Space Connector to search it plus Jet Synchron (or maybe Renaud or Oliver).  Divine Sword Phoenix Blade is slightly underwhelming, but it turns on Gearfried, and fuels the full combo. Linkuriboh means Jet Synchron can be a 1 Card starter that makes Dragoon, helping smooth out bricky hands by turning them into low-end plays. You could run Deskbot 001 to have Herald+Savage out of Jet, as well as freeer Herald + Savage out of Isolde. Not really worth it IMO, we're here to snipe hands, and you can still pull off Herald + Savage pretty easily without the extra brick. You can also go Herald + Savage off of just Gamma, but this burns important combo pieces. Still, it makes Gamma feel like more protection for your Rotas.  Other things I've snubbed include: 1) Extra Halqs. More Halq combos is good, and if makes it easier to comeback from disruption, but it's simply not essential. 2) Ravenous Croc. Draws cards + pop cards. Real problem in this deck is opportunity cost - any time you're making Croc you're making it instead of Charles, which in turn means you're trading potentially better protection and a better body (and a hand snipe going first) usually just to draw 1 card. 3) I've snubbed Trish. You can technically make Trish as a going second option, but I'd rather snipe hands deliberately going first. Charles and Dragoon both work to break boards - if I were to run any of these it would be Trish, over Linkuriboh. It would be trading some consistency for flexibility, and I'd rather be highly consistent, particularly since Charles and Auroradon help break boards going second anyways, as does Dragoon. Lastly, if you don't like fun you could run True King of All Calamities. I was more interested in that in the Librarian Synchro version of the deck, which could still do most of these combos, (sans one Anti-nibiru combo) but could also go +6 while making Calamities. In this version, the option feels redundant. Sure, sniping hands and then making Calamities is pretty good, but even in the version more dedicated to doing that it felt a little bad to turn 2 level 9s into one Calamites (especially deciding whether to give up a negate or a hand-snipe/pop.) One final, honorable mention is Nekroz of Clausolas. You can always add Sub Knight to your hand with Isolde, meaning if you see Clausolas you can search Nekroz Cycle and end on an extra Negate (it is also an extra generic Warrior effect monster you can sometimes special summon). The downside to this is that Nekroz Cycle is a complete and total brick, and that you might want to actually USE the monster you add with Isolde as a follow-up, and don't have a ton of excess level 3 monsters to make this play with. I could still see it as a Meta Call - it's a 2 card engine that takes the ceiling of the deck up to 4 negates a pop and a snipe (conveniently 6 interactions... one for each card in a going second starting hand!) I don't think it is really necessary however, and cards like Triple Tactics Talent and Effect Veiler might be stronger, are certainly more flexible and don't require bricks to run. A 1/1 line would mean you'd have the same odds of seeing your extra interruption as your brick, and then you have to shape your plays around 1 situational negate, instead of preparing follow-up plays and using the extra cards in your hand as other forms of extenders or interaction. Super Quantum Red Layer just seems bad. A lot of your combos require all of your zones to be free, and you can't really use it to extend out into Verte Anaconda when you want to. Sorry Power Ranger, you don't make the cut.  Going into Verta Anaconda and saving the combo is viable, as is saving Anaconda for follow-up plays. If you DO want to go Verte Anaconda turn 1, I'd advise going into Isolde first, in order to search a follow-up play - you have 2 for a reason. Shade Brigandine can't make Anaconda (normal monster), but at least you can summon it when you need it (plus, Isolde does make Anaconda anyways. It just doesn't run Isolde into Anaconda)."

I have made a few significant changes to the deck since I last posted here and it honestly feels just as good as it did when we still had three malicious. Without further ado lets get into the changes:  Ash in the main? -- I moved Ash from the side deck into the main taking out the pots and foolish. While the pots were nice for a while the hit to malicious meant that sometimes if your opponent interrupted you at the right time you couldn't use acquisitiveness. I could have just dropped that and replaced it with another avarice, but I decided to take all three cards out and put the most reliable hand trap into the main. I'm sure someone will say, ""Why not called by?"" Because that card doesn't do anything. No hand trap that I can called by really hurts, and if I really want the banish then i would play d.d. crow so its quick.  Adoration replaced by Escuridao -- MBT made a good point that sometimes you get stuck with destiny fusion and cant make sunriser. His solution was to not play miracle fusion and play adoration. I decided that was awful and was capping the power level of the deck pretty drastically. I decided to replace it with Escuridao because it is a super easy poly target if you are locked by destiny fusion, and its a second miracle fusion target that can be mask changed into dark law. So far it has worked very well for me.  Divine Wind??? -- This card is a really cool last-ditch effort card. Imagine you draw absolute trash and the Stratos gets ash blossomed, but you have a mask change in hand. Now you have something to do. You don't need to play blast because you have twin in the main and he's trash so. I CAN NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, THIS IS A LAST DITCH EFFORT. Pretty good against numeron too.  The Side Deck -- Quick rundown: 3x Dark Ruler; the no damage doesn't matter. Most of the time you can break a board and set up plasma dark law and stop their ability to rebuild. 3x Prohibition; If you opponent is playing Dino call UTC they have no outs I promise. UTC kills this deck because all your best monsters can be flipped facedown completely crushing your spirit. Also good for Nibiru if you know your opponent is playing it. 3x Evenly Matched; Same argument for Dark Ruler. 3x Lancea plays really well against a lot of decks. No Block Dragon, no Eldlich trap effects in grave, They cant dimension shifter you if that was something you were concerned about. I just really like the card and its not that bad right now. 2x Royal Decree. I played this in my last version and I stick to it. I dropped one copy for red reboot because im a man now. Absolutely brutal floodgate against some decks and it just wins games against some decks. Imagine red rebooting your opponent for 5 turns.

Base structuring. Plants. Counter Traps. ,"Made a bit of progression on my previous Rikka Deck. Card count is up to 50 from 45, but I've gotten it down to 42 with good ratios. This 50 card variant has been my bookmark/point of reference to go back whenever I scrap an idea.  Monster card selection is pretty established. I've re-re-re-submitted Evil Thorn back into the deck profile. I still do not like the low chance, random situation of drawing 2 or even all 3 copies of Evil Thorn. [Oh, it will never happen.] But it can, and it will, and it has.  Rikka cards are at bare minimal due to Evil Thorn. (Again, another reason I don't really want to use Evil Thorn.)  Rikka Petal, as my starter, has a 74%(@40 cards), 73%(@41c), 72%(@42c) , 71%(@43c), 70%(@44c). 44 being the largest size of the deck, I'm willing to settle for. Starting %'s do not factor in One for One. Just Rikka Petal, Glamour, Lonefire.  Spell and Trap cards are for control and countering. With this deck, I am very much, not scared to trade resources. Pollinosis has to be used for its spell speed and proccing tribute effects. I should be, ideally, triggering effects and re-arranging every turn; not just my turn. Strenna, ranking up. Kanzashi, GY stealing. Flurries, popping off.  Strenna role is to recur Rikka cards and then Pot of Avarice, is to recur all plants back into deck.  Field Spells are still an experiment... if doesn't pan out I can always replace those 7 or so cards with something more useful.  Once I can get a good base for the deck, I will add more meta-compliant, staple cards. Reason why my extra deck looks the way it does. I don't need anything distracting in it, while I work out the main deck core.  Deck surprisingly, and hilarious strong 1st turn setup against Dragoon.  edit: pulled Trap package. solid 42 card profile."

Hyper Librarian 1x Formula Synchron 1x Martial Metalmarcher 1x Borreload Savage Dragon 1x Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon 1x Coral Dragon 1x Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys 1x Infernoble Knight Emperor Charles 1x Herald of the Arc Light 1x Ignoble Knight of High Laudsallyn  So, here's the updated version of the Librarian combo build. Between Hyper Librarian, Coral Dragon, and Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, you can draw an easy 5+ cards in a turn, while leaving Crocodragon, Captain Roland, and Hyper Librarian on the field. This might not sound like a highly disruptive field, but the idea is to use those 5 draws to find extenders, making an even bigger board. I'm running Coral Dragon over Stardust Charge for a few reasons - firstly, you always synchro it off when you're making it, so the downside of needing to leave the field after being Synchro Summoned is minimal. Also, it is always a Tuner, no Metalmarcher required, which actually helps make Charles + Crocodragon through certain combos. Furthermore, it can work in tandem with Charles, Roland, and Crocodragon to help break boards, since we can discard 1 to pop a card. That's a usuful advantage in a deck that is discarding to hand size more fo the time anyways. The deck has lots of other combos, and all the usual Infernoble stuff is here, with one notable exception.  Chaos Ruler is another spicy spicy pick - basically, when you're going to 2 rank 8s path, you almost always ended up synchroing (formerly) Dragite into Charles (Charles is the main boss monster of the deck). So, why not get a free mill 5, maybe find a Hand Trap, synchro it away into Charles, then res it (banishing Hyper Librarian and Linkross), thus being able to use it with a level 1 Tuner to Synchro Crocodragon? Even if you're short the Tuner, it's another big beatstick on the board that has to be dealt with, at the very least. The only other level 8 I could find that gives advantage is Genex Ally Axel, which is not generic, and would be worse if it was. Chaos Ruler is kind of unique in the way that it gains you immediate advantage as a Level 8 Synchro. The downside is that if you brick on your card draws it isn't a line of interaction, but this is a deck just chock full of Rotas and Level 1 extenders.  I can see why people run Super Quantum Red Layer, it makes the combo harder to interrupt for sure, and Tenyi Spirit type effects are always good. However, when we're drawing so many cards it is just a brick, and while its level isn't the worst, it certainly isn't good. Boost Warrior doesn't make full combo with as many cards, but it helps improve the combo by helping assure you make Roland before Halqifibrax (necessary to all the best combos out of the deck), and it isn't once per turn, so that's pretty cool when you see multiples. It is also searchable with Durandel, man Durandel is a strong card.  The deck is 50 cards. I literally have 40 cards I want to run main, + you need some interaction. Having said this, a 50 card deck with 7 1 card starters has better odds of seeing them than a 40 card deck with 4 starters. You have lower odds of seeing specific Infernoble cards in your starting hand, but you also don't really NEED specific cards, you just need to make Isolde. You'll draw into them ;)  For interactive cards, I'm only running 9, mostly because it feels correct to keep my odds of seeing cards reasonably high in such a heavy combo deck. Effect Veiler is really good right now - I'm running this over Imperm for several reasons, it's Light for Chaos Ruler, it's a Tuner for Halq combos, it's a level 1 meaning sometimes you can normal summon it to help combos, and you don't have to set it going first in order to use it (important, since often all of your Spell/Trap zones get used up by equips). Gamma is actually the best hand trap in the meta. Sure, it is kind of dead if we're going first (especially since you're liable to use most of your combo pieces in one turn), but generally speaking you need your hand traps more going second than first anyways, and Gamma is just high impact while still being generic. You can also add this with Chaos Ruler, and it might win you the game if your board gets broken. D.D. Crow and Ghost Ogre aren't dead in the meta, but Crow feels particularly weak right now, and Ghost Ogre is only really good some of the time. Nibiru is good, but a little specific with a several powerful control decks running around tier 1/2. For my final interactive cards, I'm running 3 Triple Tactics Talents. We're already pretty hard to properly hand trap, and Triple T makes us even hard to. The deck can snipe hands twice in one turn with Smoke Grenade of the Thief while setting up Savage + Charles + Auroradon. That's already really powerful, particularly since opponents need to see specific cards and answer in specific places to stop the combo most of the time. Sure, a bulk of hand traps might slow the game to a crawl, but then they also have to do something on board afterwards. Add to that Aqua Dolphin and the hand pressure is very real. Triple T is also not dead going second, since stealing a Monster is pure Beast Mode, and Draw 2 is always good.  I added One For One and Grappler Angler. One for One is another level 1 extender, which can be an extra copy of Renaud, super important, or can summon level 1 tuners or non-tuners for the purposes of the Draw 3 combo. Grappler Angler gives you a tuner One For One can summon after you've used Jet Synchron, and is an alternative to Renaud for when you used him or Durendal up making Isolde. It also summons Jet for games where you see O-Lion.  Combos  Combo #1 - Any Isolde = Level 9 + Savage + Auroradon  1 - Summon Isolde. Add Neo Space Connector. 2 - Send Durandel to the GY, summon Renaud 3 - Renaud effect, add Durendal to the hand 4 - Durendal effect, add Oliver to the hand 5 - Send Renaud to the GY , summon Oliver. 6 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens 7 - Link Renaud + Linkross into Halqifibrax. Summon O-Lion 8 - Synchro O-Lion with a token into Martial Metalmarcher. 9 - O-Lion effect, summon 1 token 10 - Metalmarcher Effect, summon Oliver 11 - Synchro Oliver + level 1 token into Captain Roland. 12 - Use machine token and Halqifibrax to link into Auroradon. 13 - Summon 3 Tokens 14 - Metalmarcher + a token synchro into Coral Dragon 15 - Coral Dragon + a token synchro summons into a level 9, and you draw 1 additional card. 16 - Roland + token synchros into Borreload Savage Dragon.  If you didn't brick out with equip spells, you can send 4 to the GY to summon Oliver that way (as a level 4), thus setting up the GY with Smoke Grenade of the Thief, and saving Renaud, Oliver, and Durendal for later. If you see a 1 card Isolde alongside either Oliver or Renaud, you can pick back up a Smoke Grenade of the Thief and use Auroradon in this combo to snipe an additional card out of hands. Same thing when you see Smoke Grenade. This is actually the low-end for the deck, but if you see O-Lion you're stuck using it with Halq instead of Jet, and also it is nice to be able to consistently end on this board if you need to - this is the combo that usually puts the fewest pieces onto the board, but unlike some of your other combos, you aren't reliant on card draws to really go off.  Combo #2 - Any Isolde = Draw 3 + Savage + Chaos Ruler  1 - Summon Isolde. Add Neo Space Connector 2 - Send 4 equips (incl Phoenix Blade) to the GY to summon Oliver 3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens 4 - Link Oliver + Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Jet Synchron 5 - Link Jet Synchron + Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens 6 - Auroradon effect, tributing itself and a token, summon O-Lion 7 - Synchro O-Lion + Token, summon T.G. Hyper Librarian. 8 - O-Lion effect, summon 1 token. 9 - Use Divine Sword Phoenix blade to banish warriors and add it to hand 10 - Jet Synchron effect, send Sword to the GY, summon Jet 11 - Synchro Jet + cyberse tokens into Martial Metalmarcher, draw 1 card 13 - Martial Metalmarcher effect, summon O-Lion. 14 - Synchro summon Synchron + token into Captain Roland, draw 1 card 15 - Synchro Roland + token into Borreload Savageraw 1 card, equip Auroradon to Savage. 16 - Synchro Chaos Ruler, draw 1 card, mill 5  This one is nice and spicy, a little card draw. But remember, thanks to Martial Metalmarcher, Chaos Ruler is a tuner right now. That means, you're 1 level 1 non-tuner extender away from making Charles, and since Chaos Ruler can res itself, you're in turn one level 1 tuner monster away from Savage + Ravenous Croc + Charles. And you've just gone +5 in the hand, and you didn't even have to discard - 1 card can draw you 5 cards while adding a card into your hand with Isolde. What is nice about this one, is that it doesn't matter if Oliver is a level 4 for this one, meaning you can do this entire combo exactly like the one above, for when you see your bricks, though without Smoke Grenade of the Thief Charles just isn't as good. One option is also to do it in reverse - make Chaos Ruler while you have Librarian on the field, and then use a Tuner to make Charles or Croc out of it, draw an extra card, or 2 in the case or Crocodragon. However, to res it your Librarian needs to be in the bin, so you can't actually get both level 9s before using the Librarian. Oh well. The mill 5 is a nice little advantage - you don't really always need it, but it is nice to put Ogiers and Olivers into the bin, and your hand traps are, notably, light attribute. Generally speaking, all of your bricks will be out of the deck before you make this card, so even though we aren't built to get huge advantage out of it, it still seems nice. The summon, on the other hand, is absurd for the purpose of Synchro climbing in this deck.  Combo #3 - Any Isolde = Draw 5, Charles + Ravenous Crocodragon  1 - Usual stuff. Isolde, Neo Space connector  2 - Send 4 equips, summon Oliver  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Link Oliver and Linkross into Halqifibrax, summon Jet Synchron  5 - Link Jet Synchron and Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  6 - Auroradon effect, tribute itself and a token, summon O-Lion  7 - Synchro O-Lion + token into T.G. Hyper Librarian  8 - Use Divine Sword as fodder, summon Jet Synchron  9 - Synchro Jet Synchron + 2 tokens into Martial Metalmarcher, draw 1 card, summon Oliver  10 - Synchro Metalmarcher + 1 token into Coral Dragon, draw 1 card  11 - Synchro Coral Dragon + token into Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys, 3 separate draw 1 effects  11 - Synchro Oliver + Librarian into Charles  Now, this one I quite like. Built this part of the combo yesterday and forgot it, so I've updated it now. This gives you some a really solid card draw option, and can pop three cards on the board. You're only going to be able to get one extra snipe off of it most of the time, because usually you see Smoke Bomb when you add it to the hand, but this could let you snipe three targeted cards from the hand, if you see it with Smoke bomb and either have or draw into Renaud (7 rotas helps), or two if you just see Renaud and send the Smoke Bomb. It also gives you extreme card advantage, and potentially a gigantic beatstick as well.  You might notice Roland isn't a part of this combo, and you may be thinking ""how do I get my pop""? You can make Roland in this combo, before you go into Needlefibre, if you have one extender, wheras it would be risky to attempt the draw 3 combo without both requisite extenders. Of course, sometimes that means choosing between, say, being Nibiru proof, hand looping twice, and making 3 negates. A good problem to have. Also, you can just make this going second to break boards while drawing cards.  Formula Synchron can be incorporated into either of the above combos to get even more card draw, (draw 7 plus 2 rank 9s, which is True King of All Calamities for warrior decks willing to run 4-5 equips) but it really is tough to say what to cut for it, particularly since it doesn't contribute to your board in any way, aside from the extra draw power. You're still easily drawing 5-6 with these combos, and 7 at the absolute most, and without discarding anything real thanks to Divine Sword - Phoenix Blade. One is better card draw, the other is a better board, or at least better odds of getting the complete board - the draw 3 should be your usual power move full combo, because it's almost always actually draw 5, Charles, Savage, Croc. The draw 5 comes in when you see Living Fossils or Fire Flint Lady on top of your combo, and/or a Renaud to get you living Fossil, because if you pull it off you could be drawing 7.  Combo #4 - Any Isolde = Charles + Savage, with space to make a monster first.  1 - Isolde adds Neo Space Connector  2 - Isolde summons Oliver  3 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  4 - Synchro Oliver + token into Roland  5 - Link Roland + Linkross into Needlefibre, summon O-Lion  6 - Synchro O-Lion + token into Martial Metalmarcher, O-Lion effect summons a token, Metalmarcher summons Roland  7 - Link token + Halqifibrax into Auroradon, summon 3 tokens  8 - Synchro Martial Metal + token into Coral Dragon  9 - Synchro Coral Dragon + token into Charles, draw 1 card  10 - Synchro Roland + token into Savage.  This is just a mild deviation from the normal combo that results in the same board state, but uses 1 less monster zone, allowing you to, say, put up a Gearfried to protect against Nibiru  Combo #5 - Ogier + Durandel/Renaud = Anti-Nibiru combo  This one is pretty simple, summon Ogier, send Gearfried, activate Durandel, search Renaud, summon Renaud, add Gearfried, Link into Isolde, before you summon with Isolde banish Durandel to summon Gearfried, equip it with Ogier. From there, you can do the above combo as normal. You could make this combo with Renaud + Ogier as well, by making Ignoble Knight of High Laundsallyn.  Combo #6 - Neo-Space Connector (generic Isoldes) + Renaud = 3 Negates + Charles  #1 - Isolde adds a card, sends 4 eqips to summon Ogier  #2 - Ogier sends Gearfried  #3 - Summon Renaud, add Gearfried  #4 - Synchro Renaud + Ogier into Ignoble Knight of High Landsallyn, equip Durendal from the deck  #5 - Durendal effect, add Oliver  #6 - Use Phoenix Blade (banish Isolde + Renaud)  #7 - Send Phoenix Blade, summon Oliver  #8 - Link Isolde into Linkross, summon 2 tokens  #9 - Link Oliver + Linkross into Needlefibre, summon Jet Synchron  #10 - Synchro Jet + tokens into Martial Metalmarcher, summon Oliver.  #11 - Synchro Oliver + Ignoble Knight into Charles  #12 - Link Metalmarcher + Halqifibrax into Auroradon  #13 - Auroradon effect, remove itself and a token, summon O-Lion  #14 - Synchro O-Lion + token into Roland, O-Lion effect replaces the token  #15 - Synchro Roland + token into Borreload Savage Dragon, equip Auroradon, 3 negates  #16 - Using Phoenic Blade to insulate yourself from the discard, summon Jet Synchron from the GY  #17 - Synchro Jet + token into Herald of the Arc Light  #18 - Summon Gearfried  Voila, 3 negates, a pop, and a hand loop. A good option to have in the deck, and the real reason to run Ignoble Knight of High Laudsallyn."

ARC-V anime and the true main antagonist of the series. Before his revelation, he is known as The Darkness or Black Shadow residing inside YÅ«ya Sakaki and his dimensional counterparts. He is the original incarnation of YÅ«ya Sakaki (Standard Dimension), YÅ«to (Xyz Dimension), YÅ«go (Synchro Dimension), and YÅ«ri (Fusion Dimension). Zarc's growing aggression led him to destroy the Original Dimension and take on a dragon form known as Supreme King Dragon Zarc. During his confrontation with Ray, Zarc's soul was split into four and reincarnated into four different lives. He is the original owner of the Four Heavenly Dragons and one of true co-creators of Pendulum Summon.  The Supreme King Deck in the anime doesn't have a really articulated play style by itself given its small membership but can work effectively as an engine. Using ""Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm"", the player is capable of toolboxing into the ""Supreme King Gates"", the archetype's main sources of a Pendulum Scale. Since both ""Supreme King Gate Zero"" and ""Supreme King Gate Infinity"" have Scale values of 0 and 13 respectively, they can potentially allow for monsters of any Level to be Pendulum Summoned, although ""Infinity"" carries a restriction of controlling no monsters in order to Pendulum Summon. So far, there is only one Ritual monster in the archetype, Demise, Supreme King of Armageddon which specializes in the destruction of every card on the field, inflicting 200 points of damage for each card destroyed that way.  Since they cannot do enough on their own given they have few members, the archetype is thus better mixed with other Pendulum cards to maximize the benefits. The ""Supreme King"" archetype pairs extremely well with the ""Magician"" archetype, especially ""Z-ARC Magician"" monsters.  For starters, most of them are DARK monsters so they cannot conflict with the Pendulum Effect of ""Darkwurm"". Secondly their Pendulum Scales have values of 1 and 8, which mix well with the ""Supreme King"" cards since ""Darkwurm"" is Level 4 and both ""Gates"" are Level 7. Thirdly these ""Magicians"" along with ""Chronograph Sorcerer"" are one of the ways to Special Summon ""Supreme King Z-ARC"", the archetype's boss monster. Additionally, the effect of ""Darkwurm"" to Special Summon itself from the Graveyard makes it a useful discard fodder for cards such as ""Pendulum Call"" as the player can instantly gather the means for a Pendulum Summon for no cost and their Pendulum Scales will go uninterrupted.  As a result of this mixture the ""Supreme King"" archetype is capable of more moves, involving greater flexibility in both Pendulum Summon and other Summon mechanics, being able to perform Fusion, Synchro and Xyz Summon.  For Fusions, both ""Zero"" and ""Infinity"" can provide some help since ""Zero"" can destroy itself along with ""Infinity"" to search for any ""Fusion"" card that can help conduct a Fusion Summon, some useful choices including ""Miracle Synchro Fusion"" and ""Odd-Eyes Fusion"". Given the Deck's mostly DARK nature, they can also Fusion Summon ""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"" (and most other ""Predaplant"" Fusion monsters, and ""Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon"", if need be).  For Synchro Summoning purposes, ""White Wing Magician"" being a Level 4 can open possibilities for either Level 7, 8, or even Level 11 Synchro Summoning when paired with either a Level 3, 4, or 7. Since unlike other Tuner Pendulum Monsters, she has no restriction on what she can Summon (but using her after being Pendulum Summoned will banish her), she is an ideal Tuner for generic Synchro Monsters such as ""Red Dragon Archfiend"", ""PSY-Framelord Omega"" or ""Enlightenment Paladin"". If needed other monsters can be used too, such as ""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"", ""Timebreaker Magician"" or ""Noble Dragon Magician"" can open up room for Level 7 Synchro Summoning such as ""Clear Wing Synchro Dragon"" or ""Black Rose Dragon"". Some of these cards can combo well with ""Miracle Synchro Fusion"" as well.  Finally, for Xyz Summoning, the archetype can gain easier access to either Rank 4 or Rank 7 monsters, ranging from utilitarian ones such as ""Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon"", ""Number 39: Utopia"", ""Number 104: Masquerade"" or ""Timestar Magician"" to the likes of ""Number 11: Big Eye"" or ""Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon"". ""Darkwurm"" is interesting due to its self-revival ability from the Graveyard which potentially mitigates some of the otherwise common and taxing cost of Pendulum-Xyz tactics. ""Number 39: Utopia"" can negate attacks to prevent your weaker monsters and this card from getting destroyed, while ""Number 104: Masquerade"" can be useful since its first effect sends one card on your opponent's deck to the Graveyard and its other effect can negate an opponent's monster effect and inflict damage to your opponent.  After dumping ""White Wing Magician"", ""Black Fang Magician"", ""Purple Poison Magician"", by detaching them and sending a ""Pendulum Dragon"" to the Graveyard by ""Foolish Burial"", they can then be banished for ""Z-ARC"".  For Pendulum Summoning, other additional and more mainstreamed cards such as ""Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon"", ""Archfiend Eccentrick"" or ""Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon"". The former can search either of the ""Gates"" and many of the aforementioned ""Magicians"", while ""Eccentrick"" is an effective removal card. In other words, the ""Supreme King"" archetype is fairly flexible since they can be mixed with multiple cards and provide a handful of utilitarian uses.  As per the Master Rule 4, the deck loses its Pendulum Summon power. However, the player would often stand without Pendulum Summon as per the Pendulum Effect of ""Infinity"" thanks to the archetype's penchant for swarming and controlling the field through its ""boss"".  After swarming the Field with weaker monsters, the player can bring out ""Supreme King Dragon"" Extra Deck Monsters and use them to press the opponent. After your opponent gets rid of them and you managed to get ""Z-ARC"" on the field, you can use ""Supreme Rage"" to devastate, or even finish the opponent."

Maybe this is that?  We've got all of the HERO Rotas here, 1 original recipe ROTA, 1 A HERO Lives, and 3 Emergency Call. HEROs will play these forever, probably, not much to see.  Elemental HERO package is pretty standard, 3 Stratos, the archetype searcher/backrow clearer, 2 Shadow Mist, which searches Mask Change and when sent to the GY searches, 1 Solid Soldier, because it remains essential to combos involving E - Emergency Call, and 1 Honest Neos, a hand trap which is here to be searchable with Isolde. I cut Liquid Soldier. We don't need it to search Mask Change anymore, and we don't need it as a water type, with Grappler Angler and Halqifibrax as main combo pieces. The whole Vision Hero package is here - the idea is to summon these late into the turn, after making Synchro plays, to set up Fusion plays. They also put the requisite monsters on the board for Plasma. Malicious and Plasma are both still obligatory. Plasma is better than ever thanks to Roland buffing it's attacks, and the main combo puts 2 spell negates to go alongside the skill drain. No Evil Hero Package here - you could cut a Synchro monster to run a 1/1 line without impacting the deck much. I'd rather the choice between monster and spell negate. Space is tight.  I'm running 3 Neo Space Connector and 1 Aqua Dolphin. It baits out hand traps real good, and starts the deck's main combos, particularly helpful against Nibiru, which the deck can struggle against. Vyon is also sort of a one card starter, by sending Malicious (or in a pinch Shadow Mist to use Sunrise to get 2 warriors to start combos).  One of the main new additions is Fire Flint Lady, the ultimate extender for the deck. You must remember to time it before your Faris fires off, but being able to activate Shadow Mist or Stratos from the hand is amazing, and it's also the best ""free"" warrior extender. We're running 3 of Durendal, the Infernoble searcher, just to search it, though it doubles as Isolde fodder.  The rest are bricks and extenders.  Going first deck. It's devolved into an almost pure going first deck, despite the serious OTK potential involved, and I've cut all the hand traps and interaction. I made room for Sublimation Knight and Armageddon Knight, more one card starters, and trimmed Formula Synchron and Crystal wing from the extra deck to play Rainbow Neos (if you were smart this would be Dragoon, but I like the flavour and the card has serious applications vs Eldlich and for breaking boards. I added in Immortal Phoenix Gearfried - you can't use it to protect you from Nibiru, but it's a free extra negation at the end of your board, provided you combo off, and can make Isolde in rare situations. I added Phoenix Blade, to insulate the deck from the discard from Jet Synchron. I also added 3 Red Layer, as an easy extender to help ensure this bulkier deck still has really good odd of comboing off.  Combo is  1 - Any 2 Warriors into Isolde  2 - Isolde adds a card.  3 - Isolde sends Phoenix Blade to summon Grappler Angler  4 - Link Isolde into Linkross. Summon 2 tokens.  5 - Link Linkross into Needlefibre  6 - Summon Jet Synchron. Link into Auroradon. Summon 3 Tokens  7 - Tribute Auroradon and a Mecha Phantom Beast token to summon O-lion  8 - O-lion plus a level 3 makes T.G. Hyper Librarian. O-Lion effect summons another lvl 3.  9 - Banish 2 warriors from your GY, add Phoenix Blade to your hand.  10 - Send Phoenix Blade from your hand to the GY to summon Jet Synchron from the grave.  11 - Synchro Jet + Cyberse token into Formula Synchron. Draw 2.  12 - Synchro Martial Metalmarcher, draw 1, resummon Formula Synchron  13 - Synchro Summon Roland. Draw 1.  14 - Synchro Summon Savage. Draw 1.  15 - Synchro Summon second negate (whichever is more applicable).  You then use the cards in your hand to make HERO plays. Note that this is just a basic roadmap - Timing Fire Flint Lady in particular is much trickier. During the end Phase you can send a Durandel to the GY to add a Warrior (this is the preferred place to add Honest Neos)  The search for consistency and the growing desure to run lots of cards in HERO has resulted in the addition of more Noble Knights cards. These are relatively flexible Warrior extenders/combo pieces that give me better reason to run Charles and Gearfried. I initially intended to use Nobel Knight Bedwyr as a replacement for Sublimation Knight, a one card starter I could search off of Heritage of the Chalice, which could also search Durandel, and through that Fire Flint Lady. Basically it's just me reducing a very large deck to piles of cards I can use to search other cards. The thing is, the deck didn't miss the one card starter, ever, plus I never wanted to actually use Bedwetter, since it uses up Durandel and Fire Flint Lady. Ogier turns out to be a much better normal summon. Since the combo is pretty flexible, I decided I didn't need 2 of each brick - the combo with O-Lion in the hand is a little weak, but seeing it far from kills your plays, and in a 60 card deck you'll never see it. Living Fossil was added to the deck as a 4th equip, giving you more options out of Isolde, including Dark Law under Nibiru (love me some low ends), Oliver (when you see T.G. Striker), Ogier (to secure access to Gearfried), and Stratos to pop spells and traps and search any hero. It's also just a cool extender you can sometimes bin and then recover, and is just fine in the hand. T.G Striker may have a worse typing than Grappler Angler, but its effect is at least slightly better, being a free summon going second. The real reason it is here is because I'm covering bases, I often want to send both Smoke Grenade and Phoenix blade at the same time, and sometimes I draw an equip or 2. If you do see it, there are alternatives, such as sending Durendal to summon Renaud, add Durendal, add Oliver, bam, or summoning Oliver directly. if you didn't see the equips. Yes, you can and will sometimes brick out hard, but in general between all the searching, and the fact that your main combo draws 5-6 cards, you'll go through 30 cards in a turn easily.  Cut Astolfo, between banishing for Phoenix Blade and wanting to leave fire monsters in the GY it wasn't a useful extender for the deck. Added Arfeudutyr, which means you can still send for 4 when you see 1 non Durandel equip spell. As a result, I cut the little guy and replaced him with O-lion #2."

The ""Evols"" consists of Fire monsters, which simulate an evolution process. The smallest stage in form of the ""Evoltiles"" consists entirely of Reptile monster, who try to either summon the next higher step in the food chain or generate resources via their effects. The ""Evolsaurs"" are all Dinosaur monsters and are the weakest member of the ""Evol"" group, because all of their monsters have no effect unless they enter the field via an effect of an ""Evoltile"" monster. This alone would not have to be a weakness, but their effects are certainly letting them down. The ""Evolzars"", however, are making up for that by being pretty powerful Dragon Xyz monsters which all manner of negate effects.</p> <p>For the playstarters, I have ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Najasho"">Evoltile Najasho</a>"", who summons an ""Evolsaur"" monster when tributed. By using ""<a data-name=""Evo-Force"">Evo-Force</a>"" on ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Najasho"">Evoltile Najasho</a>"", you gain two Level 4 ""Evolsaurs"" which then can be used immediately to summon a Rank 4 Xyz monster of your choice. One copy of ""<a data-name=""Enemy Controller"">Enemy Controller</a>"" is there for some cheeky plays in the opposing turn and ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Najasho"">Evoltile Najasho</a>"" qualifies as ""<a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>"" fodder since it is a Reptile and therefore a non-Dinosaur monster. ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>"" generates less resources when used with ""<a data-name=""Evo-Force"">Evo-Force</a>"", but has its own effect to fetch a monster. Also, the effect of re-fueling one of your Xyz monsters is pretty insane and allows the already powerful ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" to negate even more plays the opponent tries to pull off. On the Dinosaur side of things, you have the trusty ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>"", who can either fetch necessary cards or delivers graveyard setup.</p> <p>On the ""Evolsaur"" front, I have added two ""<a data-name=""Evolsaur Cerato"">Evolsaur Cerato</a>"", since it becomes a 2100 ATK beater quite regularly while also being able to search for further ""Evoltiles"" when destroying monsters in battle. One ""<a data-name=""Evolsaur Diplo"">Evolsaur Diplo</a>"" gives you another option of backrow removal in the Main Deck while one ""<a data-name=""Evolsaur Vulcano"">Evolsaur Vulcano</a>"" is there for potential revive plays. Further revival can be found in ""<a data-name=""Miscellaneousaurus"">Miscellaneousaurus</a>"", who also works as a protective option while in your hand. The Main Deck boss monsters in form of ""<a data-name=""Overtex Qoatlus"">Overtex Qoatlus</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"" are very useful in both beatdown and stun boards and are also easily summonable via ""<a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>"". While ""<a data-name=""Overtex Qoatlus"">Overtex Qoatlus</a>"" potentially fetches further ""<a data-name=""Evolution Pills"">Evolution Pills</a>"", they can also be searched by the copies of ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a>"". The ""<a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a>""/""<a data-name=""Gold Sarcophagus"">Gold Sarcophagus</a>"" combo is simply there to give you more consistency for Xyz summons.</p> <p>With ""<a data-name=""Fossil Dig"">Fossil Dig</a>"", ""<a data-name=""Evo-Diversity"">Evo-Diversity</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""One for One"">One for One</a>"" (alongside the previously mentioned ""<a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a>""), there are a few options that help you search for cards and increase the overall consistency. Some Control-/Stun-oriented options are ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"", a personal favorite of mine which lowers the ATK of Special summoned monsters and negates their effects, a few ""Solemns"" to disrupt the opposing plays, ""<a data-name=""Twin Twisters"">Twin Twisters</a>"" for more backrow removal and two copies of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" to disrupt opposing searches. ""<a data-name=""Evo-Singularity"">Evo-Singularity</a>"" is an absolute wonder if you have enough monsters to trigger the card and in all honesty who does not want to have multiple negates via ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" which you can then potentially refresh via ""<a data-name=""Evoltile Megachirella"">Evoltile Megachirella</a>""?</p> <p>Since the two copies of ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a>"" are not exactly budget-friendly, I would suggest leaving them out and instead fitting an additional copy of ""<a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Lost Wind"">Lost Wind</a>"" to fill the deck space if the budget is of concern.</p> <p>The Extra Deck is pretty straightforward: One copy of ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"" (which can be summoned via ""<a data-name=""Evo-Singularity"">Evo-Singularity</a>""), one of ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Dolkka"">Evolzar Dolkka</a>"" and three of ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"". ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Solda"">Evolzar Solda</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" are not bad cards, but I find myself going into ""<a data-name=""Evolzar Laggia"">Evolzar Laggia</a>"" way more often than into the other two. The rest really just consists of options for various situations: ""<a data-name=""Pentestag"">Pentestag</a>"" can potentially kill the opponent in combination with ""<a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>"", since you can deal more piercing damage than burn, ""<a data-name=""Linkuriboh"">Linkuriboh</a>"" gets rid of ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaurs"">Animadorned Archosaurs</a>"" that you are not able to use for summons otherwise, ""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" and ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" are more backrow removal (""<a data-name=""Tornado Dragon"">Tornado Dragon</a>"" with two Level 4 monsters and no further cost, while ""<a data-name=""Knightmare Phoenix"">Knightmare Phoenix</a>"" can also use ""Evoltiles"" or ""<a data-name=""Animadorned Archosaur"">Animadorned Archosaur</a>"" but asks for a card in your hand as additional cost), and ""<a data-name=""King of the Feral Imps"">King of the Feral Imps</a>"" if you really need to have a ""Evoltile"" in hand (for example if you desperately need a non-Dinosaur monster for ""<a data-name=""Double Evolution Pill"">Double Evolution Pill</a>"").</p> <p>I personally like the theme of ""Evol"" and could see them being rather good with some more support. However, this current decklist is as far as I managed to get with them in deckbuilding terms. Due to generic Dinosaur support being so powerful, this deck has heavy contenders in form of ""Dino Rabbit"" or ""True King Dinos"" and I would say that both those options are probably stronger than an ""Evol-""-centered build. However, if you want to give the ""Evols"" a spin, feel free to use this list as inspiration. Also, if you are further interested in the ""Evol"" group of archetypes, I would like to invite you to my blog and take a look at the archetype analysis for the ""Evols"" here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/archetype-analysis-evol/"">https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2020/05/19/archetype-analysis-evol/</a></p>"

Save a buck. ,"Super budget approach for a base build of Generaiders. Was throwing together this deck for my nephew and thought this was actually pretty damn good and worth a share.  There are a few pricey cards in here, outside the short printed Generaider cards. Nothing too unreasonable. For example, Condemned Witch. That card itself sits between $5-8 and plays well with Lotpr and Trias. And can fetch your Forbidden Chalice and Lances that can be found in your Structure decks and $1 spare boxes. Maybe later, you can fetch yourself 3 copies of Forbidden Droplets.  World Legacy Monstrosity is pretty cheap steal now with recently getting a reprint(alongside a rarity bump).  Kuji-Kiri Curse, another great card. Might run you a $2. Currently $0.50 to $1.  Ash Blossom(~$11) and Called by the Grave(~$6) are bit pricey as single sells. But you can, and don't know why wouldn't have already done it, get these from the Duel Devastator box. I recommend snagging these from a local store and not online. Save yourself $10-$15. Or... side in some other options.  Phantom Fortress. $1 card.  True King of soon to be, and most likely won't be banned, is a less than $2 option boss.  Nine-Lives Cat is a $0.10 option, that plays well with your Hela and helps loop GY resources from your side and opponents.  Finally, the unfavorable, Purple Trishula. A good $2 optional card, that looks pretty. Helps keep the board tidy with an effect that can be annoying to your opponent.  The overall pricing for this deck sits at about $160. Which sounds like a lot but alot of the pricing comes from Ash Blossom, Called by the Grave, 2 short printed Generaider cards and some of the other non-Generaider card's.  If you're tracking these cards sensibly. You can easily snag these card for barely a headache or pinch to your wallet."

Their restriction doesn't even affect Puppy-Kalantosa play. But, Obedience Scho","No, we wont use the Evil Twin engine for Melffy of the Forest, as the payout for it is super weak, but we still can tho lol. We use the engine for card advantage and interruption with the Kisikil Lilla extra deck monsters. Start with Live Twin monster, make Evil Twin Kisikil, revive Live Twin, make Evil Twin Lilla, revive Evil Twin Kisikil for draw, make Evil Twin Kisikil again so we can summon Evil Twin Lilla during opponent's turn for free pop. Turn 3 we can trigger both the draw and pop. If we have Puppy in hand, we can summon it during the end phase. Monster Reborn allows us to link climb for Unchained Abomination because it re-summon Evil Twin Kisikil.  <strong>Obedience Schooled</strong> combo is what we do to utilize Melffy the best. By summoning <strong>Melffy+Kalantosa+random</strong> (the random can be another Melffy, since we only run small pool of beast) will have 2 interruptions right away. If we draw Kalantosa, we have to summon Fenny instead of Puppy. Make Melffy of the Forest using Melffy + random, use Forest detach Melffy add Melffy Tag, use Tag ss Melffy, make Excited Melffy. During opponent's turn, we can use Excited to re-summon Melffy and Kalantosa, making us can trigger 2 Kalantosa.  Main Deck: Evil Twin engine, 12 starters (3 Kisikil, 3 Lilla, 3 Entrance, 3 Cynet Mining). 3 Melffy Puppy (best Melffy, 3 because you wanna see it the most together with Evil Twin engine), 1 Fenny (for Obedience Schooled play), 1 Tag (combo piece, extender), Hide-and-Seek (protection and recursion, because we play control). 2 Kalantosa (Melffy partner in crime, 2 because you can trigger both) and 1 Valerifawn (can re-summon Kalantosa and triggering it, also as extender for follow-up). 3 Obedience Schooled (best Melffy starter lol). Monster Reborn for link climb/xyz material. The rest is just staple.  Extra Deck: 3 Kisikil and 3 Lilla (play the most copies as spare). 2 Forest (generic, gives plus) and 1 Excited (combo piece, also allows Negalogia play). Unchained Abomination and Knightmares are just generic good fiend extra deck monsters. Sky Cavalry Centaurea (great rank 2 xyz with non-target, non-destruction removal, and allows Negalogia play) and last but not least, Negalogia (wipe boards).  &nbsp;  Pros: Super consistent in putting 2 interruptions, big staples.  Cons: Low atk problem.  Cards to think of: Melfy Catty + Hop Ear Squadron (Catty returns to hand to add Hop Ear, it means Catty-Hop Ear cant work by themselves, so I cut it), Nimble Beaver or other rank 2 engine (good but as I stated Melffy of the Forest turbo is weak after testing), Tribrigade (eats resource too much and requires beast discard, we don't wanna discard our Melffy), Melffy Playhouse (possible multiple interruption, but is a win-more because Puppy and Obedience Schooled already do the same), other Melffy monsters (don't do much as Puppy/Fenny)."

I have focused this deck around the same basic combos (vyon, send shadow mist to the graveyard, etc) but have also added some defenses. The ability to use super poly, the hand traps and normal traps make for some okay counters to whatever your opponent is doing, and the use of fusion recovery helps when you are a few turns in and have exhausted most of your monsters. We have 3 copies of stratos for is functionality and for summoning divine wind with mask change. We also use bubbleman and ocean to get out masked hero acid or absolute zero, two fantastic cards. The ability to get out big damage monsters with E HEROES and the great effects of the MASKED HEROES combo very well together.

These effects not only allow recycling for returning cards to the deck if not also because they allow to use the effect of a card more than once per turn if it was set in the area of ââmagic and traps, activate its effect, touch the graveyard and when it is there it can be used once again, being able to deny for example the effect of two different monsters, or destroy two and more. With all this, the deck has a fairly powerful disruption in the opponent's field so, along with its multiple interruptions to the plays of our opponent, we can bet on damage in our turns, which is not bad for the deck. thanks to bidders such as Morningstar, Nasten, Tezcatlipoca, Superbia, Zerato and even Ixchel herself, since their attack values ââdo not go below 2500 and they all provide very good effects and are important to the deck.  &nbsp;  Deck demostration: <a class=""style-scope ytcp-video-info"" href=""https://youtu.be/IfXj3PtkkM4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://youtu.be/IfXj3PtkkM4</a>"

Wins the mirror match most of the time thanks to balerdroch and super poly consistently wiping out their lich. I definitely recommend trying zombie lich as an alternative, it's much less boring than pure lich and offers some cool plays you couldnt make otherwise. Btw super poly and balerdroch both out dragoon pretty handily so thats cool.
