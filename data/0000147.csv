There are many ways to play with this deck, and you use it any way you like, but this is my way: You start off with alternative dragon, rage with eyes of blue, or a photon monster (photon thrasher, crusher, sabre tiger, etc.), and then photon lead to summon another sabre tiger, or other photon monster. Once you've got out those guys, either photon dragon, xyz or fusion summon and then get out neo blue eyes, or neo galaxy eyes, and then bust the enemy with some tricky traps or spells and attack directly, and win the duel."

Ability to switch to different styles depending on side deck  The deck has a lot of extenders, allowing for options in play depending on the situation.  Cons:  Prone to Handtraps.  Poor recovery after disruptions; you will possibly use the whole hand to reach the primary board and +2 draw on the opponents turn with Formula Synchron and Vampire Sucker  Typically will need to use all in-hand extenders to reach the end board.

That said, you need to draw <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> or the deck literally won't function and you would rather choose to go second. At best, you can pass your turn with <strong>Artifact Durendal</strong>/<strong>Constellar Peliades</strong>, <strong>Dragonic Utopia Ray</strong> with 3 or more<strong> ZW</strong> cards attached to it including a <strong>ZW - Dragonic Halberd</strong>, and 1 other <strong>Utopia</strong> monster which you can choose to equip with <strong>ZW</strong> cards as well.</span>  <span><strong>ZS - Ascend Sage</strong> and <strong>ZS - Arms Sage</strong> are the heart and soul of this deck. They are your only play starters and they provide the most consistent searching in the entire deck since <strong>ZEXAL Construction</strong> is still a neg 1. Another important playmaker in this deck is <strong>Summoner Monk</strong> as it functions as a play starter and extender. You rarely normal summon in this deck and <strong>Monk</strong> can get you material for another xyz summon.<strong> ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</strong> and <strong>Eagle Claw</strong> may provide things like monster and trap negates, but they are here since they bolster your board with Rank 5 access.<strong> Lightning Blade</strong> is the most important card in the deck when you are going through with summoning <strong>Durendal</strong> since it protects your ZW equips from being destroyed and hardly anyone reads cards. <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong> is just another name and it provides targeting protection.<strong> Asura Arms</strong> makes your <strong>Utopia</strong> into a<strong> UCT</strong> (or an actual one if you decide to play <strong>Phoenix Bow</strong>).</span>  <span>You need to see your combo pieces in this deck and things like <strong>ROTA</strong>, <strong>Desires</strong>, <strong>Generation Shift</strong>, and <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> all get you there. You need to see <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> or else you will actually be passing on 1 monster turn 1. <strong>ZEXAL Entrust</strong> provides much needed recycling and extending for the deck. <strong>RUM ZEXAL Force</strong> easily searchable in this deck and it stacks a <strong>ZW</strong> or <strong>ZS</strong> so that you draw what you need with <strong>Tactics</strong>. <strong>ZEXAL Construction</strong> is a neg 1, but you need to play it since it searches like half the deck. Also 1 <strong>Double or Nothing!</strong> to make use of <strong>Utopia Double</strong>.</span>  <span>Extra Deck:<strong> Zeus</strong> is a staple in xyz decks. <strong>Gaia Drake</strong> just gives <strong>Zeus</strong> more material. <strong>Constellar Pleiades</strong> &amp; <strong>Artifact Durendal</strong> are your Rank 5 targets, but you can choose to play something like <strong>Volcasaurus</strong> over <strong>Pleiades</strong> since you usually won't have 2 lights since <strong>Eagle Claw</strong> is a wind. 1 <strong>Dragonic Utopia Ray</strong> to OTK. 1 <strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong> since its a negate and it equips from ED also. 1 <strong>ZW - Dragonic Halberd</strong> for more OTK potential. You can also choose to play his brother,<strong>  ZW - Leo Arms</strong>, if you want another Rank 5 target. 1 <strong>Utopia the Lightning</strong>. 1 <strong>Utopia Ray V</strong>. 1<strong> Utopia Ray</strong>. 1<strong> Utopia Prime</strong> (don't sleep on this one). 1 <strong>Utopia Double</strong>. And 3 <strong>Number 39: Utopia</strong>.</span>  <span>All you need to know about the side deck is that <strong>V Salamander</strong> gets you back advantage later in the game,<strong> Xyz Encore</strong> counters xyz decks and it is searchable off of <strong>Generation Force</strong>,<strong> Shining Draw</strong> is like an okay card, and<strong> ZEXAL Alliance</strong> is another way to gain back advantage despite making you vulnerable to <strong>Sparks</strong>.</span>"

What makes this even more appropriate is that Ai was Yusaku's partner in Yu-Gi-Oh VRAINS, and some of Yusaku's cards work excellently in @Ignister decks. Also, Yami Yugi calls Yugi Muto this a lot in Yu-Gi-Oh!'s Japanese dub.  &nbsp;  Dark Infant @Ignister gives a massive boost to this deck's consistency, because it can search @Ignister A.I.land upon summon, can move to a Main Monster Zone it points to, and change its attribute. This makes summoning The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister easier, and Dark Infant's search effect means you don't need to run Terraforming or 3 copies of A.I.land.  When A.I. first met you is the best Normal Spell in the deck, because it can search an @Ignister monster, and your only cost is that you must reveal a Cyberse monster in your hand or Extra Deck that has 2300 ATK. And @Ignister has those Extra Deck monsters in spades! So 3 of this and 3 Cynet Mining gives @Ignister S-class consistency!  &nbsp;  As for this deck's strategy, it works fine going first or second. If you're going first, your goal is to summon The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister, preferably with Danmari @Ignister in your Graveyard so you can negate one of your opponent's cards. If you're going second, your goal is to go on the offensive with your Extra Deck monsters. You can OTK your opponent with Dark Templar, Wind Pegasus, and Light Dragon. Or you can summon Accesscode Talker with Update Jammer, leaving you with a 4300 to 5300-ATK board wipe that can attack twice."

The deck has only 6 hand trap cards or impermanence and ash blossom, creating a balance to avoid not drawing too many heavy cards. I decided to play 6 magic cards including 3x of Pot of Extravagance, since in this deck the extra deck is not so important you can also banish some cards to draw others; 2x of Pot of Duality to spin the deck, this card later avoids special summoning but this deck the special summon executes it during the opponent's turn so it's quite useful. 1x of the card that cleans up spells and trappings. As trap cards I decided to play the usual cards used in the altergeist but I also used the warning point card that I am testing and I must say that it is a very good card. then otherwise it is quite normal. I recommend in the Side to choose between the 3x of Rivarly I have the summon limit.</span> </span></span>"

Your dose of dumb decks is here! Are you bored of good draong links ? do you wish to play Gaia the fierce knight in your deck ? Then ask no more! Here's a boneless dragon link with a gaia touch.  If you just want to know the objective of the deck, You do guard dragon combos, basicaly with the hieratic stuff and some dragon shennanigans, until you get apo, borreload . BUT SOMETIMES, yes sometimes... remenber it's boneless, you can get to Gaia the magical knights of dragon, easy to make with any Gaia monster and a LVL 5 Dragon monster, with the fusion spell Spiral fusion it gets 5200 atk, 2 attacks, and if you used Curse of dragon, The cursed dragon you get a negate of all effects on your opp monster who have under 5200 atk :) so just another borrelsword, yes. 2 borrelsword. If you go second Gaia the magical knight can let you SS any, well most of the hieratic LVL 5 dragons, letting you use the effect of other to get the normal monsters on the field and get started from there.  BAsic combo is .. guardragon i guess. But well here's one :  normal summon Gaia the magical knight and ss any hieratic ( preferably eset ) then tribute with another hieratic to get the normal monster + hieratic + gaia, then romulus into guardragon plays, for ravin or lance, elpy pisty, i mean it's just gurardragon after that. with maybe a bonus fusion on the board with Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons.  Not much to say, most hand gets a good combo, you can play throught handtraps, but not always, a bit worst than Dragon links but without the option for your opponent tot say '' YoU pLaY dRaGoN LiNk "".  i will soon try to build a ""The Armed dragons of Gaia"" deck but still trying to figure it out :) HF"

If ""bird up!"" (lyrilusc Tri-brigade) is considered competitive, then I don't know how the heck this one isn't. But people never cared about Simorgh cards...  The litte simorgh chickens act as your normal summons AND free extenders (if your opponent' BR is empty, which is always the case going first) to go into Chicken of Sovereignty. Bringing searches a simorgh card on normal summon, and Calamity foolishes one. Calamity is actually a one-card Chicken of sovereignty if your hand is poor.  Bringing can search multiple cards depending on what you need :  -if you open Both him and Calamity, or Elborz : search the other piece, activate the field spell and foolish the chicken of protection on calamity norm and bang! you have the setup for the infamous ""infinite negate combo"" without even going into your tri-brigades yet. If you open Bringing, elborz and something to discard, search Onslaught instead.  -if you open him and nerval : search the field spell, normal nerval and go into linkuriboh so you can search Kerass and do your Tri-brigade plays.  -if you open him and fractaur ( and no other mentionned pieces ) : search sky battle for extra protection.  -you can side-in the big chicken Simorgh of Ancestry going second, for example against Vanity ruler or Winda. Then you need to open Bringing and Elborz, Ancestry or Onslaught : you can use both effect of elborz to tribute summon the big chicken to out up to 2 cards, without targeting, destroying or even special summoning.  &nbsp;  Onslaught is very good as it searches 2 cards and loads your graveyard. The two big dark chickens are enablers for it but you card also end on Dark simorgh if you're going against a backrow heavy deck. The other one can be summoned during the Bird of ancestry shenanigan.  Now for the BIG DEAL : Harpie's feather storm. This card is NOT OKAY. Effectivly Azathot in a trap card, unfair by nature. It is sooooo good that trap trick made it's way into the main deck. Even if your whole turn was negated by handtraps or if you get Dark ruler no mored or Forbidden Droppleted, as long as you have a wind winged beast one the field and HFS set, your opponents will most likely end his turn as he won't be able to play Yugioh. Even ""normal summon barrier statue, set HFS"" is a sick turn. Pair it with Sovereignty and you have a really oppressive board. That is why that's is a mandatory 6 of. You will most likely side out your traps going second but HFS can be use as a dark ruler no more like effect when harpie conductor is on the field, in very niche scenarios.  Be careful to summon your tri-brigades before summoning back your simorgh chickens, as they lock your into winged-beast when summoned this way.  &nbsp;  Compared to ""bird up!"", this deck can't go into Zeus but compensates by having an easier access to one of the most unfair trap cards ever, the deadly ""infinite negate combo"" with union carrier and mist valley thunderbird and much more value from normal summons. Aside from this, things are pretty similar. You also get to use The bird of sovereignty's protection effect.  Let me know in the comments if you would change anything ! Enjoy chickens !"

Make the best use of Abhyss archetype, Snake","First of all, you NEVER want to go first. Your endboard will most likely suck. This deck has way more power going second. You might have seen versions with viruses and other weird lair-related stuff, it makes the deck inconsistent while having an okay-ish endboard. Sure, going first IF you can assemble all 3 of the Abhyss boss monsters, you have a decent board, but nothing crazy and you need to open some disgustingly good hand to assemble it (which this deck could as well). The payoff for going first is really low, but you can consider siding some viruses if you know your opponents is going to make you go first.  The idea is to injure the opponents board with strong equalizers before spamming your field with reptiles and accessing your Xyz 8 toolbox. Curse and Aleth make it easy with snake rain so you can end game quickly with Numeron Dragon. If you can't otk that turn, then setup your Aron and Amunesia to disrupt your opponent's follow up.  Lair of darkness is insane in this deck and so is Darkest Diabolos. You can tribute your opponent's monster to summon yours from the graveyard , which bypasses almost every kind of protection. It's one of the easier ways to get rid of problematic cards. Even Arima is nice, not only because it searches Lair, but it's effect is actually useful : you can search Nihil, Nessie, Jackalope or Diabolos depending on what you need.  Lamia, Echidna and Hydra are nice little engine that clears boards and gives you cards to work with. It doesn't interact well with targeting protection though. Be careful with Echidna, as her search effect prevents you from going into your Rank 8.  Dangers are here for ""consistency"" and they open up Xyz play. Its weird to speak about consistency with danger!s but that's what they actually do here, kind of how they did in Thunder dragon back in the days. There is just no better equivalent to ""extenders that load the graveyard and cycle through the deck"" and you need all of that. Tsuchinoko is searchable with King of the Feral Imp or Echidna, which is actually very relevant because one more monster can be crucial to tribute for your Abhyss graveyard summons.  If you don't open your equalizers, try baiting as much negates as you can, you will see that you can go through much.  The side deck is just good going second cards, but you can put whatever you like as long as you can break boards. Careful with the barrier statue of the wind, as you will need the wind insect kaiju to out it as Gameciel don't work. Be sure to pack Backrow hate as that kind of deck can become akward to deal with. As I said before, viruses can also be considered in the side for going first.  Weakness to droll&amp;lockbird,  Skullmeister, Ghost Belle and backrow heavy decks.  Some edit after more playtest : added Number 23 Lancelot and AA-Zeus, super good if you can't otk.  Let me know in the comments if you would make any changes or if you disagree with my point of view. Hell you can comment if you like the deck as well ! I truly believe this is the good route ! Enjoy !"

Pretty standard stuff, but Raider's Wing going second and Revolution Falcon give this deck the oomf it sometimes lacks.  Monsters: The first line of cards are your extenders, you want to see at least one in your opening hand (Torn Scales obviously the best). Cloak is the first card to get in your GY, and Boots is usually your last and usually not a target for Rusty or Torn Scales. Gloves is a decent extender off of Rusty's effect. Kagemucha Knight, Psychics and E-Tele (even Boots) are going to be your special summon after your starter. The six hand traps are flexible.  Spells/Traps: E-Tele gets an extender or during your opponent's turn is a free disruption (using Ghost Ogre). RUMF goes into <strong>Revolution Falcon</strong>. PK Wing is an extender. Fog Blade puts in work and ROTA and Foolish start plays.  Extra Deck: <strong>Cherubini and Rusty</strong> are cards you want to go into every time, and then Leviair if you have the resources. Break Sword goes into Dark Rebellion or Nightmare. Use your Cherubini bringing it back with Cir to go into Verte most of the time and then Dragoon. Falcon for RUMF and free pop. Accesscode Talker is your main means of OTK. Masquerena package for extra negates or to spin cards if you can't get an ideal board. Link Spider is pretty nice as it can link for Shade Brigadine to get an effect monster on field for further Extra Deck stuff and also to save you if you get Nibiru'd.  My favourite combo (ideal hand) off this deck goes Normal Torn Scales, discarding Cloak and sending Raider's Wing. Get extender on field (any Lv 3) and link into Cherubini, send Graff and Special Cir (Libic, if you drew Cir) and link away Cherubini and Cir for ya boi Rusty, sending Gloves and setting a Fog Blade. Banish Cloak adding Boots and use Torn effect to Special him. Special Boots and overlay into Levinair, detaching to special Cloak in attack, activate and target Rusty. Activate Gloves, sending PK Wing and banish Wing to Special Boots again. Overlay Boots and Cloak into Break Sword to a Rusty zone, use either his own (activate Raider's Wing first) or Rusty's effect to self-destroy and activate, bringing back any two of you PKs. Overlay them into a. Nightmare to basically deny your opponent next turn or b. Dark Rebellion to punch in for damage. Your <strong>Nightmare</strong> is basically broooooken if you use your <strong>Raider's Wing</strong>. Link away your Leviair and Cherubini to Anaconda and the next is obvious. Main 2 you banish Boots to set RUMF (one Fog Blade is usually enough, using it more than once a turn causes trouble next turn). You cause a Nightmare for your opponent their turn and once it's out of gas, you activate RUMF, banishing your Malebranche's and go into Revolution Falcon, popping your opponents only face-up or any monster.  <strong>Accesscode for game</strong>, almost 80% of the time.  You can take out the Masquerena package for the Raider's Knight to Arc Rebellion Combo and also add Almiraj in for added consistency in getting out Dragoon. <strong>Almiraj</strong> is probably the best change if you're looking to make the deck a lil' more consistent.  All in all, an insanely fun deck."

Ademais, há de se observar que foi incluida uma carta armadilha no baralho, a qual limita a quantidade de invocações para 2. A carta armadilha pode ser buscada com o XYZ Primathmech Alembertian. </span>"

Advertencia: Puedes perder amigos UwU. Make an FTK with the legendary Ex,"Deck creado por: Darklab  Objetivo: Ganar con el efecto de Exodia en el primer turno OwO.  Link a la demostración del Deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV4Y33x7nxk  Extenders para iniciar el combo: <ul>  	<li>Tour guide from the underworld: Vale x3. Trae al campo a Graff o al Edge imp (el otro lo envías al cementerio usando a Cherubini). En todo caso, es el mejor normal summon del deck.</li>  	<li>Fiendish rhino warrior: Vale x2. Envía al cementerio el mismo target que la Tour guide, aunque no aprovecha el cuerpo extra. Necesita otro extender sí o sí.</li>  	<li>Junk forward: Se invoca de modo especial desde la mano si no controlas monstruos, por lo que si lo robas, debe ser el primero en invocarse.</li>  	<li>Kagemucha knight: Se invoca de modo especial cuando invocas otro monstruo de nivel 3 de modo normal. Ojo que puede perder timing.</li>  	<li>Psychic wheelder: Se invoca si ya tienes otro monstruo de nivel 3, aunque sólo es una vez por turno.</li>  	<li>Psychic tracer: Igual que el anterior.</li>  	<li>Gilasaurus: Se invoca casi gratuitamente. Ojo que el rival puede invocar algo del cementerio, aunque usualmente eso no es un problema.</li>  	<li>Fossil dig: Trae al Gilasaurus.</li>  	<li>Foolish burial: Puedes enviar a Cloak para robar a Boots, a costa de no acceder a la ruta no segura; o en su defecto enviar uno de los targets de la Tour guide.</li>  	<li>Emergency teleport: Trae a uno de los Psychic gratis.</li> </ul> Inicio del combo: <ol>  	<li>Primero, se debe traer a Cherubini y activar su efecto. No importa si es negado, ya que lo importante es el costo de enviar al cementerio a Graff para invocar del Deck a Cir (Ojo, si Cherubini mantiene sus efectos negados, Cir se destruirá si tenemos otros monstruos, así que cuidado).</li>  	<li>Hacemos link summon con cherubini y Cir, con lo que se activará el efecto de este último y así invocaremos nuevamente a Cherubini. El monstruo link que invocaremos dependerá de la ruta que elijamos, la cual a su vez depende de cuántos extenders tengamos disponibles.</li> </ol> Ruta segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 4+. Monstruo: Apollousa): <ol>  	<li>Al tener 2 extenders extra además de los usados para invocar a Cherubini, usaremos un material link más para ir por Apollousa. Opcionalmente si hay más extenders, se le puede invocar con 4 materiales para tener las 4 negaciones, pero siempre dejando 1 para el siguiente paso. También es importante no poner demasiados cuerpos, ya que más tarde van a estorbar.</li>  	<li>Con el extender sobrante y el Cherubini revivido por el efecto de Cir, invocaremos por link a Codebreaker virus swordsman, colinkeado a Apollousa. Esto activará el efecto de invocar del Deck a Codebreaker zero day.</li>  	<li>Usamos los codebreaker para invocar a Isolde. Añadimos cualquier descarte e invocamos a Armageddon knight. Para los equipos a descartar, es importante enviar Phoenix blade (combo guerrero), Sword of sparkles (ya verán) y Cursed bamboo sword (para añadirnos una magia a la mano).</li>  	<li>Armageddon enviará a Plaguespreader zombie, el cual reviviremos con el descarte de Isolde, luego usaremos estos dos para invocar a Halqifibrax.</li>  	<li>Halqifibrax traerá a Vylon cube, y él junto con Armageddon invocarán por sincronía al Shooting riser dragon. Es importante NO ponerlo debajo de las flechas de Apollousa. Esto activará los efectos de Vylon cube (para traer un D.D.R.) y del Riser dragon (enviar al cementerio al World legacy - world chalice).</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto del Phoenix blade para desterrar a Armageddon knight y otro guerrero cualquiera para añadirlo a la mano y lo descartamos como el coste del D.D.R. para invocar al mismo Armageddon desterrado.</li>  	<li>Con el efecto de Armageddon enviamos a Zephyr al cementerio. Activamos su efecto devolviendo a la mano el D.D.R. Armageddon irá al cementerio. Repetimos el paso 6.</li>  	<li>Esta vez enviaremos al cementerio al Summoner monk. Usaremos entonces a Zephyr y Armageddon para invocar a Dugares y revivir al Summoner Monk a la otra zona donde NO apunta Apollousa.</li>  	<li>Invocamos por Link al Flame swordsman usando a Dugares y Halqifibrax, y lo sacrificamos usando el efecto de Sword of sparkles. Con eso, todas las flechas debajo de Apollousa deberían estar libres. Usamos el efecto del Summoner monk descartando la Broken bamboo sword para invocar a Rescue ferret.</li>  	<li>Con Ferret traemos a Sangan, Lee y Spore (este último puede ser cualquier tuner de nivel 1). Dejando de lado a Lee, usamos los otros 2, además del Summoner monk y el Riser dragon (ahora de nivel 2) para hacer 2 invocaciones de sincronía: Ametrix (para invocar a Dewloren) y Rose maiden (para tener el Black garden).</li>  	<li>Con Sangan añadimos la primera pieza de Exodia: La pieza de efecto (por ser la más difícil de buscar)</li>  	<li>Activamos el Black garden y haremos una invocación link con Lee y Rose maiden, trayendo a Puzzlomino (su flecha debe estar libre)</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto de Black garden para invocar al Summoner monk una vez más (no al lado de Puzzlomino)</li>  	<li>Activamos el efecto en el cementerio de la Rose maiden para traer al Riser dragon al lado de Puzzlomino y darle nivel 1 con el efecto de este último.</li>  	<li>Invocamos a Dewloren usando al Riser y Ametrix. Podemos traer el Phoenix blade a la mano una vez más para usarlo con el Summoner Monk por última vez para invocar al Treasure panda (es importante que esté en una zona a donde apunte Apollousa).</li>  	<li>Con el Treasure panda desterramos cualquier magia para invocar una pieza cualquiera de Exodia. Usamos esa pieza y a Puzzlomino para invocar a Lib y colocar el World legacy succession.</li>  	<li>Usamos a Lib y al Summoner monk para invocar a Tenyi y activamos el efecto de Lib para regresar al mismo Tenyi al Deck.</li>  	<li>Con eso, sólo debería quedar Dewloren y Treasure panda en la zona principal de monstruos. Usamos al panda para traer el resto de piezas de Exodia.</li>  	<li>Enviamos al Treasure panda al cementerio con el efecto de Lee y usamos el Succession para traer la pieza que enviamos al cementerio.</li>  	<li>Finalmente, devolvemos todas las piezas de Exodia a la mano con el efecto de Dewloren y GG.</li> </ol> Ruta parcialmente segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 3. Monstruo: Tenyi) <ol>  	<li>A diferencia de la primera ruta, sólo tenemos un extender adicional que debemos guardar para el codebreaker, así que usaremos solamente a Cherubini y Cir para invocar a Tenyi.</li>  	<li>El resto va igual hasta llegar al paso 9 de la ruta segura. En este punto, en lugar de invocar al Flame Swordsman con Halqifibrax y Dugares, usaremos ambos junto con el Tenyi para invocar a Apollousa.</li>  	<li>El combo continúa igual hasta el final. En la parte que se invoca a Tenyi usando a Lib y a Summoner monk, en su lugar invocaremos al Flame Swordsman (ya que Tenyi ya fue usado).</li> </ol> Ruta no segura (Número de extenders iniciales requerido: 2. Monstruo: Rusty bardiche) <ol>  	<li>Esta ruta debería usarse como último recurso, en caso de tener una muy mala mano o que nos hayan destruido extenders. La ventaja es que no necesitamos a Cir, por lo que podemos ir directamente por el Edge imp sabres (para devolver un garnet al Deck, o a Brigandine si lo tenemos en la mano) con Cherubini, e ir por Rusty bardiche.</li>  	<li>Usaremos a Bardiche para enviar al cementerio a Cloak y colocar a Brigandine. Removemos a Cloak y robamos a Boots.</li>  	<li>Invocamos a Boots y Brigandine, yendo directamente a por Isolde (obviaremos a los codebreaker en esta ruta).</li>  	<li>El combo continúa igual que en la ruta segura, hasta llegar al paso 9.</li>  	<li>Ya que Bardiche no puede ser usado para invocaciones link, lo sacrificaremos con el Sword of Sparkles y usaremos a Dugares y Halqifibrax para invocar a Tenyi.</li>  	<li>Seguimos igual hasta el paso 17 (Phoenix blade puede volver a la mano sin problemas, ya que reemplazamos a los codebreaker por los phantom knights en esta ruta, que también son guerreros).</li>  	<li>Usamos entonces a Lib, Summoner monk y Tenyi para invocar a Apollousa, tras lo cual sigue todo igual hasta el final.</li> </ol> Tips: <ul>  	<li>Apollousa es útil para sacar del juego casi cualquier handtrap, aprovechando que Impermanence ya no se usa mucho y que Called está a 1 copia (por ahora 7w7)</li>  	<li>Edge imp sabres y Plaguespreader zombie pueden usarse para enviar garnets en tu mano de vuelta al Deck. Algunos garnets que debes devolver serían los targets de Rescue Ferret o Armageddon Knight y alguna carta de equipo (en caso de robar 3 con nombres distintos y que no sean D.D.R.)</li>  	<li>Si tienes el Sword of sparkles, puedes descartarlo en el primer uso del Summoner monk, o si tienes el Phoenix blade, equípaselo al Armageddon knight cuando lo invocas por primera vez para que vaya al cementerio.</li>  	<li>Si tienes al Armageddon knight en tu mano, puedes invocar en su lugar al Dark grepher y usar su efecto para descartar al Armageddon knight, a la vez que envías al Plaguespreader zombie al cemenerio.</li>  	<li>Si robas a Sangan, puedes usarlo como normal summon, añadir a Exodia cuando se vaya al cementerio, y más adelante reemplazarlo por cualquier otro monstruo de nivel 3.</li>  	<li>Si robas el Black garden, puedes usarlo como coste del Summoner monk, ya que el efecto de Rose maiden lo añadirá del cementerio a tu mano más adelante.</li>  	<li>No es posible realizar el combo con sólo 1 extender, pero las posibilidades de que sólo saques 1 o ninguno son cerca del 1% (sí, saqué las cuentas)</li> </ul> Pros: <ul>  	<li>Deck extremadamente consistente, sólo brickea alrededor del 1% de las veces.</li>  	<li>Versátil. Se adapta fácilmente a los recursos que tengamos en mano.</li>  	<li>Protegido constantemente por Apollousa, por lo que es difícil de contrarrestarlo una vez toca el campo.</li>  	<li>No depende del burn, por lo que no le afectan cartas como Ghost sister u otras que le permitan ganar LP al oponente.</li>  	<li>No requiere demasiados recursos para realizar el combo. Con 2 extenders es suficiente, y tener más solamente lo hace mejor.</li>  	<li>Puede baitear hantraps tempranas con los extenders suficientes.</li> </ul> Contras: <ul>  	<li>A pesar de ser consistente, tiene muchos garnets, por lo que es posible comenzar con 3+ garnets en mano, en cuyo caso es un gg automático.</li>  	<li>Debe ser efectuado al detalle. Si se falla en un pequeño detalle, muy probablemente el campo se llene de monstruos inútiles. Una parte importante del Deck es por eso, deshacerse de lo que estorba con Sword of Sparkles, Lib y Lee. Además, las posiciones donde se invoca algunos monstruos son muy importantes.</li>  	<li>Aún teniendo protección, el Deck es susceptible a Nibiru, Impermanence y Called by the grave si son usados correctamente.</li>  	<li>Si destruyen a Cherubini antes de activar su efecto y no hay forma de invocarlo del cementerio, también es gg.</li> </ul>"

Also was not able to add a third Mathematician because of some bug but it's supposed to be in there. Some people might also be asking why Gravedigger's Trap Hole is in here. Well it should be no secret at this point that a lot of monster effects nowadays are activated from the hand and from the graveyard. This is a really cool way to counter handtraps or disrupt a graveyard set up and also to deal some nice damage, which helps you to OTK quicker or might even win the game for you. For an example, when your opponent is clinging to his last couple of life points after a successful battle phase of yours and plans a comeback which involves a combo that either activates a monster effect in the graveyard or the hand (a lot of them do) and then BOOM. Not sure how well this does against tournament decks since I've not been able to try competitive play because of Skull Convoy but I've played against a couple of meta relevant decks and it actually does quite well. Try it out"

Hope you like it :D.,"A pretty simple Lunalight deck without tiger (sadly ._.) that aims to put big numbers on the field that the opponent can't do anything about.  The deck mainly follows these rules: <ul>  	<li>Try to get to Leo dancer using monsters on-field/in-hand first, then use wolf to make either panther dancer or sabre dancer, depending on the situation. It's important to banish chick when making that fusion, so you can win uninterrupted.</li>  	<li>Throw down wolf as soon as possible after baiting negations.</li>  	<li>Chick dumps either panther dancer or yellow marten for lunalight fusion. This is flexible, you might want to dump butterfly or emerald bird depending on the situation.</li>  	<li>Emerald bird usually dumps marten if it's in hand, otherwise dumps any monster. You don't want to get rid of a lunalight fusion unless you've already used it that turn, or have drawn into both. The more fusion spells the better since chick/tenyi can create so much advantage.</li>  	<li>Foolish burial usually dumps serenade dance and not perfume. All flexible, of course. Before getting leo dancer, this deck doesn't have a single linear plan to get there, you just have to use what you drew into.</li> </ul> I've seen some lists that run many blue cat's, but I've found it pretty uncommon to pull it's effect off, so I've decided to run it at one. Same with butterfly, it's effect isn't a necessity for most games. Emerald bird and/or yellow marten can help you go into tiger king, which has come in clutch a couple of times.  I've tried to put reasoning and foolish burial into this deck, but surprisingly have never drawn into them, so that might be something you'd want to put in by dropping an emerald bird if you want. You never really go into your link monsters except predaplant verde, they're just to prepare for different situations as the fusion monsters are the main bosses. I've found infinite impermanence is a great hand trap for this deck, as it also negates a spell/trap, but you can replace it with whatever hand trap you want, of course.  Edits: <ul>  	<li>Swapped out blue cat and the crimson foxes for another butterfly, another marten, and have moved the twin twisters to the side deck in favor of three lightning storms. Butterfly accomplishes what fox and cat are trying to do without targeting, and marten can bounce back a pendulum to go into an xyz. Cards like shaddoll schism with non-targeting non-removal can be a real pain.</li>  	<li>Took out the predaplant fusion for tornado dragon. The lunalights are good enough boss monsters, and tornado dragon is easy to bring out with marten for backrow removal in case you've already used tenki.</li>  	<li>Took out ghost ogre in favor of alpha in side deck. I'm not sure how kaiju's would be in this deck, I'll test that later.</li>  	<li>Added alpha into the main deck by taking out a polymerization and a lightning storm. It synergizes pretty well with marten in theory, but I have yet to pull that off in-game. Otherwise, it's a pretty good removal tool.</li>  	<li>Replaced the alphas missing in the side deck with a crimson fox and a raigeki. You can summon massive 4,000+ monsters and have removal, but if they have an even bigger monster, you surprisingly cannot do anything without crimson fox, so just in case it's there if you need it.</li>  	<li>Added foolish burial in the main deck. Literally have no idea why I wasn't running it before, it opens up perfume, white rabbit, extra material for wolf, or a free lunalight fusion by dumping marten. Before it would be more difficult to get perfume in the grave, one game I used butterfly on a marten in order to summon it with perfume and get a search, but now it's a lot easier.</li>  	<li>Discovered the droll &amp; lock bird wasn't in the side deck bc I had the alt artwork in the ydk file, so I added that.</li> </ul> &nbsp;"
