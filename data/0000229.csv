Typically as long as you have a spell or trap with a claw in your hand or core to search out realm to then pull claw from the deck you can easily get into your boss monster I did have cards like the buster whelp that when equipped stops my opponent from special summoning which didn't really see play but I could have not used this as effectively as possible.  Overall I'm really looking for some veterans to help see what I can put into this deck to make it more viable and well rounded Any suggestions really.  Other than that if you find this deck please note I did run it without Zeus and dragoon and still played really great games so have fun with it :)"

One of the ways to do it is summoning Gustav Max, use its effect, and summon juggernout liebe.  <strong>Useful Extra Deck Cards:</strong>  summon <strong>phantom fortress</strong> to banish opponent cards.  Use <strong>Earth Slicer</strong> to angry your opponent.  use the <strong>Galaxy Destroyer</strong> to destroy opponent spell &amp; trap cards.  Use the <strong>Sky Palace</strong> to destroy.  use <strong>Goliath</strong> to revive the Infinitrack XYZ.  Use <strong>Anger Knuckle</strong> if you want to summon lvl 10 monsters.  do not use <strong>Megaclops... it's there only for decoration.</strong>  &nbsp;  Useful Monsters:  <strong>Metalcruncher</strong> can be used to search any machine monster, so start w that one.  <strong>Express Knight</strong> can be normal without tributing.  <strong>Derricane &amp; express</strong> can be special easily.  <strong>Crab Cane</strong> can bring up the rank up.  <strong>Brutal Dozer</strong> can special summon a infinitrack monster.  <strong>tunneller</strong> works like a pot of avarice for machines.  <strong>anchor drill</strong> can special summon from the hand (and bring a rank 9 if you use it smartly).  <strong>railroad stampede</strong> special summons from the graveyard.  <strong>harvester</strong> can search an infinitrack monster (and do the same that drill does).  useful spells:  special schedule can be used to bring back an XYZ monster from the grave.  urgent schedule (everyone knows what this thing does).  Heavy Forward can search an infinitrack monster (good to avoid bricks) and be used as material.  Outrigger Extension. The rank up, 'while this card is face up on the field your opponent cannot target XYZ machine monsters you control with card effects'  Revolving switchyard is the booster spell. summons a monster and turns its lvl into 10.  useful traps  spin turn: just destroys.  barrage blast: destroys.  crusher run: destroys, and can search the spin turn or the rank up.  Note: the side deck is only if u wanna tribute ur opponent monsters.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

This deck consists of specially summoning Shadow Mist to add a Mask Change and/or summoning Woodsman and adding a Polymerization and summoning some HERO from the extra deck.  Hero's Bond is a great way to summon Shadow Mist to have a Mask Change, Hero Signal is a great way to summon a Stratos, Shadow Mist or Woodsman to activate the effect that suits you best, without many support cards of the HERO archetype, this one deck doesn't have much offensive or even defensive power, but I think it's even pretty strong for a protagonist deck"

What you're looking at here is an Albaz Dinosaurs deck, including one of the best Fusion spells in the game, Branded Fusion! Branded Fusion allows you to Fusion Summon a monster using monsters from your hand, field, and even Deck, as long as one of the Fusion Materials for that Fusion Monster is ""Fallen of Albaz"".  As for this deck's name, ""Indominus the Untamable Dragon"" is a reference to one of the dinosaurs from Jurassic World, <em>Indominus Rex</em>, whose name is Latin for ""<em>Untamable King</em>."" It also keeps in theme with the Albaz fusions' names.  For this deck, your strategy is to summon UCT and other monsters. You can use Branded Fusion to summon Rubellion the Divineflame Dragon, and send Overtex Qoatlus and Albaz as fusion material. Then you can use Qoatlus's effect to search Double Evolution Pill, and then activate it to summon UCT.  If you're going first, your goal is to either sit on Dolkka and UCT, or use the combo I mentioned above <em><strong>and</strong></em> Rubellion's effect to sit on UCT and Predaplant Dragostepelia.

Two increase, tried playing 1 but i bricked on it too much, It is worth having the second one in ur deck so you have the faris line always avaliable since you can pitch increase in hand anyway.  Two stratos and one e call. Two stratos is more than enough , you can get away with playing one with pot of prosperity but without prosperities its better to play two stratos and an e call to keep the consistency up.  Not playing solid soilder bc of imperms/veiler being in the format , it just isn't worth getting its effect being negated.  Playing alot of d heros in the main because without prosperity its better to play more. With vyon being the best normal in the deck drawing vyon and another d hero can get you to Phoenix enforcer in under 5 summons. IE Normal Vyon , sent shadow mist , search mali, banish mist get poly, use d hero in hand and mali in hand to get the phoenix enforcer.  DRAW HAND IS BROKEN - draw hand is insane you can use it to force dark law rip and with droll you can lock them out of their main deck, also when playing under nib, u can revive draw hand in their stanby and with mask change make dark law on their turn.  NO MIRACLE FUSION . Evil heros are so much better than playing the miracle fusion/sunriser it takes up two main deck spots vs 1 but you clear up so much more of the extra deck for yourself. Also under There can only be one you can get the bane out bc its a fiend and try to set urself up with a fusion warrior monster.  EXTRA DECK : masked heros are pretty standard. We play anki bc he can kill pretty easily since we play chalice, you can do the duel links damage step chalice play to attack people for alot of damage. Also i do not play ab zero but i still play the masked hero to just clear out back row against backrow decks.  SIDE DECK  IMPORTANT!!For games two/three you should side out the e call so if you dont get drolled on the e call!!  SIDING MAINLY THINK ABOUT DROLL AND NIB , they hurt the deck the most. practice playing against them when you test the deck.  Siding going first you side in all 6 traps. remember you cannot use appointer if you have no cards in hand, also use appointer in DP or SP to rip out board breaking cards or important combo pieces.  siding in droll is good for using draw hand and dark law to keep them out of their main deck."

My take on Unchained. I have been playing the archetype for a while now (about a year). Hope you enjoy, and please let me know if you have suggestions for improvements! <strong>--- introduction ---</strong>  <strong>--- ratios main ---</strong> The following ratios are so standard in any build/variation of unchained, that I am not going to spend any time explaining them. 3x rakea 3x aruha 3x sarama 2x unchained soul 1x unchained soul of disaster 3x abominations prison 3x extravagance 2/3x abominable chamber of the unchained 3x escape of the unchained  3x unchained soul of rage 3x unchained soul of anguish 2x knightmare unicorn 1/2x accesscode  As for the other ratios, I will place a couple of comments for those who are interested. 2x ash blossom - Optional. Goes well with extravagance, trying to establish card advantage. 2x ghost belle - Optional. I like ghost belle a lot because (1) I think it is a great card overal (2) there is niche synergy with the weaknesses of the deck. For example, ice dragons prison can hurt the deck a lot, but so can cards that banish/steal your resources from the graveyard like called by grave, naelshaddoll, shark cannon and others. 1x called by grave - Goes well with extravagance, trying to establish clear card advantage. 2x abominable chamber of the unchained - Controversial maybe. But the games where I open say 2x unchained traps without any of the monsters I straight out lose. This is to minimize such bricky hands. I have been digging this ratio really well when testing, especially in combination with trap trick, which I will talk about later. 3x imperm - Personal preference. I feel this card is important to discuss because It directly conflicts with the gamma package/fantastical dragon phantazmay, which became popular for unchained quite recently. I think the card is so generic that it is worth it. OK going 1st. VERY good going 2nd (dealing with floodgates + backrow negates). 2x ice dragons prison - Amazing card. Leave out the non targeting banish 2 and I still think its a great card, just to put the strength of the card in perspective. Also, it outs dragoon which is this decks cryptonite. 3x torrential tribute - Konami might as well have named the card unchained torrential tribute. I would have played this card at 6 if I could. Let me just mention 1 of the 100 nice deck interations. If you have rage on the board + TT, then you can link into anguish, blow the board up afterwards (or later during the turn), and take sarama to hand for a strong follow up. 2x trap trick - (2nd) Best card in the deck. My favourite play is to activate the card in end phase to set escape of the unchained to then pop backrow your opponent just set, with a potential follow up of summoning abominable for another pop, once again, still in end phase. 1x skill drain - BEST card in deck, hands down. (1) You have three 3k ATK targets you can summon from deck. (2) All your monsters trigger in GY anyway, so worst case scenario you can crash your monsters, something you will doing anyway if you play the deck for more than a day. 1x imperial order  1x unchained abomination - We all know you will almost never make this. 95% of the time accesscode is better, the other 5 percent is probably your eldlich matchup. 1x topologic bomber dragon - Interesting link target against any link based deck (salamangreat, @ignister, cyberse, etc). 2x divine arsenal aa-zeus - I'll leave you to reading the 4 xyz monsters. One important remark to place here is that I ONLY, I repeat ONLY, go for this play if I already have soul of rage on board. Because even though zeus is a great monster, its not worth sending all your OWN backrow too if you dont really need to. <strong>--- ratios ---</strong>  <strong>--- ratios side ---</strong> I blind 2nd after game 1. Just a few small comments below.  3x evenly matched - Best card in side. I literally don't think it is physically possible to OTK with this deck anyway, given the fiend lock you are in mostly. Generic af. 3x dark ruler - See comment above. Synergizes well with unchained of disaster too. Generic af too. 1x pankratops - Goes well with evenly matched, given you can tribute the pankratops if you really have too. Generic af too. 2x kaiju - Same reasoning as dark ruler no more. I chose wind kaiju because I hate wind barrier statue. --- ratios side ---"

I will get straight to it with this one.  The fishborgs, along with most of the main deck monsters, have ways of bringing back themselves or others, hence why I call this a recursion themed deck. The spells and traps support the low level water monsters with more recursion and protection, as well as some removal to fully benefit from effects that bring monsters back. The extra deck is where you will see the monsters that are actually threatening to your opponent, with monsters like Gishilnodon able to make serious dents if left unchecked. Lastly, aero shark can make use of the fishborg monsters banishing themselves, along with the other cards banishing your monsters, in order to inflict some mildly irritating burn (this should not be your primary game plan, it is more of a side option).  So that's it. There may be some room for improvement, so feel free to let me know what could be changed. Adios, nerds."

I'm still thinking if whether I should still play both the Shiranui Squire and Spectralsword Shade in the main deck since I also have a copy of ""Ghost Meets Girl - A Mayakashi Manuscript"" to combo with Shiranui Squiresaga and to transcend into Sunsaga but for now it'll still remain in the deck until I figure out what cards would be good to replace them. As for the handtraps I do plan on running at least 2 copies of Ash Blossoms &amp; Joyous Springs even though I only have the 1 copy yet still unsure if whether I should bump it up to 3 copies or if I should also run 2 copies of Ghost Belle into the main deck rather than the side deck but other than that I'll just leave it as it is. In addition to handtraps, I also plan on running 3 copies of Infinite Impermanence although still unsure about the ratio for it since I've seen other people run only 2 copies of Imperm in their deck.  &nbsp;  As for the Extra Deck nothing really has changed much, although just recently I managed to pull a copy of Super Polymerization from the Maximum Gold set recently but I don't really have a super poly target at the moment so I'll just put it to the side until I find one. Lastly for the side deck I am running 2 copies of Ghost Belle and 1 copy of Ghost Ogre. I do also have a copy of Artifact Lancea which I also pulled from Maximum Gold but I'm not sure if I should also include it into the deck and the same goes for Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hope you guys could give me feedbacks on how I could improve the deck as well as in terms of cards ratio, tech cards and etc."

So, I made this deck, utilizing (almost) all of the Red-Eyes archetype, excluding those dumb Zombie Dragons. I only included one <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon since I wanted to be able to use </a><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion for other things. Also, </a><a data-name=""Archfiend Black Skull Dragon"">Archfiend Black Skull Dragon isn't in this deck since I wanted to keep it strictly Red-Eyes, and it also was hitting the upper limit. Anyways, if you see any way to improve this deck, please put it into the comments, and I'll take it into consideration. Best of luck on your next duel!</a>"

Despias are Dark Fairy cards; just like Darklords, and they focus heavily on fusion summoning- which Darklords also rely on. This makes summoning The First Darklord incredibly easy. In addition to that, most of the Despia cards also have graveyard effects, which help you either protect, reuse, or gain resources. Darklords normally lack reliable consistency and recoverability, so the Despia engine makes up for that.  <span>III. Key Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> - This is the main beater of the deck and can be used offensively as well as defensively. Aside from board wiping, he can protect Fairy monsters from targeted effects and also act as a secondary <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a>, or special summon from the hand. Your prime targets will likely be <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> from the grave or <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> from the grave or hand. You can also use this effect during your opponent's turn- which can combo with Kristya or <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> - One of the best searchers in the deck; searches a Branded spell or trap when normal or special summoned. 80% of the time you'll use this effect to search for <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> , the main fusion spell of the deck. He can also recur himself from the graveyard when one of your fusions are destroyed and negate one of your opponent's monsters for a turn.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> - This is your main setup card for fusion, link, and xyz summons. Superbia's ability isn't a once per turn effect, so it's always a prime revival target for <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> and <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a>. (Of note: A copied Darklord Contact from the graveyard will not proc Superbia's effect upon revival as the timing will be missed. In addition, the timing will also be missed if he is revived by The First Darklord during a <em>chain</em>).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> - This card synergizes incredibly well with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> since it gives 2/3 material for <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> or a free <a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a>.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> - A very multifaceted fusion card; can be activated during your turn or your opponent's turn since it's a quick-play spell. It does require a discard to activate- so make sure you save a card to discard to the graveyard.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a> - Combos incredibly well with your other high level fusions; he reduces all monster ATK points to 0 aside from level 8 or higher fusion monsters. This card also interacts very strangely with <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> . When Quaeritis' effect ends, all monsters reset to their original attack points. In the case of Apollousa, her original attack points will reset to whatever it was when she was summoned. Meaning if she started with 3200 ATK and negated 3 times- lowering her ATK by 2400, by the end of Quaeritis' effect- it will temporarily lower her ATK to 0 and then reset back to 3200.</li> </ul> <span>IV. Tech Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> - One of the most versatile cards of the deck, it can be used to set up or trigger combos. Your prime targets of this card will be <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> , <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> , <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> , and <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> - Does 2 things: searches a Despia monster when sent to the graveyard or banished and it can banish itself from the graveyard to recycle a Branded spell/trap to the hand. This will be your main target for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> since it turns Allure into a +1 once it's banished. Its search effect can be triggered off of <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> , <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> , <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> , <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> , and anytime it's used as fusion material.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> - Your main lockdown card for your opponent...as well as yourself; prevents all special summoning. Can recycle a fairy from your graveyard if you're able to special summon it with its effect- which isn't too difficult if you have <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> setting up your grave. You can also special summon Kristya from your hand if you control <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> .</li>  	<li><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> - The only real handtrap that I run in this deck. It's good for baiting <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> or <a data-name=""Droll and Lock Bird"">Droll and Lock Bird</a> when most of your combo starters are spells or monster effects. On an opening hand, Gamma can help negate handtraps against: <a data-name=""Banishment of the Darklords"">Banishment of the Darklords</a> , <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> 's draw effect , <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> , <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> , <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> , and <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> 's graveyard effect. If you are able to use its effect, it'll also fill your field with fusion or link material. This card is also a Light monster, so it can be freely used for any Despian fusion if it becomes dead in the hand.  Some people might also prefer using <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> , but I don't like the idea of discarding 2 when you're fusion summoning a lot from the hand.</li> </ul> <span>V. Combos</span>  <strong><a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> </strong> <ul>  	<li>Ideally you want to weed out the possibility of getting Ash Blossomed before attempting this combo. <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> does 2 things: it gives you a <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> target on your opponent's side of the field and it gives you a free search for a Darklord monster. As long as you can get a 3rd monster on the field (usually by reviving from the graveyard), you can get <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> very easily and then start to revive your monsters again. This combo is centered around The First Darklord's ability to swarm and protect your field rather than board wiping your opponent.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a></strong> <ul>  	<li>As mentioned earlier, Quaeritis and Apollousa have a strange interaction when they're both on the field. This combo effectively resets Apollousa's ATK stat after using her negates. You want to use Quaeritis' ability to reduce all monsters' ATK to 0 after Apollousa uses all of her negates during the Main Phase. During the end phase, all monsters have their ATK reset to their <strong>original</strong> values. Meaning, if Apollousa had 3200 ATK when summoned and she used 3 negates to bring her ATK down to 800, you can use Quaeritis' effect to reduce her ATK to 0 temporarily and then when his effect ends- Apollousa will go back to her original 3200 ATK value. The goal is to loop Apollousa's attack infinitely so that you keep refreshing her ability to throw out negates. In order to add extra protection for this- you can link summon Apollousa using <a data-name=""I:P Masquerena"">I:P Masquerena</a> during your opponent's turn to make her immune to card effect destruction. 2 monsters with 0 ATK can't destroy each other by battle, but if you want more protection, you can also XYZ summon <a data-name=""Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy"">Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</a> so that your opponent is forced to target it for attacks.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a></strong> <ul>  	<li>This combo is a bit niche, but can be both offensive and defensive. <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a> allows you to tribute monsters from the graveyard instead of the field, which can help pave the way for things that can't be special summoned like <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a>. Offensively, it's an additional tribute summon that can bring things like Darklord Morningstar to the field or a second Darklord Superbia/Zerato for rank 8 XYZ plays. This also works around <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> if you have it on the field since this wouldn't be considered a special summon. Defensively, <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> is also able to use its normal summoning quick effect during your <em>opponent's</em> turn, meaning you could tribute summon <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> from your hand after your opponent finishes summoning their monsters during the main phase. Afterward, you can use Morningstar's ability to swarm Darklords to your side of the field based on the number of effect monsters your opponent controls.</li> </ul> <strong><a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> &amp; Any Revival Effect</strong> <ul>  	<li>Like I mentioned before, Darklord Superbia's ability to revive an additional fairy from the graveyard <u>is not a once per turn effect</u>. Meaning you can continuously revive it from the graveyard and still proc its effect. The exception is if you copy a <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> from the graveyard using monsters like <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a>- as the timing for Superbia's effect would be missed. In terms of this deck, there are 2 ways to revive Superbia for its effect: <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> (from the hand) and <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> . If you're lucky enough to have access to both revival effects in a turn, your board will be well protected with extra deck monsters such as Hope Harbinger Dragon and Apollousa Bow of the Goddess .</li> </ul> <span>VI. Tips and Tricks</span> <ol>  	<li>If you don't have <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> in hand, try to weed out Ash Blossom as quickly as possible depending on your strategy for the turn. <ol>  	<li>If you're planning to go the Indulged-Super Poly route, use other draw/search cards to bait such as <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> or <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> . Typically you really don't want to get Ash Blossomed on <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a>.</li>  	<li>If you don't have <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> in hand, you could bait with Indulged Darklord and use a different combo depending on what you have in hand.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>This deck does a slightly better job of going first compared to second.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> is an insanely good card to use for setting up fusion summons, but keep in mind you are locked into nothing but fusions for the rest of the turn; you will not be able to go into links or xyz after playing this. <ol>  	<li>In addition, this is also a good card to have in the graveyard as it offers protection to your high level fusion monsters.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>When looking for monsters to banish for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a>, usually I'd go with <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> first and foremost, followed by more expendable dark monsters such as <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> , <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> , or <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a> .</li>  	<li>Your general goal in every duel is to find a way to get to <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> so that you can search for <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> . <ol>  	<li><a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> and <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> are both ways you can easily search for Aluber.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>Watch how you play <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>, it locks both you and your opponent from special summoning.</li>  	<li>Most of your Rank 8 XYZ plays will come from overlaying <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> and <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> . When detaching materials- detach Superbia first to continue chaining revives.</li>  	<li>When siding things out of your deck for more handtraps or disruptions, some easy targets to side out are <a data-name=""Darklord Ukoback"">Darklord Ukoback</a> , <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum of Despia</a> , <a data-name=""Branded in Red"">Branded in Red</a> , <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> if playing against decks like Floowandereeze, and the PSY-Framegear package if it isn't working.</li>  	<li>I run a lot of 2-ofs in this deck, so some can be bumped up to 3 or down to 1 or 0 depending on what's needed. <ol>  	<li>If it's easily searchable I usually run 2 or lower, otherwise I run 3 if I really want to see something in my opening hand.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span><strong>Handtraps to look out for</strong></span>: <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> , <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> , <a data-name=""Dimension Shifter"">Dimension Shifter</a> , and <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> .</li> </ol> <span>VII. Addressing Weaknesses </span> <ol>  	<li>This deck relies heavily on having cards both in your hand as well as your graveyard. Being unable to revive your cards from the graveyard because they were banished instead definitely hurts. It's for this reason that I put <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> in my side deck- it prevents monsters being banished during your opponent's turn, which helps your Darklords especially. Despia monsters in general don't mind being banished since some of their effects activate there, but it's better to have them in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>This should be self explanatory, but you're doing a lot of special summoning to go into your fusion monsters and links. If you notice that your opponent is running <a data-name=""Nibiru the Primal Being"">Nibiru the Primal Being</a>, you can stick to the main beaters of your deck without going into your extra deck. <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> and <a data-name=""Darklord Zerato"">Darklord Zerato</a> can definitely hold their own on the field, especially if you have Darklord spells and traps in the graveyard.</li>  	<li>With all the draw and search power you're doing, it's inevitable that your opponent will catch on that the deck is very weak to <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> . This deck can play around Ash Blossom just fine, but you'll find yourself starved for resources if you get Droll &amp; Locked.</li> </ol> <span>VIII. Side Deck &amp; Other Deck Options</span> <ol>  	<li>In general, I try to avoid playing more than 3-4 handtraps since they tend to brick hands in Darklord decks. The notable 3-ofs that I have are <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> to prevent banishment, <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a> to stop multiple searches and floodgates, and <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> for some more added protection going 2nd. <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> is also a good handtrap to side instead of Droll &amp; Lock Bird . <ol>  	<li>Both <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> and <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> can be used for Despia fusion summoning since they are both Light monsters.</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>For the 2-ofs, I have <a data-name=""Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju"">Radian, the Multidimensional Kaiju</a> for cards that are difficult to get rid of and <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> for more spell/trap removal. <ol>  	<li>Radian can be fodder for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> if needed and it can also be used for Despia fusion or <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> .</li> </ol> </li>  	<li>For 1-ofs, I go with <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> for more spell/trap removal and <a data-name=""Darklord Rebellion"">Darklord Rebellion</a> for more card destruction.</li>  	<li>Some other good options to put in your side deck are <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> , <a data-name=""Crossout Designator"">Crossout Designator</a> , <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> , <a data-name=""Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit"">Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit</a> , or <a data-name=""Rivalry of the Warlords"">Rivalry of the Warlords</a> .</li> </ol>"

OTK with minimal effort. Has a slight ol' skool feel to it.,"<span>What you are looking at might be the strongest deck I've ever constructed. At least for a deck that doesn't rely on absurd amounts of Special Summons, multiple <span>Link Summons</span>, a field full of monsters, and 15+ cards in the Graveyard on the first turn of the duel. That kind of meta-play ruins the game for me. This is a bit more old school, calling back to the olden days when <span>Ritual Monsters</span> were the big bad bosses you had to watch out for. There is a bit of <strong>XYZ Summoning</strong> that can be done here, and the <span>Ritual Monsters</span> included are fairly new, but for a deck that plays like traditional Yugioh back when the Extra Deck was called the <span>Fusion</span> Deck, it gets the job done.</span>  <span>The theme of this deck is the <span>Ritual Summoning</span> of 3 of the most broken <span>Ritual Monsters</span> I could find, each with ways to bypass the opponent's defenses and inflict damage in some sort of way. If the Rituals cannot be performed early for whatever reason, there are plenty of ways to get monsters with 2950+ ATK on the field. This review won't be as complicated as many of my others, as literally half of the deck prepares and initiates the Rituals. The other half is various types of support, such as Life Point protection, Graveyard recovery, and Special Summoning.</span>  <span>The 3 <span>Ritual Monsters</span> are <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon</span>, <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span>, and <span>Shinato, King Of A Higher Plane</span>. All are <span>Ritual Summoned</span> by <span>Advanced Ritual Art</span>, which requires you to send Normal Monsters from the Deck (rather than your hand) to the Graveyard, whose <span>Levels</span> equal <span>8</span>. (Each of the <span>Ritual Monsters</span> are <span>Level 8</span>). For the Rituals, you have access to 3 <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragons</span>, 3 <span>Rabidragons</span>, and 2 <span>Alexandrite Dragons</span>, all at <span>Level 8</span>, meaning you only have to send 1 monster at a time, with the latter being <span>Level 4</span>, requiring both. You'll likely never use both <span>Alexandrite Dragons</span> for a Ritual, but it is a possibility. Just be sure to choose <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span> as the monster when <span>Ritual Summoning Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon</span>, as it's effect requires that monster to be sent in order to activate. The other 2 have no specific requirement other than the <span>Level</span>.</span>  <span>As mentioned earlier, each <span>Ritual Monster</span> can punch through defensive lines and inflict damage in different ways. <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon</span>, assuming it's effect has successfully been activated, upon declaring an attack can change the Battle Positions of as many of your opponent's monsters as you want, and upon doing so, their ATK and DEF becomes 0, and the dragon inflicts piercing damage through defending monsters. <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span> just laughs at defense, and inflicts double piercing damage to your opponent's Life Points. The most I've managed to do with a single attack is 7200. So long as your Ritual was not negated, disposing of these monsters is very difficult for your opponent to accomplish, as these 2 dragons cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects. They are also blessed with 3000 and 4000 ATK respectively. The final blue-card monster, <span>Shinato, King Of A Higher Plane</span>, inflicts damage equal to the ATK of whatever Defense Position monster it has just slain. Both dragons are objectively better, but I have managed to get an FTK using <span>Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon</span> and <span>Shinato <span>multiple times</span></span>. You can run more copies of the dragons if you want, I just keep <span>Shinato</span> in here because he has been in this deck since it's birth, before I discovered the Chaos Dragons.</span>  <span>To prepare the Rituals which Summon these nigh unstoppable wyverns, we have the help of 3 very important monsters: <span>Sonic Bird</span>, <span>Senju Of The Thousand Hands</span>, and <span>Manju Of The Ten Thousand Hands</span>. These monsters are searchers, and can begin their search upon being Normal Summoned. <span>Sonic Bird</span> nets you one of your <span>Advanced Ritual Arts</span>, <span>Senju</span> grabs a Ritual Monster, and <span>Manju</span> can get you 1 of either. Always try to use <span>Sonic Bird</span> or <span>Senju</span> first, as <span>Manju</span> is more flexible, and has more hands, lol. You can also use the Field Spell <span>Ritual Sanctuary</span> to grab one of the necessary Ritual cards from the Deck by discarding a Spell Card. This card can also be used to recycle Spell Cards by Special Summoning either <span>Senju</span> or <span>Manju</span> from the Graveyard.</span>  <span>Now it's time to cover the <strong>XYZ Monsters</strong> lurking in the Extra Deck. Once your Ritual searchers have fulfilled their destiny, they can be used to <strong>XYZ Summon Daigusto Emeral</strong>. This crazy looking guy is the only <span>Rank 4</span> monster, and being Limited, we only have 1 copy. He has 2 effects you can choose from to activate once per turn. He lets you shuffle 3 monsters from the Graveyard into the deck to draw a card, or the more desired option, lets you Special Summon 1 Normal Monster from your Graveyard. Didn't you just send a <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span> there from the deck a few seconds ago? How convenient! The other 3 <strong>XYZ monsters</strong> are <span>Rank 8</span>, and can easily be Summoned by utilizing the over-abundance of Special Summoning <span>Level 8</span> monsters, which we'll cover next. <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> (geez, what a mouthful), is probably the least used, but can be used well when the situation arises. In a nutshell, it can negate a Spell and turn it into an XYZ Material once per turn, can change itself into the attack target by detaching 1 material, and can transfer ATK between <strong>XYZ Monsters</strong> if one dies. <strong>Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon</strong> is probably the most used, and for good reasons. By detaching a material, you can negate the effects of all other Monsters on the field, and their ATK/DEF are reverted to their original states. If you do this, this monster gains 1000 ATK and can attack a second time if any of your opponent's card effects resolve. DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU HAVE YOUR <span>RITUAL MONSTERS</span> ACTIVE, unless you know 100% certain that you can secure the victory this turn. Lastly, we have <strong>Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon</strong> (these names though...), who can be summoned by using <strong>Number 107</strong> as material. Doing this immediately gives this guy 3 materials to work with. This behemoth of a dragon has 4000 ATK, and an excellent destruction effect which is activated by detaching material.</span>  <span>Finally, let's break down the support cards and end this review. For Special Summons, we have <span>Ancient Rules</span>, which can be used to Special Summon <span>Blue-Eyes White Dragon</span>, or <span>Rabidragon</span>, making the Battle Phase go smoothly, or setup <strong>XYZ Summons</strong>. We also have <span>Silver's Cry</span> and <span>Call Of The Haunted</span>, both of which can bring your <span>Level 8</span> Dragons back from the dead. Since <span>Silver's Cry</span> is a Quick-Play Spell, both of these can be used to scare your opponent during their Battle Phase just when they thought they had the upper hand. <span>Ritual Buster</span> completely shuts down your opponent's ability to do literally anything if you can successfully perform a <span>Ritual Summon</span>. <span>Swords Of Revealing Light</span> is used to stall while you obtain Ritual resources, and also protects your <span>Level 4</span> effect monsters from being killed; their low ATK's of 1400 make them easy targets, plus, you are better off using them to <strong>XYZ Summon Daigusto Emeral</strong>. The final card is <span>Dust Tornado</span>. Destroy some Spells/Traps.</span>  <span>If you're looking for a relatively simple to use deck that revolves around <span>Ritual Summoning</span>, then give this one a try. If you can get either Chaos Dragon out on the field, you'll either witness your opponent become a sweaty try-hard, or watch the life in their eyes fade in the most satisfying way imaginable, as they quickly realize that all they can do is play a monster and take the damage regardless of the position they place it in. This deck struggles against negate heavy decks, but in a more traditional, non-meta style casual play, this is one of the brutes. As always, feel free to share any ideas/strategies you may have, and I'll look into them.</span>"

Cross your fingers and hope Possessed Partnership doesn't get banished or negated so that you can revive your backrow. Or you can get some Solemn Judgments, Metaverse, and pitch Ichirin while running another Secret Village. I didn't because I want this deck to be cheap.  &nbsp;"
