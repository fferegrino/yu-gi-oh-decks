Also, the use of into the void as a draw card isnt strictly necessary. You can also replace it with other options such as upstart goblin, chicken game, or pot cards (though I wouldnt recommend the ones that banish cards)  &nbsp;  Now go forth and get this accursed card banned"

So, the deck is a pretty simple, straightforward Tri-Brigade deck with a small Zoo splash. I'd call the deck aggressively midrange: Appollousa - Pass really shouldn't be as good as this is, but Revolt is an insane card. You also have some pretty wild combos, and often they rely on only 1 or 2 cards to have high impact, meaning we can jam good interruptions to fill out the roster. The Zoo engine is primarily for Zeus, which rounds out the going second plays, but being able to fill the GY with Beast-adjacent monsters for Tri effects is super clutch, and with Drident and Chakanine you'll often actually just use this engine to make Ferrijit while filling the GY. It does increase consistency quite a lot while improving your going second hands in general. The deck is the best deck in the format in my opinion, and it isn't even close - there are no extremely bad matchups, provided your interruptions are clutch, and even if you misplay bad the deck often has the pure power to push through for game anyways. You have to watch out for Trap based strategies when you're going second, and you have to really worry about strategies that can gain an enormous amount of advantage throughout a turn, like Prank-Kids for example, but the deck feels almost unstoppable going first, and pretty damn good going second.  Master Duel is a BO1 format, and that impacted the card choices. It is also a Maxx ""C"" format, which kind of makes a bunch of ulties basically mandatory. I feel like that actually serves this deck well, as Evenly is not commonly maindecked, not nearly as often as Harpies or Lightning Storm, which both can be obnoxious but are a far cry from a perfect answer. Evenly also isn't a perfect answer in and of itself. Hand traps are also kind of lower impact - Gamma doesn't mean much, Ash usually means less, and while Maxx ""C"" can be backbreaking the deck can make some plays without giving up too many free cards, which helps, depending on the matchup.  So, card choices.  3 Fire Formation - Tenki. This card is freaking nuts. So, with 3 of these and 3 Fraktall, +1 Rescue Cat we have 7 1 card starters for our Tri plays. But also, these double as more copies of our 4 Zoo monsters. I think they should probably limit this card, Tri is already pretty powerful without it, and this is the card that low-key pushes the Zoo builds way over the top. Rescue Cat is a better combo than just Fraktall, but in terms of mitigating the risks of interaction, I'd always rather see a Tenki or a Fraktall.  4 Zoo Monsters - 2 Thoroughblade, 1 Whiptail, 1 Ramram. The theory behind this is pretty simple - if I have to see 2 Zoo monsters, I'd almost always like to see Thoroughblade first, to mully while setting things up for a Chakanine. This is genuinely the maindeck zoo effect you will use most often. However, Ramram's Trap protection effect is clutch, if niche, and probably the best of the Zoos for when you're ending on Drident turn 1 just for its defense points. Whiptail makes the Zoo pile have another removal option built-in, but in reality I've used the ""attach as material"" effect more often than that. You could make a case that it should be 3 Thoroughblade or 3 Whiptail or 3 Ramram first IMO, depending on the meta. I think Thoroughblade is the best of them, but I like the utility of searching out the Zoos that are relevant.  3 each of each Tri (and a Kitty) - I've already talked a little bit about how Fraktall + Tenki + Cat gives 7 starters, but I really do feel like you have to max out on your  Tri monsters. With Almiraj pretty much any 2 Tris end up being full combo, so having high numbers of all of them are good. Also, you're sending lots of Tris to the GY, and banishing cards from the deck with Pot of Desires, so I do genuinely go through ALL of my tri names in a single game, sometimes.  3 Revolt - The best card in the deck. It is searchable off of Bearbrumm, and that's nice, but you'd almost always rather open it than search it, since Bearbrumm has some tough restrictions and also puts a card back into the deck. This is basically a Dinomiscus, except it generally adds 1 or more cards to your hand while setting up your GY instead of discarding a card. Nutty. Also, you can fire it off in response to Spell/Trap removal, to gain all that advantage and get ahead on the board. This card is wild.  2 Pot of Desires. You could maybe argue that I should be running 3, but tbh I've always found that even in decks where the first Desires is fairly ""free"", the second is usually not, and the third is dead. Yeah, you kind of want to open it more, but not at the cost of interaction or actual combo cards - the best part about the card is still that it is Ash bait. Still, this is a deck where Desires #1 is basically completely free almost all of the time, and where the second is often still pretty damn good, especially if you sequence your searches correctly. This is one of those silly cards, where on the one hand maybe they should limit it like in the TCG, but on the other hand you might actually be doing decks that run it a favour by limiting it. I like 2.  So, it's a Maxx ""C"" format, so we're on 3 Maxx ""C"" plus 3 Ash, plus 2 Called By for hand traps. Maxing out on the ""C"" seems obligatory - sometimes the card is a little bad or kind of dead, but it is game-winning when it resolves most of the time. The rhetoric for these numbers is simple - with 5 ways to answer Maxx ""C"" I am more likely to answer the Maxx ""C"" than they are to draw it, and by relying on Ash and Called By, these are really solid interruptions even if my opponent isn't on the insect. Meanwhile, I like free wins. Sometimes I draw 0 cards and the card still feels good. 3 Imperm fill out the hand trap suite, because Imperm is a hand trap that doesn't die to Called that is good for pushing through on your opponent's turn or your own, can't be negated by things that answer monsters effects, and is great as a generic Trap card to boot. If you're encountering more Maxx ""C"" than I am you could consider Crossout, but Crossout does require deckbuilding to be more centralized than it seems to be just on the ranked ladder - I'd be more inclined to play it in Tri in a competitive Master Duel event, but for laddering, it seems really hit-or-miss.  Lastly, we have a few tech options. I actually like Cosmic main a lot of the time even in BO3, but some kind of Spell/Trap disruption seems completely essential in BO1, and I think Cosmic is the best of the bunch. Solemn Judgment is kind of a pet card of mine, while Strike ends chains better, Judgment is just a good all-around answer that hits back-breaking Spells/Traps, while also answering most things that would hit the field in general. It feels really good here, since we're Apollousa spam and slightly weak to Lightning Storm, Harpies. I've used this on Twin-Twisters, I've used this on Harpie's Duster, I've used this on Boss Monsters, I've even used it on occasion just to kill Rotas in the absence of Ash. Very flexible card.  I think the Extra deck is pretty much completely optimized. You'd like 2 Bearbrumm or 2 Ferrijit or 3 Shuraig, but in reality, Accesscode Talker, Double Dragon Lords, and Almiraj are going to give you more ultility in the first 2 cases, and more consistency in the third case."

Prisma can act as a replacement for a Crimson Nova. This works in tandem with cards like Cubic Dharma, where you could discard Cubic Karma, bring the Crimson Nova that Prisma threw away back into your hand, and then banish the discarded Cubic Karma for the third (second technically, but Prisma changes its name) Crimson Nova. Then just use any poly card you have. Greater Poly is the best IMO because of the Piercing Defense, but the first effect if making it unable to be destroyed by card effects is largely useless because Crimson Nova Trinity already can't be destroyed OR targetted by effects. Super Poly is there just for shits and giggles to potentially make Starving Venom or any other Fusion you could throw in there. Fusion Conscription is there to search for Crimson Nova. Emergency Call can search for Prisma. Summoner Monk can summon Duza at the cost of a spell (you want to discard Cubic spells, especially Karma, since they have secondary GY effects). Duza can then throw ANOTHER Cubic card to the GY, which you would want to be another Karma (or any other Cubic spell/trap you want if you already have what you need to summon Crimson Nova Trinity).  Most of the Extra Deck (specifically Fusionist and Sanwitch) are there as fodder for Pot of Extravagance. Starving Venom can potentially be made, Tapir is for stalling, Zeus is there if (for some reason) you attack with Tapir, Linkuriboh is there for more stalling, Pentestag for piercing, and Verte in case you don't draw any Poly cards.  Crimson Nova Trinity is definitely the best card in the deck, and you should be going for it, but you don't necessarily NEED it to win. Crimson Nova on its own is already an amazing card and can dish out OTK's easily. Vijam can stall insanely well, and Cubic Causality can make stalling even easier, with both cards essentially making your opponents' monsters useless by putting Cubic Counters on them. That means no attacking, no effects, just sitting there doing nothing."

Side deck will need more attention, and extra deck is the best it can be, until more cards get release. The reason it is 42 and not 40 is because of Orochi. Having a 40 card build is very small when he's in the deck, also I will be adding a Drytron summon/effect list. By the Gizmeks having 50 in their attack it can be very hard calculating, however here are two to start with: Crystron + Deskbot = Drytron effect. Another one is Makami + Arakami = Drytron effect and summon. I did not add Pot Of Desires because I do not like the card, plus with Orochi your deck thins out very quickly! That's why Small World is a great addition to the deck! That card plus Naganaki make very good resources! Also with Naganaki and PSY-Framelord Omega; facedown banish cards does not effect you as much, so replacing Infinite Impermanence with Evenly Match would not be a bad idea. Another thing to keep in mind is that the babies (Inaba, Naganaki, Taniguku, and Arakami) banish face up. That is why Burial from a different Dimension is in the deck. Pot Of Acquisitiveness was in the deck, until I realize it is best to have your cards either in your hand, field, grave, or banish. In the deck is fine, but not as fine when you need a combo, or card. Also, Burial can target your opponents banish, so if your playing against a deck that use banish cards, or a card that targets banished cards you can chain it with Burial. Also Burial is up to 3 monsters while POA (Pot Of Acquisitiveness) is 3 monsters, so keep that in mind. The board I try to land on is Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, Hearld of Arc Light, and F.A Dawn Dragster. It is not the best broad, but it is the best we got, until Konami give us more support, or better generic extra deck monsters. All in all, it is very bittersweet when playing this deck. Every Gizmek has two effects and one of those effects are great! while the other one is not so much! Like the card Gizmek Inaba for example, seems like this card is suppose to be your starter, yet Konami made it have a ""when this card is normal summon"" instead of ""If this card is special summon or normal summon"" or ""If this card is normal summon"". I have yet to miss timing with Inaba, but one day it will happen! And when it does I might explode! Also, why special summon in defense!? If you're going to make me normal summon why can't I control how the other monster will be summon!? Another thing is that you can not combo with it with Naganaki. That would have made this deck VERY good! but a man can dream! you can combo Inaba with Yata. It is a weird combo, but it is one. Also, Inaba first effect is not once per turn, so keep that in mind. The second effect of Inaba hardly comes up because it uses the monsters ""original attack"" would have been better if it just said monsters attack, but a man can only dream. I gave up playing SowrdSouls for this because I wanted a deck of my own to play in meta. I never liked machine monsters, but Gizmeks name and look always got to me. Although, I spent a year putting in time, and money to make my dream of winning a YCS with a deck hardly no one plays, I am uploading this deck profile just in case I can not do it. My dream is not about me winning the YCS with a deck hardly no one plays, but for anyone can win a YCS with a deck hardly no one plays. I know! Better said than done, but hey! A man can dream!"

Chaos Dragons has always been my favorite deck since I started playing when Dragon's Collide structure deck came out. I've been looking around for some viable options of builds for Chaos Dragons but haven't really found anything that has interested me until now.  I found this awesome video that I was very happy to see someone putting together a newer, more modern version of Chaos Dragons called Chaos Dragon Lightsworns. I've done it up a bit and have summitted an example of what I could play and played around with some good cards that could go well with deck.  Let me know if ya'll have any suggestions of how I could make it a little better. I really want to help revive Chaos Dragons.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7Ka5wCclFI"

Anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>“Why play this deck?”</strong></span>  <span>Well… if it still wasn’t obvious enough in most of the lists that I’ve posted, I love Fusion Summoning, and this deck features two decks that do both, being Despia and Shaddolls, and Dogmatika is always a great engine to be splashed with any Fusion strategy that needs LIGHT targets such as the two previously mentioned and of course, Invoked, but unlike the latter, this actually has a better draw power and can play a lot better around and through Ash Blossom. I’ll discuss the other intricacies further in the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The Despia (<a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a>, <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a>)</strong> – <span>Your substitute to the Invoked engine. Does it play around Ash? Yes, and arguably better than Invoked. Is it better? Debatable. Here are their effects.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber </a>– <span>The successor to the best Normal Summon in the game, Aleister the Invoker. Allows you to search any “Branded” Spell/Trap from your Deck, much like his aforementioned precursor, and has a semi-relevant effect that Special Summons himself from the GY when a face-up Fusion Monster you control is either destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent’s card effect, to target and negate the effects of an opponent’s monster until the end of the turn. Not the best negation effect, but it’s better than nothing.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a> – <span>The semi-brick of the deck, since you don’t really mind drawing him though you’d still much rather search for him. Has an effect that Special Summons himself from the GY or when banished after getting used as Fusion Material while he’s in either your hand or field. Also has an effect that negates the effects of any targeted monster when a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monster is Special Summoned, which comes up occasionally.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Tragedy</a> – <span>Your main searcher. Mandatory 3 of in any list that runs Despia cards, don’t believe anyone who tells you otherwise. There’s literally no reason not to run 3 of these. Upon getting sent to the GY or banished by a card effect, it searches you any “Despia” monster, which makes your Allure of Darkness essentially a +1 in card advantage. It also allows you to recycle your “Branded” Spells/Traps from your GY by banishing itself, although you can only use either one or its other effect once per turn.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>• The Dogmatika (<a data-name=""Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Ecclesia</a>, <a data-name=""Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"">Fleurdelis</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Dogmatika Maximus"">Maximus</a>)</strong> – <span>Standard monster ratios for the Dogmatika engine. We’d have to run 3 Ecclesias since she also acts as a LIGHT Attribute Fusion Material, and because Nadir Servant is still at 1 for some reason. Just hover over their names to see their effects.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Shaddolls (<a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Beast</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Dragon</a>, <a data-name=""Nehshaddoll Genius"">Genius</a>, <a data-name=""Naelshaddoll Ariel"">Ariel</a>, <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Hedgehog</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Shaddoll Falco"">Falco</a>)</strong> - <span>Much like the Invoked variant, you only really want to run 1 of each of these, but run just enough so that you still have a pretty decent chance of drawing one of them if you need them. They all have pretty simple effects, so just hover over their names to see what they do.</span></span>  <span>Hand traps could literally be anything. <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash </a>is just generally good, <a data-name=""Effect Veiler"">Veiler</a> is also great for being a LIGHT target so is either <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru </a>or <a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Lancea</a> (which is also great for being a Fairy). It's really up to you.</span>  <span><strong>The Spells</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a></strong> - <span>Your main draw power. As I have stated before, is a +1 when combined with Despian Tragedy.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Nadir Servant"">Nadir Servant</a></strong> - <span>A lone copy of this is still worth playing, since we're still playing Psy-Framelord Omega.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shaddoll Fusion"">Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>One of the most revolutionary Fusion Spells in the game. A generally good splashable Fusion spell that people love crying about since it uses Fusion Materials from the Deck.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a></strong> - <span>Utility 1 of and GY setup. Also instantly triggers the effects of all your Shaddoll monsters and Despian Tragedy.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Fusion"">El Shaddoll Fusion</a></strong> - <span>Makes pushing for game easier, dodges both Ash and Droll during the Draw Phase.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a></strong> - <span>Hand trap protection.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a></strong> - <span>Your main searcher spell, and primary way of summoning Aluber. It discards as a part of its effect, so it also triggers your Shaddoll monsters, allowing you to chain block the Aluber you've summoned. Also provides your Fusion monsters a protection from destruction effects as a substitute by banishing itself from the GY.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a></strong> - <span>Great removal spell, great combat trick, easily abusable by this deck due to it only caring about two attributes, which so happen to also be the most popular and ubiquitous ones in the game being LIGHT and DARK, only at a cost of discarding. This card has no reason to be at 2, but it's better than being at 1 or nothing.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a></strong> - <span>Your main search target for Aluber. It's a Field Spell that's also a Fusion Spell. It also allows you to Special Summon any Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster from your GY when a non-Fusion Fairy monster is destroyed by battle or was removed from the field by an opponent's card effect.</span></span>  <span><strong>The (only two) Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Resh Shaddoll Incarnation"">Resh Shaddoll Incarnation</a></strong> - <span>One of your revival spells. Allows you to negate multiple times with Apkallone, to revive Winda from the GY after getting outed, or to help you with the grind game by looping your Ariel and Falco. If you want added security for the grind, I suggest adding <a data-name=""Shaddoll Hound"">Hound</a> to loop this easier.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Shaddoll Schism"">Shaddoll Schism</a></strong> - <span>The bane of every Special Summon that starts a chain, for its most popular application of allowing you to summon Winda during your opponent's turn, but is also a non-targeting, non-destruction removal, provided that you're summoning a ""Shaddoll"" Fusion Monster that shares an attribute with an opponent's monster.</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span>Note: I've made this semi-budget, because I'm still saving gems for the Darklord cards and more staples necessary for that build which I may or may not be sharing soon. I'll see.</span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a></strong> - <span>A non-Despia Fusion Monster that is actually one of your best boss monsters. Provides all your Fairy monsters protection from targeting, which includes El Shaddoll Construct. Also allows you to Special Summon a Fairy monster from either your hand or GY during the Main Phase at a cost of 1000 LP, which includes El Shaddoll Construct.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Despian Fusions (<a data-name=""Despian Proskenion"">Proskenion</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Quaeritis</a>)</strong> - <span>Proskenion is a Despia Fusion Monster that requires 3 Fusion Materials, including a LIGHT, a DARK, and a ""Despia"" monster. Allows you to either banish or steal an opponent's Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link monster from their GY (and it does not negate their effects). It also burns your opponent equal to a monster's original ATK or DEF when it destroys it by battle (whichever was higher). Quaeritis on the other hand only requires a ""Despia"" monster and either a LIGHT or a DARK monster. It also has an effect that allows you to modulate the ATK values of all monsters currently on the field to 0, except for Level 8 or higher Fusion monsters, which essentially makes your opponent's Apollousa useless.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Shaddoll Fusions (<a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct"">Construct</a>, <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Apkallone"">Apkallone</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">Winda</a>)</strong> - <span>Construct, the once banned darling of Shaddolls, notorious for resource looping due to its non-once per turn effects and for its non-targeting combat removal. Apkallone, the newest addition to the family and is a very much welcome one, offers you a PERMANENT targeting negation, which not a lot of players are aware of, and an effect that lets you loop ""Shaddoll"" cards in your GY or search them from the Deck. Winda, the most infamous of all of them, she's the resident floodgate that a lot of players love crying about. Two of her is the minimum, even as just a splash for the Dogmatika engine.</span></span>  <span><strong>• The Super Poly targets (<a data-name=""Starving Venom Fusion Dragon"">Starving Venom Fusion Dragon</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Mudragon of the Swamp"">Mudragon of the Swamp</a>)</strong> - <span>Two of the best generic Super Poly targets, one being against the most common Attribute in the game, which is DARK, and the other for the weirder ones, mainly WIND, especially now that <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a> is already in the game.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Psy-Framelord Omega"">Psy-Framelord Omega</a></strong> - <span>Essential for murdering your opponent's Extra Deck with the Dogmatika engine.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Condemned Darklord"">Condemned Darklord</a></strong> - <span>A generic Link 2 for your Fairies. You could play <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a> instead, it's fine.</span></span>  <span><strong>• <a data-name=""Gravity Controller"">Gravity Controller</a></strong> - <span>A way to out problematic monsters in the EMZ. Also a DARK target for Winda, and is a part of the Construct resource loop.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></span>  <span>Despia is just one of those decks that were initially weak on release, and was even ridiculed by some players for how ""underwhelming"" they were, compared to Swordsoul and Flundereeze at that time, until recently that they've received a wave of fantastic support, including an archetypal Shaddoll Fusion. I for one am happy about it, but of course, I know that a lot of people weren't, especially in a format where Verte Anaconda is legal, which gave them trauma from Fusion Spells that use materials from the deck, which is arguably the least of their problems, in a format where Artifact Scythe is legal. Regardless, expect this archetype to only get better over time, and don't listen to people who only trash archetypes because of how bad they were at first, especially if it's a Fusion strategy. There's really not much else to say about this deck that I haven't said already, instead as per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

The combos are pretty much the same: You activate ""Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda"", discard 1 Springans monster, summon ""Springans Merrymaker"", then, based on what you discarded and/or what you milled with Merrymaker, you can choose what to do.  The problem with the old version of the deck was the Great Sand Sea, because, without it in your starting hand or a way to search it, it was a 100% brick, but, thanks to ""Springans Kitt"" and ""Branded in High Spirit"", you can do an xyz summon with just one card. The only problem with this new deck are the handtraps. Cards like Ash Blossom, Artifact Lancea, Ghost Belle, Etc... literally kill this deck, so, cards like Called by the grave and Crossout can literally save your games.  This is just a for fun deck, and pretty budget too (Expect for F0 Utopic Draco that you can change with a lot of rank 4/8 xyz monsters), so, if you are a new player and/or you like Xyz monster, this deck is, in my opinion, perfect.

Now, activate Diviner of the Herald's effect to special summon 1 Level 2 or lower Fairy monster from your hand or Deck. Summon Crystron Halqifibrax and go on from there.

Use Poly or Fluffal Owl to fusion summon Frightfur Tiger, using your Edge Imp and at least 1 Fluffal. Use it's ability to clear your opponent's monsters and anything else that would stop it from attacking directly.  Use Frightfur Fusion to summon Frightfur Wolf using Edge Imp Sabres and 2 Fluffals as material. Wolf can attack 3 times, and gets a boost thanks to Tiger. Attack for game with both Frightfurs.  Fluffal Dog is in the deck to search Owl and Keeper of Dragon Magic gets you Poly. A bunch of negates stops your opponent from getting their ideal end board and of course the other fluffals are for fusion material.  Have fun!"

We are playing Despia with a small splash of Aleister because we didn't get all the Despia cards we wanted from this patch sadly. But we got our main boys and Fallen of Albaz which is insane. This deck is running 5 super polys essentially, fallen of albaz's effect is like super poly minus the ""Neither Player Can activate cards or effects in response."" it's still insane. First of all this is a turn 2 deck, if we go turn one we hope to open invoker as we really don't have many turn 1 strats besides opening the field with a super poly face down and <a data-name=""invoked mechaba"">invoked mechaba</a> to protect the backrow. This deck has 1 shot capabilities with <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> being able to come back after being used as materials with a whooping 3k attack but overall the reason I love this deck is how versatile it is with all our swiss army knife options in the Extra Deck. Since Master Duel is a best of one format having a plethora of extra deck options for every occasion helps in alot of ways. We run Artemis for Aleistar as we do not have many light monsters in the deck so this gives us a cheap easy way to get into Invoked Mechaba. Main boss monsters you want to get into are Despian Quaeritis and Despian Proskenion as they are very annoying to deal with for the Opponent. This deck still could use some ironing out as there are alot of cards I want to test this deck out with but Honestly it's been doing really well against meta decks so I wanted to share it."

Failing that, setting up a Guardian Chimera play with Branded in Red during your opponent's turn is a good fallback strategy as well. Remember that Ad Libitum can bring back any of your Despia or lvl 8 or higher fusion monster from the grave or banished in a pinch, so don't be afraid to use some of your boss monsters as fusion material in those situations.  Something else to stay aware of is the negation effect of Dragostapelia, making affected monsters lvl 1. This can be important for the Quick Effect of Quaeritis. Summoning Masquerade for decks that need to activate a lot of effects to set upa board can be and be a recipe for an easy win, especially for decks using the same Adventure engine. Like with any other deck, thinking through your plays beforehand and staying aware of as much as possible (field, GY, banished, deck, once-per-turns, etc.) for both you and your opponent is paramount to success. Keeping plays simple and making optimal choices will see you through to the end. Have fun and enjoy."

Drytron + Stein,"&nbsp;    After many months I was finally able to craft my Drytron-Stein deck with which I had been playing for several months on Nexus.  There are two ways to play:  &nbsp;  1 - The first way is by using lirilusc and the effects of Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom and Wind Witch - Crystal Bell. Causing 8000 damage on the first turn and thus victory.  2 - The second way is using Exterio , Apollousa and The Last Warrior from another planet , we can negate invocations and effects leaving the enemy in a difficult situation.  It's pretty simple. hope you like."

If the Tuner is <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion make sure you link chain Halqifibrax at 1 and O-Lion at 2 to protect against Ash. </a></li>  	<li>Jet Synchron into Salamangreat Almiraj then use jet Synchron to get into Crystron. (this will alter how your turns are played throughout the game though. Which is why I think adding Deskbot 001 and removing 1 O-Lion might be the move)</li>  	<li>any level 7 or lower monster summoned into <a data-name=""Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson</a></li>  	<li>Any monster with Tenyi Spirit - Adhara special summon</li>  	<li>Tenyi Spirit Vishuda or Ashuna special summon, Link into Monk of the Tenyi, then Special summon Adhara.</li>  	<li>Last but not least the most Obscure way would be summoning any tuner monster and having your opponent <a data-name=""effect veiler"">effect veiler</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> it then using <a data-name=""The Iris Swordsoul"">The Iris Swordsoul</a>'s effect to special summon it to the field.</li> </ol> 1st Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax , This will allow you to search out </a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> which is you're main tuner to enable the combo. (</a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> can be replaced with </a><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> if you wish) </a>  2nd Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, This will allow you to get 3 lv 3 tokens which will be important. </a>  3rd Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing , Use Auroradon's ability to sac 2 tokens(if you have a monk of tenyi on the field if not you want to sacrifice Auroradon and a token) to summon </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion. You then will synchro summon into </a><a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing which doing so two triggers happen, stack Denglongs trigger first and follow it with </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion's effect to protect against Ash. You want to grab </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> with Denglong's effect. Then you want to use Denglong's activated effect to send a level 7 tenyi to the grave, if you do not have </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> in the graveyard send her. This will make Denglong into a level 7 tuner. </a>  4th Objective of this deck is to make Baronne De fleur, Synchro summon using the level 7 <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing and 1 level 3 token to make De fleur. Denglong's effect will activate when sent to the graveyard which in most cases you should grab Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing and set in defense position. </a>  5th Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi , Remember sending Ashuna to the graveyard? This is why, we need to activate jet synchrons effect to summon him back to the field first because if you activate ashuna first she will stop you from special summoning anything that isn't a Tenyi Monster. Then Remember why we sacrificed the link 3 instead of the token? because we need the token to activate ashuna. So now you activate Ashuna from the grave to special summon </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi""> from the deck. Use Vishuda and jet synchron to make </a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>  Now unless your opponent has a ton of board breakers they now have to face against 2  Omni Negates and 1 Semi Monster Negate. This deck produces another Omni Negate if you open with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> or <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> as you send <a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing to the Graveyard. Doing this means when you use </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing on your opponents card and destroy </a><a data-name=""Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing"">Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing, when you special summon </a><a data-name=""Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing"">Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing you can also bring back </a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing""> from the graveyard and with Bi'an's effect synchro summon on your opponents turn into </a><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light.</a>  &nbsp;  As you can see the deck if very good and I urge everyone who is sick of being a Meta Slave to give the deck a try!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

If the Tuner is <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion make sure you link chain Halqifibrax at 1 and O-Lion at 2 to protect against Ash. </a></li>  	<li>Jet Synchron into Salamangreat Almiraj then use jet Synchron to get into Crystron. (this will alter how your turns are played throughout the game though. Which is why I think adding Deskbot 001 and removing 1 O-Lion might be the move)</li>  	<li>any level 7 or lower monster summoned into <a data-name=""Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson"">Destrudo the lost Dragon's Frisson</a></li>  	<li>Any monster with Tenyi Spirit - Adhara special summon</li>  	<li>Tenyi Spirit Vishuda or Ashuna special summon, Link into Monk of the Tenyi, then Special summon Adhara.</li>  	<li>Last but not least the most Obscure way would be summoning any tuner monster and having your opponent <a data-name=""effect veiler"">effect veiler</a> or <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> it then using <a data-name=""The Iris Swordsoul"">The Iris Swordsoul</a>'s effect to special summon it to the field.</li> </ol> 1st Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax , This will allow you to search out </a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> which is you're main tuner to enable the combo. (</a><a data-name=""Jet Synchron"">Jet Synchron</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> can be replaced with </a><a data-name=""Deskbot 001"">Deskbot 001</a><a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax""> if you wish) </a>  2nd Objective of this deck is to Link summon into <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon"">Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon, This will allow you to get 3 lv 3 tokens which will be important. </a>  3rd Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing , Use Auroradon's ability to sac 2 tokens(if you have a monk of tenyi on the field if not you want to sacrifice Auroradon and a token) to summon </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion. You then will synchro summon into </a><a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing which doing so two triggers happen, stack Denglongs trigger first and follow it with </a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion"">Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion's effect to protect against Ash. You want to grab </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> with Denglong's effect. Then you want to use Denglong's activated effect to send a level 7 tenyi to the grave, if you do not have </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a><a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast O-Lion""> in the graveyard send her. This will make Denglong into a level 7 tuner. </a>  4th Objective of this deck is to make Baronne De fleur, Synchro summon using the level 7 <a data-name=""Denglong, First of the Yang Zing"">Denglong, First of the Yang Zing and 1 level 3 token to make De fleur. Denglong's effect will activate when sent to the graveyard which in most cases you should grab Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing and set in defense position. </a>  5th Objective of this deck is to make <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi , Remember sending Ashuna to the graveyard? This is why, we need to activate jet synchrons effect to summon him back to the field first because if you activate ashuna first she will stop you from special summoning anything that isn't a Tenyi Monster. Then Remember why we sacrificed the link 3 instead of the token? because we need the token to activate ashuna. So now you activate Ashuna from the grave to special summon </a><a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda"">Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda</a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi""> from the deck. Use Vishuda and jet synchron to make </a><a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>  Now unless your opponent has a ton of board breakers they now have to face against 2  Omni Negates and 1 Semi Monster Negate. This deck produces another Omni Negate if you open with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> or <a data-name=""Vessel for the Dragon Cycle"">Vessel for the Dragon Cycle</a> as you send <a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing to the Graveyard. Doing this means when you use </a><a data-name=""Nine Pillars of Yang Zing"">Nine Pillars of Yang Zing on your opponents card and destroy </a><a data-name=""Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing"">Jiaotu, Darkness of the Yang Zing, when you special summon </a><a data-name=""Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing"">Bi'An, Earth of the Yang Zing you can also bring back </a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing"">Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing</a><a data-name=""Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing""> from the graveyard and with Bi'an's effect synchro summon on your opponents turn into </a><a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light.</a>  &nbsp;  As you can see the deck if very good and I urge everyone who is sick of being a Meta Slave to give the deck a try!"

[April 2022],"<span><strong>Overview</strong></span>  While Darklords were good before, they just got even better with the addition of Despias. We didn't get <em>every</em> piece of support for Despias, so this decklist will be subject to change for the future whenever it gets added. Why combine Darklords and Despias together? They complement each other! Aside from most of everything being Dark-Fairy monsters, Despia's fix the consistency issue that Darklords have, and Darklords in turn help swarm the field and carry out OTKs with their high attack points. In addition to that, the main tech card I use is <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> . This card is a floodgate; it locks everyone out of special summoning- and more often than not will be an auto win if you can get it out whilst going first.  <strong><span>Pros and Cons</span></strong> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li> <ul>  	<li></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>  	<li><span>Consistency </span></li>  	<li><span>High search and draw power</span></li>  	<li><span>High potential to OTK</span></li>  	<li><span>Ability to lock the board down</span></li> </ul> ------------------------------------------------ <ul>  	<li><span>Weak to effects that banish cards</span></li>  	<li><span>Very little spell/trap removal and negation</span></li>  	<li><span>Difficult to recover if your board gets broken</span></li> </ul> <strong><span>How Consistent?</span></strong>  Your opening hand is very important since this deck has a tough time recovering later on if needed. Out of 100 opening hands (assuming going first with 5 starting cards) these were the results:  Good Hands: <strong><span>65/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>65%</span></strong>)  -- hand has multiple draws and searches that could allow playing through handtraps and other negates.  Okay Hands: <strong><span>26/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>26%</span></strong>) -- hand has a tech card or handtrap(s), but still has potential to search and draw.  Bad Hands: <strong><span>6/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>6%</span></strong>) -- hand has very little or risky options (ie. allure of darkness and no dark monsters).  Dead Hands: <strong><span>3/100</span></strong> (<strong><span>3%</span></strong>) -- can't do anything, forced to end turn.  Overall, pretty consistent with only around a 10% of not having at least a decent hand. In general this deck performs better going first compared to second, but can function fine going second if needed.  <span><strong>Key Cards and Combos</strong></span>  <a data-name=""Darklord Morningstar"">Darklord Morningstar</a> - Functions as both an extender and card destruction if used as fusion material for <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> . Can combo with <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> where it can swarm Darklords to your field depending on the number of effect monsters on your opponent's field. Can also be used as an <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> target if there are no better options.  <a data-name=""Darklord Ixchel"">Darklord Ixchel</a> - One of the best Darklords in the deck. She does 3 things: draw from the deck, set up the grave, and can copy Darklord spell/traps from the graveyard. Depending on which spells/traps are in the grave, she can effectively be an extra searcher/extender/negation.  <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge of Despia</a> - Summons itself to the field when used for fusion material and is a negate to anything summoned from the extra deck. Can be very useful for going into Rank 8 xyz monsters.  <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> - The best extender in the deck since its revival effect isn't once per turn. You do need to be careful not to miss the timing on the revival effect- quick effect copying a <a data-name=""Darklord Contact"">Darklord Contact</a> from the graveyard will cause you to miss timing as well as using <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> 's revival effect during a chain. To avoid this, use your revival effects from the hand and not during a chain. Superbia can also revive <strong>any</strong> fairy monster from the graveyard, including <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> for synchro plays.  <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> - Your main floodgate of the deck; prevents both players from special summoning. More often than not- if you can manage to get Kristya on the field turn one while going first, it's an auto-win. If you're going second- you can also use Kristya as fusion material from the hand for your Despia fusions.  <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a> - Your best searcher in the deck to search for your Despia spells and also has a graveyard effect.  <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> - Bit of a double edged sword since she gives your opponent a monster, but also functions as a decent searcher for Ixchel, Superbia, or Morningstar. Ideally would want to give your opponent <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> , <a data-name=""Darklord Nergal"">Darklord Nergal</a>, or one of your Superbias. I don't currently run this in my deck, but she also combos pretty well with <a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> . Keep in mind you are locked into only Fairy effects for the rest of the turn after using her effect.  <a data-name=""Darklord Nergal"">Darklord Nergal</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Capricious Darklord"">Capricious Darklord</a> - Nergal has the same copying effect as Ixchel and also gives you piercing damage while Capricious powers down your opponent's monsters when it gets sent to the graveyard. These are tech cards that can be substituted if needed. Bit situational, but I have won duels by beating over 0 ATK/DEF monsters.  <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> - The only handtrap I currently run in this deck, it can protect your searchers from other handtraps and set up the grave. It's also a Light monster that can be used for Despia fusions. It also combos <strong>extremely</strong> well with <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> and <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> .  <a data-name=""Despian Tragedy"">Despian Tragedy</a> - Your best target for <a data-name=""Allure of Darkness"">Allure of Darkness</a> since it turns the card into a +1 for your hand. It can also recycle your Despia spells back to your hand if your field spell gets destroyed.  <a data-name=""The Sanctified Darklord"">The Sanctified Darklord</a> - The only trap I run in this deck; it adds a bit more control and LP recovery. You can also use this trap on your own <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> so that you can special summon monsters during your own turn. This can also be substituted for any other Darklord trap of your choosing. <a data-name=""Darklord Rebellion"">Darklord Rebellion</a> is a good alternative if you want more spell/trap removal.  <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> - Your main beater and extender. Being able to summon him became insanely easy because of <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> . He can potentially board wipe your opponent if you use Morningstar as material, else he makes an excellent extender being able to summon <strong>any</strong> fairy monster from the hand or graveyard. A good way to surprise your opponent is to quick effect summon <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a> during their turn.  <a data-name=""Despian Quaeritis"">Despian Quaeritis</a> - Reduces the ATK of any monster that isn't a level 8+ fusion monster down to 0. You can combo this effect with Numeron Dragon for an OTK if you aren't locked into only fusions for the turn. This effect can also combo with Apollousa where her ATK will reset to her original value even after having lost ATK from negating.  <a data-name=""Baronne de Fleur"">Baronne de Fleur</a> - A very powerful synchro monster as long as you aren't locked into fusions or fairy abilities for the turn. Ideally you want to summon her with <a data-name=""Darklord Superbia"">Darklord Superbia</a> and <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> . During your standby phase you can have her recycle Superbia from the grave- and it will in turn revive Orange Light from the grave as well and you'll be ready to summon her again. You can effectively loop this into summoning her during your turn for a free card pop and omni negate.  <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> - As long as you aren't locked into only Fairy effects for the turn, this card can help facilitate you summoning <a data-name=""Archlord Kristya"">Archlord Kristya</a>. The draw 4 is too good to pass up since there isn't an easy way to search Kristya.  <strong><span>Other Options</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>If you aren't keen on using <a data-name=""Herald of Orange Light"">Herald of Orange Light</a> , <a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> is a good alternative since it's also a light monster (and a tuner).</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a> can combo with <a data-name=""Indulged Darklord"">Indulged Darklord</a> and is a great going second card.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> is another good hand trap to consider if you have the room for it. Keep in mind- the more handtraps you run, the more often you will brick; this type of deck relies on having plenty of resources.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> can be added to make up for the lack of spell/trap removal.</li>  	<li><a data-name=""Artifact Lancea"">Artifact Lancea</a> can help prevent your cards from getting banished. Despias usually don't mind being banished, but Darklords can't do anything while banished.</li> </ul>"

Crimson is the best one here in my opinion, being able to almost singlehandedly summon Red Supernova Dragon on the first turn (if you don't get interrupted, of course). Red allows you to summon a 4* to pair to go into Red Rising. Synkron and Creation can special summon themselves. Chain can be used as intended if you want, but I use it as Light-attribute banish fodder for Chaos Ruler. You can replace it with basically any other Light monsters, even a Kaiju if you wanted to just have that at hand. Wildwind can special summon itself when a Resonator is on the field.</span></li>  	<li><span>Assault Mode - The Assault Mode engine allows for some really quick and easy synchros, and works even better alongside Resonators. All the cards are pretty self-explanatory. Psi-Reflector can search and special summon Assault Mode monsters from the GY and manipulate their levels to go into the exact synchro you want. It's a lot more consistent than relying solely on Resonators, which can occasionally brick. Emergency Teleport is to get out a Psi-Reflector when you don't have it in hand.</span></li>  	<li><span>Other Main Deck Monsters - Iron Dragon Tiamaton is there as a level 4 that special summons itself. It also has a niche but cool column destruction effect whenever it's summoned. You can replace this with something like Witch of the Black Forest (searches after going from Field to GY) or Skull Meister (level 4 GY-negate handtrap). I don't find those necessary as I feel the deck has enough searches, and Called By is just a better Skull Meister. If you want you can throw in a Kaiju, I would recommend Radian (level 7 Dark Fiend) or Thunder King (level 9 Light Thunder). Radian is better because it has low stats but Thunder King can be used as banish fodder for Chaos Ruler. Hydride is there to be summoned by Halqifibrax, I'll explain that later. Of course, I also run 2 Ash and Maxx C. </span></li>  	<li><span>Spells &amp; Traps - Resonator Call is self explanatory, it searches for Resonators. Emergency Teleport is there to get out a Psi-Reflector for the Assault Mode engine.  Burning Soul is so you can Synchro summon on enemy turn if you want to, and it also provides targeting protection for Level ≤8 Synchros. It also fetches a card from the GY to your hand, so if you want to reuse a handtrap or if Chaos Ruler milled something like Assault Mode Activate or a handtrap, you can grab those back. Assault Mode Activate is just there for the Assault Mode engine, you'll never actually be placing it down. Imperm is a generic negate trap. Red Reign is absolutely amazing and self explanatory, it's a monster banish wipe except for the highest level monsters. </span></li> </ul> <ul>  	<li><span>Extra Deck - Samsara is there for coverage in case all you get is something like Synkron/Chain and Wildwind, or if you want to do some funky stuff into Supernova (I've done it a couple times, it's nice to have). Red Rising starts up most of the summon spam combos when not using Assault Mode. Scarlight is the basic Level 8 to go into cards like Abyss, Bane, King Calamity, Nova, or Supernova. Chaos Ruler can excavate the top 5 cards of your deck, take 1 Light or Dark monster, and then send the rest to the GY (which really isn't a bad thing in this deck, as a lot of cards have GY effects). Abyss is a free once-per-turn negate and can summon Resonators when it does damage. Bane can tribute a monster to summon a Red Dragon Archfiend monster from the GY, and can also summon Resonators when it does damage. King Calamity and Red Supernova are the powerhouses of the deck. In terms of how good they are, I think King Calamity &lt; Red Supernova. Red nova is a pretty simple big beatstick, but it can't be destroyed by card effects and can negate an attack by temporarily banishing itself. King Calamity stops your opponent from activating cards the turn it's summoned. When it destroys a monster by battle, it does burn damage equal to that card's attack, which means if that monster was in attack position, you'll always be doing 4000 damage. It also revives a level 8 or lower Dark dragon Synchro when it dies so you won't be left open. Supernova is by far the best card in the deck. Huge beatstick that can banish wipe your opponents' entire field, and bring itself back in your next end phase, and as a cherry on top, it can't be destroyed by card effects. King Calamity has an advantage though, where because of the lockout effect, you can use Burning Soul or Shooting Riser to summon King Calamity during your opponents turn and completely lock them out of everything. You can replace Burning Soul with something like Synchro Call or Synchro Transmission if you want, I just like Burning Soul because it adds a later of protection in case I use it during my turn or if King Calamitys effect somehow gets negated. Halqifibrax is there for the dreaded all-Tuner brick hand. This way, at the very least you'll have a way to get at least 1 solid monster out. Get 2 tuners out, summon Halq, summon Hydride, then during your opponents turn proc Halq to summon Shooting Riser (Do / don't use it's effect, all depends what you want to go into) and use Shooting Riser + Hydride to go into either Baronne (if you didn't use Risers effect) or Chaos Ruler / Scarlight (if you used Risers effect and dumped a level 2). </span></li> </ul> &nbsp; <ul>  	<li><span>Side Deck / Replacement Cards - Most of these are just cards you can use to replace things you either don't have or don't want. Hat Tricker is an easy-to-use card you can just throw in there. Nibiru, Solemn Judgement, Lightning Storm, and Feather Duster are all good and generic cards if you want to switch things around (for example using CBTG instead of Skull Meister). Ancient Pixie and Zeta are both good level 7 Synchros in case you somehow brick with only something like Creation and Wildwind. I don't run these because it's such a small chance of that being your only play that it's negligible. Beelze and Dark End Dragon are both good replacements for Scarlight if you're not planning to run Nova (not a super important card anyway), especially Dark End Dragon. Dark End sends cards to the Gy rather than destroying them, which bypasses cards that ""can't be destroyed"". You can run Tyrant if you want to, I only run 13 cards because of the current D.D. Dynamite deck going around. Nethersoul Dragon is also another good Level 10 if you want one, with a plethora of good effects. Now, if you want to be really annoying, you can technically run the Very Fun Dragon. Abyss works as one of the level 9 materials, and you can either summon a second Abyss or run the Trishula fusion by banishing monsters, no poly needed so you don't need to change main deck cards around. But you'd have to somehow get 2 Abyss' out on one turn, then somehow have both of thems survive until the next turn where you'd XYZ summon. Not worth imo especially because you'd be cutting down the rest of your extra deck.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span>Overall a super good and super fun deck. The previous deck I made got me to Plat, and this one's even better.</span>"
