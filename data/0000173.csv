Das funktioniert mit Cyber Dragon Core + Cyberdark Claw. Diese zwei auf der Starthand ergeben den End Drache. Aber auch nur dann, wenn man keine Handtraps abbekommt. Hier kommen wir auch schon zur größten Schwäche des Decks.</span> <span>Handtraps, die den Combos-Aufbau des Decks stören. Sobald man eine Handtrap kassiert, ist meist Schluss mit dem Zug und der End Drache kommt nicht auf das Feld.</span> <span>Es fehlt dem Deck halt auch mit seiner enormen Seachpower immer noch an Konstanz. Eventuell kommt im laufe der Zeit ja noch Ersatz für Horn, Edge, Keel.</span> <span>Oder sogar ein neues Fusionsmonster. (Gedankenspiele wie ""3xCyberdark Monster"" oder ""1xCyberdark Maschine + 1xCyberdark Drache Monster"") Es könnte ja nur den Simplen Effekt haben, den Cyber End Drache aus dem Extra-Deck an sich auszurüsten. Das würde die Beschwörung des Dark End beschleunigen und wäre auch nicht broken, da Dark End es ebenfalls nicht ist. Naja träumen kann man ja noch....</span>  <span>Searchpower: Cyberdark  Chimera, Cyberdark Cannon, Cyberdark Claw, Cyberdark World, Cybernetic Horizon, Cyber Dragon Core, Cyber Emergency</span>  <span>Useless: Cyberdark Horn, Cyberdark Edge, Cyberdark Keel</span>  <span>-Dragon Buster für Lockdown</span>  <span>-Crossout Designator &amp; Called um den Combo Ablauf zu sichern</span>  <span><span>-Ash Blossom  &amp; Impermanence um den Gegner zu stören und auch als Ziel für Crossout Designator </span><span>(Droll &amp; Lock Bird im Side, da dieser auch dem Deck extrem schadet)</span></span>  <span>-Attachment Cybern + Cyberdark Invasion sind eine schöne Combi um immer wieder Cyberdarkness auf das Feld zu schmeißen und 2-3 Negates zu haben</span>  <span>-Gear Gigant X ist für einen Search und Zeus</span>  <span>-Cyber Dragon Nova gegen Dogmatika Maximus (Mechaba war auch eine Idee, nur der Platz fehlt)</span>  <span>- Feather Duster, Twin Twister, und Lightning Storm sind für die bösen -nicht aktiven Effekte- da. (Mystic Mine, Skill Drain oder auch Macro Cosmos (wobei man die ersten beiden mit Cyberdark Invasion schießen kann, bei Macro Cosmos klappt das nicht da man die ausgerüstete Karte in den Friedhof befördern muss))</span>  <span><strong>Fazit:</strong></span>  <span>Ich habe mir schon immer guten Support für Cyberdark gewünscht und hatte viel Hoffnung für das Structure Deck.

Constellar is a little hand reliant and doesn’t have a lot of recovery but I tried to make it work. This build tries to abuse the fact that some Constellars are beasts and beast-warriors by taking a tri-brigade spin on it. The new card from BLVO is also really helpful to have. Because all of the Constellars are light monsters I added galaxy soldier and nova/infinity to the mix as well. Nova’s summoning effect even gets use sometimes to summon Zuben(full names too long). I’m playing three star chart for resource gathering which helps a lot in the grind game. The bujins the extra deck help get more extension, the xyz monster takes franktell and kaus but it mills five which is really helpful at times.  If there’s any questions you have feel free to ask!"

Main point is over the combo is to get <a data-name=""Mare Mare"">Mare Mare</a> in the GY to special summon it off of Shaman of the Tenyi's effect to go into a one card Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara, So one of two boards you can go full combo is 1) <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara"">Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara</a>, and <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a> or 2) <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Draco Berserker of the Tenyi"">Draco Berserker of the Tenyi</a>, and <a data-name=""Vanity's Fiend"">Vanity's Fiend</a>. Most of the time your board may just have <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a>, <a data-name=""Monk of the Tenyi"">Monk of the Tenyi</a>, and <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara"">Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara</a>.  You also want to try and have all different attribute Tenyi Spirits in the GY because there graveyard banish effect is a hard once per turn. The ones to make sure you have over the combo are <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Shthana"">Tenyi Spirit - Shthana</a>, <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna"">Tenyi Spirit - Ashuna</a>, and <a data-name=""Tenyi Spirit - Mapura"">Tenyi Spirit - Mapura</a>.  The two main weak point of the deck is when <a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi"">Shaman of the Tenyi</a> activating its effect, it's a hard choke point to recover from if it's negated but if you have <a data-name=""Monk&lt;a data-name=&quot;Shaman of the Tenyi&quot;&gt; of the Tenyi&lt;/a&gt;"">Monk</a><a data-name=""Shaman of the Tenyi""> of the Tenyi</a> on the field you can pivot into a <a data-name=""Berserker of the Tenyi"">Berserker of the Tenyi</a> and protect it with the level 4 Tenyi Spirits you have in the GY, also this deck has real protect against spells/traps, non targeting effects, and send/return effects."

Summon Demise and nuke the opponents board ,"Hey everyone, tried my hands at a Demise Ritual Deck, as I played him way back when he came out. It is inspired by other Demise decks on YGO Prodeck, but I tweaked it to my own liking.  The deck itself is pretty self explanatory, try to get Demise out, best with Sauravis in the hand for protection and then nuke the board. His battle protection and Sauravis should let him survive the enemy turn and then you wipe the board again and finish up the game. Impcantations and Manju included for consistency, Danger! Thunderbird for the XYZ Plays if you can only get the standard Demise out, but you can of course play better engines. Its pretty fun to wipe the board, but the protection of Demise is not too great so watch out for those Handtraps and Negates.  Hope you enjoy the deck and let me know if you have any improvements/ideas."

Optimally, your best hand going first will be<strong> ZS - Ascend Sage</strong>, <strong>ZS - Arms Sage</strong>, and access to a Rank 4 through <strong>Onomatoparia</strong> or by hard drawing like <strong>Utopic Onomatopoeia</strong> and either <strong>Zubababancho</strong> or <strong>Dodododwarf</strong>. Your end board is 2 monster negates, a spell negate, and I guess battle ensurance.  Then you get an additional monster negate on your opponent's turn. </span>  <span><strong>Arms Sage</strong> and <strong>Ascend Sage</strong> are hear specifically to search <strong>Hope Force</strong> and <strong>ZW - Lighting Blade</strong>. 3 <strong>Utopia Onomatopoeia</strong> since it is access to a Rank 4 when hard drawing it and another <strong>Onomat</strong> name or through <strong>Onomatoparia</strong>. 3 <strong>Zubababancho Gagagacoat</strong> summons itself from hand and the 1 <strong>Dodododwarf Gogogoglove</strong> summons itself from grave. 1 <strong>ZW - Lightning Blade</strong> for destruction protection and 1 <strong>ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber</strong> which is 1 of your negates and its sadly a garnet. And 3 <strong>Ash</strong>. </span>  <span>For Spells/Traps we play 1 <strong>ROTA</strong>, 1 <strong>ZEXAL Entrust</strong> which can really just be <strong>Reborn</strong> at this point, 1 <strong>Rank-Up-Magic ZEXAL Force</strong> which is just here if you want to summon <strong>Utopia Ray V </strong>for removal, and 1 <strong>Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Hope Force</strong> which summons <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong> and is an essential part in getting your negates through its attach from grave effect. 3 <strong>ZEXAL Construction</strong>, 3 <strong>Generation Force</strong>, 3 <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong>, 3 <strong>Onomatoparia</strong>, 1 <strong>Double or Nothing</strong>, and 1 <strong>Called By</strong>. We are lastly playing 3 <strong>ZEXAL Field</strong> (which isnt in the database of this site yet) which prevents your opponent from negating your <strong>RUM</strong>s and it stacks the 1-of <strong>Shining Draw</strong> that you are running so that you can use its effect for fun I guess.</span>  <span>Extra Deck. 1<strong> Zeus</strong> since Xyz deck. 1 <strong>Number 99: Utopia Dragnar</strong> which is arguably <strong>Utopia Kaiser</strong> but better. 1 <strong>Number 99: Utopic Dragon</strong> since you can make it and it is a dragon for <strong>Draglubion</strong>. 1 <strong>Number 97: Draglubion</strong> which cannot be targeted and it gets you to more negates. 1 <strong>Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord</strong> which is a negate. 1 <strong>Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon</strong> which gets you <strong>Photon Lord</strong>'s destruction effect following its negation when you use <strong>ZEXAL Field</strong>. 1 <strong>Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy</strong> which is another negate. 1 <strong>Number 100: Numeron Dragon</strong> for OTKs going second. 1 <strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong> which is another negate. 1 <strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray V</strong> since I like its destruction and burn effect. 1 <strong>Number C39: Utopia Ray</strong> which ensures your <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong> has at least 4 materials. 1 <strong>Utopia Double</strong> and 3 vanilla <strong>Utopia</strong>.</span>  <span>Side Deck: Nothing Special. <strong>Nibiru</strong>, <strong>Cosmic</strong>, <strong>Droplet</strong>, <strong>Imperm</strong>. <strong>Xyz Import</strong> and <strong>Xyz Encore</strong> are cool since they can be searched. <strong>ZW - Tornado Bringer</strong> is here to side in against decks like <strong>Eldlich</strong> whose effect activates in hand. You can't negate it since your negates work ""on field"" only so <strong>Tornado Bringer</strong> prevents targeting.</span>  <span>Here's the Combo if you open the perfect hand of both<strong> ZS</strong> and <strong>Onomatoparia</strong>. <span><strong>(1)</strong> </span>Special <strong>ZS - Ascend Sage</strong> and then <strong>Special ZS - Arms Sage</strong>. <strong><span>(2) </span></strong>Xyz into <strong>Utopia Double</strong> and activate the effect to add a <strong>Zexal Weapon</strong> second to chain block against <strong>Ash</strong>. <span><strong>(3)</strong> </span>Search <strong>Hope Force</strong> and <strong>Lighting Blade</strong>. <span><strong>(4)</strong> </span>Use <strong>Onomatoparia</strong> and discard for cost: add any 2 <strong>Onomat</strong> names.<strong> <span>(5) </span></strong>Get both names onto the field and Xyz into normal <strong>Utopia</strong>. <span><strong>(6)</strong> </span>Rank-up into <strong>Utopia Ray</strong> and then activate <strong>Hope Force</strong> to Summon <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong>. <strong><span>(7) </span>Utopia Dragnar</strong> detach 2 to summon <strong>Draglubion</strong>. <strong><span>(8) </span>Hope Force</strong> attaches to <strong>Draglubion</strong> from grave. <strong><span>(9) </span>Draglubion</strong> detach summon <strong>Hope Harbinger</strong> and attach either <strong>Utopic Dragon</strong> or <strong>Numeron Dragon</strong>. <strong><span>(10) </span>Utopia Double</strong> detach add <strong>Double or Nothing</strong> and rank-up into <strong>Leo Utopia Ray</strong>. <strong><span>(11) </span></strong>Equip <strong>Lighting Blade</strong> to it and detach to equip <strong>Pegasus Twin Saber</strong>. <strong><span>(12) </span></strong>Next turn, activate <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong> again to summon <strong>Photon Lord</strong> and equip <strong>Hope Force</strong> from grave.  Thats the usual combo but you can do more based on what you draw. If you have <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong> then great. If you have <strong>ZEXAL Field</strong> activated, then attach <strong>Prime Photon Dragon</strong> from your Extra Deck to add destruction to <strong>Photon Lord</strong>'s negation. If you drew more <strong>Onomat</strong> names off of <strong>Xyz Change Tactics</strong>, then you can even make <strong>Utopia Ray V</strong> if you also drew <strong>ZEXAL Force</strong>.</span>  <span>Going second, just make <strong>Utopia Dragnar</strong>, summon <strong>Draglubion</strong>, summon <strong>Numeron Dragon</strong> and attack for big boy damage.</span>  <span>This deck hard loses to effects that activate in hand since all of your negations are only for on field effects. You can play according to this by summoning <strong>Photon Lord</strong> off of <strong>Dragnar</strong> first to play around things like <strong>Nibiru</strong>,<strong> Gamma</strong>, and <strong>D.D. Crow</strong> (<strong>Ash</strong> isnt that big of a problem), but you need<strong> ZEXAL Field</strong> activated in order to attach <strong>Prime Photon Dragon</strong> for the destruction part of <strong>Photon Lord</strong>'s effect to occur. You can even play <strong>Terraforming</strong> instead of something like the <strong>Shining Draw</strong> if you really want to play around handtraps, but you also need to remember that this is not a ""<strong>Photon</strong>"" or ""<strong>Galaxy</strong>"" deck so you can only negate and have the destruction effect once.</span>"

Deus X-Krawler & Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon!,"This deck was built around Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx, which is coming out in the TCG June 4th 2021 in Lightning Overdrive.  Fittingly, I'm using 3 Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx, and one Arsenal Summoner to search it to the hand from the deck.  Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx floats into the original Guardian Sphinx so I'm running one of those.  These cards are flip monsters, so I want to be able to set them face-down, which basically limits me to normal summoning.  To enable me to normal set high-level monsters, I'm using Mausoleum of the Emperor.  Since I can use Red-Eyes Fusion during the same turn that I set a monster, I'm running a maximum Red-Eyes engine for Dragoon. Since I want to be able to search Mausoleum of the Emperor, I'm also using set rotation.  To use set rotation, I added the field spell Trickstar Lightstage, which searches Candina, which searches Corobane for a free special summon that allows you to make Verte Anaconda.  In addition, light stage can pop traps or easily force your opponent to activate Mausoleum of the Emperor which you can use even from their side of the field.  Another great card to normal set with Mausoleum of the Emperor is Deus X-Krawler.  An opening field of Deus X and Dragoon is surprisingly hard to break.  Since Deus X Krawler floats into a level 9, I added Jurrac Titano.  I only run two hand traps, Nibiru which is searchable by Gallant Granite, and Ghost Sister &amp; Spooky Dogwood to get more LP for summoning. If you have any ideas for improvements please leave a comment!"
