LETS WIN HERO PLAYERS. ","<span>IDEA </span>  Basically dark law turbo, alot of strong decks this format can't play thru dark law. The only problem is people have ways to out dark law, but you just have to play smart and protect the dark law at all costs.  <span>GOING FIRST</span>  Getting out dark law is the most important thing, then you need to back it up with something else like a dystopia or sunrise or have the super poly ready. Sometimes it is worth going for double dark law because outing one is easy but alot of decks cannot out two, but sometimes double dark law is overkill. With sunriser you can stop someone from trying to attack over dark law by using its pop effect. Same idea with dystopia you just need his Atk to be boosted. Also plasma dark law is very strong.  <span>GOING SECOND</span>  Going second is interesting , it isn't smart to go dark law second. Going second I would try to get out a Sunriser or plasma, preferable both. Trinity is good here aswell. Just do not over kill. Alot of hero players try to make this super fun or the biggest board they can and over commit then lose their board and all their follow up. Do not over commit and play smart. Unless you are 100% sure the other player has 0 outs.  <span>HERO CORE RATIOS</span>  Alot of people are gonna hate me for this but Stratos at 3 is silly. Imagine opening up a hand with just stratos as ur only engine piece, you have no play. So we use stratos at 2 for the hero lives, he is the only a hero lives target, and then the second one is for the grind game and or for utility for its second effect with backrow. Double liquid because Its good for draws and getting dark law out. Also can get you dark law or mask change in the grind game. My destiny hero engine is alittle weird, I cut the second normal destiny hero, so that we use either mali and celestial for D fusions and do not be afraid to use plasma for a fusion destiny. Using mask change 2 bc of dark law turbo but I would run 3 but it is a hard once per turn. So i run two only. searchers are at 2 E calls and 1 rota, and a hero lives. Remember to use e call or rota to bait out ashe if you have a hero lives.  <span>EVIL HEROS</span>  I do not play them but If you commit to a going second build I can see it doing well. The only problem with the going second build is that is chost like $800+ if you run evil heros and the good going second cards like droplet and lightning storm. So if you have the money for it It could be a good build, but I still like this turbo dark law better for the current meta. If everyone likes my profile I would happily put up a going second build that I think would be nice.  <span>HANDTRAPS/DISTRUPIONS </span>  I think called by is cracked but could be replaced if you like 3 straos or a different staple. Super poly right now is so strong, that is why I run it just like the Gren maju player who topped the event recently. If your deck can easily run super poly and it helps out ur engine as well, it is stupid to not run it. Also i play ashe generically but it can be sided out with any other good hand trap. The only problem is , do not run cards that conflict with dark law, like ghost belle. Also gamma is good but if you summon it on your own turn, ex. like activate a hero lives , they chain ashe, then you chain gamma, you are now locked out of using cross crusaders effect bc you special summoned a non hero monster. So keep that in mind. That is also the case with super poly, so if you need to use super poly make sure you do not need cross crusader that turn.  <span>EXTRA DECK</span>  Pretty basic, no anki bc i needed more room. Dian bc if they fog blade or imperm your solid soilder you can dodge it and dian helps get out dark law if you can attack with it. Normal ratios for everything else. Two spots for super poly target. Also you can use Trinity as a side spot to put in another super poly target.  <span>SIDE DECK</span>  Pretty standard, use the 9 spots for good hand traps for decks you think you will face. Always have cards for backrow decks. Also some super poly targets. World chalice dragon is good against decks that link alot. Borreload fusion for dragon link. Great tornado can out winda or appolusa with super poly, and the shining for mechaba and for the dino boss monster. Remember you can super poly with your own face down monsters."

Force your opponent to waste resources while you draw your deck as quickly as possible.,"Once Mystic Mine and Field Barrier are up you can spam draw spells and generate lots of advantage. As long as they have more monsters you can flip up worm linxes. There is some gas with the draw power that allow you to set things up quickly.  You really only need to get one appropriate online, the other 2 are just for consistency. You don't have to hold on to the One Day of Peace or worry about the timing of the draw spells, except for the pots. If you banish 6 cards with 3 pot of extravagance you won't be able to use pot of disparity so you have to keep that in mind.  If you start to die you can use the low life points and draw of fate to get to exodia quickly. A lot of the draw spells allow you to get all the cards from draw of fate just keep an eye on the ones that shuffle the deck like pot of duality"

Deck Strengths and Weaknesses </span> <p><span><strong>Strengths</strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>High versatility and flexibility</span></li>  	<li><span>High search power</span></li>  	<li><span>High chance to OTK if left uncontested</span></li>  	<li><span>Potential to play around hand traps and other negates</span></li>  	<li><span>Very consistent </span></li> </ul> <p><span><strong><span>Weaknesses </span></strong></span></p>  <ul>  	<li><span>Very dependent on the Extra Deck and multiple special summons</span></li>  	<li><span>Despite high search power, there is low draw power</span></li>  	<li><span>Somewhat dependent on luck when excavating</span></li> </ul> <span>II. Key Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><span>Adamancipator Tuners - While each has a different means of being summoned out, they all share the same effect: excavating the top 5 cards of your deck and special summoning a level 4 or lower non-tuner rock monster. In general, the easiest one to summon onto the field is <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> , followed by <a data-name=""Adamancipator Seeker"">Adamancipator Seeker</a> , and then <a data-name=""Adamancipator Analyzer"">Adamancipator Analyzer</a> . Researcher is a free special summon to your field as long as you control a rock monster. Seeker is a free special summon to your field as long as you control another Adamancipator monster (including synchros). Analyzer can only be special summoned if only your opponent controls monsters; he's easier to get out on the field going second compared to going first. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> - The reason this card works so well with this deck is that it is searchable by every adamancipator tuner, can be sent to the graveyard by <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> , and it's a one-card combo that starts your link climb. A single rocksies lets you link into <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu"">Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu</a> while special summoning a <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dropsies"">Prank-Kids Dropsies</a> (you can't summon a rocksies off of another rocksies, which is why we play 1 dropsies). You can also banish a card from your hand to draw 1 when rocksies is sent to the graveyard. You can then link climb again into <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> using dropsies as link material. When dropsies hits the graveyard from this, you gain 1000 LP and can summon another rocksies from your deck. So you essentially end on where you started with a Link 2 Monster. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Gallant Granite"">Gallant Granite</a> - I like going into this guy after link climbing from the prank-kids engine. He can be summoned pretty easily with all of the level 4's in the deck- and combos especially well with <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> if included in your opening hand. Gallant Granite lets you search for <span>any</span> rock type monster in your deck; adamancipator tuners or even <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> . I usually search for the adamancipator tuner I haven't played yet (usually <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> ). After using the effect, I usually use him for link material for the next link climb (usually into <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> ).</span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a> - This can be easily summoned out through the prank-kids engine as long as you already have a level 2 tuner monster. This card excavates the top 5 cards of your deck and can summon <span>any</span> rock type monster. Usually you want to summon out either: one of the adamancipator tuners that you haven't summoned or <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> if you haven't link climbed yet. This card also combos with <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> if it's in the graveyard. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a> - So...I'm part of the crowd that likes running Doki at 2 instead of 3. This is a monster that I love searching into instead of having it in my opening hand. It's for that reason and the fact that this monster requires a bit of setup that I run it at 2. This card does a great job at getting <a data-name=""Adamanipator Analyzer"">Adamanipator Analyzer</a> and <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> onto the field when you fail to search them. </span></li>  	<li><span>Koa'ki Meiru Monsters - I run 3 <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a> and 3 <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a> . These level 4 rocks are great to hit off of your adamancipator tuners. Koa'ki Meiru Guardian offers field protection and can potentially combo with <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> . Koa'ki Meiru Supplier does 2 things: it can add a Guardian to your hand when it's special summoned, and it can special summon itself to the field when a rock monster is sent from the field to the graveyard.</span></li> </ul> <span>III. Combos</span>  <span>Adamancipator Risens &amp; The Graveyard</span> <ul>  	<li><span>All Adamancipator Risens can excavate the top 5 cards of your deck for an effect; however, they also all have a secondary effect depending on if you have a certain attribute of monster in your graveyard. <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Raptite"">Adamancipator Risen - Raptite</a> can quick effect remove a card from your opponent's graveyard (kind of like a <a data-name=""Called by the Grave"">Called by the Grave</a> ) if there's a wind monster in your graveyard. Possible wind monsters: <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> and <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> . <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> can quick effect revive a rock monster from your graveyard during your opponent's turn if there's a fire monster in your graveyard. Possible fire monster: <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> . <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Dragite"">Adamancipator Risen - Dragite</a> can quick effect negate a spell/trap or effect if there's a water monster in your graveyard. Possible water monsters: <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dropsies"">Prank-Kids Dropsies</a> and <a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> . </span></li> </ul> <span>Adamancipator Tuners &amp; <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a></span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> is a very versatile card. It can combo with <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> and it can also guarantee you being able to excavate a level 4 or lower rock type monster when using the adamancipator tuners. Of note: <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> effect is not 'once per turn' and it can potentially be searched by <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> .</span></li> </ul> <span>Prank Kids Engine &amp; Links</span> <ul>  	<li><span>The prank-kids engine is a one-card combo that gives you a free link 2 monster on the field, making it easy to link climb to your 3's and 4's. You start with a <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> and end on a Prank-Kids Rocksies and a <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> . With how easy it is to swarm link material to the field, your end goal is to get the big link 4's out including <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> for offense or <a data-name=""Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess"">Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess</a> for more control. Link climbing really helps set up your main beaters being: <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and <a data-name=""Borreload Savage Dragon"">Borreload Savage Dragon</a> since you're likely to have <a data-name=""Knightmare Unicorn"">Knightmare Unicorn</a> in the graveyard to be used by both. </span></li> </ul> <span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> &amp; Ash Blossom &amp; <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a></span> <ul>  	<li><span>This combo is a bit situational only if you have <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> in hand and a <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Guardian"">Koa'ki Meiru Guardian</a> on the field. You can have Guardian tribute itself for a negate, then discard Ash for another negate. Since Ash is a fire attribute in the graveyard- Leonite can revive Guardian for another negate since it's effect isn't once per turn (total of 3 negates). </span></li> </ul> <span>IV. Tech Cards</span> <ul>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Revival Golem"">Revival Golem</a> - Primarily going to be a <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> target. Helps with rank 4 XYZ summoning and some synchro plays. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a> - This is your secondary <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> target and also the only monster you can use to synchro summon into <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> . Keep in mind you need a rock monster (and only rock monsters) on the field for this to revive from the graveyard. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> - Another level 4 rock monster to use for XYZ or Synchro plays. It also helps with this deck's lack of draw power (not that it's needed, but it helps). </span></li> </ul> <span>V. Addressing Weaknesses</span> <ol>  	<li><span>This deck definitely struggles if you're locked out of using your extra deck since most of your combos and extenders involve using the extra deck. The good thing about the combos with this deck is that none of them rely on spell or trap support. If an opponent's spell or trap is preventing you from getting to your extra deck, you side in spell/trap negate such as <a data-name=""Imperial Order"">Imperial Order</a> or <a data-name=""Royal Decree"">Royal Decree</a> (especially since this deck doesn't use trap cards). If an opponent's monster is preventing you from getting to your extra deck, you could use cards such as <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> or destruction cards such as <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> or <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> for budget. </span></li>  	<li><span>Despite this deck constantly throwing out special summons, it does not struggle heavily with <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> . It might be a slight inconvenience to get Nibiru'd, but more often than not- you can recover. You could special summon <a data-name=""Adamancipator Researcher"">Adamancipator Researcher</a> since the token is a rock monster or you could trigger summon <a data-name=""Koa'ki Meiru Supplier"">Koa'ki Meiru Supplier</a> since your rock monsters would be tributed to summon the token. If your opponent locks you out of special summoning, then you may need to side in some extra cards for spell/trap/effect negation. </span></li>  	<li><span>This deck does an amazing job searching for rock monsters, but not for your handtraps or other tech cards like <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> . Besides what you get in your opening hand, there aren't many ways to draw cards aside from using <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Rocksies"">Prank-Kids Rocksies</a> or <a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> . Before reworking my extra deck, I used <a data-name=""Saryuja Skull Dread"">Saryuja Skull Dread</a> to make up for the lack of draw power. I ended up cutting Saryuja in my extra deck since I preferred using other links, but he can be solid for the draw power and combo extension. </span></li>  	<li><span>Despite how consistent this deck is, there will always be some form of luck factor when using the adamancipator tuner effects. You could excavate the top 5 cards of your deck to hit 3 rock monsters, other times 1, and other times 0. Because of this, combos and strategies need to be thought up on the spot and require quick thinking. <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> is a way to manipulate this luck factor by putting a level 4 or lower rock monster at the top of your deck. <a data-name=""Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite"">Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite</a> can also recycle itself to the top of the deck if Risen Dragite is on the field or in the graveyard (Risen Dragite returns to the extra deck). <a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a> is another option as a tech card to force a level 4 or lower rock monster from your hand to the top of your deck.</span></li> </ol> <span>VI. Tips and Tricks</span> <ol>  	<li><span>This deck excels more when going first to build a solid board full of negates. </span> <ol>  	<li><span>Going second isn't ideal, but it's fine with the amount of hand traps in the deck (8 total handtraps)</span></li>  	<li><span>This deck doesn't offer much spell/trap or monster destruction for going second, so <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> , <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> , <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> , <a data-name=""Raigeki"">Raigeki</a> , etc. are good cards to side in when needed.</span></li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span>If you're trying to bait handtraps, <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> is usually a good card to bait it with, followed by the adamancipator tuners (granted you can guarantee having at least 2 monsters on the field). You 110% do not want to get handtrapped if you normal summon <a data-name=""Doki Doki"">Doki Doki</a> without a follow up. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> is situational, aside from searching for <a data-name=""Adamancipator Signs"">Adamancipator Signs</a> or one of the tuners, you probably will want to synchro him away if you don't have <a data-name=""Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring"">Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</a> in your graveyard. </span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"">Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon</a> can be summoned easily when using Risen Leonite or Raptite as material. </span></li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""PSY-Framegear Gamma"">PSY-Framegear Gamma</a> is a good handtrap when going second; however, you can still use its effect with monsters on the field when <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Lambda"">PSY-Framelord Lambda</a> is on the field. </span> <ol>  	<li><span>This doesn't come up often, but you can also special summon this through <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a>. </span></li> </ol> </li>  	<li><span>This deck revolves around a certain combo path that depends with what you have in your opening hand. Ideally you want to go into your big link monsters first and then go into your big synchro monsters. </span></li>  	<li><span>This deck is very handtrap friendly because of all the possible one-card combos, so if you feel the need to side in more negates- could take out some of the tech cards such as <a data-name=""Parallel eXceed"">Parallel eXceed</a> or <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> package. </span></li> </ol> <span>VII. Side Deck &amp; Other Deck Options</span> <ol>  	<li><span>I like using <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> for spell negate, but if you want to replace that and <a data-name=""Sentry Soldier of Stone"">Sentry Soldier of Stone</a>, then <a data-name=""Tackle Crusader"">Tackle Crusader</a> is another good <a data-name=""Miracle Rupture"">Miracle Rupture</a> target and <a data-name=""Herald of the Arc Light"">Herald of the Arc Light</a> is another good synchro to use.</span></li>  	<li><span>If you want to abuse the <a data-name=""Adamancipator Risen - Leonite"">Adamancipator Risen - Leonite</a> combo more, you can replace <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo"">Prank-Kids Dodo-Doodle-Doo</a> with <a data-name=""Prank-Kids Bow-Wow-Bark"">Prank-Kids Bow-Wow-Bark</a> to use as a fire monster for your graveyard. </span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""Plaguespreader Zombie"">Plaguespreader Zombie</a> is another good tech option to help set up for synchro plays and adamancipator tuner deck excavation (replace one of the Miracle Ruptures with <a data-name=""Foolish Burial"">Foolish Burial</a> if trying this)</span></li>  	<li><span>I use <a data-name=""Crystron Halqifibrax"">Crystron Halqifibrax</a> to change out my tuner levels if needed, but if you want to use its secondary effect, I'd consider replacing one of the extra deck monsters with <a data-name=""Desert Locusts"">Desert Locusts</a> .</span></li> </ol>"

Both archetype's playstyle compliment each other, Evil★Twin can be used to pop Cursed Eldlad and it can provide extra disruption, while the Eldlich will take care of the grind game. The only problem of this deck that it's playstyle is so linear, if your opponent negates the right card, you'll be having a hard time winning that match. That's why you need to predict what disruptions will your opponent will use and when to commit or just play safe.  &nbsp;  <strong><span>Main Deck Explanation</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Evil★Twin Cards - So this engine runs the typical ratios of: 3 Ki-sikill, 3 Lil-la, 3 Entrace, and 1 Secret Password, this cards is all you need to run when you're playing it alongside Eldlich, adding any other Evil★Twin cards or Cynet Mining will just make the deck more easire to stop.</li>  	<li>Eldlich Cards - I run 2 Golden Lord, 3 Cursed Eldland, 3 Scarlet Sanguine, 3 Conquistador, 1 White Destiny, and 2 Huaquero, I only run 2 Golden Lord since running it at 3 will be bricky, you have many ways to search for it. I only run 2 Huaquero  just to have extra access to Sanguine.</li>  	<li>Nibiru - A good card in today's fast paced gameplay.</li>  	<li>Ash Blossom - Self Explanatory. Most useful card in today's game.</li>  	<li>Ghost Belle - A good hand trap in today's meta since a lot of decks has GY reliant plays.</li>  	<li>Pot of Prosperity - The most expensive card in this deck, this card fixes the brick problem of this deck.</li>  	<li>Called by the Grave - Self Explanatory card. Too bad it's limited.</li>  	<li>Ice Dragon's Prison - A really good card to disrupt your opponent since it can banish 2 monsters from your opponent.</li>  	<li>Imperial Order - A protection against backrow removal with a bonus of negating your opponent's spell cards.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Extra Deck Explanation</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>N'tss - To be honest i just put this card just to be used as a cost for prosperity. It's just a bonus if your opponent runs Dogmatika Maximus since you can use it to bait your opponent's negate.</li>  	<li>Pleiades - You can use the Huaquero and Conquistador to summon this card. A good card to disrupt your opponent's play while sending your Eldlich trap cards to the GY.</li>  	<li>Unchained Abomination - This card can let you control a game if you have right resources.</li>  	<li>Knightmares - So i run all Knightmares except gryphon, since their effects can come in clutch especially Unicorn. Also it's easier in this deck to maximize the co-link effects of Knightmares thanks to Evil★Twin.</li>  	<li>Evil★Twins - A self explanatory cards since you're using the Evil★Twin engine.</li>  	<li>Link Spider - I use this card just to send my summoned Eldlich trap card to the GY.</li> </ul> <strong><span>Side Deck Explanation:</span></strong> <ul>  	<li>Lancea - A good card in today's meta game since a lot of deck needs to banish cards in order to continue their combo. Some people put this card in the main deck, it's good but you need to analyze first your area's meta game before putting this card in the main deck.</li>  	<li>Harpie's Feather Duster - A must card if you're facing backrow deck.</li>  	<li>Dark Ruler No More - Literally a card that will let you play against combo decks that has an endboard of many negates.</li>  	<li>Cosmic Cyclone - Also a must have card when facing a backrow deck.

This deck is mainly geared towards spamming the board using U.A's and generic warriors with easy special summoning conditions, like Fire Flint Lady and Red Layer. The main idea is to spam the board with monsters like Fire Flint and Red Layer at first, and then normal summon Midfielder to get more bodies on field for an automatic link 4. I built this deck so it can consistently get to Midfielder, using 2 field spells to search him, and Foolish Burial Goods to send  Penalty Box to search said field spells,  or if you already have them, Signing Deal for more field swarming. You also have Player Manager to get even more bodies on board, so with an ideal hand, you can get up to 5 bodies on board, meaning a link-4 and material to bounce back and force with U.A effects, as long as you leave a U.A on board. Isolde helps with leaving that board state in tact, as it can turn a Jersey into a Fire Flint Lady for combos. The extra deck is pretty  generic- Isolde is a great extender for the deck, as you can search for turn 2 and use Jersey to summon out a Flint lady to extend your plays. I also included generic Knightmares for removal, Missus Radiant if you have a ton of U.A's, and a few XYZ. The link 4's are the special part of this deck. Borrelsword is the OTK part of the deck, helping a lot to OTK when going second. Accescode is great as a going 1st option, and same with Powerload, as Powerload is a pretty strong towers. Any suggestions are appreciated. Have fun!"

First of a replay so you get an Idea : https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=447320-27026681  Now lets find something else to combo to. This time we focus on instead of not letting our opponent play, we will just make it so they cant interact with our cards and we throw as many stone in their way as possible. To make it simple I will copy my explantions for each card from the last list, just updated for all thats new.  Also remember, Laundry is the best Maid, even if she is the worst card.  Well I assume you are here to look at one of the endless versions of Dragonmaid decks. Its the reason why this archtype became a fan favorite since its launch. You can play controll, stun, combo, 40 cards, 60 cards. Throw pots in, or throw them out ones you see that there is no money left after buying 3 Hospitality. Orrrr you are here for the waifus. Hey I dont judge, aslong as we agree that Drident is best maid.  Lets go over it card by card and talk about the goal we have with this deck.  The dragonmaid core :  3 Chamber : Searches you the fusion spell, hospi to extend, tidying to extend if you have ravine or to set for controll. She is one of the 1 card sphere maker and what is really important, she is the only one able to summon the fusion maids from grave at the start of the bp.  3 Parlor : Basically works the same as chamber and does almost all the same. Only difference she can send tidying directly for combo, but cant gets its controll eff. However if you already have extender in hand she is a good way to get nurse or any other maid you may need later to grave. Also a 1 card sphere  1 Nurse : She is one of the cards holding the deck together. Overworked nurses are sadly also part in a fantasy card game, thats why you want to use her every turn to extend and summon more maids. She is basically a flat +1 or +2 everytime you summon her ones the grave is set.  2 Changeover : Your fusion spell to go into the gem of the deck Dragonmaid Sheou/Strahl, or House when you are lead down the dark path of VFD. Important to remember for the gy effect, even if the target leaves the board, you still add changeover to hand.  3 Hospitality : Probably one of the most broken extender to ever be printed. Set up your grave, non target summon from hand and gy. Searchable and one activation a turn no use. Sadly the price tag is justified, but dont buy it if you can avoid. Dont let people sky rock the price and gate people out. the reprint is coming !  3 Tidiyng : Looping cards back to hand and in best case triggering your House is always good, but non target summon from hand or gy in etiher players turn while being searchable by two cards ? This card should be the 40$ one~  &nbsp;  Rokket :  2 Tracer : Its tracer, it summons another rokket for a free Chaos ruler or Savage Dragon, and can be summoned by quick launch. Yeah, I dont know how quick launch and this can exist at the same time.  1 Absoruter : As we play Ravine we love discarding things that also give us free cards back so this card is already good for us, but it can also work as a mini noctovision dragon if we have a rokket on board. Dragon, free summon and search? Sign me up  1 Silver : Wont come up often but the banish eff can be nice  1 Recharger : target for quicklaunch and tracer, but also can work with striker dragon eff to recycle a tracer back to hand and summon 2 of boot sector <ol>  	<li>Boot Sector : Summon striker, search this spam rokkets. Simple</li> </ol> Dragons :  3 Noctovision : Make striker = free summon. Simple. gives you a extra draw and protects your set tidying when in grave, this card is basically a dragonmaid. Since its release its been probably the most played card which isnt part of the archtype.  2-3 Fantastical Dragon Phantazmay : With dragon link and other link decks running around, its just a nice card to have, also it fixed goddess weakness of being targeted + its a high level dragon to fusion.  1 Dragons Ravine : Search of Romulus and dumb extender and send extender.  1 Tempest 1 Gold Sako : Simple combo to search Miradora or Parlor  Hand traps : 3 Ash + 2 Bell. Could be anything, just increase amount and decreas and change which to use depending on meta / what is played were you play.  Extra :  1x Dragonmaid Sheou : Its your best card, its your free summon omni negate, waifu, dragon. Also we play only one because she shuffels herself back.  2x House Dragonmaid : So we can use Sheou omni negate, or pop a whole opponents board. We can shuffel her back and usually dont need more  1x Borrel Savage : Omni negate, whats to say. Sadly not a maid  1x Chaos Ruler : More draw and can resummon it self if needed. Also can send tidying which is a insane + for us  1x Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess : If we dont go into Underworld Goddess, we usually go into her with I:p for the nice negates  1x Romulus : Searches Dragon Ravine for you and is a good link 2 target with good zones  1x Pitsy and Elpy : The extender dragons which hopefully get banned soon. Usually made with Nurse + any maid  1x Sphere : One of the stronges interrupts in the game + free summon from deck + good zones + being a dragon  1x I:p  : We need her to link summon in the opponents turn + she is dark so rokket is a 1 card combo to her  1x Knightmare Unicorn : Generic link 3 which you can summon from I:P for another Interrupt  1x Striker Dragon : link 1. dragon. searches boot sector launch. the only thing this thing misses is a it pointing downwards  1x Underworld Goddess of the Closed World : The new card we try to abuse, or atleast flex with. We usually will always summon her with I:p but its not to hard  summon her with all the dragons and maids rotating at all times. She also doesnt care about DRM and all the annoying things being played. Laughing at Dragoon with her only being outed in battle  1x Link God Dragon/ Fiveheaded Link Dragon : We want to make him almost every turn, as your opponent will 99,99% not play anything that can out this thing. You will have a full grave for atleast 3-4 turns were you could just sit on it , but as you play maids, you will just combo again and again with a 5k beater who cant be stopped.  &nbsp;  All in all this deck is just learning which card leads to which combo, but the end board you should aim for is usually Sphere + Sheou or ones you know the cards a little better you can end on  Borrel Savage + I:P + Five headed link dragon + Sheou = I:P + the maids summoned by Shoeu go into the new Link 5 and steal another Monster from the opponent  Borrel Savage + Sphere + Sheou  or if we eat to many hand traps, just a classic Sphere + Sheou  &nbsp;  If wanted I can later add a few replays to show combos and how the deck performs against meta / ranked on DB"

Who doenst love shaddolls, am i right? And of course the favorite non banned card Dragoon:)  its kinda the same as the others deck profiles but i like a couple of other ratio's.  So why no dogmatika? <ol>  	<li>if youre broke its kinda obvi you cant play the core</li>  	<li>its still good and maybe slightly better without the dogmatika (my humble opinion).</li>  	<li>Its kinda generic and easy to counter, while it locks you out of the extra deck and the extra deck is your heart and soul.</li>  	<li>Yes, what im about to say now is contradicting number 3 but the invoked package itself is good synergy but faces its drawbacks and yes i know a special summoned eclassia is good with the potential search of fleur dump of ash or maximus, but trust me normal summon aleister wins everytime ;)</li> </ol> Why 3 shaddoll fusion and 2 el shaddoll fusions?  Shaddoll fusion in this format is crazy good, your opponent will always have a extra deck monster. Yes you can ash the shaddoll fusion but your opponent burns there recources while you can activate anything else afterwards.  So with that in mind i chose to cut el shaddoll fusion to 2x.  3x times nibiru and 3x times ash: nibiru is a light monster so construct material and while dragon link is still dominating you need to have the nibiru to somewhat slow them down. Ash is Ash need no explanation.  Shaddoll core is every attribute you need but especially for shekhinaga (wich is underrated af, negate a special summoned monster effect while dumping a shaddoll card, im confused in why nobody is playing this more often).  2x beast because plussing is always lovely.  And last but not least, invoked package: because normal summon aleister and magical meltdown is still broken af.  extra deck is kinda standard tbh nothing special there.  maybe switch the shekinhaga for a second caliga to floodgate your opponent but everything works for me with these 15 cards.  extra deck:  i would always run 3x dimension shifter, 2x cosmic cyclone and harpies and if youre expecting alot of imperial orders side in heavy storm duster 3x and for this deck 3x ghost belle to protect.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"

There was no other way I could seem to build this deck without the use of Nekroz. The board it typically ends on is Unicorn and Ruler. I also tried to make the deck as budget-friendly as possible. So yeah as for things like Anima, you can just put a second Linkuriboh. And Nibiru can be replaced with a handtrap of your choice. Honestly, this is a more fun build that can be semi-competitive. If I had to make any recommendations, honestly just buy at least one Nova, cause it just makes the deck that much better, and also the reason I'm not playing terraforming.  The main combo is using Thuban and Aldhiban to special them and search for your Kaleidoscope and Ruler. Then you can search Unicorn off of many things, or add the Drytron ritual monster and ritual spell instead. Your board is going to try to look as good as suppressive as possible. You can use Asterism as another form of interruption, and that's mainly what Fafnir does other than searching the ritual spell.  As for side decking, You mainly want to replace the Fafnir for any handtrap or your choice. The other Drytron ritual monster can replace the other in case you are facing a backrow heavy deck. The Nekroz ritual monster replaces the Trish and the Mirror replaces Cycle based on preference. The other 6 slots can be used on whatever you want.  Please don't judge me for doing this, I tried really hard. Budget recommendations are appreciated, so yeah have fun with this deck."

The deck's playstyle is focused around setting up the field with negates (primarly with Fog Blade), preventing opponent from activating effects and then on your next turn use Sword and Bardiche to clean as much as possible from opponents field and end it with either field full of 2000+ ATK monsters or over 9000 ATK Arc XYZ Dragon.  &nbsp;  I tested this deck in many duels until I put together the right cards that made it work and then tested it in another 20 duels.  Win rate is 85% (17/20) what is pretty good in in opinion.  (First duel I lost was againts Altergeist who went first so it was already over, the other 2 were because of brick hands)  &nbsp;  In 11 duels I played first and won 9 of those (1 of those was brick hand).  In other 9 I played second and won 8 of those.  It is clear that you have good chances of winning no matter if you go first or second, but I think going first gives you maybe 10% more chance of winning since you can set up your field.  &nbsp;  I had 4 OTKs (20%) during testing and only 2 brick hands (10%).  &nbsp;  Draw power is a total 0, but there are enough search effects that I don't think they are needed.  Twin Twisters are there to get rid of annoying or set spells/traps and to get some monsters in GY for future combos.  Accesscode is a second option for boss monster and Apollosa is there for extra negates.  Dante is good for getting resources, Leviar is for getting one more monster to the field for combos or summoning, Nightmare is nice since it can set up to 2 opponent's monsters when they are summoned.  &nbsp;  The main play is getting Bardiche to the field, set 1-2 Fog Blades, Artifact Scythe and Impermanence and then bring out XYZ and prepare for future plays.  &nbsp;  Now for those who think Tour Guide doesn't belong here's a simple 1 card combo to set up 2 monster negates or 1 negate+1 destruction (and there's chance you'll get at least 1 more negate with other cards from the hands)  &nbsp;  NS (normal summon) Tour Guide  SS (special summon) Cir (recomanded for opening plays) or Graff (recomanded for later plays)  SS Cherubini  Trigger Cir effect and SS either Scarm or Farfa or Graff to revive them from GY  Send either Cloak or Scales to HY with Cherubini effect  SS Bardiche  If you used Scarm use it to seatch any BA or Tour Guide at EP or if you used Farfa banish opponent's monster until EP (recomanded for finishing plays)  Use Bardiche to send either Cloak or Scales to GY (depanding on what you sent with Cherubini) and then set either Fog Blade or PK RUM Force  Banish Cloak and search Greaves  Use Scales' effect to SS it from GY and then use Greaves' effect to SP it from hand (keep it at lvl 3)  Use Scales to discard and send Boots to GY  Banish Boots to search either Fog Blade or PK RUM Force and set the card  SS Sword with Scales and Greaves (SS it next to Bradiche's link only if there's a card on opponent's field)  If opponent has a monster use Sword to kamize it and then revive Greaves and Scales and summon either R4 XYZ  If you want to destroy another opponent's monster SS Raider's Knight, use it's effect to SS 2nd Sword and repeat the play  On opponent's turn you can use RUM Force to SS either Raider's Knight or any XYZ Dragon to trigger Bardiche's effect and destroy another opponent's card or destroy Scythe if you have it set to lock opponent's ED  &nbsp;  There are couple more smaller combos which you'll easly learn by playing the deck (like how to get Arc Dragon over 10K ATK)  &nbsp;  EDIT: I noticed I uploaded a version with Droplet, Belle and Bringandine. I used multiple decks and kept them all to compare them later.

The requirements one must match to summon and keep them alive are absolutely bonkers specific, but this list attempts to play within them and get things online. Lots of traps, tutors, and long-term growth to attempt and stop plays and eventually kill with either <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a> or a stalled-out <a data-name=""Wave-Motion Cannon"">Wave-Motion Cannon</a>.  45 cards, so three points. First two points are spent on two additional copies of <a data-name=""Dark Factory of Mass Production"">Dark Factory of More Production</a>, and the last is spent 50/50 on <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Pot of Extravagance"">Pot of Extravagance</a>.  The majority of raw card advantage in this list comes from <a data-name=""Dark Factory of More Production"">Dark Factory of More Production</a>, with <a data-name=""Legacy of the Duelist"">Legacy of the Duelist</a> occasionally blowing people out in a similar fashion. Cards like <a data-name=""Scapeghost"">Scapeghost</a>, <a data-name=""House Duston"">House Duston, and </a><a data-name=""Kinka-byo"">Kinka-byo</a> create bodies, and those bodies can be used with the aforementioned cards. All of this (hopefully) leads to having a solid hand, board control, a mild bit of recursion, and a whole lot of countermagic.  Dustons, despite not being usable in a myriad of summoning methods, are just fine with being linked. This means that after poofing a <a data-name=""House Duston"">House Duston</a>, some modest link plays can be made within the 3-summon limit. Of course, your opponent will get some Dustons as well which they're able to link next turn, so you'll need to keep that in mind. If you do end up giving the opponent some Dustons, you can make it harder for them to make use of them with either <a data-name=""Starduston"">Starduston</a> or <a data-name=""Archnemeses Protos"">Archnemeses Protos</a>."

The main idea is to normal summon the Lightsworns and mill to hell and back, in order to activate as many Shaddol effects as possible. Since Shaddols have tons of good effects in the graveyard, the Lightsworns are a great engine for milling tons of Shaddols. This allows you to then get some Shaddols on board using some graveyard effects, allowing you to fuse into Construct and/or Winda fairly easily. The final core part of the deck is a Chaos package, as since you dump so many monsters into the grave rapidly, you can use the Chaos package to get extra bodies on board and even more effects. If you can pull Levianeer off right, you can even get a hand rip going first, which is amazing. Overall, this is a pretty consistent control deck that can get out floodgates and beaters and generally a solid deck imo."

While it will not be a meta dominant deck, the unshackling of Cir and Graff should make it very clear that Burning Abyss is not to be looked down upon. Thanks to cards like <a data-name=""Torrential Tribute"">Torrential Tribute</a>, <a data-name=""Paleozoic Dinomischus"">Paleozoic Dinomischus</a>, <a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a>, and the newly released <a data-name=""Ice Dragon's Prison"">Ice Dragon's Prison</a>, Burning Abyss is more than able to hold its own going first against most of the format. Barring blow-out cards like <a data-name=""Lightning Storm"">Lightning Storm</a>, <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>, or a lucky snipe off of <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> or <a data-name=""Mystical Space Typhoon"">Mystical Space Typhoon</a>, the deck puts up a significant amount of pressure going 1st. While its ability to go 2nd is not as impressive, BA has a unique toolbox that allows it to bait out or remove some of the opponent's threats - potentially setting up for a Link 4 play with <a data-name=""Tour Guide from the Underworld"">Tour Guide from the Underworld</a> or a Rank 3 play into <a data-name=""Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder"">Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder</a>. And of course, BA, even in its newest iteration, still retains its bread and butter grind game that has led it to receive the title of ""the deck that never dies"". Cir, Graff, Dante, and Scarm are all fantastic cards that allow you to match pace with the likes of Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika, and Dragon Link should you be able to stabilize. With all of these traits and some smart siding, this is definitely one of the better formats to pick up your Malebranches of the Burning Abyss.  _________  <span><strong>Key Cards:</strong></span>  • <a data-name=""Tour Guide from the Underworld"">Tour Guide from the Underworld</a>: Yes, it is frail, but it is still the best card in the deck should it go off. Tour Guide is a ticket to Zeus, to <a data-name=""Borrelsword Dragon"">Borrelsword Dragon</a>, to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a>, and to just about every other meaningful monster in the deck, should it resolve. Even if you're not using it to explode, Tour Guide is a 1 card setup into I:P + Beatrice, or simply a Dante. This card cannot be overlooked, it simply offers unparalleled flexibility. <em>You just need to be careful </em><em>with cards like Nibiru, Impermanence, and Ash seeing increasing play.</em>  • <a data-name=""Fiendish Rhino Warrior"">Fiendish Rhino Warrior</a>: It's not a tour guide, but what it can enable might as well place it in the same tier.  The ability to send any Burning Abyss monster from the deck to the graveyard is extremely impactful. This effect allows Rhino to be used in a myriad of ways, whether that's making I:P + Beatrice (like Tour Guide) after being detached from a Dante to send Graff, or if it's to simply send Scarm for that valuable end phase search. Furthermore, its ability to protect your BAs from their self-destruction can allow you to extend on awkward boards, which is something that comes up from time to time and is highly valued.  • <a data-name=""Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: After a certain point in a game, this often becomes the card you look for the most. Why? Well it enables your grind, it allows you to access a myriad of other cards you've set up over time, and it allows you to recur resources in conjunction with Dante. Cir is extremely impactful thanks to its effect that allows it to Special Summon a Burning Abyss monster from the graveyard.  • <a data-name=""Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: A Hero Lives type effects have always been powerful, and one that is as easy to activate - and as flexible - as Graff is extremely powerful. Being able to tutor out any BA, or simply being able to extend, is extremely powerful in a deck like BA that can take advantage of graveyard effects by linking off bodies on the field.  • <a data-name=""Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss"">Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss</a>: Definitely not the most highly touted card, and considering it's at 1 in my list you may wonder I'm bringing it up at all. Well, it's because Libic is a powerful enabler. Libic enables specific combos and makes awkward hands less awkward, and it does it in a way that no other BA really can, which is something that's worth mentioning. Specifically, Libic allows Tour Guide to cash in on a Link 4, almost immediately. Tour Guide Summoning Graff to make Cherubini, summoning Scarm off of Graff to a zone Cherubini points to is a play that brings out a lot of bodies - but accomplishes little in the respect of developing a board. However, with Libic in the deck, and a BA name in hand, Cherubini allows you to get a 4th body on-field - opening up several lines of play. It's definitely not the most interesting combo, but Libic's place in this combo alongside its general resourcefulness is meritorious enough to mention.  • <a data-name=""Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss"">Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss</a>: I'm certainly biased in this saying this, but I believe I'm pretty correct in saying it, Dante is one of the best rank 3s ever printed. The ability to mill 3 cards can be pretty powerful, especially in a deck like this where there are a lot of good cards to mill, but that's not the only way that Dante contributes. Its ability to swing for 2500 can be valuable, the fact that it is a Burning Abyss name is also valuable, but more than anything else, its non once per turn <a data-name=""Warrior Returning Alive"">Warrior Returning Alive</a> effect that triggers when sent to the graveyard, is incredible. It not only allows you to cycle back Cir, which can then revive your Dante to repeat this loop, but it allows you to bring back any BA. That is huge in a grind game, especially when you can resolve this effect of Dante multiple times.  • <a data-name=""Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal"">Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal</a>: She is still at 1, and maybe for good reason, however that limitation doesn't stop Beatrice from being an incredibly important piece of Burning Abyss's arsenal. The ability to send a monster from the deck to the graveyard during either player turn gives Beatrice the unique ability to not only develop advantage and plays, but also the ability to disrupt the opponent - sometimes in astounding fashion (ex: Sky Scourge Norelas, albeit this is not a competitive plan &amp; I am simply referencing it to show the potential that Beatrice has).  • <a data-name=""Fiend Griefing"">Fiend Griefing</a>: Yes, every Trap in this deck is powerful, but what Fiend Griefing does is pretty impressive even among its Trap peers. The ability to send a BA to the graveyard on your opponent's turn, while you're shuffling a card from their graveyard into the deck allows Fiend Griefing to be both a disruption and setup card - or a two-for-one interruption. That flexibility is huge, and often this card feels as if it were tailor-made for BA.  _________  <span><strong>Options to consider for Extra/Main/Side:</strong></span>  Aside from ratio adjustments, there are a few cards that should be considered when building Burning Abyss variants.  • Extra Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Topologic Zeroboros"">Topologic Zeroboros</a>: This card is very powerful if it resolves, allowing you to clear an entire board. Furthermore, you have cards like Fiend Griefing, Beatrice, a chained Dinomischus from GY, and Ice Dragon's Prison to resolve this card's effect on your opponent's turn. Do be wary though, it's an expensive investment at any point in the game, and you're left feeling fairly weak after it resolves in some situations.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Borreload Dragon"">Borreload Dragon</a>: This card's golden years are certainly behind it, but it is still a menace to deal with &amp; has a potentially game swinging effect.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Number 49: Fortune Tune"">Number 49: Fortune Tune</a>: This card is a more recent tech for more grind-intensive matchups. It has its merits, but we're not looking to get into that kind of an end game with this deck. Play if you value the cycle, ignore if you don't.</p> • Main Deck: <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a>: In this format Cyclone is just too good, both going 1st &amp; going 2nd. It always trades with a card that is critical for the opponent, or hard for you to play through, and I would certainly consider main decking it.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Absolute King Back Jack"">Absolute King Back Jack</a>: The saturation of Traps in our Deck is high enough to make Back Jack reliable, and 1 - 2 Back Jack is certainly something worth implementing should you have space. It improves your Dante mills and helps maintain or increase this deck's pressure throughout the game.</p> <p>-&gt; Dragoon Package: <a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda"">Predaplant Verte Anaconda</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>, <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Fusion"">Red-Eyes Fusion</a>, and your 2 Fusion targets. This package is extremely powerful on the right board, but it is not something I value highly format in this format. Given that most people are siding in Dark Ruler, this feels weak in games 2 &amp; 3 and there are generally plays that are equivalent to or better than Dragoon, with I:P + Beatrice on turn 1 and Zeus/Accesscode on turn 2 (or when going 2nd).</p> • Side Deck: <p>-&gt; Kaijus / <a data-name=""Lava Golem"">Lava Golem</a>: They don't help you win against Dragon Link as <a data-name=""Dark Ruler No More"">Dark Ruler No More</a> does, but they can be useful for outing combo boards as well as troublesome monsters like <a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a> and <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a>. (It should be noted that an Invoked Shaddoll player can utilize Schism to play through your Kaiju and set up a second Winda.)</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Forbidden Droplet"">Forbidden Droplet</a>: Another card that fulfills the same role as Dark Ruler, albeit with more swing potential. I don't play it over Dark Ruler because it doesn't synergize as well with this variant of BA given that we play a high number of Traps and are unlikely to find many cards that we want to discard as consistently.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Droll &amp; Lock Bird"">Droll &amp; Lock Bird</a>: Nearly every deck in the current format does not appreciate playing under Droll, the issue is that there are still plenty of Decks that can create a problematic board through Droll. It is certainly one of the better hand traps in this format, it is just hard to warrant playing hand traps in this Deck when you value cards that trade more consistently and efficiently.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>: Not often a game-winner on its own, and hence why it is being offered as a recommendation, Nibiru can end a Dragon Link or Bird Up players turn should they open poorly enough / should it be supported enough. Considering that we prefer consistent responses to the current format's combo decks, I would say this is a fringe consideration at best.</p> <p>-&gt; <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a>: We play trap trick so this has some advantages over Lightning Storm, which is the card this would most likely replace in the side. Not much else to say, Evenly is fantastic into Eldlich, Shaddoll, and a slew of other Decks.</p> _________  <span><strong>Elementary Combos:</strong></span> <em> Isn't BA just IP, Beatrice &amp; set 3 pass?</em> ... <em>yes, but we like to think it's more than that </em> • Tour Guide:  -&gt; Link 4 Variation: TG 1.)

I Utilized The Most Consistent Choice Of Cards And Also Situational. I Hardly Ever Have To Side Against Anything Except Backrow Heavy Decks (If Needed Otherwise 2 Of Each Epsilon And Delta). Dino Was Def A Good Pick Be That After His Cost To Tribute Gives You More Chances To Peak Out Your Opponents Interruptions, Especially If You Have More Psy Monsters In Hand. I Don't Run Multiple Copy's Of Mining Because They Proved To Be Bricks In Most Cases And I Almost Always See A Cyberse Engine Starter To Not Only Summon Lambda But To Draw A Free Card And Spin Back With Link Disciple. Upstart Goblin Is Only There To Dig. Drowning Is A Card That Hardly Anyone Expects In This Format And A Clear Field Definitely Draws In An Attack. Even Nib Plays A Role To Get Out Lambda As Well. If Your New, I Guaruntee It Wont Take Long To Learn Its Basic End Board. I Hope Whomever Plays This Build Enjoy Stopping Almost Every Play Your Opponent Can Dish Out And Hopefully To Even Improve The Deck To Becoming A Superior Competition."

If you have any suggestions, please let me know.  &nbsp;  The Phantom Knights is an archetype based around XYZ summoning, as well as banishing themselves from the graveyard to activate their effects. They also have trap monsters, but for the most part, they are not used.  Here are my card ratios and explanations:  Monsters:  3x Torn scales: The best starter in the deck. His effect is to discard a card to foolish burial a phantom knights.  Normally, you will send cloak, as cloak can banish itself from the grave to search. Torn scales also summon itself from the grave when another phantom knight is banished from the grave, making him a useful extender.  3x Ancient cloak: Ancient cloak can make one dark monster you control gain 800 atk, but that's not really important. When he's in the grave, he can banish himself to search a phantom knights card, namely boots.  3x silent boots: An extender who can special summon himself if you have a phantom knights monster, which makes this card a perfect target for searching. By banishing himself from the grave, he can search a phantom knights spell or trap, making his a useful card all around  2x ragged gloves: If he is an overlay material, the card he is equipped to gain 1000 atk. His more useful effect is to banish him from the graveyard to mill a phantom knights card, which can activate any other phantom knights graveyard effect. 3 is a little bricky, which is why I run 2.  1x: An extender that can summon itself from the hand when another phantom knight is summoned, and can banish itself to summon a phantom knight from the hand. Both of these effects can also raise a cards level by one, but that rarely comes up. One copy because it's just okay.  &nbsp;  BA engine:  3x Tour guide: a good starter, always summon graff with its effect to go into cherubini, unless graff is in your harnd, in which case you go into libic to summon graff  1x graff: send of of cherubini, or summon off of tour guide. Summon cir with his effect, unlessc cir is in hand, then ss libic to ss cir1x  1x Cir: ss off of graff, and revive cherubini  1x libic: in case you draw graff or cir  &nbsp;  Extenders:  3x kagemucha knight, 1x psychic welder, 1x psychic tracker, 1x jackalope, 1x tsuchinoko: Generic level 3 extenders to xyz or link  &nbsp;  Dragoon package:  1x red-eyes, 1x dark magician: For dragoon  &nbsp;  Hand traps  3x Ash: Generic, can be used with level 3 extenders if bricked  &nbsp;  Spells:  1x Monster reborn: Generic extender  1x Foolish burial: can mill what you need  1x reinforcement of the army: can search what you need  1x red eyes fusion: dragoon package  1x rank up magic force: Gets into your rank 5's, searchable with boots and bardiche  &nbsp;  Traps:  3x fog blade: Monster negate searchable off of boots and bardiche  1x wing: sendable off of gloves, banishes itself from the grave to ss a knight from the grave1x  1x Brigandine: Searchable trap monster, easy summon for extending  &nbsp;  Extra deck:  1x dragoon: Dragoon package, gets extra negate going first and is easy to summon because cherubini stays on board most of the time  1x dark requiem: 3 monster negates, And summon xyz monsters from the grave, best xyz monster going first.  1x Arc rebellion: Otk with raider's knight.  1x Dark rebellion: Rank up with rank up magic force into requiem.  1x raider's knight: can rank itself up into arc rebellion going second.  1x Nightmare: can disrupt opponents plays.  2x break sword: Pop a card on the field, then xyz into rank 4.  1x leviair: Extender, can ss banished monsters.  1x Borrelsword: Close out games, over accesscode because it doesn't need link monsters for its full potential.  1x unicorn: Generic rank 3  1x Rusty bardiche: Can mill a phantom knights to set a spell/trap from the deck, and can pop a card when a dark xyz is summoned to it's zone. Very useful, end on board with him as much as possible to set fogblade.  1x Cherubini: Combo wombo by milling graff, summoning cir, summoning bardiche, cir revives cherubini, use for anaconda etc.  1x verte anaconda: dragoon package  1x link spider: For brigandine  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  To show you how to play this deck, here is a 1.5 card bread an butter combo that requires scales + discard  NS scales, dicard to mill cloak  banish cloak, search boots  ss boots  link into cherubini  activate cherubini, mill graff  graff summon cir  link into bardiche  cir ss cherubini  activate bardiche, set rank up magic if first, fog blade if you want arc rebellion Otk, mill gloves  banish gloves, mill wing  activate sclaes, ss itself  banish wing, ss boots  xyz into break sword where bardiche points to  if first, pop break sword, if second, pop one card on the opponents field, then activate break swords effect to pop itself and one more card on opponents field  activate break sword, ss boots and scales as level 4s,  if you want dark requiem, xyz into dark rebellioj. If you want arc rebellion, go into raiders knight, then activate effect to go into arc  This combo ends with either3 nagates on your opponent turn when you rank up into requiem, or an easy otk plus 1 negate if they survive with arc rebellion.  I hope this guide helped! thanks for reading this far.  &nbsp;"

designed to run all three main ways players win with @ignister so that way you have multiple options to go into giving you more diversity and making it harder for opponents to stop you, you should commonly win with one of the following, accesscode, darkfluid, or arrival of cyberse.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All three have strengths and flaws so pick one accordingly!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The arrival of cyberse is powerful but it’s also hard to bring out the best version and only provides one pop a turn.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Accesscode talker is immune to effects and can pop multiple cards in one turn but it doesn’t boast the attack of the arrival.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can one card out a 4 counter darkfluid but it loses 2500 attack every time it negates something and it can only negate monsters and doesn’t destroy, plus it isn’t immune and it’s multi attack effect is very conditional.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I believe that you can make igniters very adaptable if you choose for them to be that way, there are 12 cards in

The order isn't perfect in this replay, but you get the idea.  <em><strong>Card choices:</strong></em>  <strong>Virus:</strong> This makes the deck a 43-card deck, BUT I think it fits perfectly as a finisher for the combo, you draw into it very consistently and you get hand information for your opponent  <strong>Diabolos Engine:</strong> Darkest Diabolos, Levianeer and Symphony are very good in this deck. Your opponent starts with -2 cards as well as having to fight through the other negations.

Getting out a massive Gren Maju beat stick, or resolving Inferno Tempest paired with Necroface.  Gren Maju gains 400 ATK and DEF for each of your banished cards. Golden Castle forces you to banish 10 cards each standby phase while protecting your monsters and some free bodies on the field. The Kaijus are played to not only get over problematic monsters but to also ensure that your opponent has a monster with a high enough ATK so that you can resolve Inferno Tempest by crashing one of your monsters with 0 ATK into it. That is the reason for the 0 ATK Hand traps and the Crab King.  When you resolve Inferno tempest, each Necroface that is banished will activate and force your opponent to mill 15 cards, right after Inferno Tempest banishes every monster in their deck! Once you pass your turn your opponent will most likely have 0 cards in deck and you'll win off of mill!  &nbsp;  Better Format Info Link: <a><span>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1unnQJXRb7O_Td0xpCGJ1z6r6gzUtjpc6ixhJFIM2BtI/edit#</span></a>  Join Our Discord! <a><span>https://discord.gg/TmnQWQNB</span></a>  Other ""Better Format"" Decks: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/author/frog27v/""><span>https://ygoprodeck.com/author/frog27v/</span></a>"

I think the deck is pretty much self-explanatory.  Anyways, the main idea is to OTK your opponent with  Shimmering Scraper.  To achieve that you have several tools to deal with disruptions of your opponent.  The side deck can be customized at will.  Suggestions to improve the Deck are welcome. :)  Have a nice day everyone!"
