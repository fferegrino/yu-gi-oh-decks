Well this is the de,"G'day everyone! I am back with a new deck list for everyone wanting to play a mostly pure ice barrier deck! Ice barrier since starting the game has been phenomenal to play, and i love to see people get dominated by it. Making it all the way to platinum using this deck beating out even the strongest of decks.  First off, we are going to start off with the basic strategies of this deck and move into the more complex ones.  Revealer is good. Revealer is great infact. if you get revealer on the board and it isn't negated, you have the whole deck as your oyster(pun intended(i like water decks)) Or atleast the tuners, as discarding for cost can be tricky, most of the time the best thing to do is to get the winds over the ice barrier into the graveyard to prepare for the next turn, bringing revealer back into your hand for round 2 Frost bite boogaloo. Sometimes you want to get one of your other ice barrier monsters in the grave so you can use Freezing chains of the monster reborn to quickly get it up for a combo, getting either zero dragon, White aura whale, White aura bihamut, crystal wing synchro dragon or just a plain ol' Stealth kragen.  basic two card combo is Revealer normal summoned, special summon either silent sea nettle, speaker for the ice barrier or general wayne if playing turn two and your opponent has a monster out. From there have two monsters on the field with possible outcomes being 2 level 4s or 1 level 4 and 1 level 5, you can decide what card you want to bring out with good ol' revealer's effect. Let me show you my thinking Going second and 2 or more cards on the field? and you have general wayne out? Hexa spirit of the ice barrier, use it's effect for level 2, synchro Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier out and banish those cards!  Going first? with 2 level 4s you have 3 options to go, You can use the effect of revealer bring out hexa spirit, make it level 2 using it's own effect, then summon coral dragon, with coral dragon out and a level 4 you are just one special summon away from big boy Bihumat himself! With 3300 Attack and 3000 defence, even if your opponent summons out dragoon, you can take it down with a brute force swing to it's head! Another option is to go for a Number 4: Stealth Kragen, this sets you up for a really early interrupt of your opponents plans by destroying any normal summon or pretty much anything really, non target, quick effect destroy with damage of half the attack ontop? sign me the fudgesickle up!  Now, are you going second, your revealer's effect has been interrupted, and you have a speaker for the ice barrier out, and not being locked to only summoning water monsters? Then here is the scary combo that got a lyrilusc card limited to 1. Ram your kragen into the enemy monster, summon out two spawns, with those two spawns, use them to XYZ summon into a utopic Future, then XYZ summon into Utopic Draco Future. i know right, Utopic Draco future in an Ice barrier deck?! You heard it here first! this is an amazing card and super easy to get out on your first turn!  We run the Mistar boy for a couple of reasons, when we get crackdown, and you have a stealth kragen up, you have only water monsters on the field. so link it away with a token generated by the effects of a speaker in the graveyard!  To get the crystal wing synchro dragon out is tricky. You need to be able to do it without locking yourself into water. the way to do that is to have speaker for the ice barrier and a hexa spirit. You start off by summoning the hexa spirit, then special summon the speaker, use effect of hexa spirit and send a level 3 to the grave, then synchro into gungnir, you may use the effect of gungnir if you have cards to spare, then use the freezing chains of the monster reborn, get that little hexa back out to then slap him to the grave with a fresh summon of the Crystal wing Synchro dragon!  If you are going second, and you want to mess your opponent up big time, you can! You need 3 cards with one more to discard. Revealer, Speaker and Wayne. if your oppoonent has a monster out, you can summon wayne, so Normal summon revealer, Special summon the speaker and wayne, search any spell you want from wayne, then you use the effects of Revealer. Get ou the little defender of the ice barrier or hexa spirit and discard warlock. XYZ summon Stealth Kragen with revealer and speaker. Synchro summon White aura whale with level 3 tuner and wayne, destroy their monsters in attack position and pierce the rest! You have 2 extra lives on the whale, so don't worry about him getting destroyed. Then turn after, if they haven't destroyed or they have destroyed the stealth kragen but you have 2 spawns, well guess what, you have a combo for the utpoic Draco future!  Silent sea nettle is a massive card, being able to return our defender for special summon for revealer, return the stealth kragen and spawns for a second sticky minion, and you have the ability to return any of the synchros except for crystal wing synchro dragon.  Here is the kicker. This deck sucks against a negate, not really if it stays on the field, like imperm, but if it is negated and destroyed, you have going to have a hard time getting everything back out without having a freezing chains in hand. Even then, it can be rough. I know it isn't easy, but i know you can do it, i know you can all power through!  Play around with the deck, i have tried to look at many different ways to improve it, and if you find any be sure to tell me, either message me on here, or jump into my stream Twitch.tv/Merlin_the  Thank you all for coming to my Yugi Talk"

You go second.  Also feel free to change whatever,  I'm no expert deck builder and have barely tested this  <strong>Card Choices</strong>  Jizukiru and Thunderking: Kaijus are core part to this deck's functionality.  Kaijus are not only great board breakers for this tower-building format, but they can also be used as material for Fallen of Albaz to Summon any Albaz Fusion Monster.  They can even be used with Monster Reborn to get easier OTKs.  Jizukiru and Thunderking as specifically good because they are LIGHT Monsters so they can be used as material for Albion the Branded Dragon, a Fusion Monster that just let's you summon another Fusion Monster!  Radian: Similar to Jizukiru and Thunderking but you can beat over this one and use it for material for Dragostapelia.  Albion the Shrouded Dragon: It both dumps a Albaz to the GY for your reborn spells and acts as an upstart goblin! He's also not a bad discard for albaz and can even be Summoned with Branded Bond, and used as material for Branded in White.  Pankratops: Excellent going 2nd tool for removal, can be either used as removal or extra damage for an OTK.  Thunder Dragon:  Deck thins, Provides discards for Albaz and Twin Twister, and can be used as a LIGHT material for Summoning Albion the Branded Dragon with Branded in White  Fallen of Albaz:  THE MASCOT HIMSELF <strong>ALBAZ</strong>!.  The reason for why this Deck even works is because Albaz outs large threats easily and turns them into powerful Fusion Monsters that you can use to beat your opponent to death!  Albaz is usually best paired with a kaiju so that you can guarantee a Fusion Monster.  Summoner Monk: The deck runs a fair amount of spells, especially ones that are prone to bricking so this is a great way of getting an Albaz.  Branded Bond: Great follow-up after dumping and albaz, extends/opens your OTK.  It's second effect even comes up sometimes, but it's rare.  You can float into it with Albion the Branded Dragon  Branded In White: Fantastic Extender for if you cannot Summon an Albion the Branded Dragon, and can be used to even open up situations where you cannot make a play. A good card to float into with Albion the Branded Dragon  Pot of Desires: Great consistency.  Pray that you don't banish all of your Albazes though.  Pot of Extravagance: Great consistency because Albaz targets are the only thing worth playing in this Deck's Extra Deck.  It does have some negative synergy with desires and Albion the Shrouded Dragon but you can always discard bricks.  Foolish Burial: Dumps Albaz, and sometimes maybe a big kaiju  Monster Reborn: Excellent extender, especially with all of your cards that dump Albaz in the Deck.  Harpie's Feather Duster: This Deck inherently has little answers to backrow so you want to run a good amount of backrow removal, and harpie's feather duster was the best  Twin Twister: 2nd best backrow removal, this deck has a lot of discard fuel as well  Cosmic Cyclone: 3rd best backrow removal.  Called by Grave: Negates handtraps and is very versitile, great card in almost every deck.  <strong>Extra Deck Card Choices</strong>  Predaplant Dragostapelia: He's not an Albaz Fusion but you can summon him with a Branded Albion or Branded in White.  He's great because he's basically a monster negate every turn.  Sprind the Irondash Dragon: He has some tricky materials if you don't use a kaiju specifically, but he does move and destroy cards every turn so he is pretty good if you can summon him. He floats into Albaz like most of the other Albaz Dragons.  Brigrand the Glory Dragon: Probably the least useful Fusion but he is still an Albaz Fusion.  His battle protection is pretty good but his targeting protection is pretty mid (as the kids say). He floats into Albaz like most of the other Albaz Dragons.  Titaniklad the Ash Dragon:  It's the best beater you got so you'll probably go into him often. He floats into Albaz like most of the other Albaz Dragons.  Albion the Branded Dragon: Hard to just summon with Albaz alone but he's definitely worth it.  He just allows you Summon another Fusion Monster upon being Summoned so you can get some pretty good beats going on.  He also has a unique and fantastic float effect where he adds/sets a ""Branded"" Spell/Trap from your deck (Which can be Branded in White for yet another Fusion Summon)  &nbsp;"

When I first started playing, this would have seemed ridiculous. Part of it is that the archetype got a new sweet boss monster, the Omni-Negate value-engine that tags out - part of it is the broken trap and the new broken starter - but mostly, this deck was waiting for the metagame to shift, and for players who believed in the deck to develop it.  I'm not an amazing Dragonmaid player, but I love me some Dragon decks, and I genuinely think Dragon Waifus is not just the best Dragon deck, but the best home for the Rokket package right now in the Master Duel meta. I have been working on this for a little bit, and I think I have this engine humming right now, so I wanted to share it.  The interruptions in the format are pretty standard. Maxx ""C"" is kinda nutso, and Ash answers Maxx ""C"" - Called By is also nutso even in the absence of Maxx ""C"" and if one of the few great answers to the sneaky insect. I don't love Ash tbh, but so long as it is a Maxx ""C"" meta these cards seem pretty standard and essential. After that all I'm doing is leaning on in-engine interaction and extra-deck utility monsters.  So, for Maid form Dragonmaids I'm on 7 - 3 Chamber, 3 Parlor, and 1 Nurse. Chamber and Parlor are kind of your Aleister - they both have good setups into Hieratic Seal, they both search the Fusion spell for Fusion set-ups, which is important since Sheou is the deck's main game plan. In this deck, they also can help set up Romulus plays, which is pretty rad. Chamber is mostly better than Parlor, but they're at their best when you activate both in the same turn, so the deck is built to do that. It would be nice if Kitchen also worked as a decent starter, but in practice I'd rather cut it - it doesn't have a lot of great setups, and isn't a 1-card boss monster like these other starters. Nurse, on the other hand, is kind of awesome - it'll help make the god plays possible with Foolish effects, and is summonable off of Seal for incredible value. The main value in Parlor over Chamber is sending the Dragon Form high-level monsters from the deck to the GY, but it does enable a bunch of weird set-ups. I'd love more starts into these cards, since they are my main engine, but for now that means reliance on other 2 card combo engines.  I also knew I needed high-level Dragon monsters to make Sheou with, and I wanted a good solid package of 5. 1 Absorouter makes so much sense - getting to start plays by summoning Sheou, then searching Tracer is kinda cray, and this card being in the deck also makes Tracer searchable using the Extra Deck. You also do need high-level Dragonmaids to tag out into - I like 2 Lorpar, because going second the card is extremely good, but 1 Ernus seems fine. You could put whatever you wanted in the last slot really, but I like using Chaos Dragon Levianeer going second to break board, and it'll occasionally get a snipe going first. It also is just fine as Fusion material from the hand if you can't summon it. I shifted out a Lorpar into Nurdyle, which seems good so far.  I'm running 5 Fusion Spells, but you have a lot of access to the main one with the 6 other Dragonmaids - you want to see exactly one copy of these so you don't have to search is, so again, you run 5. Dragonmaid Changeover is the best generic poly available in Dragonmaids, and in addition to its Fusion effect not being once per turn, it also can enable loopy nonsense that is both value and interruptive when you see it, so the risk of running multiples is low while the payoff of seeing a copy is huge. if you wanted to you could run Verte and 1 copy of Poly, which will mostly just be Changeover for all intents and purposes, but in testing it never came up because it was always a bad value play. You could also run Despia, Theatre of the Branded, as all of your Fusion Monsters meet the criteria for summoning, but this build runs 2 other Fields and is trying to grind with either/or. Dragon's Mirror is busted, and when things are going well the card is insane, but it is bad in multiples and the low-end Mirror makes very sad Sheous with no friends. Changeover is just the best Dragon Fusion support card in general, anyways.  So, for Rokkets, we have 2 Tracer, 1 Silverr, and 1 Magna. You can actually trigger the Magna and Silverr with Hieratic Seal or Borrelsword, which is nice, but the real reason for 2 searchable Rokkets off of Tracer is that they come up in the grind game, and that doing so enables more turn 1 Rokket combos. I'm also on 1 Quick Launch, and 1 Boot Sector Launch. This might seem weird, but remember, we only need access to 1 Tracer, and we're trying to get some more consistency in another way. I like this engine a lot, even if it isn't entirely necessary. One thing to note is that, while you can, and occasionally should, pop your own field spell with Tracer, it is often better just to leave it up for the threat of the grind game, whichever one you've ended on.  So, the main consistency for all of these combos comes with the weird little thing we're doing with the rest of the deck. Foolish Burial and Dragon Shrine are effectively copies of the same card you can activate on the same turn in this deck, and Ravine gives us a searchable third copy, with the downside/occasional upside of coming with a discard, and being easily searchable. Meanwhile, Nurse Dragonmaid revives Dragonmaids sent to the GY for value, Hospitality does the same but with a free send often attached, and Monster Reborn is a hyper generic card that also allows access to the dragons sent off the sending package, as does World Legacy Guardragon, at least for the purposes of summoning Rokkets and low-level Maids.  Lastly, we have 3 Tidying. We're really leaning on these and on the weird activation cost of Hieratic Seal to out floodgates and give us game against dump floodgate decks - we also need a lot of this card, since it'll be sent to the GY to enable the extension of plays, and since it is a stupid busted trap and a big part of the decks viability. It's the dumb trap you search out, but since often enough you'll have to search out a Fusion spell, you want to see this anyways.  This deck can put up pretty insane boards - Sheou + Seal is still your bread and butter, but you'll add a Savage to that often enough. Many hands get to choose between Sheou + Savage and Sheou + Seal. Some get to choose between Sheou or Savage + Seal. You'll also sometimes make God boards.

As the name suggests, the deck focuses around the field spell <a data-name=""Wetlands"">Wetlands</a>, a card that is rather specific as conditions are concerned, but the attack boost it provides is extremely substantial. The ability to turn any 0/0 into a 1200/0 is a big game changer. there aren't many ways to search it out so terraforming and metaverse will just have to do. 5 copies of a card is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not as consistent as something like Umi Goodstuff. (i'm working on a list for that so keep an eye out) This deck also centers around a few other cards. The aquarium spells are important as they do multiple different things, 1: they provide an additional stat boost. 2: they provide some protection for your monsters. and 3: they provide a little recursion when destroyed. along with those cards, <a data-name=""Cryomancer"">Cryomancer</a> and <a data-name=""Dewdark of the ice barrier"">Dewdark of the ice barrier</a> are both pretty strong cards for the deck, Cryomancer being a walking gravity bind, and Dewdark just attacking directly for big damage if you have wetlands on board. all of the other cards in the deck aren't as important but they do serve a purpose, most of them are pretty obvious. Now go on out there and beat people to death with the fabled <a data-name=""M I S T A R  B O Y"">M I S T A R  B O Y</a>"

Although only 2 cards were ever printed on the archetype in the TCG/OCG, I was able to build this deck revolving around its concept about Attributes with another archetype which is.. <strong>Shaddolls!</strong> They work surprisingly well with each other <strong>maybe not top tier, but it is usable and fun</strong>. It's probably the closest thing that you'll ever get to be playing the Anime version of this deck until support cards come out. Your main focus is to <strong>have your </strong>Field Spell<strong> Clear World</strong>&nbsp;&amp; go into your <strong>Aces</strong>, using<strong> ""Shaddoll Fusion""</strong> summoning ""<strong><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda</a></strong>"" (<strong>sending a Shaddoll monster and ""Clear Vice Dragon"" to the GY since it is a DARK monster</strong>) which will <strong>restrict Special Summons</strong> and either <strong>Special or Tribute Summon</strong> <strong>CVD </strong>while <strong>Clear World</strong> is keeping <strong>you and your monsters safe</strong> <strong>by battle</strong>. <strong>Winda provides a great field presence</strong> with<strong> its own immunity </strong>to destruction effects, but not without its low stats keeping it in check. So it <strong>may have a hard time</strong> attacking, being attacked or doing a lot of dmg, that is why you<strong> have CVD,</strong> they make <strong>a great duo partner </strong>with each other,<strong> Clear Vice Dragon</strong> may look weak, <strong>but</strong> here's the thing, <strong>all of its effect are continous &amp; do not start a chain</strong>, it has its own <strong>Unique</strong> protection effect of destruction <strong>(which is not a cost by the way)</strong> and it does all the battling for <strong>Winda</strong> beating over your opponent's <strong>Beefy High ATK</strong> <strong>Boss monsters, when You Attack</strong> <strong>it gains Double the ATK of that monster (During Dmg Calculation Only)</strong>. It can <strong>beat almost any monster</strong> by battling such as; <strong>""Number S39: Utopia the Lightning"", ""Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon"", ""Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax"", ""Raidraptor Ultimate Falcon"", ""Black Wing Full Armored Master"", and etc</strong>..<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A pretty neet monster <strong>althought</strong>, <strong>it's not OP and is still vulnarble</strong>, but it <strong>gets the job done</strong> <strong>when needed</strong>. Using the Trap card <strong>DNA Transplant</strong> with your Field Spell or <strong>Super Poly</strong> are great going for the <strong>DARK</strong> Attribute since it has more of a field presence than the <strong>other attributes</strong>, <strong>although yes you won't be able to Attack, </strong>that is why<strong> </strong>it is<strong> important </strong>to bring out<strong> CVD as SOON </strong>as <strong>possible</strong> since<strong> You as the player are ""Unnaffected by the effects of Clear World"" OR </strong>you can<strong> just set another Clear World to avoid the detrimental effects in your turn </strong>then activate it once again when you're done battling<strong> (A alternative win condition</strong> could also be done with the Trap card <strong>DNA Transplant </strong>by declaring the <strong>FIRE Attribute,</strong> <strong>If</strong> it comes down to finishing off your opponent when you can't Attack for game just simply <strong>burn them for 1000 Dmg</strong>, <strong>only activate it During you opponent's End Phase for Clear World to trigger the element of surprise on them)</strong>. Using the Spell card ""<strong>Super Polymerization""</strong>, can also help remove almost any of your opponents problematic monsters along the way. For duels <strong>going up against a pure DARK Attributed monsters</strong>, you may <strong>side deck DNA for more useful cards</strong> that you may need for the duel, they'll be bricks because <strong>you'll be going for the DARK Attribute 99% of the time anyways for those non DARK decks</strong>. <strong>If you liked</strong> the Deck Profile, <strong>Please leave a Like &amp; Comment</strong>. Also <strong>check out my Youtube video</strong> that I posted of <strong>this deck down below</strong>!

If you're going second, not only do you have 9 hand traps, but also 2 Cosmic Cyclones and Harpie's Feather Duster.  &nbsp;  I decided to name this deck ""Iwaki Fossil Park"" after the Iwaki Coal Mine and Fossil Museum, located in Iwaki, Japan. This facility features a replica of a coal mine and educates tourists on Iwaki's history of coal mining, and has a beautiful and extensive array of dinosaur skeletons and fossils! So if you're interested in the mining industry, or you're a bit of a dino nerd, then you're really gonna get a kick out of the place. Currently, Japan has not yet opened its borders to tourists, but hopefully that will change soon."

If you know how a banish deck works, you know how this deck works. Just read over the effects of cards you're not sure of. Also keep in mind that you want to go second with this deck since it's an OTK deck and not a negate deck. The only First Turn Play that's super useful is summoning Draglubion and than using Draglubion's effect to summon Hope Harbinger, since that negates one spell card.  A few notes to keep it easier if you are not familiar with some of these cards ( I sure as hell wasn't)  Gigarays Gandora:  You want one of this card in the Graveyard and one other Gandora in the graveyard when you summon this card, you than banish literally everything on the field and can directly attack your opponent with like 10,000 atk.  Gizmek Makami:  When this monster is normal or special summoned, you can discard one card and search for any of your boss monsters (Gizmek Orochi, Gigarays Gandora and Gren Maju). You can also normal summon this card if you have at least 10 cards banished. This is probably your best deck search and draw power, though the utility of Allure of Darkness and Pot of Desires is not lost on me.  At the end of the day this deck has 3 win conditions <ol>  	<li>Gigarays Gandora banishing everything but itself on both fields and hitting ridiculously hard</li>  	<li>Gren Maju hitting ridiculously hard</li>  	<li>Getting two 8 star monsters on the field, summoning Draglubion and using its effect to summoning Numeron Dragon to hit... ridiculously hard</li> </ol>"

The goal is summon DAD or <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Armed_Dragon"">Dark Armed Dragon</a>. If you don't know this card it is an older meta staple being one of the only Teir 0 decks in the game (not being played with Armed Dragons).  This is a fun card that sort of murders your opponent if they have no negates with an accesscode type effect for DARK monsters.  If you don't like Danger! Dark world I suggest you play some of these engines or even all of them: <ul>  	<li>Phantom Knights</li>  	<li>Burning Abyss</li>  	<li>Destiny Hero &amp;/or the DPE engine</li>  	<li>Shaddolls</li>  	<li>Bamboo Sword (a drawing engine using Equip Spells)</li>  	<li>Raidraptor</li>  	<li>Maybe even blackwings</li>  	<li>Brave/Adventurer (note: it doesn't use DARK monsters)</li>  	<li>Chaos</li>  	<li>Zombies</li>  	<li>Lair of Darkness</li>  	<li>Resonators (Maybe even use the Red Dragon Archfiend Ghost Rare as well)</li>  	<li><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gren_Maju_Da_Eiza"">Gren Maju</a> type deck with cards like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Gizmek_Orochi,_the_Serpentron_Sky_Slasher"">Gizmek Orochi</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Eater_of_Millions"">Eater of Millions</a>.</li>  	<li>Red-Eyes</li>  	<li>Dark Magician (Maybe Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon)</li>  	<li>Thunder Dragon</li> </ul> Of course you can make the deck your own by making it  mix between the engines or some not mentioned too.  I chose Danger!s because they are a great monster draw engine consiting of DARK monsters and Dark Worlds for even more draws, PLUS they totally break boards using Grapha and Bigfoot then lastly you can summon DAD to clean up the rest of the board!  And lastly for Side deck I suggest running <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Danger!_Thunderbird!"">Danger! Thunderbird</a> not included in the deck list because I wanted to keep it at 40. Run kaijus probably so you can out the negates to stop your DAD board wipe and probably <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_Storm"">Lightning Storm</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Harpie%27s_Feather_Duster"">Feather Duster</a>.

Lab Archfiend is def the monster to get on board, it gains attack for each named trap in your GY. Easily becomes a wall, with a sizable booty to boot. Pairing this with the </span><span><a data-name=""Lord of the Heavenly Prison"">Lord of the Heavenly Prison</a></span><span>card allows you to successfully accomplish the whole deck.</span>"

The deck strategy remains focused on its win condition through the ""Towers"" called <a data-name=""The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister"">The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</a> and for that the main deck and extra deck have an excellent synergy to do it with a <strong>1 card combo engine</strong>.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>The changes I made to the main deck were:</strong>  Two <a data-name=""Doyon @Ignister"">Doyon @Ignister</a> makes a lot of sense in the deck as it is the fundamental piece that allows you to make 1 Card Combo while maintaining good follow ups in the process. It is a good card to have in your starting hand and <strong>increases the consistency</strong> of the deck overall.  The use of <a data-name=""Hiyari @Ignister"">Hiyari @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Gatchiri @Ignister"">Gatchiri @Ignister</a> makes you able to play around <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a>, the only detail is that this is only possible in <strong>2 Card Combo</strong> because the only way to add Hiyari to the hand is through <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> or a <a data-name=""Cynet Mining"">Cynet Mining</a> and for that we should previously have a way to add the main combo pieces to the hand.  I also think it's very important to have as many copies of Field Spell <a data-name=""Ignister A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I.Land</a> as possible because without it your <strong>plays are limited</strong> depending on having extenders like <a data-name=""Gathiri"">Gathiri</a> or <a data-name=""Hiyari"">Hiyari</a> to get somewhere and if your opponent is smart against @Ignister he will keep hand traps like <a data-name=""Ash Blossom"">Ash Blossom</a> and <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> for the <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> and <a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> preventing you from accessing the field. And the higher the stat of having 2 field Spells in your hand, the easier it is to use <a data-name=""A.I. Contact"">A.I. Contact</a> which is an excellent consistency card.  As for the Extra Deck I chose to use <a data-name=""Update Jammer"">Update Jammer</a> instead of <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> but many players like to keep <a data-name=""Linguriboh"">Linguriboh</a> to have better chances against <strong>Floodgates</strong> and end up taking <a data-name=""Light Dragon @Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> from the decklist. I prefer to keep XYZ in the extra deck because it gives you the option to have <strong>one more target</strong> for the <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> and it's a great card for the deck <strong>grind game</strong> because it doesn't matter how fast matches are in modern yugioh because there are decks competent enough to get you into a <strong>resource trading game</strong> and <a data-name=""Light Dragon @Ignister"">Light Dragon @Ignister</a> will help you out a lot in these moments for being <strong>interaction</strong> with the opponent, <strong>protection</strong> of your monsters against destruction by effects and still <strong>helps to give OTK</strong> for giving Reborn of a LINK monster in the Battle Phase.  About <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> my view on the card has changed a lot because before I thought <a data-name=""Decode Talker Heatsoul"">Decode Talker Heatsoul</a> was a much better card to use as a target for <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> for having an excellent field effect that serves as a <strong>contingency plan</strong> in case your plays are stopped if you <strong>draw 1 card every turn</strong>. But <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix @Ignister"">Fire Phoenix @Ignister</a> has very interesting applications in the deck: synergy with <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> in the Battle Phase to <strong>destroy an opponent's monster</strong>, it also <strong>inflicts 2300 effect damage</strong> to the opponent, has <strong>floating effect</strong> to return to the field if destroyed by effect of cards or battle. So in many situations it will be this card that will <strong>force interactions</strong> of the opponent's boss monsters like <a data-name=""AA-ZEUS"">AA-ZEUS</a> and in the near future the <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> than a Heatsoul.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Combos:</strong>  Differences between each Starter is basically in the <strong>first half of the combo</strong> which I say is how you arrive at the following gamestate: <a data-name=""Splash Mage"">Splash Mage</a> + <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> + <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a>/<a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a> = <a data-name=""Achichi"">Achichi</a>/<a data-name=""Pikari"">Pikari</a>/<a data-name=""A. I. Meet You"">A. I. Meet You</a> always end up arriving at this part of the combo and from then on it will be the same for everyone what to do next to get to TOWERS.

Meet You</a> or <a data-name=""A.I.dle Reborn"">A.I.dle Reborn</a> for the combo to come out right, something you learn with practice)  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /////// <strong>Combo 6: 1 Card Combo (Bomber Dragon Double Raigeki)</strong>  replay?id=621416-35838685 Gamestate: Bomber Dragon + Light Dragon + Dark Infant + Field + A. I.

I'm just showing you that it's possible to <strong>make other end boards in turn 1</strong> if you want to test it.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Many games are decided on the details of some archetype cards</strong> that have very useful side effects and that the <strong>opponent doesn't pay enough attention to</strong>:  <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> has the GY effect of banishing and destroying a Cyberse monster that is <strong>battling during the Damage Step</strong>, with this you <strong>avoid taking Battle Damage and survive a possible OTK</strong> from the opponent <strong>surprising him</strong> by winning another turn. In Master Duel this has happened to me twice: The first against a <strong>Numeron</strong> that summoned 4 monsters and thought it would OTK but couldn't. The second against a <strong>Zoodiac Tri-Brigade</strong> that did <a data-name=""Accesscode"">Accesscode</a> + <a data-name=""Shuraig"">Shuraig</a> in just 4 summons and left the LINK-1 <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> on the field because it already had lethal and wanted to play around <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> but in the Battle Phase I used <a data-name=""Achichi"">Achichi</a> eff avoiding the OTK surviving the turn.  <a data-name=""Pikari @Ignister"">Pikari @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Hiyari @Ignister"">Hiyari @Ignister</a> <strong>manipulate levels to 4</strong> until the end of the turn, with Piraki from any other @Ignister Monster like <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> and Hiyari being his own level <strong>allowing you to make RANK-4 plays</strong>.  <a data-name=""Gatchiri"">Gatchiri</a> has a <strong>continuous effect on the field to protect Cyberse monsters</strong> from being destroyed by card effects the <strong>first time each turn</strong>. It doesn't exist in Master Duel, but in the near future <a data-name=""Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer</a> (DPE) will come to the game so much that in the game banlist they already put <a data-name=""Fusion Destiny"">Fusion Destiny</a> at 2 thinking about this boss monster. This means you'll see much better with the <strong>in-game DPE how useful it is</strong> to take advantage of this <strong>Gatchiri protection</strong> while playing @Ignister which is another detail people forget about in the deck.  <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> can be made using <strong>any @Ignister other than LINK</strong> Monster. So you can use a <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus"">Wind Pegasus</a> or <a data-name=""Light Dragon"">Light Dragon</a> as material which is useful when you want to <strong>clear the Main Monster Zone</strong> and use the <a data-name=""Ignister A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I.Land</a> eff or to trigger <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> eff from <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>.  Speaking of <a data-name=""Dark Templar @Ignister"">Dark Templar @Ignister</a> you can use your <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a> effect <strong>during the Damage Step</strong> so a peculiar way to play around <a data-name=""Nibiru"">Nibiru</a> is you Summon 3 Monsters to the field, make the <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> and go to Battle Phase to <strong>attack and destroy an opponent's monster</strong> and trigger eff of Monster Reborn from the Dark Templar and then when you summon an arrow he points you <strong>bring 2 more @Ignister</strong> to <strong>start your Main Phase 2</strong> making <a data-name=""The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister"">The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister</a>. <a data-name=""Nibiru, the Primal Being"">Nibiru, the Primal Being</a> counts the summons made in <strong>all phases of the turn</strong>: Draw Phase, Standby Phase, Main Phase and Battle Phase but it can only use its effect <strong>during the Main Phase</strong> and as you have <strong>Turn Player Priority</strong> you start your Main Phase 2 making Towers playing around Nibiru.  Sometimes the <a data-name=""Danmari @Ignister"">Danmari @Ignister</a> hand effect can help you deal with <strong>floodgates</strong>. Once I was playing against <a data-name=""Eldlich"">Eldlich</a> and my opponent flip <a data-name=""Gozen Match"">Gozen Match</a> on <a data-name=""Dark Infant @Ignister"">Dark Infant @Ignister</a> summon, as I already had <a data-name=""Doyon @Ignister"">Doyon @Ignister</a> in hand I used <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> to add <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> to the hand and then I LINK summon ladder to <a data-name=""Cyberse Wicckid"">Cyberse Wicckid</a> and bring <a data-name=""Doyon"">Doyon</a> back to the field with <a data-name=""A.I.dle Reborn"">A.I.dle Reborn</a> and in the Battle Phase I attacked <a data-name=""Eldlich the Golden Lord"">Eldlich the Golden Lord</a> and negated the attack with the <a data-name=""Danmari"">Danmari</a> effect just for him to enter the field and in Main Phase 2 to <a data-name=""Accesscode Talker"">Accesscode Talker</a> and destroy the Gozen Match.  <a data-name=""Gatchiri @Ignister"">Gatchiri @Ignister</a> only enters the field when <strong>targeting a Cyberse Monster and negating its effects</strong>, if the Cyberse monster's effects are <strong>already negated</strong> you <strong>won't even be able to activate Gatchiri</strong>'s effect to enter the field, so in case you have for example the <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> on the field and would use it to make the <a data-name=""Dark Infant @Ignister"">Dark Infant @Ignister</a> to add the Field Spell and the opponent has a set <a data-name=""Infinite Impermanence"">Infinite Impermanence</a> saved to use in the <a data-name=""Dark Infant"">Dark Infant</a> effect because he knows it's much more important to prevent adding the Field Spell than a monster for the hand, thinking about this possibility of the <strong>Dark Infant being denied</strong> the best thing for you to do is use the <strong>effect of Gatchiri on Achichi</strong> to enter the field because if the Dark Infant has the effects negated you will lose the chance to bring in Gatchiri and continue to have plays on the turn.  <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> only <strong>adds Level 4 or lower @Ignister</strong> monsters to the hand just like <a data-name=""Dark Templar"">Dark Templar</a> only <a data-name=""Soul Charge"">Soul Charge</a>s <strong>Level 4 or lower GY monsters</strong>. The only ways to <strong>add Level 5 or higher @Ignister</strong> to the hand is when using <a data-name=""Hiyari @Ignister"">Hiyari @Ignister</a> eff or <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a>.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<strong>Cards that have GY effects important to remember</strong>:  As previously emphasized we have the effect of <a data-name=""Achichi @Ignister"">Achichi @Ignister</a> on <strong>Damage Step</strong> and <a data-name=""Fire Phoenix"">Fire Phoenix</a> <strong>Floating eff</strong> on the next Standby Phase, we also have the most obvious effects that are the ones that no one forgets <a data-name=""Wind Pegasus @Ignister"">Wind Pegasus @Ignister</a> and <a data-name=""Danmari @Ignister"">Danmari @Ignister</a> that interact with the opponent and the <a data-name=""Ignister A.I.Land"">Ignister A.I.Land</a> to set back on the field.  But the effects that are most overlooked are those of the <strong>deck's Reborn Spells</strong> - <a data-name=""A.I.dle Reborn"">A.I.dle Reborn</a> and <a data-name=""FA.I.ghting Spirit"">FA.I.ghting Spirit</a>. The quick play spell <a data-name=""A.I.dle Reborn"">A.I.dle Reborn</a> allows you when an <strong>attack is declared involving 2 monsters</strong> you banish it and a card from your hand to <strong>add an ""A.I."" Spell/Trap in the GY or banished</strong> to the hand. This is very important to remember with regards to adding an <a data-name=""A.I. Land"">A.I. Land</a> that was banned with <a data-name=""Cosmic Cyclone"">Cosmic Cyclone</a> back in hand or an <a data-name=""A.I. Meet You"">A.I. Meet You</a> who is in the GY during your opponent's turn and you don't have Follow Ups for your next turn, so it's <strong>another unexpected way to take advantage of these details</strong> of the various cards of @Ignister's archetype while your opponent doesn't even realize that <strong>when attacking your monsters is giving you a Follow Up</strong>.  The <a data-name=""FA.I.ghting Spirit"">FA.I.ghting Spirit</a> banishes itself to protect its @Ignister of 23atk+ ATK from <strong>destruction by effects</strong>. And on top of that <strong>when being banned</strong> she activates her other effect of protecting your @Ignister from 23atk or more ATK from <strong>destruction per battle</strong> so there are <strong>several details that make the difference between winning and losing games with @Ignister</strong>.  //////////////////////////////////////////////// /////// <strong>Disregard the Side Deck</strong> because it doesn't exist in Master Duel, I'm just showing other examples of tech cards that can be used in the main deck in place of some of the 15 spaces available in the main deck.  &nbsp;"

I removed my second Chaos Ruler for a Samsara, because sometimes you need a level 5 Synchro Dark Dragon Monster to combo off and also I am playing currently 3x Resonator Command which pairs well with 11 Resonators, so you always get Crimson Resonator. Also I am playing 2x Red Reign, this card plus a level 8 or higher Dark Dragon Synchro Monster is almost an instant win against most decks.  For the spicy tech I am playing 1x Armageddon Knight, because this card plus Red Resonator is still access to Crimson Resonator.

If you're going first you want to set up for the next turn and try to set up some disruption so you do not get OTK'D Yourself. So how do we do this?  First try going into Number 90. This will put a boss monster that is hard to deal with shy of kaiju that can set up for next turn with its search effect and also negate a monster effect your opponent uses for the turn. if you have a good enough hand to set up two boss monsters you can also try going into cyber dragon infinity which will provide an omni negate but if you do not have the galaxy soliders to do so we can settle for hope harbinger. This will leave you with a monster negate and spell negate which is still annoying to deal with.  Now for the OTK its simple its all about number 62.

Despite OCG and TCG being different formats, this particular archetype should be really successful in our format too.  The deck should be consistent, since Splight monsters special summon themselves when you control another level 2 monster card, thus easily allowing the start of your combo. The usual endboard is Toadally Awesome and Splight Elf for two Spell/Trap negates. You should use the Toad first and then revive him (providing that your opponent summons a monster) with Splight Elf's effect. Other notable cards for your endboard are Splight Red and Splight Carrot who provide monster and spell/trap negation respectively.  I should also note that the effect of Gigantic Splight effectively blocks your opponent from using Nibiru thanks to it's second effect"

Presenting, Branded Tearalaments.</span>  <strong><span>""Why play this deck?""</span></strong>  <span>Well... I love Fusion Summoning, and I love Fusion Summoning more than once. What's actually funny about this list is that since I've decided to cut the <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">DPE </a>engine, I can now play <a data-name=""Visas Starfrost"">Visas Starfrost</a>, which means there's a line in this list that can bring out <a data-name=""Baronne De Fleur"">Baronne De Fleur</a> before your fifth summon, though it kills your <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> but you know what, that's fine, because after months of endless testing Branded lists, the archetypal Field Spell <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> is pretty underrated. That also means you could search for any ""Branded"" Spell/Trap instead of rushing into Branded Fusion, you still have your Tearalaments cards that can do your Fusion Summoning for you by recycling the materials from your hand, field, and/or GY back into the Deck, and that Fusion Summon is not Level restricted, that means that if you have a bunch of DARK Fairies in your GY, you can actually still bring <a data-name=""The First Darklord"">The First Darklord</a> this way. As fast as the Branded engine is in terms of spending all your resources from the deck, the Tearalaments cards bring that ever so needed recycling power at a cost of sacrificing some of your GY set up. Anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span>I've already explained my standard ratio for the Branded engine before, but as a refresher, here it is:</span>  <span>• x2 <a data-name=""Aluber Jester of Despia"">Aluber</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>, &amp; x1 <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia</a>, <a data-name=""Ad Libitum of Despia"">Ad Libitum</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a> for monsters.</span> <span>• x3 <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a>, &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Despia, Theater of the Branded"">Despia, Theater of the Branded</a> with/without x1 <a data-name=""Branded In Red"">Branded In Red</a> for the Spells, depending on whether you want to use <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> or not for the spells.</span> <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> with/without x2-3 <a data-name=""Branded Retribution"">Branded Retribution</a> for traps.</span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span><strong>• The Tearalaments cards</strong> - <span>The only cards that I feel like needs to be discussed, especially in terms of ratio.</span></span> <ol>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Rainoheart&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Rainoheart</strong></a> - <span>This is your other Normal Summon, just following the standard rule of 5 per deck. He sends any copy of ""Tearalaments"" monster from your deck, except a copy of himself. He also has an effect to summon himself when sent to the GY by a card effect but banishes when removed from the field.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Shaylen&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Shaylen</strong></a> - <span>The main extender of the Tearalaments, has an effect to Special Summon herself from your hand and allows you to send a monster from your hand to the GY and mill 3 cards off the top of your deck. This is all a part of the effect, which means it can trigger your Despian Tragedy's search effect. She also has the archetypal effect that she shares with the following other 2 Tearalaments monsters, to Fusion Summon ANY Fusion Monster when sent to the GY by a card effect, by shuffling the Fusion Materials from your hand, field, and/or GY into the deck. We only play 2 of her because she can easily be milled anyway.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Haufenis&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Haufenis</strong></a> - <span>The obligatory pseudo-hand trap of the archetype, has an effect that can be activated in response to an opponent's monster effect activated on the field that allows herself to be Special Summoned from your hand and mills 3 cards off the top of your deck, alongside her GY effect to Fusion Summon. We only play 1 of her for the same reason as Shaylen's.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><a data-name=""&lt;strong&gt;Tearalaments Meiru&lt;/strong&gt;""><strong>Tearalaments Meiru</strong></a> - <span>The other archetypal Normal Summon, except we're playing less copies of her and just more of Rainoheart instead because he's a name for the purposes of Fusion Summoning despite both being very much searchable. Has the effect to also mill 3 cards off the top of your deck when she's either Normal or Special Summoned, alongside her GY effect to Fusion Summon. We also only play 1 of her for the same reason as her sisters'.</span></span></li> </ol> <span>No Tearalaments Spell(s) because they don't have anything so far that helps with this particular version of the build.</span>  <span><strong>Traps</strong></span>  <span><strong>• x3 <a data-name=""Tearalaments Crime"">Tearalaments Crime</a></strong> - <span>The obligatory archetypal omni-negate Counter Trap that can be activated if you control either a ""Tearalaments"" monster or a ""Visas Starfrost"". It negates the activation, but it shuffles the card back to the deck instead, then allows you to send a card from your hand to the GY (potentially a ""Tearalaments"" monster, Despian Tragedy, or any one of brick that needs to be in the GY.)</span></span>  <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span>• x1 <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kaleido Heart"">Tearalaments Kaleido Heart</a> &amp; x2 <a data-name=""Tearalaments Kitkalos"">Tearalaments Kitkalos</a></span> <ol>  	<li><span>Kitkalos is a Level 5 Fusion Monster that requires only 1 ""Tearalaments"" monster and an Aqua monster, and has three effects. The first is her being a pseudo-searcher upon getting Special Summoned (not just Fusion Summoned). Second is the effect that allows you to Special Summon a ""Tearalaments"" monster from your hand or GY by sending a monster you control to the GY (which can include herself). Lastly, if she's sent to the GY by a card effect, you can mill 5 cards off the top of your deck. Each of these three are hard once per turn effects.</span></li>  	<li><span>Kaleidoheart is the current boss monster of the Tearalaments, that requires 2 Aqua monsters and Tearalaments Rainoheart in particular, in which we only play 1 of because he's extremely recyclable due to us also playing the Branded engine. He cannot be used as Fusion Material, so that's neat against Mirror Matches. He has the effect that allows you to, upon him or another Aqua-type monster getting Special Summoned while he's on the field, target a card your opponent controls and shuffle it to the deck. If he's sent to the GY by a card effect, he can also Special Summon himself back and lets you send a ""Tearalaments"" card from your Deck to the GY. Both of his effects are all hard once per turns.</span></li> </ol> <strong><span>Final Thoughts:</span></strong>  <span>The first time I've read the Tearalaments cards I've immediately told myself, ""If these cards' effects for a Fusion based archetype don't scream ""we're definitely eventually going to receive a Shaddoll Fusion of our own"", I don't know what does"". Like, it's crazy that compared to the former lore-based archetype, Despias weren't as good initially, but Tearalaments... they only need an extremely good pay off and a consistent enabler, possibly in a form of a Fusion Spell, and trust that I will always be keeping an eye on this archetype with consistent and careful watch because I am extremely excited for this, so much so that it reminds me of the day Despias were initially released. As per usual, if you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to express them down in the comments and I'll respond to them as soon as I possibly can.</span>"

It's actually a pretty fun control deck to play.","<span>Hi, Grayewick the Fusionist here, back after two or more days without internet so I was stuck trying to build this list that is actually pretty confusing to make (either that or the other half of this deck just gave me a choice paralysis due to how many one of cards it runs originally), which is Branded Dark Magicians... Branded Magicians sounds cooler.</span>  <span><strong>""Why play this deck?""</strong></span>  <span>Are you a Yugiboomer? Do you love Fusion Summoning, like me? Or do you just... want to have a valid excuse to use <a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a> over <a data-name=""Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer"">DPE</a>? Well this deck (I think) is for you, kind of. Also a bit of a disclaimer, as per usual, <strong>my lists are tinkered based off of my preferences</strong>, so if you feel like changing something about the deck, feel free to do so, so long as it doesn't mean using the Brave Tokens in a deck that needs its Normal Summon, <strong>especially this one</strong>. Anyway, the list.</span>  <span><strong>The Main Deck:</strong></span>  <span><strong>Monsters</strong></span>  <span>• <strong>My standard Branded engine ratio, with a few changes</strong> - <span>x2 <a data-name=""Aluber the Jester of Despia"">Aluber the Jester of Despia</a>, x1 <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a>, <a data-name=""Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous"">Incredible Ecclesia</a>, &amp; <a data-name=""Dramaturge of Despia"">Dramaturge</a> for the monsters. x3 <a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion</a> &amp; <a data-name=""Branded Opening"">Branded Opening</a> with/without x1 <a data-name=""Branded In Red"">Branded In Red</a> for the Spells, depending on whether you want to use <a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a> or not. x1 <a data-name=""Branded Exile"">Branded Exile</a> with/without x2 <a data-name=""Branded Retribution"">Branded Retribution</a> for the Traps. Only one Fallen of Albaz this time mainly only to make room. I really tried my hardest to make this as compact as possible without cutting Branded Fusion to 1.</span></span>  <span>• <strong>The Dark Magician cards</strong></span> <ol>  	<li><span>The <strong><a data-name=""Dark Magician"">Dark Magician</a></strong>s, not the Fusion but the Yugi's ace monster (kind of) - <span>We only play 2 because it's a brick and it's a target for both Magicians' Souls and Branded Fusion. The other one is a <a data-name=""The LIGHT - Hex-Sealed Fusion"">The LIGHT - Hex-Sealed Fusion</a>, hence the ""kind of"".</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Apprentice Illusion Magician"">Apprentice Illusion Magician</a></strong> - <span>Dark Magician searcher. Only a 2 of because that's really the standard ratio for it and I don't want to play just one copy of any searcher, like playing only one copy of Despian Tragedy in Branded Despia, for example. I'm just saying that it doesn't make sense.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magician's Rod"">Magician's Rod</a></strong> - <span>Normal Summon Rod, add Illusion Magic, Dark Magical Circle, or Eternal Soul, or anything else you wanna do instead.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Souls"">Magicians' Souls</a></strong> - <span>Probably the most broken (and expensive) card in this deck, aside from Branded Fusion. It can either set up your GY or Special Summon a Dark Magician from your GY (and technically from your Deck), and it draws you cards.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Illusion of Chaos"">Illusion of Chaos</a></strong> - <span>Reveal this card, add Magicians' Souls or Magician's Rod. Also a Fusion Material for <a data-name=""Master of Chaos"">Master of Chaos</a>.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Eye of Timaeus"">Eye of Timaeus</a></strong> - <span>A searchable Dark Magician Fusion monster because that's what it practically is, usually Dark Magician/Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight or The Dark Magicians.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Dark Magic Attack"">Dark Magic Attack</a></strong> - A searchable b<span>ack row removal. This could also be <a data-name=""Dark Burning Magic"">Dark Burning Magic</a> if you just want to wipe your opponent's entire board instead.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Bond Between Teacher and Student"">Bond Between Teacher and Student</a></strong> - <span>A free <a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl"">Dark Magician Girl</a> and Dark Magic Attack/Dark Burning Magic.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Secrets of Dark Magic"">Secrets of Dark Magic</a></strong> - <span>The original Magikey Maftea, it's both a Fusion Spell and a Ritual Spell, except it's also a Quick-Play Spell.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Illusion Magic"">Illusion Magic</a></strong> - <span>Another searchable one of searcher.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Dark Magical Circle"">Dark Magical Circle</a></strong> - <span>Your most important card. It's a search (sort of) upon activation, and it's an interruption in the form of a targeting (boo) banishing effect (yay) triggered when a ""Dark Magician"" (that counts your Fusion Monsters that are treated as such as well) is Summoned to your field. Searchers should always be played at maximum quantities, especially this one, though you could get away with playing 2 since it itself is also searchable, I guess.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magician Navigation"">Magician Navigation</a></strong> - <span>This one feels weird, because in Pure Dark Magicians, you gotta play at least 2-3 copies of this but in this version, it feels weak and strangely enough it feels stronger with its interruption effect when in the GY. I'll leave this one up to you but just one of this, I feel I can get by.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Eternal Soul"">Eternal Soul</a></strong> - <span>Your second most important card. The reason why your Dark Magical Circle can spam banish effects. Also, protect this card <strong>at all costs</strong>, because it's gonna blow up your entire board when your opponent gets rid of it.</span></span></li>  	<li><span><strong><a data-name=""Magicians' Combination"">Magicians' Combination</a></strong> - <span>It's a negate, except it's actually pretty fun to use, since it lets you tag in and out of your Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl. Also, it negates the effect, not the activation so... keep that in mind because it's relevant.</span></span></li> </ol> <span><strong>The Extra Deck:</strong></span>  <span>• <strong><a data-name=""Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon"">Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon</a></strong> - <span>The big boss monster towers negate, but this time it can actually pop monsters and burn.</span></span>  <span>• <strong><a data-name=""Dark Magician the Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician the Dragon Knight</a></strong> - <span>Your second boss monster, mainly because it protects your back row from targeting and destruction. I like to play 2 for insurance but you can probably get away with just playing 1.</span></span>  <span>• <strong><a data-name=""Master of Chaos"">Master of Chaos</a></strong> - <span>This one's purely experimental, I never actually see this come up to be honest, but because I'm playing Illusion of Chaos, might as well use it.</span></span>  <span>• <strong><a data-name=""The Dark Magicians"">The Dark Magicians</a></strong> - <span>A neat one of monster that draws you a card whenever a Spell/Trap is activated, be it by you or your opponent. It also floats into both Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl so, that's cool I guess.</span></span>  <span>• <strong><a data-name=""Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight"">Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight</a></strong> - <span>Quick-Play pop on a face-up card at a cost of a discard might sound hefty at times, but better have it than not.</span></span>  <span><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></span>  <span>It's a fun deck to play. I mean, that's what both Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes are, really, they don't strike me as the most competitive decks there are but, you know... it still has the Dark Magician bricking issue though despite already cutting it down to just 2 copies. It also has the same problems with the other deck that I've been testing and working on lately - Branded Tearalaments - that sometimes the deck feels too slow and sometimes it just ramps up out of nowhere swiftly, though I think that only says much about the pilot and not necessarily about the deck itself, which makes sense since I love fast-paced decks, and speed is one of the most important criteria for me when it comes to testing decks, I'm still not sure. Regardless, the deck worked better than expected, definitely. It's still basically just two control decks that share incidental synergies being both Fusion strategies merged into one. Also, it's great that most if not all of the Dark Magician Fusion monsters are all Level 8, which is just the perfect Level for the Branded so, yeah. That's pretty much it. Also if you wanna do the Guardian Chimera thing, feel free to do so in this list only because the Extra Deck is actually pretty loose and you can afford to cut down some cards.

Consistent 5 negates and a floodgate.,"Simple plant Link, will change with DIFO coming out next month.  The idea is to try to end as often as possible with Benghalancer, Cactus, and some other negates or protection on the field when going first. This will require special summoning the Loci, however, so may not always be possible.  Get Loci on the field either by using Unexpected Dai, or White Roise Cloister if you have it or a Lonefire blossom to tribute to summon it from deck, if you have the cloister but no Lonefire nor Loci hopefully you have a Painful Decisions, and if not, let's hope you at least have a rescue rabbit.  Once you have a loci on the board, link it for a Dryas, activate Dryas to search Sowing, use Sowing to summon Twins from deck, then Chain Link 1 Dryas to heal the damage of the Sowing and summon a Sunvine Healer from Extra Deck, and Chain Link 2 the Twin to get the Loci back from grave. Use the effect of Healer to gain 300 health (don't forget this, it is needed to summon Laurel in a few effects).  Link off the Dryas and Healer for Jasmine, then use Jasmine's effect to tribute the Twin and summon Mardel from Deck (hoping she's not in your hand, else you'll have to get creative). Mardel effect on summon to search Laurel (if not in your hand), then Laurel effect to special summon itself.  Link Laurel and Mardel Loci into a second Jasmine. Activate Laurel's effect in grave to heal 500, and trigger the effects to search of both Jasmines.  This is where it becomes situational, and depends on what you have in your hand. If you have one of the Rikkas, and you haven't normal summoned yet, search the other Rikka and a Cactus Bouncer. If you have either Carrotweight or Spore in hand, and you haven't normal summoned yet, search the other and the Cactus Bouncer. If you have neither but you haven't normal summoned yet, but you have any other plant monster in hand, get Snowdrop and the Bouncer. If you have used your normal summon, either search a full package, or, if you have part of one in hand, get what you're missing and either Teardrop or Carrotweight. You may also opt to get the bouncer regardless since you'll most likely be able to normal summon it next turn after still making big bodies on the field if you can't OTK your opponent.  Once you've done your searches, the rest of the Sunavalon part is Jasmine and Mardel link into Melias, Melias effect to summon Loci from grave, Jasmine and Loci for Melias, Melias effect to summon Loci from grave again, then Loci link into the second Dryas, which searches for Shrine. Careful to summon the first Melias with the Jasmine in the main monster zone to a zone pointed by the one in the Extra monster zone, and the second in a zone next to that one, since Melias does not have a downward arrow, so if it is in the Extra zone, it will prevent you from link summoning without using it.  You can use Shrine now, or once you have the Dryantrentiay out, doesn't really matter, but remember that you need a Sunavalon Link Monster on the field to activate it. Once you do, if you have Carrotweight and Spore in hand, activate it by sending Carrotweight to grave, then use its effct by sending Spore to the grave to summon itself, then use Spore's effect in grave to banish Laurel and summon itself gaining 1 level from Laurel, which then lets you synchro the two of them off for Marjoram, which lets you search Blessed Winds. If you have a Rikka in Hand, you can tribute the Loci for their effect, and if Mudan comes out you can sarch Rikka Sheet. If you summon Snowdrop and another plant, use Snowdrop's effect to make them both level 8, then overlay them for Teardrop.  Link the Dryas and a Melias into Benghalancer, then link the Benghalancer and the other Melias into Dryantrentiay. Drientrentiay will search you Bloom from deck. Then use the effect of Benghalancer in grave to banish the Jasmines and summon itself back in a zone pointed by Dryantrentiay (preferably not the same one in case a column negation occurs).  Use Pot of Avarice now, if you have it, mainly resetting your extra deck so you don't throw too much back into the main deck, that way you have more odds of drawing some hand traps off it.  If you don't draw any extenders, normal summon the Cactus Bouncer, set whichever traps you got through the combos, and pass.  There is an alternate route for the Rikkas on which you end up with Strenna on the board, you can use her effect to add back a plant from grave to hand, do that before your turn, it's free real estate, as she will most likely be tributed next turn by Rikka Sheet to negate and steal a monster, and summon out Hyperyton with her as material attached to it.  Beware of the synergy between Blessed Winds and Marjoram: when you gain health, you can use Marjoram to pop a card.  Benghalancer bounces back to the hand in exchange for Life Points equal to the bounced monster's attack. If you have Cactus Bouncer up on the field with it, you can negate the card with one of your negates on summon, then bounce it back with Benghalancer, and they can't normal summon anymore, nor special summon unless they deal with the bouncer.  If your opponent tries to pop your plant link monsters, you can banish Sowing from grave to protect them.  While your LP are higher than your opponents and you have Marjoram on the field, your plant monsters cannot be targeted with card effects.  If you plan on putting out a Bouncer, do not try to go down the Strenna into Hyperyton line, as that is a special summon, which you cannot conduct while Bouncer is on your field.  Don't forget Benghalancer's recursion if it's taken off the field. It will be a target since Dryantrentiay cannot be target by effects nor attacks.  Dryantrentiay's effect is not a quick effect, but on your turn you can pop a link monster it points to (wink wink to Benghalancer who can come back), and pop as many cards your opponent controls as it had Link rating (so most likely 4).  Every turn after activating Shrine, it gives you a free Loci from grave, which can be turned into a thrasher, that can get 4k attack thanks to Dryantrentiay being on the field, but beware it will be destroyed if Dryantrentiay is destroyed by a non-targeting effect.  Bloom, beyond negating all face up monsters on your opponent's field when activated if you have a link 4 plant (Benghalancer counts) also lets you make a plant link monster gain attack equal to that of all the cards it points to. So if you first use Thrasher to kill a monster, then use its effect to summon it back to a zone pointed by the big tree, you can increase the attack of Dryantrentiay by that much more when it attacks. If you can get a second thrasher out, try to put the Benghalancer in a zone not pointed by Dryantrentiay when you summon it back, that way you can have 2 4k Thrashers and a big monster from your opponent's grave fueling the big tree's attack through Bloom.  If you run into a lot of Nibirus, you can play Sales Ban, or you can try other variants of the deck that run the Brave package, but that would triple the cost of the deck. Also feel free to adapt hand traps and Side deck to your scene's habits."

Makes uses of Curious thanks to the Sacred Beast side of the deck, making the Eldl","The Deck's pretty simple, you get out Eldlich and make uses of the Golden Land traps to keep your opponent form getting their combos off to the point they can kill yeah. And if you're lucky you can bring out Uria for the big numbers!  More seriously this deck is making use of the fact that Sacred Beasts have an easy line to Curious that allows them to dump Eldlich to get him into rotation. From there it's slandered eldlich stuff while sometimes getting out Uria to remove set cards and deal massive damage thanks to the boatload of continuous traps and the grave, pumped up even further if you manage to get Hyper Blaze on the field. The extra deck is mostly just a toolbox of stuff to help deal with cards and deal enough damage for game. The exceptions to this are the trifecta of cards that are central to this deck, Linkuriboh, Relinquished Anima, and Curious. By utilizing the fact that Chaos Summoning Beast is a level 1 that can be summoned by Dark Beckoning Beast and brought back by Opening of The Spirt Gates you can easily make Linkuriboh and Relinquished Anima. Along with the Dark Beckoning on field that's enough material for Curious."

Generally by dumping Coelacanth with Lifeless Leafish, stacking into Dugares, and then going full Turbo.  <strong>General Turn 1 examples</strong>: <em>Special Tenyi-Shthana, Normal Lifeless Leafish, dump Fish Boi, make Dugares, special Fish Boi, turbo</em>  <em>Summoner Monk, discard spell, special Leafish, dump Fish boi, make Dugares, special Fish Boi, TURBO</em>  <em>One for One into Beutunaful Princess, special Leafish, dump Fish boi. Summon another level 4 fish                                                                                                                             (White Stingray, Silent Angler, etc.), make Dugares, TURBO</em>  <b>Once you go Turbo, make sure you grab Oyster Meister and Royal Swamp Eel as a baseline and summon 2 other fish situationally. You can generally make a Link-2 out of Dugares and Coelacanth, then make either Abyss Dweller or Bahamut into Toadally Awesome. Once you've made some space, synchro into Monoceros, special Coelacanth back and then discard a card to summon Fishborg or another Swamp Eel out. Then you can easily go into Dragite, turn the token into a Linkuriboh and then use the Link-2, Linkuriboh, and Big Fish Boi to make Apollousa.</b>  <strong>Important card explanations:</strong>  Deep Sea Dive/Guitar Gurnards: One card combo to make Dragite or Monoceros. Diva can also summon Minstrel to fill graveyard and stack an extender on top of the deck.  Eria: My choice for a generic Link-2. Has some functionality against decks that run Water Monsters and is a Water monster itself (works with Abyss Dweller).  Deep Sea Minstrel: Crucial to pick out Ash Blossom or Impermanence out of your opponent's hand before going Turbo. Also provides synergy with Diva.  Linkuriboh: Generic Link-1, ideally turns your Oyster Token into something that can make Apollousa. Can also be summoned from the grave with Beautunaful Princess to deal with big boss monsters during battle phase.  <strong>Other Possible Budget Card Choices (not included):</strong>  Knightmare Phoenix: Pops Macro Cosmos or Dimensional Fissure. Having access to the grave is critical for the deck.  Glacial Beast Iceberg Narwhal: Great finisher card, helps insure lethal.  (<em>this is a WIP and will be updated as I prepare to enter tournaments in the future. Feedback welcome. Enjoy!)</em>"

Isn't Meta but surprisingly is consistent and fun to play. Gadget players: ""No you can't just take my monsters for free"". Re","Ok so this Deck, the second one from N/R Format. This Deck wasn't built by me I received a lot of help by some Discord users named Domnostein [Megalith Best Deck!] and Monk, The Local Ballpark Player (Yes this was in a N/R Format Discord Server). This is a really budget Relinquished deck it's extremely cheap.  The objective is summoning Relinquished. For that you can use the Impcantation engine to speed up the strategy and making it more consistent, I completly forgot this engine so at first I was thinking of Djinn of Rituals Archetype and Sphere Kuriboh to try to have more options for the Deck.  The main weakness for this deck it's the fact that you NEED enemy monsters to kill your opponent, being Sonic Bird, Manju, and Senju your ""Beaters"" with 1400 ATK; so in the case you have your 3 copies of Relinquished in the GY and no way to recover it, that's GG; it's like an Pure Eldlitch having it's 3 copies of Eldlitch banished face down or absorbed by a Thousand Eyes Restricted.  After testing it out the best option it's going second. 'Cause your best combos ends with Relinquished and when you do that going first you hav in the best of cases 1 maybe 2 Relinquished with 1 or 2 Impcantation monster.  If you feel very brave you could try it out in Rankeds, you'll regret it very quickly.  Have fun. :3"

This setup probably isn't very fun to play against, but it's effective and it works in most cases.</p><p>--Scythe Lock--</p><p>Ideally, you want to go first with this deck to set up the Scythe lock. While there are many full combo hands that you can draw to facilitate this play, your main goal in the first step of the Scythe lock is to get Scales, Soulpiercer, and an SHS tuner on the field. In order to do this, you need to activate the effect of Scarecrow and then tribute it to activate the effect of Soulpeacemaker. From here, use Scales and Soulpiercer to Link Summon Dagda. Activate Soulpiercer once again to add Soulclaw to your hand. Then, equip Soulclaw to the SHS tuner you left on your field in order to activate its on-field effect and trigger Dagda. After you Summon Soulclaw and set Scythe, use Dagda and the SHS tuner to Link Summon Halquifibrax. Proceed to activate Halquifibrax's effect to Summon Ghost Belle from your deck. Finally, using Soulclaw and Ghost Belle, Synchro Summon Naturia Beast. At this point, the Scythe lock is set and you can end your turn.</p><p>During your opponent's turn, use Halquifibrax's effect to Summon Wonder Magician as quickly as possible. I personally wait to use this when my opponent controls a monster in order to stop Gamma. After Wonder Magician is Summoned, use its effect to destroy Scythe. After you Summon Scythe to your field, activate Wonder Magician's effect to Synchro Summon Baronne de Fleur using Scythe as material. And there you have it. One omni-negate, one Imperial Order on legs, and one Extra Deck lock on your opponent. If your opponent is playing a standard combo deck, this is probably where they are going to scoop.</p><p>--Auroradon-Borreload-Musashi-Follow-Up--</p><p>As a follow-up, you can get three SHS monsters on the field to Link Summon Auroradon. Use Auroradon's effect to Summon O'Lion from the deck by making it tribute itself and a token. Using your present materials, Synchro Summon Borreload Savage Dragon and equip it with Auroradon from the grave. You can also activate O'Lion's effect to Summon a token. If you also managed to add Trumpeter to your hand earlier, you can use it and the O'Lion token to Summon Musashi and recycle a machine monster for later use.</p><p>--General Tips--</p><p>Soulpeacemaker, Soulpiercer, and Wagon are the three critical pieces of this deck. Soulpeacemaker Special Summons from the deck, Soulpiercer has a non-once-per-turn search effect, and Wagon is the searcher that searches out these two searchers. Another very integral part of this deck is Scarecrow, which you will usually use to trigger Soulpiercer's effect and to recycle resources for more combos and plays. Another less crucial but still important card is Flutist, which can save you from Effect Veiler and Infinite Impermanence. Outside of these necessary cards, I also packed in cards for different situations. Lithosagym can be a mini Scythe in case you brick. Jizukiru is good for removal and Gandarla is good for getting rid of the Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds in a Floowandereeze deck. Tunneler is good for recycling your SHS monsters, especially for the Scarecrows and Musashi.</p><p>For the cards in the Extra Deck, you use Musashi to recycle important machine monsters and to maybe even recycle Jizukiru. If you're in need of a Harpie's Feather Duster, Synchro Summon Ogre Shutendoji to clear your opponent's backrow. If you need to use your opponent's Spell and Trap cards to keep surviving, you can Summon out Warlord Susanowo. For a quick finisher, you can Summon out Steam Train King by either Synchro Summoning it normally or using Battleball's effect on a Jizukiru you gave to your opponent. If you ever get stuck with bad hand, Xyz Summoning out Bagooska and hope for the best. Bagooska is also good going second if you have Scales and a Level 4 monster.

Link below:</span></p> <span>( <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=btLm4BQf2ew&amp;feature=youtu.be"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=btLm4BQf2ew&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> )</span>  -Exo  &nbsp;  So our Dragon fren has been getting quite the reception recently, and it was about time I got into making a non-Despia related Branded list myself. The reason of choosing an Orcust - Shaddoll hybrid list was simple: both have quite an oddly unique synergy to each other. Not because they're both Dark; but the GY synergy they both work upon to me interest me for some reason. It's a little rare for some people to appreciate the love oddball synergy between two unexpected things; but it does happen in this game from time to time. The Branded pieces (while not the biggest player in this deck) still does what it needs to do best, and here it was truly matters.  Now for the most part, you just have two copies of <a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz</a> and one copy of <a data-name=""Albion the Shrouded Dragon"">Albion the Shrouded Dragon (with the usual three copies of </a><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">Branded Fusion), because obviously this is the norm thanks to the ""Heathenry"" caused by the Despia archetype, and the lackluster exploitation of </a><a data-name=""Super Polymerization"">Super Polymerization</a><a data-name=""Branded Fusion"">. Speaking of which, didn't I forget to mention that a Shaddoll package was in here? Yep, it's pretty basic (with just 2 copies of </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Squatma"">Shaddoll Squatma</a><a data-name=""Branded Fusion""> and </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">Shaddoll Dragon, and a copy each of </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Hedgehog"">Shaddoll Hedgehog</a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon""> and </a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Beast"">Shaddoll Beast</a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon"">); but because of this, I also opted to run a copy of </a><a data-name=""Trickstar Corobane"">Trickstar Corobane</a><a data-name=""Shaddoll Dragon""> and </a><a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow "">Fairy Tail - Snow (to be used to Fusion summon either </a><a data-name=""Albion the Branded Dragon"">Albion the Branded Dragon</a><a data-name=""Fairy Tail - Snow ""> or </a><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Construct "">El Shaddoll Construct). Now as for our favourite devastator to all DARK-attribute monsters </a><a data-name=""Super Polymerization "">Super Polymerization, I have two Extra Deck targets that can help clear away some issues; but both could also be used with the effect of </a><a data-name=""Fallen of Albaz"">Fallen of Albaz: </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">Predaplant Dragostapelia (used to rid of hard to handle monsters like </a><a data-name=""Despia Quaeritis"">Despia Quaeritis)</a><a data-name=""Predaplant Dragostapelia"">  and </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum"">Predaplant Triphyoverutum (as a board wipe, better than </a><a data-name=""Guardian Chimera"">Guardian Chimera</a><a data-name=""Predaplant Triphyoverutum""> IMO).</a>  Finally comes the discussing point here: The Orcust engine and why I added it in. Truth is that I find the GY consistency of Orcust to always come in handy in decks like Shaddolls in times of need (with or without <a data-name=""Orcust Harp Horror"">Orcust Harp Horror). With that being said (knowing that </a><a data-name=""Predaplant Verte Anaconda "">Predaplant Verte Anaconda is on its way out), I have added the only engine that truly matters to the Orcust engine as we speak: three copies of Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight, two copies of </a><a data-name=""Orcust Knightmare"">Orcust Knightmare, and one copy of both World Legacy-""World Wand"" and </a><a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">Orcust Cymbal Skeleton. All of them which allowed me to not only get the usual Link monsters that Orcust requires (such as </a><a data-name=""Galatea, the Orcust Automation"">Galatea, the Orcust Automation</a><a data-name=""Orcust Cymbal Skeleton"">), but also be apart in the process of the fusion summoning requirements for both the Branded and Shaddoll monsters as ""backup payment"" (especially for </a><a data-name=""El Shaddoll Winda"">El Shaddoll Winda). </a>  &nbsp;"

But I’m glad to be back at it!,"<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Hi guys! Welcome back to a magistus list!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I haven’t made a guide in a while, but I decided to make one today for some reason, I don’t know why.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This isn’t a Complete Breakdown guide, this is just a list of card reasonings and other stuff. </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But overall this particular deck is what I like to call magistus calamity turbo, it’s a moderately successful form of deck that’s very control oriented.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But for now, the cards!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Fairy Tail Snow</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Snow was recently released from its long stay on the banlist, it got banned because it had no once per turn clause on it meaning it provided additional interruption in some decks. But as a level 4 spellcaster I can also use it to make plays in addition to other things. Pretty helpful if you ask me.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Crowley is simple enough, you can discard a spellcaster and summon him then you can flip his attribute (this effect is virtually useless) and reequip a magistus if he’s in the graveyard. Solid extender and played at three.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Incredible Esscaila the Virtuous</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Esscaila from the short lived rein of swordsouls serves a purpose in magistus for being capable of behaving as a tuner for the synchro summon of the Calamity or risen. Sadly though she hits your wallet pretty hard because of how she was abused by other decks.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Zoroa is the most valuable of the Magistus. He allows you to equip summon search and more! Even though there is only two effects on him he’s worth playing three of in magistus alone.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Endymion the Magistus of Mastery</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Endymion is a magistus with a unique position in the deck, it plus ones your hand and draws are always welcome, but at the same time it kinda lacks something. I opted three though because I love my advantage and it’s water so I can play dragite.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Performage Hat Tricker</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If two or more monsters are on the field you can just summon it from your hand, that’s all I need from it ngl so I play a copy. Other players can opt for more of this card and it’s pretty solid in Magistus but I personally slip by with one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Rilliona the Magician of Verre</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rilliona will soon grow to become the founder of the witchcrafters but for now she is one of Magistus’s most valuable cards as she is a searcher for spells and traps with a helpful grave effect to equip another Magistus.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Ash Blossom and Joyous Spring</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Need I say why?</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Spellbook Magician of Prophecy</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Even though it takes up the normal summon this card is definitely an option to consider when playing Magistus, I play the full blown knowledge package.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Magician’s Souls</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Souls currently holds a unique place in the metagame for being able to refresh your hand, but what Magistus has over others when it comes to souls is that I can use it to pitch my used-up equips for draws and it doesn’t even take a normal summon to do so! If you’re to play Magistus and can afford it PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE play the magicians souls package, I promise it’ll make your life so much easier.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Illusion of Chaos</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Illusion of Chaos searches magicians souls and packs itself into the deck making it pretty valuable on that front. I recommend playing it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Trismagistus</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The continuous spell for Magistus is a very solid card for them, in other decks this wouldn’t be the same way but Magistus has a severe lack of ways to summon over certain amount of monsters from your hand each turn. Plus this card provides a continuous protection effect!</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Foolish Burial</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Being able to send snow to the graveyard is a good enough reason alone to play this. And even if you can’t send snow (AKA you opened it) you can still set up Crowley or Rilliona and get their grave effects ready</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Magistus Invocation</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Rilliona’s main search invocation is a fusion spell that can fuse away your equips and the fusion monster it can summon is also a very solid boss so I recommend playing this card, you can get it easily enough by draws or Rilliona so please don’t play more than one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Magistus Virtra</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A revival spell with a built in protection effect is valuable to a deck that wants to keep one monster out and you can also pitch it with souls if it is clogging.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Spellbook of Knowledge</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Part of the Knowledge engine this card lets you plus pretty easily, 10/10 would recommend.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Spellbook of Secrets</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The last part of the Knowledge engine Secrets is three extra copies of the plus 1 this engine provides.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One to summon and one to equip, Aiwass is an interruption who also makes it harder to beat over your boss monsters, playing three is a mistake and one is fine but I prefer two.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Adamacipator Risen-Dragite</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dragite can gain its interruption from Endymion or the Spellbook magician, that’s the only reasoning I’ll give you on this front, the rest you can infer for yourself. (For the record this is a pretty flexible slot so if you want you can try some other cards go right ahead, I went with what I thought I could get the most mileage out of)</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">2 Zoroa the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The boos of the whole deck. Level 8 synchro, equips for the extra on synchro summon and locks the effects of fusions links xyzs and synchros when properly set up. It also helps that it can revive on a whim for the grind game.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Vahram the Magistus Divinity Dragon</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Like always, a dragon. Vahram, has a solid equipped effect as far as protection goes and moreover has a hilarious secondary effect that people overlook, if it’s on the field by a synchro summon ant it is popped the opponents entire field actually just goes BOOM, if you know your opponent doesn’t read summon it as a bait, I personally have just summoned it and rammed it into something to dismantle boards before as well.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Peformage Trampanzee Magician</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This card allows you to push for game or pop stuff your opponents have so don’t be scared to use it, it has come clutch for me before.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Ninaru the Magistus Glass Goddess </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ninaru recycles and rids opponents of some pretty pesky spells so I like to play it at one because I don’t need more than that.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Rilliona the Magistus Glass Witch Wardrobe</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Summoning a Magistus from deck is helpful if you need certain ones in a pinch but playing one is probably the best choice like Ninaru</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Accesscode </span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Because I can make it off of selene and push for game</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Selene’s job is simple enough, make Accesscode and help push for game, but you can also use her to extend other plays as well. You should only need to use one.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">1 Crowley, the First Propheteer</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One of the Magistus’s grown up version, Crowley grew to be the leader of the Spellbook archetype and the forever meme: NS Alister, search Invocation. But as a dark for accesscode, a solid link 2 stepping stone on your way to selene, and able to search a part of the Knowledge package this Crowley is a pretty helpful assist to this build, I would recommend running him if you’re using the Spellbook package.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">3 Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The reason why this card is pricy is because it’s simply put: solid invocation food. Playing three helps a lot because it searches, it lets Zoroa lock links, and it’s probably just the best Magistus card in the game, but for the wrong reason.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Magistus is a pretty low laying archetype in the current format but it’s very fun and even better, easy to build! It feels great to play it.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You may notice that the list I have finished writing a guide for is heavy on card advantage, and your right, that’s what this build does, it tries to lock your opponents down and amasses resources until it can go for the kill. Despite this looking underwhelming it is actually pretty efficient at times.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">What this deck lacks the most is definitely kill power, but generating advantage on a whim is definitely very helpful.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Overall I would classify this particular list as a midrange deck as it pumps out something and preps your hand for the next turn until it can kill. I can see people calling this control and I understand why but my experience is that I’m doing too many combo based plays that I don’t feel like it’s actually control.</span></p> <p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Questions will be answered and I’m more than happy to respond to comments!</span></p>"

I've added anti-spell fragrance and Night Beam to the side deck, along with D.D. Crow.  &nbsp;  EDIT 2: I decided to just forego the Krawler and just play Mine. Works better for what I need it for, and I'm not using it for some burn deck or what have you, so i don't have much guilt in using Mine in this context. I also tried to cut it down to a 40 card deck. Figuring out what to add, what to remove, what to reduce or increase, etc. was a little tricky, but I think what I have is fairly consistent (well, as consistent as a deck with Generaiders, 3 Parallel eXceed, and a main deck Evil Twin boss monster can be).  &nbsp;  EDIT 3: I've been tweaking around my Mystic Mine searchers, as well as I've added 2 Pot of Dualities to support my secondary stall-strategy. I would run a strategy other than Mine if other strategies were more affordable considering this is going to be my IRL deck. Lightning Storm, Forbidden Droplet and Pot of Prosperity really need lower rarity prints at some point.  &nbsp;  EDIT 4: I tried to prioritize making the deck more budget friendly since I feel like the main reason someone would even be playing a Mine deck is if money is an issue (given that its still stupidly cheap compared to cards like Droplet)."

For full combos, watch: https://youtu.be/pttLC3YfmLo","In the original build, I missed adding Called By The Grave, so I added it here.  Things you should know about the deck: Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode's effect to negate and comeback to the field is not hard once per turn, so you can still chain Torrential Tribute at the end of the turn when it comes back, your opponent will chain some negate or effect to protect his monsters not knowing that you can negate again taking your Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode out of the field safe from destruction, then it will comeback again, and all of this during the end phase and this can be done over and over again. Assault Sentinel when tributed to special summon 1 monster from your hand or deck that specifically lists ""Assault Mode Activate"" in its text, locks you from special summoning monsters from the extra deck for the rest of the turn, except for synchro monsters. When you use Assault Sentinel's effect and it leaves the field, PSY-Framegear Gamma becomes live to negate any hand trap since there are no monsters on your side. If you have Plaguespreader Zombie &amp; Emergency Teleport/One For One, you can bait hand traps using the Halqifibrax &amp; Auroradon combo, then use Emergency Teleport to summon Psi-Reflector and do your main combo. If Assault Sentinel gets negated and you have Emergency Teleport/One For One, you can special summon Psi-Reflector and continue combo. You can use Emergency Teleport to summon Ghost Ogre &amp; Snow Rabbit on you opponent's turn for an interruption since its effect activates on the field as well.  https://youtu.be/pttLC3YfmLo"
