<strong>TURN 2</strong> -From here you should be able to start building up your graveyard and start getting out some bigger monsters from your extra deck or use other extra deck monsters depending on your situation.On this step you would want to use a lot of your resources and begin to damage push with high attack extra deck monsters.

<strong>TURN 3/Onwards</strong>-At this point (unless you got screwed over by a bunch of negs)you will depending on your situation start to have main control over the board as your boardstate even if you get boardwiped can and should be regained with relative ease using cards like:Vendread Evolution,Spectrallsword(both) ,Mezuki ,Vendread Revolution and your extra Mayakashi extra deck monsters who will comeback depending on the monster you lost

<strong>Overall</strong>-This is a self made damage push deck which I personally think can really begin to push the interpretation and usage of zombies.On that note I hope you enjoy this deck as much as I do (and not quit on it after 1 bad game)because this deck like any other takes some time to get used to but after you get the hang of it you should be able to use it flawlessly:)"

Tem como principal objetivo impedir as jogadas do seu oponente, neutralizando seus movimentos deixando seus monstros em posição de defesa com a face para baixo. O objetivo deste deck é trazer uma boa jogabilidade para o deck sem que perca sua originalidade. <strong>Metodologia:</strong> Esse Deck foi elaborado a partir de jogos experimentais, e de uma revisão de Decks e jogos adquiridos nas plataforma:  YGOPRODECK e YouTube. As palavras chaves utilizadas foram ""Baralho"" e ""Fantardil"" e suas correspondentes em inglês, ""Deck"" e ""Ghostrick"". Foram critérios de exclusão: Decks e jogos publicados antes de 2018 e os que se referiam à Decks que não utilizavam os monstros Ghostrick como ferramentas principais. Somando-se todas as bases de dados, foram encontrados 20 Decks. Após a observação de seus cards, notou-se que alguns deles se repetiram nas diferentes bases e outros não preenchiam os critérios deste estudo. Foram selecionados 5 Decks e excluídos os que não conseguiram utilizar-se combos após 5 partidas e finalizou-se com 3 decks mais a minha subjetividade. <strong>Resultados:</strong> O deck aponta que a utilização de XYZ é importante para o funcionamento do deck, porém é necessário trazer os LINKS por conta do novo META-GAME. O jogo é demorado e obedece a uma ordem constante; Mudar posição de batalha do inimigo, utilização de xyz e ataque direto. Foi visto que os jogos que menos se utilizaram xyz seguiram de derrotas. <strong>Conclusão:</strong> O  deck tem como principal objetivo o uso de XYZ para ter domínio sobre o oponente e obter um jogo mais rápido e eficaz."

<b>Wyrm</b> (Japanese:<i>Genryū</i>, ""Phantom Dragon"") is a <a title=""Type"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Type"">Type</a> of <a title=""Monster Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Card"">monster</a> introduced in <i><a title=""Duelist Alliance"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Duelist_Alliance"">Duelist Alliance</a></i>.

A wyrm (pronounced worm or vurm) is a type of dragon that commonly appears in British and Norse mythology. These dragons have no legs or arms and only the long, scaled body of a serpent. They are often given poisonous breath and the ability to regenerate or reattach pieces of their body that have been cut off.

Wyrm-Type monsters resemble dragons, but unlike <a title=""Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon"">Dragon</a>-Type monsters, they take more of a spiritual, mythical, metaphysical look. Most of the initial Wyrm-Type monsters were part of the ""<a title=""Yang Zing"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Yang_Zing"">Yang Zing</a>"" archetype, which seems to be based on Chinese dragons and/or other animals within Chinese lore, such as tigers, resembling ""<a title=""Tiger Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Tiger_Dragon"">Tiger Dragon</a>"" and ""<a title=""Orient Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Orient_Dragon"">Orient Dragon</a>"" (which are both Dragons, however). ""<a title=""Dracocension"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dracocension"">Dracocension</a>"", the first generic support card for this type, hints that there is a relationship between Dragon-Type monsters and Wyrm-Type monsters. After the release of the Yang Zing, two more <a title=""Archetype"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Archetype"">archetypes</a> have been released: ""<a title=""True Draco and True King"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/True_Draco_and_True_King"">True King</a>""/""<a title=""True Draco and True King"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/True_Draco_and_True_King"">True Draco</a>"" and ""<a title=""Metaphys"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Metaphys"">Metaphys</a>"".

A 91% chance of summoning an Anger Knuckle alongside it? Boy, Trains sure has come a long way!  (L","<em>This deck is for the TCG/OCG metagame on YgoPro. For the purely OCG version, see <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://ygoprodeck.com/trains-2019-ocg"">https://ygoprodeck.com/trains-2019-ocg</a></em>

&nbsp;

It took a <em>long</em> time of believing that pure Trains didn't have enough good cards to be real good in TCG, and that it always benefited more from a second archetype - Kaiju, Cyber Dragons, or Shaddoll - but finally, I've got something I believe can actually beat the competition! I present to you: a calculated approach to Trains! <em>Edit: that was, until Sky Strikers demonstrated to be good enough to be included too. Whatever.</em>

Let's start with the odds, since <a>I made a script specifically to calculate them</a>: this deck has <em>(with slightly old numbers) </em><em>a</em> 86.6% chance of summoning a big honkin' Juggernaut Liebe T1, and a 97.8% chance on T2 if going second. It also has a 76.6% chance T1/95.4% T2 chance of summoning a Double Header alongside it, seeing up future plays. In fact, there's a 50.5% chance T1 that you'll have a Switchyard too, meaning you get a Super Dora and full board before they even get to play!  Oh, and it draw an average of 0.95 cards at the end of the turn, thanks to End-Of-Turn-drawing cards. Here's how the averaged T1/T2 stats compare to other Trains decks:

&nbsp;

The deck strategy is simple: summon Liebe every turn, and if you have trains to spare, summon Anger Knuckle too. And try resummoning Bullet Liner and Ruffian Railcar as much as you can.

For the Extra Deck: if you're going second then replace the traps/Pots Of Desires with the Shaddoll set.

Always go first, unless up against an OTK deck. Yes, really. Sure, it can OTK too, but the sheer majority of your opponents would much rather you go second.

&nbsp;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

...More detail? Alright, let's talk about some of the cards.
<ul>
 	<li>Going first might sound unintuitive, considering it's an OTK-capable deck, but there's a lot of plays you want to make going first. Letting the opponent have an extra card is worth it.</li>
 	<li>Ruffian Railcar is definitely the weakest of the five trains. Still worth a one-of though. Just one.</li>
 	<li>Sky Strikers, using Hayate, let you summon two Machine monsters with one card. Which lets you summon Anger Knuckle. That's a big deal.</li>
 	<li>Adding more normal-summonable Earth Machines hardly changes the odds. Seriously, adding in <a data-name=""Swift Scarecrow"">Swift Scarecrow</a>, for example, only increases the Liebe odds by 0.5%.</li>
 	<li>Don't hate me for Needlefiber &amp; Sorceress. They're just too good a combo in this deck to leave out. ...And yes, having exactly three non-Ash tuners <em>is</em> best for odds, apparently.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Blitzkrieg Bombardment"">Blitzkrieg Bombardment,</a> <a data-name=""All-Out Attacks"">All-Out Attacks, and Xyz Veil</a> would be pretty great... if I had any faith in them sticking around. But I don't.</li>
 	<li>I used to use Pinpoint Landing, Imperial Order, and Turbo Booster, but they eventually got bullied out of the deck by better tech cards.</li>
 	<li>No, Kaiju are not good enough.</li>

As of this moment, ""Double Header Anger Knuckle"" is not officially released yet so I temporarily include Qliphort Genius as their link monster (Earth Machine with some protection and Bottom Left/Bottom Right Arrow)

The main strategy this deck is simple, summon the big guys like Super Dora, Gustav Max, Liebe and just go ham on the opponent with their massive damage.

<strong>Main Deck Monsters</strong>

<em><strong>Derricrane</strong></em> is one of the best material to have to go for the OTK since it can destroy 1 opponent's card after being detached.

<em><strong>Ruffian</strong></em> is your quick Lvl10 monster search, I would advise not to use his burning effect since it will hinder your battle phase. You can use it if it's lethal tho :D

<em><strong>Buller Liner</strong></em> the newly added support card that can massively boost the consistency since it can be special summoned if all monsters you have are EARTH Machine monster (which is technically every monster in this deck except <strong>Metal Reflect Slime</strong> and <strong>Malefic Cyber End</strong> - and <strong>Ash Blossom</strong> is for hand use, if you have to use her on the field as the defense then you are in trouble already). It's level 10 for <strong>Urgent Schedule</strong> and the Xyz Summoning. The 3000 ATK can be used for <strong>Special Schedule. </strong>It also has a float recycling effect so this card is your main support card.

<strong><em>Pegasus</em> </strong> your one card Xyz (if you have any lvl 10 monsters in your GY). It can copy the level of that revived monster so Xyz is very very easy with this guy around. One simple way to have Lvl 10 in the graveyard is by chucking them to the GY via <strong>Switchyard</strong>

&nbsp;

This deck lack defense for the big guys (except Super Dora) so it's crucial that you clear up the board and make sure nothing stands in the way and that role belongs to the Spell and Trap.

&nbsp;

<strong>Spell/Trap:</strong>

The aim is to keep up the presence on the field with summoning cards like Special Schedule, Monster Reborn (optional), Urgent Schedule, Switchyard

Also, I added a few cards to clean up the opponent field before going for the full attack like  Twin Twister, Red Reboot, Mirror Force

&nbsp;

<strong>Side deck:</strong>

Contain mostly some situational cards that can alleviate some problems like banish, opponent card advantages

Evenly Matched can wipe out the whole board but one card left so you should have easy time OTK the opponent

&nbsp;

<strong>Extra Deck</strong>

Loaded with Rank 10 Xyz monsters that can deal with a lot of scenarios.

<strong>Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer</strong> (what a mouthful and cool name) can clear the opponent's back row and enable you to get Liebe out for the big punch

<strong>Dyson Sphere </strong>is your main card to get rid of annoying cards like Beelze (one of your dreadful counter) or any monsters that cannot be destroyed by just attack damage

<strong>Juggernaut Liebe</strong> the biggest hitter I've seen in a while, this guy can attack monsters equal to its Material number +1 so with 3 materials (normal Xyz + the Xyz monsters itself used for Liebe's summoning) can give you 4 attacks. That's enough to wipe the board clean if the opponent spam summons and possibly and OTK if they leave their weaker monsters in attack positions. I love using this card to punish monsters that cannot be destroyed by battle in attack positions since I can keep hitting it.

<strong>Super Dora</strong> is your main guy to go for if you are unsure what the opponent is up to OR you know exactly what the opponent is up to :)) Its effect to let a card be unaffected by card effect is very handy, one cool way to use it on opponent monsters is if you know they have <strong>Honest</strong> on their hand or if they try to use <strong>Clashing Soul</strong> on you. <strong>Super Dora</strong> can shut down most offensive options your opponent tries to go since it also have a big body of 3200 ATK and 4000 DEF.

<strong>Gustav Max </strong>your one massive burner. 2000 effect damage makes you a glorified <strong>Gagaga Cowboy</strong>

One basic OTK is to summon Gustav with Derricrane and another rank 10 and detach 1 material to inflict 2000 damage (Esp. Derricrane if they have anything defending) then Rank up to Juggernaut Liebe and detach one material from Liebe to get the 6000 ATK to finish the opponent. Short and simple

Thanks for reading guys, I hope this deck can provide you some nice entertainment of wrecking the opponent's strong start that lack defense (most decks I see nowadays focus a lot on offense and lack defense so if they can't stop you from getting out Gustav Max and Liebe, you should have easy time winning the match)

Well here you go! This deck may seem crazy at first but once you play it you'll soon realize how good this deck is. This is a special deck I've been working on for you guys for about a month now and it's a masterpeace (no pun intended) haha. After testing this from scratch I've combined all these archetypes and they function very well together. This deck is strictly good for going second, you want to go second whenever possible. Using <a data-name=""True King Agnimazud, The Vanisher"">True King Agnimazud, The Vanisher</a> to destroy the Fire King and or Infernoid monsters in hand makes it so you can use the Fire King's effects plus get an Infernoid in grave for a summon of another one and allows you to banish a monster on the field from Agnimazud's effect. The Mekk-Knight monsters help otk very quickly. Using <a data-name=""Evenly Matched"">Evenly Matched</a> destroys your opponent when they commit all their resources on their first turn when they go first. You have so many options in your hand so you can bait out their negates and then use Evenly to get rid of all their resources and then on your next turn! The Invoked engine is also really good and is the normal summon condition of the deck since there are no other monsters to normal summon except <a data-name=""Fire King Avatar Arvata"">Fire King Avatar Arvata</a> which is the other normal summon of the deck, but you mainly want Aleister unless you're forced to go first. A cool combo I like to do is to special summon <a data-name=""Mekk-Knight Blue Sky"">Mekk-Knight Blue Sky</a> and then get out one of the ghost girls and use them to go into <a data-name=""PSY-Framelord Omega"">PSY-Framelord Omega</a>. Overall, this deck is really solid and can win against a lot of decks even meta decks. I've beaten Sky Striker multiple times using this deck because they can't handle all the monsters on board and get overwhelmed. I really hope you all enjoy and as always stick around for more!"

– Powerful OTK Bosses
– Advanced Ritual Art is Unbound","ShinoBErd

Rating: 8.5/10

Strengths:
- Blue-Eyes monsters turn on Advanced Ritual Art, affording consistency to a playstyle that usually doesn't have it in Trinity
- Shinobirds usually fall short of the OTK, but 3000-attack beaters can easily make up the remainder
- Some decks just can't out Amano-Iwato

Weakness:
- All-in style of gameplay can fold to midrange decks
- Sometimes you just draw all ritual spells
- Hands without the Shinobirds just feel like a mediocre BEWD build

Trinities:

I've just have been busy but I have been cooking up some cool decks for you guys and this is one of them. Just keep waiting and there will be many more made from scratch decks from me in the near future! I hope everyone had a really great Thanksgiving yesterday. The idea of Thunder Dragon Dinosaurs has been going around for a while now and I just haven't been paying attention so I decided to make my own version from scratch with the <a data-name=""Naturia Beast"">Naturia Beast</a> combo I've made in some of the other decks I've released that uses <a data-name=""Giant Rex"">Giant Rex</a> and <a data-name=""Glow-up Bulb"">Glow-up Bulb</a>. This deck wants to go first and I do admit it can brick sometimes. But I still like it because when it doesn't brick it can really go off! And it can play through some handtraps going first depending on what you draw and what their handtraps are. You can easily play through ash and ogre. Because you can draw into both the Thunder Dragon and Dinosaur engines and then your opponent will ash one of the engines like <a data-name=""Souleating Oviraptor"">Souleating Oviraptor</a> but then you have the Thunder Dragon engine like <a data-name=""Thunder Dragondark"">Thunder Dragonhawk</a> and or the any of the other Thunder Dragon monsters to go into <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Colossus"">Thunder Dragon Colossus</a>. Some games I am able to get out Nat Beast, a Colossus, a <a data-name=""Thunder Dragon Titan"">Thunder Dragon Titan</a>, and an <a data-name=""Ultimate Conductor Tyranno"">Ultimate Conductor Tyranno</a>. There's no way your opponent can beat that going second unless they main <a data-name=""Evenly Matched or Kaijus"">Evenly Matched or Kaijus</a>. There are other cards to counter it but you get the point, there aren't many and most people don't main them. I hope you guys enjoy this deck and stick around for more soon :)."

Due to their Japanese names, a number of unrelated cards, such as ""<a title=""Grass Phantom"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Grass_Phantom"">Grass Phantom</a>"" and ""<a title=""Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Odd-Eyes_Phantom_Dragon"">Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon</a>"", also fall into this archetype.

His name was first mentioned on-screen in episode 21; before that, his name was displayed as <b>Unknown</b> on-screen and he was called <b>the Dark Duelist</b> in promotional materials and the <b>Dark Masked Duelist</b> by characters in the series. He is a Duelist of <a title=""The Resistance"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/The_Resistance"">the Resistance</a>, despite his peaceful and harmless nature.

''<strong>Cyber</strong>"" (サイバー Saibā) is an <a title=""Archetype"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Archetype"">archetype</a> of cards used by several characters in the <i><a title=""Yu-Gi-Oh!

Duelists who use this archetype are said to be practitioners of ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Cyber Style"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cyber_Style"">Cyber Style</a>"".

Thematically, the cards in this archetype tend to resemble futuristic warriors (for the ""Cyber Girls"") or mythological beasts as well as stars in the <a class=""extiw"" title=""wikipedia:Draco (constellation)"">Draco constellation</a> (for the other ""Cyber"" monsters).

Although they are related to the ""<a title=""Cybernetic"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Cybernetic"">Cybernetic</a>"" archetype, they are a separate group of cards. Since all support for the ""Cyber"" archetype also supports the ""Cybernetic"" archetype, in the <i><a class=""mw-redirect"" title=""TCG"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/TCG"">TCG</a></i> (in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese), the ""Cybernetic"" archetype is treated as a subset of the ""Cyber"" archetype.

</ul>
They are a Deck with both <a title=""Swarm"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Swarm"">swarming</a> and speed capabilities. When <i><a title=""Crimson Crisis"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Crimson_Crisis"">Crimson Crisis</a></i> was released, this archetype was very unsupported, with only five ""Blackwing"" cards being released: ""<a title=""Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwing_-_Gale_the_Whirlwind"">Gale the Whirlwind</a>"", ""<a title=""Blackwing - Sirocco the Dawn"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwing_-_Sirocco_the_Dawn"">Sirocco the Dawn</a>"", ""<a title=""Blackwing - Bora the Spear"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwing_-_Bora_the_Spear"">Bora the Spear</a>"", ""<a title=""Blackwing Armor Master"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwing_Armor_Master"">Armor Master</a>"" and ""<a title=""Raptor Wing Strike"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Raptor_Wing_Strike"">Raptor Wing Strike</a>"". Later on, with the release of <i><a title=""Raging Battle"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Raging_Battle"">Raging Battle</a></i> and <i><a title=""Ancient Prophecy"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Prophecy"">Ancient Prophecy</a></i>, Blackwings grew into a high swarming and powerful Deck. The speed it gives with its swarming, along with its additional <a title=""Synchro Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Synchro_Summon"">Synchro Summoning</a> capabilities, landed this Deck a place on the <a title=""Shonen Jump"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shonen_Jump"">Shonen Jump</a> Circuit, along with being known as one of the many Meta Decks. The Deck proceeded to win the 2009 World Championships and remained popular the following year. New ""Blackwing"" monsters and support were released in <i><a title=""The Shining Darkness"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/The_Shining_Darkness"">The Shining Darkness</a></i> and <i><a title=""Starstrike Blast"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Starstrike_Blast"">Starstrike Blast</a></i>, giving them alternative strategies.

As of <i><a title=""Premium Gold: Return of the Bling"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Premium_Gold:_Return_of_the_Bling"">Premium Gold: Return of the Bling</a></i>, the deck's swarming capabilities and consistency have been greatly improved. With the release of <i>Dimension of Chaos </i>and <i>The Dark Illusion</i>, new ""Blackwing"" monsters, called ""Assault Blackwings"", have been introduced that gain the ability to be Tuner monsters allowing for more access to Synchro Summoning thanks to ""<a title=""Assault Blackwing - Onimaru the Divine Thunder"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Assault_Blackwing_-_Onimaru_the_Divine_Thunder"">Assault Blackwing - Onimaru the Divine Thunder</a>"" having level manipulation once Summoned. The deck functions with high amounts of speed, searching, and good hand trap situations as leaving a ""<a title=""Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwing_-_Kalut_the_Moon_Shadow"">Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow</a>"" in hand can be used both offensively and defensively.

If they leave the Extra Deck without being properly Special Summoned, they cannot be Special Summoned while they are banished or in the Graveyard.

Most Fusion Monsters have a set of <a title=""Fusion Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fusion_Material"">Fusion Materials</a>, which are listed on the first line of the <a title=""Card text"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_text"">card's text</a>. These are the <a title=""Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Material"">materials</a> used to perform the Summon of that monster.

Like other Extra Deck monsters, Fusion Monsters cannot exist in the <a title=""Hand"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Hand"">hand</a> or <a title=""Main Deck"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Deck"">Main Deck</a> (even with card effects). If a Fusion Monster would be moved to the hand or Main Deck, it is returned to the Extra Deck instead. If a card like ""<a title=""Transmigration Break"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Transmigration_Break"">Transmigration Break</a>"" or ""<a title=""Degenerate Circuit"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Degenerate_Circuit"">Degenerate Circuit</a>"" is applying, this will override the Fusion Monster's ability to return to the Extra Deck.

I added 2 parro very useful card especially if you have a heatleo in the graveyard or high attk salamangreat can come in handy clutch situations. Wovie is support I elected to have hiita over sunlight wolf the effect was more effective, and of course the fusion of fire cynet fusion is for violet chimera otk. raging flame sprite is clutch card in certain situations and can attack directly bypassing defense if you don't kill fast enough it can be a threat 1k every attack boost. I'm still on the fences about foxer I like its effect might try playing it take out 1 foxy see how it plays. Now around the time savage strike comes out the soul burner starter comes out as we all know so haven't done enough research on those salamangreats yet so that why they are not included."

Combo it with Eternal Soul for solid victory.,"Search Eternal Soul, a dragon-type monster (or Xyz Summon one from the Extra Deck), Dark Magician or King of the Swamp (as substitute) and Polymerization. When you collected all pieces, you are ready to go. You can also use The Eye of Timaeus to do so, but you have to Special Summon Dark Magician (or Magician of Dark Illusion) first. Also, The Eye of Timaeus cannot be searched unlike Polymerization.

Nothing can stop Dark Magician the Dragon Knight + Eternal Soul. Save Eternal Soul's effect to revive your fusion monsters from the GY in case they get kaijued or anything.

Most of this deck is based on the idea that dragons are so strong that there is little to no hope for those going against it.

When I sold all of my old cards these cards were the ones I kept due to me never losing a game with them.

The cards that may be on a ban list are able to be subbed out for similar cards with similar effects that are still legal, I just do not own those cards that are able to be swapped out.

The side deck still requires more cards that would allow for you to be able to switch out the main dragon/strategy to make it similar to how you may play a dragon deck , this is just one deck I currently use and own."

The Salamangreat cards give the deck a boost that it needs and makes it open to more combos. I dunno man it just works and is a blast to play! Enjoy and please leave input on improvements!

p.s. This will be the last revision I will make to this deck on the website but I basically took most of the salamangreat cards out and added more tech cards. I feel the deck is way more competitive now but sorry for changing it so much on day 1."

If your normal summon is negated, all a player can really do is pass turn at that point and more then likely lose. The addition of the brilliant fusion engine to the deck helps with that problem by having the potential to give the deck an extra normal summon to fall back on. It also provides two different typed monsters for folgo, (Being seraphinite and trick clown) letting you get into your boss monster fairly easily.

With fur hire's main gimmick being able to swarm the board, one can easily also go into any link monster one's hart desires for any situation. Such as borreload, or borrelsword dragon for OTKs, or the knightmares to out problem cards. There's also a small rank 4 engine in the extra deck for more niche situations.

Finally the side deck is geared almost souly for when you have to go second. The only card in the side deck that's not a going second card is cosmic cyclone. the side is build this way as, while two of the fur hire monsters can pop either a face up card or a face down when a fur hire monster is special summoned to the field, I feel fur hires do not do well going second so this side is made to mitigate that."

Droll is run at 2 in the side deck as he is not the best this format, and really can only be used when going second against darkworld danger FTK (run three is you want I just find having the raigeki) , and ash is good against almost any deck, so if you know your going second you can swap Vorse raider for those.

Sky Strikers have solidified themselves as the one of the best decks in the November 2018 TCG Metagame,sharing the Tier 1 Spot with Thunder Dragon and Danger!Dark World FTK.
It is a control deck that aims to gain enormous card advantage over the opponent to overwhelm and take over the game state.Going first it usually sets up 1-2 negates with recovery options ready for the next turn,and going second it is capable of breaking boards with their Maneuvers and Widow Anchors.
My version is the pure build,without combo cards like Scapegoat and Phantom Skyblaster.
<strong>The Deck</strong>:-
<strong>Starters,the deck's main play initiators,that require next to none,or no set up to play</strong>(15):
3x Sky Striker Ace - Raye
A crucial component of the deck,and the only normal summon in my build.She allows for instant access into any Sky Striker monster.The recovery effect also comes up often.The combo variant can get away with playing 2,but in the pure version you want 3.Losing a copy of Raye (banishing effects,etc) can be quite detrimental early on,especially in the mirror,and getting the next one in your GY is quite important.
2x Foolish Burial Goods
Dumps Metalfoes Fusion to the GY,and really helps Engage-less hands by sending Engage to the GY,caving the path for a follow-up Kagari to grab that Engage.3 clogs,1 doesnt come up as often as you'd want.
3x Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!
Without doubt the heart and soul of the deck.The deck revolves around repeatedly activating Engage to gain advantage. Being able to search any Sky Striker card is just too powerful to pass up on,and the draw 1 becomes really prominent late game. No less than 3,no exceptions(unless you can't afford the 3rd copy).
1x Reinforcement of the Army
Turbos out Raye from the deck.
1x Foolish Burial
Dumps Darkest Diabolos(see Darkest Diabolos,Lord of the Lair under ""Extenders"").
1x Hornet Drones
It became limited because of how generic the token-summoning effect was.You normally want to grab this only after you already have a Raye in your GY,for the recursion safety.
2x Terraforming
Turbos out Area Zero (see Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero).
2x Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero
Lets you potentially remove cards from your Main Monster Zone, make use of a drawn Metalfoes Fusion while gaining some advantage.You can pop it with Afterburners or Twin Twisters when you side it in (more on TwTw ahead) to get out a Raye from your deck as well.
<strong>Extenders,cards that require set up and are normally follow-up plays from starters</strong>(6):
1x Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair
The main usage of this card is its effect to reduce your opponent's starting hand by 1. Besides that,he is a 3000 ATK Body that is untargetable,proving invaluable against the mirror and Altergeist matchups. You want to get him in your GY early on so that he acts like another Raye to put the pressure on your opponent.
1x Monster Reborn
Free revival is always welcome.
1x Soul Charge
The bomb card you dont want to use unless you're going for game via something like Topologic Trisbaena or go into some control cards like Borreload or Ningirsu.
2x Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole
Generates immense advantage for the deck by allowing recycling of the Sky Striker spells. 3 is largely unneccesary, and 1 would be too fragile to disruption.
1x Sky Striker Mecharmory - Hercules Base
You don't want to see this card early on, and really only need 1 for the recycling effect, mainly to be used on your Sky Striker Extra Deck monsters.To be sent off of multirole or area zero to trigger its effect.

<strong>Defense,cards used to disrupt the opponent's plays</strong>(12):
3x Ghost Ogre and Snow Rabbit.
This slot can be used on any handtrap of preference,but other handtraps like Ash are currently not very strong versus the meta.
3x Sky Striker Mecha - Widow Anchor
Searchable negate. Stops your opponent's plays and the control effect is what you want to save the anchor for,so that they are left with less resources to make their plays. In the mirror, this can be chained to an opponent's anchor so they cant take control of it.
3x Infinite Impermaneance
Flexible card that works going first or second. Going first you'd want to set it in the middle zone so that it can negate an opponent's Spell/Trap card,and going second you can set this in the same zone as a way to block off a backrow piece.
3x Solemn Strike
Impermaneance as a slower,but counter trap version,meaning the opponent can only respond to it with other counter trap cards. The 1500 LP cost isn't significant, but if you're going into time I'd side it out.

Re-raisers,cards that stop an effect or action that would hamper your plays(3):
2x Called by the Grave
Because we can only run 2 now.Generic handtrap disruption is great,and if they dont have a handtrap you can always just set it as a means of disruption during your opponent's turn. This application is more prominent in the mirror, to banish their Raye.
1x Sky Striker Mecha - Eagle Booster
Avoid negation or stall out a game so you can Hayate or something. No more than 1 is really needed, it is easily accessible and floatible via multirole.

Placeholders,consistency cards(2):
1x Upstart Goblin
Consistency,also it is another spell in your GY for Sky Striker effects.
1x Metalfoes Fusion
Same as Upstart Goblin

<strong>Removal Cards,cards to pop threats</strong>(2):
1x Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners!
Free pops.
1x Sky Striker Maneuver - Jamming Waves
More versatile vs the Paleo or Altergeist matchup, its 2nd effect allows for non-targeting monster removal.

<strong>Extra Deck</strong>:
1x Linkuriboh
Drones into this. Helps gather materials for a Borreload or Knightmare.
3x Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku
A differently-wired Engage. You can use multirole to set a card from your GY that you want 2 of,then use this card's eff to get the 2nd copy.You go through Kagari and Shizuku rapidly through out a game
3x Sky Striker Ace - Kagari
Extremely important. You run out of your Kagaris even faster than your Shizukus. Use in tandem with things like Goods or Hayate to grab any Sky Striker spell from your deck
1x Sky Striker Ace - Hayate
Lets you deal damage more often, and adds to the versatility of the deck by fixing Engage-less hands going 2nd. You don't need more copies, besides you can recycle her with Hercules Base.
1x Knightmare Phoenix
Out floodgates,because this deck loses to most floodgates. Rivalry,Gozen,Anti-Spell,Imperial Order,you name it.Make under a linkuriboh when link-climbing to get the draw 1.
1x Knightmare Unicorn
A more costly,but stronger phoenix. Lets you out multiple type of cards as it can shuffle any type of card into the deck.
1x Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior
Out non-targetable cards like Ultimate Falcon which can lose you the game versus decks like Altergeist and Paleozoic. Its summoning condition is fairly easy to pull of mid-game,which is when your going to want to make this most of the time.
1x Firewall Dragon
Cherries target.
1x Borreload Dragon
One of your best outing materials in the deck, pretty similar to Darkest Diabolos, but this card lets you break apart already established boards by taking control of cards and beating over anything with its effect to lower by 500 combined with its 3000 body. All-round a great card,but its not so effective in the mirror, namely because of Widow Anchor.
1x Black Rose Dragon
Niche card just in here for the nuke effect,for late game in mind when you'd be losing. Get a Raye on board,then revive a Ghost Ogre in your GY via Monster Reborn or Soul Charge to synch for this and blow the board.A nice come-back card.
1xSuperbolt Thunder Dragon
Cherries Target.

<strong>Side Deck</strong>:
3x Ghost Reaper and Winter Cherries
Gouki and Danger World cant extra link or FTK you without their Firewall dragon. Thunder Dragons can get really hurt by this unless they have access to Thunder Dragon Fusion. Greatly reduces the stamina of Sky Striker decks in the mirror, with the added bonus that you may resolve it twice, banishing Kagari(higher priority) and then Shizuku (lower priority). A great side deck card for going 2nd in any deck that can afford the Extra Deck space.
3x Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast!
Out Extra Link boards with this searchable spell.
3x Shared Ride
Side this in going first to lower their plays significantly. Basically Maxx ""C"" as a spell.
3x Twin Twisters
Because this deck loses to floodgates bad. Altergeist is currently a Tier 2 deck, so it will have a decent appearance at events.
3x Evenly Matches
By far the best going 2nd card, works vs any deck. The only excuse you can have to not run this card is its price. I have screwed over many players by making them go 2nd Game 3 and siding this and other appropriate side deck cards in,because they'd side for going 2nd,when you're making them go first. It is a bit risky to pull this off,however it can easily win you the entire game quickly, especially when you are about to go into time.

<strong>End Thoughts</strong>:

Sky Striker is a control deck,hence why the low amount of extenders,and high amount of starters and defense cards. While the Pure Variant is, from my knowledge and experience, generally more predictable and easier to counter,it is more consistent and reliable in what it does compared to the Combo Variant that runs cards like Phantom Skyblaster and Scapegoat. I am personally still exploring the Combo Variant,and hope to write about that version in the future if possible!"

<b>Fusion Monsters</b> (Japanese:<i>Yūgō Monsutā</i>) are a type of <a title=""Monster Card"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Card"">Monster Card</a>. The color of their card frame is violet. These cards are placed in the <a title=""Extra Deck"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Extra_Deck"">Extra Deck</a>.

To be properly Special Summoned, Fusion Monsters must first be <a title=""Fusion Summon"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fusion_Summon"">Fusion Summoned</a> (unless otherwise specified). If they leave the Extra Deck without being properly Special Summoned, they cannot be Special Summoned while they are banished or in the Graveyard.

Most Fusion Monsters have a set of <a title=""Fusion Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fusion_Material"">Fusion Materials</a>, which are listed on the first line of the <a title=""Card text"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Card_text"">card's text</a>. These are the <a title=""Material"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Material"">materials</a> used to perform the Summon of that monster.

Like other Extra Deck monsters, Fusion Monsters cannot exist in the <a title=""Hand"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Hand"">hand</a> or <a title=""Main Deck"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Deck"">Main Deck</a> (even with card effects). If a Fusion Monster would be moved to the hand or Main Deck, it is returned to the Extra Deck instead. If a card like ""<a title=""Transmigration Break"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Transmigration_Break"">Transmigration Break</a>"" or ""<a title=""Degenerate Circuit"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Degenerate_Circuit"">Degenerate Circuit</a>"" is applying, this will override the Fusion Monster's ability to return to the Extra Deck.

Newest additions analysis:
<ol>
 	<li><a data-name=""Harpie Lady"">Harpie Lady</a> - strangely enough I decided to add 3 copies of her and remove 3 of her effect versions ( 1, 2 and 3). The fact that she is a normal monster means she can come in usage in places her sisters can not. You can use <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> to special summon her from the hand. (Use <a data-name=""Link Spider"">Link Spider</a> on <a data-name=""Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack"">Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</a>'s token). She is a necessity to use <a data-name=""Draco Masters of the Tenyi"">Draco Masters of the Tenyi</a>'s effect (more below). Tho I'd love a new alternative artwork. ^^'</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Pet Dragon"">Harpie's Pet Dragon</a><a data-name=""&lt;a data-name=&quot;Harpie's Pet Dragon&quot;&gt;Harpie's Pet Dragon&lt;/a&gt; - Fearsome Fire Blast""> - Fearsome Fire Blast</a> - The newest release from Konami. Lovely card, much needed for the reliability of the deck. Also a level 7 dragon to pair with <a data-name=""Harpie Channeler"">Harpie Channeler</a>. Can be searched with <a data-name=""Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms"">Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms</a> and <a data-name=""Hysteric Sign"">Hysteric Sign</a>.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a> - Oh boy do they hate this card. It's easily accessible in this deck. Cards that can search it are <a data-name=""Harpie Harpist"">Harpie Harpist</a> and <a data-name=""Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms"">Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms</a>. Cards that can special summon it are <a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a>, <a data-name=""Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon"">Raidraptor - Arsenal Falcon</a>,<a data-name=""Swallow's Nest""> Swallow's Nest</a>. Also <a data-name=""Harpie Dancer"">Harpie Dancer</a> can bounce a card so you can normal summon it from the hand.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Wing Requital"">Wing Requital</a> - <a data-name=""Pot of Greed"">Pot of Greed</a> for harpies. Extremely important. Use it before bringing out your dragons/extra deck monsters.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Monster Reborn"">Monster Reborn</a> - odd card for such a deck that can recycle it's resources as easily, but it's very useful in the newest version. Main targets are <a data-name=""Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds"">Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds</a>, a monster you threw in the GY with <a data-name=""Harpie's Pet Dragon - Fearsome Fire Blast"">Harpie's Pet Dragon - Fearsome Fire Blast</a>'s effect or any other card that can extend your plays.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Duster"">Harpie's Feather Duster</a> - Self explanatory. Can be searched by <a data-name=""Hysteric Sign"">Hysteric Sign</a> or <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Storm"">Harpie's Feather Storm</a>.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Swallow's Nest"">Swallow's Nest</a> - Sadly i removed our ''secret weapon'' called <a data-name=""Inferno Reckless Summon"">Inferno Reckless Summon</a> but it was necessary. It's not reliable in the current meta.</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Cyber Slash Harpie Lady"">Cyber Slash Harpie Lady</a> - Amazing card. Great effect with non target removal, also it's a level 5+ Harpie card (can help boosting <a data-name=""Harpie Perfumer"">Harpie Perfumer</a>, <a data-name=""Harpie Oracle"">Harpie Oracle</a> and <a data-name=""Harpie's Feather Rest"">Harpie's Feather Rest</a>'s power).</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Draco Masters of the Tenyi"">Draco Masters of the Tenyi</a> - Use it in desperate situations. It requires having normal monsters in your GY (your Harpie Lady).</li>
 	<li><a data-name=""Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty"">Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty</a> - When you summon him use his effect at the end of your turn to bring out  your barrier statue. Use his effect again at the opponent's next turn for extended plays (If he survives).</li>
</ol>
Decided to come back and update the deck because of the latest releases from Konami. This time with a simpler guide, covering the newest cards only.

Don't forget it's just a game, relax and have a great time playing!"
